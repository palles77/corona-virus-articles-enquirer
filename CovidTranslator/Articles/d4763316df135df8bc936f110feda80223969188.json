Excitation of these resonances leads to phenomena such as autofluorescence, infrared absorption and Raman scattering 20 . Other label-free imaging modalities commonly used in clinical settings, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound, achieve tissue penetration but suffer from poor resolution. As such, these techniques only provide whole tissue rather than molecular information and are not useful for cell culture-based experiments. Vibrational absorption spectroscopies (for example, infrared spectroscopy) -free imaging of cells and tissues using the natural vibrational contrast that arises from biomolecules like lipids as well as for imaging of exogenously added probes or drugs. High-resolution CARS microscopy combined with multimodal imaging has allowed for dynamic monitoring of cellular processes such as lipid metabolism and storage, the movement of organelles, adipogenesis and host-pathogen interactions and can also be used to track molecules within cells and tissues. The CARS imaging modality provides a unique tool for biological chemists to elucidate the state of a cellular environment without perturbing it and to perceive the functional effects of added molecules.",

            "text": "yield detailed information about the chemical bonds within a given sample. However, the low energy of the transitions involved requires excitation by longer wavelength radiation relative to fluorescence experiments. As a result, vibrational absorption microscopies generally have inherently low spatial resolution. Vibrational scattering spectroscopies including Raman scattering techniques offer slightly better resolution with similar information about the unique chemical bonds within a given sample but suffer from low sensitivity; thus, imaging requires high laser power and long acquisition times, which are incompatible with live-cell imaging 21 . Poor sensitivity in Raman scattering detection can be overcome using enhancement techniques such as surfaceenhanced Raman scattering 22-25 , which gives near-single molecule sensitivity for biological imaging but involves labeling, typically with functionalized metal nanoparticles [26] [27] [28] [29] . On the other hand, CARS, which is a nonlinear optical version of Raman scattering (Box 1, Fig. 1 ), offers the same natural chemical contrast as linear Raman but with much better sensitivity 21,30-32 . As a result of the pioneering work in this field by X.S. Xie and coworkers, it is now possible to obtain Raman images of live cells nondestructively 32 . CARS microscopy, being a multiphoton method, also has very high spatial resolution typical of other multiphoton microscopies. Although there are distinct Raman scattering signals for peptides and nucleic acids that are clearly visible when using Raman imaging techniques on cells (Box 1), the strongest signal arises from lipidic C-H bond stretches. Thus the vast majority of applications of CARS microscopy to date have involved lipid imaging. Although this may seem limiting at first, the roles of lipids are so numerous and diverse in biology that the ability to image them has provided insight into a vast diversity of processes. Lipids make up all cellular membranes, control phenomena that are critical for cell signaling and function and mediate processes such as entry and secretion within a cell [11] [12] [13] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Lipids are also an important source of raw materials and energy. The dysregulation of lipid biogenesis, storage and metabolism can give rise to a number of disease states including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration and cancer 37 .",

Here we review the application of CARS microscopy for label-free imaging of cells and tissues using the natural vibrational contrast that arises from biomolecules like lipids as well as for imaging of exogenously added probes or drugs. High-resolution CARS microscopy combined with multimodal imaging has allowed for dynamic monitoring of cellular processes such as lipid metabolism and storage, the movement of organelles, adipogenesis and host-pathogen interactions and can also be used to track molecules within cells and tissues. The CARS imaging modality provides a unique tool for biological chemists to elucidate the state of a cellular environment without perturbing it and to perceive the functional effects of added molecules.",

            "text": "yield detailed information about the chemical bonds within a given sample. However, the low energy of the transitions involved requires excitation by longer wavelength radiation relative to fluorescence experiments. As a result, vibrational absorption microscopies generally have inherently low spatial resolution. Vibrational scattering spectroscopies including Raman scattering techniques offer slightly better resolution with similar information about the unique chemical bonds within a given sample but suffer from low sensitivity; thus, imaging requires high laser power and long acquisition times, which are incompatible with live-cell imaging 21 . Poor sensitivity in Raman scattering detection can be overcome using enhancement techniques such as surfaceenhanced Raman scattering [22] [23] [24] [25] , which gives near-single molecule sensitivity for biological imaging but involves labeling, typically with functionalized metal nanoparticles [26] [27] [28] [29] . On the other hand, CARS, which is a nonlinear optical version of Raman scattering (Box 1, Fig. 1 ), offers the same natural chemical contrast as linear Raman but with much better sensitivity 21, [30] [31] [32] . As a result of the pioneering work in this field by X.S. Xie and coworkers, it is now possible to obtain Raman images of live cells nondestructively 32 . CARS microscopy, being a multiphoton method, also has very high spatial resolution typical of other multiphoton microscopies. Although there are distinct Raman scattering signals for peptides and nucleic acids that are clearly visible when using Raman imaging techniques on cells (Box 1), the strongest signal arises from lipidic C-H bond stretches. Thus the vast majority of applications of CARS microscopy to date have involved lipid imaging. Although this may seem limiting at first, the roles of lipids are so numerous and diverse in biology that the ability to image them has provided insight into a vast diversity of processes. Lipids make up all cellular membranes, control phenomena that are critical for cell signaling and function and mediate processes such as entry and secretion within a cell [11] [12] [13] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Lipids are also an important source of raw materials and energy. The dysregulation of lipid biogenesis, storage and metabolism can give rise to a number of disease states including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neurodegeneration and cancer 37 . The details of these processes are not fully understood, their study having been stagnated by the inherent difficulty in studying lipids. Past methods such as Nile red staining or lipid extraction have allowed visualization and component analysis separately, but researchers have never easily been able to track lipids dynamically in living systems. Thus, CARS microscopy fills a very important and long-vacant niche in studying lipid biology.",

However, it is important to realize the limitations of this tool. In this section, we outline the scope of CARS Raman scattering spectroscopy detects the vibrations inherent in molecules without the need for dyes or fluorescent labeling. The signals generated result from inelastic scattering of photons with an energy shift that is characteristic of specific molecular vibrations (Fig. 1a , upper panel, and Fig. 1b , left panel). Despite the obvious appeal for biological imaging, single-photon Raman imaging has been limited by low signals because the majority of photons are scattered elastically (no energy shift). The advent of coherent Raman spectroscopy brings many advantages, prominent among them a thousand-fold improvement in signal intensity. The phenomenon of coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering occurs when a target molecule is irradiated using two short-pulse laser beams, the pump beam and the Stokes beam. Importantly, the frequencies of these two beams must be tuned such that the frequency difference corresponds to a vibration of the target. When this condition is met, coherently vibrating molecules in the probe volume (that is, the focal point of the pump and Stokes beams) will scatter the probe beam, resulting in a coherent signal with a higher frequency than that of the probe beam and a much higher intensity than the signal from spontaneous Raman scattering (Fig. 1a , lower panel, and Fig. 1b , right panel).",

            "text": "The greatest advantage of CARS, its basis in inherent molecular vibrations, also represents one of its greatest limitations. To achieve natural contrast with CARS, it is necessary to have a high concentration of the same molecular moiety. For this reason, lipids, with their long aliphatic chains full of -CH 2 groups, are perfectly suited to CARS imaging. This is quite apparent when examining the individual Raman spectra of cellular components (Fig. 1c) . The largest signal present in the Raman spectrum of the whole cell is from the C-H stretch of each component but is predominantly from the lipid (fat) component. Conveniently, lipids are also one of the biomolecules that can benefit from label-free imaging by CARS microscopy. Their size is on par with or smaller than the size of most common fluorescent labels, so lipid labeling is likely to perturb both lipid function and transport. Also apparent from the spectra in Figure 1c is the potential to use smaller Raman labels with Raman signals in the \"silent region, \" for example -CD or -CN. microscopy so that an appreciation of its true capabilities and potential applications can be highlighted. With the high spatial resolution typical of multiphoton microscopies and fast image acquisition rates, CARS microscopy has proven to be an excellent imaging modality for monitoring C-H vibrational stretches in lipids and O-H stretches in water. However, because this is a nonlinear technique that depends on three photons to coherently stimulate a resonance frequency, the CARS signal depends on the square of the concentration of vibrational oscillators in the focal volume of the material being imaged. For this reason, the enhanced sensitivity associated with CARS drops off quickly with decreasing oscillator concentration, and the imaging of less abundant biomolecules is difficult. Although it is difficult to define a detection limit because of the different methods for performing CARS microscopy, typically 10 5 to 10 6 oscillators per focal volume produce sufficient contrast, making this a much less sensitive technique than fluorescence imaging. CARS images often show some spectral distortion and limited sensitivity arising from unwanted background signals (referred to as nonresonant background) 21, 30, 70 . Because of these issues, quantifying CARS signals can present a challenge. There are, however, tools available to achieve relative quantification. Changes in signal intensity relative to control samples, even if semiquantitative in nature, can give important information about biological phenomena over time in living systems. In some of the examples we will discuss, image analysis algorithms have been applied to correct for the nonlinear effects of CARS microscopy 38, 62, 71 . Another approach that has been used for the analysis of CARS images is called voxel analysis 39, 40, 43, 72 . This tool calculates signal intensity within a field of view as a function of pixel volume, and only those pixels that meet a minimum threshold signal are counted 39, 40, 43, 72 . Using methods such as these for the systematic analysis of CARS images allows for the quantification of changes that are independent of unwanted background signals. For most applications of CARS microscopy, the intensity of the CARS signal is not the only important observable criterion in studying biological processes. Changes in features such as size, spatial distribution and morphology do not necessarily involve significant changes in the concentration of vibrational oscillators in the focal volume. These features are often as important, if not more important, than the intensity of the signal in terms of understanding a chemical or biochemical event. Many of the examples highlighted within this review fall into this category.",

Introduction of a label into these molecules makes it possible to track them with CARS imaging. Ideally the label should possess a vibration in the Raman silent region of the cell (Box 1) without altering any other properties. Perhaps the best example of such a label is the replacement of hydrogen by deuterium. This strategy was employed to help elucidate the health benefits imparted by fish oil that arise from polyunsaturated fatty acids such as oleic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) 84 . The -CD 2 vibration in deuterated oleic acid is 2,105 cm -1 , significantly shifted from the -CH 2 in nondeuterated oleic acid, which appears at 2,850 cm -1 (ref. 84 ). In the presence of EPA, deuterated oleic acid and EPA were found to colocalize within lysosomes in the form of triglycerides. In the absence of EPA, oleic acid did not accumulate in lysosomes, thus shedding light on how such polyunsaturated acids participate in lipid metabolism and what processes lead to the observed health benefits. Deuterated small molecules have also been used to show the signal-to-noise benefits of frequency modulation CARS 85 for studying membrane partitioning in a nonperturbative manner 86 and for monitoring aquaporin function in the diffusion of water 87 .

For example, as will be discussed in a subsequent section, whole-tissue imaging can be complemented by simultaneous subcellular imaging. In addition, multiplex CARS spectroscopic imaging provides detailed information on the chemical composition of the sample, measuring the Raman spectrum for each submicron pixel of the CARS image. By using multiplex CARS tuning to two different vibrational signatures (C=C and C-H stretches), one study successfully quantified the degree of fatty acid unsaturation and the amount of acyl chain order in HeLa cells and adipocytes 71 . Recently the enzymatic functions of proteins involved in lipolysis have also been monitored by multiplex CARS 38 . Triglycerides within lipid droplets were shown to be distinguishable from their lipolysis products on the basis of the characteristic Raman signals for each molecule 38 . Multiplex CARS was used to carry out component analysis of the digestion of glyceryl trioleate by porcine pancreatic lipase into its lipolytic products in vitro. Changes in the CARS spectrum between 2,800-3,100 cm -1 gave quantitative information about the rate of digestion within a lipid droplet 38 . Hyperspectral analysis of the Raman spectrum of each pixel allowed quantification of the different chemical components, whereby the spectra are deconvoluted (treated as a linear combination of the component spectra) and the relative concentration of each component is visualized as a false color image (see Fig. 3 (ref. 38) ). This technique was also used to distinguish between the bioactive molecules ergosterol, progesterone and vitamin D contained within lipid droplets to aid in understanding the physiological transport and absorption of these molecules as well as their effects on lipolysis 38 . It should be noted that Raman spectra obtained via CARS imaging are more complex than those from linear Raman spectroscopy and therefore require higher level analysis. However, the data treatment used in the above examples should be able to distinguish any set of molecules with distinct Raman signals. As such, multiplex CARS is becoming an increasingly attractive tool in chemical biology, providing all the benefits of CARS microscopy with detailed Raman spectroscopic data.",

Any molecular oscillator can be monitored by CARS, provided it is found in sufficiently high local concentrations to give chemical contrast. For example, CARS microscopy has been applied to monitoring drug release from polymer and bead samples used as drug delivery agents. In this case, both the delivery agent and drug must have unique vibrational modes that can be used to individually identify and monitor them. Paclitaxel release has been studied in this manner 66 . Raman vibrations that arise from the aromatic groups within the drug and that are absent in the surrounding poly(ethylene glycol)/ poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG/PLGA) polymer coatings were used to follow the drug changes in the release over time from a coated polymer by CARS microscopy. This allowed researchers to study how changes in the polymer composition affected the rate of drug release into solution. Recently, this approach was applied to monitoring the release of theophylline (dimethylxanthine), a drug commonly used to treat respiratory conditions, from solid lipid-based tablets upon dissolution in an aqueous medium 69 . As CARS microscopy is well suited to live-cell imaging, we have only begun to realize its potential to visualize dynamic processes during drug delivery and to aid in characterization in physiologically relevant settings.

The tool allowed for correlation between CES1 levels in hepatoma cells and the size and density of lipid droplets, which are necessary for the functional VLDL pathway and are a likely vehicle for HCV particle assembly and secretion. The multimodal strategy allowed for a better understanding of CES1's role, as the host factor was found to concentrate around lipid droplets near the endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting the protein loading of neutral lipids to ER-associated lipid droplets is crucial for HCV replication and maturation of HCV virion.

C. elegans was used to examine the details of metabolic diseases that involve changes in lipid stores on the single-cell level in vivo 39 . Interestingly, CARS microscopy was able to visualize hypodermal lipid droplets that were not visible or quantifiable by other methods (Fig. 5) 39 . Specifically, the technique was used to quantify changes in lipid stores in genetic mutants in which metabolic pathways affecting lipid storage had been previously established. A feeding-defective mutant called pha-3 showed a decrease in lipid content of approximately one-third compared to that of control organisms, as measured by lipid volume fraction 39 . In contrast, other mutants such as daf-2 and daf-4 with impaired insulin growth factor and transforming growth factor signaling pathways, respectively, showed significantly increased lipid volumes, a change in lipid phase and an increased number of lipid droplets in hypodermal cells 39 . This example highlights one of the advantages label-free imaging has over fluorescent labeling and staining. The researchers were unable to observe hypodermal lipid droplets via Nile red fluorescence. The authors attributed this to one of two factors: either the Nile red reaches these lipid droplets less efficiently (metabolic effect) or the fluorescence is less efficient in the environment of the hypodermal lipid droplets (photophysical effect).

Assessing tissue lipid content with CARS microscopy is also relevant in cancer pathology 51 . CARS is currently being used to understand the link between obesity and breast cancer. Using this technique, it has been shown that the mammary glands of obese rats contain elevated levels of adipocytes with increased sizes of lipid droplets 98 . By combining CARS, second harmonic generation and TPF, the authors were able to image several components of the mammary stroma, thus lending insight into the dynamics of the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, CARS has been used to probe the association of lipid-rich tumors with increased tumor metastasis, tracking intracellular lipid accumulation in primary, circulating and metastasized cancer cells 51 .",

As such, CARS microscopy may prove to be very valuable in the study of the disease, improvement in diagnosis and discovery of new treatments. To aid in understanding the pathogenesis of plaque vulnerability, multiplex CARS spectroscopy has been used to identify and characterize the chemical profiles of four types of atherosclerotic lipids ( Fig. 6c-f) 41 . Prior to this application of CARS, such information was only available through indirect analyses after sample removal and processing or via dissection imaging. The effect of statin drugs on the chemical profiles of the plaques was also measured with specific reference to plaque stability. Although the morphologies of lipid-rich features remained unchanged, the chemical composition of each feature was quite different for cells treated with statins 41 . After eight weeks of treatment with simvastatin, lipid crystals were less solidified, as evidenced by a decrease in the signal intensities assigned to the asymmetrical -CH 2 and -CH 3 vibrations 41 .",

Also, CARS endoscopy has been on the horizon since the recent development of a fiber-delivered probe able to collect the back-scattered, forward-generated CARS signal in biological tissues 100 . A CARS endoscope will provide access to deeper tissues in vivo, inviting a wealth of applications in clinical diagnostics such as in situ imaging of tumor margins and atherosclerotic plaques, among others. It is clear that CARS has a future in clinical imaging. CARS is able to fill the role of histological staining and biochemical analysis in several applications, achieving the same result while avoiding tissue fixation and use of reagents. Furthermore, CARS complements MRI applications, as it is a label-free and nondestructive modality. Although CARS cannot match the tissue penetration that MRI provides, it achieves far greater resolution. The ability of CARS to be used simultaneously with other imaging modalities makes it particularly attractive.",

            "text": "The most powerful aspect of CARS microscopy is that it can report with high resolution on the chemical and biological nature of any sample using inherent Raman vibrational resonances, provided the resonances are sufficiently distinct and in high enough local concentration. Many of the applications of CARS microscopy to date have focused on imaging lipids and monitoring their phenotypic changes in response to a chemical or biological perturbation. The themes highlighted in this review speak to the relevance of results obtained with CARS microscopy to problems in health and disease and highlight the opportunities for further investigation both in terms of imaging and discovery. CARS microscopy increases the repertoire of today's chemical biologist and, notably, provides the previously unavailable ability to dynamically monitor biological systems with chemical specificity. Additionally, there remains great potential for this technique to image exogenous molecules, to perform high-throughput screening and to visualize chemical reactions that are of relevance to biology. Constant improvements in methods related to CARS microscopy (such as SRS microscopy) and in optics are increasing its capacity to image less abundant target molecules and expanding the possible applications of this technique. These advances are also driving the progress toward exciting clinical imaging applications. Given the recent commercialization of a CARS microscope, based on the design by Pegoraro et al. 75 , and thus the increased accessibility of the technique, we envision its routine usage in a wide variety of fields in the near future.
