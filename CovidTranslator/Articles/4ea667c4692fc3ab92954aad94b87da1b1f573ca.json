            "text": "The paramyxovirus family includes important human pathogens such as measles, mumps, respiratory syncytial virus and the recently emerged, highly pathogenic Hendra and Nipah viruses. The viral fusion (F) protein plays critical roles in infection, promoting both the viral-cell membrane fusion events needed for viral entry as well as cell-cell fusion events leading to syncytia formation. We describe the surprising finding that addition of the short epitope HA tag to the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the Hendra virus F protein leads to a significant increase in cell-cell membrane fusion. This increase was not due to alterations in surface expression, cleavage state, or association with lipid microdomains. Addition of a Myc tag of similar length did not alter Hendra F fusion activity, indicating that the observed stimulation was not solely a result of lengthening the CT. Three tyrosine residues within the HA tag were critical for the increase in fusion, suggesting C-terminal tyrosines may modulate Hendra fusion activity. The effects of HA tag addition varied with other fusion proteins, as parainfluenza virus 5 F-HA showed decreased surface expression and no stimulation in fusion. These results indicate that additions to the C-terminal end of the F protein CT can modulate protein function in a sequence specific manner, reinforcing the need for careful analysis of epitope tagged glycoproteins. In addition, our results implicate C-terminal tyrosine residues in modulation of the membrane fusion reaction promoted by these viral glycoproteins.",

G binding to the cellular receptors ephrinB2 and/or B3 (16, 17) is hypothesized to disrupt the F-G interaction, leading to triggering of membrane fusion by F (15, (18) (19) (20) . Mutations that inhibit the F-G interaction also inhibit membrane fusion (18) , and F-G avidity is inversely proportional with fusion activity (19, 20) . Once F is triggered, the FP inserts into the target membrane and the HRB and HRA domains form a six helix bundle complex, which is hypothesized to provide the energy necessary for membrane merger.

The crystal structures of the prefusion form of PIV5 F (22) and of the postfusion forms of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) F (23) (24) (25) have been solved, greatly contributing to understanding of the refolding events that take place in the ectodomain of paramyxovirus fusion proteins. However, the crystal structures lack the membrane-interacting TM domain and the CT of F, two regions that have also been shown to play important roles in the fusion process (2, 26, 27) .",

Surprisingly, addition of the HA tag to Hendra F significantly increased membrane fusion activity. To examine if extending the Hendra F CT stimulates fusion activity in a sequence independent manner, a Myc epitope tag was added (EQKLISEEDL). No increase in fusion was observed, suggesting a sequence-specific effect of the HA tag. Further mutational analysis demonstrated that the three tyrosine residues present in the HA tag are critical for the observed fusion stimulation. Finally, to determine if HA tag-stimulated fusion is a general effect, the HA tag was added to the CT tail of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) F protein. Fusion stimulation was not observed, and overall protein expression was significantly reduced. These results indicate that the C-terminal end of the Hendra F CT modulates fusion in a sequence specific manner, with tyrosine residues in this region specifically enhancing membrane fusion activity.",

Recent data from our laboratory has found that cytoplasmic tail aromatic residues modulate Hendra F protein-promoted membrane fusion (Gibson et al., manuscript in preparation). To test the potential role of the HA tag tyrosine residues, we created two additional mutants, F-HA2YA, where the first two tyrosine residues in the HA tag were substituted with alanine, and F-HA3YA, where all three tyrosine residues were mutated to alanine (Fig. 1) .",

When quantified by the reporter gene assay, the level of membrane fusion promoted by F-HA2YA was about 25% lower than that of F-HA. F-HA3YA fusion was approximately half of that observed for F-HA, and comparable to that of wt Hendra F (Fig.  4D) .

To check if the addition of the HA tag to the cytoplasmic tail stimulated fusion promoted by other paramyxovirus fusion proteins, the HA epitope tag was added to the cytoplasmic tail of the distantly related PIV5 fusion protein or the closely related Nipah virus fusion protein. For PIV5 F, protein surface expression and cleavage state were analyzed by surface biotinylation after an overnight label (Fig. 5A) . Although PIV5 F-HA was expressed and proteolytically cleaved, surface density for this mutant was approximately 35% of that of PIV5 F, suggesting that the HA tag alters PIV5 F protein expression or stability. The fusion activity of PIV F-HA was tested using the syncytia assay and the reporter gene assay, as described above. The syncytia assay showed a decrease in fusion mediated by PIV5 F-HA relative to PIV5 F (Fig. 5C ). The luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that the level of fusion promoted by PIV5 F-HA was approximately 25% of that of wt PIV5 F (Fig. 5B) , whereas its surface expression was about 35% of that of PIV5 F. These results suggest that the HA tag does not have a significant stimulatory effect on fusion promoted by PIV5 F-HA, as previous studies have shown that PIV5 F surface densities and the fusion activity correlate in an approximately linear fashion. (37, 38) . In contrast, HA-tagged Nipah F gave increased fusion by both reporter gene and syncytia assays when transfected at similar levels as the wt Nipah F (data not shown), suggesting that the stimulatory effect of C-terminal tyrosines is conserved among the Henipavirus F proteins.",

Truncations of the CT of NDV, PIV3 and PIV5 greatly decrease or abolish membrane fusion (42) (43) (44) . Deletion of the CT of PIV5 was shown to inhibit fusion pore expansion (45) , while deletion of the CT of HPIV3 strongly affects F oligomerization (44) . However, removal of the CT did not affect fusion activity for HPIV2 (44) . In addition to the CT truncations, it has also been shown that increasing the length of the CT can also inhibit membrane fusion. Elongation of the CT of influenza virus hemagglutinin with one to six histidine residues significantly reduced fusion activity (46) . Moreover, some retroviral fusion proteins with longer CT (e.g., Moloney murine leukemia virus, Mason-Pfizer monkey virus) have to be partially cleaved by a viral protease in order to efficiently promote fusion (47) (48) (49) (50) , and truncations in the CT of HIV Env have been shown to increase syncytia formation (51) . The CT of the fusion protein of SER virus, the porcine variant of PIV5, is 22 amino acids longer than that of PIV5 F, but SER F is unable to promote syncytia formation (41) . However, recent studies have shown that it is not the length of the SER F CT per se which alters membrane fusion, but the sequence of the CT (41) . In the case of SER F, two CT leucine residues are responsible for inhibiting membrane fusion, and their substitution to alanine completely restores fusion to levels similar with PIV5 F (41) . Taken together, these studies demonstrate that the CT can be an important modulator of folding and fusion, but a global understanding of the mechanism remains to be elucidated.",

Waning and colleagues have shown that elongating the CT of PIV5 F protein with elements that stabilize the F trimer prevents the ectodomain conformational changes needed for fusion activity (40) , leading to a significant drop in fusion (40) . As Hendra F-HA displays a hyperfusogenic phenotype, destabilization of protein-protein interactions by the HA tag is possible, but a mechanism for this is not clear. It is also possible that the tyrosine residues are involved in interactions with other cellular proteins. Weise and colleagues have recently shown that the tyrosine residues within Nipah fusion and attachment protein cytoplasmic tails are important for proper basolateral trafficking in polarized epithelial cells, and interaction with cytosolic adaptor proteins has been discussed (52) . While the studies conducted here were not in polarized cells, interaction of C-tail tyrosines with specific cellular proteins could well alter membrane fusion promotion.",

            "text": "Alternatively, the CT residues may influence association with the plasma membrane. Once fusion is triggered, the HRB regions separate, and major conformational changes lead to the formation of a six helix bundle, where HRB and HRA are positioned in an anti-parallel arrangement (2) . During the fusion process, the TM domains must rotate in the plane of the membrane, with the C-terminal region of the TM going deeper into the bilayer, potentially pulling at least part of the CT into the lipid interface and rearranging of the lipid phase (26, 53) . Interestingly, the CT of several class I fusion proteins (HIV-1 Env, Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus S, Influenza virus HA) has been suggested to associate with the plasma membrane, potentially dehydrating the viral membranes and minimizing the energy required for pore enlargement (2, 39, 54, 55) . For coronavirus S it was shown that decreasing the palmitoylation of the juxtamembranous cysteine residues leads to a reduction in membrane fusion and viral entry (39) . Statistical evidence from analysis of proteins of known structure has shown that aromatic residues are highly enriched at the membranewater interface and have a strong tendency to partition into this interface (56, 57) . Furthermore, in monotopic proteins, which associate with the surface of membranes but lack a TM domain, it was shown that a high percent of Tyr and Trp are directed toward the membrane, playing roles in stabilizing and anchoring the proteins (57) . It is possible that the tyrosine residues in the HA tag associate with the plasma membrane at the membrane-water interface, causing the Hendra F CT to loop back toward the lipid bilayer. This could potentially destabilize and/or dehydrate the lipid phase, minimizing the energy required for membrane fusion, as proposed before (2, 26) . This would facilitate the rotation of the TM within the bilayer, correlating with the increased levels in fusion.",

Moreover, the structure of AP2 in which both Yxx\u03a6 and [ED]xxxl[LI] binding sites are occupied suggests that a molecule containing both these motifs could use both of them to interact with AP2 only if the two endocytosis motifs are at least 25 residues apart. However, the Hendra F YSRL and Myc EQKLI motifs are only 18 residues apart, suggesting that only one of these motifs at a time can be used for AP2 binding and the Hendra F endocytosis needed for subsequent cathepsin L proteolytic processing. Thus, the Myc acidic dileucinelike motif may interfere with Hendra F CT YSRL binding to AP2, leading to the slowed cathepsin L processing seen for Hendra F-Myc.",
