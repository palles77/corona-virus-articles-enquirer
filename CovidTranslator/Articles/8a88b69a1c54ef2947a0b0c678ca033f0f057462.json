We have previously reported the synthesis of potent coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) inhibitors and the efficacy of a protease inhibitor, GC376, in client-owned cats with FIP. In this study, we studied the effect of the amino acid changes in 3CLpro of feline coronavirus from a feline patient who received antiviral treatment for prolonged duration. We generated recombinant 3CLpro containing the identified amino acid changes (N25S, A252S or K260 N) and determined their susceptibility to protease inhibitors in the fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. The assay showed that N25S in 3CLpro confers a small change (up to 1.68-fold increase in the 50% inhibitory concentration) in susceptibility to GC376, but other amino acid changes do not affect susceptibility. Modelling of 3CLpro carrying the amino acid changes was conducted to probe the structural basis for these findings. The results of this study may explain the observed absence of clinical resistance to the long-term antiviral treatment in the patients.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are a group of diverse RNA viruses that can cause a number of diseases in animals and humans. Coronaviruses have a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome and belong to the family Coronaviridae, which are further classified into four genera, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Deltacoronaviruses (King et al., 2011) . Feline coronaviruses belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus and are the causative agent of enteritis in cats. Feline enteric coronavirus infections are quite common in multi-cat environments, such as shelters, rescues and catteries. Since more than a third of the affected cats chronically shed viruses in the stool and feline coronaviruses are relatively stable in the environment, it is difficult to eliminate feline coronaviruses from the affected cat populations (Addie et al., 2019; Pedersen et al., 2008) . Cats infected with feline coronaviruses may show mild to severe enteritis, but they usually recover without complications. However, a small number of cats may develop feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a highly fatal, systemic disease, following enteric coronavirus infection (Pedersen, 2009 (Pedersen, , 2014 . The detailed mechanism of FIP development is still elusive, but it is believed that FIP arises in individual cats through altered viral tropism that allows viral replication in the macrophages (Barker et al., 2013; Chang et al., 2012; Licitra et al., 2013; Pedersen et al., 2009 Pedersen et al., , 2012 in the presence of inadequate cellular immunity of the affected cats (Pedersen, 2014) . FIP are commonly described as wet or dry forms based on the presence or absence of effusion, respectively, but these forms may switch as the disease progresses in some cats. The clinical signs of FIP are variable and depend on the affected organs and may include fever, jaundice, effusion, weight loss or neurological signs and ocular lesions (Pedersen, 2014) . Although FIP is almost invariably fatal once cats develop clinical signs, there is no commercially available treatment licensed for FIP with only supportive treatment being available.",

He was diagnosed with FIP based on physical examination, signalment, clinical history, laboratory test results on blood and effusion prior to the enrollment in the trial (Pedersen et al., 2018) . At admission, he exhibited lethargy, inappetance and abdominal effusion with enlarged colonic lymph node and had been treated with antibiotics and prednisolone prior to entry into the trial. The first round of treatment (GC376 at 10 to 30 mg/kg/ injection, twice daily) lasted for 9 weeks. One month after discontinuation of the treatment, he relapsed with fever and lethargy and was re-treated (GC376 at 7.5 to 15 mg/kg/injection, twice daily) for 12 weeks. During these treatments, he remained in clinical remission. However, about 5 weeks following the discontinuation of the second treatment, he relapsed again with typical intra-abdominal lesions without neurological signs and was euthanized (Pedersen et al., 2018) . The time between the first day of treatment and euthanasia is 236 days. On necropsy, tissue samples were collected and prepared for sequence analysis of feline coronavirus 3CLpro (Pedersen et al., 2018) .

There was no statistically significant difference in the activity among the 3CLpros, which indicates that the amino acid changes do not affect the function of 3CLpro compared to that of WT 3CLpro (Fig. 2) . When the inhibitory activity of GC376 was determined against the WT and mutant 3CLpros, it was found that single amino acid change of N25S, but not A252S or K260 N, led to a statistically significant increase in the IC 50 value of GC376, compared to that of WT 3CLpro ( Fig. 3A and B) . However, the increase in the IC 50 value was marginal with a fold-change of 1.38 in IC 50 . The 3CLpro carrying a double mutation (N25S and N260 N) or a triple mutation (N25S, A252S and K260 N) also significantly increased the IC 50 value of GC376 by 1.53 and 1.68-fold, respectively, compared to WT 3CLpro. However, the IC 50 values of GC376 against 3CLpro with a double or a triple mutation were not statistically different from that of 3CLpro carrying a single mutation of N25S ( Fig. 3A and B) . These findings indicate that A252S and K260 N mutations do not affect the susceptibility of 3CLpro against GC376. NPI52 is a tripeptidyl compound that shares a similar backbone structure with GC376 and has a similarly potent activity against feline coronavirus as GC376 in the FRET assay and cell culture (Kim et al., 2015) . However, unlike those of GC376, there was no difference in the IC 50 values of 3CLpro with WT, single, double or triple mutations against NPI52 (Fig.3A and B) .",

The N25 is adjacent to the catalytic site, while A252 and K260 are located in the domain III near the C terminus. Multiple sequence analysis of feline coronavirus strains whose 3CLpro sequences are available in the PubMed database showed that N25 and A252 are invariably conserved in all feline coronavirus strains and K260 is also highly conserved with only one strain having Arg (R) at the same position (Fig. 4A) . Multiple sequence alignment of feline coronavirus 3CLpro also revealed that the residues that form hydrogen bond interactions with GC376 in TGEV 3CLpro (T47, F139 H162, H163 and E165) (Kim et al., 2012a) are conserved in all feline coronaviruses (Data not shown). Superposition of the homology structure of CT10 3CLpro (WT) and the crystal structures of TGEV-GC376 (PDB accession number: 4F49) and feline coronavirus 3CLpro (PDB accession number: 4ZRO) showed that these residues (T47, F139 H162, H163 and E165) are aligned closely in the catalytic site of 3CLpro ( Fig. 4B and C) , suggesting that these residues likely form hydrogen bonds with GC376 in feline coronavirus 3CLpro.

Emergence of drug resistance is influenced by multiple factors, such as patient compliance, immune status of patients, suboptimal dosage, drug potency, genetic barrier of a drug to resistance, viral fitness or the biology of virus (reviewed in (Gotte, 2012; Strasfeld and Chou, 2010) ). Drug resistance is caused by the development of viral mutations that arise during antiviral treatment or by preexisting virus variants that carry such mutations. Viral mutations can confer various levels of reduced susceptibility or resistance to a drug, and clinically meaningful drug resistance can arise when viral replication is insufficiently suppressed by plasma drug concentrations. Antiviral compounds have varying genetic barriers to resistance. Those with low genetic barriers relatively readily lead to the emergence of mutations associated with clinically meaningful resistance and may not be suitable for monotherapy or longer duration of treatment. In contrast, those with high genetic barriers have reduced risks of developing resistance during antiviral treatment (reviewed in (Gotte, 2012; Strasfeld and Chou, 2010) ). Therefore, identifying and understanding drug resistance of an antiviral compound can help effective treatment regime to be devised.",

Serotype I feline coronaviruses are the predominant type in the field, but they hardly grow in cell culture. In our previous study, we reported that serial passages of a serotype II feline coronavirus in the presence of GC376 in cell culture did not lead to emergence of resistant viruses for up to 20 passages, although a tripeptidyl compound (NPI52) that shares a similar backbone structure with GC376 readily led to resistant viruses (Kim et al., 2016) . In the field trial, we identified amino acid changes in feline coronavirus 3CLpro from a feline patient that received intermittent treatment for the duration of about 8 months (Fig. 1) (Pedersen et al., 2018) . This patient did not show evidence of clinical drug resistance during treatment. However, we set out to study the nature of those amino acid changes in 3CLpro. The feline coronavirus from the patient is a serotype I strain based on the sequence analysis of the regions spanning the spike gene. To examine the effects of the amino acid changes on the susceptibility to GC376, we generated the recombinant 3CLpro carrying the amino acid changes and determined the changes in their susceptibility to GC376 and NPI52 in the FRET assay (Figs. 2 and 3). Among single (N25S, A252S or K260 N), double (N25S + K260 N) or triple (N25S + A252S + K260 N) amino acid changes, only those containing N25S led to a statistically significant reduction in susceptibility to GC376, but the reduction was marginal (up to a 1.68-fold increase in IC 50 compared to that of WT) (Fig. 3A) . Interestingly, A252S or K260 N single mutations did not change the susceptibility of 3CLpro to GC376, nor did further potentiate the effect of N25S in 3CLpro in the FRET assay (Fig. 3A) . Considering the fact that the plasma drug concentrations of GC376 are 205\u02dc834-fold over the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) in cats receiving the drug (Kim et al., 2016) , this result, combined with the previous finding of observed difficulty of raising drug resistance viruses in cell culture, may help explain the absence of clinical drug resistance in the patients that received treatment for an extended period in the field trial.",
