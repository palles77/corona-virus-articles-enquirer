Here, we demonstrate that FEZ1 directly interacts with the HIV-1 capsid and specifically binds capsid protein (CA) hexamers. FEZ1 contains multiple acidic, poly-glutamate stretches that interact with the positively charged central pore of CA hexamers. The FEZ1-capsid interaction directly competes with nucleotides and inositol hexaphosphate (IP6) that bind at the same location. In addition, all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulations establish the molecular details of FEZ1-capsid interactions. Functionally, mutation of the FEZ1 capsid-interacting residues significantly reduces trafficking of HIV-1 particles toward the nucleus and early infection. These findings support a model in which the central capsid hexamer pore is a general HIV-1 cofactor-binding hub and FEZ1 serves as a unique CA hexamer pattern sensor to recognize this site and promote capsid trafficking in the cell.",

After entering a host cell, the capsid must reach the nuclear periphery, where the reverse transcribed viral DNA genome can be delivered into the nucleus for integration into the host genome. Because the capsid is too large to diffuse freely within the crowded cytoplasm environment, active transport along the microtubule network is required for capsid trafficking (Luby-Phelps, 2000) . To accomplish the latter, HIV-1 and several other viruses hijack both kinesin and dynein motors to achieve net retrograde movement, even though kinesin motors move toward the cell periphery . While counterintuitive, this bidirectional transport is a common mechanism in cellular cargo trafficking and enables efficient movement through the crowded cytoplasm (M\u20ac uller et al., 2008; Welte, 2010) . In addition, HIV-1 can stimulate the formation of a stable subset of microtubules that have long halflives and higher affinities for kinesins, making them ideal for long-range cytoplasmic movement of cargos and viruses that exploit kinesins for retrograde movement (Fernandez et al., 2015; Malikov et al., 2015; Sabo et al., 2013) .",

Microtubule stability and capsid transport are tightly connected with controlled capsid disassembly (termed uncoating). Uncoating is finely tuned to the viral life cycle, because the viral genome must initially remain protected by the capsid and later exit it for integration. Capsid uncoating is delayed and viral infectivity is reduced when interfering with microtubule networks, their motors or associated adaptors, or the regulators of their stability (Arhel et al., 2006; Bukrinskaya et al., 1998; Carnes et al., 2018; Dharan et al., 2017; Lukic et al., 2014; Malikov et al., 2015; McDonald et al., 2002; Pawlica and Berthoux, 2014) . Although poorly understood, it has been suggested that the opposing forces applied by motor proteins and capsid-interacting factors at nuclear pores may contribute to capsid uncoating (Campbell and Hope, 2015; Gaudin et al., 2013) .",

Although several microtubule-associated proteins cosediment with HIV-1 capsid assemblies, the dyneinadaptor protein BICD2 is one of the two microtubule-associated proteins demonstrated to date to directly bind capsid (Carnes et al., 2018; Dharan et al., 2017) . As an adaptor protein, BICD2 can activate dynein-mediated transport while binding cargo, and HIV-1 may hijack this functionality for trafficking toward the nucleus. The other factor, a kinesin-1 adaptor protein, fasciculation and elongation protein zeta 1 (FEZ1), was identified as an important cofactor for early post-entry HIV-1 infection Malikov and Naghavi, 2017) . FEZ1 promotes uncoating and trafficking of incoming viral cores to the nucleus in a kinesin-dependent manner, suggesting that HIV-1 coopts its adaptor function to facilitate early steps of viral infection. FEZ1 from mammalian cell lysates copellets with in vitro assembled capsid assemblies, indicating it may be a key link between capsid and the microtubule network .",

The fullerene cone morphology of the assembled capsid provides numerous unique and repetitive surface patterns that may be targeted by protein and small-molecule cofactors. Many capsid-binding host factors only weakly interact with the capsid protein (CA) monomer (Bhattacharya et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016) . Instead, these host factors only recognize surfaces found in assembled capsids, which are built from 1,000 to 1,500 CA molecules. In the capsid, CA is arranged primarily as hexamer subunits, with 12 pentamer subunits necessary for capsid closure (Ganser et al., 1999; Li et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2013) . The 2-and 3-fold symmetric interfaces between hexamers, as well as intra-hexamer surfaces, provide unique binding sites for host factors (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2008; Li et al., 2000) . Because of the redundant nature of the capsid lattice, as well as numerous practical challenges when using assembled capsids (such as their heterogeneity and insolubility), it has been difficult to decipher the diverse capsid-binding modes of host factors.",

Using soluble CA oligomers that capture various partial hexamer architectures , we show that FEZ1 specifically binds CA hexamers. We demonstrate that FEZ1 contains multiple hexamer-sensing motifs consisting of acidic, poly-glutamate stretches that bind at the highly conserved, positively charged hexamer central pore. Our all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulations provide details of this FEZ1-CA interaction. In addition, point mutations of the hexamer-binding FEZ1 sequence severely reduced retrograde viral trafficking and infectivity. The FEZ1-CA hexamer interaction directly competed with binding by deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and inositol hexaphosphate (IP6)-two small-molecule viral cofactors that bind in the same hexamer location (Dick et al., 2018; Jacques et al., 2016; Mallery et al., 2018) . These findings support the notion that the central hexamer pore is a common cofactor-binding site for both proteins and small molecules. FEZ1 is a unique high-affinity CA hexamer pattern sensor, specifically targeting this site to form a bridge between capsid and kinesin motors to regulate HIV-1 intra-cellular trafficking and uncoating.",

We recombinantly expressed full-length FEZ1 (FEZ1 1-392 ) and a series of FEZ1 truncation constructs in Escherichia coli and purified them to homogeneity ( Figure S1A ). We tested these FEZ1 constructs for their ability to copellet with in vitro assembled disulfide-crosslinked CA tubes, because these are well established to mimic the HIV-1 capsid lattice . The full-length protein, FEZ1 1-392 , demonstrated strong CA tube copelleting under physiological ionic strength conditions (150 mM NaCl) ( Figure 1B ). Furthermore, we identified a truncated construct, FEZ1 , which binds CA tubes equally well. In contrast, FEZ1 N-and C-terminal portions outside of this region did not show measurable copelleting under the same conditions ( Figure 1B) . These results demonstrate a direct interaction between FEZ1 and capsid that is not mediated by additional cellular factors. This lends support to a direct linkage between HIV-1 capsid and kinesin-mediated cytoskeleton trafficking.",

We primarily used the FEZ1 92-198 construct because of its superior expression and solution behavior compared with full-length FEZ1. For CA assemblies, we first tested the established native CA monomers-dimers and disulfide-stabilized CA pentamers and hexamers (Pornillos et al., 2010; Pornillos et al., 2011) . In addition, we developed an extensive library of stabilized CA oligomers that recapitulate the unique intra-and inter-hexamer surfaces found in the assembled capsid lattice . These new CA oligomers include a series of partial-hexamer assemblies, which subdivide the CA hexamer into smaller fragments, such as 1/3-and 1/2-hexamers. 1/3-and 1/2-hexamers contain two and three disulfide-linked CA monomers, respectively, arranged with 6-fold rotations just as they are in complete hexamers. 1/2-hexamer assemblies are discrete in solution but have the ability to dimerize into complete hexamers in certain conditions. This hexamer formation can be prevented by the addition of A42E/ T54E mutations at exposed intra-hexamer surfaces (termed 1/2-hexamer-EE). Furthermore, we engineered a new CA hexamer that contains six CA molecules arranged as a trimer of dimers. This structure contains the 3-fold inter-hexamer interface and is stabilized by a fusion to the naturally trimeric bacteriophage T4 foldon domain (termed hexamer-2 foldon ).",

Similarly, we observed no coelution between FEZ1 92-198 and either 1/3-hexamers or 1/2-hexamers that contained hexamerpreventing mutations ( Figures 1D and 1E ). In contrast, we consistently observed complete coelution between FEZ1 92-198 and CA hexamers ( Figure 1G ). A lack of interaction with CA dimers or partial hexamers, despite strong recognition of hexamers, demonstrates a novel FEZ1 capsid-lattice-sensing ability. We also detected strong FEZ1 92-198 coelution with the 1/2-hexamer assembly that is competent to dimerize into a hexamer. The observed elution profile closely resembles that of the hexamer-FEZ1 complex, suggesting that FEZ1 is able to bridge two 1/2hexamers into a hexamer ( Figure 1F ). These data reinforce the idea that FEZ1 targets a complete CA hexamer. In addition, FEZ1 does not appear to require inter-hexamer surfaces for binding, because no coelution was observed with hexamer-2 foldon , which contains native 2-and 3-fold inter-hexamer interfaces (Figure 1H) . Despite their structural similarity to hexamers, we observed no FEZ1 coelution with CA pentamers ( Figure S2 ). These data demonstrate that FEZ1 targets a highly specific surface pattern only found in complete hexamers. A binding mode of this nature has not been described for other capsid-binding proteins.",

There is no elution shift of the mixture (solid purple) relative to the individual components (dotted lines). FEZ1 92-198 does coelute with the CA hexamer (G), and restoration of a hexamer from two 1/2-hexamers (cyan and pink cartoons) restores FEZ1 92-198 coelution (F), which coelutes at the same position as with CA hexamers. In contrast, FEZ1 does not coelute with hexamer-2 foldon (purple cartoon), which also contains 6 CA subunits but arranged around the 3-fold capsid interface (H). See also Figure S2 . FEZ1 CA-hexamer interaction ( Figure 2E ). Subsequent mapping identified the highly negatively charged FEZ1 178-188 region ( 178 SPDPEEEEEVL 188 ) to be the minimal construct that retained strong interaction with CA hexamers ( Figure S1B ).",

However, it is only applicable to relatively stable complexes with binding affinity (dissociation constant [K D ]) at the nanomolar or low micromolar range. To quantify the interaction, we used isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to directly measure the thermodynamic properties of the FEZ1 CA hexamer association. The binding of FEZ1 92-198 with CA hexamers is endothermic with a K D of 300 \u00b1 60 nM (Figures 2F and 2G) . This binding affinity is at least an order of magnitude higher than previously analyzed capsid-binding proteins such as CypA, TRIM5a, TRIMCyp, CPSF6, and Nup153 (Bhattacharya et al., 2014; Biris et al., 2012; Price et al., 2014; Yoo et al., 1997; Zhou et al., 2015) , making FEZ1 the strongest CA hexamer binder known to date. The hexamer-binding affinity of the FEZ1 92-198 182EA mutant was reduced by approximately an order of magnitude (2.5 mM), highlighting the importance of the polyglutamate peptide sequence ( Figures 2F and 2H ). The binding stoichiometry was measured at slightly over one CA hexamer to FEZ1 (n = 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 for FEZ1 92-198 and n = 1.6 \u00b1 0.2 for FEZ1 92-198 182EA ), partly because of the existence of multiple CA hexamer-binding sites within FEZ1 (one major and multiple additional weak sites, described later). When the minimal FEZ1 178-188 construct containing the major CA hexamer-binding site is used, a comparable affinity was observed (K D = 180 \u00b1 40 nM), with a 1:1 CA hexamer to FEZ1 178-188 stoichiometry (n = 1.0 \u00b1 0.2) ( Figures 2F and 2I ).",

We investigated the importance of this highly positively charged region by mutating R18 to an oppositely charged residue (R18D) ( Figures 3B and S3A ). To verify that the R18D mutation does not affect the conformation of the CA hexamer, we determined the crystal structure of the R18D CA hexamer at 2.1 \u00c5 resolution. Structural comparison between R18D and wild-type (WT) CA hexamers reveals minimal structural changes as measured by the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of $0.5 \u00c5 for all six Table S1 ).

In both SEC coelution assays and CA tube copelleting assays, the R18D mutation substantially reduced FEZ1 binding ( Figures 3C and 3D ). To confirm that the loss of FEZ1 binding does not result from destabilization of the R18D hexamer by negative charge repulsion at the R18D center pore, we tested FEZ1 binding to the neutral mutant R18A CA tubes. A similar reduction in FEZ1 binding was observed with the conservative R18A CA mutation ( Figure S5 ), supporting direct binding at the R18 site rather than an indirect destabilization effect by R18D. To determine whether FEZ1 uses other established host factor-binding sites on capsid, we tested FEZ1-CA tube copelleting with various capsid mutations known to reduce capsid recognition by the host protein CypA (G89V and P90A) and the restriction factor MxB (P207S, G208R, and T210K) ( Figure S4B ) (Busnadiego et al., 2014; Gamble et al., 1996; Goujon et al., 2013; Kane et al., 2013; Matreyek et al., 2014) . None of the aforementioned mutations reduced the FEZ1-CA tube interaction ( Figure S4B ).

We tested whether the pH-dependent open and closed b-hairpin conformations affect FEZ1 binding by carrying out binding assays at pH 6, 7, and 8. The results showed that in all three conditions, FEZ1 was able to interact with the CA tubes at a similar level ( Figure S7 ). This is likely because of the dynamic nature of the CA b-hairpin and the conformational flexibility of FEZ1, which is predicted to be unstructured in its unbound form. It is conceivable that the binding energy of FEZ1 enables a shift in the equilibrium toward the open conformation of the CA b-hairpin so that FEZ1 is able to reach into the R18 pore for a stable interaction. This hypothesis is supported by our MD simulation shown later, demonstrating FEZ1's ability to access the hexamer center pore.",

To support our hypothesis that FEZ1 binds in this region of the CA hexamer, we performed competition assays using ATP, dNTPs, or IP6 to compete with FEZ1 for CA tube copelleting ( Figures 3E and S4C ). As expected, the addition of nucleotides or IP6 reduced FEZ1-CA tube interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. These data substantiate FEZ1 as the first protein known to bind to the same conserved, highly positively charged hexamer center targeted by important smallmolecule cofactors.",

This effect at a low ATP/IP6 concentration supports that the loss of binding is a consequence of direct competition at the hexamer center where these cofactors interact, rather than an indirect charge screening effect of these charged molecules at high concentrations.",

            "text": "It may appear intriguing that full-length FEZ1 required higher nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) or IP6 concentrations to abolish binding to CA tubes than that needed for FEZ1 [178] [179] [180] [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] [186] [187] [188] ; the latter showed high-affinity binding to CA hexamers similar to longer FEZ1 constructs ( Figures 2F, 2G, and 2I) . These data suggest that FEZ1 contains multiple CA hexamer-interacting regions. In our SEC and ITC assays using the CA hexamer as the binding partner, which has a single targeting site, the minimal FEZ1 178-188 interacted as effectively as the longer constructs. In contrast, when using CA tubes that contain many hexamer-targeting sites, the simultaneous binding by multiple regions in full-length FEZ1 allows a stronger interaction through the avidity effect. The FEZ1 sequence contains numerous highly negatively charged patches throughout the molecule (Figure 2A ). Our data demonstrated efficient CA tube binding by FEZ1 (Figure 1B) , which likely contains multiple interaction sites, in addition to the strong binding region in FEZ1 178-188 . Although the N-and C-terminal regions (FEZ1 1-92 and FEZ1 98-198 ) did not bind CA tubes under the conditions tested (150 mM NaCl) ( Figure 1B) , the abundance of negatively charged segments in these regions indicates that they potentially contain weaker auxiliary binding sites.",

Even at a low-salt condition of 50 mM NaCl, FEZ1 1-92 and FEZ1 198-392 did not coelute with CA hexamers in SEC-binding assays (Figures 4A and 4B) . However, they efficiently copelleted with CA tubes under this condition ( Figure 4C ). These data show that the individual interactions in these auxiliary regions are weak but multiple interactions allowed avid binding to CA tubes. We confirmed that these sites also interact with CA hexamers at the R18 location, because the CA R18D mutation abolished or severely abrogated binding by all FEZ1 constructs ( Figure 4C) . A binding mode of this nature is supported by the salt dependence of CA tube binding by FEZ1 constructs ( Figures 4E and 4F) . A longer construct with more capsid-interacting stretches, FEZ1 92-227 , was able to retain binding in the presence of higher salt concentrations compared with a shorter construct with fewer binding stretches, FEZ1 92-158 . These results support a model in which primary hexamer-targeting motifs in FEZ1 (FEZ1 ) drive FEZ1-capsid interaction through avidity, with auxiliary binding provided by additional FEZ1 acidic stretches ( Figure 4D ).",

To investigate the interaction of FEZ1 with the CA hexamer, we built an all-atom model and set up a canonical 2-ms-long MD simulation. To prevent model bias by the initial simulation setup, the FEZ1 178-188 peptide was initially placed outside of the CA hexameric pore more than 24 \u00c5 from R18 ( Figure 5A ). The dynamic b-hairpin structure (Jacques et al., 2016) and the flexibility of the FEZ1 peptide allow FEZ1 to reach down into the center of the R18 ring. During the simulation, the FEZ1 178-188 segment rapidly translocated into the pore at the beginning of the simulation and stably remained inside the hexamer pore. The stability of binding was conferred by interactions between FEZ1 and the R18 residue for the remainder of the simulation ( Figure 5B ; Video S1). This rapid conformational change, followed by a stable conformation, demonstrates strong interactions between FEZ1 178-188 and the CA hexamer. In addition, FEZ1 178-188 was recruited from the exterior of the capsid toward the interior cavity, which shows weak electrostatic shielding provided by solvent, water, and ions.",

Moreover, the stability of these salt bridges was demonstrated by the high-contact occupancies exhibited during the simulation.

Results from our MD simulations suggest that FEZ1 178-188 negatively charged residues strongly bind to the positively charged R18 residue inside the CA hexamer center pore through salt bridges.

To determine the importance of the charged regions during early HIV-1 infection in natural target cells, we first tested the effect of mutations in the hexamer-targeting region FEZ1 178-188. Human microglia CHME3 stably expressing control FLAG alone, FLAG-tagged WT, or FLAG-tagged FEZ1 178-188E/A (full-length FEZ1 that has all glutamates in the region 178-188 mutated to alanine) were selectively depleted for endogenous FEZ1, followed by infection with HIV-1 pseudotyped with the WT envelope and carrying a luciferase reporter gene (Malikov and Naghavi, 2017) . Compared with CHME3 cells expressing exogenous WT FEZ1, HIV-1 infection was moderately impaired in cells expressing FEZ1 1-392 178-188EA ( Figure 6A ). Given the function of FEZ1 as a kinesin-1 adaptor protein that facilitates microtubule-based movement of incoming HIV-1 capsid cores Malikov and Naghavi, 2017) , we then tested whether these effects on early infection reflected defects in the transport of incoming viral particles to the nucleus. To do so, CHME3 cells depleted for endogenous FEZ1 and expressing exogenous forms of WT or mutant FEZ1, as described earlier, were infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped with WT envelope and whose core was labeled using GFP-tagged Vpr. These cells were then imaged by live cell microscopy. Rapid, long-range, bi-directional movement of HIV-1 particles was observed in cells expressing exogenous WT FEZ1, and the motility of HIV-1 particles was not significantly affected in CHME3 cells expressing FEZ1 1-392 178-188EA ( Figure 6C ; Video S2). It is somewhat surprising that mutation of this major CA hexamer-targeting region of FEZ1 did not show a detectable trafficking defect. This is possibly because the many secondary binding sites in FEZ1 1-392 178-188EA collectively still allow avid binding of HIV-1 capsid and the reduction (not major loss) in binding was below the threshold of detection in our trafficking measurements.",

We tested the effect of FEZ1 158-198E/A expression on the early infection and transport of incoming HIV-1 particles in cells depleted for endogenous FEZ1. HIV-1 infection was significantly reduced in CHME3 cells expressing FEZ1 158-198E/A ( Figure 6B ). Moreover, FEZ1 158-198E/A expression in CHME3 cells failed to rescue HIV-1 transport to the nucleus, indicating that the motility of incoming HIV-1 particles was significantly reduced ( Figure 6D ; Video S2). Imaging was conducted after spinoculation-based infection, and after time taken to set acquisition locations, the times shown in the figure indicate the period of imaging beginning 20 min post-infection.

FEZ1 1-392 158-198EA cells, a significant number of particles are already trafficking in the cytosol and approaching the nucleus. Moreover, as infection progresses, the number of particles in control and FEZ1 cells decreases because of movement out of the focal plane and/or uncoating. To confirm that the defect in early transport reflected impairment in microtubule motor activity, cells were treated and infected as described earlier but imaged at a higher frame rate of 1 frame per second (fps) over a 300 s period, followed by measurements of distances traveled by viral particles in either retrograde or anterograde directions .",

However, unlike several other viruses, evidence for direct engagement of HIV-1 with microtubule motors is lacking. From studies of FEZ1 and BICD2, it is becoming evident that HIV-1 engages motors indirectly through these kinesin-1 and dynein adaptors, respectively. Outside the context of infection, FEZ1 is known to act as a kinesin-1 adaptor protein that regulates kinesin-1 activity and links it to cargos to transport vesicles and organelles along microtubules in neurons (Blasius et al., 2007; Bloom and Horvitz, 1997; Chua et al., 2012; Kuroda et al., 1999; Toda et al., 2008) . It is reported that FEZ1 interacts with the tail of kinesin-1 heavy chain using its C-terminal coiled-coil region 231-308 (Blasius et al., 2007) . However, although it was shown that FEZ1 binds in vitro assembled CA-NC complexes and promotes early HIV-1 trafficking to the nucleus (Malikov and Naghavi, 2017; Malikov et al., 2015) , the structural basis by which HIV-1 capsids engage motor adaptors remains poorly defined. It was not known whether FEZ1 directly interacts with HIV-1 capsid and, if it does so, which molecular determinants drive the interaction.",

Although the interaction is driven by electrostatic contacts with multiple charged stretches on FEZ1, the recognition of CA hexamers appears to be highly specific, because no binding was detected with CA pentamers that contain similar charge characters ( Figure S2 ). Consistent with FEZ1's role in early viral transport, we found that FEZ1 mutations that abolish its interaction with CA tubes greatly reduced both accumulation of virus particles around the nucleus and HIV-1 infectivity. These results establish a solid link between FEZ1 and intracellular trafficking of HIV-1, substantiating its roles as an adaptor bridging viral capsid and kinesin-1 ( Figure 7A ).",

Although FEZ1 contains a reasonably high-affinity CA hexamer-interacting site (FEZ1 178-188 ), the electrostatic nature of the interaction does not sustain the ionic strength conditions and the direct competition from high concentrations of dNTPs/NTPs and IP6 molecules in cells. HIV-1 solves this problem by using the repeating nature of the capsid lattice to interact simultaneously with numerous negative patches within FEZ1. This highlights the advantageous capsid-targeting mode employed by many cellular protein factors, in which only relatively weak individual interaction sites need to be developed and the avidity effect increases the overall binding affinity by orders of magnitude (Rudnick and Adams, 2009; Vauquelin and Charlton, 2013) . Furthermore, targeting multiple sites enables a capsid pattern-sensing ability that ensures productive binding to the assembled capsid that contains the viral genome.",

The positively charged center of the CA hexamer, generated by residue R18, serves as an ideal interaction site with the highly negatively charged FEZ1 protein. The critical role of the R18 residue has been well documented. When mutated, there are aberrant and fewer capsids, resulting in strikingly reduced HIV-1 infectivity (Forshey et al., 2002; von Schwedler et al., 2003) . This ring of R18 has been indicated to form a pore for the recruitment of nucleotides for reverse transcription inside the capsid (Jacques et al., 2016) and for coordinating the polyanion IP6 to stabilize the capsid (Mallery et al., 2018) . We demonstrate here that this CA hexamer pore can also be targeted by protein cofactors ( Figure 7B ). Our MD simulations show that FEZ1 is able to reach down into this arginine ring in the center of the CA hexamer, possibly because of its inherently flexible and unstructured nature. It is conceivable that other cellular proteins with flexible, negatively charged regions can also bind HIV-1 capsid through this interaction mode.",

The media was changed and acquisition locations were set up within the first 20 min. Timestamps starting at 0 represent the start and period of live-cell video microscopy beginning at 20 min post-infection, performed at 3 frames per min for 2 h. Short interval acquisitions were performed at 1 fps for a period of 300 s as described previously . Number of particles near nuclei were determined using MetaMorph imaging software (Molecular Devices). Up to 190 viral particles were counted per sample, and each experiment consisted of 2-4 cells. One-way ANOVA for correlated samples, with a confidence interval of 95% or greater was used to determine statistical significance in at least two independent experiments for each condition. Single virus particles were tracked in the TrackMate ImageJ plugin v2.8.1 (Tinevez et al., 2017) using estimated blob diameter 8.0 pixels, threshold 100 and frame to frame linking max distance 30 pixels. XML trace files were analyzed using Python 3.7.0 Jupyter notebooks (5.6.0) with Pandas (0.23.4) and Matplotlib (2.2.3) packages. In 3 independent experiments 1600-2800 tracks in 9-13 cells were analyzed per each condition. Equal-variances t test was used to determine statistical significances between datasets.

The CA and FEZ1 protein were fixed at the first 10,000 steps of minimization, while the water molecules and ions were free to move. In the second minimizing stage, the fixed atoms were relieved but the heavy atoms of the proteins were restrained by a force constant of 10 Kcal/mol \u00c5 2 for another 10,000 steps. The minimized model was then thermalized to 310 K with a rate of 1,000 steps/K while the harmonic restraints on protein heavy atoms were maintained. Next, these harmonic restraints on the heavy atoms were gradually released during a 100,000 equilibration run under 310 K and 1 bar.
