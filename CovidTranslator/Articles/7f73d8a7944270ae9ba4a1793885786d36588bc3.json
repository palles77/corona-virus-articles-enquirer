            "text": "Governments around the world are responding to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic 1 with unprecedented policies designed to slow the growth rate of infections. Many actions, such as closing schools and restricting populations to their homes, impose large and visible costs on society. In contrast, the benefits of these policies, in the form of infections that did not occur, cannot be directly observed and are currently understood through process-based simulations. [2][3][4] Here, we compile new data on 936 local, regional, and national anti-contagion policies recently deployed in the ongoing pandemic across localities in China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, France, and the United States (US). We then apply reduced-form econometric methods, commonly used to measure the effect of policies on economic growth, to empirically evaluate the effect that these anti-contagion policies have had on the growth rate of infections. In the absence of any policy actions, we estimate that early infections of COVID-19 exhibit exponential growth rates of roughly 45% per day. We find that anti-contagion policies collectively have had significant effects slowing this growth, although policy actions in the US appear to be too recent to have a substantial impact since the magnitude of these effects grows over time. Our results suggest that similar policies may have different impacts on different populations, but we obtain consistent evidence that the policy packages now deployed are achieving large and beneficial health outcomes. We estimate that, to date, current policies have already prevented or delayed on the order of eighty-million infections. These findings may help inform whether or when ongoing policies should be lifted or intensified, and they can support decision-making in the over 150 countries where COVID-19 has been detected but not yet achieved high infection rates. 5 2 .

After containment of the initial outbreak failed, attention turned to implementing large-scale social policies designed to slow contagion of the virus, 6 with the ultimate goal of slowing the rate at which life-threatening cases emerge so as to not exceed the capacity of existing medical systems. In general, these policies aim to decrease opportunities for virus transmission by reducing contact among individuals within or between populations, such as by closing schools, limiting gatherings, and restricting mobility. Such actions are not expected to halt contagion completely, but instead are meant to slow the spread of COVID-19 to a manageable rate. These large-scale policies are developed using epidemiological simulations 2, 4, 7-17 and a small number of natural experiments in past epidemics. 18 However, the actual impacts of these policies on infection rates in the ongoing pandemic are unknown. Because the modern world has never experienced a pandemic from this pathogen, nor deployed anti-contagion policies of such scale and scope, it is crucial that direct measurements of policy impacts be used alongside numerical simulations in current decision-making.",

For example, restrictions imposed on businesses are increasing unemployment, 19 travel bans are bankrupting airlines, 20 and school closures may have enduring impacts on affected students. 21 It is therefore not surprising that some populations hesitate before implementing such dramatic policies, particularly when these costs are visible while their health benefits -infections and deaths that would have occurred but instead were avoided or delayed -are unseen. Our objective is to measure this direct benefit; specifically, how much these policies slowed the growth rate of infections. We treat recently implemented policies as hundreds of different natural experiments proceeding in parallel. Our hope is to learn from the recent experience of six countries where the virus has advanced enough to trigger largescale policy actions, in part so that societies and decision-makers in the remaining 180+ countries can access this information immediately.",

We compile publicly available sub-national data on daily infection rates and the timing of policy deployments, including (1) travel restrictions, (2) social distancing through cancellation of events and suspensions of educational/commercial/religious activities, (3) quarantines and lockdowns, and (4) additional policies such as emergency declarations or expansions of paid sick leave, from the earliest available dates to the present (March 18, 2020; see complete descriptions in the Appendix). Because the pandemic is still in its early stages, populations in these countries remain almost entirely susceptible to COVID-19, causing the natural spread of infections 3 to exhibit almost perfect exponential growth. 7, 14, 22 The rate of this exponential growth may change daily and is determined by epidemiological factors, such as disease infectivity and contact networks, as well as policies that induce behavior changes. 7, 8, 22 We cannot experimentally manipulate policies ourselves, but because they are being deployed while the epidemic unfolds, we can measure their impact empirically. We examine how the growth rate of infections each day in a given locality changes in response to the collection of ongoing policies applied to that locality on that day.",

Similarly to early COVID-19 infections, economic output generally increases exponentially with a variable rate that can be affected by policy or other conditions. Unlike process-based epidemiological models, 7-9, 12, 22, 29, 30 the reduced-form statistical approach to inference that we apply does not require explicit prior information about fundamental epidemiological parameters or mechanisms, many of which remain unknown in the current pandemic. Rather, the collective influence of these factors is empirically recovered from the data without modeling their individual effects explicitly (see Methods). Prior work on influenza, 31 for example, has shown that such statistical approaches can provide important complementary information to process-based models.",

We then employ widely-used panel regression models 23, 24 to estimate how the daily growth rate of infections changes over time within a location when different combinations of large-scale social policies are enacted (see Methods). Our econometric approach accounts for differences in the baseline growth rate of infections across locations due to differences in demographics, socio-economic status, culture, or health systems across localities within a country; it accounts for systemic patterns in growth rates within countries unrelated to policy, such as the effect of the work-week; it is robust to systematic under-surveillance; and it accounts for changes in procedures to diagnose positive cases (see Methods and Appendix Section 2). The reduced-form statistical techniques we use are designed to measure the total magnitude of the effect of changes in policy, without attempting to explain the origin of baseline growth rates or the specific epidemiological mechanisms linking policy changes to infection growth rates (see Methods). Thus, this approach does not provide the important mechanistic insights generated by process-based models; however, it does effectively quantify the key policyrelevant relationships of interest using recent real-world data when fundamental epidemiological parameters are still uncertain.",

Country-specific estimates range from 25.23% per day (p< 0.05) in China to 65.04% per day (p< 0.001) in Iran, although an estimate only using data from Wuhan, the only Chinese city where a meaningful quantity of pre-policy data is available, is 55% per day (p< 0.001). Growth rates in South Korea, Italy, France, and the US are very near the 45% average value (Figure 2A ). These estimated values differ from the observed growth rates because the latter are confounded by the effects of policy. In the early stages of most epidemics, a large proportion of the population remains susceptible to the virus, and if the spread of the virus is left uninhibited by policy or behavioral change, exponential growth will continue until the fraction of the susceptible population declines meaningfully. 7, 29 This decline results from members of the population leaving the transmission cycle, due to either recovery or death. 29 At the time of writing, the minimum susceptible population fraction in any of the administrative units analyzed is 99.4% of the total population (Lodi, Italy: 1,445 infections in a population of 230,000). This suggests that all administrative units in all six countries would likely be in a regime of uninhibited exponential growth if policies were removed today.",

In general, the estimated total effects of policy packages are large enough that they can in principle offset a large fraction of, or even eliminate, the baseline growth rate of infections-although in several countries many localities are not currently deploying the full set of policies. Our estimate for the total growth effect of all US policies is quantitatively substantial (-0.25) but not statistically significant. US estimates are highly uncertain due to the short period of time for which data are available and because the time elapsed since these actions may be too short to observe a significant impact. In China, where policies have been enacted for over seven weeks, we observe that policy impacts have grown over time during the first three weeks of deployment (-0.11 to -0.33) .

Estimated effects differ between countries, and policies are neither identical nor perfectly comparable in their implementation across countries or, in many cases, across different localities within the same country.

Also in China, we omit day-of-week effects because there is no evidence to suggest they are present in the data -this could be due to the fact that the outbreak of COVID-19 began during a national holiday and workers never returned to work. In Iran, we estimate a separate effect of policies implemented in Tehran that is allowed to differ from the effect in other locations by creating Tehran-specific dummy variable that is interacted with both policy variables.

The agency defines two categories of contacts: close contacts and routine contacts. The former is defined as a person who has been within two meters of, in the same room as, or exposed to any respiratory secretions of an infected individual. The latter refers to whether the individual conducted any activity in the same place and time as the infected person. Prior to this regime change, KCDC separated those two cases and applied different quarantine policies; starting February 4, 2020, any routine contacts were also required to be self-quarantined. 43 Shortly thereafter, South Korea aggressively expanded the scope of their testing. Starting February 7, 2020, the KCDC broadened the definition of suspected cases to 1) anyone who developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days after returning from China, 2) anyone who developed a fever or respiratory symptoms within 14 days after being in close contact with a confirmed case, and 3) anyone suspected of contracting COVID-19 based on their travel history to affected countries and their clinical symptoms.

Their press release stated: \"Suspected cases with a medical professional's recommendation, regardless of travel history, will get tested. Additionally, those who are hospitalized with unknown pneumonia will also be tested.

This method involves avoiding crowds, staying home, limiting or avoiding visiting vulnerable populations (such as long-term care facilities) and standing at least six feet away from others in public spaces. Some regions have implemented school closures at both the K-12 and higher education level. Business closures have also been recommended or enforced, such that employees should work from home, unless their work is considered essential to the greater public (e.g. health care, grocery stores).

The left-hand-side plots show cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 (solid black line w. squares) and deaths attributed to the disease (dashed black line) over time (left axes). Deployment of anti-contagion policies are indicated by vertical lines, with height corresponding to the number of administrative units that instituted the policy on a given day (right axes). For display purposes, not all policies are shown for each country; we highlight up to five policy types in each country, giving priority to those that were enacted in the most administrative units (see SI for all policies). The right-hand-side maps show the number of confirmed cases by administrative unit, as ofMarch 18, 2020. The area of each circle scales with the number of cases. Country-specific longitudinal data are at the region level in France, the state level in the US, the province level in South Korea, Italy, and Iran, and the city level in China. For China, there are some discrepancies between the administrative units used in the epidemiological data and the official administrative units that the map is based on. We use the former in our analysis, but display the administrative units common to both data sets here.",

These estimates describe the combined impact of all policies deployed in a country, for a locality where policies are fully utilized and affect the entire population. Weekly impacts in China are the week-by-week impact for the same set of policies which remained deployed for multiple weeks. Results are marginally statistically significant for France (p< 0.09).
