Soon, the pathogenic virus was proven to be a novel coronavirus , which shares 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV (Zhou et al. 2020a) . A total of 81,498 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 3,267 deaths (4.0%) had been reported in China by March 22, 2020; meanwhile, 210,644 laboratory-confirmed cases and 9,517 deaths (4.5%) were reported outside China (WHO 2020) . Common symptoms of COVID-19 infection include fever, fatigue and dry cough. Some patients would experience severe complications, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), arrhythmia and shock ). According to a research, the mean incubation period is 3.0 days (Guan et al. 2020) . Obviously, the COVID-19 epidemic can spread rapidly by human-to-human transmission, but the exact epidemiological characteristics and the specific modes of transmission remain partially unknown. The basic reproduction number (R0) was used to evaluate the transmission ability of COVID-19. Riou et al estimated that the R0 of COVID-19 in January was about 2.2, suggesting the possibility for continuous human-to-human transmission (Riou and Althaus 2020) . Zhou et al obtained similar results with R0 between 2.8 and 3.3 (Zhou et al. 2020b ). Lipsitch et al.",

The transmission capacity of COVID-19 appeared to be similar or higher compared to SARS-CoV. As a continuous unconventional public health event that can lead to economic recession and health damage, it is of great importance to timely estimate the epidemic stage of the outbreak and determine whether it is possible to return to normal work and life. Faced with such a sudden outbreak of new infectious diseases, we have no history to learn from and no evidence to count on. The traditional epidemic prediction models, including SEIR, are highly sensitive to the pre-specified epidemiological parameters, and the prediction results may be highly inconsistent due to different assumptions and data sources. The reliability of the SEIR model can be affected by many factors that are difficult to estimate, including seasonality of coronavirus, inter-city mobility, transmission of travel behavior, and the number of asymptomatic infections. The model may underestimate the scale of the outbreak (Wu et al. 2020) . Traditional models prove to be most reliable only under ideal conditions.",

The median time from the onset of symptom to hospital admission was 7.0 days , and it should become shorter due to the deeper public awareness of the disease. According to NHC, the average time from onset to diagnosis is 4.95 days by February 17, 2020, so the number of new cases per day cannot accurately account for the epidemic situation. The choice of LMA duration can be changed based on the dynamics of the epidemic. Here, we mainly used the 7-day LMA, which can better cover both the incubation period and the duration from the first symptoms to diagnosis. Other MAs (5-day, 10-day and 14-day) were used for sensitivity analysis and auxiliary display was performed in the appendix.",

It's time to plan to phase out some stringent preventive and control measures. If the EEI remains below 1.0 for more than 7 days (one time interval of LMA), it indicates that the epidemic has entered a stable remission period. It is possible to phase out highly stringent restrictions and then resume production gradually.. If the upper limit of the EEI is less than 1, indicating that under the worst circumstance, the EEI is also at a low level. It can be said with greater confidence that the epidemic will soon be completely eliminated. If there are very few daily new confirmed cases (<5), the EEI will become not applicable.

During the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese government learned lessons from the experience of SARS epidemic and adopted emergency measures related to population prevention and clinical treatment after the outbreak.

As can be seen from figure 2A, 2B, 3A and 3B, the peak of daily new laboratory-confirmed cases in mainland China and Hubei province were on February 9, approximately 14 days (one quarantine observation period) after the public health emergency response, which indicates that the public health measures proved to be effective. The peak in other provinces appeared earlier, approximately on February 5. The possible reason is that the epidemic outside Hubei Province is less serious and easier to control. We can see that the first-grade prevention policy (on January 20) hadn't been carried out until 20 days after the outbreak (on Dec 31). After the SARS epidemic in 2003, Chinas public health system has received attention, but problems that emerged during the initial stage of the COVID-19 epidemic indicated that it still lacks the ability to respond quickly to unexpected infectious diseases and public health emergencies. There is still much room for improvement in the prevention and control system for major public health emergencies (Ding et al. 2020 ).",

The 14-day MA curve appears to be the most stable curve and the 5-day MA curve is the most unstable one. We can use MA of different time intervals to evaluate trends based on the current public health strategy and the urban traffic situation at different stages. Regardless of the time interval of MA, the peak of the epidemic in provinces outside Hubei always appears earlier than that in Hubei Province, which is consistent with our conclusion based on 7-day LMA.",
