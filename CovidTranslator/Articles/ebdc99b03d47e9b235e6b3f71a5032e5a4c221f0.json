            "text": "Ebola virus infection can cause severe hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality in humans. The outbreaks of Ebola viruses in 2014 represented the most serious Ebola epidemics in history and greatly threatened public health worldwide. The development of additional effective anti-Ebola therapeutic agents is therefore quite urgent. In this study, via high throughput screening of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, we identified that teicoplanin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, potently prevents the entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses into the cytoplasm. Furthermore, teicoplanin also has an inhibitory effect on transcription-and replication-competent virus-like particles, with an IC 50 as low as 330 nM. Comparative analysis further demonstrated that teicoplanin is able to block the entry of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) envelope pseudotyped viruses as well. Teicoplanin derivatives such as dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin can also inhibit the entry of Ebola, MERS, and SARS viruses. Mechanistic studies showed that teicoplanin blocks Ebola virus entry by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L, opening a novel avenue for the development of additionalglycopeptidesaspotentialinhibitorsofcathepsinL-dependent viruses. Notably, given that teicoplanin has routinely been used in the clinic with low toxicity, our work provides a promising prospect for the prophylaxis and treatment of Ebola, MERS, and SARS virus infection.",

It has been reported that both Ebola viruses and SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) need to be transported to the endo/lysosomes to release their genomes (Fig. 4A) (18) . Therefore, HIV-luc/SARS-CoV-S pseudotyped viruses that bear the S proteins of SARS-CoVs were generated and used to test whether their entry could be repressed by teicoplanin. The data indicated that teicoplanin also inhibits the entry of SARS-CoVs (Fig. 4B) . Given that Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) represent the cell receptors of Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs, respectively (16, 34, 35) , and that teicoplanin inhibits both of these viruses, it is necessary to clarify whether Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs share cell receptor affinity. Following depletion of the expression of NPC1 and ACE2 in HEK293T cells using siRNAs, the cells were infected with Ebola or SARS-CoV pseudotyped viruses. The results demonstrated that the knockdown of NPC1 affected the infectivity of Ebola but not that of SARS-CoV pseudotyped viruses, whereas the converse was observed following ACE2 knockdown (Fig. 4C ). This indicates that these two viruses are each associated with specific receptors and also excludes the possibility that teicoplanin inhibits the interaction between the viruses and their cell receptors or the events following receptor binding. Taken together, these data led us to hypothesize that the target of teicoplanin would be the host factor(s) which is (are) required for both Ebola and SARS-CoV infection. Considering that interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) represent the first line of anti-viral defense of the cells, we first examined the effect of teicoplanin on the expression of IFITMs. However, the data showed that teicoplanin did not induce the expression of IFITMs (data not shown).",

            "text": "Teicoplanin Has No Effect on HOPS Complexes-We further examined the host factors that are required for both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs but not VSVs using siRNAs. Through genome-wide haploid genetic screening, several host factors essential for Ebola viral infection have been identified (16) . Accordingly, we infected cells with Ebola-, SARS-CoV-, or VSV-pseudotyped HIV-1 viruses after siRNA-mediated knockdown of the expression of 13 individual host factors. We found that cathepsin L (CTSL), VPS11, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39, and VPS41 are required for both Ebola and SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 5B ) rather than VSV infection. These results imply that the host factors might be the targets of teicoplanin. VPS11, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39, and VPS41 are components of HOPS complexes, which mediate the homotypic fusion between late endosomes and the heterotypic fusion between late endosomes and lysosomes (29, 36, 37) . To investigate whether teicoplanin affects the transport of Ebola viruses by inhibiting HOPS complex function and subsequently disturbing endosome maturation and fusion between the late endosomes and the lysosomes, a dextran uptake assay was conducted (Fig. 5C ). We found that within 2 h of uptake, the dextran-Alexa Fluor 568 could be transported into lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)-positive lysosomes. The co-localization coefficient of dextran and LAMP1 was influenced by siRNA knockdown of VPS39 and VPS41, whereas teicoplanin did not exert any effect (Fig. 5D) . These data indicated that teicoplanin does not inhibit the transport of dextran-Alexa Fluor 568. Therefore, it is unlikely that teicoplanin inhibits the entry of Ebola viruses by affecting HOPS complexes. In addition, we conducted virion uptake assays to demonstrate that teicoplanin does not inhibit both Ebola-and VSV-pseudotyped virion uptake at 0.5, 1, and 2 h post-infection (Fig. 5, E and F) . These data indicated that teicoplanin did not affect the endocytosis of Ebola-and VSV- pseudotyped virions, at least the early phase. In addition, these data also indicated that, except HOPS complexes, teicoplanin has no effect on the other host factors that are involved in the process of virion uptake.",

            "text": "Teicoplanin Directly Inhibits the Enzymatic Activity of Cathepsin L-After excluding the possibility that the machinery for vesicle transport is involved in the inhibitory effect of teicoplanin, we assumed that the enzymes in the late endosome/ lysosome could be the target of teicoplanin. The proteolysis of glycoprotein by cathepsin L has been reported to be required for the membrane fusion of both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs (31) . In contract, cathepsin B is required for Ebola virus infection but not SARS-CoV infection (17, 31) . As such, we hypothesized that cathepsin L rather than cathepsin B could be the target for teicoplanin. To this end, we examined whether teicoplanin can inhibit the enzymatic activity of cathepsin L (Fig.  6A) . Two assays to measure the cathepsin L enzymatic activity were performed (30, 31) . We showed that teicoplanin potently inhibits the activity of cathepsin L in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6, B and E) . Considering that the inhibitory dose of teicoplanin on the activity of cathepsin L is higher than that required for Ebola virus infection inhibition, a cell viability assay was performed to confirm that the inhibitory effect is not due to cytotoxicity (Fig. 6C) . In addition, a comparative analysis of the inhibitory dose of teicoplanin and that of previously reported cathepsin L inhibitors, Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)-diazomethyl ketones, on Ebola virus infection was conducted. We demonstrated that both compounds can inhibit Ebola virus infection at low doses. The IC 50 dose of teicoplanin required to inhibit the Ebola entry is approximately four times more than that of Z-Phe-Tyr(t-Bu)diazomethyl ketones (Fig. 6D and Table 2 ). Similarly, the IC 50 dose of teicoplanin required to inhibit the enzymatic activity of cathepsin L was also approximately four times greater (Fig. 6, B and E, and Table 2 ). These data indicated that the high doses of teicoplanin determined to be required for the inhibition of cathepsin L enzymatic activity could be due to the relatively low sensitivity of the cathepsin L activity assay. These data clearly demonstrate the consistency between the inhibition of virus entry and the inhibition of cathepsin L activity and further support our conclusion that the target molecule of teicoplanin is cathepsin L.",

            "text": "Teicoplanin is a glycopeptide antibiotic isolated from Actinoplanes teichomyceticus. Teicoplanin contains five major components (39, 40) that can form complexes with the C-ter- minal L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala subunits of lipid II peptidoglycan precursors. Teicoplanin binding of lipid II inhibits their transglycosylation and transpeptidation, leading to disturbed cell wall synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria (41) . Recently, teicoplanin was reported to inhibit Ebola pseudovirus infection in cell culture, which is consistent with our observations. Teicoplanin was also demonstrated to have an effect on a common component used by both enveloped Ebola viruses and human respiratory syncytial viruses but not by non-enveloped viruses (26) . However, the mechanism by which teicoplanin inhibits the entry of Ebola remained unresolved. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, we compared the entry of Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs and the effect of teicoplanin thereon. Teicoplanin represses the entry of both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs, which require transport to the endo/lysosomes to deliver their genomes. Because several host factors have been reported to be essential for Ebola and SARS-CoV virus infection, the identification of the common host factors that are required for the entry of both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs would likely be helpful to clarify the target of tei- FIGURE 9 . Chemical structures of glycopeptide antibiotics. Teicoplanin, dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin, which inhibit the entry of Ebola trVLPs, MERS-CoVs, and SARS-CoVs, contain key hydrophobic groups. However, vancomycin, which does not exert antiviral activity, does not contain these groups. coplanin. Our data demonstrated that CTSL, VPS11, VPS18, VPS33A, VPS39, and VPS41 are all indispensable for the entry of both Ebola viruses and SARS-CoVs (Fig. 5B) . The elucidation via a dextran uptake assay that teicoplanin does not affect the functions of HOPS complexes suggested that the target of teicoplanin was cathepsin L. In support of this, the results of two cathepsin L enzymatic activity assays indicated that teicoplanin indeed inhibits the activity of cathepsin L, which can explain why teicoplanin inhibited both the entry of Ebola viruses and human respiratory syncytial viruses as shown in a previous study (26) because cathepsin L is required for the infection mechanism of both (17, 42) . Considering that cathepsin L is also required for the entry of MERS-CoVs, teicoplanin thus represents a broad virus entry inhibitor. In addition, the inhibitory effects of teicoplanin and its derivatives on HIV-1, HCV, influenza viruses, flaviviruses, FIPV, and SARS-CoVs have also been reported (43) (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) (49) , further supporting that the antiviral target for glycopeptide antibiotics is a common host factor.",

The specific binding sites of teicoplanin on cathepsin L need to be further investigated by molecular docking, amino acid mutation, and surface plasmon resonance to confirm this hypothesis. We also examined the effects of the teicoplanin homologs dalbavancin, oritavancin, telavancin, and vancomycin on the entry of Ebola trVLPs, MERS-CoV/HIV-1, and SARS-CoV/ HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses. The data demonstrated that dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin also inhibit the entry of MERS-CoV/HIV-1 and SARS-CoV/HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses. However, vancomycin did not repress their infection. By comparing the structures of these compounds, we found that all the glycopeptide antibiotics that inhibit Ebola trVLP, MERS-CoV/HIV-1, and SARS-CoV/HIV-1 pseudotyped virus entry contain hydrophobic groups at the amidogen domains of their aminosaccharides. These groups might play an important role in the interactions between the glycopeptide antibiotics and cathepsin L. In contrast, vancomycin lacks the hydrophobic groups, which might be the reason why it does not inhibit these viral infections (Fig. 9) .",

Compared with vancomycin, which was the first discovered glycopeptide antibiotic, teicoplanin is better tolerated with lower nephrotoxicity (52) . The Summary of Product Characteristics for teicoplanin in 2014 shows that, after the completion of the loading dose regimens for most Gram-positive bacterial infections, the serum concentrations of teicoplanin are at least 15 mg/liter (8.78 M), which is \u03f327, 14, and 2 times higher than the IC 50 values of teicoplanin against the entry of Ebola viruses, MERS-CoV/HIV-1, and SARS-CoV/HIV-1 pseudotyped viruses, respectively. As the toxicity of glycopeptide antibiotics is quite low, we propose that glycopeptide antibiotics might be used in the clinic for Ebola/MERS-CoV/SARS-CoV infection, espe-cially in the case of emergency requirements during outbreaks of these severe viral infections.",
