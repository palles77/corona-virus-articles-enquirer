            "text": "The lymphatic endothelium (LE) serves as a conduit for transport of immune cells and soluble antigens from peripheral tissues to draining lymph nodes (LNs), contributing to development of host immune responses and possibly dissemination of microbes. Lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) are major constituents of the lymphatic endothelium. These specialized cells could play important roles in initiation of host innate immune responses through sensing of pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including tolllike receptors (TLRs). LECs secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines to create local inflammatory conditions for recruitment of na\u00efve antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells (DCs) to sites of infection and/or vaccine administration. In this study, we examined the innate immune potential of primary LEC populations derived from multiple tissues of an animal model for human infectious diseases --the ferret. We generated a total of six primary LEC populations from lung, tracheal, and mesenteric LN tissues from three different ferrets. Standard RT-PCR characterization of these primary LECs showed that they varied in their expression of LEC markers. The ferret LECs were examined for their ability to respond to poly I:C (TLR3 and RIG-1 ligand) and other known TLR ligands as measured by production of proinflammatory cytokine (IFN\u03b1, IL6, IL10, Mx1, and TNF\u03b1) and chemokine (CCL5, CCL20, and CXCL10) mRNAs using real time RT-PCR. Poly I:C exposure induced robust proinflammatory responses by all of the primary ferret LECs. Chemotaxis was performed to determine the functional activity of CCL20 produced by the primary lung LECs and showed that the LEC-derived CCL20 was abundant and functional. Taken together, our results continue to reveal the innate immune",

Since the LE is often located within micrometers beneath mucosal surfaces, they are likely to be among the first cells to participate in early host innate immune responses upon contact with microbes, host inflammatory signals, and vaccine antigens. LECs secrete chemoattractant cytokines (chemokines), such as CCL20, which recruit immature DCs to sites of inflammation, and CCL21, which draws antigen-loaded mature DCs into the collecting lymphatic vessels and then downstream into the LN paracortices, wherein a unique environment is created to optimize activation of adaptive immune responses (Luther et al., 2000; Saeki et al., 1999) .",

TLR activation results in signaling that triggers the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including type I interferons (IFNs), that are crucial not only for pathogen clearance during innate responses, but also enhance the induction of antigen-specific responses during subsequent adaptive immunity (Akira and Takeda, 2004; Beutler, 2009 ). Thus, the use of TLR ligands as vaccine adjuvants to increase vaccine efficacy in inducing host immune responses is an attractive strategy for development of next generation vaccines. Recent studies on the use of TLR ligand-conjugated vaccines have been promising in non-human primates (Kwissa et al., 2012) as well as small animal models such as mice (Zhang and Matlashewski, 2008; Zhu et al., 2010) and ferrets (Fang et al., 2010) . However, different TLR ligand adjuvants mediate distinct cellular and molecular profiles of early innate responses in the periphery and the lymphatic organs of non-human primates (Kwissa et al., 2012) . Despite their potential, there is still limited understanding of the local and systemic immune responses and potential toxicities associated with their use in vivo.",

The use of the ferret as an animal model for studying human respiratory diseases has offered a number of advantages. First, ferret airways resemble and share many anatomical and physiological similarities to humans making them useful for study of human respiratory infections (Bruder et al., 2010) . In addition, ferrets are highly susceptible to a number of human respiratory pathogens that often require no laboratory adaptation prior to infection (Belser et al., 2011; O'Donnell and Subbarao, 2011) . Furthermore, ferrets are considered an accurate small animal model to study both human and avian influenza (Bouvier and Lowen, 2010) . In this regard, the ferret model is used to study not only seasonal and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus pathogenicity, but also viral transmission Russell et al., 2012) and the development of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics (Banner and Kelvin, 2012) .",

Molecular cloning and phylogenetic analysis of ferret immune-related genes provides tools to assess the inflammatory cytokine and chemokine profiles in infected animals and determine their importance in disease progression and/or clearance of infection (Nakata et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2013) . The expression of functional TLRs by human LECs (Pegu et al., 2008) has highlighted that the LE could be a target for new vaccine adjuvancy strategies, alongside monocytes and DCs. In this light, we isolated, cultured, and characterized primary LECs from multiple ferret tissues, and determined their responsiveness to known TLR ligands by measuring the production of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNAs using real time RT-PCR. In addition, we also cloned and sequenced ferret LEC marker partial cDNAs for in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis to probe the lymphatic vasculature in ferret tissues. Altogether, these findings provide insight into the function and microanatomy of ferret lymphatics and establish a foundation for examination of the roles of LECs during infection and immunization.",

Previous analyses of ferret cytokine cDNAs reported that ferret sequences were closely related to canine sequences (Nakata et al., 2008) . Total cellular RNAs were obtained from ferret lung, spleen, and LN tissues, both untreated and stimulated overnight with unmethylated CpG oligonucleotides (ODN), poly I:C, or lipopolysaccharide (LPS).

Total RNA (2 \u00b5g) was reverse transcribed using oligo-dT primer (Promega, Madison, MI, USA) and avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, MI, USA). The resulting cDNAs for each tissue type were pooled and standard RT-PCR was performed using GoTaq DNA Polymerase (Promega, Madison, MI, USA) with ferret-specific primers (Table 2) using PCR conditions as follows: 94\u00b0C for 3 min, 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 58\u00b0C for 30 sec, and 72\u00b0C 2 min for 35 cycles, followed by 72\u00b0C for an additional 10 min before holding at 4\u00b0C.

Sequences were aligned with corresponding sequences from other species as available through the NCBI/GenBank database using the ClustalX 2.1 multiple sequence alignment program (Jeanmougin et al., 1998) .

These studies were driven by the goal of obtaining primary ferret LECs for ex vivo analyses (below) and it was imperative to obtain information on LEC target sequences to allow development of assays for measurement of mRNA levels in the LEC populations. We successfully obtained cDNAs containing full-length (podoplanin and CCL21) or partial (LYVE-1, PROX-1, and VEGFR-3) ORFs from total cellular RNAs prepared from ferret tissues. Sequence homology analysis of each of the ferret LEC markers with other species showed the highest similarity to the order Carnivora, with Canis lupus being the most related species (Table 1) . This corroborated earlier findings with ferret immune-related genes (Nakata et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2013) . Ferret LEC markers shared between 74% to 98% sequence homology to the corresponding human sequences at the nucleotide level and between 60% to 100% sequence homology at the amino acid level. Analysis of the PROX-1 partial ORF showed it is well conserved across multiple species at both the nucleotide (98%) and amino acid (99-100%) levels. Phylogenetic analysis of the podoplanin complete ORF revealed that ferret sequences clustered together with species in the order Carnivora (Figure 1 ).

Responsiveness was measured again by real time RT-PCR. The ferret lung LECs responded strongly to most of the TLR ligands examined (Figure 4) , although this varied depending upon the TLR ligand and the mRNA measured. The gene showing the greatest overall response across TLR ligands was CCL20 (Figure 4 ) with a mean induction (geometric mean) of 5,041-fold across all TLR ligands. In contrast, the mean induction levels for TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b1, and IL-10 were all less than 1.5-fold across all TLR ligands. Analysis of the LEC responses across all genes for the individual TLR ligands revealed that poly I:C was the most potent TLR ligand under these conditions inducing the eight genes examined an average of 2,424-fold (geometric mean). The low molecular weight form of poly I:C induced these genes an average of 288-fold.

Chemically synthesized ferret CCL20 protein was used as a positive control for cell migration and media alone was used as a negative control. Migration of the ferret CCR6+ responder cells to serial dilutions of the synthetic peptide generated the typical bell-shaped, dose-dependent responses ( Figure 5 , right), with maximum migration at 10nM, yielding a chemotactic index (CI) of 393 (with 20,000-30,000 cells typically migrating). Among the TLR ligands examined, the supernatant from the Pam3CSK-treated LECs induced the greatest cell migration with a CI of 169, followed by supernatant from the FSL-1-treated cells (CI of 162), poly I:C-treated cells (CI of 111), flagellin-treated cells (CI of 27), and ssRNA40-treated cells (CI of 30).

In LN, CCL21 mRNA was abundant in the cortical and paracortical regions (not shown) as we (Pegu et al., 2007) and others have observed in other animals models. In jejunum, LYVE-1 ( Figure 6) and CCL21 (not shown) were in the lacteals of villi, which are part of the LV immediately beneath the intestinal epithelium. We also observed networks of LV expressing high levels of CCL21 in the jejunal smooth muscle layer (not shown). In lung tissues, ferret CCL21 mRNA was expressed by widely distributed, small, thin-walled vessels in areas near ( Figure 6 ) and distal to conducting airways. Parallel hybridization of subjacent tissue sections with a sense control riboprobe yielded no specific signal for any of the tissues examined ( Figure 6 ).

Due to lack of ferret-specific or cross-reactive LEC markerspecific antibodies we were unable to enrich primary ferret LECs. Not surprisingly, though, immunosorting of LECs using marker-specific antibodies can contribute to differences observed in the molecular and functional profiles of isolated LECs (Whitehurst et al., 2006) , which could be expected to be heterogeneous in different anatomic and microanatomic compartments. Therefore, it will be important to keep in mind this potential for bias towards enrichment of subpopulations of LECs expressing moderate to high levels of surface antigens (Whitehurst et al., 2006) . On the other hand, cell types other than LECs can express the markers used for enrichment (Wick et al., 2008) , such as with LYVE-1, which is expressed by heterogeneous populations of cells, including subpopulations expressing CD68, CD206, or CD208 (Ogunbiyi et al., 2011) , which in turn could lead to inclusion of non-LECs in the immune-enriched populations obtained and studied. A recent study showed that LECs obtained by digesting pooled brachial, axillary, inguinal, and popliteal LNs from wild-type C57BL/6J mouse and simple bulk culture in the common DMEM medium, yielded LECs that preserved their LEC characteristics over at least 20 passages (Jordan-Williams and Ruddell, 2014).",

Primary human LECs express functional TLRs that sense PAMPs and secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines at peripheral sites for recruitment of APCs to and through the LV (Johnson and Jackson, 2010; Pegu et al., 2008) . However, little is known about primary LECs from other species commonly used as animal models for human diseases. The ferret is an attractive small animal model to study human respiratory viruses, especially influenza virus, due to the unique physiologic and anatomic similarities of its respiratory tract relative to humans (Belser et al., 2011; Bouvier and Lowen, 2010; Geisbert et al., 2010; O'Donnell and Subbarao, 2011 ). The ferret model has been utilized as an animal model to study seasonal and avian influenza virus pathogenesis, as well for vaccine and therapeutic development and studies of viral transmission (Banner and Kelvin, 2012; Herfst et al., 2012; Leon et al., 2013; Russell et al., 2012) . We describe here for the first time the isolation of primary ferret LECs and their responses to TLR ligands.

This ability to recognize and respond to a diverse set of microbes is consistent with our previous findings with commercially obtained human LECs (Pegu et al., 2008) . This information will be useful in extrapolating information on LEC-involved host responses to infection and mechanisms of vaccine-mediated protection in ferret animal models to humans.",

            "text": "Due to its primary function in gas exchange the lung is widely exposed to the external environment and to diverse microorganisms. The lung, however, has evolved a number of mechanical and physiological barriers that inhibit colonization by pathogenic microbes (Yoo et al., 2013) . There is a necessarily delicate balance in the lung among the different host immune responses, including inflammation (La Gruta et al., 2007) . Initiation of host immune responses against invading pathogens in the lung mucosal surface requires recognition of PAMPs and activation of complement and other innate and then adaptive immune responses. At the same time, exacerbation of these responses through overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines could result in severe immunopathological damage to the lung. Recent studies have provided evidence for the direct involvement of the lymphatics in both the induction and the resolution of inflammation (Chaitanya et al., 2010; McKimmie et al., 2013; Wilting et al., 2009) . Such findings can provide assistance in the development of strategies to modulate innate immune responses to limit inflammation and lung injury during infection. Chemokines are important mediators of host homeostatic processes and also of host immune responses to pathogens. However, chemokines, such as CCL20, can contribute to the pathology of a number of chronic and severe inflammatory pulmonary diseases (Demedts et al., 2007; Lukacs et al., 2001) . We have shown here that TLR stimulation of ferret lung LECs led to high levels of production of functional CCL20. The CCL20 and overall patterns of responsiveness to TLR ligands were similar to that of human pulmonary LECs (Pegu et al., 2008) . Given that the receptor for CCL20, CCR6, is expressed on immature DCs and IL-17-producing Th17 cells (Singh et al., 2008) , LECs could play fundamental direct and indirect roles in immune surveillance and mucosal homeostasis.",

These observations provide further evidence that the LV is not simply a passive conduit, but that LECs have more active roles in induction of host innate immune responses and in regulation of inflammation after infection. In sum, the LV presents ongoing opportunities for development of improved vaccine, infection control, and inflammation control strategies.",

The ferret podoplanin cDNA sequence obtained here was examined for its relatedness to podoplanin sequences from other species available from the NCBI/GenBank database. Predicted complete podoplanin ORF sequences derived from genomic DNA are indicated by (*). The phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbor-joining method using the PHYLIP free program with 1000 bootstrap analyses and was drawn with Tree View 1.6.6 (Molecular Evolution). Ferret LECs express multiple LEC marker mRNAs. Standard RT-PCR was used to examine the expression of podoplanin, LYVE-1, PROX-1, VEGFR-3, and CCL21 in total RNA preparations from six ferret LEC populations. The ferrets and tissue types are noted above each column of bands, whereas the target gene is noted to the right of each gel image. The two lung LEC populations, noted by the asterisks (*), were derived from the left or right lobes of lung from the same animal. Primary ferret LECs respond strongly to poly I:C. Confluent monolayers of ferret skin (1 population), lung (1 population), trachea (2 populations), and mesenteric LN (1 population) LECs were exposed to poly I:C for 24 hours and responses were measured by SYBR Green real time RT-PCR for mRNAs encoding the indicated cytokine, chemokine, or ISG. Data are presented as values normalized to the endogenous control GAPDH calculated as 2 (\u0394Ct) . The arrow denotes the data obtained from the lung LEC population used in Fig. 4 . Ferret lung LEC responses to different TLR ligands. Ferret lung LECs (Ferret 2, left lobe lung LEC) were grown until 80 -90% confluent and exposed to the indicated TLR ligands for 24 hr. The levels of the indicated mRNA targets were measured by real-time RT-PCR as presented in Fig. 3 . The dashed line notes the level of expression of each mRNA in untreated cells. The grey bar denotes the poly I:C responses as a frame of reference for comparison to Fig. 3 . Chemotactic responses of ferret CCR6+ responder cells to LEC culture supernatants after TLR ligand stimulation. (A). Chemotaxis was performed using responder cells expressing ferret CCR6 and supernatants from control and TLR ligand treated ferret lung LECs. Chemotactic index (CI) was calculated relative to the medium only control (M). (B). Chemically synthesized ferret CCL20 (Qin et al., 2013) was used as a control (right). The data presented were combined from two independent experiments. In situ hybridization localization of lymphatic marker mRNAs in ferret ferret lymph node, jejunal and lung tissues. 35 S-UTP-labeled riboprobes specific for ferret LYVE-1 or CCL21 were generated and used localize cells expressing the respective mRNAs in the indicated tissue from normal ferrets.
