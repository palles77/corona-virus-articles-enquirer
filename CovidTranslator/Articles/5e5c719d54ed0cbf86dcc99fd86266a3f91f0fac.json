            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are among the most common causes of illness in infants and young children, and respiratory syncytial (RS) virus is a major cause of severe illness requiting hospitalisation, causing 50% of bronchiolitis cases, and 25% of community acquired pneumonias in the first months of life (Mclntosh and Chanock, 1985) . Standard procedures for diagnosing viral respiratory infections, particularly in infants and young children, include the examination of exfoliated epithelial cells in respiratory secretions by immunofluorescence microscopy with virus-specific antibodies (IF) , and viral isolation in tissue cultures (TC). Immunofluorescence microscopy can be relatively time-consuming with results frequently not available until the following day, is subjective rather than objective, with the diagnosis frequently being made on the presence of only a few fluorescent cells, and requires highly trained operators. Viral isolation is extremely timeconsuming, can take up to 3 weeks for results to be available, and is inferior to IF in the diagnosis of respiratory viral infections (Grover et al., 1990) . The availability of effective therapy for RS virus infections, together with the need for early preventive measures to reduce nosocomial infections, has prompted the development of techniques for rapid diagnosis of RS virus infection. These include several enzyme immunoassays (EIA) for detection of viral antigens in clinical samples (Halstead et al., 1990; Subbarao et al., 1989; Johnston and Siegel, 1990; Kok et al., 1990; Freymuth et al., 1991) , and a shell vial technique . When compared to TC, these methods have sensitivities of 71-95% and specificities of 80-100% in several recent studies. The polymerase chain reaction is also being increasingly used for viral diagnosis in clinical samples with encouraging results, but is expensive, and requires elaborate precautions to avoid contamination leading to \u2022 false positive results. (Johnston et al., 1993; Paton et al., 1992) . These new methods of rapid diagnosis for RS virus infection are promising, but require further development before their use can be recommended in routine clinical practice.",

A flow-cytometric assay with immunoreactive beads has been used to detect antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus in human blood, and proved superior to enzyme immunoassay (Scillian et al., 1989) .

The assessment of the number of cells expressing a given degree of fluoresence is analysed objectively according to consistent predetermined criteria, and is performed on a larger number of cells than in routine IF testing. In this study, the minimum number of cells within the positive gate was 25 cells for the 0.5% cut-off and 50 ceils for the 1% cut-off, and the maximum was 350 cells. Flow cytometry could be used as an alternative to immunofluorescent microscopy of cytospins of tissue culture cells in the confirmation of virus isolation by cell culture. This study has not directly compared flow cytornetry with immunofluorescence of cultured cells, but the pilot study carried out in cultured cells demonstrated Table 2 Comparison of flow cytometry with tissue culture and immunofluorescent microscopy, and immunofluorescent microscopy alone, using 1% of cells within the gate as the definition of a positive sample by flow cytometry very dear differentiation between positive and negative samples for RS virus, influenza type A, adenovirus and parainfluenza virus type 3, while CMV and coronavirus 229E were slightly less clear-cut with a broad range of intensity of fluorescence, and relatively high fluorescence in the negative samples ( Fig. 1 and Table 1) . Flow cytometry could also be used as an alternative to IF testing in the rapid diagnosis of clinical samples directly, where the benefit of both a rapid and objective diagnosis is attractive. Compared with IF alone and using the 1% cut off, the specificity of flow cytometry was 93%, but the sensitivity was only 47%, while using the 0.5% cut off, the sensitivity was 74%, but at the cost of reduced specificity of 80%. The clinical samples demonstrated quite variable degrees of non-specific fluorescence, such that a lower gate setting would have resulted in large numbers of false positive results. Attempts were made to block such fluorescence with bovine serum albumin, newborn goat serum, foetal calf serum and cows milk proteins without success (data not shown). This application clearly requires considerable further development: possible methods of improving the results include the use combined flow cytometry and nucleic acid hybridisation as recently reported for the Table 3 Comparison of flow cytometry with tissue culture and immunofluorescent microscopy, and immulaOflUOrescent microscopy alone, using 0.5% of cells within the gate as the definition of a positive sample by flow cytometry diagnosis of CMV infection (Link et al., 1992) , or by employing double staining with mAbs to cytokeratin or desmosomal proteins to identify epithelial cells which could then be gated, and the virus-specific fluoresence assessed.",

Reducing the number of cells required within the gate, or moving the position of the gate to a lower fluorescence level would have resulted in larger numbers of 'false positives' with flow cytometry. However,it is possible that such samples are in fact 'false negatives' with existing methods. We have recently demonstrated with the use of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of picornavirus infections, that there is a very high 'false negative' rate with cell culture methods for picornaviruses, PCR detecting more than 3 times as many positive samples in clinical specimens (Johnston et al., 1993) . However a recent report using PCR for the diagnosis of RS virus infection in clinical samples showed PCR to be equivalent to cell culture (Paton et al., 1992) , suggesting that for RS virus, the false negative rate with cell culture may be low, The shapes of the histograms (Fig. 2) suggest a large population of uninfected cells, with only small numbers of infected cells within the gate, also suggesting that there are unlikely to be large numbers of false negative samples.",
