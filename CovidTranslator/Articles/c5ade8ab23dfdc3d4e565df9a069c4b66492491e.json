            "text": "For more than 2,000 years, it was thought that malignant spirits caused diseases. By the end of nineteenth century, these beliefs were displaced by more modern concepts of disease, namely, the formulation of the \"germ theory,\" which asserted that bacteria or other microorganisms caused disease. With the emergence of chronic degenerative and of autoimmune diseases in the last century, the causative role of microorganisms has been intensely debated; however, no clear explanatory models have been achieved. In this review, we examine the current available literature regarding the relationships between infections and 16 autoimmune diseases. We critically analyzed clinical, serological, and molecular associations, and reviewed experimental models of induction of and, alternatively, protection from autoimmune diseases by infection. After reviewing several studies and reports, a clinical and experimental pattern emerges: Chronic and multiple infections with viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus, and bacteria, such as H. pylori, may, in susceptible individuals, play a role in the evolvement of autoimmune diseases. As the vast majority of infections pertain to our resident microbiota and endogenous retroviruses and healthy carriage of infections is the rule, we propose to focus on understanding the mechanisms of this healthy carrier state and what changes its configurations to infectious syndromes, to the restoration of health, or to the sustaining of illness into a chronic state and/or autoimmune disease. It seems that in the development of this healthy carriage state, the infection or colonization in early stages of ontogenesis with key microorganisms, also called 'old friends' (lactobacilli, bifidobacteria among others), are important for the healthy living and for the protection from infectious and autoimmune syndromes.",

This medical belief dominated the medical thinking until the nineteenth century [1] when it was challenged by Rudolf Virchow's cellular pathology, which stated that diseases derived from perturbations in cellular behavior. Later on, Louis Pasteur's proposal of the germ theory and Robert Koch's postulates lead the medical and scientific communities to accept the infectious origin of diseases. This heralded a new period in medicine and biology: Hundreds of new diseases were described, and new techniques for diagnosis and treatment were developed. In parallel, the phenomena of immunity (capacity to resist infections) started to be systematically studied, hence, giving birth to immunology. With the introduction of basic sanitary systems and antibiotics, infection mortality decreased, and chronic degenerative diseases, namely, atherosclerosis, cancer, and autoimmune diseases, emerged as the leading cause of morbidity and mortality (at least in the Western world) [2] . These diseases have an inflammatory/immune basis, and the distinction of infectious diseases from inflammatory or autoimmune diseases is not clear-cut.",

            "text": "The occurrence of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been associated with several infections, among them are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Parvo B19, and chronic hepatitis C [4, 5] . In earlier studies, patients with RA exhibited increased titers of anti-EBV nuclear antigen 2 antibodies and increased frequency of circulating EBV-infected B cells compared to the healthy controls [5] . More recently, they also have been shown to have a tenfold increase in EBV DNA load [6] . Several similarities exist between RA and Parvo B19 infection: Both states are characterized by a chronic course, morning stiffness, joint deformation and destruction, rheumatoid nodules, as well as by the induction of rheumatoid factor (RF) and of cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and transforming growth factor-\u03b1 (TGF-\u03b1). Cases have been reported of RA development after acute Parvo B19 infection and of persistence of B19 RNA and of the VP-1 antigen in the synovial tissue of RA patients [7] . In a study on bone marrow samples from RA patients, 26% were positive for parvovirus B19, as compared to 4% in an historical control group of bone marrow [8] . Regarding bacterial infections, RA has been consistently associated with high titers of antibodies against Proteus mirabilis [9] . In a prospective study of 246 patients with recently diagnosed inflammatory arthritis, and fol-lowed for 1 year, patients' sera was tested against a panel of microorganisms (Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Chlamydia trachomatis, Salmonella typhi, Shigella fexneri, Campylobacer jejune, Yersinia enterocolitica, and parvovirus B19). Almost half of the patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA, 17% fulfilled the European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria for a spondyloarthropathy, and 37% had undifferentiated arthritis. IgM and IgA anti-Proteus mirabilis antibodies were significantly higher in patients positive for the RF, compared with all other patients groups (P<0.0005 and 0.005). In addition, anti-E. coli IgM antibodies were also elevated in RF-positive RA patients, suggesting a role for P. mirabilis and E. coli infection in early seropositive RA [10] .",

These mice fail to develop arthritis in a microbially clean environment. However, a single intraperitoneal injection of zymosan, a crude yeast cell wall extract, can provoke severe arthritis, and \u03b2-glucans, which are the main constituents of zymosan, are responsible for the arthritogenic effect. Blockade of the major \u03b2-glucan receptor is able to prevent SKG arthritis triggered by \u03b2-glucans, and antibiotic treatment of fungi can prevent SKG arthritis in an arthritis-prone microbial environment [11] .",

            "text": "The effect of microbial dose on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) has been demonstrated regarding Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CIA can be induced even in CIAresistant H-2(b) background of C57BL/6 mice when these mice are immunized with CII emulsified in CFA containing a high but not low dose of M. tuberculosis [12] . This high dose of M. tuberculosis seems to be required for maturation of dendritic cells enough to prime CD4+ helper T cells specific to CII antigen in draining lymph nodes of H-2b background of C57BL/6 mice. Using Mycobacterium avium intradermal injection to induce arthritis, researchers have characterized the importance of the chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) in the arthritis-prone DBA1/j CCR2null mouse. This strain has increased susceptibility to autoimmune arthritis induced by immunization with collagen type II (CII) and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). After intradermal infection with M. avium, a similar arthritis phenotype was detected in CCR2-null mice in the DBA/1j but not in the BALB/c background. These findings demonstrate that the CCR2-null state in an arthritic-prone genetic background leads to increased arthritis susceptibility after infectious (M. avium) and noninfectious (CII/CFA) challenges [13] . In an in vitro study on the effects of Helicobacter pylori antigens on B lymphocytes cultures, autoantibodies, such as IgM RF, anti-single-stranded DNA and anti-phosphatidylcholine antibodies, were detected in the cultures' supernatant after the stimulation with H. pylori urease [14] . Thus, it seems that certain bacteria and fungi can activate arthritogenic T cells and evoke autoimmune arthritis in individuals who are genetically prone to produce arthritogenic autoimmune T cells.",

In another study, the oral administration of the viable bacterium Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota (LcS) to DBA/ 1 mice reduced the incidence and the development of CIIinduced arthritis and reduced the levels of specific antibodies to CII in serum compared with the control mice [16] . The administration of LcS also inhibited delayed-type hypersensitivity response to CII in DBA/1 mice immunized with CII and CFA and suppressed the CII-specific secretion of interferon-gamma (INF-\u03b3) from splenocytes ex vivo. These results suggest that the oral administration of LcS is able to modify the humoral and cellular immune responses to CII, and these modifications could result in the reduction of the development of CIA in DBA/1 mice.",

T cells primed with the tolerogenic epitope of CII proliferated more when incubated with PAAP(+) S. sanguis than with PAAP(\u2212) S. gordonii or CII, suggesting an antigen-specific transmucosal tolerogenic effect. Therefore, in neonatal mice, bacterial surface antigens that mimic self can transmucosally stimulate antigen-specific inhibitory T cells. In adult mice immunized with CII, these antigen-specific inhibitory T cells manifest later as attenuated arthritis.

In a more recent systematic review of case control studies comparing EBV seropositivity and the risk for MS, an odds ratio of 13.5 was found [6] . In two recent large-cohorts' retrospective studies, the strongest predictors of MS were serum levels of IgG antibodies to EBNA complex or EBNA-1 [23, 24] . Among individuals who later developed MS, serum antibody titers to EBNA complex were similar to those of controls before the age of 20 years, but two-to threefold higher at age 25 years and older. The risk of MS increased according to the antibody titers; the relative risk was 9.4 in persons with high EBNA complex titers as compared to those with low titers. In longitudinal analyses, a fourfold increase in anti-EBNA complex or anti-EBNA-1 titers during the follow-up was associated with a threefold increase in MS risk. These results suggest an age-dependent relationship between EBV infection and development of MS [24] . Additional works suggest that early-in-life infection with EBV, usually oligo or asymptomatic, has a protective effect as oppose to laterin-life infection, which is associated with an increased risk for the development of MS [25] . Earlier studies demonstrated that MS patients have defective T-cell control of EBV-infected B cells [6] . A more recent study showed an increased frequency of CD8+ T cells responding to two immunodominant EBV epitopes. In addition, the authors characterized T cell cross reactivity between EBV antigens and the myelin basic protein [6] . The higher titers of measles antibodies in MS patients raised the concern of a possible causal association. However, this concern abated after the introduction of the measles vaccine, which was followed by a sharp drop in the incidence of measles not accompanied by a significant change in the incidence of MS [18] .",

Using a transgenic TMEV coding a Haemophilus influenza peptide, which mimics myelin proteolipid protein (PLP), the authors showed a rapid-onset demyelinating disease in mice. The authors also showed the importance of second signals, such as virus-activated molecules, as the molecular mimicry induced disease only in the TMEV infection context and did not induce disease when PLP was administered with CFA [29] . In another recent work, researchers have shown that the prior well-resolved infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LMCV) during the neonatal period, predisposes adult mice to severe encephalomyelitis caused by a second infection with the same virus, a mechanism proposed as viral \"d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu\" [30] . In addition, transgenic animal models with the \"insertion\" of certain viral protein products have also been associated with the induction of multiple sclerosis [31] . Examining mimics of MS-related encephalitogenic peptides in all known human bacterial and viral peptides, homologies have been found in several organisms, predominantly in nonpathogenic gut bacteria. These suggest that the microorganism responsible for autoimmune activity in MS might be a normally occurring gut bacterium [32] .",

Viral infection can prime T cells specific for central nervous system (CNS) antigens either through molecular mimicry with CNS proteins or through cytokine responses and bystander activation. In a murine model, mice infected with vaccinia virus encoding myelin protein developed clinical disease only after immune activation either with an unrelated virus such as murine cytomegalovirus or CFA, as opposed to challenge with LMCV, which suppressed autoimmunity [34] . In another murine model, an oral vaccine against diarrhea bacteria was capable of protecting mice from the establishment of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) because of immunization with PLP peptide. The protection from disease was accompanied by increases in IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 in lymphocytes culture supernatant, whereas a decrease in INF-\u03b3 secreting cells was demonstrated in the nonvaccinated mice [35] .

Regarding the role of Cox B, epidemiological studies revealed conflicting results on the frequency of anti-Cox B antibodies in newly diagnosed T1D children as compared to nondiabetic controls [39] Several authors have isolated Cox B4 and Cox B5 viruses from the pancreas of patients with acute onset T1D, which could induce diabetes in susceptible mice, providing direct evidence for the involvement of Cox B infection in the development of T1D. Sequence homol-ogy between P-2C, a noncapsid protein of Cox B4 virus and GAD (which is expressed by beta cells), has been described [39] , and antibodies reacting to P-2C and GAD have been detected in T1D patients, providing a mechanism for Cox B4 involvement in the induction of T1D [39] . Despite the aforementioned data, other studies reported conflicting results, and no consensus has yet been achieved on the role of these infections on T1D [37] .

In the NOD mice model, lymphocyte proliferation after lymphocyte loss (known as homeostatic proliferation), occurs as oligoclonal expansions, which are highly associated with disease.

On the other hand, in the absence of this minimum threshold, it protects against diabetes [43] . Similarly, the encephalomyocarditis virus, which is diabetogenic in some mice strains, prevents T1D in NOD mice [39] . Prevention of T1D is postulated to involve induction of T-helper 2 immune responses or deletion of effector cells. Another example of protection from T1D by infection come from studies showing that activation of toll-like receptors through microbial elements protects NOD mice from diabetes, corroborating the hygiene hypothesis and suggesting a protective role of infections against autoimmune diseases [44] . Very recently, it was shown that the experimental infection with Salmonella typhimurium is able to prevent NOD mice from developing diabetes, even after the induction of the disease with cyclophosphamide [45].

These first lupus-specific autoantibodies arise from particular antibodies directed against EBNA-1. In addition, several recent papers have demonstrated increased viral load, increased numbers of latently infected peripheral B cells, impaired functional T cell responses, and association of the presence of EBV DNA in SLE patients compared with the controls [47] [48] [49] . Other authors reproduced similar finding, proposing other associations related to age, gender, anti-EBV immunoglobulin isotype, and CTLA-4 allelic variation [50] .

Another current view is that normal immunity is perturbed by EBV infection and the generation of anti-EBNA-1 antibodies. Those particular anti-EBNA-1 antibodies that also bind lupus-specific autoantigens (Sm or Ro) are followed by the development of more complex autoimmune responses, culminating in clinical disease [47, 48] .",

The chronic course of SLE as opposed to the self-limited presentation of parvo B10 infection distinguishes these two diseases. Regarding CMV, in a study of 22 female patients with SLE, evaluating the presence and quantity of human CMV genome, the authors found the virus genome in 100% of the patients, whereas it was present only in 73% of 15 healthy female controls (p= 0.02) [56] .

Associations have also been reported between APS and chronic HCV infection [4] , CMV [73] , EBV [74] , mycoplasma, pulmonary tuberculosis, malaria, P. carinii, and leptospirosis [3] . One work has showed the increased prevalence of anticardiolpin antibodies from the IgA isotype in patients with HTLV-1associated spastic paraparesis [75] .",

An association has been reported for H. pylori, with a particular form of CD, the ulcerative colitis-like form, through a PCR method, but a negative association was found with the other forms of CD [121] . Interestingly, IBD patients were found to have lower levels of antibodies against H. pylori in comparison to healthy matched controls [122] . In established CD and UC, after 6-13 years of follow-up, patients are seropositive for Yersinia enterocolitica infection [123] . Also, infection with Mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis (MAP) has been shown to occur at increased rates in patients with CD [124] . Very recently, molecular mimicry between MAP proteins and self-peptides has been characterized: Crossreactivity between MAP proteins and a self-peptide gastrointestinal glutathion peroxidase has been reported in 30% of the evaluated patients, proposing a novel autoantigen in this disease [125] . Infection with other microorganisms such as Clostridium difficile, CMV, and Entamoeba hystolitica might also be associated with IBD [126] . Interestingly, it has been observed that appendectomy because of appendicitis (not incidental) decreases risk for UC, but it might increase the risk for the development of CD [126] . As recently reviewed, the manipulation of intestinal flora in patients with IBD through the administration of probiotics, i.e., Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria among others, is a promising field with current clinical trials investigating it [127] .",

Certain class I and II HLA haplotypes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of RHD, which has been shown to involve humoral and cellular immunological components [143] . Molecular mimicry has been proposed to be responsible for the pathogenesis of the disease, which also shows a degenerate pattern of TCR recognition, as T cell clones infiltrating the heart of patients also responded to M protein when subjected to lymphoproliferative tests [144] . In addition, RHD has been induced by immunization with the M protein from group A streptococci [145] . Interestingly, abrogation of the disease was achieved through intranasal administration of protein M epitopes [146] .",

More recently, the disease overture has been found to rely on multiple steps of induction, be it viral persistence, chronic infection of B cells, or viral deja vus.",

            "text": "Several mechanisms have been proposed for the role of infectious agents on the induction of autoimmune diseases. Molecular mimicry or structural homologies between infectious and host components, underlies the pathomechanism in rheumatic fever, where the M component of the streptococcus membrane share homologies with heart, brain, and joint synovium peptides. In susceptible individuals, this molecular mimicry modifies lymphocytes reactivity in a progressive and chronic fashion that ultimately lead to autoimmune disease. Molecular mimicry is considered a putative mechanism also in GBS, APS, and MS. Epitope spreading or the appearance of a new antibody or the T cell response to different epitopes on the same or on another antigen has been demonstrated in experimental models and human diseases. In SLE, authors demonstrated intermolecular spreading from Sm antigen to RNP reactivity, and in pre-clinical diabetes and in RA studies, intra-and intermolecular spreading has been observed [3] . In this context, infections could play an important role either through release of sequestered antigens after tissue damage or upregulation of the display of cryptic epitopes under the inflammatory conditions. Bystander activation is another proposed mechanism in which, under the immune milieu where priming of microbial antigen-specific T cell is taking place, potentially self-reactive T cells are activated. Priming of reactive T cells may occur through an additional mechanism. Infectious agents through tissue injury may cause the release of self antigens, which are processed and presented by antigen-presenting cells, leading to priming of self-reactive T cells. Also, superantigenic T cell activation by viral and bacterial products, which can cross-link the T cell receptor and MHC molecule independent of specific antigen recognition, may favor the induction of an autoimmune disease.",

For the vast majority of patients, symptoms and antibody titers decline. Even in cases where the role of microorganisms is well defined, like in rheumatic fever and Streptococcus pneumoniae groups A, only about 1.2% of infected children actually develop rheumatic fever. Therefore, rather than focusing on the presence or absence of a microorganism in the context of an autoimmune disease, it is the complex immunopathological interaction between the organism and microorganisms, which is the most important factor for the development of an acute infection, for the restoration of health or for the development of a chronic state or an autoimmune disease. This interaction relies in a multitude of factors that include genetic, epigenetic, behavioral, and symbolic factors, as discussed in a recent published book [150] .",

Furthermore, the widespread genetic manipulation of animals and molecules are commonplace in these models. With the help of experimental models, eventually, genetic determinants and pathways are revealed, but often, other determinants remain unclear.
