Crowding increases the overall environmental pathogen load and contact rate and intensifies the effects of many other negative factors, such as poor air quality, excessive noise, and stress. Controlling density is particularly critical in cats. Although cats may choose to live in loose-knit groups in the wild, they are poorly adapted to close confinement [14] . Managing population density in a shelter can be an emotional as well as logistic challenge, however. The constant excess of homeless cats often leads well-meaning shelter managers to house more cats than the facility can readily accommodate. It is important to recognize that crowding is likely to cost rather than save lives in the long run, through increased infectious disease, a damaged shelter reputation, and reduced adoptions.",

For group-housed cats, the recommended minimum is 1.67 m 2 per cat (5.5 ft 2 ), with a maximum group size of 10 cats [15] [16] [17] . The number of cats available for adoption should be driven by the expected number of adoptions rather than by the maximum For a given facility size and staffing level, crowding can be controlled through limiting admissions, euthanasia, or decreasing the amount of time each cat is in the shelter (turnover time). Clearly, the latter would be the preferred choice whenever possible. Turnover time is reduced by daily assessment of every cat in the shelter to make decisions and take any needed action at the earliest possible point. This includes medical and behavioral assessment, surgical sterilization or other preadoption procedures, resolution of legal issues, and placement for public viewing. The less time a cat spends in the shelter, the less likely it is to become ill, further reducing the population burden on the facility [19] . The impact on turnover should be kept in mind when developing policies that delay placement for adoption.",

Scratching posts, soft furniture, and home-like environments can become heavily contaminated over time. Ideally, bedding and toys should be washable, and larger items, such as scratching posts, if used, should be periodically replaced (particularly after a known contamination with a durable agent, such as ringworm or parvovirus). Some pathogens, such as ascarid eggs and coccidial cysts, are virtually impossible to inactivate or remove from porous surfaces [27] .

            "text": "The logistics of cat cage cleaning can be problematic. Many shelters house cats in single cages, necessitating removal and extensive handling to clean. Moving cats from cage to cage can cause sufficient stress to activate latent feline herpesvirus (FHV) infection [28] . Extensive fomite spread is almost inevitable in this circumstance. Ideally, individually housed cats should be provided with double-sided cages or switched between the same two cages throughout their shelter stay. An alternative is to assign each cat its own carrier or ''feral cat'' box for use during cleaning. If the cage size is sufficient, the carrier can remain in the cage to provide a hiding place, providing the added benefit of stress reduction [29] . Less frequent cage cleaning (within reason) has been correlated with improved health in laboratory rodents [30] . In shelters that house healthy cats for extended periods, intensive daily cleaning may not be required, although frequent litter box cleaning and removal of any visible debris are necessary under all circumstances. It may be beneficial to leave bedding with the animal if it is not heavily soiled [31] . Fomite transmission on human hands and clothing is, of course, a significant means of disease spread. This poses a particularly vexing problem in the shelter population, where human interaction must be encouraged to some extent to promote socialization and adoption of the shelter's charges. Friendly signs can be posted to remind the public not to touch cats, but unless given a reasonable alternative, the desire to interact with the animals often outweighs caution. Alcohol hand sanitizers are commonly used and better than nothing in most cases, although they do not reliably inactivate some important feline pathogens, such as panleukopenia virus, FCV, and dermatophytes [24, 25, 32, 33] . When possible, thorough handwashing or a change of gloves is greatly preferred. This is important for prevention of zoonotic disease transmission as well as for shelter cat health. Handwashing stations for the public and staff should be planned in new facilities. Lightweight plastic gloves used in food service can be obtained inexpensively; some shelters require that the public as well as staff wear gloves and change gloves between cats. Other shelters house cats in solid-fronted cages with an attached toy that can be used for interaction. If solid-fronted cages are used, careful attention must be paid to ensure adequate ventilation.",

Ideally, isolation areas should be further subdivided to separate cats with respiratory infections from those with skin or gastrointestinal infections.

Air cleaning: processing indoor air through a filter (ie, HEPA filter) Indoor air contamination is reduced by decreasing population density, cleaning litter boxes frequently, using low-dust litter, and applying cleaning products at the correct dilution. Cleaning products themselves can be respiratory irritants and should not be sprayed around cats. A fresh air exchange rate of 10 to 12 air exchanges per hour is commonly recommended [38] . The relevant air exchange rate is at the level of the cat's nose, however, which may be quite a bit lower than the overall air exchange rate in the room, especially if cats are housed in cages that are enclosed on three sides [39] . High air exchange rates are costly in terms of heating and cooling; thus, design of caging to take full advantage of ventilation systems is crucial. In shelters with poor air exchange systems, air filters are sometimes used as an adjunct to improve air quality. The efficacy of this approach in reducing feline disease has not been documented. Frequent filter changes are required, which may lead to substantial costs. Investment in fresh air sources, such as adding a window or skylight with a fan, may provide a better return in the long run, especially in mild climates. The importance of source control should never be overlooked.",

Space limitations make some of these provisions impractical in some shelters, but even simple interventions, such as toys and a paper bag or box to hide in, can reduce stress and improve adoptability [49] . Additional recommendations for group-housed cats include provision of multiple litter boxes of various types (including at least one or two uncovered litter boxes) and multiple feeding stations to avoid competition around resources. Regardless of housing type, cats benefit from reduction of noise, exposure to natural light and fresh air, a variety of toys, and consistent friendly interaction with known caretakers.

The effect of group versus single housing on feline stress levels is variable, however, and depends on the density and quality of housing, the temperament and prior experience of the cats, and the rate of turnover. Boarding cats observed for their first 14 days in a cattery did not show significant differences in stress levels between cats housed singly, in pairs, or in small low-density groups (\\10 cats per group with 2-3 m 2 of space per cat) in a boarding cattery [42] . In animal shelters, cats housed at high density or in large groups displayed more signs of stress than cats housed singly [16, 50] . Cats that had not been socialized to other cats also experienced more stress in group housing [51] . Stable groups are preferred to the extent possible, because the introduction and departure of new animals inevitably create some stress as well as disease control challenges [41, 50] . Group housing should not be viewed as a way to inexpensively house large numbers of cats, regardless of individual needs, but may be valuable as an alternative to single caging as long as it is used appropriately, particularly in shelters that often house cats for more than a few weeks [52] .",

Poorly controlled volunteer interactions may actually increase stress for some cats, however. Interaction with strangers and being moved from a familiar cage are potentially stressful events, especially if the cat is taken to a room filled with the smells of many unfamiliar animals [44, 47] . Cats' willingness to approach unfamiliar people is highly variable and often follows a slower schedule than if the interaction is initiated by the person [53] . Cat socialization programs should be responsive to the individual cat's needs. Some cats may do better if allowed to initiate interaction at their own pace, and it may be preferable to groom or play with cats in their own cage rather than moving them to another room, especially in shelters where cats stay short term. Limiting indirect exposure to other cats is also preferable from a disease control perspective. An advantage of group housing (or spacious single cat housing) is that it allows interaction with cats on their own turf and offers cats the opportunity to withdraw at will.",

A disadvantage of intranasal vaccines (and, to a lesser extent, modified live vaccines in general) is the possibility of mild signs induced by the vaccine. For shelters that euthanize all symptomatic cats, this is a tremendous drawback. Anecdotally, shelters report varying results from use of an intranasal rather than parenteral vaccine to control URI; some have reported an increase, some have reported a decrease, and some have appreciated little change in overall URI levels. One study suggested that use of an intranasal respiratory virus vaccine in addition to a parenteral three-way feline viral rhinotracheitis-caliciviruspanleukopenia (FVRCP) vaccine resulted in decreased severity of URI in shelter cats [56] .",

Maintaining adequate nutritional intake for sheltered cats can be challenging for several reasons. Cats in a shelter may not eat enough because of stress, illness, competition for food in group housing, an unpalatable or novel diet, or simple underfeeding. Cats tend to be neophobic and may take some time to acclimate to an unfamiliar food [58] . Because of this, it is particularly important to feed cats a consistent diet rather than a variety of donated foods, as is sometimes practiced in shelters. Poorquality or spoiled donated food also may lead to vomiting and diarrhea, which obscures recognition of infectious conditions and creates a poor public image. A high-quality readily absorbed diet can help to compensate for slightly decreased intake, although the benefits of a premium diet must balance the increased cost. The diet should be appropriate to the life stage of the cat. If donated food is used, a consistent brand or gift certificates to a local feed store are preferable to a random mix. If a consistent brand absolutely cannot be obtained, donations should be carefully inspected to make sure they are not damaged or spoiled and food should be thoroughly mixed to provide as consistent a blend as possible rather than switching from one brand to another [59] .",

Cats in short-term shelter care should be offered the high end of the amount recommended by the manufacturer. This may need to be modified for cats in long-term care to prevent obesity. Monitoring and documentation of intake are important, especially when multiple caretakers are involved. Daily written notation should be made as to whether a cat seems to be eating (food should be measured if in doubt), and cats should be weighed at least every 2 weeks.
