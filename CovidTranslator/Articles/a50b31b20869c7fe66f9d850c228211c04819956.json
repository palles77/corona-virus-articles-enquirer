            "text": "Background: The elevated risk of occupational infection such as tuberculosis among health workers in many countries raises the question of whether the quality of occupational health and safety (OHS) and infection prevention and control (IPC) can be improved by auditing. The objectives of this study were to measure (1) audited compliance of primary health-care facilities in South Africa with national standards for OHS and IPC, (2) change in compliance at reaudit three years after baseline, and (3) the inter-rater reliability of the audit. Methods: The study analyzed audits of 60 primary health-care facilities in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. Baseline external audits in the time period 2011e2012 were compared with follow-up internal audits in 2014e2015. Audits at 25 facilities that had both internal and external audits conducted in 2014/2015 were used to measure reliability. Results: At baseline, 25% of 60 facilities were \"noncompliant\" (audit score<50%), 48% \"conditionally compliant\" (score >50 < 80%), and only 27% \"compliant\" (score >80%). Overall, there was no significant improvement in compliance three years after baseline. Percentage agreement on specific items between internal and external audits ranged from 28% to 92% and kappa from -0.8 to 0.41 (poor to moderate). Conclusion: Low baseline compliance with OHSeIPC measures and lack of improvement over three years reflect the difficulties of quality improvement in these domains. Low inter-rater reliability of the audit instrument undermines the audit process. Evidence-based investment of effort is required if repeat auditing is to contribute to occupational risk reduction for health workers.",

South Africa is a high burden country for both TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, making protection of health workers through infection prevention and control (IPC) and occupational health and safety (OHS) priority areas of health-care management [10] .

However, there is evidence to suggest that the quality of both IPC and OHS are in need of improvement in the South African public sector. In nationwide external baseline audits conducted in South Africa in 2011e2012 by a nongovernmental organization (described further in the following), the proportion of fixed public health-care facilities \"fully compliant\" with IPC standards was reported to be very low at 0.82% (32 of 3880) [12] . With regard to IPC and OHS, the national mean facility IPC score (averaged over all facilities) was reported as 47% for primary health-care (PHC) facilities and that for the subset domain of OHS as 76% (PHC facilities and hospitals combined). Both were less than the compliance targets set by the National Department of Health [12] . These findings indicate varying performance across different metrics and raise the question of whether such data are a valid reflection of the actual situation in South African healthcare services.",

Where there was more than one of a certain type of eligible PHC facility in a subdistrict, at least 50% of these were selected using a random number generator. These facilities were requested to submit their audit data. If there were no eligible facilities in a particular subdistrict that subdistrict was excluded.

It would have been easier to purchase equipment such as N95 respirators than updating an IPCeOHS policy, changing infrastructure, starting an education/induction programme, or providing medical surveillance without the necessary expertise or resources available.

Of the methods of assessment required across all domains, in the IPC and OHS domains studied here document review, observation, and staff interview were the ones used by auditors.

The completion of a full audit cycle that includes monitoring implementation of changes and follow-up audits has been shown to improve impact [22, 25] . With regard to the PHC a study in the Netherlands has evaluated the determinants of the impact of a primary medical care practice accreditation programme. The factors perceived by primary care professionals to be enablers of impact were as follows: designating one person responsible for the programme, having clear lines of communication and having enthusiasm for quality improvement [26] .",

The lack of this qualified resource in a PHC setting may be one explanation for the relatively poor compliance and lack of improvement found in this study. Because only one nursing staff member may be trained in IPC, given the fewer number of staff at PHC facilities, turnover of such staff would disrupt continuity of IPC. Furthermore, good leadership at ward or operational level of staff who share the vision of the organization, who develop and stimulate others, and who are active is associated with effective action on IPC measures [28] . However, achievement of this positive type of leadership is adversely affected by direct supervision of a large number of staff, which may be another reason for a lack of improvement in our setting [28] .",

A 2013 Iranian study to determine the compliance with the Joint Commission International organizationebased standards for IPC in 23 hospitals using a self-reported questionnaire with hospital staff found an excellent (>75%) pooled mean hospital IPC score of 79% [30] . Whittaker et al. [15] have shown how facilitated gradual improvements in quality were beneficial in a large South African public sector hospital with a poor baseline and large room for improvement, which took up to three years to reach acceptable levels for accreditation. The relative effects of clinical audit and feedback are thus likely to be larger when baseline compliance with standards is low [ [31] . However, overall there is lack of studies in both high-income countries and low-and middle-income countries reporting on the impact of IPC or OHS auditing or accreditation in PHC as opposed to hospital settings.",

However, some legally required OHS practice items were moved from the PHC National Core Standards facility audit tool to the \"district/ subdistrict office\" tool. The latter managerial level tool was used once (but not covered in this study) and subsequently dropped (AM Van den bergdpersonal communication). This reflects reversion to a focus on operational or \"proximate\" measures and neglect of systemic or \"upstream\" factors which may, however, play an important role in determining compliance with protective standards. Finally, a major limitation of the National Core Standards audit tools is that they focus heavily on structure and process measures. As there were no outcome measures, it remains to be seen whether compliance leads to actual improvement in patient or staff outcomes.",

However, internal audits were not available at baseline. In addition, external audits at follow-up were performed only at about half the eligible facilities, as selected by the Office of Health Standards Compliance. Accordingly, to maximize the sample for measuring change over time, we used external audit at baseline and internal at follow-up. This in fact accords with the intention of the Office of Health Standards approach which is that facilities will effect quality improvement and their own (internal) audit after an external audit. The follow-up external audit results were thus used only for the reliability study, although the smaller sample resulted in wide CIs around the agreement metrics.",

Poor inter-rater reliability indicates a large amount of measurement error making it difficult to interpret changes over time as reflecting real improvement or deterioration in quality. Taking into consideration the limited improvements found and the possible upward bias in internal auditing, it is unlikely that there was significant improvement in compliance over the three years of observation. It is possible that feedback alone cannot be relied upon to improve IPC and OHS standards in PHC facilities and that the penalties mentioned earlier may need to be invoked. This may hold lessons for other low-and middle-income countries.",

In lowand middle-income countries, where human resources for health are already scarce and at high burden of infectious diseases such as TB and HIV, it is crucial that health services improve their IPC and OHS practices.
