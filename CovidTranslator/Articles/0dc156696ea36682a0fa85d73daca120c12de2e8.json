Greater than 92% homology was found among the six strains by pair-wise comparison at the nucleotide level. The genes encoded proteins of 451 to 455 residues and the deduced amino acid sequences were more than 91~o homologous. A unique deletion of twelve nucleotides was found at the carboxy terminus of MHV-Y and a three nucleotide deletion was found in MHV-RI, which corresponded to the one previously reported in MHV-A59 and MHV-S. Two internal open reading frames were found within the coding region of the nucleoprotein, the smaller one was specific for the enterotropic strains. It could potentially encode a truncated version of the hypothetical protein described for MHV-A59 and MHV-S.",

Using the isolated RNA as template, first-strand cDNA was synthesised with avian reverse transcriptase (Promega) at pH 8.4 and 42 \u00b0C. The reaction was primed by oligo (dT)l 2_ 18 (Pharmacia, Piscataway, N J) [t5] . The complete N genes of the three virus strains were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as described [15] . One of the primers used in the PCR reaction (5'-ACGTACCCTCTCAACTC-Y) was derived from the leader sequence common to all MHV mRNAs, synthesised based on sequence information from MHV-JHM [24] . The anti-sense primer (5'-ATGACAGCA-AGACATCC-Y), located approximately 100 nucleotides downstream of the termination codon of the N gene in the 3' noncoding region, was synthesised based on sequence information obtained from MHV-A59 [23] (Microsynth AG, Windisch, Switzerland). Prior to the blunt end ligation into the Sma I site of pUC 18 by T4 DNA ligase, the 3' overhangs of the PCR fragments were removed by Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and the DNA fragments were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase (SureClone, Pharmacia) [13-1. For each virus strain three different clones were constructed, each clone originating from a separate PCR reaction.",

When the sequencing results of the three clones of each virus strain were compared among themselves, five differences were found among the MHV-Y clones, four differences among the MHV-RI clones and two among the DVIM clones (data not shown). These apparent differences in nucleotide sequence were most likely due to errors introduced by either the MHV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase during the replication in vivo, by the avian reverse transcriptase during cDNA synthesis or by the taq DNA polymerase during PCR. Each aberrant nucleotide was found only on one clone whereas the corresponding nucleotides on the other two clones were identical. The consensus results of the N gene sequences have been deposited in the GenBank nucleotide sequence bank and were used in the following analysis.",

Homberger reported sequences of three polytropic prototype strains MHV-S, MHV-A59 [-1, 23] and MHV-JHM [-24, 27] . A 12-base deletion was found in MHV-Y but not in any of the other strains, either entero-or polytropic, at the position corresponding to nt 1339-1350 of the MHV-JHM sequence. In addition to this a three nucleotide deletion (nt 1164-1166) was found in MHV-RI corresponding to a similar deletion reported in MHV-S and MHV-A59. This deletion was not found in MHV-Y and DVIM nor has it been described for MHV-JHM. All other variations between the strains were only nucleotide substitutions, no frameshifts or nonsense mutations were observed. In the following homology comparison, all deletions were counted as single mutations regardless of their size. The nucleotide sequences of the N genes of all six MHV strains were more than 92~o homologous ( Table 1 ). The greatest homology was found between MHV-Y and MHV-RI with 47 nucleotide differences (96.6~o). The three enterotropic strains MHV-Y, MHV-RI and DVIM together with MHV-A59 seem to form a closely related group with 96.6-94.6~ homology (47-74 nucleotide differences). The N gene sequence of MHV-JHM differs more significantly from these four strains (92.9-92.1~ homology, 99-108 nucleotide differences) whereas MHV-S seems to hold a midway position, being as close to MHV-Y (68 nucleotide differences, 95.1~o homology) as to MHV-JHM (59 nucleotide differences, 95.7~ homology).",

The comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences reveals greater than 91~o homology between the six proteins (Table 1) . Again the three enterotropic strains and MHV-A59 are most closely related (13-20 amino acid differences, 97.1-95.6~ homology) and MHV-JHM is most distant to these four (30-37 amino acid differences, 93.3-91.9~o homology). MHV-S however, on the amino acid level seems to be closer to MHV-Y (19 amino acid differences, 95.8~ homology) than to MHV-JHM (26 amino acid differences, 94.39/0 homology). MHV contains three to four structural proteins [9] . The N protein together with the genomic RNA forms the nucleocapsid, a long helical structure in the centre of the virion. It is surrounded by the envelope which contains two or three glycoproteins. One of them, the membrane (M) protein, serves as a bridge between the nucleocapsid and the viral envelope while another, the spike (S) protein, forms the characteristic petal-shaped spikes that give the Coronaviridae their name [9] . Some MHV strains possess a third glycosylated protein, the hemagglutinin/esterase (HE). DVIM is the only strain known with a functional HE-protein and while JHM possesses a truncated inactive version it has not been found in MHV-A59, -S, -Y or -RI [19, 30, 32] . Of these proteins HE most likely plays no part in the determination of the tropism since it is not present in all strains. It has previously been shown that the most conserved structural protein M shows no sequence unique to enterotropic strains [13] . A comparison of the most variable of the coronavirus structural proteins, the spike-protein, of MHV-Y and -RI revealed high diversity between these two enterotropic strains. They had only three single amino acids in common which could not be found in the deduced amino acid sequence of either the MHV-A59 or -JHM S protein and could therefore be considered to be unique to the enterotropic strains [19] .",

This hypothetical protein has not yet been detected and seems to be non-essential for the replication of the virus, since it is truncated in MHV-JHM by a stop codon after only 16 amino acids [23] . It is therefore unlikely that this l~rotein has any influence on the primary tropism of a strain.

It has, however, been described in the Nu67 strain of MHV [18] . MHV-Nu67 was isolated from a nude mouse in Japan and seems to be an enterotropic strain.

This study, however, showed that the N genes of these four viruses were closely related. This seeming discrepancy might be explained by a recombination event which had occurred during the evolution of DVIM somewhere in the vicinity of the intergenic region between M and N and had created the virus from an MHV-A59-1ike and an unrelated parental strain. Similar recombination events between MHV strains have been observed repeatedly in vitro as well as in vivo [20] and are considered to be responsible for the great antigenic diversity of this group of viruses. It has been postulated that the N gene of MHV-S as well had resulted from a naturally occurring recombination between two strains similar to MHV-JHM and A59 [23] . Moreover, this study together with previous findings [13] show that MHV-RI may also be a result of a recombination between the two above-mentioned parental strains. The RI M and N sequence is highly homologous with A59 white its S sequence closely resembles that of JHM. The recombination event seems to have taken place somewhere within the nonstructural protein genes between the S and M.",

The N protein does not seem to be important for the determination of the primary tissue tropism of an MHV strain. Possibly a single amino acid change like one of those identified on the S protein [19] or multiple factors located on several different genes could be responsible for the tropism of an isolate. Together with the above mentioned findings this could suggest that the evolution of the enterotropic strains was caused by point mutations rather than recombinations. This question, however, will have to be answered by using targeted recombination to produce new MHV strains carrying specific mutations. Alternatively the inclusive or exclusive involvement of the nonstructurat proteins has to be considered.",
