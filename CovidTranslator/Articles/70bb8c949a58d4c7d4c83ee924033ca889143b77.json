            "text": "Due to the prevalence of different bovine leukosis virus (BLV) species in the cattle population in Europe, problems may arise in the serological diagnosis of BLV infections. In addition, earlier investigations demonstrated that contamination of the BLV antigen-producing cell culture systems by bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) may give rise to misinterpretation of serological test results after BVDV vaccination of cattle. By co-cultivation of peripheral leukocytes of a BLV-infected cow with a permanent sheep kidney cell line, a new BLV-producing cell line named PO714 was established. This line carries a BLV provirus of the Belgian species and has been tested to be free of a variety of possibly contaminating viruses and mycoplasms. Investigations of a panel of well-characterised sera by agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) and capture ELISA (cELISA) tests using antigen prepared from this new cell line in comparison with antigen of the well-known cell line FLK/BLV yielded comparable results. False positive results caused by BVDV cross-reactions could be eliminated when tests were carried out with antigen derived from the new cell line.",

This line was established by cocultivation of fetal lamb kidney (FLK) cells with lymphocytes of an infected cattle in the USA (van der Maaten and Miller, 1976) . Analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (RFLPA) and sequencing showed a close relation of the FLK/BLV provirus to the Australian and Japanese strains (Fechner et al., 1997; Beier et al., 2001; Licursi et al., 2002) . BLV infected cattle in Europe, especially in Germany, however, mostly harbor proviruses closely related to the Belgian provirus line (Rice et al., 1984 (Rice et al., , 1985 Mamoun et al., 1990; Molteni et al., 1996; Blankenstein et al., 1998) .

This contamination may result in additional diagnostic problems concerning the specificity of the reactions (Roberts et al., 1989) . In 1995, an inactivated BVDV vaccine was first applied in bovine leukosis free herds of cattle. Subsequently, an increasing number of positive results 0166-0934/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jviromet.2004.06.017 was observed in routine diagnostic investigations using a distinct ELISA test system for detection of BLV antibodies. Further analysis of these reactions by means of other tests for BLV antibody detection and BLV provirus PCR always yielded negative results. Therefore, it was assumed that crossreactivity occurred between the BVDV antibodies induced by the vaccine and BVDV in the BLV antigen preparation. In the meantime, this assumption could be confirmed in a vaccination study in BLV-free cattle (Beier and Conraths, 1996) . This prompted us to develop a new BLV-producing permanent cell line expressing a European BLV isolate of the Belgian species without contamination by other viruses. This cell line should be useful for antigen production to improve current tests.",

The amount of gp51 and p24 was about 20-30% compared to FLK/BLV. Higher passages (20th-40th passage) showed a higher BLV antigen expression, which was nearly comparable with that of FLK/BLV under the same conditions. As shown in Table 1 , the p24 content in the supernatant was relatively stable for 3 days after passaging for at least 10 subcultivation steps. In addition, Western blot analysis of cell lysates from FLK/BLV and PO714 showed that both cell lines express similar amounts of gp51, p24 and different precursor proteins. Cells of the 20th subculture were shown to express BLV by IFT and EM. Particles with typical retrovirus morphology were detectable in ultrathin sections.

Comparable results were obtained using maintenance medium with 10 and 5% FCS, respectively. The cell line is stable and produces BLV, so far up to the 100th subculture. AGID antigen prepared from cell line PO714 was compared to antigen from a commercial AGID test kit ( Table 2 ). The precipitation lines of the PO714 antigens were confluent with those of the control antigen showing homology between both preparations. The lines were long, clear and distinct and, thus, offer the same quality as the commercial antigen. On an average, the final titres were slightly lower, which, however, had no influence on the test results. Twenty-seven standard and reference sera were investigated in a first AGID test. They included 11 highly positive, 8 weakly positive and 7 negative sera and the EU standard serum \"E4\" (1:10). All highly and weakly positive sera were detected in this test, and no false positive results occurred. In the following, 79 sera from field and laboratory animals infected with BLV of different provirus subtypes were tested in parallel with a commercially available test kit and PO714 antigen. The sera had been characterised using up to five commercial ELISA systems and full blood was tested by env nested PCR. Out of these sera, 20 were positive (9 strongly and 11 weakly positive sera), 57 were negative and 2 were doubtful. Both AGID test systems revealed the same results.",

Fig. 3 shows representative results of the gp51-cELISA. The sera reacted in the same manner when testing by the p24-assay. Thus, both cell lines are suitable antigen sources for cELISA tests. Most of the sera reacted similarly with both antigens. In a few cases, differences occurred in the strength of the reactions: some sera reacted better with FLK/BLV antigen, but others showed a stronger reaction with PO714 antigen. This should not be important for clearly negative or strongly positive sera, but in particular cases (see sample 2468 in Fig. 3 and Table 3 ), it may result in differences in the positive/negative-grading of the sample. This means that weakly positive sera might be detected by only one of the antigens and, thus, might be missed if tested using only one system. Different reactivities were also seen between FLK/BLV and PO714 antigen in p24 cELISA (data not shown).

The new permanent cell line PO714 productively infected with BLV was created by cocultivation of PO cells with a short time culture of leukocytes from a BLV-infected cow. PO714 was of special interest because it is free of other contaminating infectious agents and because it carries a BLV provirus which is different from that of FLK/BLV with an env region closely related to the Belgian species. This is the dominant provirus subtype among cattle in Germany (Fechner, 1995) . Further attempts to isolate BLV from cattle with indifferent serological but positive PCR results and from tumour cells of an intensely tumourous cow killed in a moribund state were not successful. The lymphocytes as well as the tumour cells were contaminated with BVDV and/or bovine foamy virus (BFV) which in each case caused a massive infection of the carrier cells.",

This fact had no consequences for the sensitivity of the test. Sensitivity and specificity of PO714-antigens prepared and used for AGID are comparable to those of commercial test kits making the cell line PO714 attractive for production. The amount of p24antigen appears to be stable and comparable to that produced by the most commonly used FLK/BLV. This is an important parameter for the production of ELISA antigen. Cell culture supernatant of both cell lines was proven to be useful as antigen in cELISA tests for serological investigations. Most of the sera showed the same reaction with both antigens. Only a few sera reacted differently in the two tests demonstrating that there are differences in antigenicity. Thus, antigen from both cell culture systems should be used to reliably demonstrate the absence of BLV during the last stage of eradication programs and to confirm the BLV-free status of a herd.",
