            "text": "Many eukaryotes accomplish cell division by building and constricting a medial actomyosin-based cytokinetic ring (CR). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, a Hippo-related signaling pathway termed the septation initiation network (SIN) controls CR formation, maintenance, and constriction. However, how the SIN regulates integral CR components was unknown. Here, we identify the essential cytokinetic formin Cdc12 as a key CR substrate of SIN kinase Sid2. Eliminating Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation leads to persistent Cdc12 clustering, which prevents CR assembly in the absence of anillin-like Mid1 and causes CRs to collapse when cytokinesis is delayed. Molecularly, Sid2 phosphorylation of Cdc12 abrogates multimerization of a previously unrecognized Cdc12 domain that confers F-actin bundling activity. Taken together, our findings identify a SIN-triggered oligomeric switch that modulates cytokinetic formin function, revealing a novel mechanism of actin cytoskeleton regulation during cell division.",

            "text": ". Despite this early cytokinesis function, Mid1 is nonessential, and cells lacking Mid1 undergo cytokinesis, albeit more slowly and at inappropriate angles and locations (Chang et al. 1996; Sohrmann et al. 1996; Huang et al. 2008; Saha and Pollard 2012) . The septation initiation network (SIN), a GTPase-regulated kinase cascade related to the Hippo pathway (Hergovich and Hemmings 2012) , constitutes a second cytokinesis pathway, which operates independently of nodes and Mid1 (Hachet and Simanis 2008; Huang et al. 2008) . SIN proteins assemble at spindle pole bodies (SPBs), although the terminal SIN kinase Sid2, like its human homolog (Bothos et al. 2005) , translocates to the CR during cytokinesis (Johnson et al. 2012) . Consistent with the SIN being sufficient for CR assembly in S. pombe, precocious SIN activation drives multiple rounds of septation in interphase and permits orthogonal CR formation in mid1D cells (Minet et al. 1979; Huang et al. 2008) . The SIN also governs CR maintenance following node-initiated cytokinesis, and CRs collapse between segregated daughter nuclei when SIN signaling is selec-\u00d3 2013 Bohnert et al.

            "text": "Given that SIN signaling culminates with kinase Sid2 targeting to the CR (Johnson et al. 2012) , protein phosphorylation likely directs the major functional SIN output during cytokinesis. Indeed, Sid2 phosphorylates the nonessential Cdc14 phosphatase Clp1 to foster Clp1's cytoplasmic retention (Chen et al. 2008) . Cytoplasmic Clp1 in turn dephosphorylates the essential F-BAR scaffold protein Cdc15 , helping to induce a conformational change in Cdc15 that promotes CR assembly . Although Cdc15 accumulation within a ring structure ultimately requires SIN activation (Hachet and Simanis 2008) , there is no evidence that Cdc15 is a direct SIN target. While other SIN substrates besides Clp1 have been identified (Feoktistova et al. 2012; Grallert et al. 2012; Mana-Capelli et al. 2012; Gupta et al. 2013) , none account for the essential role of the SIN in Mid1-independent CR assembly.",

We found that SIN induction achieved via inactivation of the inhibitory GAP Cdc16 (Minet et al. 1979 ) resulted in Cdc12-V5 3 hyperphosphorylation (Fig. 1D) . Moreover, the SIN kinase Sid2, which localizes to SPBs and the CR during a cps1-191 cytokinesis arrest (Supplemental Fig. 1B,C) , directly phosphorylated MBP-tagged Cdc12 fragments in vitro (Fig. 1E; Supplemental Fig. 1D, E) , and Cdc12-Flag 3 from cps1-191 sid2-250 arrested cells exhibited faster gel mobility compared with Cdc12-Flag 3 from cps1-191 arrested cells (Fig.  1F ). In accord with Sid2 family kinases targeting RxxS motifs (Mah et al. 2005) , Sid2 phosphorylated exclusively serines on Cdc12 fragments (Supplemental Fig. 1F ). Alanine mutation of Sid2 consensus serines identified residues S824, S1523, S1543, and S1811 as the major Sid2 targeted residues ( Fig. 1E; Supplemental Fig. 1G ). All four of these sites reside outside of well-characterized formin domains (Fig. 1G ). Cells were viable when wild-type cdc12 + was replaced with cdc12-4A, in which the four Sid2 targeted serines are mutated to alanines. However, Cdc12-4A-Flag 3 was not hyperphosphorylated to the same extent as wild-type Cdc12-Flag 3 during a cps1-191 cytokinesis arrest (Fig. 1F ), signifying that Cdc12-4A cannot be fully phosphorylated in vivo. Therefore, we concluded that Sid2 phosphorylates formin Cdc12 during cytokinesis.",

PhosTag (5 mm) was included in the protein gel to enhance separation. Brackets span phosphorylated smears, and asterisks denote a noncollapsible species. CDK was used as a loading control. (G) Schematic of Cdc12, with Sid2 targeted residues labeled in red, and nonphosphorylated Sid2 consensus motifs marked by black ticks. SIN activation appeared unperturbed in cdc12-4A cells, as evidenced by asymmetry of SIN kinase Cdc7, CR localization of Sid2, and Sid2 kinase activity (Supplemental Fig. 3A-C; Johnson et al. 2012 ). Thus, we reasoned that any SIN defects observed in the cdc12-4A mutant were due to eliminating Cdc12 phosphorylation by Sid2. Because the SIN is critical for Mid1/node-independent cytokinesis (Hachet and Simanis 2008; Huang et al. 2008) , we combined mid1D and cdc12-4A alleles. Importantly, cdc12-4A mid1D cells were significantly more defective in cytokinesis than either individual mutant (Fig. 3A; Supplemental Fig. 3D ) and died at elevated temperatures (Supplemental Fig. 3E ). F-BAR protein Cdc15 is also vital for Mid1independent cytokinesis (Hachet and Simanis 2008) , and Sid2-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc14 family phosphatase Clp1 facilitates Cdc15 dephosphorylation and activation (Chen et al. 2008; Clifford et al. 2008; Roberts-Galbraith et al. 2010) . Accordingly, cdc12-4A was synthetically sick with a cdc15 temperature-sensitive allele (Supplemental Fig. 3F ) and exaggerated cytokinesis defects of a clp1-6A-GFP allele (Supplemental Fig. 3G ,H), which eliminates SIN-dependent Clp1 phosphorylation (Chen et al. 2008 ). These results are consistent with Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation representing an important facet of downstream SIN-based CR regulation.",

This is most evident in a cps1-191 b-glucan synthase mutant, which conditionally activates a cytokinetic checkpoint due to impaired septum deposition (Le Goff et al. 1999; Liu et al. 2000) . Although cps1-191 cells form CRs, these mutants require SIN activity for CR maintenance during the arrest (Liu et al. 1999; Mishra et al. 2004; Hachet and Simanis 2008) . Consistent with Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation constituting a critical SIN signal, intact F-actin rings were not observed in cps1-191 cdc12-4A arrested cells as they were in cps1-191 arrested cells (Fig. 4A ). Similar to cps1-191 sid2-250 double mutants (Hachet and Simanis 2008) , cps1-191 cdc12-4A cells often contained medial F-actin clumps flanking ''kissing nuclei'' that had returned to cell middles following failed cytokinesis (Fig. 4A ). We found that these F-actin defects were associated with Cdc12 mislocalization. Whereas Cdc12-GFP 3 maintained a ring structure during a cps1-191 arrest (Fig. 4B ), it accumulated in medial spots in cps1-191 sid2-250 arrested cells (Fig. 4B ). Cdc12-4A-GFP 3 formed similar spot-like structures in a cps1-191 arrest (Fig. 4B) , validating that Sid2 cannot target Cdc12-4A.",

Thus, we assessed whether Sid2-mediated phosphorylation disrupts the function of an uncharacterized Cdc12 domain. To identify such a domain, we introduced C-terminal tags at the endogenous cdc12 + locus to produce serial 100-residue truncations (Supplemental Fig. 4A ). Although overexpression of similar C-terminal truncations is lethal (Yonetani and Chang 2010) , we found that endogenous cdc12 truncations lacking residues C-terminal to Cdc12's FH2 domain were viable (Supplemental Fig. 4B ). Despite comparable viability, these mutants differed in CR phenotypes. Whereas Cdc12(1-1600)-GFP 3 formed complete ring structures, Cdc12(1-1400)-GFP 3 was discontinuous (Fig. 5B) . Thus, we predicted that residues 1400-1600 contain a domain critical to Cdc12 regulation. In complementary experiments, we found that overexpressing the Cdc12 C terminus strongly inhibited cytokinesis (Supplemental Fig. 4C,D) . We also defined a minimal C-terminal fragment (residues 1451-1538) that was sufficient for this activity ( Fig. 5C ; Supplemental Fig. 4C,D) . Importantly, this fragment overlaps with the region contributing to CR formation (Fig. 5A,B) , suggesting that residues 1451-1538 comprise a functional domain.",

Furthermore, overexpressed GFP-cdc12(1451-1538) itself was detectable in clusters at separated SPBs when the cellular signal intensity was not overamplified (Supplemental Fig. 5B,D) . In line with cdc12(1451-1538) functioning as a dominant-negative to wild-type cdc12 + , overexpression of this domain was less toxic in a cdc12D1451-1538 mutant lacking these residues endogenously (Supplemental Fig. 5E ). We also found that endogenous Cdc12D1451-1538-GFP 3 , unlike wild-type Cdc12-GFP 3 (Coffman et al. 2009 ), never formed interphase spots (Supplemental Fig. 5F ,G).

As two Sid2-directed phosphosites were within or near the Cdc12 oligomerization domain (Fig. 5A) and Cdc12 clustered during cytokinesis upon loss of this phosphorylation (Fig. 4B) , we asked whether Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation regulates this self-interaction. First, we immunoprecipitated wild-type Cdc12-Flag 3 or phosphomutant Cdc12-4A-Flag 3 from a cps1-191 arrest in which wild-type Cdc12 is phosphorylated by Sid2 (Fig. 1F ) and tested whether immunoprecipitates bound His 6 -Cdc12(1451-1538). Only Cdc12-4A-Flag 3 bound His 6 -Cdc12(1451-1538) (Fig. 5G ). Next, we repeated the in vitro binding experiments with recombinant proteins, but bead-bound MBP-Cdc12(1451-1538) was phosphorylated by Sid2-Myc 13 prior to incubation. We found that phosphorylation by Sid2-Myc 13 significantly abrogated the self-interaction (Fig. 5H) . Consistent with phosphorylation negatively regulating oligomerization, alanine mutation of S1523 in cdc12(1451-1538) created a stronger dominant-negative that hastened cytokinesis defects upon overexpression (Supplemental Fig. 5H,I) . Collectively, these data indicate that Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation counteracts C-terminal self-interaction and that abnormal Cdc12 clustering occurs when multimerization persists.",

Although a Cdc12CD1451-1538 mutant fragment that lacks the oligomerization domain (Supplemental Fig. 6B ) bound F-actin with higher affinity than the intact C terminus (Supplemental Fig. 6C,D) , this mutant did not bundle F-actin but instead formed disordered cross-links (Fig. 6F) . Thus, the Cdc12 oligomerization domain supports the organization of F-actin into linear bundles in vitro, although this domain itself cannot efficiently bind F-actin (Supplemental Fig. 6E ).",

Indeed, still and time-lapse imaging of Cdc12D1451-1538-GFP 3 hinted at defective CR condensation in this mutant (Supplemental Figs. 5F, 6F). To score this defect, we quantified condensed and noncondensed CRs in mitotic cdc25-22 cells at permissive temperature. We found that roughly a quarter of cdc12D1451-1538 binucleates possessed medial actin that had yet to condense into a ring (Fig. 6H,I) . In contrast, nearly all cdc12 + binucleates showed a condensed CR (Fig. 6H,I) . These data suggest that Cdc12 multimerization initially facilitates ordered F-actin bundling to promote early stages of CR formation and that Sid2-based reversal of multimerization subsequently limits this activity.",

Why spots form and how they relate to formin activity and CR formation have been topics of debate (Roberts-Galbraith and . Although a previous study implicated Cdc12's N-terminal FH3 domain in spot formation, this same study demonstrated more dramatic clustering upon Figure 7 . Model for Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation in fission yeast cytokinesis. (A) During interphase, Cdc12 exists in a spot-like structure, which serves as a reservoir. At mitotic onset, anillin-like Mid1 assembles medial nodes to which Cdc12 and other CR factors are recruited. Nodes spatially restrict Cdc12 spot formation and aid in initial declustering. As CRs form from nodes, multimeric Cdc12 bundles F-actin, aiding in CR condensation. Upon full activation of the SIN, Sid2 phosphorylates Cdc12 to inhibit multimerization of Cdc12's C-terminal oligomerization domain. This oligomeric switch facilitates mature CR assembly and maintenance by blocking Cdc12 spot formation once Mid1 has exited the CR in late cytokinesis. (B) Typically, cdc12 + cells maintain a CR during a cytokinesis arrest and undergo septation in interphase when the SIN is prematurely activated. In these contexts, CRs do not collapse because Cdc12 clustering is inhibited by the SIN. However, when the SIN kinase Sid2 cannot phosphorylate Cdc12, Cdc12 and other CR proteins cluster abnormally, similar to when Cdc12's oligomerization domain is overexpressed. Persistent multimerization leads to the formation of spot-like structures during a cytokinesis arrest or in SIN-activated interphase cells. Thus, Sid2-mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation constitutes a critical SIN signal, which reverses Cdc12 multimerization at the appropriate time to enable proper CR performance. overexpression of Cdc12's C terminus (Yonetani et al. 2008) . Indeed, we found that C-terminal multimerization facilitates spot formation during interphase or when the self-association domain is hyperabundant (Fig. 7A,B) . In both contexts, Cdc12 cannot induce cytokinesis, supporting the ideas that (1) spots serve as reservoirs that restrict formin function (Yonetani et al. 2008; Coffman et al. 2009 ), and (2) the Cdc12 C terminus possesses an inhibitory domain (Yonetani and Chang 2010) . When interphase is prolonged and CR proteins prematurely localize to the division site, even more pronounced Cdc12 spots develop . Thus, Cdc12 clusters can expand with time if relevant disassembly cues are not triggered.",

During early mitosis, Mid1/node-dependent pathways may initially antagonize Cdc12 clustering (Fig. 7A ) because, in their absence, CRs assemble from spot-like asters (Huang et al. 2008) . Two separate Mid1-dependent modules, based on either myosin and IQGAP Rng2 or Cdc15, recruit Cdc12 medially (Laporte et al. 2011) , where Cdc12 likely binds multiple node proteins capable of serving as cortical anchors (Saha and Pollard 2012; Guzman-Vendrell et al. 2013) . Presumably, these anchors spatially restrict Cdc12 clustering but permit some degree of Cdc12 multimerization that facilitates F-actin bundling (Fig. 7A) . In support of Mid1/node-dependent pathways contributing declustering signals during CR formation, cdc12-4A cells undergo cytokinesis when the cell cycle is otherwise unperturbed. Despite Mid1-based compensation at the CR, Cdc12-4A still accumulates at SPBs during CR constriction, consistent with a multimer disassembly defect and other data suggesting an SPB-Cdc12-binding interface (Petersen et al. 1998) .",

Previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylation can disrupt autoinhibitory formin interactions (Takeya et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2009 ). Our results provide a striking parallel, revealing that formin trans interactions, which mediate oligomerization, can also be phosphoregulated. While our model (Fig. 7A) proposes that tandem Mid1/ node-and SIN-dependent declustering signals ensure efficient CR assembly and maintenance, other mechanisms likely contribute to activation of formin nucleation and elongation activities because rudimentary filament-like structures still form in the absence of Mid1 and Sid2mediated Cdc12 phosphorylation (Fig. 3E) .",

            "text": "Although it is well established that formin dimerization via FH2 domains allows efficient actin nucleation and barbed end elongation (Xu et al. 2004) , it has been unclear whether formins can form higher-ordered oligomers and, if so, what function these oligomerization events would serve. In this study, we showed that C-terminal multimerization promotes Cdc12-mediated F-actin bundling. It seems reasonable that Cdc12 would possess an F-actin bundling domain because (1) node condensation and mature CR formation require F-actin bundling (Laporte et al. 2012) , and (2) node-localized Cdc12 is ideally positioned for this task (Coffman et al. 2009 ). Our data indicate that Cdc12 may cooperate with myosin in pulling F-actin into a ring structure ( Fig. 7A ; Vavylonis et al. 2008) , and this activity may be particularly useful for incorporating nonmedial F-actin cables into the CR (Huang et al. 2012) . Because Cdc12 F-actin bundling activity correlates with its C-terminal oligomeric state, the Sid2-based phosphoregulatory switch must be precisely timed; whereas delayed reversal of multimerization during cytokinesis suspends formin declustering and precipitates CR collapse, premature loss of multimerization during early mitosis jeopardizes F-actin bundling and likewise hinders CR formation.",

While F-actin bundling activities have been demonstrated for multiple eukaryotic formins, of these, only Cdc12 and mammalian FRL3 contain F-actin bundling domains distinct from their FH1FH2 regions (Vaillant et al. 2008) , and Cdc12 is the first known in which that activity is specifically regulated. Indeed, the separation of Cdc12's F-actin bundling and FH1FH2 domains likely allows for differential temporal control of nucleating and bundling activities and precludes competition between them. In the future, it should prove fruitful to determine how the Cdc12 C terminus, which we showed possesses F-actin bundling activity, impacts the well-characterized activities of the Cdc12 FH1 and/or FH2 domains.",

High-speed centrifugation at 150,000g and low-speed centrifugation at 10,000g were performed for 30 min at room temperature using a TLA-100 rotor (Beckman Coulter) or a Centrifuge 5424 (Eppendorf), respectively. Following centrifugation, pellets and supernatants were separated, and equal portions of pellets and supernatants were resolved by SDS-PAGE for Coomassie blue staining. The affinity (K D ) of Cdc12 fragments for F-actin was calculated by fitting a quadratic equation to high-speed binding data.",
