The piglets were killed at intervals of 12 to 120 h after infection. The coronavirus-like agent caused a local infection of the intestinal tract which resulted in villous atrophy, malabsorption and diarrhea. The pathogenesis of this infection was similar to that of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), a known coronaviral infection of pigs. However, there were some differences. By immunofluorescent staining, CV 777 antigens were not only detected in the epithelial cells covering the small intestinal villi, but also in the cells of the colonic surface epithelium. Occasional fluorescence was also seen in the small intestinal crypt epithelium, but the regenerative capacity of the crypts was not affected. The progress of intestinal epithelial cell infection by CV 777 was much slower than that in TGE, resulting in a longer incubation period and in less drastic epithelial cell destruction. The infection of regenerating cells occurred to a much higher degree during the late stage of a CV 777 infection than has been observed in TGE.",

The pathogenesis of the intestinal infection due to these viruses is well documented Haelterman, 1966, 1969; Pensaert et al., 1970a, b; Butler et al., 1974; Pearson and McNulty, 1977; Theft et al., 1978) . Both viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the absorptive epithelial cells on the villi of the small intestine. Subsequent destruction and detachment of these epithelial cells leads to shortening of the villi. The morphological and functional alterations induced by virus replication produce diarrhea, especially in baby pigs. The crypt epithelium is not affected and this enables a quick regeneration of the villi. In spite of this regeneration, death results from dehydration, particularly in TGE-infected piglets.",

There was a positive correlation between the viral replication and the development of histologic and ultrastructural lesions in the intestines (to be reported in separate papers). A first peak in the number of fluorescent cells, observed shortly after the onset of diarrhea, coincided with a shortening of the villi. Infection of villous epithelial cells by the CVLA apparently led to destruction or sloughing of the cells into the intestinal lumen, resulting in a certain degree of villous atrophy. Diarrhea was a consequence of the malabsorption due to this loss of absorptive cells. However, diarrhea may also be caused by functional disorder of these infected cells, since the onset of diarrhea was seen before the appearance of villous atrophy. A similar sequence of events was reported with porcine rotaviral infection (Theil et ai., 1978) and with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), but in the latter infection events proceed much more quickly.",

Although this has also been described by Pomeroy et al. (1978) in turkey embryos infected with turkey enteritis coronavirus, its pathogenic importance is unclear. In CVLA infection, fluorescence in the crypt epithelium was distinct but remained limited to a few scattered areas throughout the infection, and histologic data did not suggest epithelial damage (W. Coussement et al., to be published). Furthermore, the regenerative capacity of the crypts of Lieberkiihn was not affected as indicated by the presence of newly produced undifferentiated cells on the regrowing villi (R.
