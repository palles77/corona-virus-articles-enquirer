This test was compared with three other diagnostic tests using fifteen faecal samples. Bovine coronavirus was detected in 2 samples by direct electron microscopy (DEM), in 3 samples by immunosorbent electron microscopy, in 5 samples by haemadsorption-elution-haemagglutination and in 6 samples by IGEM. Ninety four faecal samples were tested by DEM and IGEM. Of 26 samples found to contain BCV by IGEM only 14 were positive by DEM. The IGEM technique is simple, efficient and less susceptible than others to non-specific reactions.",

Our results confirmed that when faecal samples containing BCV were examined by DEM coronavirus particles were usually observed to be widely spaced and the background heavily contaminated with debris. Equivocal results were compounded by the presence in faeces of other fringed particles which could be mistaken for coronavirus (Dea et al., 1981) . In this study a higher sensitivity and specificity were observed in ISEM prepa- rations. However around 30% of faecal samples still contained virus-like particles which could not be unequivocally determined to be BCV. An attempt was made to further increase the sensitivity and specificity of BCV diagnosis by combining the concentrating effect of ISEM with the specific labelling of antibody conjugated to colloidal gold in an IGEM test. This was successfully achieved, with the IGEM allowing coronavirus-like particles to be diagnosed accurately as BCV or debris. The results of the coronavirus purification on a sucrose gradient gave further confirmation of specificity. The peplomers of coronavirus particles were rarely seen in IGEM preparations as the antibody coating seemed to obscure these projections.",
