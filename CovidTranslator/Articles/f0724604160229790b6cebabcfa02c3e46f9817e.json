Results from studies with this diagnostic modality have significantly expanded our knowledge about the seasonality of viral respiratory diseases, pinpointed the difficulties to make a reliable etiologic diagnosis without the aid of an unbiased multiplex molecular assay for respiratory viruses, and revealed previously unknown details as to possible infections with multiple agents as aggravating factors. The scope of this article is to review and discuss this new knowledge and its implications for diagnostic strategies and other measures essential for the clinical management of respiratory viral infections and for epidemiological surveillance of seasonal respiratory infections.",

These tests are relatively cheap, rapid, sensitive and suitable for the analysis of a respiratory specimen for 15 or more agents assayed simultaneously. This has prompted clinicians to submit a larger number of specimens for virological examination than ever expected. The most important lessons learned from the last few years of organized molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses are that it is more difficult than anticipated, even for an experienced clinician to make an etiologic diagnosis based on clinical data alone, and that positive specimens may often contain two or more respiratory viruses. This indicates that several viruses may replicate in the respiratory tract at the same time, with the potential to contribute to a variety of symptoms. The scope of this article is to present the new molecular techniques for detection of respiratory viruses, and to review new insights into the epidemiology and seasonal appearance of RTIs generated by the new diagnostic tools.",

Owing to the high analytical sensitivity, rapidity, multiplexing capacity and increasing affordability of the new molecular methods, older techniques using virus isolation in cell culture, antigen detection via enzyme immunoassays or immunofluorescence microscopy, and conventional qualitative PCR techniques have in essence become obsolete for everyday clinical practice [1] [2] [3] . However, direct immunofluorescence of specimen smears (direct fluorescent antibody [DFA] ) is still used in some laboratories owing to its specificity, rapidity and cost-effectiveness, but its sensitivity is consistently lower than that offered by most molecular methods [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Virus isolation in cell culture and related techniques may remain important in special situations, for example in order to identify unknown infectious agents, where identification of the SARS corona virus is an important example. Moreover, a clinical isolate provides infectious material that could be used for biological ana lysis, including phenotypic determination of, for example, resistance to antiviral treatment.",

Anti Infect. Ther. 9(8), (2011) energy transfer probes [14] . Each of these probe systems is associated with its own advantages and disadvantages [15, 16] . In-house systems based on real-time PCR utilize a combination of three to six multiplex PCR reactions, with the capacity to assay for 15 or more different respiratory agents in a sample. A reverse transcriptase step prior to PCR is required for the detection of genomes of RNA viruses. The multiplex systems linked with liquid array (i.e., bead-based) can theoretically resolve up to 100 independent channels, whose capacity is only partly utilized in the current commercial systems, managing ana lysis of more than 20 different agents in the same sample. The performance of three such commercial systems were recently compared [17] . A summery of different nucleic acid amplification systems is presented in Table 1 , but readers are referred to recent excellent reviews of the subject for a more comprehensive comparison of available in-house and commercial systems for molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

This is also relevant for disease episodes with a longer duration of symptoms. Thus, the detection frequency Review for enveloped respiratory viruses decreased from more than 51 to 30% for specimens taken from patients within 0-6 versus 7-14 days of symptom duration, respectively [30] . A similar decline in the detection frequency over time has also been observed for RSV [31, 32] . In the study by Brittain-Long et al., a linear increase in threshold cycle (Ct) value dependent on the duration of symptoms was observed for the majority of enveloped respiratory viruses [30] . This suggests a gradual decrease in the amount of virus that was shed even if clinical symptoms remain. In the same study, there was a moderate increase in the Ct value for HRV in the cases that were still PCR-positive after 10 days, indicating that replication during HRV infection declines slowly. This is concordant with the finding that children may shed HRV and HEV from the respiratory mucus for several weeks [33] . Some respiratory viruses, such as bocaviruses, may be shed for several months [34] .",

An obvious risk with a sensitive assay is that a positive result may reflect a clinically irrelevant carriership rather than a symptomatic infection. This risk appears to be limited among adult individuals for most respiratory viruses: all but two (HRV in both cases) specimens from 100 healthy Swedish control subjects were negative for respiratory viruses [30] , and in a similar British study, 2 and 6% of the healthy controls were positive for HRV or IFA, respectively [35] . The observed higher rate of detection of HRV reported for healthy children may represent either truly asymptomatic carriership or, more likely, prolonged postsymptomatic shedding of picornavirus [36] [37] [38] [39] . Thus, a nonsymptomatic status is usually defined by the absence of symptoms up to 1 week before and 1 week after the time for sampling [38] . However, HRV may remain detectable by PCR methods for 2 weeks or more after the onset of symptoms [30] . Immunocompromised individuals may shed detectable amounts of respiratory viruses, for example RSV, in the absence of respiratory symptoms [40, 41] . Moreover, it should be kept in mind that some respiratory viruses, above all HBoV in infected children, may be secreted for several months [34, 42, 43] , and that therefore additional diagnostic measures must be included in these cases to demonstrate an etiological relationship to respiratory symptoms (see section 'Newly discovered respiratory viruses'). In conclusion, quantitative methods, such as real-time PCR, offer additional diagnostic value over nonquantitative methods, because the quantity of the agent detected may aid in distinguishing a true etiological agent from an innocent bystander [27, 44] .",

Second, the quantitative component of the test improves the interpretation of a positive result, not least if several agents are detected and the Ct values of these agents can then be compared [30] . As described in more detail later (see section 'Seasonal distribution of respiratory viruses'), it is clear that the degree of association with respiratory symptoms for individual viruses is variable, where for example, IFA and RSV are more firmly associated with clinical symptoms than many other viruses, suggesting that even low IFA and RSV RNA levels may be of clinical relevance. Sometimes, antigen detection methods, above all direct immunofluorescence techniques (DFA), are considered to be superior to molecular methods because the latter are claimed to be too sensitive [5] . According to this view, highly sensitive molecular methods in general may detect not only higher quantities of viruses that represent a true etiological agent, but also lower, irrelevant, quantities of passenger viruses. However, it appears unlikely that the detection sensitivity of DFA by definition would be able to exactly pinpoint the clinically significant level for each of the 15 or more respiratory agents in all types of patients. By contrast, by virtue of its high detection sensitivity, a quantitative molecular method may be standardized, based on clinical studies, to define individually clinically relevant cutoff levels for adequate laboratory diagnosis, adapted to cope with most of the many combinations of individual agents and different clinical situations induced. However, more clinical studies are required in order to explore the full diagnostic capacity of multiplex quantitative assays. In conclusion, quantitative molecular methods have a great potential to identify a causative viral agent in most cases, provided that sampling from nasopharynx and/or oropharynx is performed early in the course of the disease, when the virus concentration in these compartments is high [11] .",

The advent of multiplex molecular tests, expanding the diagnostic arsenal of assays with the capacity to detect 15-20 different viral agents simultaneously with excellent detection sensitivities, has not only significantly increased the rate of virus detection, but also improved our understanding of the etiology of RTIs. Two important lessons have been learned. First, viruses previously believed to cause exclusively mild upper RTIs, including HRV and HCoV, may be associated with severe disease, affecting the lower respiratory tract [46] [47] [48] . Second, it is more challenging than previously anticipated to make an etiologic diagnosis judging from the clinical presentation [49] [50] [51] . This knowledge combined with the continuously decreasing cost per ana lysis of molecular tests strongly supports increased testing of specimens from patients with respiratory symptoms against a large panel of respiratory viral agents and, in addition, bacteria giving rise to atypical respiratory symptoms, such as C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae.",

Recent data suggest that access to multiplex molecular tests with the capacity to identify 15 respiratory agents may substantially reduce the use of antibiotics [53] , but there are also data suggesting that such antibiotic cost reductions based on intensified molecular diagnostics are not easily achieved [54] .",

IFA is divided into discrete subtypes, designated according to the identity of the hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) envelope glycoprotein genes. Seasonal human influenza viruses during the last 100 years include three subtypes: H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2. A new H1N1 variant transferred from swine to humans was responsible for a pandemic outbreak during 2009 [71] . Cross-species transfers of IFA (above all H5N1) from birds to humans have resulted in severe outbreaks, preferentially in Asia [72] , but the ability of bona fide avian viruses (H4-H16) to spread between humans appears to be limited, owing to different tissue tropisms of human and avian IFA viruses [73, 74] .",

In contrast to IFA, IFB only gives rise to local outbreaks. IFC is rare and associated with mild disease, and is not included in the majority of molecular panels. Most molecular tests do not subtype IFA in the first run; only specimens positive for IFA are subjected to subtyping with respect to the H gene identity. The seasonal IFA virus in the Northern hemisphere temperate zones usually peaks between December and February. The seasonal IFA epidemics vary greatly in intensity. Thus, the IFA season of 2008-2009 in Sweden was much more intense than the two previous seasons in terms of positive specimens submitted to the laboratory [62] , whereas a large German study identified 2002-2003 and 2004-2005 as intense IFA seasons compared with previous seasons from 1997 [28] . In the temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere (35\u00b0S) the seasonal IFA virus usually peaks June-July and is rarely found November-March [75] . In the subtropical parts of Asia, IFA may occur throughout the entire year with sporadic examples of larger outbreaks of seasonal IFA, such as in August-September 2007 and 2008 [76] . The corresponding outbreaks of IFA in an Indian population reached their maxima in June-July in 2007 and 2008, respectively, correlating positively with the rain season [77] . These studies indicate that climate-related factors have a great impact on the timing of the yearly IFA season.",

A similar distribution was found in a Swedish study with specimens collected from 2006 to 2009, although the maximum HCoV-OC43 prevalence occurred somewhat earlier than for HCoV-NL63 [63] . However, the peaks of two major HCoV outbreaks in the Beijing (China) area in 2005 and 2007 occurred in September-October and May-July, respectively [86] . Data from juvenile, as well as adult, patients in Hong Kong over 2 years revealed that HCoV-OC43 peaked in November-December, whereas HCoV-NL63 was frequent in July-October [87, 88] . This is in line with observations for other respiratory viruses (see previously) that the seasonality is strongly dependent on the geographical location.

According to the current taxonomy, HRV no longer forms a genus of its own, but belongs to the genus Enterovirus as three species HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C, each one containing numerous variants, referred to as 'serotypes', 'types' and so on [89] [90] [91] [92] . The original members of the Enterovirus genus now form four species: HEV-A-D belonging to the enlarged Enterovirus genus [91] . HRV are true respiratory viruses and many studies suggest that this agent is the most common cause of common colds, but HRV may also give rise to lower RTIs, as well as exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [44] [45] [46] 68, 90, [93] [94] [95] [96] [97] . HRV is the most prevalent respiratory virus in children under the age of 5 years and the leading cause of hospitalization of children under the age of 2 years with wheezing [93] [94] [95] 98, 99] . Recent clinical studies suggest that HRV-C is found considerably more frequently than anticipated in hospitalized children [100] [101] [102] . Most molecular methods applied do not permit HRV typing. Design of a pan HRV-A, -B and -C real-time PCR method is complicated by sequence variations among the various HRV types that such a test must cover [11,18,28,46].",

HPeVs are genetically and antigenically heterogeneous and circulate in the human population worldwide, preferentially infecting infants and young children [106] . A broadly specific real-time PCR detecting all known HPeV types is now available [26] . Early retrospective studies suggested that HPeV, besides being the cause of gastrointestinal symptoms, may also be the prominent cause of respiratory symptoms [107] . Some recent studies involving molecular methods support a connection between HPeV and respiratory disease [108, 109] , but this conclusion is somewhat obscured by the lack of data regarding possible concomitant infections with other agents. In one larger British study where respiratory specimens were analyzed, it was found that HPeV of types 1 and 6 showed a seasonal patter, peaking in July and August, infecting mainly children below 5 years, and this was most likely not associated with the respiratory disease that brought the children to a physician [110] . It is obvious that further studies are needed to evaluate the potential relationship between HPeV infections and respiratory disease.",

A sensitive realtime quantitative PCR method was recently developed, not only identifying HBoV, but also three other newly discovered enteric bocaviruses, designated HBoV2, HBoV3 and HBoV4 [25] .",

Viremia seems to be an infrequent phenomenon for most other respiratory viruses described previously [121] , only sporadically reported in patients with severe IFA or infants infected with RSV [122, 123] , but even for these two latter situations PCR testing of nasopharynx specimens appears to be adequate for laboratory diagnosis.

This is especially relevant for Review real-time PCR techniques whose combination of a high specificity and wide dynamic range allows the identification of even minor populations of coinfecting viruses. Multiple respiratory viruses have been detected in approximately 10% of the respiratory specimens [46] , with higher rates recorded in young children and immunosuppressed patients. The significance of this finding is uncertain, but infection with multiple viruses has been associated with more severe clinical symptoms [27, 110, 114, 132] . For example, the course of RSV bronchiolitis in infants may be aggravated by coinfection with HRV or HMPV [132] . A similar relationship has been suggested for HBoV, as well as HPeV and classical enteroviruses [110, 114] . However, during the winter season when several respiratory viruses may cause parallel outbreaks, children attending daycare centers can harbor up to four different respiratory viruses simultaneously at different concentrations. Further studies are needed to reveal the clinical implications of such multiple infections, and it is likely that quantification of the relative concentrations of the agents detected by real-time PCR may prove to be useful in the assessment of their clinical significance [11, 27] .",

This has resulted in a new and more detailed picture of the seasonal covariations of at least a dozen of the most frequent viral respiratory agents and, not least, an improved understanding of the clinical significance of infections with multiple agents. One of the most important lessons that can be learned from the past 10 years of multiplex molecular diagnosis of respiratory viruses is that all specimens submitted for laboratory diagnosis of respiratory agents should be assayed for the full panel of respiratory viruses. First, the data accumulated clearly demonstrate that it is extremely difficult to make an etiological diagnosis based on symptoms and other clinical data. Second, viruses previously considered to induce only mild upper RTI symptoms are not seldom associated with more serious lower RTI symptoms. Third, it may be important to identify infections with two or more respiratory viruses because the clinical effects generated by one virus may be amplified by coinfection with another virus.",

Although the supply of different types of commercial molecular tests for viral RTIs are expected to increase, it is reasonable to assume that the in-house tests will be competitive, at least for the larger hospital laboratories, not only for economic reasons. One advantage of in-house tests is that whenever a new infectious agent is detected, it is easy to rapidly develop an in-house molecular test as soon as adequate sequence data are available in GenBank, whereas the development of commercial tests, robust enough to also be used in laboratories lacking necessary experience in diagnostic molecular biology, for obvious reasons is more time consuming. One previous drawback associated with in-house assays -lack of standardization -is now being overcome owing to rapid online publishing of new methods and international standardization networks between university hospital laboratories [134] . Many diagnostic virological laboratories have included assays for bacteria causing RTIs with virus-like symptoms, and it is likely that this development line will continue.",

Sequence ana lysis will probably only be applied to a minority of the specimens, but will be able to tentatively define the 'population respiratory virome' circulating during a RTI season. Obvious advantages associated with NGS sequencing of respiratory specimens are the capacity to discover new respiratory viral agents and the occurrence of chemotherapy-resistant viral variants.",

More studies are needed in order to reveal to what extent coinfection or superinfection with additional respiratory viruses contribute to the clinical picture and to explore whether the quantitative option of real-time PCR can be used to determine the clinical relevance of such multiple infections. Further study should also be conducted to evaluate to what extent a primary infection with one respiratory virus increases (or decreases) the susceptibility to infection by other respiratory agents [136] .",

            "text": "For the surveillance of seasonal respiratory virus infections it is of importance to identify the geographical locations of the long-term sources from which the respiratory virus outbreaks in Review Expert Rev. Anti Infect. Ther. 9(8), (2011) temperate regions are recruited. Genomic and epidemiological dynamics data for IFA suggest a sink-source model of viral ecology, postulating that new viral lineages are seeded from a tropically situated influenza reservoir to the population (sink) in the temperate regions [137] . One important future use of the new molecular methods may be as epidemiological tools to reveal the nature and location of persistent sources of other seasonal respiratory viruses and the routes by which they reach their temperate sink populations. At present, we do not know whether the specific climatology or the high population density of the tropical regions constitute the basis for the IFA source function of this region. Neither do we know whether different seasonal viruses of the temperate regions arise from the same source regions, nor if, for example, RSV and PIV outbreaks originate from different, unique geographical source locations. In addition, we currently know very little about how seasonal outbreaks are influenced by large-scale factors, such as ecological conditions, possible interference between different respiratory viruses in the human population and, not least, natural disasters. There are reasons to believe that the global use of molecular PCR methods for laboratory diagnosis of viral RTIs in parallel with NGS methods for sequencing of selected clinical specimens will be helpful in a 5-year perspective to define not only important respiratory virus sources with respect to the geographical location and the human populations involved, but also the epidemiological mechanisms by which respiratory outbreaks are generated and terminated in the population of temperate regions.",
