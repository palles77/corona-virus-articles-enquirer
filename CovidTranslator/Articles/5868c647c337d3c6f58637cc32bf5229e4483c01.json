This inspired attempts to describe biological regulation schemes with mathematical models 2-5 and to apply electrical circuit analogies to biological pathways 6,7 . Meanwhile, breakthroughs in genomic research and genetic engineering (for example, recombinant DNA technology) were supplying the inventory and methods necessary to physically construct and assemble biomolecular parts. As a result, synthetic biology was born with the broad goal of engineering or 'wiring' biological circuitry -be it genetic, protein, viral, pathway or genomic -for manifesting logical forms of cellular control. Synthetic biology, equipped with the engineering-driven approaches of modularization, rationalization and modelling, has progressed rapidly and generated an ever-increasing suite of genetic devices and biological modules.",

In these two cases, basic transcriptional regulatory elements were designed and assembled to realize the biological equivalents of electronic memory storage and timekeeping (BOX 1). Within the framework provided by these two synthetic systems, biological circuits can be built from smaller, well-defined parts according to model blueprints. They can then be studied and tested in isolation, and their behaviour can be evaluated against model predictions of the system dynamics. This methodology has been applied to the synthetic construction of additional genetic switches 8,10-18 , memory elements 8, 14, 15, 19 and oscillators 9,10,20-23 , as well as to other electronics-inspired genetic devices, including pulse generators 24 , digital logic gates 25-30 , filters 31-33 and communication modules 23, 31, 34, 35 . Now, 10 years after the demonstration of synthetic biology's inaugural devices 8,9 , engineered biomolecular networks are beginning to move into the application stage and yield solutions to many complex societal problems. Although work remains to be done on elucidating biological design principles 36 , this foray into practical applications signals an exciting coming-of-age time for the field.",

These circuits consist of exquisitely tailored sensitive elements that bind analytes and set signaldetection thresholds, and transducer modules that filter the signals and mobilize a cellular response (BOX 2) . The two basic sensing modules must be delicately balanced: this is achieved by programming modularity and specificity into biosensing circuits at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels, as described below. Nature Reviews | Genetics In fact, this was the early design strategy adopted for establishing inducible expression systems [37] [38] [39] [40] . By introducing, removing or modifying activator and repressor sites, a promoter's sensitivity to a molecule can be tuned. Synthetic mammalian transactivation systems are generic versions of this strategy in which an environmentally sensitive transcription factor is fused to a mammalian transactivation domain to cause inducerdependent changes in gene expression. Synthetic mammalian biosensors based on this scheme have been created for sensing signals such as antibiotics [41] [42] [43] , quorum-sensing molecules 44, 45 , gases and metabolites [46] [47] [48] [49] , and temperature changes 50, 51 .

This device is bistable in that it possesses two stable states that can be toggled with the delivery of specified inputs. Upon removal of the input, the circuit retains memory of its current state indefinitely. These forms of memory and state switching have important functions in biology, such as in the differentiation of cells from an initially undifferentiated state. One means by which cellular systems can achieve bistability is through genetic mutual repression. The natural P R -P RM genetic switch from bacteriophage \u03bb, which uses this network architecture to govern the lysis-lysogeny decision, consists of two promoters that are each repressed by the gene product of the other (that is, by the Cro and CI repressor proteins). The genetic toggle switch 8 constructed by our research group is a synthetically engineered version of this co-repressed gene regulation scheme. In one version of the genetic toggle, the P L promoter from \u03bb phage was used to drive transcription of lacI, the product of which represses a second promoter, Ptrc2 (a lac promoter variant). Conversely, Ptrc2 drives expression of a gene (cI-ts) encoding the temperaturesensitive (ts) \u03bb CI repressor protein, which inhibits the P L promoter. The activity of the circuit is monitored through the expression of a GFP promoter.",

Achieving true modularity with genetic parts is inherently difficult because of unintended interference among native and synthetic parts and therefore requires careful decoupling of functional modules. one such modular design strategy was used by Kobayashi et al. 34 to develop whole-cell E. coli biosensors that respond to signals in a programmable fashion. In this design, a sensory module (that is, an environment-responsive promoter and associated transcription factor) was coupled to an engineered gene circuit that functions like a central processing unit. E. coli cells were programmed to respond to a deleterious endogenous input -specifically, DNA-damaging stimuli, such as ultraviolet radiation or mitomycin C. The gene circuit, which was chosen to be the toggle switch (BOX 1) , processes the incoming sensory information and flips from an 'oFF' to an 'oN' state when a signal threshold is exceeded. Because the biosensor has a decoupled, modular nature, it can be wired to any desired output, from the expression of a standard fluorescent reporter to the activation of natural phenotypes, such as biofilm formation (for example, through expression of traA) or cell suicide (for example, through expression of ccdB).",

In the example shown, a transcriptional AND gate was designed to sense and report only the simultaneous presence of two environmental signals (for example, salicylate and arabinose) 25 . At one gate input, the researchers encoded an environment-responsive promoter (for example, P BAD ) that activates transcription of a T7 RNA polymerase gene in response to a single environmental signal (for example, arabinose). The gene, however, carries internally encoded amber stop codons (red spiked circles) that function to block translation of its transcript. Activation of the second gate input is the key to unlocking translation; specifically, translation can be induced when a second promoter (for example, P sal ) activates transcription of the supD amber suppressor tRNA in response to a second unique signal (for example, salicylate). In other words, only when the two environmental signals are simultaneously present can the T7 RNA polymerase be faithfully expressed and used to activate an output T7 promoter. This is an example of how sophisticated specificity can be programmed into a transducer module by creatively linking the sensory information of multiple sensitive elements. Furthermore, the design is transcriptionally modular in that different sets of environment-responsive promoters can be interfaced to the AND gate.",

Non-coding rNAs can splice and edit rNA, modify ribosomal rNA, catalyse biochemical reactions and regulate gene expression at the level of transcription or translation [53] [54] [55] [56] . The regulatory subset of non-coding rNAs 57-59 is well-suited for rational design 60 and, in particular, for biosensing applications. Many regulatory rNA molecules are natural environmental sensors [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] , and because of their ability to take on complex structures defined by their sequence, these molecules can mediate diverse modular functions across distinct sequence domains. riboswitches 70 , for instance, bind specific small-molecule ligands through aptamer domains and induce conformational changes in the 5\u2032 uTr of their own mrNA, thereby regulating gene expression.

Binding of the aptamer to its ligand (for example, the small molecule theophylline) induces a conformational change in the rNA sensor that either sequesters the antisense domain in a stable stem loop (oN switch) or liberates it to inhibit translation of an output gene reporter (oFF switch). As a result of the cooperative dependence on both ligand and target mrNA, this biosensor shows binary-like switching at a threshold ligand concentration, similar to the genetic toggle design. Importantly, this detection threshold can be adjusted by altering the rNA sequence and therefore the thermodynamic properties of the structure. In principle, the 'antiswitch' framework is modular; in other words, aptamers for different ligands and antisense stems targeting different downstream genes could be incorporated into the scaffold to create new sensors. In practice, developing new sensors by aptamer and antisense replacement often involves re-screening compatible secondary structures to create functioning switches. In the future, this platform could be combined with rapid, in vitro aptameric selection techniques [72] [73] [74] [75] for generating a suite of rNA biosensors that report on the levels of various mrNA species and metabolites in a cell. However, here it should also be noted that aptamers show specificity for a biased ligand space, and as a result aptamers for a target ligand cannot always be found.",

Such drugs include the antimalaria drug artemisinin and the anticancer drug taxol. Fortunately, global access to drugs is being enabled by hybrid synthetic biology and metabolic engineering strategies for the microbial production of rare natural products. In the case of artemisinin (part c), there exist two biosynthetic pathways for the synthesis of the universal precursors to all isoprenoids, the large and diverse family of natural products of which artemisinin is a member. The native isoprenoid pathway found in Escherichia coli (the deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) pathway) has been difficult to optimize, so instead researchers have synthetically constructed and tested the entire Saccharomyces cerevisiae mevalonate-dependent (MEV) pathway in E. coli in a piece-wise fashion (for example, by separating the 'top' and 'bottom' operons). The researchers initially used E. coli as a simple, orthogonal host platform to construct, debug and optimize the large metabolic pathway 105 . They then linked the optimized heterologous pathway to a codon-optimized form of the plant terpene synthase ADS to funnel metabolic production to the specific terpene precursor to artemisinin. This work allowed them to build a full, optimized solution that could be ultimately and seamlessly deployed back into S. cerevisiae for cost-effective synthesis and purification of industrial quantities of the immediate drug precursor of artemisinin 106 .

This strategy was used to give mechanistic insights into a primary immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinaemia, in which patients cannot generate mature B cells and as a result are unable to properly fight infections 83 . The researchers developed a synthetic testbed by systematically reconstructing the various components of the human B cell antigen receptor (BCr) signalling pathway in an orthogonal environment. This allowed them to identify network topology features that trigger BCr signalling and assembly. A rare mutation in the immunoglobulin-\u03b2-encoding gene was identified in one patient and introduced into the synthetic system, in which it was shown to abolish assembly of the BCr on the cell surface, thereby linking this faulty pathway component with disease onset. Pathogenic viral genomes can similarly be reconstructed for studying the molecular underpinnings of infectious disease pandemics.

Translational repression of this cisrepressed mrNA can be alleviated by an independently regulated transactivating rNA that targets the stem-loop for unfolding. engineered riboregulators have been used to tightly regulate the expression of CcdB, a toxic bacterial protein that inhibits DNA gyrase, to gain a better understanding of the sequence of events leading to induced bacterial cell death 87 . These synthetic biology studies, in conjunction with systems biology studies of quinolones (antibiotics that inhibit gyrase) 87 , led to the discovery that all major classes of bactericidal antibiotics induce a common cellular death pathway by stimulating oxidative damage 88, 89 .

Normal p53 production would result in inhibition of a crucial viral replication component, whereas a defunct p53 pathway, which is characteristic of tumour cells, would allow viral replication and cell killing. In another demonstration of translational synthetic biology applied to cancer therapy, voigt and colleagues 94 developed cancer-targeting bacteria and linked their ability to invade the cancer cells to specific environmental signals. Constitutive expression of the heterologous invasin (inv) gene (from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis) can induce E. coli cells to invade both normal human cell lines and cancer cell lines. So, to preferentially invade cancer cells, the researchers placed inv under the control of transcriptional operons that are activated by environmental signals specific to the tumour microenvironment. These engineered bacteria could be made to carry or synthesize cancer therapies for the treatment of tumours.",

Glucocorticoid secretion, for instance, has a circadian and ultradian pattern of release, with important transcriptional consequences for glucocorticoid-responsive cells 95 . Faithfully mimicking these patterns in the administration of synthetic hormones to patients with glucocorticoid-responsive diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, may decrease known side effects and improve therapeutic response 95 . Periodic synthesis and release of biologic drugs can be autonomously achieved with synthetic oscillator circuits 9,10,20-22 or programmed time-delay circuits 96 .

Using the heterologous mevalonate-dependent (MEV) pathway in E. coli as a model, they combinatorially (albeit, at a substantially smaller scale) optimized the stoichiometry of the three enzymes responsible for producing mevalonate from acetyl-CoA. Finally, they showed that the optimized synthetic scaffold could substantially increase product titre while reducing the metabolic load on the host; in other words, their high product titres did not require the overexpression of biosynthetic enzymes in the cell.",

Wiring these modules together to bring about reliable, higher-order functionality is one of the next major goals of synthetic biology 113 , and an important application of this objective is the layering of 'smart' control mechanisms over metabolic engineering. For instance, circuits designed to sense the bioreactor environment and shift metabolic phases accordingly would further improve biofuel production. Alternatively, autonomous timing circuits could be used to shut down metabolic processes after a prescribed duration of time. Biological timers of this sort have been developed using genetic toggle switches that were deliberately rendered imbalanced through model-guided promoter engineering 112 . These genetic timers were used to program the time-dependent flocculation of yeast cells to facilitate the separation of cells from, for instance, the alcohol produced in industrial fermentation processes.",

This is particularly important in the production of recombinant proteins, bioplastics and other large biomaterials, which can accumulate inside cells, cause the formation of inclusion bodies and become toxic to cells if they are present at high titres. To export recombinant spider-silk monomers, Widmaier et al. 115 searched for a secretion system that would enable efficient and indiscriminate secretion of proteins through both bacterial membranes. The Salmonella type III secretion system (T3SS) not only fulfils these criteria but also possesses a natural regulatory scheme that ties expression of the protein to be secreted to the secretion capacity of the cell; as a result, the desired protein is only expressed when sufficient secretion complexes have been built. To obtain superior secretion rates of recombinant silk protein, the researchers needed only to engineer a control circuit that hitches the heterologous silk-protein-producing genes to the innate genetic machinery for environmental sensing and secretion commitment.",

Weiss and colleagues 24, 31 have similarly done pioneering work in building biomolecular signalprocessing architectures that can filter communication signals originating from 'sender' cells.

            "text": "treatment and deliveryPart b shows a synthetic mammalian genetic switch for tight, tunable and reversible control of a desired gene for therapeutic or gene-delivery applications. In the OFF configuration (upper panel), expression of the gene of interest (green) is repressed at the levels of both transcription and translation. Constitutively expressed LacI repressor (red) binds to the lac operator sites in the transgene module of the gene of interest, therefore repressing its transcription. Any transcriptional leakage is repressed at the level of translation by an interfering RNA (blue), which targets the gene's 3\u2032 UTR. The system is switched ON (lower panel) by the addition of isopropyl-\u03b2-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), which binds LacI repressor proteins and consequently relieves both forms of repression.",
