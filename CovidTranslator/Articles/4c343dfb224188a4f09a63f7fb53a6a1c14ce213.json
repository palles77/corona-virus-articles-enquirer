            "text": "PCR assays have markedly improved the diagnosis of Human Rhinoviruses (HRV) infections by increasing sensitivity in comparison to traditional cell culture [1] ; however, many RT-PCR protocols still are time-consuming. Real-time PCR assays have resulted in improving virus detection and quantification [2] . Rapidity and quantitative results represent important advantages in the diagnostic workup of HRV infection and could be of relevance considering the future potential availability of antiviral agents. Human rhinoviruses are the most common viral agents in humans, being the over 110 serologic types responsible for about 30-50% of all the cases of common colds and associated upper respiratory tract complications in both adults and children. Although HRV are generally temperature restricted in replication with optimal growth at 33-35\u00b0C, the temperatures observed in the tracheobronchial tree are often lower than body core temperatures, also in relation to external temperature and frequency of ventilation, and so are permissive for HRV replication [3] . Moreover, it has been evidenced that many HRV serotypes can replicate efficiently at core body temperature with modest differences in terms of infectious titres (\\0.5-1.0 log 10 TCID 50 ) [4] . Indeed, several studies have linked HRV infection to illnesses in the lower respiratory tract in immunocompetent patients, including exacerbations of preexisting airways disease in those with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or cystic fibrosis, and pneumonia and bronchiolitis in children aged \\5 years hospitalized for HRV infection [5] . However, a recent study on hospitalized adults with pulmonary disease found a prevalence of HRV in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens of 31.2% without evidencing a significant difference of prevalence in relation to the presence of COPD, pneumonia or acute respiratory illness [6] . In contrast to immunocompetent subjects, HRV clearance in immunocompromised patients may be delayed with prolonged shedding leading to the onset of life-threatening conditions and chronic infections [7] [8] [9] . Evidence demonstrating that HRV disease is not exclusively limited to the upper airways and may cause lower respiratory complications, together with the frequency of HRV infections and the increasing number of immunocompromised patients, underline the need for including HRV in virological diagnostics of acute lower respiratory tract illness. However, not many laboratories and institutions have adopted HRV diagnostics in the routine clinical use, and limited informations are available on HRV clinical impact in comparison with that of other respiratory viruses.",

The efficiency of viral RNA detection from clinical samples and the possible presence of polymerase inhibitors were monitored by using internal control, as described in the section 'Materials and Methods.' These controls permitted appropriate correction in the calculation of viral copy numbers. For the quantification of viral load, the slope (s) and the y-axis intercept (Y) (the y-axis intercept is the point at which the standard curve intersects with the ordinate; it indicates the theoretical detection limit of the reaction by revealing the Ct expected in the presence of a single target molecule in the sample) of the corresponding standard curve and the Ct of the target virus amplification were used according to the following equation: Po = Inverse log(Ct -Y/s), where Po is the number of virus copy equivalents in the PCR prior to amplification. Results of HRV quantification are summarized in Table 3 . Briefly, HRV was positive in 12/110 (10.9%) BAL specimens, obtained from as many patients (12/84, 14.3%): in particular 11/87 (12.6%) samples from immunocompromised patients and 1/23 (4.4%) samples from immunocompetent patients (P = n.s.).

            "text": "This raticle describes the development of an in-house RT real-time PCR assay for quantification of HRV RNA in clinical samples. Real-time PCR assays are described as 'closed' systems, as no post-amplification manipulation of the amplicon is required. The advantages of these systems include a reduced turnaround time, minimisation of the potential for carry-over contamination and ability to closely scrutinise the assay performance, thus representing a suitable tool for routine diagnostics in virology. The use of an external standard curve for quantification relies upon titration of an identically amplified template, in a related sample matrix, within the same experimental run. However, this approach may suffer from uncontrolled and unmonitored inter-tube variations and thus such experiments should be described as semi-quantitative. Despite this sub-optimal approach, fluorescence data are generally collected from PCR cycles that span the linear amplification portion of the reaction where the fluorescent signal and the accumulating DNA are proportional. Because the emissions from fluorescent chemistries are temperature dependent, data are generally acquired only once per cycle at the same temperature in order to monitor amplicon yield [12] . Then, the Ct of the sample at a specific fluorescence value can be compared with similar data collected from a series of standards by the calculation of a standard curve. The determination of the Ct depends upon the sensitivity and ability of the instrument to discriminate specific fluorescence from background noise, concentration and nature of the fluorescence-generating component and amount of template initially present. Real-time PCR offers significant improvements to viral load quantification because of its wide dynamic range that can accommodate at least eight log10 copies of nucleic acid template [13] [14] [15] . This is made possible because data are chosen from the linear phase of amplification where conditions are optimal, rather than the end-point where the final amount of amplicon could be affected by inhibitors, poorly optimised reaction conditions or saturation by inhibitory PCR by-products and double-stranded amplicon. The result of taking data from the end-point is that there may exist no relationship between the initial template and final amplicon concentrations. Real-time PCR for the study of viral load presents a lower inter-and intra-assay variability in comparison to conventional PCR [13, 14] and an equivalent or higher analytical sensitivity in comparison to traditional viral culture, or conventional single-round, and nested PCR [16] . Indeed, PCR methods have significantly improved the diagnosis of HRV infection. However, these reports could be an over-estimate due to the choice of smaller targets, which amplify more efficiently, or due to the use of different or improved primers for the real-time assays as the use of software to design optimised primers and oligoprobes is more common. When increased sensitivity and broad dynamic range are combined, it is possible to quantify template from samples containing a wide range of concentrations, as in clinical specimens. This avoids the need for dilution of the amplicon prior to conventional detection or repetition of the assay using a diluted sample because the first result falls outside the detection limits. The performance of the RT real-time PCR developed in this study was examined over different concentrations of HRV RNA and it was found to be very sensitive with a minimum cut-off for detection of 10 0 copy/reaction and was linear up to 10 1 copies. The sensitivity, defined as the lowest concentration of HRV RNA quantified at a frequency of 100%, was found to be 10 0 copies/reaction. The assay reproducibility was high with a median inter-assay variability and intra-assay variability of 1.116% (range 0.785-1.699%) and 0.553% (range 0.088-0.671%), respectively, thus being superior to that obtained in other studies [17] .",

Although prevalence of infection tended to be higher in specimens obtained from immunocompromised patients, the difference did not reach the statistical significance, as well as no significant association with a discharge diagnosis was found. Regarding this, it has to be taken into account that all of our specimens, but one, presented a coinfection with at least another respiratory virus (including herpesviruses HSV, EBV, CMV, HHV-6 and -7, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus, human bocavirus, parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses, adenoviruses, RSV)(data not shown). HRV shedding in the immunocompromised host could be prolonged in comparison to the immunocompetent one, thus leading to the onset of severe complications, as well as it has been suggested an association with acute rejection in lung transplant recipients [7] . In our study, multiple sampling was available in particular for lung transplant recipients, however no repeated positivity was found, thus preventing the possibility to evaluate this issue and suggesting the need for further studies. Similarly, no significant association was found with the occurrence of exacerbation of pre-existing bronchopneumopaties. As the association between acute exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and respiratory viral pathogens, particularly HRV, is well recognized [19] [20] [21] , the lack of association found in our study could be due to the small number, thus preventing us to evaluate this issue.",
