We compare performance of a range of commercially available ion exchange media, including what we believe to be the first published use of a novel media for adenovirus purification (NatriFlo \u00d2 HD-Q, Merck).

It is also unsuited to the development of 'niche' vaccines for diseases with small commercial markets-for example human diseases which are significant problems only within a restricted geographical area, livestock diseases predominantly affecting low-income countries, or even 'personalized' cancer vaccines. In contrast 'platform technologies' for subunit vaccines allow the application of a single vaccine production method to the induction of immune responses against any protein antigen of interest. A key group of such 'platforms' are viral vector vaccines, which use a replication-deficient virus to deliver a transgene encoding the antigen of interest for expression in the recipient's cells. In principle, manufacture of such vectors should be similar regardless of the encoded antigen.",

Viruses lacking E1 and E3 regions are replication-incompetent outside helper cells and a high level of assurance against the generation of replication-competent virus can be achieved [3, 4] . Pre-existing immunity to human adenoviruses in the human population may inhibit their effectiveness as vaccine vectors but can be overcome using simian adenoviruses. These have been shown to be safe and to have excellent immunogenicity in various human populations, including African children and adults, without any patient selection on the basis of preexisting anti-vector immunity [5, 6] . Rare human serotypes may have similar properties [7, 8] . As a result, there has been significant investment by large pharmaceutical companies in the development of high-yielding and cost-effective large-scale adenovirus production processes [4] . An adenovirus-vectored vaccine against Ebola has been licensed in China [9] and numerous candidates are in clinical trials and advanced pre-clinical development, targeting diseases including malaria, Middle East respiratory syndrome, respiratory syncytial virus and a variety of cancers [10] .",

Unfortunately however, such cell lines have not been widely accessible for GMP manufacture in suspension culture.

We selected vectors encoding a variety of transgenes: 'ChAdOx1 RVF' encoding the GnGc antigen of Rift Valley fever virus (RVF) [24] ; 'ChAdOx2 RabG' encoding rabies virus glycoprotein [22] , and 'ChAd63 ME-TRAP' encoding a previously described malaria antigen [23] . We examined virus yield over time in HEK293 T-rex cells in small-scale shake flasks (maximum culture volume 40 mL), comparing MOIs of 3 and 10. Cell density was 1.5 \u00c2 10 6 cells/mL at the time of infection, reduced to 0.6 \u00c2 10 6 cells/mL by addition of a 1.5 volume feed 3 h after infection. Our aim was not to determine strictly optimal conditions (which would require a wider range of MOIs and cell densities), but instead to assess whether we could identify 'standard' conditions providing acceptable yields. Previous work suggests cell-specific productivity is reduced at cell densities above those we tested unless more complex medium-exchange or perfusion methods are used [11] . Given our aim to develop a simple and transferable method, we restricted ourselves to lower cell densities and simply sought to establish a readily-achieved window of densities achieving acceptable yield.",

The resulting process should be suitable for adoption by any facility with competence in routine bioprocess procedures (mammalian cell culture, bioreactor batch processes, tangential flow filtration and chromatography).

Pharmaceutical-grade Benzonase \u00d2 at this concentration costs c. USD 150 per liter, or c. USD 0.15 per vaccine dose.

Nonetheless our data ( Fig. 2A) suggest that, if scaling up this process, the concentration of Benzonase \u00d2 used, or the digestion time, could be considerably reduced while maintaining acceptable host cell DNA levels and without requiring any other change to the method. The conditions we used reduced host cell DNA to beneath regulatorily-accepted levels of 10 ng per human dose prior to clarification; a considerably higher level at this stage would be expected to be reduced within acceptable limits by the downstream process.",

Such capacities have clear beneficial implications for process scalability and cost-effectiveness; Mustang Q units are available with bed volumes up to 780 mL, which our data suggests would be adequate for purification of nearly a million human doses. We observed slightly different elution characteristics for the three tested serotypes. Although the salt concentration required to elute various adenovirus serotypes from anion exchange media has previously been reported to correlate with charge of the hexon, the major capsid protein [36] , we did not observe such a pattern. At pH 7, predicted hexon net charges are \u00c017.7 for ChAdOx2, \u00c018.5 A 260 data was also collected, with results paralleling the A 280 data, but is omitted from graphs for clarity.In panels A-I, each column of graphs represents data from a single type of media, as per column captions. Panels A-F show chromatograms from experiments in which previously purified ChAdOx2 RabG was loaded on Mustang Q Acrodisc, NatriFlo \u00d2 HD-Q Recon Mini, and CIM-QA 1 mL capsules. In panels A-C. breakthrough was observed and hence dynamic binding capacity was calculated for the Mustang Q and NatriFlo \u00d2 capsules; breakthrough was not observed after loading 4x10 13 VP on the (larger) CIM-QA column. Panels D-F show the continuations of the above experiments, in which virus was eluted using a linear gradient of increasing conductivity to allow estimation of elution conditions; the conductivity at the peak of virus elution is shown. Panels G-I show chromatograms from experiments in which diafiltered lysate containing ChAdOx2 RabG was loaded on Mustang Q Acrodisc, NatriFlo \u00d2 HD-Q Recon Mini, and CIM-QA 1 mL capsules, followed by step elution.Panel J presents DBC, virus recovery and HCP reduction data from the experiments shown in Panels A-F. In the case of the CIM-QA column, breakthrough was not reached despite loading 3x10 13 VP on the 1 mL device.Panels K-L show chromatograms from experiments in which previously purified ChAd63 ME-TRAP and ChAdOx1 RVF were loaded on Mustang Q Acrodisc capsules and eluted with a linear conductivity gradient, as above.",

The report correlating elution characteristics with charge found this relationship when comparing viruses with hexon charge spanning the range \u00c014 to \u00c028, while the relationship was imperfect when comparing viruses with smaller differences. It may be that chromatographic differences between viruses sharing similar hexon charges are attributable to differing charges on other structural proteins. The serotypes we tested are representative of the diversity of major structural protein (hexon and fiber) sequences within adenovirus species E [25] . It would be of interest to extend the use of this process to clinically relevant serotypes of other adenovirus species. Encouraging such work, there are several reports of the application of TFF- In each case, loading occurs over the first $ 600 mL (a degree of A 280 deflection from impurity flow-through is visible) and the largest A 280 peak represents the eluted virus which was collected. Note for ChAdOx2 RabG that the pre-elution wash and the post-elution high-salt wash produce relatively small A 280 peaks (predominantly impurity, with some virus, as assessed by SDS-PAGE); this data was obtained using UV and conductivity sensors of the Akta Purifier. For ChAd63 and ChAdOx1, data was obtained using the complete single-use chromatography rig (i.e. with single-use UV and conductivity sensors [Pendotech]) and no post-elution wash was performed. For ChAd63, due to the lower conductivity at which this vaccine eluted, no pre-elution wash was used.Panel C shows samples from each stage of the downstream process on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel. Samples shown are from a single process run with the ChAdOx2 RabG vaccine, but are typical of runs with all three investigated vaccines. and anion-exchange-based downstream processes to the species B adenovirus AdHu35 and the species C virus AdHu5 [37] , and anion exchange has also been successfully applied to species D viruses [36] . Given that residual host cell protein levels were within acceptable limits after single-step chromatography, we did not require or explore a 'polish' step (although we note the possibility of use of core-shell octylamine resins (such as Captocore 700 [GE] ) to provide such a polish in flow-through mode [16] ). Our downstream process is thus strikingly straightforward and accessible to any GMP facility with minimal equipment investment: the only requirements are peristaltic pumps and the Pendotech sensor monitoring apparatus (total one-off cost < USD 30,000). Our final process provided USP yields consistently > 2500 doses per litre. Yield per infected cell ranged from 5.5 \u00c2 10 4 -1.4 \u00c2 10 5 VP, favourably comparable to values previously reported in a review encompassing a variety of cell types, media, and process types (HEK293 and PER.C6; adherent and suspension; batch, fed batch and perfusion) [11] , and also comparable also to those achieved in more recent perfusion-based processes using PER.C6 cells [12] . Overall DSP recovery was in some cases as low as 20%, offering clear scope for further improvement in the overall process yield; analysis of step recovery from individual runs indicated particular potential for improvement of the ChAdOx1 RVF IEX step and the consistency of performance of the TFF2 step. Nonetheless, final yields were consistently more than adequate for early-phase clinical trials.",

Given one to two weeks, it is possible to perform a shake flask study to confirm optimal time of harvest, and a small-scale gradient-elution anion exchange experiment to confirm suitable chromatography elution +/-wash conditions. Among vaccines of a single adenovirus serotype, however, transgene repression should minimize differences in growth kinetics, and chromatographic characteristics are believed to be determined by the (constant) structural proteins rather than the (varying) transgene [36] . It is likely that conditions pre-established to be suitable for a given serotype (i.e. for ChA-dOx2, ChAdOx1 and ChAd63, those conditions used here) will be applicable regardless of the transgene-and hence even those simple optimization experiments may not be necessary to assure satisfactory yields for early-phase clinical trials. The key rate-limiting step in the production of GMP adenovirus in the outbreak-response context is now the rescue of virus and production of a suitable inoculum (c. 2 \u00c2 10 10 IU) to initiate a process such as ours. Ongoing work in our Institute aims to address this issue.",

Each column of graphs represents a different serotype (as indicated by column captions), and each row a different measured parameter (as indicated by row captions: virus particle titer, assayed by qPCR; infectious unit titer; and viable cell density respectively). Each parameter was measured at multiple timepoints after infection. Blue lines indicate MOI of 3; red lines indicate MOI of 10. Solid lines and filled symbols indicate cell-associated virus [assays using cell pellets]; dashed lines and open symbols, where present, indicate virus in supernatant. Points and error bars indicate the median and range of two independent flasks within an experiment; absence of a visible error bar indicates close inter-replicate agreement. For each flask the plotted results are the mean of triplicate qPCR measurements and duplicate infectivity titers. Results are representative of two independent experiments for ChAdOx2 and ChAd63. In the case of ChAdOx1, a second experiment performed using a different transgene insert (a different viral glycoprotein) also gave similar results (data not shown). DNA lysis and clarification. Panel A shows kinetic of host cell DNA reduction, as measured by qPCR, during cell lysis in the presence of 60 U/mL Benzonase \u00d2 . Data shown is the mean (points) and range (error bars, if range large enough to render them visible) of duplicate samples. The result for each sample was itself the mean of triplicate assay wells. Panel B shows comparison of five depth filters (indicated by annotation on the graph) on the basis of the relationship of filtrate turbidity versus cumulative throughput. The same cell lysate, with a pre-filtration turbidity of 70 NTU, was passed through each filter. Initial filtrate measurements obtained with Millistak+ \u00d2 CE50, Clarisolve \u00d2 CS60HX and Clarisolve \u00d2 CS20MS filters were clearly inferior to those with Millistak+ \u00d2 HC Pro C0SP and so these were not evaluated beyond the initial filtrate sample collection.",

All calculations were based upon viral genome qPCR, with the exception of recovery after sterile filtration which is based upon spectrophotometry (as there is no change in buffer composition at this point). qPCR-based results are the means of results obtained from three replicate samples, with three replicate qPCR reactions per sample. All calculations were based upon comparisons made within a single qPCR run. Apparent recoveries in excess of 100% reflect residual qPCR assay variability. The qPCR-based results presented for TFF2 recovery were produced by comparing samples taken prior to TFF2 and from the final product (after TFF2 and sterile filtration), on the basis that product loss upon sterile filtration typically reflects aggregation as a result of poor performance of the TFF2 process. Summary results are presented as medians with ranges in brackets, and are broken down by device type for TFF2 (excluding the single run performed using a Pellicon XL50 unit).",
