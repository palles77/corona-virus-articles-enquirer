In this type of immune response the deposition of macrophages and virus-antibody complexes around small venules leads to a pyogranulomatous vasculitis that is responsible for the formation of effusions typical of wet FIP. If a strong cell-mediated immune response develops in the early stage of the infection, virus replication could be lowered and infection can be limited or successfully cleared with no evidence of clinical signs. Conversely, if the cell-mediated response is weak and unable to reduce virus replication an intermediate response can also occur with a continuous release of virokines and chemokines that recruit neutrophils and macrophages into infection sites. This leads to the formation of pyogranulomas, typical of dry FIP. Dry FIP may also become effusive in the terminal stage of the disease when the immune system collapses. Thus, the development of FIP depends on the balance between humoral and cellular immune response (Pedersen, 2009 ). The cytokine interferon-g (IFN-g) is one of the main modulators of cell mediated immunity (Berg et al., 2005) . IFN-g shifts the immune response from T-helper 2 to T-helper 1 with a consequent enhancement of immune cytotoxic activity due to the activation of macrophages and CD8+ T cells. This type of immunity can protect the host against the development of the disease or even more against the infection (Pedersen, 2009) .",

The analysis of data distribution reported in Fig. 1 , however, reveals that the median values were lower than P0 with all the peptides but with some of them the individual variability was extremely high and characterized by the presence of outliers (e.g. peptides P5 and P8) or of a very wide distribution range. For example, it is interesting to note that, contrarily to that recorded for the other peptides, the distribution range observed with P7 was wider than in samples treated with the sham solution. This can be explained by the fact that in 3/5 cats IFN-g concentration was higher than the one observed in the control wells (see also Table 3 ). The analysis of individual data shows that values higher than P0 were also recorded in all the samples from cat #10 and, occasionally in other cats, mostly in the case of incubation with peptides from ''mixed'' or ''avirulent'' strains (e.g. P3, P5, and P8).",

All these findings support the hypothesis that the development of FIP depends on a specific FCoVhost interaction, mostly based on cell-mediated immunity (Pedersen, 1987 (Pedersen, , 2009 . In turn, the strength of the immune response could be influenced by viral epitopes, since immune-modulating sequences have been found in the FCoV genome (Zhao et al., 2007) .

Specifically, peptides corresponding to the residues 14, 182, 198 of protein N of FCoVs were selected using a bioinformatic approach. Immunomic tools have been largely applied in several species (De Groot et al., 2003; D\u00edaz et al., 2009 ), but not in cats. Thus, in this study, epitope mapping algorithms designed for human and mouse were used since the sequence analysis of feline MHC class I reveals a remarkable conservation of both nucleotide sequence and functional organization with human and mouse MHC loci (Yuhki et al., 1989) . Obviously, a more classical approach using overlapping peptides from the N protein would have provided a more exhaustive determination of T-cell epitopes. However, the bioinformatic approach allowed us to save time and resources by selecting only those peptides with a high probability to be immunologically relevant.",

Unfortunately we do not have information about the IFN-g concentration in the plasma of 6 cats, 5 of which had high level of IFN-g in P0. Thus, we cannot definitely conclude whether this high level in P0 was due to an even higher concentration of IFNg in plasma (suggesting that cat #2 was hyper-responsive) or if their plasma values were normal (suggesting that in the majority of cats, including cat #2, the simple incubation activates IFN-g production). The first hypothesis, however, is more likely, based on the results from cats in which both plasma and P0 values were analyzed and on RT-PCR results, that were negative in 3 out of 4 P0 samples consistently with that reported in a previous study (Gelain et al., 2006) on incubation of feline whole blood.",

Also this hypothesis is supported by PCR results of P0 samples. Thus, the protocol used in this study maintains an acceptable level of IFN-g on resting cells without stimulating IFN-g production, thus allowing for the investigation of IFN-g responses to FCoV peptides. This comparison, however, was biased by the low number of observations and by the individual variability of IFN-g responses, which did not allow for the detection of significant changes despite evident differences in mean values. It is thus not possible to draw definitive conclusions on the effect of potentially immunogenic peptides. Nevertheless in most cases the incubation with peptides further decreased the concentration of IFN-g compared with P0, especially after incubation with the peptides designed around residues 14 and 182 and with the peptide designed on the ''virulent'' sequence around residue 198. Moreover, in this case, the decreased IFN-g concentration could be due to the degradation of pre-existing IFN-g (possibly induced by the peptides itself) not associated with an equivalent IFN-g production since RT-PCR did not suggest an increased mRNA expression compared with P0 after incubation with most of these peptides. Conversely, both the concentration of IFN-g and mRNA expression increased in individual cats, especially after incubation with peptides designed on the basis of ''avirulent'' or ''mixed'' sequences of the residue 198 peptide. As regards to the ELISA testing, however, the possible presence of a previous priming of the cells is very likely, since ''hyper-responsive'' cats were mostly found among cats with chronic diseases potentially stimulating the immune system.",

The preliminary results about the responses to FCoV peptides are encouraging but further investigations on the possible role of protein N immunostimulating epitopes. Specifically, although biased by the low number of observations and by the high individual variability, these results suggest that some sequences of FCoV protein N from ''avirulent'' or ''mixed'' strains can stimulate cell-mediated immunity, especially in cats in which cell-mediated immunity is primed by chronic diseases. Future larger studies are required to confirm the possible role of FCoV itself in stimulating the production of IFN-g, the key cytokine of cell-mediated immunity involved in the response against FCoVs and consequently responsible of viral persistence (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2003; Foley et al., 2003; Kiss et al., 2004; Berg et al., 2005; Gelain et al., 2006; Giordano and Paltrinieri, 2009 ).",
