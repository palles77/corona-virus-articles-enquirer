The central features of the approach are the ability to select SNPs at will for detection, and the absence of need to PCR amplify the target. A surprisingly long probe length (39-49 nt) was needed for allelic discrimination. Reconstitution experiments demonstrate linearity of ASE over a broad range. Using this approach, we have discovered at least two novel imprinted genes, NLRP2, which encodes a member of the inflammasome, and OSBPL1A, which encodes a presumed oxysterol-binding protein, were both preferentially expressed from the maternal allele. In contrast, ERAP2, which encodes an aminopeptidase, did not show preferential parent-of-origin expression, but rather, cis-acting nonimprinted differential allelic control. The approach is scalable to the whole genome and can be used for discovery of functional epigenetic modifications in patient samples.",

Wholegenome studies of the epigenome, or nonsequence-based information inherited during cell division, has lagged behind. Part of the reason is the diverse nature of epigenetic control elements, such as DNA methylation and multiple chromatin modifications. Standard array-based allele-indiscriminate gene expression analysis may reveal epigenetic changes at individual genes, or may simply reflect dynamic changes in gene expression mediated by trans-acting regulatory components such as transcription factors. The ability to discriminate allele-specific expression (ASE) of the two alleles of genes can reveal changes in epigenetic control, since the two alleles are affected by the same transcription factors, yet would differ in cis-acting control elements.",

In the other, 1983 heterozygous SNPs were examined using PCR amplification of each target sequence (Pant et al. 2006) , using the criteria that SNPs must be at a single location in the human genome and at least 25 bp away from any exon/ intron boundary. Both studies showed a surprisingly high frequency of ASE, affecting 54% or 53% of genes, respectively. Another recent report found that 300 out of 4000 genes (\u223c8%) acquired stochastic monoallelic expression on subcloning lymphoblastoid cell lines (Gimelbrant et al. 2007 ). This study also specifically excluded genes of interest to us, namely imprinted genes or those showing cis-regulatory allelic imbalance.",

            "text": "Optimization of feature design for allele-specific discrimination Stringent hybridization of longer oligonucleotides generates specific and sensitive gene-expression analysis, overcoming the cross-hybridization potential of short oligonucleotides. Long oligonucleotides, however, tend to display a muted response to single-base mismatches, which is a requirement for allele discrimination as shown in Figure 1A and Wong et al. (2004) . To identify the optimal length and T m for ASE, we created a singlearray design that contained 20 probe sets (five T m \u202b\u05df\u202c four lengths) designed to assess ASE of 2194 SNPs in gene coding regions. Each probe set varied the minimum and maximum probe length, as well as the target T m of each oligonucleotide. Probe lengths ranged from 29 to 55 bases, and relative melting temperatures of 68\u00b0C to 120\u00b0C (Fig. 1A ). This algorithm is not only designed to maintain an approximately equal T m for all array probes, but also balances the T m of each probe in either side of the mismatch. This places the mismatch at the thermodynamic center of the oligonucleotide where it is most disruptive, and the approach is preferable to a simple sliding window. To improve hybridization kinetics we hybridized this optimization array design using a small volume hybridization chamber (45 \u00b5L) with active mixing. To determine the optimum probe length range and T m , we performed experiments on three cell lines from CEPH individuals with available genotype from the HapMap project using an array that was customized for exactly this family. In Figure 1A , we display box plots of the log 2 ratio of a true allele to the average of the two nonalleles. The left panel shows, for heterozygotes, the maximum of the two true alleles versus the average of the two nonalleles. The right panel is for homozygotes, showing the true allele versus the average of the two nonalleles. These data show that we can identify the expressed alleles and so may discriminate heterozygotes from homozygotes. Most importantly, the highest signal-to-noise ratio (i.e., the best data) comes from the longest features (39-49 nt), which are significantly longer than the 25-nt features used in previous studies (Lo et al. 2003; Pant et al. 2006) . Long feature lengths are easily achieved by the NimbleGen maskless array synthesis approach, which allows the construction of long-oligo arrays at essentially no added cost. Melting temperature did not appear to make a difference for the majority of different feature lengths. However, the highest melting temperature had detrimental effects on the longest features.",

Figure 1B (top) represents MA plots for all heterozygotes: the Y-axis is the log 2 ASE ratio (for an expressed allele vs. the background, control alleles), and the X-axis is the average log 2 intensity. The ASE ratio is therefore the log 2 ratio of the two bases that we know the individual carries, to the average of the two bases we know the individual does not carry (i.e., nonallele bases). The multiple probes for a particular SNP are averaged. These results demonstrate our ability to measure the expression of the specific alleles at a SNP, as the majority of the measurements are well above 0, particularly for genes of moderate to high expression (points with high intensity, on the right side of each figure), indicating that we are detecting the correct allele in the vast majority of cases, and the ASE estimates are largely concordant, except for cases in which one or the other strand showed no skewing in expression.",

Separate measures were obtained using the probes from the forward (\"plus\") DNA strand for a SNP and using the probes from the reverse (\"minus\") strand. This gives more precise information for a single SNP. When we compared the measurement of the two strands for each allele present in DNA, by measuring the log 2 ASE ratio in heterozygotes (that is, the ratio of the intensities for the two true alleles), the two measures of the log 2 ASE for individual SNPs showed great consistency (Fig.  1B, bottom) . The cloud of points centered at (0.0) corresponds to SNPs with no difference in the expression of the two alleles. Some SNPs in these CEPH cell lines show dramatic differences in the level of expression of the two alleles, and in these cases, the log 2 ASE ratio from the plus probes is generally similar to that from the minus probes, suggesting that we are indeed measuring true allele-specific silencing.",

For each of 65 SNPs (covering 10 genes), we obtained oligonucleotides corresponding to the two alleles and mixed them together in different proportions. For this experiment, the 45-nt oligonucleotides were synthetically biotinylated to allow their detection. To simulate the real situation in the complexity of the target in these experiments, we mixed the oligonucleotide mixture with cDNA obtained from total RNA from a single placental sample. We varied both the ratios of alleles of the synthetic targets, as well as the total concentration, testing 21 conditions (see Supplemental Tables 1, 2). We chose 1 pm to 200 pM concentration, because this range falls within the linear detection range for microarrays (Albert et al. 2003 ) and encompasses the range used in previous resequencing experiments (Wong et al. 2004) . Figure 2 shows box plots of the log 2 ratio of the output signals against the log 2 spiked-in ratio, as a function of the total amount of spiked-in DNA. A nearly linear relationship is seen, at least in the case that the total amount of DNA > 10 \u00b5M, indicating that we are able to recover the ASE ratios from the microarray intensity data. In the upper panels of Figure 2 , no background correction was applied, which results in an attenuation of the signal: instead of a ratio like a/b, we display (a +",

One of the genes showing allelic skewing with a log 2 ratio \u0546 1.5 was PEG10, a known imprinted gene (Supplemental Figs. 1, 2) . KCNQ1, another known imprinted gene, also demonstrated a high level of allelic skewing. Two known imprinted genes, GRB10 and HTR2A, were on the array, but not expressed in lymphoblasts, and thus we could not determine the ASE ratio. In addition, several genes on the array not expected to be imprinted did not demonstrate allelic skewing, e.g., TUBGCP6 (Supplemental Fig. 3 ). In the case of two genes, we were able to demonstrate that they are novel imprinted genes by analyzing allele-specific expression in fetal tissues and maternal samples, which we confirmed by pyrosequencing analysis (Alderborn et al. 2000) . The first of these was NLRP2, which encodes a member of the inflammasome (Petrilli et al. 2005) . For eight matched maternal (decidua) and offspring pairs in which the maternal sample was homozygous and the offspring sample was heterozygous at the assayed SNP, pyrosequencing analysis showed that ASE of cDNA of all eight cases was preferentially skewed toward the maternal allele (Fig. 4A) . Furthermore, NLRP2 also showed allelic skewing in primary tissues, fetal heart, and kidney (Supplemental Fig. 4) .

The next two rows demonstrate the pyrosequencing raw data files for the gDNA of the mother (homozygous) and the offspring (heterozygous), respectively.

In addition to these confirmed examples of ASE imbalance, a roughly equal number of sequences on the array did not show ASE imbalance by pyrosequencing analysis. At least five of these were due to HapMap genotyping errors rather than our method. Thus, the SNPs showed monoallelic expression on the array, but they were genomic homozygotes rather than the reported heterozygotes on the HapMap database: COLEC11, LOC144983, HK2, ADRA2B, and ZRANB1. In addition, 10 SNPs showed allelic skewing on the array, but not by pyrosequencing analysis. However, in all of these cases, the mismatched allele was not only present within the genotype of the target gene, but was also present in nonunique sequences throughout the genome.

Thus, the C/C allele is 2 \u202b\u05df\u202c C, followed by 2 \u202b\u05df\u202c T in the simplex, C/T is 1 \u202b\u05df\u202c C followed by 3 \u202b\u05df\u202c T, and T/T is 4 \u202b\u05df\u202c T.",

While we used the NimbleGen platform for these experiments, there is no reason in principle why other array platforms would not be equally useful if the average feature length of 40 nt can be maintained. In addition, we do not need to reduce the complexity of the target by PCR, thus avoiding amplification bias. While here we performed a proof of principle experiment on 12,000 SNPs on a 285-K feature array, a 2.2-M array will soon be available, and we can reduce the number of probes per SNP by at least half (two of the T m windows were experimentally found to be unnecessary), allowing an average of eight SNPs per gene scalable to the entire genome.",

The threshold for further screening is arbitrary and will likely change as the technology improves. A simple criterion would be to require an ASE imbalance in a larger number of samples or a larger number of SNPs per gene. In addition, currently, all probes are treated equally, but with a larger data set, we can exclude poorly performing probes, just as is done in conventional geneexpression arrays. Furthermore, in the next generation of arrays, we will exclude probes that cross-hybridize to other targets, e.g., using a fuzzy match algorithm (http://www.nimblegen.com/ products/chip/index.html).",

NLRP2 is regulated by interferon and lipopolysaccharides and suppresses activation of I-B kinases (Bruey et al. 2004) . To date, no gene involved primarily in immune response has been proven to be imprinted, despite the fact that one of the principal evolutionary drives to epigenetic modification is thought to be host defense (Bestor et al. 1994) . The second gene, OSBPL1A, is a member of a family of sterol sensors (Olkkonen et al. 2006) , and thus, could play a role in lipid metabolism. Another key role of epigenetic modification is thought to involve nutrient sensing (Jirtle and Skinner 2007) . OSBPL1A is located 20 kb from the imprinted gene IMPACT, but it has been reported not to be imprinted in mouse brain (Oka-mura et al. 2004) . Our data would indicate that the gene is imprinted in humans in at least some tissues. The fact that imprinting was variable is consistent with the idea that genomic regions can be susceptible, but not exclusively imprinted across all tissues and mammalian species.",

To overcome this limitation, we have developed an algorithm for resequencing and genotyping array probe selection that optimizes the oligonucleotide length, mismatch position, and melting temperature. The algorithm accepts input from the user to specify the minimum and maximum probe lengths and target T m for all probes on the array. The target T m of the probe is then divided in half, and the portion on each side of the mismatch is varied (within specified length parameters) to reach half of the specified target T m , calculated as follows: Probe T m = 5 \u202b\u05df\u202c (G n + C n ) + 1 \u202b\u05df\u202c (A n + T n ), where G n is the number of Gs, C n is the number of Cs, and so on for the other bases in the probe. This is an empirical modification of the Wallace rule (Wallace et al. 1979) , made to better reflect surface probe behavior. This results in array probes with varying length, similar melting temperatures, and with mismatches near the thermodynamic center of each oligonucleotide, where they are most destabilizing, rather than the physical center. Initially we chose 1097 SNPs, which were used for an array designed to optimize the probe length and melting temperature. This array tested probe lengths varying from 29 to 39 nt up to 45-55 nt, with melting temperatures calculated using the formula above between 68\u00b0C and 120\u00b0C. This array was used to determine that the probe set that gave the best balance between sensitivity and allele discrimination contained probes that varied in length from 39 to 49 nt, with a calculated target T m of 100\u00b0C and an average length of 40 nt. We then designed a 380,000 feature array from NimbleGen with features representing 12,000 SNPs in \u223c5800 genes for all possible nucleotides (i.e., A, T, C, G) in both orientations with four sliding windows, using the experimentally determined optimal probe length and T m . Four sliding windows were achieved by varying the location of the SNP within the feature four individual times. Cell culture Six lymphoblast cell lines comprising two trios from CEPH family 1341 were ordered from Coriell. Trio 1 is composed of GM06991, GM06993, GM06985; Trio 2 is composed of GM07034, GM07055, and GM07048. The cell lines were cultured at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640, 2 mM L-glutamine, 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.",
