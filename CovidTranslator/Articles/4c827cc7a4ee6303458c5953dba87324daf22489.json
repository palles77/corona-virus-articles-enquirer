The latest crude and child mortality rates are below emergency levels, while global acute malnutrition remains high. 4 The site is served by five hospitals run by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and foreign governments with a total of 340 hospital beds (5.7 beds per 10,000 population) and up to 630 hospital beds when needed (10.6 per 10,000 population). 5 There are 24 primary health care centers (1 PHC/25,000 persons) with numerous health posts, though the total number of functioning PHCs varies. 6, 7 Outside of the refugee site, there are 910 beds available in Cox's Bazar district, including government, private, and NGO facilities for both the host community and refugees. 8, 9 The district hospital, with a 250-bed capacity, typically treats between 400-600 inpatients daily; 50-60 of whom are estimated to be refugees. 9,10 It suffers from overcrowding with a bed occupancy rate over 200%, poor infection control, and inadequate hygiene protocol and waste management. 9, 10 While it has six intensive care unit (ICU) beds available, the ICU is reportedly not functional. 11 There are an estimated 0.31 physicians and 0.12 nurses per 1,000 population in Bangladesh, far below the 4.5 skilled health workers per 1,000 population recommended by WHO. 12, 13 In this study, we aim to understand how SARS-CoV-2 might impact refugee camp populations, using the Rohingya refugees living in the Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site as a case study. The primary aims of this analysis are to: 1) develop a baseline expectation of the possible infection burden, speed, and hospitalization capacity needed to respond to a COVID-19 epidemic; 2) use these findings to provide some recommendations to support ongoing preparedness planning by the Bangladesh government, United Nations agencies and other actors for a COVID-19 outbreak; and 3) apply lessons from this case study to refugees and other forcibly displaced persons globally.",

We simulated epidemics under three potential scenarios with different values of the basic reproductive number, R 0 : 1) a low transmission scenario based on transmission levels in many of the Chinese provinces with elevated isolation and control practices and an R 0 similar to influenza (R 0 =1.5-2.0) 14 ; 2) a moderate transmission scenario that mirrors estimates in early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, China (R 0 =2.0-3.0) 15 ; and, 3) a high transmission scenario where we assume that R 0 is increased by a factor of 1.65 (R 0 =3.3-5.0) compared to estimates from open community settings, as was observed during the 2017 diphtheria outbreak. 16 The R 0 in each of these scenarios falls within the 95% confidence interval of the current range of estimates for COVID-19. 17 We assumed an Erlang distributed serial interval (time between the onset of symptoms in infector-infectee pairs) with a mean of 6 days (standard deviation = 4.2). 18 The proportion of infections that result in severe disease was estimated using data from a closed population of contacts in Shenzhen, China, for which complete data on contact, age, test results, symptoms, and initial severity were available. 18 Using a Bayesian binomial model, we estimated the proportion of infections that were severe by 10-year age groups and then applied those estimates to the Kutupalong-Balukhali population to get an overall proportion of infections that will develop into severe disease in the specific population. These estimates do not account for differences in comorbidities, differing attack rates by age due to population mixing characteristics, or various other factors.",

Thus, we assumed the proportion hospitalized was equivalent to the age-adjusted severe disease proportion calculated for the population and applied this to incident infections from the model simulations. 18 We assumed 26.4% of severe cases would require intensive care and estimated deaths assuming a 10% case fatality risk rate among hospitalizations/severe disease. We conservatively did not account for potential increases in mortality when healthcare resources are exhausted. We assumed hospitalization occurs a median of 3.42 days after symptom onset (lognormally distributed, standard deviation=0.79), 18 hospitalized cases are discharged after a mean of 11.5 days (95% CI, 8.0-17.3), and deaths occur after a mean of 11.2 days (95% CI, 8.7-14.9). 14 Additionally, early reports from the outbreak in China indicate that mechanical ventilation was required by approximately 25% of patients with severe disease, while the remaining 75% required only oxygen supplementation. 19",

Even when transmission rates were assumed to be similar to that of influenza (low scenario), the necessary hospitalization capacities far exceeded the available capacities for the refugees in the Expansion Site in most simulations. Recent experience with other infectious disease outbreaks shows that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will likely be more intense in contexts such as Kutupalong-Balukhali Expansion Site than in out-of-camp settings because of high population density, inadequate water and soap to maintain hygiene, limited ability to isolate infected individuals, and large household sizes. 16 The younger demographic profile of the Rohingya camp population could reduce the overall rate of severe cases as compared with China or other upper-middle and high-income countries that have older populations. After adjusting for age, we estimate the overall severe disease rate among infections in this population (3.6%) to be approximately half that estimated for China (6.6% [95% CI, 3.7-10.4]).

A surge of international health care workers could be considered, but this will be difficult given the high demands worldwide during the pandemic and existing travel restrictions. Furthermore, issues of introduction of the virus from expatriates into Bangladesh would need to be carefully addressed. A more likely strategy will be task shifting among existing health care workers, with physicians treating the most severe cases, nurses the less severe cases, and community health workers addressing mild infections. Such task shifting would require intensive training that needs to begin immediately.

While culturally difficult and requiring socialization, isolating people over 60 years of age and those designated medically vulnerable together in certain designated areas of the camp may need to be considered. One possibility could be sub-sector-level isolation, where 50-100 high risk people could be grouped together in existing areas of the camp where they are already located. 20 Consistent monitoring of fever and other symptoms combined with appropriate testing, if sufficient tests become available, will be an integral part of this strategy. Such an isolation approach would require sufficient resources to provide comprehensive care (e.g., food and supportive services) for isolated community members. Since physical distancing will be extremely difficult, the use of facemasks among those most at risk, and possibly the whole population could be considered if there are eventually sufficient global supplies. Rapid and creative solutions for improving hand hygiene, such as the installation of a multitude of handwashing stations and distribution of hand sanitizer combined with communication campaigns, will be needed. Access to accurate and consistent health information will be critical, as already rumors and misinformation have spread among Rohingya refugees about COVID-19, partly due to camp-wide restrictions on the internet and telecommunications. 21 In the future, the use of people who have recovered from COVID-19 infections will need to be considered after more data become available as to their ability to become re-infected and transmit to others, as was done with Ebola survivors. 22 The three scenarios show varying degrees of increased mortality. Mortality due to COVID-19 is dependent upon various factors, particularly access to hospitals with ICUs and ventilators. Currently, there is only one facility with few mechanical ventilators in the camps and one facility with less than 10 ICU beds and no ventilators. Therefore, it is likely that mortality rates due to COVID-19 will be significantly higher here than in settings where nationals or refugees have such access. Reportedly, the ICUs and ventilators are not functioning in the district hospital in Cox's Bazar, and thus access to health care facilities to treat severe cases of COVID-19 may be equally challenging for nationals.

Additionally, the current evidence on the natural history and key epidemiological properties of COVID-19 reflect the interactions of the SARS-Cov-2 virus with nondisplaced populations. Population structure and population health can lead to widely different burden of disease with no modifications to the virus.

Therefore, while difficult for governments to state openly at this point, it is likely that most countries will restrict access to their hospitals to nationals only, particularly when there are large numbers of refugees in the same geographical area. We are already seeing governments closing their border to non-nationals, and in some cases, not allowing people to seek asylum. 29 Such a predicament leaves refugees and other nonnationals, such as undocumented migrants, in an extremely precarious position. During a pandemic, there will be limited support by countries to establish field hospitals with ICU capabilities for refugees in camp-like settings, as they will be occupied with addressing their own national response. Unfortunately, there is no simple recommendation as to how to address this life and death issue. However, we believe it is important to acknowledge the likelihood that host countries' hospitals will be closed to refugees in most camp-like settings, and consequently, COVID-19 preparedness and response plans should proceed on realistic scenarios.",

The widespread rise of populism combined with anti-migrant and anti-refugee sentiments that we are observing globally provides a hostile environment that could be exacerbated by a pandemic. We are concerned that the COVID-19 pandemic, while completely unrelated to being a refugee, could be used as an excuse to take retribution against refugees, as well as other vulnerable groups such as IDPs and undocumented migrants. Such retribution could take many forms, including restricting or stopping asylum seekers, which is currently occurring, the closure of camps, and forced repatriation (refoulement, which is against refugee law), all used in the name of public health.
