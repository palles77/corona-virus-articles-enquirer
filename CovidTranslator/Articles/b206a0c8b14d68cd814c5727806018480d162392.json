            "text": "The California 99 (Cal99) variant of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was first recovered in 1999 from vaccinated broiler chicken flocks in Central California. The S1 hypervariable region of Cal99 genome was most closely related to Arkansas (Ark) serotype viruses. In this study, the complete genome of Cal99 was sequenced, and the structural protein genes were compared with those of commonly used IBV vaccines as well as those of isolates from naturally occurring outbreaks in different parts of the world, to elucidate potential sources of genetic material. Based on sequence comparison, the prototype Cal99 virus is similar to the apathogenic ArkDPI virus, except in the S1 gene and stretches of sequence in the S2 and M structural protein genes, which are more related to Connecticut (Conn) and Massachusetts (Mass) strain viruses, respectively. We speculate that these two fragments came from a Conn and a Mass virus, respectively, and were incorporated into a virus largely derived from ArkDPI. Since Ark, Conn and Mass strains have been simultaneously used as live vaccines in California, both point mutations and recombination among vaccine strains may have contributed to the emergence of the Cal99 variant virus. Analysis of the structural protein genes of six Cal99 isolates demonstrated that viruses of this serotype may differ substantially in the non-S1 structural genes. Finally, we performed a challenge study with Cal99 and demon-strated that the virus causes late-onset respiratory disease, with a severity comparable to that of the M41 IBV challenge strain.",

            "text": "Typing of IBV strains is based on the features of the spike (S) protein [2, 3] . The S1 subunit of the IBV spike glycoprotein carries virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific antigenic determinants [4] , which can evolve rapidly especially within the three hypervariable regions (HVRs) [5, 6] . Variant viruses that escape host immune surveillance by mutations in the S1 gene have resulted in new IBV serotypes, an expansion from the original Mass serotype in the 1940s to the 20 plus recognized serotypes today [1, 7] . The S2 subunit may also induce neutralizing antibodies, and IBV serotypes can be grouped based on S2 gene sequence [8, 9] . Although the spike is the most variable gene, the N gene and N-terminus of the IBV M protein also vary between strains [10, 11] . Mutations and recombination in the IBV genome have resulted in viruses that have increased virulence [12] , varied tissue tropism [13, 14] , and an increased ability to persist in the chicken host [13, 15] . Both point mutations and recombination events have been observed in multiple structural genes of IBV recovered from naturally occurring infections [3, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . All of the recombination events attributed to IBV to date, have been described for individual structural genes (mostly in the S gene), and none of the reports have addressed the impact of recombination or mutation on viral pathogenesis or characterization of the virus with diagnostic tests. Therefore, it has been impossible to fully understand the impact of viral evolution on disease diagnosis and viral pathogenicity.",

Previously, we demonstrated that the Cal99 S1 hypervariable region (HVR) is similar to Ark IBV strains [25] . We also analyzed the sequence of four functional regions of the replicase gene and found that the Cal99 prototype virus was consistently closely related (>99% homology) to the ArkDPI, H52, and GA98 IBV strains [26] . Herein, we describe the complete genome sequence of Cal99, its comparison to other complete IBV genome sequences, and analysis of the virus' structural genes by one by one comparison with heterologous IBV strains from around the world. We present evidence that the Cal99 virus may have originated from an Ark IBV strain, which acquired new antigenic characteristics through extensive mutations in the S1 gene, and that Cal99 may have undergone two RNA recombination events in the S2 and M protein genes. Further analysis of the structural genes of additional Cal99 isolates from commercial chickens demonstrated that viruses of the same antigenic type may differ substantially in the non-S1 structural genes. Finally, we performed a challenge study with the Cal99 prototype virus and demonstrated that the virus causes late-onset respiratory disease, with severity comparable to that of the M41 IBV challenge strain.",

These virus strains were selected because they are very common vaccine or virulent strains isolated from commercial chickens in different countries and parts of the world. The complete Cal99 sequence was compared to published full length IBV sequences (Table 1) using the same procedures for comparison. Five Cal99 isolates (CU82989, CU82994, K01-1699, F04-2438 and S04-8842) were compared to selected reference viruses (ArkDPI, Ark99, BJ, DE072, GA98, Conn, M41 and Beaudette) and the 50 most closely related strains identified using BlastN in four genes. All of the Cal99 isolates were recovered from commercial chickens in the Western USA during outbreaks of IB.",

First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) following the manufacturer's instructions. The entire genome of Cal99 was PCR amplified using universal primers synthesized from conserved regions ( Table 2 ). Primers were initially synthesized from conserved areas deduced from the alignment of the complete sequence of the Beaudette strain of IBV and other coronavirus sequences, and tested on six reference strains of IBV (M41, Conn, Ark99, GA98, DE072, and Cal99). Between 1 kb and 2 kb of the 3\u00a2 and 5\u00a2 ends of each of the overlapping fragments generated were sequenced. These sequences of overlapping regions were aligned and universal primers were created in conserved areas. These primers were used to generate large cDNA fragments (3-6 kb; fragments A-F) that were cloned to create a nearly full-length cDNA library of Cal99 virus (Fig. 1 ). The PCR profiles involved an initial denaturation for 1 min [26] . The RT-PCR amplified fragments of the Cal99 virus were cloned (except fragment B) into the pCR 2.1-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA). The pCR 2.1-TOPO clones were screened by miniprep and vectors containing fragments of the proper size were partially sequenced to assure that the proper fragment was cloned. These clones were subsequently used for sequencing Cal99 genome at a commercial sequencing facility (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). Fragment B was sequenced directly from RT-PCR product. A combination of flanking and internal primers was used to sequence both cDNA strands. The structural protein genes of other IBV strains were RT-PCR amplified and sequenced by direct cycle sequencing [10, 40, 41] .",

After 28 days, all birds were wing banded for identification, bled, and were divided into six experimental groups. There were 14 birds in each of the IBV-inoculated groups (A to D), eight birds in the E. coli control group (E), and seven birds in the uninoculated negative control group (F; Table 4 ). All birds in groups A-D were inoculated intranasally with approximately 10 4 ELD 50 of IBV with or without approximately 10 8 colony forming units of avian-origin Escherichia coli (E. coli) in 0.1 ml of tryptose phosphate broth (TPB). The birds were observed daily for clinical signs throughout the experiment. At 34 days of age (6 dpi), one-third of the chickens in each group were humanely euthanized with an overdose of carbon dioxide gas. At necropsy, all lesions that were grossly visible, were noted, and tissues (trachea, lung, cecal tonsil, and kidney) and tracheal swabs were collected for virus and bacterial isolation. Post-mortem blood was collected from all birds for IBV serology. Again at both 38 days (10 dpi) and 42 days of age (14 dpi), one-third of the chickens were humanely euthanized and the sampling procedure repeated. The numbers of birds euthanized in each group at each time point are shown in Table 4 .

Overall, the 5\u00a2terminal sequence of the 3\u00a2UTR was 55.7-73.7% identical among the isolates, and was the most variable region, while the most conserved region, the 5b gene, was 89.6-98.8% identical among all strains ( Table 3) . The S glycoprotein gene of the Cal99 strain was 21 and 30 bases longer than those of the Beaudette [39] and Ark99 [18] strains, respectively. In the S1 gene, the Cal99 virus and other strains were 61.3-87.0% identical to Ark serotype strains (Ark99, ArkDPI), and the CU-T2 strain was the most similar at the nt level (86.1-87.0% identical). The nt differences between these strains are distributed throughout the S1 gene of the Cal99 virus, although the highest variation is in the HVR of the S1 gene [5, 6] . A 15-base insertion (nt 420-434) unique to Ark-type viruses, is present in the Cal99 S1 gene, although the 15 bases contain 7 and 8 nt different from the Ark99 and ArkDPI strains, respectively. In addition, the Cal99 S1 gene has the same three base insert identical of the CU-T2 virus. This codon encodes an asparagine at position 345. A substitution of T by a G in the TAA stop codon, results in a Cal99 S2 gene 27 bases longer than that of Ark99. This same mutation is also found in CU-T2. When the deduced aa sequences of Cal99 and ArkDPI S1 genes were compared, the first 161 residues of the Cal99 S1 had 41 differences (25%), and the last 221 residues had 27 differences (12%), whereas the middle 156 residues were nearly identical with only two aa differences (1.3%). The 5\u00a2 1193 nt region of the Cal99 S2 gene was 92.9% identical to ArkDPI (91.6% identical to Conn, and 91.3% to CU-T2), whereas the 3\u00a2-terminus 700 nts were 99.3% identical to the Conn strain (97.0% identical to ArkDPI, and 88.9% to CU-T2; Table 3 ). A putative crossover site was identified as a stretch of A-T rich upstream sequence (TAATGGTATAGTG-TTTATACACTTT) between nts 1193 through 1218, which is absolutely conserved in all of the IBV strains studied. Gene 3 of the Cal99 virus is nearly identical (>99%) to that of the Conn strain, except in the 114 nt that overlap with gene 4. The 3a gene of the Cal99 virus is 100% identical to those of Conn and Ark99 strains, with all other strains less similar ( < 96% identity). The 3b and 3c nt sequences of Cal99 were identical to those of the Conn and ArkDPI strains, except the 3\u00a2 end that overlaps with gene 4, whereas these same genes in other IBV strains had less identity (Table 3) . Interestingly, the 5\u00a2 end of the Cal99 gene 4 (M protein gene) has a stretch of 92 nts with 99.5% identity to the Mass strains, M41 and H52, and the Japanese strain, KB8523 (Fig. 4) . This stretch of sequence includes the two glycosylation sites of the M protein (Fig. 4b) . In this region, the Cal99 strain has one nt non-synonymous difference from the M41 strain, and two differences, including one non-synonymous, from the H52 and KB8523 strains. Two putative crossover sites were identified around bases 42 and 133 of gene 4 (Fig. 4a) . The sequences downstream from these sites in the Cal99 virus, from the 5\u00a2 terminus of the M protein gene through 3\u00a2 end of gene 5 and including the highly variable IG sequence between the M and 5a genes, was 98-100% identical to the Conn and ArkDPI strains. Pairwise comparisons of the Cal99 M protein gene, excluding the 5\u00a2 terminal 139 nt, with other IBV strains showed that the nt identity ranges from 88.5% to 99.0% (88.2-98.6% aa), with Conn and ArkDPI strains being the closest matches, and with CU-T2 strain the least similar ( Table 3 ). The IG sequence between the M and 5a genes of the Cal99 virus has a 49 base sequence that is also present in the Conn, Ark-DPI, M41, Gray, and CU-T2 strains but is absent from the H52, DE072, and GA98 strains. This IG sequence (342 nt) between the M and 5a genes of the Cal99 virus is 99.5% identical to those of the Conn and ArkDPI strains. The 5a and 5b genes of the Cal99 strain are 100% and 98.4% identical, respectively, to those of the ArkDPI and Conn strains, which are, in turn, identical to each other (Table 3 ). Both the nt and deduced aa sequences of the Cal99 N protein gene are 99.7% and 99.5% identical, respectively, to the ArkDPI strain. All ",

In this trial, the clinical signs in birds exposed to either the Cal99 or the M41 virus were very mild. The only exception were the M41-inoculated chickens co-infected with E. coli where the birds had signs of respiratory distress and one bird died on day 3 post-inoculation (pi; Table 4 ). At necropsy, more than 60% of the birds exposed to M41 (regardless of E. coli co-infection) had nasal discharge and/or airsacculitis on days 6, 10, and 14 pi. Only one bird out of five inoculated with the Cal99 virus had grossly detectable airsacculitis on day 14 pi. Virus isolation from tissues collected at necropsy indicated that the Cal99 virus persisted longer in inoculated birds than did the M41 virus ( Table 4 ). The Cal99 virus isolation was positive until day 14 pi, whereas the M41 virus disappeared after day 10 pi. The virus isolation data was well-correlated with histopathologic findings. On day 6 pi, birds inoculated with the Cal99 virus had lesions in the trachea characterized as a moderate diffuse lymphocytic tracheitis with prominent deciliation, multifocal squamous metaplasia, and foci where the tracheal epithelium had sloughed (Fig. 7) . The lesions were most severe on day 6 pi in the M41 inoculated birds with extensive mononuclear cellular infiltration in the lamina propria of the tracheas. On day 10 pi, the tracheal epithelia were nearly normal in appearance, with multifocal, moderate accumulations of lymphocytes admixed with tissue macrophages and heterophils in the lamina propria of both the Cal99 and M41 inoculated groups On day 10 pi, the tracheal epithelia of both the Cal99 and M41 inoculated groups were nearly normal in appearance with moderate accumulations of lymphocytes admixed with tissue macrophages and heterophils in the lamina propria. On day 14 pi, the Cal99-infected group had lesions characterized by focal lymphatic nodules in the lamina propria with desquamation of epithelium overlying the nodules; however, in the M41-inoculated groups, no lesions were observed although the thickness of the tracheal mucosa was slightly more than in the uninoculated negative control group. Virus re-isolation records (bottom signs): positive (+) indicates virus was isolated from every birds in a group, negative (-) indicates virus isolation was not successful from any bird in a group, and both positive and negative (\u00b1) indicates some birds were positive for virus isolation but some were not in a group (groups A, B, C, and D). On day 14 pi, the Cal99infected groups (groups A and B) had tracheal lesions characterized by focal lymphatic nodules in the lamina propria with desquamation of epithelium overlying the nodules. In the M41-inoculated groups (groups C and D), no lesions were observed although the tracheal mucosa was slightly thickened compared to the uninoculated negative control group (group F). Both the Cal99 and M41 IBV-inoculated birds (groups A and D) had severe diffuse lymphocytic bronchiolitis with multifocal lymphoid nodules extending into the lung parenchyma. In this experiment, the mixed infections of IBV and E. coli (groups B and D) resulted in no significant differences in tracheal and lung lesions compared to infection with IBV alone (groups A and C), despite the fact that E. coli was isolated from the respiratory tract (Table 4 ). There were no significant lesions noted in renal tissues of any groups.",

            "text": "The Cal99 variant of IBV caused significant airsacculitis in commercial broiler chickens in California [23, 24] , although challenge studies have not shown this virus to be highly pathogenic under experimental conditions [23, 44] . The HVR of the Cal99 S1 gene is closely related to Ark viruses [25] , which are a group of IBV vaccine strains and pathogenic viruses originally isolated in the Northeastern USA [27, 28] . We previously demonstrated that the four functional regions of replicase gene of the Cal99 strain are closely related to those of the ArkDPI and H52 vaccine strains [26] . In this study, we demonstrate that the entire Cal99 virus is very similar to the ArkDPI virus originally recovered from chicken flocks in the Northeastern USA, except in the S1 gene, where there are multiple individual nucleotide differences and in some stretches of sequence in other structural genes. For example, there is a stretch of sequence at the 3\u00a2 end of Cal99 S2 gene that is similar to the corresponding region of the Conn strain virus, and another fragment at the 5\u00a2 end of M gene that is most similar to Mass strain viruses both isolated from commercial chicken flocks in the USA. We speculate that these two fragments came from a Conn and a Mass virus, respectively, and were incorporated into a virus largely derived from ArkDPI. Similar IBV recombination events have been observed in CU-T2 [18] and DE072 [31] both isolated from commercial chicken flocks in the northeastern USA. Based on these results, we suggest that the Cal99 virus originated from the ArkDPI strain, but diverged and evolved independently. Since Ark, Conn and Mass strains have been simultaneously used as live vaccines in California (P. Woolcock, personal communication), it may be that both point mutations and recombination among vaccine strains contributed to the emergence of the Cal99 variant virus. It is also possible that the Cal99 virus arose from non-vaccine viruses circulating in California, since it is not known how many non-vaccine origin IBVs of these same serotypes are also present in California commercial chickens. It is also possible that the Cal99 virus pre-existed the use of vaccines in California chicken flocks and that the genetic similarity is due to the fact that this is a particularly good configuration for IBV. However, based on the widespread use of live vaccines of the same serotypes as found in this variant virus, we conclude that the most likely scenario is that the Cal99 virus arose from the genetic material of vaccine viruses by recombination and mutation.",

            "text": "Recombination in coronaviruses is thought to occur by template switching mechanism [45, 46] . It has been observed in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that RNA recombination occurs preferentially at specific sites in vitro [47] although, this may be that specific mutations are selected in the immune host [48] . Recombination hot spots have been theorized in the IBV isolates, CU-T2 and DE072 [18, 20] . In addition, RNA recombination in IBV may occur randomly in non-localized sites both in vitro [48, 49] and in vivo [17] . In our study of the Cal99 virus, an A-T rich potential crossover site between nts 1193 and 1218 of the S2 gene was found. A second potential recombination event was identified at the 5\u00a2 end of the Cal99 M gene where two possible crossover sites around bases 42 and 133 were identified. Similar recombination events at the 5\u00a2 end of M gene have been observed in viruses isolated from naturally occurring infections [11, 17] . Wang et al. [22] described an A-T rich CTTTTG sequence adjacent to every putative recombination junction. Although, another study found that recombination did not occur near every CTTTTG sequence, suggesting that recombination in IBV occurs randomly rather than preferentially at specific sites [17] . In the current study, the first possible crossover site, AACGAGTT, is 25 bases downstream of the TRS or IG sequence of the M gene and is conserved in all of the IBV strains studied. The second potential crossover site, CTTTT(C/T), is reminiscent of the AT-rich CTTTTG sequence (Fig. 4a) . The 92 base-long sequence of the Cal99 virus that is flanked by these two potential crossover sites, is identical to the Mass serotype strains, M41 and H52, but has little similarity to Ark or Conn strains. Interestingly, this 92 base stretch of sequence includes the two M protein glycosylation sites demonstrating that an exchange of genetic material in this region could impact the glycosylation pattern of IBVs [50] and, therefore, change the results of the immunoblot diagnostic test [51] . Multiple crossover sites in a small area are not uncommon in coronaviruses, as demonstrated in the MHV peplomer gene where there are seven crossover sites within a 135 nt region [47] .",

The addition of S1 gene sequencing may add useful information to the diagnosis of IBV but, as in the case of Cal99, the sequence shows a virus most related to Ark serotype viruses but serotype-specific Mab reactivity shows that the Cal99 serotype is not the same as Ark. In addition, sequencing the S1 gene provides little information about the origin or continuing evolution of IBVs since recombination and mutation may produce viruses of novel genotypes, as is the case with Cal99. The diagnosis of IBVs remains difficult and it is important that none of the existing diagnostic tests are overinterpreted as each has its own weaknesses and taken together may provide a misleading and confusing picture, as was the case in the initial diagnostic characterization of the Cal99 serotype viruses.",

            "text": "The challenge of SPF chickens with the Cal99 virus in this study, showed that the virus causes mild to moderate tracheitis and bronchiolitis and persists longer in the respiratory tract than the pathogenic strain, M41. This is consistent with the late-onset of respiratory disease observed in the original outbreaks in commercial broiler flocks [23, 24] . When compared to the M41 inoculated groups, the recovery periods in Cal99 challenged groups were delayed by approximately 3-4 days. However, the clinical signs and gross lesions observed in Cal99 and M41 exposed birds did not vary significantly indicating that the Cal99 prototype virus is pathogenic. While not surprising data, it is not always the case that IBV strains associated with disease in commercial poultry flocks are pathogenic in SPF chickens. It is often the case that the pathogenicity of IBVs is contextual and they only produce disease in the presence of the endemic bacterial and viral diseases of commercial poultry flocks such as E. coli and Mycoplasma spp.",

It is clear that IBV evolution is a continuous process and thus the development of novel control measures that do not utilize live viruses may be required to truly control this pathogen.",

Additional sequences from GenBank have been included in Fig. 4 and are identified in the figure by accession number. Results Amplification, cloning and sequencing of the Cal99 virus The Cal99 virus was amplified into six (A-F) large overlapping fragments (3-6 kb; Fig. 1b). A nearly fulllength cDNA library of the Cal99 virus was constructed (Fig. 1c), and used for genome sequencing. The complete genome of Cal99 consists of 27,693 nucleotides (nt) which encode six different genes or mRNAs, each containing of single or multiple open reading frames (ORFs; Fig. 2a). Gene 1 (replicase gene) consists of 20,421 nt, which contain a 5\u00a2 UTR of 526 nt and two open reading frames (ORFs), ORF 1a and 1b. These two ORFs consist of 11,862 and 8,064 nt (potentially coding 3,953 and 2,687 aa), respectively. Gene 2 (spike protein gene) of the Cal99 virus is 3570 bases long, with a single ORF of 3510 nt (encoding 1169 aa). The S1 and S2 genes are 1617 and 1893 nt long respectfully, and are predicted to encode 539 and 630 aa each. There are 110 nt of overlap between the 3\u00a2 end of ORF1b and the 5\u00a2 end of the S protein gene. Gene 3 of Cal99 consists of 709 nt, which contains three ORFs: 3a, 3b, and 3c. The ORFs consist of 174, 195, and 330 nt (potentially encoding 57, 64 and 109 aa), respectively. A total of 32 nt of the coding sequence of the S protein gene overlap gene 3. Gene 4 (the M protein gene) consists of 763 nt with a single ORF of 678 nt (encoding 225 aa). There are 114 nt of overlap between the 3\u00a2 end of the 3c and the 5\u00a2 end of the M protein gene. There is a non-coding region consisting of 342 nt between the 3\u00a2 end of the M protein gene and gene 5. Gene 5 contains two ORFs: 5b with 198 and 249 nt (potentially encoding 65 and 82 aa), respectively. Of the 5b ORF 159 nt overlap the 5\u00a2 end of the N protein gene. The N protein gene of Cal99 is 1331 bases long, with a single ORF of 1230 nt (capacity to code for 409 aa). The 3\u00a2 UTR of Cal99 is 512 bases long.
