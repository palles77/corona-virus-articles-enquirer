The inauguration of President Obama on January 20, 2009, attracted a crowd of 1.8 million to the National Mall in Washington, D.C.; a state of emergency was declared to allow the release of federal money and resources. Protests during the Arab Spring in 2011 drew millions of largely peaceful protesters to central locations of Tunis, Tunisia, and Cairo, Egypt. More than 5 million were present when the departure of Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak was announced in February, 2011. 1 Millions of people celebrated the 2014 World Cup in Brazil without significant problems; it seems that lessons have been learned from previous soccer disasters (Table 202-1) .",

Preplanning and prediction of resource requirements, based on careful needs assessment of anticipated medical care usage and public health risks, may lead to a standardized optimal provision of medical care (Box 202-1). 8 Provision of medical care is the responsibility of the event planners. Public health officials need to be involved early in the planning process, especially for large events, such as the Olympics, world fairs, and pilgrimages. The local health department should be involved in overseeing the preparation, storage, and serving of food and sanitation requirements. Once identified, those providing medical care at mass gatherings need to liaise with local emergency medical services (EMS), fire, and law enforcement officials. Ground and building plans, close estimates of possible attendance, and identification of any specific hazards should be shared among these providers. Multiple variables interact to make planning for a mass gathering event challenging. An understanding of these may allow for a more efficient and effective planning process. Some of these variables will be discussed below.",

However, previous history is notoriously unreliable, as demonstrated by the papal mass in Denver (1993) where 250,000 people were predicted but 500,000 turned up. An adequate ticketing system is essential, as well as public address measures to inform crowds of no further access to an event once capacity is reached. 9 Mass gathering venues should have multiple access points for entering and exiting the site. During the 1990 Hajj, 1426 people lost their lives due to a stampede as all the pilgrims were trying to leave the city of Mecca at the same time through a tunnel. 10 Planners should promote a unidirectional flow of the crowd, which would significantly reduce the risk of crowd convergence. Training of security staff in crowd control should be implemented before an event to improve crowd safety and avoid panic should overcrowding occur. During a football match in Ellis Park, South Africa, tear gas was thrown into a crowd by event security in an effort to disperse intense overcrowding. This, unfortunately, served to incite panic and caused a stampede (Table 202-1). 9 Keeping the crowd comfortable and relaxed is also essential, therefore awnings, cooling fans (in hot weather), and entertainment are sometimes helpful and should be part of the preplanning.",

[11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Primary medical care, such as first aid, emergency care, and preparation for a possible disaster, should be addressed. Staffing levels and type of staffing also need to be anticipated. Recommended ratios include one to two physicians per 50,000 attendees, two paramedics or one paramedic and one emergency medical technician per 10,000 attendees, and one basic first aid provider per 1000 participants at the event. 16 On-site physicians have been shown to reduce ambulance transfers to local hospitals by as much as 89%, 17 significantly lessening the impact of an event on local EMS services and hospitals. The majority of nondisaster injuries and medical complaints at a mass gathering can be effectively treated at the scene, which reduces the number of hospital referrals and patient presentation rates to the hospital. Physician presence should be strongly encouraged at events where significant trauma may occur or where there is a long distance to definitive care. Cardiac arrest cases are rare in mass gatherings, with reports of 0.5 to 1 per 500,000, though on-site resuscitation and early defibrillation are important and can improve patient survival rates. 18 A prediction tool for expected medical needs considering five different variables (attendance, heat index, crowd age, crowd mood, and availability of alcohol) was developed and tested in 55 mass gathering events (Tables 202-3 and 202-4). 19 After the anticipated usage rates and staffing levels have been addressed, the positioning, number, and type of aid stations should be considered. Fixed events at stadiums may have areas specially designed and designated for medical care. For other events, aid station locations should be no more than a 5-minute walk for attendees. Stations should be clearly visible, and the locations should be known to participants and other event personnel. These areas need to be adequately and appropriately staffed before the anticipated start of the event, and remain so until the event is completed. Consideration needs to be given to providing medical care in the crowd for occurrences such as cardiac arrest or lower extremity fractures, including how to transport these patients to aid stations. Thought needs to be given regarding provision of ambulances for hospital transport and access and egress for these vehicles. The organizers of medical care need to know the capabilities of local hospitals and should liaise with hospital personnel before the event. All patient encounters should be documented. Use of noncarbon record (NCR) paper will facilitate a copy accompanying a patient who needs transport to a medical facility.",

Patient encounters at events with more than 1 million participants average 10 per 10,000 participants. Events with fewer participants average 41 per 10,000 spectators. One interpretation of this is that it is easier to seek medical care at a less crowded venue. The medical usage rate can vary even within an event itself. At the Los Angeles Olympics, soccer events had usage rates of 68 per 1000, and rowing and canoeing, 6.8 per 1000 spectators. Anticipated crowd demographics may be useful in the preplanning stage. Older groups may be expected at papal visits, classical music concerts, and large sporting events. 27 Younger groups frequently attend rock concerts and auto-racing events. 28 The needs of children also must be considered. Most children present with minor injuries, but medical teams need to be prepared to deal with serious medical emergencies and trauma. Overall medical usage at a children's fair was 19.2 per 10,000 participants, and half of those who presented were younger than 14 years old. Protocols need to be in place for the provision of care to minors who present without an accompanying adult. 14 ",

Severe trauma may occur in up to 1.4% of attendees at rock concerts. Medical issues include headache, syncope, asthma, and hypoglycemia. Cardiac arrest is uncommon, with a rate of 0.01 to 0.04 per 10,000 attendees. Asthma may be very common at rodeos. 31 The ultimate sporting event is probably the Olympics. Planning for the medical care of both spectators and participants begins as soon as the host city has been announced. Around 10 million spectators attended the 2012 London Olympics. Apart from routine medical care, there exists a potential for transmission of infectious diseases, risk of injury from crowd crushing, and now the very real risk of terrorist activity or political protests. Extensive planning at local, state, and federal levels is vital to ensure the health and safety of all concerned. [32] [33] [34] At the 1996 Atlanta games, specialized incident assessment teams were set up to analyze terrorist risks and to address issues such as stockpiling of antibiotics and antidotes. Medical providers of all levels received training in awareness of chemical, biological, and radiological weapons. 35 Local hospitals were updated to include mass decontamination units. Local EMS providers were given uniform operational plans and procedures, enhanced communications were agreed on, protocols were developed for the management of heat-related illnesses, and guidelines for response to mass casualties were issued. Public health initiatives to address heat-related illnesses included a media campaign; packets sent to ticket purchasers; shelters; and provision of water, wide-brimmed hats, sunscreen, and water misters at the most crowded sites. These, plus the cooler-than-normal temperatures, may have led to a decrease in the expected number of hyperthermia victims. Organizers of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa developed an infectious disease surveillance system for the event, which reported to a national health operations center. Despite taking place over a month during the peak of the influenza season in South Africa (in anticipation of which WHO donated 3.5 million doses of pandemic H1N1 vaccine), only 30 communicable disease events were reported. 36 ",

Major and minor trauma results from falls, assaults, being crushed against barriers, and head injuries from assorted \"missiles.\" Anticipated medical problems include headaches, syncope, hyperventilation, asthma, epilepsy, and hypoglycemia. At the Atlanta Olympics, most of the injuries were sprains or strains (13%) and contusion abrasions (7%); bronchitis was common (9%), and heat cramps and dehydration accounted for 7% of those seeking medical care. 33 In addition, three cardiac arrests were reported; the provision of defibrillators at mass gatherings is an important consideration. 43 Hyponatremia is increasingly prevalent among marathon runners. It is defined as a serum sodium level of less than 136 mmol/L and is commonly caused by overhydration. Mild cases may be treated by fluid restriction and consumption of salty foods until urination resumes. In moderate cases the patient's sodium level may need to be checked hourly and, in critical cases, intravenous access will be required and diuretics and hypertonic saline may be administered. Complications such as seizures, pulmonary edema, and coma should be treated appropriately. Runners should be encouraged to replace only 16 ounces of fluid along with salt for every pound of weight lost. Exercise-associated collapse may occur at the finish due to venous pooling. This may be treated by laying the patient supine with the legs elevated and rehydrating with oral electrolyte or carbohydrate solution. Dehydration should be assessed clinically and treated with oral fluids. Heat-related illnesses are addressed in the usual fashion. Hypoglycemia is treated with oral or intravenous glucose replacement. Many pilgrims are in poor health before the event and may need more than minor first aid. Many suffer from heat-related illnesses or infectious diseases. Provision of free medical care and on-site medical facilities with capabilities of providing even an intensive care unit level of care may meet these needs.",
