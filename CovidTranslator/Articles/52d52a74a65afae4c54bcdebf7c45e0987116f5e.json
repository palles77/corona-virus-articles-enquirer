In this chapter, we examine in detail how biosurveillance systems detect and characterize outbreaks. We introduce an important distinction between case detection and outbreak detection. We discuss outbreak characterization, which is the process by which investigators elucidate characteristics of an outbreak that are important for disease control (e.g., causative biological agent, source, and route of transmission). We break down and analyze biosurveillance in this manner so that it can be modeled more formally, which is a prerequisite to providing computer support. ",

People (e.g., physicians, veterinarians, nurse practitioners, infection control practitioners, medical examiners, and pathologists) and laboratories detect cases.

If the sick individual is a person, the clinician reports the case to a state or local health department. If the sick individual is an animal, the clinician reports the case to a state department of agriculture (see Chapter 7).

The strength of laboratories as case detectors is that they are process oriented; therefore, they may report cases more reliably than can busy clinicians. A weakness is that there is not a definitive diagnostic test for every disease. A laboratory cannot detect a case unless a sick individual sees a clinician, who must suspect the disease and order a definitive test. Furthermore, not every individual for whom a test is ordered will comply and have the test done, and for some individuals with an illness, the test can be negative.

The clinicians record whether the patient meets the case definition for one or more syndromes of interest (Figure 3 .4). Hospital staff, an epidemiologist, or an assistant then transcribes the data from the form into a database. Sydney, Salt Lake City, and Athens used a surveillance variant during their Olympic Games that eliminated the need for physicians to fill out a form for each patient (Meehan et al., 1998; Dafni et al., 2004; Mundorff et al., 2004) . Health department personnel visited each emergency department on a daily or more frequent basis and reviewed patient logs (and in some cases charts) to extract the required information.",

When resources do not allow a case investigation on every notifiable disease, a health department must decide which reported diseases to investigate. Some investigations are so important (sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis) that the federal government provides substantial resources to health departments to ensure that sufficient resources are available for investigation. The investigator may use CDC disease-specific reporting forms, department-generated interview forms, or computer-generated dynamic questionnaires to collect additional disease specific information from clinicians, infection control nurses, and/or patients. The questions explore the more common sources and exposures for the disease. If appropriate, the investigator contacts exposed individuals to provide information, screening, medication, and/or vaccination as appropriate to the disease and circumstances of exposure.

A biosurveillance system must detect an outbreak as quickly as possible to enable treatment of those already sick and to prevent further illness. The required timeliness varies by biological agent and route of transmission. Early detection is usually expensive, so the exact relationship between morbidity and mortality and time of detection for each type of outbreak is important. An outbreak of anthrax due to aerosol release, for example, must be detected within days of release or, ideally, at the moment of release because many people will sicken and die within days of the release. Therefore, significant resources should be expended to accomplish detection as close to day zero as possible. In contrast, detection of some diseases, even those as virulent as smallpox, as late as weeks from the onset of symptoms in the first case is still within the window of opportunity to reduce considerably mortality and morbidity (Meltzer et al., 2001) .",

The spatial distribution of cases often provides a strong clue about the source of an outbreak. Because of the importance of spatial analysis, one of the first stories told to epidemiologists in training is the John Snow cholera story (Snow, 1855) . Dr. John Snow, a London anesthesiologist and pioneer of the science of epidemiology, decided to test his hypothesis that cholera outbreaks were a result of contamination of the water supply, a view contrary to the medical beliefs of the time. He plotted the home address of people who died of cholera on a map of London; he also marked the location of neighborhood water pumps, which were the source of drinking water at the time. The striking cluster he found of cholera deaths centered on water pumps has become legendary. The concentration of cholera deaths around the Broad Street pump was twice the number of deaths in the rest of the city of London, with approximately 500 deaths in the neighborhood in 10 days. At the beginning of an investigation, the investigators may only have the home address of each reported case. Therefore, the map they plot first is typically the home address of each case. During the course of an investigation, they may create many maps as they test hypotheses that the exposures may have occurred at work, school, a restaurant, fruit stand, or events such as conventions, picnics, and sporting events. Investigators may also map the location of individuals not affected. Snow did this and demonstrated that there were no cholera fatalities among brewery workers on Broad Street; these men had an allowance of free beer every day, which they apparently preferred to the water from the Broad Street pump.",

They can ask and answer questions such as the following: If I were to map the people in a community who developed pneumonia in the past week by using their work addresses, would the cases cluster in particular hospitals? This type of analysis would be very useful in SARS surveillance as SARS caused many hospital-based outbreaks in 2003. This type of analysis can be done routinely (e.g., daily or more frequently) even in the absence of a known outbreak as a method of outbreak detection. Spatial scans are an example of how the distinction between outbreak detection and characterization is blurring.

If the epidemic curve rises more gradually, an investigator would suspect a communicable disease such as measles, in which the number of cases increases in an exponential fashion owing to successive generations of infection ( Figure 3 .8, right).

Disease incidence is the number of new cases in a population during a defined period such as a week. If disease incidence for every day or week during an outbreak is plotted, the result is an epidemic curve. For lethal diseases, investigators gauge the severity (virulence) of the disease by the case fatality rate, which is the probability of death among diagnosed cases. Recall that investigators observed a 30% case fatality rate for the outbreak that they initially thought was Japanese encephalitis; however, the case fatality rate was highly atypical of Japanese encephalitis and led them to suspect a different disease. Investigators also compute other mortality rates. Age-specific mortality rates, for example, can help characterize an outbreak that is poorly understood by revealing that the disease affects the elderly or young with greater frequency or severity. If investigators suspect an environmental exposure, they will calculate the attack rate, which is the fraction of people or animals exposed to a specific factor (e.g., macaroni salad or another infected individual) who subsequently contract the disease. If the attack rate in a population that is exposed to a specific factor is higher than a comparison group that is not exposed to the factor, it suggests a possible link between the factor and illness. If the analysis includes a comparison with a carefully matched control population of individuals known not to have the disease, the analysis is called a case-control study (described below). An investigator would conduct a case-control study if the less formal measurement of attack rate did not produce a definitive answer to the outbreak characteristic in question (e.g., if it did not point to macaroni salad, then the more formal case-control study likely would have).",

Postal workers delivered the envelopes to the addressees, who opened them, allowing the spores to float into the air in buildings.

Molecular subtyping identified the isolate from the 94-year-old woman as matching the isolates from the other anthrax patients infected through mail. The investigators did not find matching isolates in the woman's home or in any of the places she regularly visited. They did learn by going through her garbage that she regularly tore her bulk mail in half before discarding. And they found that bulk mail that was processed and delivered by her local mail distribution center had been processed in another post office in the 24 hours after heavily contaminated letters. Evidence that at least some of that bulk mail was cross-contaminated came when matching isolates were found on her local bulk mail processing machines. Investigators believe this woman's advanced age, medical condition, and habit of ripping junk mail in half before discarding it contributed to infection from a very low level of contamination of the mail she received.

They arrive at the scene of an outbreak, assimilate the information available from patients and other observers, collect clues, and generate hypotheses about the culprit (the biological agent) and his accomplices (food, water, mail). Their secret: exhaustive knowledge about the modus operandi of hundreds of biological agents produced by scientific studies of past outbreaks.
