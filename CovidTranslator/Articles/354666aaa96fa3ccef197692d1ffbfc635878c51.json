Their in vivo anticonvulsant screenings were performed by two most adopted seizure models, maximal electroshock seizure (MES) and subcutaneous pentylenetetrazole (scPTZ). Compound 5f was found active in MES screening while compounds 5h, 5i, 5k and 5l showed significant anticonvulsant activity in both the screenings and were devoid of any neurotoxicity. Compound 5h and 5i showed marked protection at 300 mg/kg against MES and scPTZ screening. Compound 5i also showed protection against MES screening at the dose of 100 mg/kg. In 6 Hz screening these two compounds showed significant protection and emerged as lead compounds for future investigations.",

It has been estimated that about 20% of the patients with epilepsy using the first generation of antiepileptic drugs (Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, Sodium valproate and Diazepam) were not able to acquire adequate control of seizure [1] . In fact, epilepsy is the third most frequent neurological disorder encountered in the elderly after cerebrovascular disease and dementia [2] . There is continuing demand for new anticonvulsant agents as several of the currently available antiepileptic drugs (AED) have been associated with severe side effects and fail to control seizures in about 30% of epileptic patients [3e5] . The search for antiepileptic agents with more selectivity and lower toxicity continues to be an area of investigation in medicinal chemistry.",

In this study, we attempted to correlate the anticonvulsant activity of synthesized compounds with their log P value.

In this model, the presence of thioamide and amide (HBD) fragment is essential for activity. Beside this, all of the compounds contained two hydrophobic units (A & R aryl rings) as a distal binding site and Isatin as electron donar (D). Five compounds showed better anticonvulsant activity and among these compounds 5h and 5i emerged as a lead compounds in the series when they were subjected to preliminary anticonvulsant screenings. They also showed marked lower neurotoxicity and, therefore, a higher protective index. These can be regarded as strong candidates for future investigations.",

All the melting points were determined in open glass capillary using Kjeldahl flask containing paraffin and are uncorrected. Both 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker 400 Ultra shield\u00d4 (400 MHz) NMR spectrometer in DMSO-d 6 /CDCl 3 using tetramethylsilane [(CH 3 ) 4 Si] as internal standard. Chemical shift (d) are expressed in ppm. All the Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectra were recorded in KBr pellets on a Jasco FT/IR 410 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were realized on a PerkineElmer model 240c analyzer and were within AE0.4% of the theoretical values.",

After adding all indoline-2, 3-dione, flask was fitted with reflux condenser and the mixture was heated on water bath maintaining the temperature at 60 C for 1 h to obtain the desired compound 5-nitroindoline-2, 3-dione (1).

When compound (1) completely settled to the bottom, the upper acid liquor was completely poured off from the mixture.

Content was then filtered at reduced pressure and the filtrate was adjusted to pH 7e8 using NaHCO 3 to get the precipitate of compound 3a,b. It was then recrystallized with ethanol. (4a,b) . Compound 3a,b (0.01 mol) was dissolved in 10 mL glacial acetic acid and was diluted to 100 mL in a conical flask.

In order to identify potential AED with this profile, some compounds were tested in the minimal clonic seizure (6 Hz or psychomotor) test. Like the maximal electroshock (MES) test, the minimal clonic seizure (6 Hz) test [27] was used to assess compound's efficacy against electrically induced seizures but used a lower frequency (6 Hz) and longer duration of stimulation (3 s). Test compounds were pre-administered to mice via i.p. injection. At varying times, individual mice (four mice per time point) were challenged with sufficient current delivered through corneal electrodes to elicit a psychomotor seizure in 97% of animals (32 mA for 3 s). The untreated mice would display seizures characterized by a minimal clonic phase followed by stereotyped, automatistic behaviors, described originally as being similar to the aura of human patients with partial seizures. Animals not displaying this behavior were considered to be protected.",
