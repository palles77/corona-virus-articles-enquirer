The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) is responsible for regulating vaccines in the United States. Current authority for the regulation of vaccines resides primarily in Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act and specific sections of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. 5, 6 Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act gives the federal government the authority to license biologic products and the establishments where they are produced. 7 Vaccines undergo a rigorous review of laboratory, nonclinical, and clinical data to ensure safety, efficacy, purity, and potency. Vaccines approved for marketing may also be required to undergo additional studies to further evaluate the vaccine and often to address specific questions about the vaccine's safety, effectiveness, or possible side effects. 8 In the European Union, animal and human vaccines are regulated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), whose main responsibility is the promotion of public and animal health. The EMA's Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use through its Vaccine Working Party has oversight for human vaccines. Vaccines are licensed through a centralized procedure that allows for simultaneous licensure within all countries within the European Union. Human vaccines manufacturing is regulated under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Directive 200/94/EEC, Annex 16, and Annex 2.",

            "text": "The manufacture of vaccines is composed of several basic steps that result in the finished product. A summary of these steps with examples for pathogens that have a licensed vaccine is given in Table 4 -1 . The first step is the generation of the antigen used to induce an immune response. This step includes the generation of the pathogen itself (for subsequent inactivation or isolation of a subunit) or generation of a recombinant protein derived from the pathogen. Vaccines under development use additional methods that will be discussed later. Viruses are grown on cells, primary cells such as chicken fibroblasts (yellow fever), or they are grown on continuous cell lines such as MRC-5 The viral and bacterial seed cultures and the cell lines used for viral production are  carefully controlled, stored, characterized , and, often, protected. The first step in manufacture is the establishment of a \"master cell bank\". This is a collection of vialed cells which form the starting material for all future production. It is extensively characterized for performance and the absence of any adventitious agents. From this bank, working cell banks are prepared which are used as the routine starting culture for production lots. The final vaccine is a direct function of its starting materials, and a change in this seed can be as complicated as initiating a new product development altogether. The next step is to release the antigen from the substrate and isolate it from the bulk of the environment used in its growth. This can be isolation of free virus or of secreted proteins from cells or of cells containing the antigen from the spent medium. The next step is purification of the antigen. For vaccines that are composed of recombinant proteins, this step may involve many unit operations of column chromatography and ultrafiltration. For an inactivated viral vaccine, there may simply be inactivation of isolated virus with no further purification. The formulation of the vaccine is designed to maximize the stability of the vaccine while delivering it in a format that allows efficient distribution and preferred clinical delivery of the product. The formulated vaccine may include an adjuvant to enhance the immune response, stabilizers to prolong shelf life, and/or preservatives to allow multidose vials to be delivered.",

Manufacturers are required to assure that products under their control are maintained under appropriate conditions so that the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the products are not affected. 12 Currently, only a limited number of vaccines are required by federal regulation to have specified shipping temperatures. 10 Although most vaccine manufacturers use insulated containers and other precautions for the brief (usually 24-72 hours) shipping time, occasional, unanticipated temperature excursions may occur that could have a detrimental impact on the shipped product.

This vaccine is the primary method for preventing influenza and its more severe complications. 13 This vaccine contains two strains of influenza A viruses (H1N1 and H3N2) and a single influenza B virus. An additional strain of the influenza B virus has recently been added, with the first four antigen containing vaccine licensed in 2012. 13a The two type A viruses are identified by their subtypes of hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The HA and NA glycoproteins of influenza A virus comprise the major surface proteins and the principal immunizing antigens of the virus. These proteins are inserted into the viral envelopes as spike-line projections in a ratio of about 4:1. 14 The trivalent subunit vaccine is the predominant influenza vaccine used today. This vaccine is produced from viral strains that are identified early each year by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the CBER. For US-licensed manufacturers, the viral strains are normally acquired from the CBER or CDC. European strains are typically provided by National Institute for Biological Standards and Control and Southern Hemisphere strains by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia.

This vaccine built on the knowledge that heat-inactivated serum containing hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was not infectious, but was immunogenic and partially protective against subsequent exposure to HBV. 16 It was determined that the HBsAg was the component that conferred protection to HBV on immunization. 17 To produce this vaccine, the HBsAg or \"S\" gene was inserted into an expression vector that was capable of directing the synthesis of large quantities of HbsAg in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The HbsAg particles expressed by and purified from the yeast cells have been demonstrated to be equivalent to the HBsAg derived from the plasma of the blood of hepatitis B chronic carriers. 16, 18, 19 The recombinant S. cerevisiae cells expressing HBsAg are grown in stirred tank fermenters. The medium used in this process is a complex fermentation medium that consists of an extract of yeast, soy peptone, dextrose, amino acids, and mineral salts. In-process testing is conducted on the fermentation product to determine the percentage of host cells with the expression construct. 7 At the end of the fermentation process, the HBsAg is harvested by lysing the yeast cells. It is separated by hydrophobic interaction and size-exclusion chromatography. The resulting HBsAg is assembled into 22-nm-diameter lipoprotein particles. The HBsAg is purified to greater than 99% for protein by a series of physical and chemical methods. The purified protein is treated in phosphate buffer with formaldehyde, sterile filtered, and then coprecipitated with alum (potassium aluminum sulfate) to form bulk vaccine adjuvanted with amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate. The vaccine contains no detectable yeast DNA but may contain not more than 1% yeast protein. 7,18,20 In a second recombinant hepatitis B vaccine, the surface antigen expressed in S. cerevisiae cells is purified by several physiochemical steps and formulated as a suspension of the antigen absorbed on aluminum hydroxide. The procedures used in its manufacturing result in a product that contains no more than 5% yeast protein. No substances of human origin are used in its manufacture. 19 Vaccines against hepatitis B prepared from recombinant yeast cultures are noninfectious 19 and are free of association with human blood and blood products. 18 Each lot of hepatitis B vaccine is tested for safety, in mice and guinea pigs, and for sterility. 18 QC product testing for purity and identity includes numerous chemical, biochemical, and physical assays on the final product to assure thorough characterization and lot-to-lot consistency. Quantitative immunoassays using monoclonal antibodies can be used to measure the presence of high levels of key epitopes on the yeast-derived HbsAg. A mouse potency assay is also used to measure the immunogenicity of hepatitis B vaccines. The effective dose capable of seroconverting 50% of the mice (ED 50 ) is calculated. 20 Hepatitis B vaccines are sterile suspensions for intramuscular injection. The vaccine is supplied in four formulations: pediatric, adolescent/high-risk infant, adult, and dialysis.",

VLPs have been produced for a wide range of taxonomically and structurally distinct viruses and have unique potential advantages in terms of safety and immunogenicity over previous approaches. 1 Attenuation or inactivation of the VLP is not required; this is particularly important as epitopes are commonly modified by inactivation treatments. 24 However, if a viral vector (eg, baculovirus) is used as the expression system, inactivation may be required if the purification process cannot eliminate residual viral activity.",

A number of expression systems have been demonstrated to manufacture multimeric VLPs, including the baculovirus expression system (BVES) in Sf9 and High Five cells, Escherichia coli, Aspergillus niger, Chinese hamster ovary, human function liver cells 4, baby hamster kidney, transgenic plants (potato, tobacco, soybean), S. cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293), and lupin callus with yields ranging from 0.3 to 10 \u03bcg/mL or as high as 300 to 500 \u03bcg/mL with E. coli and HEK293 (purified Many pathogenic viruses such as influenza, HIV, and hepatitis C are surrounded by an envelope, a membrane that consists of a lipid bilayer derived from the host cell, inserted with virus glycoprotein spikes. These proteins are targets of neutralizing antibodies and are essential components of vaccine. Owing to inherent properties of the lipid envelope, assembly of VLPs in insect cells for these viruses is a different type of technical challenge to those produced viruses with multiple capsids. 1 For these targets, production of VLPs is a challenging task because the synthesis and assembly of one or more recombinant proteins may be required. This is the case for VLPs of rotavirus (RLP), which is an RNA virus with capsids formed by 1860 monomers of four different proteins. In addition, the production of most VLPs requires the simultaneous expression and assembly of several recombinant proteins, which, for the case of RLP, needs to occur in a single host cell. 25 Purification of VLPs also constitutes a particularly challenging task. VLPs are structures of several nanometers in diameter and of molecular weights in the range of 10 6 Da. Also, for guaranteeing the quality of the product, it is not sufficient to demonstrate the absence of contaminant proteins; it is also necessary to show that proteins are correctly assembled into VLPs.",

In addition, the in vivo immunogenicity of the vaccine was also improved by as much as approximately 10-fold, as shown in mouse potency studies. 26 The disassembly and reassembly of particles may also be important to remove residual proteins from the expression system/host cell used in the production and is a serious processing challenge, particularly for enveloped VLPs.",

Safety, efficacy, and potency tests associated with a licensed vaccine are maintained within the approved filing and published in 21 CFR Part 610. In addition, the USP has prepared monographs for all approved vaccines to provide standardized requirements and continues to add monographs as new vaccines proceed to commercialization. 33 Most bulk vaccines must be tested for safety and efficacy by the manufacturer and CBER before release for final formulation and packaging. In the mid-1990s, CBER developed the concept of a well-characterized biologic, which was defined as a chemical entity whose identity, purity, impurities, potency, and quantity can be determined and controlled through analytical testing and control of the manufacturing process. 34 The advantage of well-characterized products is that the quantifiable analytical measurements can relate molecule structure to function. The application of this definition allowed manufacturers of biologics to eliminate the need for CBER release of biologics before distribution into the market and also allowed for process changes to take place after the product had been licensed. Current analytical and process technologies allow the application of this definition for most recombinant DNA proteins and monoclonal antibody products; however, with the exception of one currently licensed vaccine, vaccines in general do not meet the criteria for \"well-characterized\" owing to their complexity, size, and structure and the inability to fully characterize and quantify all analytical and biological parameters. 35 Recent vaccine development has focused on molecules that can meet criteria for well-characterized products. Chemical, microbial, and physical assays for vaccines are developed in concurrence with product and process development. Process step outputs are tested using a variety of analytical techniques designed to understand and characterize the structure of the target molecule and any associated impurities. Many of these tests are used during process validation activities to demonstrate the capability and robustness of the process. Identity testing of biologicals includes a wide variety of tests designed to be specific to the moiety based on unique characteristics of its molecular structure or other properties. Identity testing may include one or many complementary tests including physicochemical, biological, or immunological assays. Identity tests traditionally used were relatively simple tests, but advances in analytical technologies are providing for better specificity, which, in multivalent and combination vaccines, becomes critical to ensuring that all components are adequately distinguished. One example of an advanced technology is the replacement of multiple colorimetric assays by single NMR spectral analysis for multivalent polysaccharide identification. 36 Current methods are listed in Table 4 -3.",

Most vaccines are large molecules that depend on their biochemical makeup and physical configuration to provide the desired immunologic response. Unlike small molecules, which can be steam sterilized, most vaccines are prepared aseptically. Sterility testing is used for bulk vaccines and final dosage forms but still provides limited assurance of sterility because only a sample of the bulk and of a finished product lot can be tested. Current advances in sterility and bioburden testing include the use of process analysis technology and rapid micro testing sensitive down to one bacterial cell per sample. These are currently being validated and implemented to reduce current sterility testing time from 14 days down to hours. Traditionally, endotoxin or pyrogen testing has been performed using animal response to assess pyrogenicity of compounds. Reliance on the endotoxin limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test to assess pyrogenicity has become standard for testing new vaccines. Current testing has traditionally been performed according to the 1993 Points to Consider and ICH guidance regarding adventitious agent testing, including viral testing and mycoplasma testing.

For example, specific safety testing in animals is used to ensure effective inactivation of exotoxins produced by host bacterial cells. Advances in replacing animal testing include use of Vero cell assays, which are extremely sensitive to toxins, and assays that measure enzymatic activity of toxins. Also, biochemical assays using fluorescent peptides mimicking natural substrate have been developed for tetanus and pertussis toxins 38 Live virus vaccines also use safety tests to assure that viruses have not reverted to wild virulent types. Many animal models are used to assess viral vaccine safety. Advances in PCR technologies provide for a sensitive alternative by assessing any mutations in the genome of the virus. Quantitation tests are performed to determine the content or mass of the target active moiety in vaccine formulations through physiochemical procedures and to detect changes in the molecule over time. Traditional tests include colorimetric and spectrophotometric assays that, in general, do not have the precision and sensitivity to detect changes in the target molecule. Separation assays, such as high-performance liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis, and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, can indicate stability and lack of product degradation.

A variety of cell lines are currently under development and promise to provide a more robust system for the manufacture of bulk influenza vaccine. Cell lines under development include MRC-5, Vero, and PER.C6. 39 These processes will eliminate the risk that an avian influenza virus could infect the flocks that produce the eggs for the current vaccine manufacturing. Such an infection would potentially eliminate the supply of the vaccine entirely. A number of cell culture-derived influenza vaccines have been approved in Europe, although not at a scale capable of providing sufficient vaccine to replace eggderived vaccine or to respond to a pandemic event. Strong industry, academic, and government focus in recent years promises to advance the development of this technology. Manufacturers are developing processes to produce influenza vaccine using cell culture, which uses bioreactors similar to the 2,000 L model ( Figure 4-3 ) at the Vaccine Pilot Plant of the Vaccine Research Center, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Contrary to popular belief, there is no reduction in production cycle time for a batch of vaccine made by cell culture compared with the use of embryonated eggs, although availability of the latter can be a problem during a pandemic event. Furthermore, the limiting factor in timely supply of vaccine can be the capacity to perform the release testing, sterile filtration, and sterile filling of the vaccine. ",

These organizations allow manufacturers to work with single-point contact to procure and coordinate distribution of vaccines to the markets they serve. Examples of such organizations are the Pan American Health Organization, which procures vaccines for much of Central and South America, and the GAVI Alliance, formerly called the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. This eliminates the need to establish separate supply chain and sales channels into these diverse markets.",

These target diseases can be caused by infectious agents, cancer, or autoimmunity. Current efforts are being devoted to developing therapeutic vaccines against tumors, AIDS, hepatitis B, tuberculosis, malaria, and autoimmune diseases such as myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. 50 In 2010, the FDA approved the first therapeutic cancer vaccine, sipuleucel-T (Provenge), which is developed and manufactured by Dendreon. The vaccine was approved for use in men with metastatic prostate cancer whose tumors are no longer responding to hormonal therapy and has been demonstrated to provide for more than a 4-month median improvement in overall survival compared with a placebo vaccine. 51 The approval validates the concept of an active treatment approach such as immunotherapy, which is intended to train the immune system to attack cancer cells and potentially get a response with long-lasting effect. Though not a cure, the vaccine provides significant clinical benefit. 51 Sipuleucel-T is customized to each patient. Before treatment, patients undergo a procedure called leukapheresis to isolate antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from their blood. These APCs include dendritic cells and macrophages, among other cells, that can \"present\" markers, or antigens, on their surfaces that are recognized by other immune cells, thereby sparking an immune response. 51 The APCs are cultured with a proprietary manufactured protein. The end result is a vaccine with hundreds of millions of \"activated\" APCs loaded with an antigen commonly found on most prostate cancer cells, called prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP). The vaccine is returned to the patient's treating physician and infused into the patient, with the intent of spurring immune system cells, T cells, to neutralize tumor cells that express PAP. 51",

The development of more sophisticated engineering controls for air handling, automated cleaning, and analytical testing of residual product resulted in an FDA guideline in 1994 on the use of pilot manufacturing facilities (which are multiproduct) for the launch of biologics. 52 This has resulted in a tremendous amount of innovation in technologies that can enable rapid conversion of facilities from one product to another. Typically, cells would be grown in bioreactors made of stainless steel, as shown in Figure 4 -3 . After use, these reactors have to be extensively cleaned and tested to ensure they are cleaned adequately. Newer technologies use plastic bags, which are used once and then discarded. An example of this system is shown in Figure 4 -4. The use of single-use technologies allows faster changeover from one batch to another and from one product to another and reduced cleaning and sterilization validation. Recent reports have shown substantial savings in the cost and lead time of new facilities and a reduction in overall operating expenses using the new technologies. 53-55",

Examples of preservatives used in vaccine formulation include thimerosal (a derivative of mercury), phenol, benzethonium and formaldehyde, and 2-phenoxyethanol. Benzethonium or 2-phenoxyethonol is often mixed with formaldehyde to improve effectiveness against a broader spectrum of potential contaminants. These compounds have bactericidal and/or bacteriostatic properties. Preservatives have been necessary to improve the safety of vaccines historically, as the ability to make a sterile product through the manufacturing, formulation, and filling process with legacy manufacturing processes and facilities is challenging, if not impossible, without preservatives. Furthermore, a preservative is required in a multidose container to prevent contamination of future doses during the extraction of the first doses from the vial. The risk of an infection or sepsis due to a dose from a contaminated, unpreserved vial is considered far greater than the risk of an adverse event from the preservative itself. To eliminate preservatives, the facilities and processes used to manufacture vaccines had to be overhauled.",

In all, 5 million units (10 doses each) needed to be filled, inspected, and packaged in this period. With the elimination of preservatives in influenza vaccine, 50 million units would now need to be filled in the same time, and all existing filling lines at the manufacturing site combined are not capable of filling that number of vials and/or syringes in the time required to meet the need for the influenza vaccine demand.

It is impossible to get the contents of a single dose vial into a syringe for administration. Therefore, manufacturers need to fill extra product that will never be administered to aid practitioners in delivering the intended dose. This is called \"overfill\". Overfill for a 10-dose vial is about 16% to 24% (or 0.58-0.62 mL fill volume for a 0.50-mL dose). (Some practitioners claim the ability to get 11 doses from a 10-dose vial.) When a single dose is put into a vial, a higher overfill is needed to ensure a full withdrawable dose. For unit-dose vials, overfill is 28% to 44% (or 0.64-0.72 mL per vial for a 0.5-mL dose). The conversion of a product from multidose vials to unit-dose vials results in an additional loss of product owing to overfill of 20%. (Therefore, Sanofi Pasteur's stated capacity of 50 million doses of flu vaccine is reduced to 40 million doses by this change alone.) This change was not recognized in the rush to remove preservatives from acellular pertussis vaccines and resulted in a nationwide shortage of DTaP vaccine, as manufacturers did not have time to increase capacity before the switch.",

Syringes are more complicated to handle on a filling line and also carry a higher per-unit cost of materials, but the savings of bulk make the change positive for manufacturers who are limited for total bulk capacity. The US vaccine market has been a largely vial market. Some products have been successfully moved to the syringe in the United States as unpreserved presentations have been developed, including tetanus-diphtheria vaccine (DECAVAC).
