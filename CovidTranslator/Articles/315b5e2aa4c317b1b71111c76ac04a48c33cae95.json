The aim of this study was to compare this bacteriological examination with a serological method (ELISA) developed in our laboratory. This ELISA was first evaluated by use of artificially infected hens. During these experimental infection studies, several groups of hens were inoculated with SE, ST, different vaccines and different Salmonella serovars to calculate the experimental parameters of our ELISA. Then, in a field study, 43 flocks were followed monthly using two bacteriological samples (environmental swab and pool of faeces) and 20 serological samples (sera or yolks). Twenty-seven flocks without SE or ST gave a negative serological response throughout their surveillance. Among the 10 various serovars different from SE and ST isolated in this study, S. Heidelberg, S. Agona and S. Hadar gave seropositive results in seven flocks. Consequently, this ELISA was not specific of SE and ST as it detected serovars sharing or not common antigens with SE and ST. Seropositive results were also obtained each month for two flocks where no Salmonella could be isolated. Finally, in seven flocks found infected with SE or ST, the positive ELISA results appeared later than the bacteriological detection.

Indeed, out of the 36 flocks without SE or ST, nine were seropositive. So, this ELISA was not specific for SE or ST, as sera from conventional animals raised in batteries and in contact with various serovars were found positive. Some of these serovars share common antigens with SE or ST, like S. Agona and S. Heidelberg; but others do not, like S. Hadar. Differences in stimulation of the immune system may also be related to the invasive potential of each strain (Desmidt et al., 1998; Roy et al., 2001) . These three serovars isolated in our study from breeder flocks were also probably transmitted via the eggshells to the progeny in the hatchery. Indeed, the owners of the breeder flocks infected with S. Heidelberg and S. Hadar involved in this study (Table 4) reported that the corresponding broiler flocks were frequently infected with the same serovars. Positive serological reactions may also be explained by the possible presence of SE or ST hidden by other serovars in the same sample, as described by Van Winsen et al. (1999) on artificially infected pigs.

The difference was probably related to the delay in the transmission of Salmonella within the flock and the immune response of the birds (Skov et al., 2002) . This phenomenon was particularly observed for one of the laying hen flocks infected with SE (Table 5 , flock 2). SE was also recovered in two flocks of breeding hens but apparently without massive infection of the birds, since the serological results in these two flocks were always negative. In one of the flocks infected with ST (Table 6 , flock 1), there were several consecutive positive bacteriological results but only one positive serological result. In this flock, ST was probably established in the environment without a large infection of the hens at the time of slaughtering. With regards to the second flock infected with ST, the absence of positive serological results could be explained by the slaughtering of the hens before the infection of birds occurred. In the third flock, the serology became positive 1 month after the first detection of ST by bacteriological method. This result could not be confirmed because the flock reached the end of its economic life and the hens had to be slaughtered.",

If a country decides to use a serological method in its surveillance system, a positive response in a flock without any vaccination against Salmonella will need further bacteriological examination. This confirmation remains necessary because of a possible non-specific response of the ELISA which may lead to an unjustified chicken slaughtering and an economic loss for the farmer. The bacteriological confirmation is also necessary for epidemiological reasons (Skov et al., 2002) and regulations: Enteritidis and Typhimurium are currently the only two serovars targeted by the French authorities. Other serovars could be targeted since the European Regulation 2160/2003 (Anonymous, 2003) . Consequently, the bacteriological examination is still more suitable than our ELISA to follow the evolution of the legislation.",
