There is enhanced expression of ACE-2 in those with cardiovascular conditions, possibly accounting for the apparent greater severity of COVID-19 related illness in these patients. In one study, a majority (58%) of those with severe infection had a background of hypetension, and non-specifically 44% had a history of 'arrhythmia'. 13 Binding of the virus to ACE2 receptors in the lung and the heart initiates the acute inflammatory response. Pneumonia results, but also evidence of myocarditis; those with a rise in high-sensitivity Troponin I are more likely to require admission to intensive care. 14 There is a strong association between a history of hypertension and mortality from COVID-19. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in those with COVID-19 treated in intensive care units compared to those not requiring this level of care (144 versus 122, P<0.001). 14 This may relate to up-regulation of ACE2 receptors in those receiving ACE inhibiting drugs.

Any acute inflammatory condition can destabilise coronary plaque and triger acute coronary syndromes. A minority of patients with COVID-19 may present acutely with cardiac sounding symptoms. 13 It is not clear whether the apparent high mortality in patients with ischaemic heart disease represents an effect on ACE2 receptor expression, a vulnerability to ischaemic complications of the systemic illness or a bias against such patients when ventilatiors must be rationed. The pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its routes of systemic transmission remain incompletely understood. Observations had been noted of its neuroinvasive potential via peripheral neuronal trans-synaptic route and viral preponderance in organs with low expression of ACE2. 15 Brugada syndrome is a concern as the prolonged febrile illness characteristic of COVID-19 has the propensity to trigger arrhythmias. No such case has been reported, but like patients with heart failure and ischaemic heart disease, those with Brugada syndrome should take particular care to isolate themselves from likely sources of infection.",

Like China, Hong Kong was culturally sensitised by experience of SARS and produced swift and effective intervention to protect the public and healthcare workers, avoiding the spread of infection in healthcare settings. This involved a 3level hierarchy of control measures: administrative control, environmental control and the use of PPE. 17 Rigorous screening of the prospective patients took place to avoid bringing the virus into the uninfected healthcare environment.",
