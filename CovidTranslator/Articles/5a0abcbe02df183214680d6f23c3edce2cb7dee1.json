In general, probiotic supplements could enhance recovery and protect piglets against enteric pathogens. Seven local lactic acid bacteria (LAB), (Ent. faecium 79N and 40N, Lact. plantarum 22F, 25F and 31F, Ped. acidilactici 72N and Ped. pentosaceus 77F) from pig feces were well-characterized as high potential probiotics. Cell-free supernatants (CFS) and live LAB were evaluated for antiviral activities by coincubation on Vero cells and challenged with a pandemic strain of PEDV isolated from pigs in Thailand. Cell survival and viral inhibition were determined by cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction assay and confirmed by immunofluorescence. At 1:16, CFS dilution (pH 6.3-6.8) showed no cytotoxicity in Vero cells and was therefore used as the dilution for antiviral assays. The diluted CFS of all Lact. plantarum showed the antiviral effect against PEDV; however, the same antiviral effect could not be observed in Ent. faecium and Pediococcus strains. In competitive experiment, only live Lact. plantarum 25F and Ped. pentosaceus 77F showed CPE reduction in the viral infected cells to <50% observed field area. This study concluded that the CFS of all tested lactobacilli, and live Lact. plantarum (22F and 25F) and Pediococcus strains 72N and 77F could reduce infectivity of the pandemic strain of PEDV from pigs in Thailand on the target Vero cells.",

Among them, the group of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), including genera Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecium, is generally used as probiotics in animal productions [7] . The failure in finding new antiviral substances without adverse side effects [8] and the benefits of probiotics treatment in patients with rotavirus (RV) and HIV-associated diarrhea have led to an increased interest in probiotic bacteria as antiviral inhibitors [9, 10] . Although many researches show the antiviral effects of LAB on several viral infections in humans and livestock [11] [12] [13] , few studies report on antiviral activity using only cell-free supernatant against a classical strain of PEDV [8] .",

            "text": "The low pH (pH 3.5 to 4.5) of LAB CFS [20] may directly impair the morphology of Vero cells. Our finding confirmed that at 1:16 dilution of CFS of all lactobacilli could reduce the CPE without cytotoxicity towards the Vero cells, but not with the higher dilutions. This might relate to the lower level of antiviral substances such as NO \u2212 , hydrogen peroxide, fatty acid, lactic acid, and acetic acid, in higher dilutions [12, 13, [21] [22] [23] . Furthermore, there were no antiviral effects observed from CFS adjusted to pH 7. Therefore, we assume that the inhibition of viral infectivity presented in this study might not be derived from bacteriocins, since it has been proven to also function at physiological pH [24] . Although, the accurate mechanisms of the antiviral effects from LAB CFS are still unclear, several studies have suggested possible explanations. Firstly, the acidity of CFS might help denaturing the viral capsid proteins and preventing them from cell attachment [25] . However, this might not apply for our study since we could not use the original pH of LAB CFS due to its toxicity towards the Vero cell. The more possible mechanism maybe the hindering and blocking of viral adsorption into the cells by CFS metabolites [26] . Therefore, the antiviral substances within CFS and their protective mechanisms will be investigated in further study. The direct protective effect of live LAB cells to PEDV on Vero cells represented a possible scenario of probiotic feed supplements at the time of viral infection, without any cytotoxicity to normal Vero cell morphology. Lact. plantarum strain 25F showed the most antiviral efficacy by reduction of CPE on Vero infected cells. The minimum viable LAB concentration required to observe antiviral effects at 10 6 CFU/mL was in agreement with previous studies against rotavirus and gastroenteritis coronavirus, while the strongest effect was shown at 10 8 CFU/mL [12, 13, 25, 27, 28] . The decrease of viral infectivity in co-incubation assay could be explained by the competition for attachment to cell receptors between the bacterial cells and virus, the interference of viral attachment and cell entry, nonspecific or specific virus trapping, and the Bcross-talk^signaling between LAB and the host cells which may alter the epithelial cells leading to antiviral responses [12, 25] .",
