            "text": "A major problem in the examination of faecal material for virus particles by electron microscopy is the presence of contaminating substances at concentrations that give rise to an unacceptable background. The purification and concentration procedures currently employed depend primarily on particle size and density (Stain et al., 1972; Middleton et al., 1974) . In most methods centrifugation at low speed is followed by high-speed centrifugation, and may also involve a density gradient for concentration of particles (Flewett et al., 1973 (Flewett et al., , 1974 Madeley et al., 1977; Mathan et al., 1975) . There are a number of ion-exchange substances used to purify virus particles and their subunits in column. The basic property of the net surface charge of the virus particle has been largely overlooked as a method of purification of samples for electron microscopy. Calcium phosphate has been used to purify and concentrate viruses and their related soluble antigen by ion-exchange chromatography in column (Taverne and Wildy, 1959; Taverne et al., 1958) . We have developed an ion-capture method which has proved versatile in the routine purification of virus particles from faecal samples for examination by electron microscopy. ",

There was much less cellular and bacterial debris using the calcium phosphate method. In all calcium phosphate preparations adenovirus, rotavirus and' coronavirus particles were seen singly and in groups of two to three.

            "text": "The calcium phosphate method is superior to the direct grid method and is on par with the ultracentrifugation method. The grids prepared from calcium phosphate adsorption/versene-solubilised material by the low-speed centrifugation method showed a number of significant advantages. Firstly, there are only two low-speed centrifugation steps (750 and 2100 x g) using a bench centrifuge, making it possible to handle a large number of specimens and thus saving considerable time and labour. The calcium phosphate captures all viruses previously seen by EM methods and is effective even when viruses are present as mixtures (five rotaviruses and two adenoviruses with small round viruses). It has not been possible to demonstrate enteroviruses (polio, Coxsackie and ECHO) as they require agglutination by monospecific antisera (Narang and Codd, 1980) . Furthermore, the low-speed centrifugation preparation produced an even distribution of particles over the grid squares, making it easy to examine the grids and thus reducing the time spent on the EM examination. This is particularly helpful in the examination of the negative specimens. In addition, there was very little cellular or bacterial debris and the count of particles appeared higher, making morphological resolution clearer. The calcium phosphate method not only cleans the faecal suspension of cellular bacterial debris but at the same time concentrates the virus particles, hence less faecal material is required to do the test. The overall positive rate of 22% from unselected cases of gastrointestinal acute and non-acute illness represents a satisfactory detection rate, and is a good capture. The technique does not work well with frozen faecal material as the freeze-thaw cycle releases soluble protein which competes for the available ion sites on calcium phosphate.",
