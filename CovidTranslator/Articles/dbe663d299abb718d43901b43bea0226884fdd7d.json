At present, diagnosis relies on culturebased pathogen detection, which normally takes 24-72 h (followed by a further 12-36 h for identifi cation), is expensive, and has low sensitivity. Molecular methods have higher sensitivity and allow for more rapid detection. Multiplex real-time assays, which simultaneously amplify multiple targets of DNA in the same biological sample, are most promising for rapid, direct identifi cation of pathogens from biological samples.",

The rate of SeptiFast positivity was significantly higher in patients who had undergone liver transplantation (52\u00b73%) than in those who had not (30\u00b75%; p=0\u00b70009).",

            "text": "Afshari also reported on use of MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) to identify organisms that are difficult to detect by conventional methodseg, mycobacteria, non-fermenting bacteria. The instrument has three components: a specimen-ionisation chamber, a time-of-flight mass analyser, and a particle detector. Sample preparation is simple and involves transferring a portion of an isolated colony onto a target plate. The US Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved any commercial MALDI-TOF MS system for clinical use. However, this technology offers improved turnaround time and could eventually supplant conventional microbiological identifi cation methods.",

At the time of the conference, 77 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have been reported to WHO (40 fatal). As of July 10, 81 cases have been laboratory confi rmed. All cases have been linked to one or more of Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, or the UK. 62 cases (34 fatal) have been reported by Saudi Arabia.

Of 217 household contacts investigated, five family members and two health workers developed MERS-CoV. Interventions included monitoring of hand hygiene, provision of masks to all patients, exclusion of visitors, and testing for MERS-CoV. Discussion about treatment is ongoing in Saudi Arabia. Steroids, ribavirin, and interferon were tried in a few places without clear benefi ts. The animal reservoir also remains unclear. 1100 samples from diff erent species of bats in three diff erent locations in Saudi Arabia were analysed, but MERS-CoV was not detected. So far, there is no clear epidemiological link to exposure to a specifi c animal species.",

He reported that pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has reduced the burden of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci, particularly as causes of invasive infections, in the USA. In many countries, serotype 19A has emerged as a major cause of invasive pneumococcal disease, and both antibiotic selection and vaccination can select for these highly resistant clones. Resistance is also emerging in types 6C, 15A, 23A, and 35B.",
