Our model is initialized using the daily counts of active and confirmed COVID-19 cases across the US. Based on our model predictions for the March 14-16 timeframe, the national epidemic peak could be expected to arrive by early June, corresponding to a daily active count of \u2248 7% of the US population, if no containment plans are implemented. Epidemic peaks are expected to arrive in the states of Washington and New York by May 21 and 25, respectively. With a modest 25% reduction in COVID-19 transmissibility via community-level interventions, the epidemic progression could be delayed by up to 34 days. Wholesale interstate traffic restriction is ineffective in delaying the epidemic outbreak, but it does desynchronize the arrival of state-wise epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate the burden on limited available medical resources. In addition to forecasting the arrival timeline of the state-wise epidemic peaks, we attempt at informing the optimal timing necessary to enforce community-level interventions. Our findings underscore the pressing need for preparedness and timely interventions in states with a large fraction of the vulnerable uninsured and liquid-asset-poverty populations.",

Panel (b) maps the spread pattern of COVID-19 by showing a time series of continental US map wherein each state is colored according to the local infected fraction. Among the earliest outbreaks along the pacific west region, epidemics in Washington will reach a local peak by May 21. Immediately followed is the state of New York, wherein a local epidemic peak is expected to arrive by May 25. Alaska will experience a rapid increase in local infected fraction, which will peak around May 29, because of its frequent air traffic commuting from and to Washington. Similar trend is observed for Hawaii, where the local epidemic is estimated to peak on June 3, under the influence of high passenger flux emanating from California whose local epidemic peak will arrive around June 1. The local epidemics in Massachusetts, Washington DC, Colorado, and New Jersey will peak by the end of May, which is followed by Illinois, Georgia, and Florida, where the local epidemic peaks are expected to arrive by early June.

The previous modelling study on the COVID-19 spread in mainland China (2) has also arrived at a similar conclusion regarding the futility of mobility reduction in delaying epidemic spread. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the reduction in interstate mobility in the US could slightly desynchronize the state-wise epidemic dynamics (i.e. the moderate broadening of the time window for the local epidemic peaks shown in panel (a)). This desynchronization could potentially alleviate the burnden on the limited available medical resources on a national level. The side-by-side comparison with the forecast made on March 2 (red symbols) indicates that should an aggressive (c.a. 90% mobility reduction) traffic restriction have been emplemented two weeks before, the national epidemic peak could have been delayed substaintially. Panel (b) shows that 90% reduction of interstate mobility, if implemented on March 2, could have reduced the epidemic peak magnitude by up to 30%. However, up to March 16, the influence of mobility reduction on epidemic peak magnitude has dwindled to a negligible level. (d) show that till date reducing COVID-19 transmissibility remains to be an effective intervention approach. A 25% reduction in transmissibility ( 0 reduced to 2.01) across all states could delay the national epidemic peak by about 35 days and reduce its magnitude by 39%. A 50% reduction in transmissibility ( 0 reduced to 1.34) will contain the spread of COVID-19 (with the national epidemic peak postponed to winter 2020 and the peak magnitude reduced to 1%).

Previous modeling studies have shown that community level control measures are effective in reducing disease transmissibility, however, prolonged closures of schools and businesses, as well as limited public gatherings have negative socio-economic impacts that must be considered (30, 31) . The negative socio-economic impacts dictate that the community-level interventions can only last a finite amount of time. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand when and for how long those interventions should be put into effect, so as to maximize the net benefit. Figure 5(a) shows the output of the SEIR model under a conditional 25% reduction in transmissibility within a time window defined with an intervention start time, , and an end time, + (where represents intervention duration). Effectiveness of interventions (lasting for a variable ), which is quantified with the normalized reduction of infected population at the national epidemic peak, is plotted in Fig. 5 (a) as a function of implementation timing, which is quantified with number of weeks between and the national epidemic peak. The trends in Fig. 5 (a) show that unless the intervention could last indefinitely, a premature implementation of a finite-time intervention plan could be counterproductive. Figure 5 (b) plots the best implementation timing, * , as a function of , and a power-law relationship * \u2248 0.85 is conceived. This empirical relationship informs the optimal timing to enforce communitylevel interventions given a practically affordable intervention duration.

Our assessment was done on four core factors, (a) urgency, (b) percent of uninsured local population, (c) local liquid-asset-poverty rate, and (d) age-weighted mortality rate of the infected patients. Urgency is quantitated as the date of a local epidemic peak per the SEIR model; it identifies how much time is left for the local policy makers and disease control professionals to design and implement effective interventions. The percent of uninsured population is negatively related to the overall willingness of the local resident to seek out diagnosis and quarantine as and when the early symptoms of COVID-19 arise (32). The percent of liquidasset-poverty is the fraction of local households that lack savings to sustain above poverty level for three-months (33) . The implication of lengthy societal shutdown is catastrophical to these households or individuals because of the potential disruption in their income. The age-weighted mortality rate quantifies the magnitude of consequence should every intervention on disease containment fail and the situation evolve to disrest. A summary report (4) of the COVID-19 cases by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention has identified that the case-fatality rate strongly correlates with patients' age. The overall fatality rate for all confirmed cases in China is 2.3% (1023 of 44672 cases) (4); however, patients aged \u2265 80 years and 70-79 years have case fatality rate of 14.8% (208 of 1408 cases) and 8.0% (312 of 3918 cases), respectively. In our analysis, the age-weighted mortality rate for a state was calculated using age-specific fatality rate reported in Ref. (4) in conjunction with state-wise demographic composition (19) . Figure 6 (a) shows how each state is expected to be affected with regard to the percent of uninsured population and the liquid-asset-poverty rate. A positive correlation can be observed in the dataset, since the individuals who live on paycheck-by-paycheck are less likely to be enrolled in medical insurance. The states scattered in qudrant II, such as Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, Florida, and Mississippi, are vulnerable to the impact of COVID-19 due to their high liquid asset poverty rate. Among these states, Texas is especially notable because of the sheer amount of uninsured .

Our prognosis suggests that in the absence of disease control interventions and traffic restrictions, the nation-wide infected fraction could reach ~7% when the epidemic hits its peak by early June. If the transmissibility of COVID is reduced by 25% with respect to its baseline, the national epidemic peak could be delayed by about 34 days, along with a 39% reduction in peak magnitude. The COVID-19 epidemic in the US would fade out if a 50% reduction in disease transmissibility could be achieved across all states. Interstate mobility reduction is shown to be ineffective on delaying epidemic outbreak, but a wholesale interstate traffic restrictions slightly desynchronizes the arrival of state-wise local epidemic peaks, which could potentially alleviate burdens on medical resources. The timing of implementation of large scale disease control intervention is crucial, especially when the local population cannot withstand a lengthy society shutdown. State-by-state analysis shows that the state of Washington, New York, Washington DC, Massachusetts, Alaska, Louisiana, Colorado, and Vermont could be impacted by an earlier arrival of local epidemic peaks than the rest of the country. Texas, Georgia, Oklahoma, and Florida face the risks posed by their large uninsured population and high liquid asset poverty rate.

A 25% reduction in transmissibility ( 0 reduced to 2.01) across all states could delay the national epidemic peak by about 35 days and reduce its magnitude by 39%. A 50% reduction in transmissibility ( 0 reduced to 1.34) will contain the spread of COVID-19 (with the national epidemic peak postponed to winter 2020 and the peak magnitude reduced to 1%). These observations agree with Ref. (2) wherein a forecast of epidemic dynamics in China was made. The influence of transmissibility reduction on state-wise epidemic dynamics is uniform. Reduction in disease transmissibility can be achieved via a variety of control measures. For example, individual level measures include practices such as improving personal hygiene and maintaining social distance. Studies of past epidemics have shown that individual-scale control measures as simple as hand washing can reduce the risk of non-specific respiratory infection by 6%-44%, and was an effective method to control the transmissibility of SARS (25, 26). Another frequently adopted individual level practice is the use of masks, however, till date no consensus has been reached on its effectiveness (27-29). Community level interventions include strategies such as contact tracing and quarantine, business and school closure, and restricting mass public gatherings.",
