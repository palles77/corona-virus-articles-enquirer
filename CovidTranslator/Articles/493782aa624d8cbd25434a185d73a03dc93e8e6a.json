There are two commonly used methods for validating the antiviral activity of antimicrobial agents; these are the suspension and surface tests. The suspension test involves exposure of a known virus titre to the agent over time, then determining the amount of infective vrirus remaining during, and at the end, of incubation. Normal conditions include incubation times of up to 10 min at room temperature.2-s Surface tests involve drying a viral suspension of known titre on a hard or porous surface and exposing the surface to the germicide for the required length of time.",

The methodology employed was based on the protocol of the European disinfectant tests for bactericidal activity from the CEN Technical Committee TC216, and specifically on the so called Phase 2 Step 1 test for disinfectant products for use on surfaces in the medical area. The active ingredient(s) of the products tested were chloroxylenol, benzalkonium chloride and cetrimide/chlorhexidine, all of which are used throughout the world for skin antisepsis. As blood spillages can pose an infection risk with HIV, this study also investigated the antiviral effect of the agents already mentioned together with the iodophore povidone-iodine against HIV in the presence of whole human blood.",

All these products could be useful in infection control programmes, both in hospital and community, particularly in developing countries. Many patients in the latter, including those who are human immunodeficiency virus positive, are cared for in the community by their own families. Antiseptics, with a combination of good bacterial activity against enteric organisms and some antiviral activity, could prevent the spread of infection in these areas. Products such as Dettol and Savlon, which are widely available all over the world, have low toxicity and a good safety record and can be recommended for use by non-health professionals.",
