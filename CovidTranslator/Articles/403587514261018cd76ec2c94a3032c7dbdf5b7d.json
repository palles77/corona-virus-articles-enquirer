For such conditions as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol values, obesity, or height, we know from epidemiological risk factor studies and from clinical management of patients that dietary and behavioral factors play on the inherited substrate to create the phenotypes. It is important to remember that, in the calculation of heritability, h 2 = genetic components (G) + gene-environment interactions (G \u00d7 E), so that gene-environment interactions are \"counted\" as part of the heritable fraction of variation (Vogel and Motulsky, 1997) . Endogenous but non-genetic factors, like hormone levels, pathways of inflammation, and neural signaling, and the enormous microbiome, interact with genetic variation. The broader environmental landscape of physical, chemical, and infectious exposures, the built environment, and social interactions surely must be considered as well. In addition, there are gene-gene interactions, transmitted epigenomic marks, copy-number variants, and alternative splicing events that must be considered in any models of heritability.",

The rest of the genome offers many possibilities of gene regulatory mechanisms, including promoter regions, enhancers, small RNAs, transposons, and even endogenous retroviral sequences. Figure 4 .1 shows a scheme from the University of Michigan-based National Center for Integrative Biomedical Informatics for exploiting multi-level 'omics datasets about the genome, gene regulation, and gene, protein, and metabolite expression that reflect interactions with external variables to produce various phenotypes. The small yield of variants occurring in protein-coding regions, let alone producing non-synonymous, function-changing mutations in those proteins, limits the interpretation of the functional consequences of these variants using bioinformatics and data mining techniques.",

In the 1950s, Motulsky, Kalow, Lehman, and Vogel recognized the importance of genetic variation in metabolism of drugs and target-based responses to drug action, and introduced the term \"pharmacogenetics.\" Studies of monozygotic versus dizygotic twins showed striking heritability for rates of drug metabolism involving diverse drugs (Vesell, 1991 1 -D im e n s io n a l a n a ly s is in the 1990s, the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) of the US National Institutes of Health embarked upon the Environmental Genome Project and established the Center for Toxicogenomics.",

Among the standard case-control, cohort, nested case-control, and case-cohort epidemiological study designs, cohort studies have the desirable feature of longitudinal exposure data collection. Counter-matching and two-phase designs permit stratification jointly on disease and exposure status, based on sampling probabilities. A variant that counter-matches each case with three controls on surrogates for both exposure and genotype can be substantially more efficient than counter-matching only on exposure, only on genotype, or neither. Family-based designs, including case and parents triads, generate a higher proportion of genotype-concordant, exposure-discordant case-control pairs than in usual case-control series. Mendelian randomization separately tests the associations of an environmentally modifiable intermediate variable and a disease with a gene that appears to influence it. For example, the gene MTHFR governs a critical step in folate metabolism; the genotype acts as an instrumental variable under the assumption that the gene has no effect on the disease independent of the intermediate phenotype (the enzyme activity). Emerging methods focus on multiple genes and multiple environmental factors related to biomarkers, pathways, modules, and functional systems. Hierarchical Bayes modeling is well suited to these studies. Applications include the WECARE study of radiotherapy-associated risk of second breast cancers in relation to DNA damage response pathways, and colon cancer candidate gene studies in relation to folate.",

Exposure variables are often complex, with continuous scales of measurement that are time-dependent, multidimensional, spatially correlated, and sometimes available only at an aggregate level, as with ambient air pollutants. With ambient measurements, exposure doses for individuals must be imputed or predicted with models using time-activity and dispersion patterns, potential chemical modifications, subsample data, and transport and fate mapping. Much larger samples are required for interactions than for detection of main effects, typically at least four times larger (Thomas, 2010b) . Measurement errors and uncertainties of exposure estimates put conclusions about G \u00d7 E interactions at risk. Another complication is the use of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), because individual genes often have multiple variants.

GWAS have been performed for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, and for quantitative traits like stature, blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood lipid levels. In general, dietary and nutrient information is not collected in these studies despite the high probability that diet is influential in these complex diseases. Similarly, G \u00d7 E interactions are typically ignored in official recommendations of daily requirements for nutrients, individual medical evaluations, and public health campaigns. For example, general guidance to increase the polyunsaturated content of the diet to decrease plasma cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease risk may not be appropriate for women with the APOE E3/E2 phenotype. Increasing omega-3 fatty acids (EPA, DHA) and decreasing omega-6 fatty acids (arachidonic acid) may be protective against coronary heart disease and prostate cancers, interacting with the 5-lipoxygenase promoter polymorphism and with COX2 variants, respectively. Intensive exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle changes can modify gene expression patterns, so it would be wise to analyze both gene expression and SNPs or haplotypes.

Most of the food types that dominate present diets were introduced only recently: dairy products, cereal grains, refined sugars, alcoholic beverages, salt, refined vegetable oils low in omega-3 and high in omega-6, and mammalian red meats rich in omega-6. These foods displaced wild plant and animal foods of our predecessors, and contribute to obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, high blood pressure, dyslipidemias, osteoporosis, bowel disorders, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, and several cancers.

The innate immune system notably recognizes common, conserved microbial antigens, now called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) through toll-like receptors. The TLR2 receptor recognizes lipoteichoic acid and peptidoglycans on Gram-positive bacterial or fungal walls, while TLR4 recognizes endotoxins in Gram-negative walls. G \u00d7 E studies have had practical value in diagnosis, epidemiological surveillance, and targeted therapies of multiple infectious diseases. Genomics has played a critical role in understanding the evolution and pathogenicity of antigenic variation of influenza strains, origins of HIV/AIDS retroviruses, transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (and other viruses) from animals to humans, spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis, and highly differential susceptibility to the vivax form of malaria (Omenn, 2010b) . Hyporesponsive TLR4 polymorphisms and a CD14 SNP associated with higher circulating levels of CD14 are associated with increased mortality from sepsis in adults and from respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in high-risk infants due to prematurity or congenital heart disease. SNPs in the vitamin D receptor gene VDR are associated with increased susceptibility to severe RSV and tuberculosis (TB). Conversely, an S180L TIRAP polymorphism is associated with reduced response to TLR2 and TLR4 activation in vitro and risk for developing TB. As more is learned about predisposition or resistance to infections, screening of potentially or definitely exposed animal-care and healthcare workers may be an important application.",

Prenatal exposures to diesel exhaust particles and environmental tobacco smoke are associated with increased risk of asthma, while maternal ingestion of fruits, vegetables, and oily fish appears to be associated with lower risk; exposure to an environment rich in microbial compounds seems to reduce the development of atopy and down-regulate tolllike receptors. Genomic imprinting and immune interactions may account for the four-fold higher risk of mother-to-child transmission of atopic disease than father-to-child.

For example, in setting the ambient air standard for photochemical smog (ozone), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stated that its aim was to protect subpopulations with asthma, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis. Asthma has a prevalence in the US of 22 million adults and 9 million children. Note that EPA did not propose to protect the much smaller (and unstudied) population with cystic fibrosis. EPA has issued an Interim Policy Guidance on Genomics (EPA, 2004) . For asthma, predisposing gene variants have been noted in genes for IL-4, IL-13, TNF-alpha, \u03b22-ADR, Fc-RI-\u03b2, and IL-4R, mediated by influences on inflammation, hyperresponsiveness to airway irritants, and airway constriction and obstruction. There is an association among asthma symptoms, exposure to cigarette smoke, and SNPs in the genes for the xenobiotic enzymes EPHX1, CYP1B1, and CYP2D6 (Kramer et al., 2006) . For COPD (emphysema and chronic bronchitis), smoking is the dominant risk factor in the US, while similar chemical exposures from stoves and open fires are more responsible in less developed countries. Still, many highly exposed individuals do not develop COPD, so there must be substantial variation in susceptibility. Outliers with very high susceptibility may be rare homozygotes for alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency; still, they require cigarette smoke exposure to develop severe emphysema. SNPs apparently predisposing to emphysema include inflammatory genes TNF-alpha and TGF-beta; antioxidant genes GSTM1, GSTP1, and HMOX-1; and the xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme gene EPHX1 (Garantziotis and Schwartz, 2010) . Meanwhile, genes predisposing to nicotine/smoking addiction include nicotine-metabolizing P450 enzymes, nicotine receptors, and genes in dopamine and serotonin pathways. Interestingly, genes predisposing to addictive behaviors also increase the relevant environmental exposure.",

Hypermethylation of CpG motifs, particularly at promoter and enhancer sites, silences gene transcription, while hypomethylation of these motifs enhances transcription. Histone posttranslational modifications alter chromatin structure. Together with non-coding RNAs and protein transcription factor binding patterns, these mechanisms regulate the expression of specific genes, at specific stages of development, and in response to specific endogenous and exogenous stressors. A convincing experimental demonstration of the profound effect that epigenetic mechanisms can have on in vivo phenotypes is the coat color of the Agouti mouse, with yellow governed by a transposable element and brown due to methylation of the gene promoter, driven by a diet rich in methyl donor compounds (Waterland and Jirtle, 2003) .

Prions exist in very different stable co-conformational states, and mediate inheritance of environmentally acquired traits. They occasionally fold into a conformation that replicates itself by templating the conformational conversion of other molecules of the same protein. Originally conceived to explain kuru and \"mad cow disease,\" de novo prion formation proceeds through a high-energy oligomeric nucleus to a well-ordered fibrillar protein polymer, which is severed into smaller, actively growing pieces by protein remodeling factors such as disaggregases, and disseminated to daughter cells. The switch to the prion state can modify cell adhesion, nutrient use, and resistance to various toxins or antibiotics, with variation according to strain backgrounds. The response to stress constitutes an evolved bet-hedging strategy, allowing a fraction of cells to try new phenotypes that may prove beneficial and are transmissible and heritable. In mammals, prions may mediate cell-remodeling processes and memory formation. Protein misfolding is at the heart of major neurodegenerative diseases and of pro-insulin toxicity in pancreatic beta-cells.",

They will be superseded soon by whole-exome or whole-genome screening services for those willing to pay. In fact, knowing one's genotype in advance before starting on a variety of important drugs with pharmacogenomic (PGx) variants affecting efficacy or safety could provide critical guidance for initial dosage and for monitoring for adverse effects. There is a valuable data resource at PharmKGB (Hansen et al., 2009) . In the example of the blood anti-coagulant coumadin (warfarin) for heart and stroke patients, variants in two major genes (CYP2C9 and VKORC1) lead to much prolonged time until anticoagulation is in the effective range. Most knowledgeable physicians currently continue to administer and monitor coumadin without ordering the PGx tests. If the genotypes were available at the first decision point, the information would surely be used and would be expected to be critical in a small percentage of cases who are extreme outliers (Omenn, 2009 ). The same might be true for the anti-clotting drug clopidogrel (plavix); known polymorphisms greatly affect the activity of this drug, used to prevent strokes and heart attacks (Hansen et al., 2009) .",

There are many potential benefits: lifestyle changes that reduce disease risk, timely screening, improved adherence to disease prevention medications or other programs, and willingness to engage family members in similar actions. There could be negative impacts, such as fatalism or reduced sense of personal control, although these have not been documented as yet.
