The cellular process of autophagy -in which compartments bound by double membranes engulf portions of the cytosol and then mature to degrade their cytoplasmic contents -is likely to be one such host-cell response. Several lines of evidence show that both bacteria and viruses are vulnerable to autophagic destruction and that successful pathogens have evolved strategies to avoid autophagy, or to actively subvert its components, to promote their own replication. The molecular mechanisms of the avoidance and subversion of autophagy by microorganisms will be the subject of much future research, not only to study their roles in the replication of these microorganisms, but also because they will provide -as bacteria and viruses so often have -unique tools to study the cellular process itself.",

It is a highly regulated process, the components of which have only recently been identified by extensive studies using yeast genetics. Owing to groundbreaking work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a host of autophagy genes have now been described, the mechanisms of action of many of their products determined and their mammalian and other homologues identified 1 . In this review, we will use the notation ATG, the newly adopted nomenclature, for the genes that function in autophagy 2 . There is a substantial body of literature describing studies in which new genetic tools have been used to show that autophagy, its machinery or both are required for many aspects of cellular function and organismal development. For example, human beclin1, a homologue of yeast ATG6, has been shown to be a tumour-suppressor gene 3 . Starvation responses also require autophagy: DAUER formation in Caenorhabditis elegans requires functional beclin1 (REF. 4) and the survival of Dictyostelium discoideum during nitrogen starvation requires functional homologues of yeast ATG5 and ATG7 (REF. 5 ). Furthermore, in both Arabidopsis thaliana 6, 7 and C. elegans 4 , wild-type autophagy genes are required to prevent premature senescence.",

Observations of intracellular viruses and bacteria within multivesicular bodies have often been reported from electron-microscopy (EM) studies 8 . In addition, an unexplained phenomenon known as hepatic 'purging' is seen in hepatitis-B-infected chimpanzees. As many as 75% of the hepatic cells in these infected animals were shown to contain viral proteins at 10 weeks postinfection, but proved to be virus-free, in the absence of extensive cell death, by 20 weeks 9 . There must, therefore, be extremely efficient antimicrobial mechanisms that do not involve apoptosis or the destruction of infected hepatic cells by the immune system. In this review, we will discuss the accumulated functional evidence that autophagy is a component of the innate immune response that has both antiviral and antibacterial functions. Although this review will focus on viruses and intracellular bacteria, several reports have also indicated interactions between eukaryotic parasites and components of the autophagic pathway 10, 11 . the sequestering membranes into an autophagosome is shown in FIG. 1 . The final resolution of these hypotheses might have to await the development of cell-free systems to study autophagosome formation. Although autophagy takes its name from the destruction of cellular constituents, it is clear that several processes constitute the autophagic pathway, including cell signalling, membrane rearrangements and compartmental mixing, in addition to the ultimate degradation of sequestered cytosol.",

The initiation of autophagy can be triggered by a variety of extracellular signals, including nutrient starvation and treatment with hormones. One target of these signals is TOR (target of RAPAMYCIN), a kinase that inhibits the autophagic pathway until this protein is inactivated by dephosphorylation. TOR is a global cell regulator that also controls protein translation and amino-acid synthesis 18 . Rapamycin and nutrient starvation cause the dephosphorylation of TOR, which, in turn, activates the autophagic pathway.

In fact, high concentrations of amino acids have recently been shown to result in the inactivation of trimeric G proteins, indicating the existence of another mechanism, in addition to the inhibition of the TOR pathway, by which amino-acid depletion might activate autophagy 22 . Many commonly used inhibitors of autophagy, including 3-methyladenine (3-MA), wortmannin and LY294002, target all cellular PI3Ks. However, it has been shown that it is the class III PI3Ks -and the phosphotidylinositol-3-phosphate that they produce -that are essential for starvationinduced autophagic signalling and autophagosome formation 21 . The autophagic sequestration of cytosol was also shown to be inhibited by OKADAIC ACID, indicating a role for protein phosphatase 2A in starvationinduced autophagosome formation 23 . In summary, the signals that induce autophagy are mediated by TOR, PI3Ks, protein phosphatases and trimeric G proteins through pathways that are, so far, incompletely understood.",

The inner membranes of these structures surround material that has an electron density equivalent to that of the cytoplasm, whereas the lumenal area between the two delimiting membranes is electron-transparent. Autophagosomes are large -with diameters of 400-900 nm in yeast and 500-1,500 nm in mammalian cells 12 -and contain cytoplasm and cytoplasmic organelles, such as fractured endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria and PEROXISOMES. Autophagosomes also contain a mixture of protein markers from the ER, endosomes and lysosomes, as well as bulk-cytosolic contents [13] [14] [15] . A list of the markers that are used to identify autophagosomes is provided in TABLE 1. The presence of markers from a variety of cellular sources makes it difficult to determine the origins of autophagosomal membranes. On the basis of ultrastructural observations and the recognition of autophagosomes by antiserum against proteins of the rough ER, the ER has been suggested as the source of these membranes 16 . An alternative hypothesis is that the fusion of small, lipid-containing vesicles forms a unique C-shaped structure, which is known as the 'sequestration crescent' . This is supported by the observation of small, membranous structures that are labelled by the Atg5 protein, which could be structural precursors of the mature autophagosome 17 . The presumed progression of this structure from initiation to the closure of the lysine residue that is necessary for conjugation do not form Atg5-Atg12-Atg16 complexes or autophagosomes, but still associate with membranes. This indicates that Atg5 itself contains a membrane-targeting domain, and is perhaps responsible for the targeting of the entire complex 17 . As shown in FIGS 1 and 2, the",

Furthermore, autophagosomes can be divided into two classes on the basis of their morphology, as shown by EM: immature (or early) autophagosomes (FIG. 1d,e) contain two or more bilayers surrounding cytoplasmic material, whereas mature autolysosomes (FIG. 1f) have a more homogeneous density and lose the distinctive inner membrane of early autophagosomes. Unfortunately, very few proteins are specifically retained in autophagosomes. Whereas Atg5 only labels the earlier autophagosomal structures (FIG. 1) , both S. cerevisiae Atg8 and its human homologue LC3 are retained in autophagosomal membranes until maturation is complete 29 .

Subsequently, correlations between the presence of double-membrane-bound structures and bacterial destruction were shown. The growth of Rickettsia conorii was found to be sensitive to interferon (IFN) or tumour-necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) treatment of host mice or mouse-derived cells, and these cytokine treatments correlated with increases in cellular nitric oxide (NO) production [39] [40] [41] . In the presence of these cytokines, EM imaging of infected mouse endothelial cells clearly showed bacteria surrounded by double membranes, and in some cases the bacteria seemed to be damaged, perhaps due to degradation 42 . It was also shown that providing an intracellular NO donor could partially mimic the anti-rickettsial effects of cytokines and that a competitive inhibitor of NO synthesis could abrogate these effects 42 . NO is known to play an important antimicrobial role in innate immunity, which suggests the possibility that NO production directly activates autophagy as a mechanism for killing invading bacteria. Alternatively, it is possible that bacteria are killed by reactive oxygen species and are subsequently taken up by autophagosomes for degradation. It would be interesting to determine whether treatment with NO donors has a direct effect on autophagy and to look for potential correlations between NO production, autophagy and bacterial survival.",

Furthermore, bacteria-filled autophagosomes have been identified by EM imaging and by the colocalization of LAMP1 and bacterial antigens 43 .",

            "text": "In contrast to those described above, several types of bacteria can subvert the autophagic pathway and replicate inside compartments that are decorated with characteristic components of autophagosomes. For example, Porphyromonas gingivalis, which can infect human coronary-artery endothelial cells, has been shown to localize to membranous compartments that are suspected to be autophagosomes because of the presence of ER markers early in the bacterial replication cycle and the later addition of lysosomal markers 46, 47 . When wortmannin was added to the host cells, which presumably prevents the initial formation of autophagosome-like structures, a qualitative change in the bacterial vacuole was seen: the vesicles resembled lysosomes rather than autophagosomes and acquired cathepsin L earlier in their formation and before ER markers were acquired. In terms of function, the survival of intracellular P. gingivalis was greatly reduced in the presence of either 3-MA or wortmannin, which indicates that the lysosomal fate that was apparently caused by these treatments was detrimental to the bacteria. natural host for Legionella, loss-of-function alleles of the atg1, atg5, atg6, atg7 and atg8 genes showed the expected defects in autophagy, but there was no effect either on the growth of L. pneumophila or on the morphology of its replication compartments 65 . It is, of course, possible that the bacterium uses different replication strategies in these different hosts. Now that analogous genetic approaches can be used in mammalian cells, it will be possible to test whether loss-of-function alleles of genes that are required for autophagy affect the function, composition or ultrastructure of the Legionella replication compartments in human macrophages. A bacterium that is closely related to Legionella, Coxiella burnetii, is the causative agent of Q fever. Like Legionella, C. burnetii has been shown to replicate within acidic vesicles 66, 67 . These Coxiella replication compartments also show some autophagic characteristics, such as labelling with the autophagy-specific marker LC3, as well as lysosomal and late endosomal markers 34, 66, [68] [69] [70] [71] . Expression of a dominant-negative form of Rab7 altered the size and number of these Coxiella-containing compartments, consistent with a role for lysosomal fusion in their maturation 34 . If the autophagic pathway is involved in the formation of these compartments, lysosomal fusion ability could affect either the autophagic induction or pregnant pause models for the bacterial use of autophagic constituents, and these ideas required for Legionella replication in human macrophages, but not in bacterial growth medium. Legionella bacteria in which the dot/icm genes are mutated were shown to be mistargeted early in infection and did not localize to double-membrane-bound vesicles, but to vesicles with late endosomal or lysosomal characteristics 55, [57] [58] [59] . Further work showed that the dot/icm genes encode the proteins of a type IV secretion system [60] [61] [62] . In the 'pregnant pause' model 11 , Legionella and other vacuole-associated pathogens enter the cell and localize to autophagosomes. Then, through the action of bacterial proteins that require the type IV secretion apparatus to enter the host cytoplasm, the maturation of these autophagosome-like structures into autolysosomes is delayed. It has been proposed that this delay gives the microorganisms time to develop into replicative forms that can withstand the environment of the autolysosome (FIG. 3c) .",

            "text": "However, the autophagosomal origin of the Legionella replication compartments has been disputed. Some ultrastructural EM analyses have shown structures that seem to be rough ER surrounding the bacteria 63 . In addition, formation of the compartment was shown to be sensitive to dominant-negative alleles of SAR1 and ARF1, genes that encode small GTP-binding proteins that are classically involved in traffic between the ER and the Golgi apparatus 64 . In D. discoideum, which is a Are there likely candidates for type-IV-secretiondependent factors that delay autophagosome maturation? The leading candidates are factors that are expressed in both Legionella and Rickettsia and that display homology to the eukaryotic SEC7 guaninenucleotide-exchange factor, which is known to be involved in membrane fusion and transport 60 . The Legionella SEC7 homologue, RalF, has been shown to be secreted in a type-IV-dependent manner, and recruits the cellular ADP ribosylation factor ARF1 to the membrane of the Legionella phagosome. It is possible, therefore, that RalF might play a role in altering the trafficking of that vacuole 62 . Although mutations in ralF did not affect the yield of intracellular bacteria 62 , it are clearly not mutually exclusive. The isolation of effector molecules that induce autophagosome formation, delay autophagosome maturation, or both, would strengthen the case for a role for autophagy in the formation of replication vacuoles and would allow the autophagy induction and pregnant pause models to be tested further. It may be found that there are common mechanisms by which bacteria subvert cellular autophagy. Consistent with this view, the dot/icm homologues that are found in Coxiella were shown to rescue the growth defects of Legionella bacteria with dot/icm mutations 72 .Whether the molecules that are transported by these interchangeable type IV secretion machines have similar functions, however, remains to be tested. (TABLE 2) . PKR was originally discovered because of its antiviral role during infection 103 . Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is often present during viral infections, either as a byproduct of the replication of RNA viruses or as a product of overlapping transcription from the compact genomes of DNA viruses. dsRNA is a known allosteric effector of PKR and causes a conformational change in PKR, which is followed by its dimerization and activation of its kinase activity. On activation, PKR phosphorylates several substrates, including other PKR monomers, the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and the eukaryotic translation initation factor eIF2\u03b1. Phosphorylation is known to increase the activity of the PP2A complex, which has many targets. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 prevents the recycling of the eIF2-GDP complex, which drastically inhibits most translational initiation -both host and viral -which requires the initiator transfer RNA, tRNA met . Some messenger RNAs, however, are selectively translated under conditions of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. These include those that require the use of an alternative AUG codon. Reducing the frequency of productive initiation can allow scanning through upstream AUGs 104, 105 . Therefore, PKR activation by dsRNA, which is usually described as inhibiting translation, is likely to have more subtle effects on translation than simple inhibition and might actually activate the translation of some mRNAs, especially those with upstream open reading frames.",

Another viral PKR inhibitor, the ICP34.5 gene product that is encoded by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), binds to protein phosphatase 1a, causing it to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 and so reverse the effects of phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by PKR 106 . Presumably, the expression of ICP34.5 -or any other viral product that neutralizes the effect of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by PKR -would also reverse PKR phosphorylation by any of the three other cellular eIF2\u03b1 kinases in mammalian cells. These are GCN2, which is activated during amino-acid starvation; pancreatic ER kinase (PERK), which is activated during endoplasmic reticulum stress; and haem-regulated eIF2\u03b1 kinase (HRI), which is activated during haem depletion 77 Cytokines factor eIF2\u03b1 and thereby inhibit and deregulate cellular translation. Herpes simplex virus 1 encodes a protein, ICP34.5, that antagonizes this function by redirecting a cellular phosphatase to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1. The reduction in herpesvirus growth that is caused by the deletion of the gene encoding ICP34.5 was shown to be completely reversed in mice that lack PKR 76 .

One possible explanation for this observation might be provided by the finding that, in yeast, mutations in the genes that encode COPII coat proteins lead to defects in autophagy 90, 91 . It is therefore possible, although it has not yet been tested, that the COPII proteins are normal components of the autophagic machinery or that they can, under some circumstances, associate with them. Colocalization of poliovirus RNA-replication complexes with autophagosomes or autophagosomal components might result either from the use of these components by the viral replication complex or the destruction of the viral structures by the autophagic machinery. If the latter scenario were correct, one would expect the pre-induction of autophagy by rapamycin or tamoxifen treatment to reduce viral yield. However, the opposite effect was produced: treatment with either rapamycin or tamoxifen increased poliovirus yield 3-5-fold (W. T. J. et al., unpublished observations). It is therefore likely that the autophagic machinery does not have a destructive role during poliovirus infection and instead contributes to the formation of viral RNA-replication complexes. If the poliovirus-induced membranes are derived from the autophagic pathway, it is probably because of the preponderance of double-membranebound structures that viral products delay the maturation of the autophagosome-like structures into degradative compartments, as has been proposed for Legionella (FIG. 3) .",

            "text": "As shown schematically in FIG. 6 , several different intracellular bacteria and positive-strand RNA viruses have been suggested to both stimulate the accumulation of membranes that bear autophagic markers and to inhibit their maturation. Why do certain viruses and intracellular bacteria use proteins, and possibly membranes, that are derived from the autophagic pathway? endosomal proteins and LC3 were both found to colocalize with viral RNA-replication proteins on these membranes 98, 99 . In addition, the degradation of longlived proteins increased from 1.3% to 2% in infected cells 98 . Importantly, the yield of extracellular virus was diminished 1000-fold in clonal isolates of Atg5 -/mouse embryonic stem cells and the wild-type yield was restored by plasmids that express Atg5 (REF. 98 ). The reduction in viral yield in the absence of a crucial component of the autophagic machinery clearly indicates that this pathway does not function primarily to degrade this virus. Instead, this strongly indicates that wild-type Atg5 is required for the formation of infectious MHV virions, either as a host factor that is directly involved in this process or, assuming that its only function in mammalian cells is in the autophagy pathway, by allowing the formation of autophagic membranes, presumably to function as a platform for RNA replication. Such a spectacular reduction in yield as a result of eliminating the presence of a certain type of membrane within an infected cell is, perhaps, surprising. When the RNA-replication complex of flock-house virus, a positive-strand RNA virus that can replicate its genome in S. cerevisiae, was re-directed from its normal mitochondrial location to the ER, the efficiency of RNA replication, instead of being reduced, was increased sixfold 84 . It will be of great interest to determine the reason for the strong requirement for Atg5 in the production of extracellular MHV. This might be because Atg5 has a direct role in this process, because it helps to induce autophagic membranes, or because of some other function of Atg5.",

FIGURE 5 compares the ultrastructure and immunostaining of Figure 6 | Potential subversion of the autophagic pathway or its components by bacteria and viruses. Proposed stages at which intracellular bacteria and viruses might induce or interfere with autophagosome development. The viruses and bacteria listed induce the formation of double-membrane-bound compartments that bear markers from the autophagic pathway. The persistence of the double-membrane-bound morphology of these structures indicates that, if they are similar to autophagosomes, their maturation into autolysosomes is arrested. In Legionella, membranes show delayed acquisition of lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), whereas the poliovirus-induced membranes contain LAMP1; therefore, Legionella and poliovirus are proposed to block autophagic maturation at different steps.

Many microorganisms are undoubtedly engulfed during the destructive process of autophagosome formation and maturation into autolysosomes. It is also likely that successful microorganisms, such as the viruses that have evolved to inhibit eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation by PKR, can at least partially avoid this destruction. Several bacteria and viruses seem to use components of the autophagic pathway to facilitate their replication. Understanding the mechanisms by which autophagic components are usurped by microorganisms and the molecules that are involved in this might be instrumental in dissecting the process of cellular autophagy, as well as in its subversion.",

It is possible that the viruses and bacteria discussed here use the highly inducible cellular autophagy pathway to proliferate required membranes without triggering cellular defences. The stepwise maturation of the resulting compartments (FIG. 2) might allow the fine-tuning of the pH, or the protein or lipid composition, depending on which steps are induced or inhibited (FIG. 6) . Finally, the cytoplasmic lumens of double-membrane-bound vesicles that are formed during poliovirus infection, for example, sometimes contain progeny virions (FIG. 4a) . These vesicles are likely to be those that are formed late in infection, so that the engulfed cytoplasm already contains mature viral particles. These virions may be destined for destruction by bona fide autophagy. However, it is also possible that the unique topology of double-membrane-bound vesicles allows a certain amount of extracellular delivery of obligate intracellular microorganisms without cell lysis. Infectious poliovirus is known to be able to exit from the apical surface of polarized cell monolayers without a breach in the integrity of the epithelial",
