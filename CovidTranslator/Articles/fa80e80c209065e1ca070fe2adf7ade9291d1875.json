The IDI has exceeded expectations, spending more than US$4 billion over four years. The IDI is a unique initiative with its own philosophical basis and specifically tailored interventions and measures that helped to initiate worldwide political and financial commitments in the fight against infectious diseases. Notably, it promoted partnerships among stakeholders and emphasized comprehensive and intersectoral approaches (i.e. coordination and collaboration between health and other sectors). It helped to create a new vision of what is possible in the global effort against communicable diseases and has been instrumental in shaping the changing environments of development assistance, poverty reduction and other trends to reduce the impact of infectious and parasitic diseases.",

At the Kyushu-Okinawa Group of Eight (G8) summit in July 2000, infectious diseases were on the main agenda for the first time, and major progress was made in securing stronger commitments from all G8 nations [2] . The commitments included an agreement to establish new partnerships to help maximize the impact of health and medical interventions, and recognition of the need to expedite the mobilization of additional resources. One of the outcomes of this new-found political appreciation of the urgent need to tackle infectious diseases was the establishment in January 2002 of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM: http://www. theglobalfund.org/) [3] .",

Even before the Denver summit, the Japanese Government was committed to fighting infectious diseases. In 1993, together with the USA, Japan launched the Common Agenda for Cooperation in Global Perspective [5] to address global problems such as increasing environmental damage, overpopulation and damage from both natural and manmade disasters. This was followed, in 1994, by the Global Issues Initiatives on Population and AIDS [6] . Japan underscored its undertaking to boost parasite control efforts by launching the Global Parasite Control Initiative, also known as the Hashimoto Initiative (HI), at the 1998 G8 summit in Birmingham, UK [7] . The subsequent Okinawa Infectious Diseases Initiative (IDI) was designed using the successes and challenges experienced during HI activities, expanding targets and strategies towards broader infectious disease control and prevention, and deploying a broad spectrum of interventions. In this article, I review the IDI, focusing on its philosophy, components, activities and achievements.",

Direct assistance involves projects and interventions that directly affect disease prevention. These include treatment and control (i.e. the provision of medicine), diagnostics and vaccines, technical assistance for disease control and training a workforce for disease control. Indirect assistance involves projects and interventions that indirectly influence infectious disease control. These include clean water and sanitation, provision of basic education and renovation of health facilities. With regard to the geographical allocation of the IDI inputs (Table 1) , Japan has focused mainly on Asia. However, more attention is now being paid to Africa because it represents the biggest obstacle to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs: http://www. un.org/millenniumgoals/), which are a series of global development targets set by the 2000 UN Millennium Assembly.",

Japan had a Japan has put great emphasis on the promotion of public health and the improvement of underlying social and economic conditions that enable infectious diseases to flourish and spread. These include illiteracy, lack of potable water and sanitation, and inadequate access to basic health services. Major importance has been assigned to water supply projects, which facilitate and promote infectious and parasitic disease control and improve the socioeconomic status of communities through reduction of the time and labour required for drawing water [30] . Japanese leadership in this respect has placed Japan as the top global donor in the sector, having contributed to more than one-third of water supply and sanitation projects in the developing world to provide >40 million people with access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in the past five years [31] (http://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/ gaiko/oda/index.html).",

The number of people infected with guinea worm worldwide declined by 99%, from 3.5 million cases in 1986 to 16 026 in 2004. Good results have also been achieved in Chagas disease control in Central America. The vector Rhodnius prolixus has been eliminated from 294 villages in nine health areas, and the house infestation rate of another vector, Triatoma dimidata, has decreased by 70% following the first large-scale vector control project in Guatemala. This project was supported by Japan and involved two cycles of residual spraying in >200 000 houses in 2004 (http://www.paho.org/English/ AD/DPC/CD/dch-jica-pjt.doc). The IDI direct assistance programme has provided several projects and interventions, varying from provision of supplies and equipment to technical assistance and training. These were planned and implemented with the recipient governments and development partners according to the needs of the countries. Some examples of the IDI projects are listed in Box 1. It is difficult to measure the impact of the IDI in terms of mortality or morbidity reduction with regard to each infectious disease because the inputs of the IDI vary according to the needs of each country. In addition, the contribution by IDI is just a part of all the efforts and interventions made by the recipient countries, donors and other development partners. However, there are some examples of the IDI having made a major contribution and having shown considerable impact (Box 1).",
