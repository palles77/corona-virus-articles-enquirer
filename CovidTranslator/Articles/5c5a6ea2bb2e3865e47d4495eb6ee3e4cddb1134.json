By paired serology, 3.9% (7 of 180) and 6.1% (11 of 180) of patients were confirmed to have acute scrub or murine typhus, respectively. The PCR assays for the detection of O. tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. had high specificity (99.4% [95% confidence interval (CI): 96.8-100] and 100% [95% CI: 97.8-100], respectively). The PCR results were also compared with immunoglobulin M (IgM) immunofluorescence assay (IFA) on acute sera. For O. tsutsugamushi, PCR sensitivity was twice that of acute specimen IgM IFA (28.6% versus 14.3%; McNemar's P = 0.3). For Rickettsia spp., PCR was four times as sensitive as acute specimen IgM IFA (36.4% versus 9.1%; P = 0.08), although this was not statistically significant. Whole blood and buffy coat, but not serum, were acceptable specimens for these PCRs. Further evaluation of these assays in a larger prospective study is warranted.",

Specimens from 180 patients recruited into a study of fever of unknown origin on the Thailand-Myanmar border were included in the evaluation. Consenting patients' 5 years of age, with a febrile illness ( 38 C) of 7 days duration and a negative malaria test, were eligible for inclusion. Venous blood (EDTA tube) was collected for PCR at enrollment and serum was collected at enrollment and Day 14 for IFA analyses. Blood specimens were aliquoted and stored at \u221280 C before testing.

Primer and probe sequences for 17-kDa gene were modified slightly from previously published assays (see Reference 6) and optimized for use on the JBAIDS platform (R17KF_4: 5 -AAA CAA GGK CAN GGH ACA CTT CTT G-3 , R17KR: 5 -AAG TAA TGC RCC TAC ACC TAC TC-3 , and RProbeV2: 5 -6FAM-CCG AAT TGA GAA CCA AGT AAT GC-TAMRA-3 ). The limit of detection was determined by testing the lowest level of spiked template that could be detected in at least 95% of specimens (i.e., 19 out of 20 replicates) and found to be 25 copies of target template per reaction. Both target assays were multiplexed with an internal inhibition control. The DNA extracts (20 \u03bcL/assay) were added to the freeze-dried reagent tubes along with 20 \u03bcL of reconstitution buffer and immediately tested in duplicate (individual reaction volume 20 \u03bcL; DNA template volume 10 \u03bcL/reaction) on the JBAIDS instrument. Positive and negative controls were included in each PCR run. The JBAIDS instrument software automatically determined the specific operation of the instrument, i.e. times, temperatures, and number of PCR cycles, and determined a result for the duplicate reactions. Whole blood and buffy coat specimens were tested for all adult patients. For children, only buffy coat fractions were tested because there was insufficient whole blood/serum to be tested.

For Rickettsia spp., PCR was four times as sensitive as acute specimen IgM tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia spp. DNA from blood are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Both O. tsutsugamushi PCR and 47-kDa PCR showed perfect concordant results; 1.67% (3 of 180) were positive for both PCRs (Table 1). For Rickettsia spp. PCR, 1.67% (3 of 180) was positive. One uncertain result was considered negative because there was no evidence for acute murine typhus by reference test (Table 2). However this result could represent a true infection by another spotted-fever group Rickettsia sp. 1.11% (2 of 180) were positive for 17-kDa PCR and the same specimens (1.11% [2 of 180]) were confirmedly positive by ompB PCR.We found that both of the O. tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia assays had high specificity and there was good correlation with the alternate PCR assays. The clinical sensitivity was low butTable 1Comparison of two PCR assays for detection of Orientia tsutsugamushi DNA from blood* *PCR = polymerase chain reaction; IFA = immunofluorescence assay; IgM = immunoglobulin M.",
