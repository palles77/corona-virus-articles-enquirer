This computational investigation of the viral protease follows protocols that have been effective in studying other homodimeric enzymes. The protease is predicted to display flexible motions in vivo which directly affect the geometry of a known inhibitor binding site and which open new potential binding sites elsewhere in the structure. A database of generated PDB files representing natural flexible variations on the crystal structures has been produced and made available for download from an institutional data archive. This information may inform structure-based drug design and fragment screening efforts aimed at identifying specific antiviral therapies for the treatment of COVID-19.",

This rigid cluster decomposition (RCD) depends on the set of polar interactions that are included, based on an energy cutoff that excludes weaker interactions. Information on the relative stability of different portions of the structure is typically obtained at cutoffs around a \"room temperature\" value of -1 kcal/mol. RCDs are shown in Figure 1 . With the inclusion of weaker polar constraints, a single large rigid cluster extends across both chains of the protease dimer. As weaker constraints are eliminated, the large cluster extends across the N-terminal domains (roughly residues 1-200) of both chains, which consist largely of beta-sheet structure, while the largely alpha-helical C-terminal domain breaks up into several smaller rigid clusters, each one a single helix. With further elimination of constraints, the beta-sheet regions become fully flexible.

The mobility studies that follow are carried out with a cutoff of -3.0 kcal/mol, similar to previous studies on enzymes [4, 5] . It is important to appreciate that even at this lower cutoff the structure is still thoroughly constrained by noncovalent interactions, as illustrated in Figure 2 . The core of each folded domain is rich in hydrophobic interactions, as is the interface region between the two beta-sheet domains as the two chains form the homodimer, and arrays of strong polar interactions constrain secondary structure (for example, the backbone hydrogen bonds within alpha helices and beta sheets).",

In both the 6Y2E and 6LU7 structures, some of the modes of motion (9-and 11+ in 6Y2E; 8+ and 11+ in 6LU7) have the two alpha-helical domains moving apart from each other, exposing a cleft at the centre of the protein that is a largely covered, narrow tunnel in the crystal structures. If the hydrophobic tethers eliminated previously were retained, the amplitude of this opening motion would be limited, but the cleft opening could still occur in the form of a widening of the tunnel. The protein structures are in this case shown in a space-filling (sphere) representation, since it is the exposure of new surface that is of interest.
