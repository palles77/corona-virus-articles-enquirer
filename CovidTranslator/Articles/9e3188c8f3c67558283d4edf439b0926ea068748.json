In 2002, lower respiratory tract infections accounted for approximately 4 million deaths worldwide and 7% of all deaths that year [1]. Therefore, there is a huge need for new diagnostic tools that enable the detection of a broad range of respiratory pathogens, especially those that are difficult or impossible to obtain by conventional culture methods.",

First, the differentiation between viral and bacterial pneumonia is often difficult, especially when atypical bacteria are involved, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae or even Legionella species; a rapid identification of the agent would allow an adequate use of antibiotics, since macrolides, quinolones or tetracyclines are indicated in case of atypicals whereas antibiotics are not indicated in viral pneumonia, thus saving resistance and reducing costs.

Excellent recent reviews are available on these topics regarding either viruses only [10, 11] , or viruses and atypical bacteria [12] . In addition to the tests targeting a single pathogen or a small group of pathogens (influenza viruses, rhino/enteroviruses or atypical bacteria), the concept of multiplex PCR assay has recently emerged; this enables the simultaneous detection of a wide range of viral and bacterial agents involved in respiratory infections. The multiplex approach was proposed a few years ago [13] but initially lacked sensitivity in comparison with monoplex techniques. The use of multiple PCR tubes may circumvent this lack of sensitivity [14] . Alternative strategies minimizing the competition between the probes have been developed to allow for the mixture of all the primer pairs in the same reaction tube without loss of sensitivity. The currently available tests, some of them from commercial source with US FDA or CE approval, allow the simultaneous detection of 12-23 pathogens, including viruses and bacteria [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

In most cases, samples cannot be treated individually and the results are usually given to the clinician 1 day after reception of the sample, which requires the onset of an empiric treatment in the meantime until the availability of the results. This also means that these tests could not be performed in emergency conditions if trained technicians are not present 24 h a day, 7 days a week. Another difficulty is raised by the interpretation of the results; whereas conventional methods or monoplex molecular techniques are limited by too many negative results, PCR multi plex assays have been shown to exhibit an important range of positive results, the difficulty being to recognize which agent is the cause of the clinical disorders and whether the association may play a role in the severity of the disease. As mentioned earlier, the role of co infections has to be evaluated in light of these new diagnostic tools. Finally, in contrast to real-time PCR, these techniques are not quantitative and the persistence of residual genomes despite the absence of replicative activity may be a source of misleading interpretations.",
