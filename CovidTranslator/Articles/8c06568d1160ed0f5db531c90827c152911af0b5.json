Genetically susceptible BALB/ cByJ mice were given an intranasal immunizing infection of respiratory-type MHV-JHM, MHV-S, or enterotropic MHV-Y. Control mice were sham-immunized with sterile tissue culture fluid. Recovered mice were challenged intranasally with MHV-JHM, MHV-S or sterile tissue culture fluid at 30 days after immunization. Resistance to challenge inoculation was evaluated in groups of mice at 4 and 30 days after challenge. At 4 days, the prevalence of MHV lesions in nose and liver was tabulated and MHV titers in liver were determined. At 30 days, the prevalence of residual brainstem spongiform lesions was tabulated and serum antibody to MHV-JHM and MVH-S was quantified by enzyme immunoassay. Mice immunized with MHV-JHM or MHV-S resisted challenge with the MHV homotype, but MHV-S-immunized mice were fully susceptible to challenge with MVH-JHM. Mice immunized with enterotropic MHV-Y were only partially protected against challenge with antigenically related, but biologically different MHV-S. Serum antibody responses to MHV supported these observations. These data indicate that challenge immunity to coronaviruses is strong, but highly virus strain-specific.",

The frequency of repeated colds in a single individual and the frequency of association with a coronaviral etiology suggest that an individual can be repeatedly infected with coronaviruses. If so, host immunity is ineffective, or effectively directed toward virus strain-specific antigens. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is an extensively studied coronavirus that might provide insight into the mechanism of this phenomenon. This virus is represented by many different strains that vary biologically and possess minor antigenic differences. Different MHV strains display primary tropism for either the upper respiratory or enteric mucosa [ 1] . They share complex antigenic interrelationships, with cross-reactivity among themselves, as well as with coronaviruses of rats, man (OC 43 group), cattle and pigs (hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) [ 16] .",

N and E 1 antigens are highly conserved among MHV strains, but E 2 is polymorphic and responsible for MHV strain-specific antigenic identity [13, 24] . E2 is the primary target for neutralizing antibody [9, 10, 13] and challenge immunity of mice to MHV can be induced by vaccination with whole virus or peplomers, but not membrane or nucleoprotein subcomponents [18] . This would suggest that effective host immunity to virus challenge is directed toward the most strain-specific antigenic epitopes of the virion. The polymorphism of E 2 possibly represents an effective survival strategy of the virus to evade immune clearance from a host population. Indeed, E 2 antigenic changes can be readily selected by escape from neutralization with monoclonal antibodies in vitro [11] .",

Immunized mice developed a low prevalence of or no spongiform brain lesions when challenged with the antigenically homotypic MHV strain, compared to sham-immunized controls. In contrast to liver, brains of mice immunized with enterotropic MHV-Y were protected from challenge with antigenically similar, but biologically different MHV-S. Brain lesions seen at 30 days after challenge were due to the challenge, rather than the immunizing infection, since mice that were immunized with TCF, MHV-JHM, MHV-S or MHV-Y, then sham-challenged had no detectable spongiform brain lesions remaining at 30 days after sham challenge. Seroconversion and antibody titers to MHV-JHM and MHV-S reflected the antigenic experience of immunized and challenged mice at 30 days after challenge (Table 3) . Sera from sham-inoculated mice (group 7) did not react with either antigen. Sera from mice inoculated only with MHV-JHM 30 and/ or 60 days prior to bleeding (groups 1, 2, and 8) reacted with both homologous and heterologous antigen in the EIA.

Mice immunized with respiratory-type MHV-JHM or MHV-S resisted challenge with the antigenic MHV homotype, but were as susceptible as naive mice to challenge with the antigenic heterotype. Mice immunized with Challenge immunity to coronavirus 193 MHV-JHM and challenged with MHV-S were not examined because of the extremely high mortality due to encephalitis among mice infected i.n. with MHV-JHM. All surviving MHV-JHM immunized mice were used to test resistance to MHV-JHM. Mice immunized with enterotropic MHV-Y were only partially protected against challenge with biologically different respiratory-type MHV-S, despite their close antigenic relatedness by serum neutralization. Mice immunized with MHV-S and challenged with MHV-Y were not studied because MHV-Y has minimal tropism for brain or liver, which were the target organs used to measure challenge resistance. Antigenic relationships among different MHV strains are complex and difficult to define. Nucleocapsid and E 1 membrane antigens are substantially conserved among MHV strains, while E 2 peplomeric antigens are highly variable, although there are conserved E 2 epitopes as well [13] . Neutralizing antibody is directed primarily at E2 antigens [10] , and is used as a measure of antigenic variation among MHV strains [8, 15] . Although the immune response is directed toward N, E 1 and E 2 antigens, effective challenge immunity appears to be E2-mediated. Resistance to intraperitoneal (i.p.) challenge with MHV can be induced against the MHV homotype by prior vaccination with inactivated whole virus or peplomers, but not with virus membrane or nucleoprotein subcomponents [18] . Challenge resistance to MHV could be conferred passively with two of three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to epitopes of E 2, but not non-neutralizing antibodies to E 2, E 1 or N antigens [9] . These observations tend to support the current findings of virus strain-specific challenge immunity. Further support includes a study in which mice immunized i.p. with live MHV-1 were not protected against i.p. challenge with MHV-3 [12] . On the other hand, mice immunized i.n. with live MHV-S resisted a normally lethal i.p. challenge with MHV-2, but MHV-S antibody neutralizes MHV-2, suggesting E 2 cross-reactivity between these strains [23] . Mice immunized i.n. with MHV-JHM were also protected against death when challenged i.n. with MHV-3 [14] . At least one E2 epitope is shared between MHV-JHM and MHV-3 [13] , possibly explaining the cross-protection. In the present study, MHV-JHM and MHV-S were chosen, since they appear to be antigenically disparate by serum cross-neutralization [15] . Under these circumstances, strain specificity of challenge resistance was apparent.",

            "text": "Although MHV-Y is closely related to MHV-S by serum neutralization [8] , immunization with MHV-Y conferred only partial protection against MHV-S. Despite the close antigenic relationship, MHV-S and MHV-Y differ significantly biologically. MHV-Y is restrictively enterotropic, with little or no hepatoor neurotropism [2, 6, 8] while MHV-S has primary respiratory tropism with secondary hepato-and neurotropism [4] [5] [6] 22] . Mice immunized with MHV-Y resisted MHV-S challenge at the nasal mucosa and brain, but not liver. This could be explained by the separate pathways by which brain and liver become infected with MHV in adult immunocompetent mice. Following i.n. inoculation, MHV can extend directly into brain via olfactory nerves after replicating initially in nasal olfactory mucosa; however, liver is infected by viremic dissemination [3] . Intranasal alpha/beta interferon treatment can block MHV replication in nasal mucosa and thereby appears to prevent spread of virus to brain, although viremic dissemination to liver still occurs [20] . Likewise, oral inoculation of MHV circumvents the nose-to-brain pathway, but results in hepatitis [3] . Immunization with enterotropic MHV-Y may induce an immune response that is localized to mucosal surfaces, thus protecting nose and brain, but not liver upon MHV-S challenge. The effect could also be a reflection of the close, but not exact, antigenic relatedness of the two MHV strains.",

Sera from mice immunized and/or challenged with MHV-JHM reacted with both homologous and MHV-S antigen. In contrast, sera from mice immunized and/or challenged with MHV-S reacted more uniformly and to substantially higher titer with the homologous antigen. Thus, the MHV-S antigen is more cross-reactive than the MHV-JHM antigen. Infected cell monolayers in which 50-75% of the cells are fused are used as antigen in the EIA [21] . Syncytia formation by MHV relies on the presence of the E 2 glycoprotein which is also the protein against which neutralizing (strain-specific) antibody is directed. The MHV-JHM stock used for 17 C1 1 cell infection produces much larger syncytia than does the MHV-S stock. One explanation for the strain-specific reactivity with MHV-JHM antigen is that relatively higher concentrations of E 2 protein may be expressed by cells infected with this virus. Thus, the EIA may, under certain conditions, be more likely to detect neutralizing antibody than enzyme immunoassays that use immunobilized soluble antigen.",

On the other hand, results demonstrate that immunized mice remain fully susceptible to challenge with a different strain of coronavirus. This reinforces the hypothesis that effective host immunity is directed primarily toward the most variable E 2 component of the virion, explaining susceptibility to repeated infections. Modification of E 2, especially under selective immune pressure, may be a successful survival strategy of coronaviruses to evade clearance from immune populations. The high mutation frequency of RNA viral genomes, the high rate of MHV RNA recombination [17] , the preferential selective pressure on E 2 polymorphism [17, 24] , and the large number of known MHV strains with minor antigenic differences [1] support this premise.",
