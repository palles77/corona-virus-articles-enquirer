Because of this, it is speculated that children vaccinated with various childhood vaccines might develop cross immunity against SARS-CoV. Antisera and T cells from mice immunised with various vaccines were used to determine whether they developed cross reactivity against SARS-CoV. The results showed no marked cross reactivity against SARS-CoV, which implies that the reduced symptoms among children infected by SARS-CoV may be caused by other factors.",

[4] [5] [6] A similar phenomenon has been reported in other countries such as in Singapore. 7 In contrast to adults, SARS symptoms in children are mild and have a shorter duration. 8 In addition, serological analysis also showed that levels of the antibodies against SARS-coronavirus were higher in children than in adults, in both SARS-CoV-infected and healthy children. 4 5 9 One speculation for the lower SARS infectivity is that cross-protective antibodies were elicited in children as a Abbreviations: SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS CoV, SARS coronavirus fig 1, the sera of patients with SARS exhibited positive reactions to several children's vaccines. However, the cross-reactions may not be directly due to reactions with SARS-CoV antigens, 10 but rather due to vaccine antigens, as the patients had been immunised at an earlier age.",

Each antigen (10 mg/ml) was coated on wells in triplicates and reacted with 1:100 diluted pooled SARS-positive sera. The positive bindings were observed by developing the standard colorimetric reaction after the addition of the rabbit anti-human horse radish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma-Aldridge , St Louis, Missouri, USA).
