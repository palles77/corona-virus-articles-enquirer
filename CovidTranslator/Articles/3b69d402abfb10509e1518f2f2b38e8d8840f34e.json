With new examples occurring approximately one each year, the majority are viruses originating from an animal host. Of the many factors responsible, changes to local ecosystems that perturb the balance between pathogen and principal host species is one of the major drivers, together with increasing urbanization of mankind and changes in human behavior. Many emerging viruses have RNA genomes and as such are capable of rapid mutation and selection of new variants in the face of environmental changes in host numbers and available target species. This review summarizes recent work on aspects of virus emergence and the current understanding of the molecular and immunological basis whereby viruses may cross between species and become established in new ecological niches. Emergence is hard to predict, although mathematical modeling and spatial epidemiology have done much to improve the prediction of where emergence may occur. However, much needs to be done to ensure adequate surveillance is maintained of animal species known to present the greatest risk thus increasing general alertness among physicians, veterinarians and those responsible for formulating public health policy.",

            "text": "Vector-borne diseases are judged as highly sensitive to climatic conditions, although the evidence for climatic change and altered epidemiology of vector-borne disease is generally regarded as particularly sensitive to temperature. Even a small extension of a transmission season may have a disproportionate affect as transmission rates rise exponentially rather than linearly as the season progresses. Climatic change can also bring about altered vector distributions if suitable areas for expansion become newly available. Again, the effect may be disproportionate, particularly if the vector transmits disease to human or animal populations without pre-existing levels of acquired immunity with the result that those clinical cases are more numerous and potentially more severe. Increased temperatures and seasonal fluctuations in either rainfall or temperature favor the spread of vector-borne diseases to higher elevations and to more temperate latitudes. 5, 6 Aedes aegypti, a major vector of dengue, is limited to distribution by the 10 6 C winter isotherm, but this is shifting, so threatening an expansion of disease ever northward. 7 The relentless change inflicted by humans on habitats in the name of progress has also had a marked effect on rodent habitats. Outbreaks of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever in Bolivia and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the United States have been clearly associated with abnormal periods of drought or rainfall, leading to unusually rapid increases in rodent numbers. Of all species of mammals, rodents are among the most adaptable to comparatively sudden changes in climate and environmental conditions. Small climatic changes can bring about considerable fluctuations in population size, inhabiting desert and semidesert areas, particularly in food quantity and quality. A prolonged drought in the early 1990s in the Four Corners region of the United States led to a sharp decline in the numbers of rodent predators, such as coyotes, snakes and birds of prey. But at the end of the drought, heavy rainfall resulted in an explosion in pi\u00f1on nuts and grasshopper populations, which in turn resulted in a rapid escalation of rodent numbers, among them deer mice carrying hantaviruses.",

This had the unfortunate consequence of reducing the local peridomestic cat population that had hitherto kept feral rodent numbers in check. The consequence of these sharp climatic changes was the emergence of Bolivian hemorrhagic fever caused by the arenavirus Machupo. This pattern of severe oscillations of rain and drought markedly affect murine species and insect vector numbers and act as an indicator that disease emergence may occur in the period following such changes. A similar pattern of events occurred in 1994 when in Venezuela an outbreak of what originally thought was due to dengue virus was in fact another example of the emergence of a novel arenavirus. 8 Table 1 The key stages in virus emergence Expecting unexpected virus diseases CR Howard and NF Fletcher 2 Evolving in the Old World, murines are a comparatively recent introduction into the New World, most probably via the Bering land isthmus some 20-30 million years ago. Whilst other rodents have declined in number, murine rodents have thrived, especially in periurban areas. This means that, although species diversity has become less with fewer genera represented, those remaining have multiplied many times over. It is among species of the family Muridae that reservoir hosts of arenaviruses and hantaviruses are to be found in South America.",

Infected immature ticks carried on migratory birds would molt in much greater numbers although such an enhancement in molting might be offset by a significant reduction in the number of migratory birds. 10 Ease of travel Air travel represents a major risk factor for the global spread of a new infectious agent. It is estimated that over 100 million passenger journeys by air are made every year. It is feasible to visit as many as three continents in a few hours. This is in marked contrast to just 50 years ago when many people rarely if ever traveled any distance from their place of residence. Frequent air travel is now regarded as a major contributing factor to the spread of emerging diseases. This is vividly illustrated by examining the rapid spread of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in 2003, when the infection was disseminated from China to at least 17 countries in less than a week. Based on the events of 2003, Hufnagel 11 have designed a mathematical model that simulates accurately the spread of SARS virus to countries that experienced four or more cases. The utility of having a model means that once preliminary data are available a prediction can be made as to those regions most at risk. Moreover, the work shows how difficulty if would be to contain an outbreak by vaccination alone, were one available. Once the statistical information is available, such a model can be used to predict those regions most at risk in the event of any future SARS epidemic. Were a vaccine available, the initial spread of virus might be contained if only a third of the population were immunized in the regions where the outbreak is focused. This assumes an index case made a single air journey. However, this increases substantially to 75% in the event of an index case making two journeys, with the whole population requiring vaccination if the same passenger made three trips. Analysis of air traffic from Mexico at the start of the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic suggests the risk of spread is particularly great when the volume of air traffic is high, but resources to report and trace diseased individuals is restricted. 12 Ground transport offers a more favorable route for transmission. Approximately 17% of all ravel in Europe is by public ground transport in contrast air travel represents less than 0.2% of all passenger kilometers traveled. 13 In contrast to airliners, public trains, buses, etc. are rarely fitted with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters.",

Once established in and around the New York area, the availability of vertebrate hosts, most notably corvids, together with optimal climatic conditions for vector populations enabled the rapid spread of WNV across the United States.

Agricultural-based societies led to humans living in close proximity both to each other and to livestock. In turn, human settlements provided fertile ground for interspecies transmission between farm animals, rodents, dogs, cats and insects. Once established in humans, the diseases could be maintained indefinitely, if the numbers of susceptible individuals remained above a certain threshold and in frequent contact with diseased persons. It is widely thought that measles emerged at this time, probably from rinderpest in cattle and diverged into an exclusively human pathogen as human centers of population grew to a level where an animal reservoir was no longer necessary. Similarly, smallpox may have evolved about 4000 years ago from camelpox, its closest phylogenetic relative. 16 Wild animal populations Among all species of mammals, members of the family Muridae have been the most successful and are found in almost all habitats. This family has species that are the natural hosts of almost all arenaviruses and hantaviruses. As noted above, rodents are highly susceptible to climate and ecological change, resulting in variable population numbers. Among the fastest reproducing mammals, field voles can have over 15 broods per year, each with an average of six pups. This in turn considerably increases the risk of human exposure to any pathogens they may carry as well as stimulating such pathogens to undergo mutational adaptations to the changing ecosystems. Rodents thrive on contaminated food and water, and are excellent swimmers. That rodents constitute an important part of the Earth's biomass is manifested by estimates of rodents consuming at least a fifth of the world's output of grain.",

Abnormal weather patterns and increased rainfall results in a dramatic increase in the vegetation providing food for rodents. Thus the environment is able to suddenly sustain a rapidly expanding number of animals. As population sizes explode, the chances of rodents encroaching into peridomestic areas and households also increases, especially when the over abundance of food comes to an end. As a consequence there is a rise in the incidence of human illness as individuals have a much greater chance of coming into contact with excreta from persistently infected animals. The chance of virus switching into other rodent species also becomes a greater possibility as rodent territories expand and overlap.",

Adaptation of hantaviruses to new hosts can stimulate the development of new virus phenotypes and hence expansion into new ecological niches. Examples of this include the divergence of Saaremaa virus from Dobrava virus: Nemirov et al. 17 have suggested this has been the consequence of Dobrava virus switching from yellow-striped field mouse (Apodemusflavicollis) to A. agrarius, the striped field mouse. The result is a virus with presumed reduced pathogenicity for humans. Other examples of host switching include transmission of Monongahela virus from Peromyscus maniculatis to P. leucopus, eventually giving rise to New York virus 18 and the crossing of Puumala virus from Clethrionomys species to Lemmus species and onto Microtus species, giving rise to the Topografov and Khabarovsk virus lineages. 19 During an investigation of the 1998 Hendra virus outbreak in Queensland, Australia, it was noticed that grazing horses often sought shelter under trees containing bat roosts. Wild fruit bats in such roosts were found positive for virus and neutralizing antibodies found in otherwise healthy bats. 20 Similarly, the related Nipah virus found in Malaysia and Bangladesh has also been associated with Pteropus bats: youngsters had been exposed to the secretions of fruit bats when picking fruit or processing date palm oil from bat-infested trees.",

The link between genetic variability and spatial epidemiology among the lyssaviruses gives a particularly good insight as to how viruses of wildlife can adapt and emerge into different animal populations. Rabies virus in Europe has switched host many times over the past century, adapting rapidly to new hosts as the virus expands into new species with time. Rabid bats exhibit abnormal behavior, losing their natural fear of humans and thus present a greater risk of transmission to humans. Despite the availability of vaccines and post-exposure prophylaxis, rabies remains a major zoonotic threat. 21 Given the increasing evidence of bats as reservoirs of emerging infections, 22 it is worth considering the evolution and diversity of these mammals. Nearly 1000 species are distributed throughout the world, with the majority in areas close to the equator where food sources are most abundant. Belonging to the mammalian order Chiroptera, bats are broadly divisible into the Old World fruit-eating bats (180 species, suborder Megachiroptera) and the microbats-some 800 species grouped into 17 families within the suborder Microchiroptera. Insectivorous bats are all microbats. Bats evolved around 50 million years ago, with the fruit bats evolving along a very different path to the insect-eating species. Bats are found in most terrestrial habitats, with species distribution varying widely, some being restricted to a single island, others being found across continents. Among the latter is Miniopterus schreibersii from which Negredo et al. 23 isolated Lloviu virus from a cave in north-eastern Spain: Schreiber's bats are found throughout southern Europe, as far south as South Africa, and as far east as Japan.",

Starting in September 1998, clusters of human cases of encephalitis began to be reported from the Malaysian states of Perak and Negri Sembilan. By far the most extensive outbreak was in the village of Sungai Nipah near the city of Bukit Polandok. Almost all of the cases had a direct link to the local piggeries, and coincided with accounts of illness amongst pigs 1 to 2 weeks beforehand. A total of 265 cases were notified, with mortality approaching 40%. In March 1999, infection developed in 11 Singaporean abattoir workers handing pig carcasses, one of which proved fatal.

The keeping of prairie dogs is common in the United States, and indirectly led in 2003 to an outbreak of monkey pox in the State of Wisconsin. 37 This totally unexpected occurrence was the result of housing prairie dogs intended for sale in close proximity to small rodents imported from the African continent, most notable rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp) and Gambian giant rats (Cricetomys spp). Although there were not fatalities among the 81 reported cases, it presented an opportunity for the spread of monkey pox into the feral mammal population of North America. It remains to be seen if wild animals become a source of monkey pox outbreaks in years to come. 38 A worrying complication is the emergence of mild human infections due to vaccinia virus, successfully used in the control and eradication of smallpox, transmitted from herds of diary cattle in Brazil and in buffaloes in India. These instances of ''feral'' vaccinia may have originated from human vaccines being inadvertently introduced into livestock from whence the virus has been reintroduced into their keepers to cause a disease resembling cowpox. 39 There is also evidence for vaccinia virus infection among black howler (Allouata caraya) and capuchin monkeys (Cebes apella) inhabiting the Amazonian rainforest.",

This virus could have pre-existed in bats or could have been a newly created virus resulting from recombination between two bat coronavirus. 43 This phenomenon may be widespread in animal-pathogen interactions. For example, studies on the evolution of transferrin receptors in canine species demonstrate that canine parvovirus is a re-emerged, and not a novel pathogen in dogs. 44 These evolutionary studies of cellular receptors provide valuable insight into the factors that govern the evolution of receptor use in cross-species transmission.",

Influenza virus preferentially replicates in non-ciliated cells of the upper respiratory tract during the early stages of the human illness, whereas avian viruses have a preference for a2-3 sialic acidcoated ciliated cells found only in the lower respiratory tract.

            "text": "Although much is known regarding the interactions between influenza A viruses and host cell receptors, there is considerable subtlety in these interactions that is not yet understood. For example, influenza H9N2 virus circulates widely in birds throughout Asia yet does not seem to cause significant human morbidity despite an increased affinity for sialic acid linked via a2-6 linkages. 46 The study of arenaviruses offers an excellent opportunity for revealing the molecular basis of co-evolution of viruses with their rodent host and their potential emergence as a human pathogen. Phylogenetically arenaviruses are divisible into Old World and New World according to geographical origin, with the New World arenaviruses subdivided further into three clades, A, B and C. Clade B viruses are pathogenic for humans and share with members of clade A an ability to recognize transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) on cell surfaces. Although both clade A and clade B viruses recognize murine TfR1, only clade B viruses have evolved the capacity to also bind human TfR1. A single amino-acid change in the viral G1 envelope glycoprotein appears sufficient for this expansion of host range to humans. Intriguingly, arenaviruses may have merged as human pathogens by more than one independent pathway of adaptation: clade C New World arenaviruses share with Old World arenaviruses an affinity for a-dystroglycan, a highly conserved cell surface protein involved Expecting unexpected virus diseases CR Howard and NF Fletcher 6 in adhesion to the extracellular matrix. In binding a-dystroglycan, these viruses can bypass the early endocytic pathway through uptake into smooth vesicles. 47 As with receptor usage, small changes to other viral proteins may have a profound outcome on whether or not a new host can support virus replication. One example is hepatitis C virus, a member of the flaviviridae family. Attempts to culture the virus in cell monolayers were unsuccessful until a strain from a Japanese patient with fulminant hepatitis (JFH-1) was isolated. This strain contains a modification in the polymerase gene (NS5A), which for reasons that are incompletely understood has permitted the generation of chimeras representing all of the HCV genotypes that are infectious in culture. 48 High rates of nucleotide substitution rates exhibited by RNA viral genomes ensure that RNA viruses can adapt rapidly to changes in the levels of host immunity, the availability of suitable vectors and the ecology of any animal reservoir. Infected mammalian cells are deficient in the necessary repair mechanisms to correct errors in template transcription: these errors are preserved if they do not prevent the formation of new infectious virus particles. For example, there have been multiple independent cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) from chimpanzees to humans, which have given rise to pandemic (group M) and non-pandemic (groups N and O) clades of HIV-1. A single amino acid change in the gagencoded matrix protein (M30R) is present in these cross-species transmissions. Furthermore, when HIV-1 encoding the gag mutation was passaged in chimpanzees, this mutation reverted. This provides evidence for host-specific adaptation during the emergence of HIV-1 and identifies the viral matrix protein as a modulator of viral fitness following transmission to the new human host. 49 A number of RNA viruses possess segmented genomes. Reassortment of individual segments may occur in the event of a single cell being infected simultaneously with two genotypically distinct viruses. Reassortment event are known to play a major role in the emergence of new influenza virus strains, leading to major changes in pathogenicity for animals and humans alike. This process is increasingly recognized as occurring among other RNA viruses containing structurally distinct genome segments, for example the bunyaviruses. In 1997, an outbreak of Rift Valley fever was detected in northeastern Kenya and Western Somalia following a period of abnormal rainfall. Around 370 human deaths were recorded, mainly in the Garissa region of Kenya. Surprisingly, however, there was evidence of Rift Valley fever virus (RFV) infection in only 23% of cases. The cloning of PCR products revealed the existence of a new, recombinant bunyavirus, one that contained the L and S RNA segments of Bunyawera virus and an ill-defined M segment distantly related to Ngari virus, a bunyavirus previously reported from Senegal in 1979. 50 Ngari virus is widely distributed across sub-Saharan Africa and as far south as Madagascar. The result in the Garissa outbreak was the emergence of a new recombinant virus with substantial virulence for humans. This new recombinant virus occurred independently of RFV infection during the outbreak, the number of infections also the result of environmental factors that equally resulted in an elevation of RFV activity.",

Following initial infection of a host cell, many host restriction factors recognize viruses and directly inhibit replication. HIV and SIV are recognized by several host restriction factors in their respective primate hosts. Tripartite motif-containing protein 5a (TRIM5a) is a species-specific host restriction factor that restricts the replication of HIV-1 in Old World monkeys such as rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys. Rhesus TRIM5a restricts HIV-1 infection by interacting with the HIV-1 capsid at an early stage of infection, and is believed to be involved in the innate immune response to retroviral infection. Recent studies investigating experimental cross transmission of SIV from sooty mangabeys have revealed that TRIM5a exerts selective pressure during the initial stages of cross species transmission to rhesus macaques, due to attenuation of infection rather than an outright block to infection. 53 However, rhesus TRIM5a does not restrict SIV isolated from macaques, and human TRIM5a does not restrict HIV-1 infection, 54 although the introduction of single amino-acid mutation in the SPRY domain of TRIM5a can restore its ability to recognize and restrict HIV. 55 Different primate orthologues of TRIM5a have recognition specificities for different retroviral capsids, and infection is only blocked when recognition occurs. 56 Similarly, apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing, enzyme-catalytic, polypeptide-like 3G (APOBEC3G) and tetherin are two host proteins that restrict the replication of retroviruses including HIV and SIV, by inducing degradation of the viral proteins and by inhibiting viral release. The retroviral proteins viral infectivity factor and viral protein U counteract APOBEC3G and tetherin, respectively. 57, 58 Recently, a study of four African Green Monkey subspecies, which can be infected with divergent strains of SIV, highlighted that even in nonpathogenic infection there is ongoing evolution of simian APOBEC3G in the absence of ongoing disease. In response to these changes, both natural isolates from long-term infected individuals and viruses from experimentally infected individuals adapt to retarget the host restriction factor. 59 These studies highlight the ongoing conflict between virus and host, and may contribute to the species specificity of closely related retroviruses. Recent studies have shed light on factors that determine the pathogenicity of SIV and HIV-1 in different host species. HIV-1 and SIV infection of humans and rhesus macaques, respectively, are associated with chronic immune activation and production of tumor necrosis factor-a from macrophages in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. 60 In contrast, in chronically infected sooty mangabeys the macrophage response to lipopolysaccharide is inhibited (Figure 2) , a finding consistent with a suppressed chronic immune activation in non-pathogenic infection that is not observed in pathogenic infections.",

Human type 5 adenoviruses use two receptors, constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and anb3/5 integrin in order to infect airway epithelial cells, although the mechanism of infection at the apical surface has been unclear since both viral receptors are not expressed at the apical side of the cells yet both are required for viral infection. CAR and anb3/5 integrin are not normally available for viral binding, being a component of tight junctions and the basolateral membranes of polarizedepithelia, respectively. However, macrophages respond to viral infection by secretion of Il-8 (CXCL8) that in turn triggers the delocalization of anb3/5 from the basolateral membrane to the apical cell surface, thus transforming the cell into a potential host for replication. 61 Thus it is conceivable that viruses crossing from one species to another may utilize secondary receptor elements shared between closely related species as a means of initiating infection in a new host. In a landmark study Everitt and colleagues 62 have shown that the action of interferon-inducible trans-membrane protein M3 (IFITM3) can profoundly alter the course of influenza virus infection in humans. The genotypes of IFITM3 found in hospitalized patients correlated with lower levels of IFITM3 expression, leading to uncontrolled virus replication in the lungs and lower respiratory tract disease in those individuals with no acquired immunity to the infecting virus genotype.",

Using well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cell sheets, several groups elegantly demonstrated that, following measles replication within lymphoid tissue, virus uses the junction protein nectin-4 to bind to the basolateral (lung) side of polarized epithelia where it replicates and disseminates to na\u00efve hosts. 63, 64 These studies highlight the necessity of using in vitro culture systems that closely mimic the physiology of the cells in vivo. 65 Ebola viruses can effectively inhibit host interferon type I responses, mainly due to the inhibitory properties of VP35.

Ebola virus VP24 also contributes to the inhibition of innate immunity by preventing the accumulation of antiviral siginal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 in the nucleus. There are some differences between how interferon signaling is suppressed between Marburg virus and Ebola virus: Marburg virus blocks both STAT-1 and STAT-2 activation through the effects of VP40 rather than VP35 as is the case with Ebola virus. 66 Recent studies have revealed that Lassa virus can also suppress interferon signaling through the C terminal domain of its nucleoprotein which both resembles and functions similar to an endonuclease.

First, surveillance is key, and for this to be effective there needs to be an effective integration of medical and veterinary public health surveillance systems, as vividly illustrated by the incursion of West Nile virus into North America in 1999. Second, effective training in the early diagnosis of disease requires an emphasis on clinicians being skilled in recognizing that the early signs of infection may represent something unique and potentially serious.
