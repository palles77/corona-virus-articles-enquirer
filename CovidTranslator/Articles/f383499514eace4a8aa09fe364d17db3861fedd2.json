Technological advancements have continually shaped the way that RNA-based measurements are used in the clinic (BOX 1) . With the evolution of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the use of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate the vast diversity of RNA species is an obvious and exciting application, which opens up entirely new opportunities for improving diagnosis and treatment of human disease. RNA-seq provides an in-depth view of the transcriptome, detecting novel RNA transcript variation 1 . Beyond operating as an open platform technology, RNA-seq has a number of potential advantages over gene expression microarrays, including an increased dynamic range of expression, measurement of focal changes (such as single nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions and deletions), detection of different transcript isoforms, splice variants and chimeric gene fusions (including previously unidentified genes and/or transcripts), and, fundamentally, it can be performed on any species.

Similar to serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE), a predecessor tagbased sequencing method for genome-wide expression analysis 7 , RNA-seq allows quantification of transcripts without pre-defining the RNA targets of interest and provides improved detection of RNA splice events 1, 6 . Unlike most historical platforms for clinical RNA measurement, such as microarrays and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR), RNA-seq is fundamentally an open platform technology, allowing both quantification of known or pre-defined RNA species and the capability to detect and quantify rare and novel RNA transcript variants within a sample 1 . RNA-seq also has a greater dynamic range for quantifying transcript expression compared to microarray technology 8 , providing the potential for increased detection of vari ation within a sample. Overall, RNA-seq can identify thousands of differentially expressed genes, tens of thousands of differentially expressed gene isoforms and can detect mutations and germline variations for hundreds to thousands of expressed genetic variants (thus facilitating the assessment of allele-specific expression of these variants), as well as detecting chimeric gene fusions, transcript isoforms and splice variants 5, 9 . In addition, RNA-seq can characterize previously unidentified transcripts and diverse types of ncRNAs, including microRNAs ( mi RNAs), PIWI-interacting RNAs ( piRNAs) and tRNAs 5 .

            "text": "Historically, gene expression analysis within the clinic has primarily focused around single gene tests using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) 131 , such as in the detection of the influenza virus 132 . This method has several advantages, including being fast, accurate, sensitive, high-throughput in terms of the number of clinical samples that can be analysed, cost-effective and requiring low sample input. For these reasons and the historic nature of this platform, qRT-PCR is generally deemed the 'gold standard' method for measuring transcript levels, particularly in the clinical space; however, there are a number of limitations, including the fact that although it is a high sample throughput technology, relatively few markers or measurements can be made in a single assay. After the initial studies describing the relatively reproducible hybridization-based methods to assess the expression of multiple gene targets using arrayed probes on solid surfaces 133 , it became clear that this microarray technological revolution would lead to new opportunities for clinical assay development. Measurement of several RNA targets at one time (as 'gene expression profiles') became associated with potential diagnostic or prognostic parameters in research. It was crucial to assess the clinical validity of these technologies for multi-gene profile tests. From a gene expression standpoint, MammaPrint (Agendia) provides an excellent example of a microarray-based clinical test that simultaneously measures the expression of 70 genes in breast tumours as a profile to help predict the risk of recurrence 134 . Although powerful, microarray-based assays can have limitations in some environments, such as those related to laboratory-to-laboratory variation in sample preparation that can affect reproducibility. Moreover, for some applications, microarray signal-to-noise ratios can affect the limit of detection. Interestingly, a number of additional cancer multi-gene profile tests are clinically available, such as OncoTypeDX (Genome Health) 135 for breast cancer recurrence risk and Prolaris (Myriad) 136 for prostate cancer aggressiveness. These tests are based on qRT-PCR technologies, rather than microarrays, largely owing to the belief that qRT-PCR is more reliable, reproducible, sensitive and accurate.",

RNA-seq-based tests can provide unprecedented flexibility, sensitivity and accuracy to gene expression measurements. Moreover, the diversity of RNA species opens up simultaneous measurements of rare transcripts, splice variants and non-coding RNA species. For example, the diverse reach of RNA species from RNA-seq is becoming increasingly relevant, particularly in cancer. In addition to providing direct detection of RNA from fused genes, RNA-seq detection of specific oncogenic splice variants, such as from EGFR 137 and androgen receptor 31 , will probably have prognostic and therapeutic relevance. Indeed, whereas microarrays and qRT-PCR are a closed platform, with clearly defined transcript detection and measurement, RNA-seq is an open platform by nature. Likewise, the ability to identify novel transcripts may introduce clinical interpretation challenges, perhaps with analogous 'variants of unknown significance' terminology found in clinical genomic DNA sequencing. Still, and perhaps more than is often appreciated, establishment and standardization of methods for assessing reproducibility, accuracy and precision in a variety of clinically relevant conditions are needed to facilitate adoption of RNA-seq tests in the clinical laboratory setting.",

While karyotyping is typically used for diagnosis of CML, qRT-PCR measurement of BCR-ABL1 transcripts is recommended to monitor the molecular response during kinase inhibitor treatment 21 . Continued advances in long-read RNA-seq technology promise to further expand the utility of fusion transcript measurements, allowing detection of mutation phasing by measuring across the full fusion transcript. Recently, single-molecule long-read RNA-seq was applied to longitudinal samples from patients with BCR-ABL1-positive CML with poor treatment response 22 . The results provided a clonal view of the range of resistance mutations, distinguishing between compound mutations in the same RNA molecule and independent alterations present on different molecules of the BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript. The authors reported sensitive detection that resulted in the identification of several mutations that escaped detection by routine clinical analysis and, for one of the proof-of-concept cases, detected a known drugresistant mutation in a longitudinal patient sample four months earlier than detected by Sanger sequencing 22 .",

There is also growing evidence that the presence of alternative transcripts can have therapeutic implications. For example, expression of the alternatively spliced androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7) has been detected in the circulating tumour cells of ~30% of men with castrationresistant prostate cancer and is associated with reduced response to androgen receptor-directed therapies 31, 32 . Similarly, expression of the tumour-specific epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) variant III (EGFRvIII) transcript is well described in glioblastoma, arising from an in-frame deletion encompassing exons 2-7 (REF. 33); clinical trials targeting EGFRvIII are underway 34 . In some cases, the mechanisms contributing to the generation of alternative transcripts may be missed by exome sequencing. Alternative breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) transcripts have been identified in a subset of patients with breast cancer who have a family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer 35 . Notably, these patients had previously tested negative for pathogenic BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations by conventional genomic analysis 35 .

Imprinted gene clusters are frequently associated with human disease, as disease syndromes can arise from alterations on the single non-silenced, parental allele. For example, Angelman syndrome, a neurogenetic disorder associated with intellectual disability, speech impairment and a risk of seizures, is a well-studied imprinting disorder caused by deficient maternal allele expression of ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A) in the brain 39 . In addition to epigenetic and transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional mechanisms such as alternative splicing and protein-truncating mutations can also contribute to ASE 40 . For example, variants affecting splicing can cause exons to be skipped leading to ASE of variants contained within the exon 41 ; likewise, a premature stop codon can lead to nonsense-mediated decay of one allele, resulting in ASE of the other 42, 43 .",

RNA-seq of lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from these individuals, coupled with the corresponding genotypes from the HapMap project, resulted in the identification of over 1,000 genes for which genetic variation influenced transcript levels or spli cing and showed high concordance between polymorphisms located near genes and ASE 45 .

Overexpression of a mutant allele may indicate the presence of an otherwise unidentified promoter mutation or intronic variant impacting splicing. For example, ASE analysis of transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFBR1) has been observed and associated with an increased risk of colon cancer, even though the mechanism for ASE has not been identified 37 . Within our own work, we used RNA-seq and ASE analysis to characterize both the chromosomal parent-of-origin and the extent of X-inactivation in a female child with mild cognitive impairment 46 . By performing family-trio (child and both parents) whole-exome sequencing and RNAseq, we defined a de novo heterozygous deletion encompassing 1.6 kb on chromosome X, which contained several genes associated with neurological dysfunction; using SNPs as phasing markers, we demonstrated that the focal deletion was present on the paternal allele. The RNA-seq data further provided the ability to use ASE analysis to estimate skewed X-chromosome inactivation, demonstrating favoured expression of the cytogenetically normal maternal allele, which we suggested contributes to the observed modest phenotype. Notably, RNA-seq provided a unique advantage over the traditional Humara assay, which measures DNA methylation of the androgen receptor gene on chromosome X, providing both a parent-of-origin and chromosome-wide view of X-inactivation 46 .",

Filtering to remove biased sites resulted in an enrichment of SNPs with ASE in genes with previously reported cis-regulatory mechanisms or gene imprinting 47 . Measurement of ASE can also be confounded by difficulty aligning RNA split reads that harbour neighbouring SNPs and small indels, which can also lead to reference-biased ASE 42 . Recent reports provide recommendations for bioinformatic analysis and data processing to address these and other challenges and introduce tools for improved detection of ASE from RNA-seq data 42, 48 . Extracellular RNAs. The investigation of extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) in biofluids to monitor disease is a rapidly growing area of diagnostic research. exRNAs are released from all cells in the body and are protected from degradation by carriage within extracellular vesicles or association with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and lipoproteins [49] [50] [51] [52] 160 . Measurement of exRNA is appealing as a non-invasive method for monitoring disease; as biofluids are more readily accessible than tissues, more frequent longitudinal sampling can occur. Transcripts from many tissue types, including neurons from the brain, have been shown to be accessible and detectable in plasma samples 53 . One obvious drawback is a lack of tissue specificity, as biofluids contain exRNAs and RBPs released from many tissue types. However, the size of the organ or tissue and proximity to the biofluid can influence the RNAs detected. For example, plasma samples have high levels of transcripts released from the Various RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methodologies can be used to measure diverse, clinically relevant RNA species. Small RNA deep sequencing uses size selection to sequence various small non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (mi RNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Precursor RNAs can be measured using random primer amplification and oligo(dT) primers can be used to select polyadenylated transcripts. RNA-seq also allows for detection and measurement of alternative transcripts, chimeric gene fusion transcripts and viral RNA transcripts, as well as evaluation for allele-specific expression. HPV, human papillomavirus; lncRNA, long non-coding RNA; poly(A), polyadenylation; qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription PCR; rRNA, ribosomal RNA; snoRNA, small nucleolar RNA; VUSs, variants of undetermined significance. liver and heart, while saliva has abundant transcripts from salivary glands and the oesophagus (K.R.V.K-J., unpublished observations). More recently, researchers are addressing this challenge by testing methods to selectively pull down extracellular vesicles derived from specific tissues, such as by immunoprecipitation for specific membrane proteins (such as L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM) for neuronally derived vesicles) 54, 55 . Use of exRNAs for cancer detection has parallels to extra cellu lar DNA in that mutations can be detected and measured in RNA transcripts, provided that the mutations are transcribed. Potential advantages of exRNAs are that there are many more copies of the RNA than the DNA (making assessment potentially more sensitive) and differences in expression level can indicate that an organ or tissue is injured or diseased, in a way that cannot be described by DNA measurements. The catalogue of exRNA contains a large number of mRNAs and a range of regulatory RNAs that can be thoroughly evaluated by RNA-seq. There is growing interest in using this non-invasive analysis of exRNAs to monitor disease, using changes in exRNAs as readouts for key disease pathways and indicators of therapeutic efficacy. Companies such as Exosome Diagnostics are developing exRNA-based Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) diagnostic tests to monitor key gene fusions (EML4-ALK) and mutations (EGFR T790M) from plasma samples 56 . ExoDx Lung(ALK) is the first such test, measuring EML4-ALK transcripts isolated from exosomes in plasma from patients with NSCLC. Notably, several groups have also used circulating RNA information to provide feedback about fetal health 57 .",

For example, unbiased non-targeted metagenomic RNA-seq has recently been used to directly detect influenza virus RNA in respiratory fluids, with additional viral pathogens detected in a subset of cases 72 . In a public health context, RNA-seq was used to track the origin and transmission patterns of the Ebola virus during the 2014 outbreak in West Africa 73 . RNA-based amplicon sequencing is also being explored for viral quasi-species (that is, mixed allele population) assessment for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HIV; such analyses are necessary in the clinic to determine the presence and relative quantity of drug-resistance mutations for patient therapy, which can occur as minor components in a larger viral population 74, 75 .

Accuracy is determined by evaluating a measured or calculated value compared to a reference 'gold standard' , with evaluation of sensitivity (ability to detect true positives) and specificity (ability to detect true negatives). The test must also provide the same or similar results with repeat testing (reproducibility) and withstand small, deliberate changes in pre-analytic or analytic variables associated with testing (robustness). Establishing reference standards and the best practices for measuring RNA-seq accuracy, reproducibility and robustness has initially been ad hoc with individual groups providing the initial steps. In 2008, Marioni and colleagues 8 provided some of the earliest technical assessments of reproducibility for measuring gene expression levels by RNA-seq, reporting high reproducibility across technical replicates for a single RNA sample. Of the genes denoted significantly differentially expressed by microarray analysis, 81% were also differentially expressed with RNA-seq, with fold-change correlations between the two technologies similar or better than those reported in comparisons of different microarray platforms 8 . RNA-seq detected ~30% more differentially expressed genes than microarray ana lysis, with qRT-PCR confirmation for a subset, suggesting a large proportion may represent true positives and this difference may be a result of the broader dynamic range of RNA-seq and/or the ability to resolve splicing changes 8 . In 2013, the Genetic European Variation in Disease (GEUVADIS) consortium demonstrated the feasibility and reproducibility of performing RNA-seq across multiple laboratories, sequencing lymphoblastoid cell lines for 465 individuals, in seven sequencing centres using a single platform 91 . On the basis of this study, the consortium proposed a set of quality checks to assess technical biases in RNA-seq data, including differences in GC content, fragment size, transcript length and the percentage of reads mapped to annotated exons 91 .",

For example, within oncology, most studies of transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq come from fresh-frozen tumour samples that are stringently collected in terms of cellularity, tumour necrosis and RNA quality, whereas most pathological samples are collected through formalin fixation to preserve the protein and cellular structure. As RNA-seq libraries are typically prepared from total RNA using polyadenylation (poly(A)) enrichment of mRNAs, this method does not adequately capture partially degraded mRNAs, as are found in FFPE samples. Given the clear challenge of low-quality RNA from clinical FFPE samples, concerted effort has focused on optimization and evaluation of protocol modifications, including rRNA depletion (ribo-depletion) protocols to remove rRNA without poly(A) enrichment 92 and the use of capture sequen cing, such as with oligonucleotide probe hybridization 93 . The utility of cDNA-Capture sequencing (exome capture and RNA-seq) was demonstrated for differential gene expression analysis from FFPE samples 94 . In addition to differential expression, this capture protocol was recently applied in the Michigan Oncology Sequencing Center (MI-ONCOSEQ) clinical sequencing programme, which demonstrated that the use of capture libraries improved performance for fusion and splice junction detection, compared to typical poly(A)-enriched RNAseq using low-quality RNA (FFPE) samples 95 . Analytical tools are also being developed and evaluated for their effect on test performance. In a comparison study of several common software tools (Cufflinks-Cuffdiff2, DESeq and edgeR) used to analyse differential expression by RNA-seq, using qRT-PCR and microarray results as benchmark standards, Zhang and colleagues 96 found that each tool had different strengths and recommended an ensemble-based approach combining two or more tools to reduce false-positives.",

One of the first sets of reference standards for RNA-seq was the development of synthetic RNA spike-in controls by the External RNA Controls Consortium (ERCC) 97 . The ERCC RNA spike-in controls contain 92 polyadenylated transcripts pre-formulated into two sets (Mix1 and Mix2), each with the full complement of transcripts spanning approximately 10 6 -fold concentration range, present at defined Mix1/Mix2 molar ratios in four subgroups. These stock solutions can be diluted and added to each RNA sample, thus providing a post hoc measurement of assay performance from a set of synthetic transcripts 98 . Synthetic gene-fusion spikeins, composed of polyadenylated RNA transcripts corresponding to known oncogenic gene fusions, are also available with corresponding RNA-seq data 99 . In late 2014, the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) project (Phase III of the Microarray Quality Control (MAQC) Consortium) 100 and the Association of Biomolecular Resource Facilities (ABRF) 101 independently reported on large-scale efforts to define the performance charac teristics of RNA-seq. Both studies represented remark able coordinated analysis of inter-sample, cross-platform and inter-site variability for RNA-seq, compared to gold-standard methods such as microarrays and qRT-PCR, with extensive use of ERCC RNA spike-in controls. Both studies extensively examined how assay differences such as poly(A)-enrichment selection or random priming plus ribo-deletion affect reproducibility. Specifically, the FDA-led SEQC study examined the reproducibility and accuracy of RNA-seq in a multi-site study using different sequencing platforms. The SEQC study found that the correlation of relative gene expression measurements between different RNA-seq platforms (SOLiD, Life Technologies; HiSeq 2000, Illumina) and Affymetrix HuGene U133 Plus 2.0 microarrays with TaqMan qRT-PCR was high (Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients of >0.9), although none of the platforms provided accurate absolute quantification of transcript levels, based on evaluation of ERCC spike-in control titration values 98 . Sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility of differential expression calls across sites were dependent on the analysis pipeline and the use of filters. Applying filters for P value, fold-change and expression level improved the false discovery rate for differential gene expression analysis, with most pipelines showing high reprodu cibility for differential expression calls across sites and greatest concordance for the most highly expressed genes. Consistent with previous reports, the SEQC study found that RNA-seq was seen as fundamentally superior at detecting novel transcripts, such as those resulting from alternative splicing, validating over 80% by qRT-PCR 100 . The ABRF study examined intra-and inter-laboratory reproducibility at 15 different laboratories, comparing different library preparation methods, sample variables (RNA integrity, size-specific fractionation), analysis algorithms and sequencing platforms. The ABRF study reported an overall high concordance for normalized gene expression measures within platforms (Spearman correlation >0.86) and between platforms (Spearman correlation >0.83). Deficiencies in cross-platform detection were identified and associated with read-length, analysis approaches and technology differences 101 . Similar to previous reports, library preparation methods influenced transcript enrichment, with poly(A) libraries containing more exonic reads and ribo-depletion libraries containing more intronic reads. Notably, although differences were observed, differential gene expression results were comparable between poly(A) enrichment and ribo-depletion library preparation methods, as well as between degraded and non-degraded RNA samples 101 .",

By comparison, standards were established early on for DNA-based NGS by the 1,000 Genomes Project, including variant call format (VCF), binary alignment/map format (BAM format) and genotype likelihoods, essentially providing the 'best practice approaches' . Before 2014, reference standards, ERCC spike-in controls and the general MAQC were major contributors towards building a reproducible RNA-seq pipeline, but they pale in comparison to having a consensus germline-genomic reference standard, such as the NA12878 human reference genome 112 . As a consequence of this lack of standards, RNA-seq provided fertile grounds for the emergence of a multitude of software tools and other options, all competing for relevance as part of a broad range of RNA-seq solutions. RNA-seq pipelines represent the laboratory-specific wrapper scripts, chaining together collections of software tools with the goal of reporting hundreds to thousands of test results from gigabases of data. Unfortunately, having RNA-seq pipelines composed of several independently developed components, each with continual versioning and variable licenses, can be challenging in a clinical testing laboratory.

The first are those approved through the CLIA of 1988 that allow 'laboratory-developed tests' (LDTs). LDTs are in vitro diagnostic tests that are developed and used within a single approved laboratory and are not marketed towards any other laboratory. CLIA regulations monitor the laboratory process to ensure the accuracy, reliability and appropriateness of laboratory testing, from sample acquisition, handling and storage to the interpretation and reporting of test results. The guidelines for approving CLIA laboratories are established by accredited professional organizations, such as the College of American Pathologists or by other agencies approved by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), such as in the state of New York. CLIA regulations of LDTs do not address the clinical validity or clinical utility of an assay, but instead provide a framework whereby clinical laboratories validate analytical performance measures of the LDTs within their own laboratory facility. The second set of regulations for clinical assay deployment are the Medical Device Amendments of 1976, which expanded FDA oversight for the marketing of in vitro diagnostic devices (IVDs). FDA premarket review of IVDs assures the assay has established analytical and clinical validity; with the exception of companion diagnostics, the FDA does not typically require demonstration of clinical utility for clearance or approval of IVDs. Demonstration of clinical validity (for LDTs) and clinical utility (for LDTs and IVDs) can follow the initial clearance or approval of a diagnostic test; clinical utility, in particular, requires broader clinical evaluation across multiple sites and/or within clinical trials. For example, the Afirma (Veracyte) microarray-based gene expression classifier for thyroid nodule assessment was launched in 2011 as a CLIA-regulated LDT. Subsequent studies have reported on clinical validity 116 and clinical utility 117 , the latter involving a multi-site study that demonstrated the effects of the Afirma test on clinical care recommendations, which resulted in a reduction of unnecessary surgeries 117 .",

The FDA also provided a perspective on the mammoth shifts created by technological advances associ ated with NGS, and the requirement for the agency to change from the current 'general enforcement discretion' -in which the FDA has generally not enforced regulations with respect to LDTs -to having a more active role, with proposed premarket review and quality system regulation requirements 120 .

Accuracy was evaluated using a representative subset of variants, rather than evaluating all possible variants, and relied on publicly available data to support clinical relevance of the variants. Although evaluation of analytical performance may continue to involve this subset-based approach, the proposed new standards, as outlined by the FDA 120 , could include defined technical metrics for data quality, additional standards for computational approaches and standard best practices for quality assurance. The debate over FDA oversight is largely focused on the presence or absence detection of DNA variants, such as germline cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) or BRCA2 testing. While the FDA guidance and debate is limited in use of examples, the broad scope of additional regulation on all NGS-developed tests, including RNA-seq, may provide regulatory uncertainty for RNA-seq and impede its adoption in the clinic. The proposed FDA regulations around NGS have not gone without debate, emphasizing that the limited enforcement capabilities and regulatory guidance could unnecessarily stifle adoption and innovation 121 . International regulatory frameworks vary across jurisdictions 122, 123 , with evolving practice guidelines and regulations for the clinical use of NGS 118, 119, 123, 124 . For example, in the European Union (EU), IVD tests require a Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE) mark to indicate compliance with the EU IVD Directive (98/79/EC).

The application of these integrative sequencing strategies resulted in changes to patient management in 46% (42 out of 91) of cases, changes to therapy in 15% (14 out of 91) and partial or complete clinical remissions in 10% (9 out of 91), including cases in which potentially actionable events (mainly gene fusions) were detected by RNA-seq, but absent in DNA sequencing 139 .

Using RNA-seq and whole-genome sequencing, Andersson and colleagues 127 reported fusion detection in infant mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL)-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. In addition, they identified frequent activating mutations in tyrosine kinase-PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase)-RAS signalling pathway genes, at low DNA allele frequencies, which is suggestive of clonal populations; however, RNA-seq data demonstrated expression of the mutant allele in all cases 127 .",

Integrated analysis of DNA sequencing and RNA-seq data in triple-negative breast cancer samples also revealed the consequence of a splice site alteration in the tumour suppressor retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), providing transcript evidence for an in-frame exon skipping event that was suggested to result in RB1 inactivation, indicating a lack of benefit from CDK4/CDK6 inhibitors 141 . In another study 142 , integrated whole-genome and whole-transcriptome analysis of cholangiocarcinoma tumours revealed fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusions in three of six cases, two of which received FGFR-targeted therapy with evidence of clinical response. In an additional case, preferential allele-specific expression of a loss-of-function mutation in ERBB receptor feedback inhibitor 1 (ERRFI1), a negative regulator of EGFR, was detected and the patient went on to experience marked disease regression following treatment with an EGFR inhibitor 142 . Together, these selected oncology examples illustrate the potential clinical value for integrating DNA-and RNA-based measures.",

Before initial clinical introduction, a clinical test must demonstrate analytical validity, showing sufficient assay performance to produce accurate and reproducible technical results. Demonstration of analytical validity involves several measures, including sensitivity (true technical positives), specificity (true technical negatives), robustness and limits of detection. Clinical validity follows analytical validity and, depending on the approval path, demonstration of clinical validity can come before (US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in vitro diagnostic device) or after (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) laboratory-developed test) test clearance or approval. Clinical validity refers to the concordance between the test result and the clinical diagnosis or outcome and involves measures of sensitivity (true clinical positives) and specificity (true clinical negatives), as well as determination of positive and negative predictive values. Demonstration of both analytical validity and clinical validity occurs before that of clinical utility. Clinical utility requires clinical evidence that use of the test has an impact on patient care and includes evaluation of patient outcomes and the economic benefits associated with the test.
