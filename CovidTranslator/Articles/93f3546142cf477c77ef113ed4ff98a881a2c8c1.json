            "text": "Old mice will have a subset of lesions as part of the progressive decline in organ function that defines aging. External and palpable lesions will be noted by the research, husbandry, or veterinary staff during testing, cage changing, or physical exams. While these readily observable lesions may cause alarm, not all cause undue distress or are life-threatening. In aging research, mice are maintained until near end of life that, depending on strain and genetic manipulation, can be upwards of 33 months. Aging research has unique welfare issues related to age-related decline, debilitation, fragility, and associated pain of chronic diseases. An effective aging research program includes the collaboration and education of the research, husbandry, and veterinary staff, and of the members of the institution animal care and use committee. This collaborative effort is critical to humanely maintaining older mice and preventing excessive censorship due to non-lethal diseases. Part of the educational process is becoming familiar with how old mice appear clinically, at necropsy and histopathologically. This baseline knowledge is important in making the determination of humane end points, defining health span, contributing causes of death and effects of interventions. The goal of this paper is to introduce investigators to age-associated diseases and lesion patterns in mice from clinical presentation to pathologic assessment. To do so, we present and illustrate the common clinical appearances, necropsy and histopathological lesions seen in subsets of the aging colonies maintained at the University of Washington.",

            "text": "Defining what constitutes health and therefore health span in mice or humans is not a simple task. Medical experts with years of specialized training in geriatrics and/ or biogerontology cannot completely define human healthy aging. For elderly mice, there is no predefined professional curriculum for specialized training, which is comparable to the human track. The mouse 'geriatricians' and biogerontologists are often a team of research scientists, veterinarians, medical doctors, graduate students, veterinary technicians, and animal husbandry staff with varied educational and cultural backgrounds. To find a working consensus of a 'healthy' old mouse is challenging given the diverse backgrounds of the humans working with the mice. It is not a trivial consideration, either. Decisions on treatments and euthanasia for humane reasons are impacted by people's expectations of what is a healthy mouse. Applying a definition proposed in M. Tatar's report on the Biology of Aging Summit (6) : 'Good health is recognized by the ability to retain or return to normal levels when a subject is manipulated in a way to perturb a targeted system', is one way to define health in a measureable way. However, 'normal levels' must be predefined, ideally, at the level of the cell, tissue, organ, organism, and colony. Individuals or groups working with the aging mouse colonies must have baseline information from which they can determine what is, and is not, 'normal' for the age of the mouse. If an observer has never seen a 30-month-old mouse, and is only familiar with the appearance of younger mice, they may be apt to classify an old mouse as 'sick' when it actually may only be exhibiting the expected age-associated frailty and readily observable but nonlethal lesions.",

In the aging colonies, animals were multiply housed (4\u00c15 per cage, separate sexes) in ventilated cages containing Bed-O-Cob (Andersons, Maumee, OH) in a specific pathogenfree facility at the University of Washington. Mice were fed irradiated Picolab Rodent Diet 20 #5053 (PMI Nutrition International, Brentwood, MO) and provided reverse osmosis water. All supplies entering animal rooms were autoclaved, and rooms were maintained at 70\u00c1748F, 45\u00c155% humidity, with 28 air changes per hour and a 12hour light/dark cycle. Sentinel mice were tested quarterly and were negative for endo-and ectoparasites, mouse hepatitis virus, mouse parvovirus, and rotavirus, and they were tested annually for Mycoplasma pulmonis, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus-3, Sendai virus, and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. The mice from aging colonies mice were not tested for Helicobacter species or mouse Norovirus.

            "text": "Clinical assessments and definitions of sick versus moribund mice Clinical observations in mouse colonies typically begin with superficial assessments by the husbandry staff during change changing. These readily conducted assessments include body condition, pelage condition, and activity levels (15, 16) . A general consensus for normal mouse appearance includes a well-kept coat, bright eyes, erect ears, active and engaged in its environment (17) . If an animal deviates from the observer's definition of normal, it is reported to Veterinary Service Staff through generation of a 'sick animal report'. Veterinary service staff and/or clinicians conduct a thorough physical exam and determine the health status of the mouse. Generally accepted sick rodent signs include hunched posture, unkempt coat, discharge from the eyes or other body orifice, rectal or uterine prolapses, skin lesions, palpable masses, reluctance to move, poor body condition, and/or hydration. The presentation of illness and its severity in a mouse can be varied and therefore descriptive criteria for end points must be established in order to minimize pain and distress and maximize data quality (15) . For aging colonies, the mice are ideally maintained until near end of life (EOL) and will have age-associated diseases that may cause some to consider the old mouse 'sick' (18) . To prevent unwarranted censoring of mice due to nonterminal diseases, consensus descriptive criteria for endof-life and humane euthanasia were developed. Mice were considered to be at EOL and euthanized when they were moribund and demonstrated one or more clinical signs suggestive of imminent death within 24 hours (19) . These signs included (1) non-responsiveness to being touched, (2) cold body temperature to the touch, (3) slow or labored respiration, (4) hunched body position with matted fur, (5) failure to eat and drink (as determined by food hopper weights and degree of dehydration), or (6) poor body condition score or !20% loss of body weight relative to baseline (20) . Mice that were nearing EOL, as determined by less severe clinical signs and up to 20% weight loss, were closely examined twice a day, 7 days a week. Mice that met the above criteria were killed by CO 2 and necropsies performed.",

Hematoxylin and eosin-stained section of mild alopecia with minimal chronic inflammation within the dermis (arrow). Note thickness of the subcutis (SC). Follicles are sparse and devoid of hair shafts. F. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained section of severe proliferative dermatitis (pseudoepitheliomatous). The epidermis is markedly thickened with irregular rete peg formation in this somewhat tangentially oriented section. Dyskeratosis and mild orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis are also present with moderate chronic dermatitis that extends into the SC. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia is frequently seen histologically at the thickened edges of chronic ulcerative foci (see 2D). comprehensive review of gender-specific lesion spectrums in a number of inbred strains, including UW aged C57BL6, will be published elsewhere. Compete blood counts with differentials and clinical chemistry panels for two of the mice are presented in Table 3 .",

            "text": "Aging mice housed at the UW have four common clinical presentations, which are readily observable at the cage level and thus are frequently reported. These include rectal prolapse, alopecia and dermatitis, ocular lesions, and palpable masses. Whereas mice are reported and sometimes euthanized due to one of the above disease processes, there are often unsuspected comorbidities that may be more severe than the initial presenting clinical diagnosis. Many pathophysiological processes associated with aging, such as tissue atrophy, chronic inflammation, dysplasia, and occult neoplasia may not result in robust clinical signs (18) . Additionally, moribund animals may be euthanized due to relatively non-specific signs such as hunched, cold to the touch with loss of body condition, and increased respiratory effort. The morbid state is often a result of the combination of diseases, especially in older mice (21, 23) . To characterize the full spectrum of lesions present at the EOL, and the definitive diagnosis of diseases, necropsies and histological examinations are required. Whereas clinical pathology including complete blood counts with differentials and chemistry panels are widely used antemortem diagnostic tests in most species, the limited amount of blood that can be humanely obtained from live mice restricts the number of tests that can be performed with any one sample. However, terminal blood collection usually provides an adequate volume for full panels. Table 3 provides clinical pathology data and histopathological diagnoses for two of the mice illustrated in this manuscript. In the mice presented here, renal, vascular, inflammatory, and degenerative diseases were the common lesions diagnosed by histology. In the following section, the common age-associated diseases and lesions in the C57BL/6J colony at the UW are reviewed and illustrated.",

            "text": "The mouse rectum, in contrast to the human, is extremely short and is susceptible to prolapse. Rectal prolapse ( Fig.  1 ) in mice may be caused by inflammation in the colon due to infectious agents, such as pinworms or Helicobacter species (Fig. 1C\u00c1F) , with increased abdominal pressure caused by pregnancy, masses, stranguria, or diarrhea. With age, it is plausible that the pelvic musculature may weaken allowing for prolapses to occur more readily \u00c1 although this has not been investigated extensively (24) . In many cases, the definitive cause for rectal prolapse is not determined; however, known causes may be excluded. In the UW aging colonies, pinworms and Citrobacter rodentium have not been diagnosed. The colonies are not tested for Helicobacter species, which can cause colitis and rectal prolapse in certain susceptible GEMs such as the 129-Smad3 tm/Par /J model of bacterialdriven colon cancer (14) . In immune competent mice, such as B6, Helicobacter species are considered commensal and should not cause disease. Rectal prolapses vary in clinical appearance (Fig. 1B\u00c1D ) and, in female mice, must be distinguished from uterine or vaginal prolapse. Mild prolapse is a protrusion of the rectum extending only 1\u00c12 mm from the base of the tail and perineum and the prolapsed mucosa is light pink and moist, with little adherent material (Fig. 1B) . Mild prolapse often cause little detriment to the animal, which can survive and thrive with these lesions for some time. Severe rectal prolapse is a protrusion of both distal colon (DC) and rectal mucosa extending !3 mm from the base of the tail and perineum (Fig. 1C,D) . The severely prolapsed mucosa is often reddened and edematous to necrotic with adhered fecal or bedding material (Fig. 1C) . Often, feces inside the cage will be sticky, an indication of diarrhea. In long-standing cases, the mucosa may become proliferative (Fig. 1D) . Exposure of the delicate colorectal mucosa to the cage environment provides a nidus of chronic inflammation and entry of bacteria in the systemic circulation. There is no completely effective treatment for rectal prolapse. Clinical recommendations for mice with rectal prolapses vary between facilities and experimental protocols; in general, mild rectal prolapses with no other clinical signs of systemic illness are often monitored, while euthanasia is recommended for mice with moderate to severe rectal prolapses. Histologically, the prolapsed mucosa may be ulcerated to necrotic or, with chronicity, proliferative with squamous metaplasia (Fig. 1E,F) . Adherent bacterial colonies, plant material and fecal matter may also be present. In typical cases, the underlying vasculature and submucosa (SM) is edematous and inflamed and may be congested. Inflammation may be acute, primarily neutrophilic when there are ulcers and bacteria, or lympho- Fig. 3 . Clinical and histological presentations of common eye lesions. A. Normal periocular shape, eye size, and color in a 24-monthold CB6F1 mouse included here for contrast to the mouse in 3B. Note the lack of pelage and vibrissae due to extensive barbering by cage mates. Barbering is another relatively common skin presentation. It may lead to dermatitis in the victim and impaction of hair fragments into gingival sulcus of the barber. B. A 24-month-old CB6F1 mouse has periocular and retrobulbar swelling (between arrows) with bulopthalmia. This presentation may be a result of periocular cellulitis, conjunctivitis, or retrobulbar mass such as an abscesses or neoplasia. In this mouse, the swelling was due to a large retrobulbar mass (4C), which was diagnosed histologically as a Harderian adenoma (3D) C. Corneal opacity in a 28\u00c1month-old B6 mouse. The small foci (arrow) at the rostal aspect of the cornea is an ulcer, which was confirmed clinically with fluorescein dye test clinically and histologically (3F) D.

The hydrophilic stroma will uptake fluorescein dye when the hydrophobic epithelial layer is breeched. Note the dense inflammatory infiltrate and neovascularization in the stroma. These also contribute to the corneal opacity noted clinically (3C). histiocytic when chronic. Chronic prolapse can lead to severe mucosal hyperplasia with subsequent mucosal herniation due to the thin SM. The herniated glands must be differentiated from invasive carcinoma (25) .",

            "text": "Barbering, alopecia, dermatitis, and scarring are commonly seen in mice (Fig. 2) . Dermatitis may have a variety of causes including infectious agents, such as fur mites, or fighting with secondary bacterial infections. These will often respond to treatments such as removal of aggressive mice, topic and oral antibiotic, or corticosteroids (26) . In contrast, idiopathic ulcerative dermatitis in the B6 mouse does not respond to treatment. Affected B6 mice are usually pruritic leading to self-mutilation, disease progression and, often, euthanasia for humane reasons. The B6 chronic ulcerative dermatitis has been attributed to many causes (27, 28) most recently primary follicular dystrophy (29) . The clinical disease is variable, waxes and wanes, appears to have sex, and season predilections. As seen with other strain-specific diseases, the use of F1 hybrids has a decreased incidence of B6 dermatitis (1, 30); however, skin lesions remain a significant background factor in aging colonies (29) . Collectively, skin lesions in aging mouse colonies have variable presentations ranging from the very mild alopecia to severe ulcerative disease requiring euthanasia. Mild changes, such as ill-kept fur (Fig. 2B ) are often one of the first clinical signs noted in diseased mice. It is nonspecific and a result of decreased grooming. Alopecia in mice may present on the head ( Fig. 2A) or in a patches (Fig. 2C) . Barbering by cage mates may result in areas of hair loss; however, distinctive patterns (Fig. 3A) and the presence of one unaffected (dominant) mouse in the cage will help to rule out dermatitis. Histologically, dermatitis is also variable in presentation and severity, depending on etiology and chronicity. Mild lesions (Fig. 2E) with few scattered inflammatory cells may be noted in regions of clinical alopecia. Severe lesions may occur and are often a combination of ulceration, necrosis, and associated chronic-active inflammation. Healing is by dermal fibrosis and marked epithelial hyperplasia (Fig. 2F) . Like rectal prolapses, open skin lesions serve as a nidus for bacterial infection with skin commensals (Staphylococcal species) and result in smoldering inflammation that may affect physiological parameters such as inflammatory cytokines, leukograms, lymphadenopathy, and reactive amyloidosis (31) .",

Skin commensals may also contribute to keratitis, conjunctivitis, and blepharitis. With age, atrophy and chronic inflammation of the lacrimal glands is very common and may result in decreased tear production and secondary corneal lesions (keratoconjucntivits sicca). Regardless of the cause, cornea lesions present as opaque eyes with variable amount of discharge. In pigmented strains, corneal opacity is particularly easy to recognize due to the contrast with the dark globe (Fig. 3C) . Ulcerative keratitis may be diagnosed clinically via ophthalmic exams and fluorescein stain uptake into the ulcerated cornea. Treatment options may include antibiotics and or steroids and will vary by facility and experimental protocol. Frequently in aged mice, the bulk of the ulceration and active inflammation is resolved; histologically, the chronic corneal lesion is characterized by proliferation of the corneal epithelium with varying neovascularization and chronic inflammation (Fig. 3E,F) . Other eye lesions commonly reported include proptosis with or without bulopthalmia secondary to retrobulbar abscesses, Harderian gland, or intraorbital gland neoplasias (Fig. 3B,D) . Cataracts are also quite common in aged mice but are more challenging to diagnose clinically usually requiring slit lamp examination (32, 33) antemortem or postmortem histopathological assessment.",

In the UW aging colonies, enlarged and occasionally infected seminal vesicles in male mice were reported Fig. 4 . External and internal masses may be due to degenerative, inflammatory, or neoplastic lesions. A. Swelling in the lower right abdomen and the inguinal region (between arrows) are present in this 24-month-old male CB6F1. The inguinal swelling is due to an infected preputial gland. The abdominal swelling is due to enlarged, but otherwise normal, seminal vesicles (see also D). B. A 27-monthold male CB6F1 with bilateral abdominal swelling (arrows) from severe unilateral hydronephrosis and enlarged and infected seminal vesicles (see also E). C. A large multilobulated retro-orbital mass causing proptosis of the eye (between arrows). The cornea is cloudy due to keratitis (see also Fig. 3B,D) . D. Internal examination of the mouse in A demonstrates bilaterally enlarged seminal vesicles, a common finding in older male mice. The seminal vesicular fluid is normally white and will discolor with infection or infarction (compare to E). Additional gross lesions are an enlarged heart with mild hepatomegaly, pneumonopathy, and the preputial abscessation (*) noted in A (between arrows). E. The internal examination of the mouse in B demonstrates severe unilateral hydronephrosis (K) and enlarged and infected seminal vesicle (V). The kidney is filled with dark brown colored fluid, a severe sequelae of obstructive uropathy (mouse urologic syndrome). Other lesions include absence of body fat, enlarged and cystic preputial glands (arrow), enlarged heart and pulmonary atelectasis (*), and light yellow firm foci (arrowhead) diagnosed histologically as AMP (see Fig. 6K ,L). F. A 29-month-old male CB6F1 with bilateral cystic preputial glands (arrow), scant body fat (body condition score of 2/5), and tacky appearing tissues (mild to moderate dehydration). G. Multiple pulmonary neoplastic foci in a 30-month-old female CB6F1 mouse. This unusual presentation is more consistent with metastatic rather than primary disease. Histopathological diagnosis, however, confirmed mucinous pulmonary adenocarcinoma (see inset Fig. 5B ). H. Typical presentation of a CB6F1 pulmonary adenocarcinoma from 28 to 30-monthold mice. Grossly, one large white firm mass extends from the right lung. Microscopically, there may be multiple foci of neoplasia. Cranioventral atelectasis and consolidation of the lungs is also present (arrows). I. A large mesenteric mass in the region of a cluster of lymph nodes (bracketed by arrows) from a 28-month-old B6 mouse. Differentials include lymphoma and histiocytic sarcoma. Hepatic involvement with the neoplastic process is suggested by the roughened appearance of the liver (compare to D and E) and was confirmed histologically. initially as abdominal tumors (Fig. 4A,B) . In older B6 male mice, progressive enlargement of the seminal vesicles is extremely common (34) and our experience suggests that it is also common in CB6F1 hybrids.",

The subcutaneous lymph nodes, especially the submandibular, may be enlarged due to physiologic lymphoid reactive hyperplasia secondary to systemic or localized inflammation. Systemic lymphadenopathy involving subcutaneous and internal lymph nodes is most frequently due to malignant lymphoma. Other subcutaneous structures such as the mammary fat pads or salivary glands may also become inflamed or neoplastic and present as palpable masses. Often, the masses can be diagnosed as inflammatory or neoplastic at necropsy with the combination of the gross presentation and cytology. However, histopathology is definitive as neoplasia may also be infected or inflamed. For example, the retro-orbital mass in Fig. 4C was suspected clinically, and at necropsy, to be a chronic retrobulbar abscess. Final histopathological diagnosis was a Harderian gland adenoma (Fig. 3D) . For malignancies within the lung, determining whether neoplastic masses are primary lung tumors versus metastatic disease may be challenging without the aid of histology (Fig. 4G,H) . Inbred strains vary in their typical spectrum of disease and neoplasia is no exception (9, 35, 36) . In the B6 background, hematopoietic neoplasias (malignant lymphoma and histiocytic sarcoma) are extremely common (Table 1) (21, 36, 37) . Necropsy findings for these hematopoietic neoplasias often overlap, for example, enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes (Fig. 4I) can be affected by either type. While there are differences in organ distribution and cellular morphology (Fig. 5I\u00c1L ) that allow distinction between the malignant lymphomas and histiocytic sarcoma, definitive diagnosis may require immunohistochemical or molecular analysis (38\u00c140).",

Kidneys with chronic nephropathy and or glomerular amyloid (if severe) appear pale and pitted and the size may be altered. Cysts, infarcts, and hydronephrosis all may impact kidney size and shape. Obstructive uropathy is common in male mice and is due to blockage of the lower urinary tract from multiple causes (44) . Retention of urine may result in or from inflammation of the urogenital tract or accessory sex glands and pressure may cause hydronephrosis (Fig. 4E) . Histologically, chronic nephropathy is characterized by early tubular lesions and progresses to include glomerular changes and interstitial inflammation (Fig. 6C,D) . There is a large reserve capacity of the kidney to maintain function even in the face of nephron loss thus, for nephropathy alone to cause significant morbidity, it would have to be moderate to severe or accompanied by other lesions affecting the kidney such as hydronephrosis or neoplasia. However, subclinical or mild nephropathy with associated diminished renal reserve would increase susceptibility to additional insults and homeostatic imbalance (45) . Glo-merular amyloidosis and membranous glomerulonephropathy may appear histologically similar and can be differentiated by use of Congo Red for amyloid and PAS for increased mesangial matrix (31) . Arteritis Segmental arteritis with variable components including fibrinoid necrosis, smooth muscle proliferation, and mixed inflammation occurs in small to medium arteries of various organs (Fig. 6I,J) (31) . Commonly affected tissues in these studies included the mesentery, tongue heart, reproductive tracts, and kidney. An immune mediate pathogenesis has been proposed (27, 46) . In humans with a similar disease processes, polyarteritis nodosa, clinical signs are related to affected organ dysfunction (47) . In mice, the most overt clinical sign associated with arteritis is vestibular syndrome (head tilts and/or circling) as describe above (31) .",

Findings include reactive lymphoid hyperplasia in spleen and lymph nodes, increased lymphoid aggregates in various organs, expansion of mesenteric/omental milk spots, acidophilic macrophage pneumonia (AMP), reactive amyloidosis, and the renal lesions discussed above. Omental milky spots (50), mesenteric aggregates with mixed lymphocytes, histiocytes, and plasma cells are frequently reactive in older mice with germinal centers and occasional Mott cells (Fig. 6A,B) . Similar reactive changes can be present in lymphoid aggregates found in various tissues including the renal pelvis, bladder, lungs, and liver. Reactive lymph nodes may present clinically as a lymphadenopathy with histological sinusoidal histiocytosis, mastocytosis, or plasmacytosis with germinal centers, which aid in differentiating hyperplasia from neoplasia. AMP is a common idiopathic disease in mice, especially of those on B6 and 129Sv background (51, 52) . Although definitively diagnosed with histopathology, severe AMP may be noticed at necropsy as foci of firm, pale tan to cream areas in the lungs, which fail to collapse. The AMP is often associated with pulmonary neoplasia (Fig. 5A,B) or chronic pneumonia (Fig. 6K,L) (31, 53) . The characteristic histopathologic lesion is accumulations of large macrophages with abundant cytoplasm containing variable numbers of bright eosinophilic crystals. Multinucleated giant cells, epithelial hyalinosis, and extracellular acicular crystals may also be present (51) .",

We and others (54) have noted dysplastic intrapulpal denticles in the incisors of older mice (Fig. 7A,B) . These lesions may result in abnormal wear and or breakage of the incisors that contribute to periodontitis and decreased ability to effectively gnaw rodent chow. We have noted, in two of three cases of intrapulpal denticles, an association with moderate to severe temporomandibular osteoarthritis (Fig. 7C,D) . The precise relationship between the development of these two lesions is unknown \u00c1 whether the abnormal tooth development aggravated the joint disease or vice versa. It is plausible that the combination of the lesions results in painful and ineffective mastication. Osteoarthritis of the knee, hip, elbow, and vertebra would result in abnormal gaits and, if severe, clinically recognizable joint swelling due ossification of the joint capsule and periarticular fibrosis (55) . Preliminary necropsy results from the current health span study in CB6F1 suggest the incidence of clinical osteoarthritis may be relatively high (personal observation CPB). Other preliminary observations from necropsies in the on-going health span study include high incidence of skin, male reproductive tract, renal lesions, and hepatosplenomegaly that likely is due to hematopoietic neoplasia.

Intensive monitoring of aged mice is needed to prevent undue suffering and loss of valuable data when mice are found dead (18, 19) . On the other hand, excessive censoring of mice due to easily observable external non-lethal lesions can impact aging studies (21) . A balance is needed and can be achieved via education about the unique appearances and humane care issues associated with geriatric mice (19, 56, 57) . Here we have illustrated some of the common clinical, necropsy, and histologic lesions in aged mice to provide a basic introduction into the variety and complexity of age-associated diseases in mice. Necropsy and histopathologic assessments of aged mice coupled with antemortem physiologic testing allows for full characterization of disease onset and patterns, thereby defining frailty and decline in function in aging mouse models. Validation of these models so that they may be better translated to human aging interventions is the goal for the entire biogerontology community of geriatricians, gerontologists, basic scientists, medical and veterinary scientists, and pathologists (5, 6).
