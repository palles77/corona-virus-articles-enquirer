Using the ferret model, we trace the evolutionary pathway by which an avian-like virus evolves the capacity for mammalian replication and airborne transmission. During initial infection, within-host HA diversity increased drastically. Then, airborne transmission fixed two polymerase mutations that do not confer a detectable replication advantage. In later transmissions, selection fixed advantageous HA1 variants. Transmission initially involved a ''loose'' bottleneck, which became strongly selective after additional HA mutations emerged. The stringency and evolutionary forces governing between-host bottlenecks may therefore change throughout host adaptation. Mutations occurred in multiple combinations in transmitted viruses, suggesting that mammalian transmissibility can evolve through multiple genetic pathways despite phenotypic constraints. Our data provide a glimpse into avian influenza virus adaptation in mammals, with broad implications for surveillance on potentially zoonotic viruses.",

Introducing the mammal-adapting substitution PB2 E627K enhanced replication (Figures S1A, S1B, and S1E), but not transmission. To assess the impact of known mammalian-adapting mutations in HA on transmission of this virus, HA E190D and G225D (H3, mature peptide numbering) were introduced into the 1918-like avian/ PB2 E627K virus, generating what we will term the ''avian-like'' ''HA190D225D'' virus. Deep sequencing showed that both HA E190D and G225D arose naturally before being introduced: each was detectable in one animal 5 days after inoculation with the 1918-like avian virus ( Figures 1A and 1B) . HA E190D became dominant in all three animals inoculated with the 1918-like avian/PB2 E627K virus ( Figure 1C ). The HA190D225D virus was transmitted in 1 of 3 ferret pairs (Figures S1C and S1F). To characterize mutations occurring in HA190D225D, we analyzed RNA isolated from stock viruses and from nasal secretions from all three index animals and the infected contact. We included stock viruses in this analysis both to define ''input'' viral populations and because even viruses created by reverse ge-netics can accumulate mutations during passage in culture. We enumerated all SNPs occurring at R1% frequency in each virus sequenced; we previously established that this conservative cutoff ensures that only bona fide mutations are considered (Wilker et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Sequencing revealed that two additional HA mutations arose and were transmitted. HA G400A, encoding serine-to-asparagine at amino acid 113 (S113N), was present in 3% of viruses in the HA190D225D stock and rose to 46%-75% in all three index animals by 3 days post-inoculation, declining on day 5 (Figure 1D , solid traces). S113N was detected in 63% of viruses in the contact soon after transmission ( Figure 1D , broken trace). The second mutation, HA A868T, encoded aspartate-to-valine at position 265 (D265V). D265V was not detectable in the virus stock above 1% but increased in frequency in all three index animals and was present in 40% of viruses transmitted to the contact ( Figure 1E ). Both S113N and D265V are located near the base of the HA globular head ( Figure 1F ). Cloning and sequencing of full-length HA from day 5 showed that S113N and D265V were linked in a small fraction of viruses (2/20 [10%] clones in index and 1/32 [3.125%] in contact; Figures  S2A and S2B ). Viruses were next isolated from the contact animal's nasal wash at day 9 post-contact and amplified on MDCK cells to produce the ''Mut'' stock virus, which was used to inoculate another three ferret pairs (Watanabe et al., 2014) . The Mut virus exhibited similar replication kinetics and pathogenicity to human-derived 1918 viruses and was transmitted in 2/3 pairs (Figures S1D and S1F) (Watanabe et al., 2014) . HA S113N and D265V were maintained at frequencies comparable to those in the inoculum (Figures 1G and 1H, solid traces) . Another novel HA mutation, HA T634C, arose, encoding isoleucine-to-threonine at position 187 (I187T) near the receptor-binding pocket ( Figure 1F ). Present at 4% in the Mut stock virus, I187T rose to 32%-41% in all three index animals by day 5 post-inoculation and was fixed after transmission in contact animal 1 ( Figure 1I ). I187T was not transmitted to contact animal 3 but arose on day 9 post-contact. The rapid increase of I187T in all index animals and its independent re-generation in contact animal 3 strongly suggest that this mutation is advantageous. Indeed, all 17 publicly available human 1918 sequences have 187T, as do 310/338 full-length avian H1N1 HAs (Reid et al., 1999 (Reid et al., , 2003 Sheng et al., 2011; Taubenberger et al., 1997) . S113N, D265V, and I187T were not all transmitted together. S113N was fixed in contact animal 3 after transmission, while D265V and I187T were undetectable (Figures 1G-1I, light blue broken traces). By contrast, D265V and I187T were fixed after transmission in contact animal 1, and S113N was undetectable ( Figures 1G-1I , dark blue broken traces). Cloning and Sanger sequencing showed that S113N and D265V were linked at % 33% frequency in Mut index animals 1 and 3 (Figures S3C and S3D); we cannot determine from these data why S113N and D265V were not transmitted together. Our results suggest that in this genetic context, HA 190D and 225D may benefit transmission, but multiple other SNPs may also bestow increased transmission efficiency.",

Introducing HA190D and 225D into the 1918-like avian virus in the laboratory likely affected the evolutionary pathway these viruses followed, and we cannot know how evolution would have proceeded in their absence. Once introduced, HA 225D remained at or near fixation in all HA190D225D-infected animals ( Figure S3A ). Although G225D was present in 97% of the Mut stock virus, its frequency decreased to 72%-87% by day 5 post-inoculation in all three index animals ( Figure 1J , solid traces). Sequencing at day 5 revealed glycine at position 225 (225G) in 9%-15% of viruses . Also, an asparagine (225N) was now encoded by 8%-13% of viruses in index animals 1 and 3 (Figures S3B-S3D). HA 225D was fixed after transmission in both contacts, but its frequency declined to 93% in contact 3 by day 9 (Figure 1J) . Indeed, by day 5 viruses encoded a mixture of 225D/ 225N in contact 1 and 225D/225N/225G in contact 3 ( Figures  S3B and S3C ). Thus, G225D may be favored during transmission between hosts, but polymorphism at 225 seems to be tolerated within a host.",

Various anatomical sites and cell types may exert differing degrees of selective pressure favoring a-2,3or a-2,6-tropic viruses (Lakdawala et al., 2015) . HA 225N was identified in severe human infections during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (Kong et al., 2014; Mak et al., 2010; Matos-Patr\u00f3 n et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2013) . It enables binding to both a-2,6 and a-2,3 receptors and increases binding to non-sialylated glycans (Matos-Patr\u00f3 n et al., 2015) . Diversity at position 225 may therefore be maintained due to balancing selection, which preserves multiple beneficial alleles in a population. Alternatively, increasing diversity at site 225 could be due to relaxation of selection, but this hypothesis would not explain the significant increase in nonsynonymous nucleotide diversity we observed in this region, as described below.",

D265V is located proximal to S113N ( Figure 1F ) and may serve a similar function in modulating heat stability. We hypothesize that during the early stages of mammalian adaptation, selective pressures (e.g., diverse receptor profiles, temperatures, and host factors) may promote accumulation and maintenance of a large number of mutations in HA that later can be selected by the new host environment (Lauring et al., 2012; Parrish et al., 2008) .",

Comparing the frequencies of synonymous (silent) and nonsynonymous (amino-acid-changing) polymorphisms, denoted pS and pN, respectively, allows us to evaluate the impact of natural selection. pS > pN indicates that, on average, purifying selection is acting to remove deleterious mutations, while pN > pS indicates that diversifying selection is favoring new mutations. Effectively equal levels of pN and pS suggest that allele frequencies are determined primarily by genetic drift. The influenza genome in index animals infected with the HA190D225D and Mut viruses is generally under purifying selection: pS was significantly greater than pN for almost every viral gene, except for NS2/NEP in the Mut index animals (p < 0.01 or p < 0.001, Tables 1 and S2). Strikingly, the exception to this pattern was the 344-codon HA1 region of HA. pN/ pS ratios for HA1 were >1 at every time point in each index animal (range = 1.128-3.077, Table S2 ), likely primarily due to high-frequency SNPs in codons 113, 187, 225, and 265, although there were also 6-7 nonsynonymous HA1 SNPs present between 1%-13% (Table  S3) . Average HA1 pN/pS > 1 in HA190D225D and Mut index animals when all time points are combined (mean pN/pS = 1.718 and 2.007, respectively; p < 0.001, Table 1 ). These data provide further indication that diversification in HA1 is strongly favored in index animals.",

We use the term ''haplotype'' to denote a set of mutations that co-occur on the same DNA molecule. If a given set of mutations is beneficial, we would expect the frequency of haplotypes containing those variants to increase. To test whether selection favored specific HA haplotypes, we used LinkGE, a computational tool we developed and validated previously (Wilker et al., 2013) , which enumerates combinations of nucleotides at specified sites in deep sequencing data. We assessed all polymorphic sites in HA1 detected more than once, resulting in a final query of 12 sites (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures and Tables S4 and S5) . Haplotype diversity expanded dramatically during viral replication. Two haplotypes were present during initial HA190D225D infection in the index animal, but five were present by day 5 ( Figure 4A ). Similarly, 3-5 HA haplotypes were present in the Mut virus on day 1, rising to 9-10 on day 3, and 12-14 on day 5 (Figures 4B and 4C) . By day 5, no HA haplotype was pre-sent above 30% in index animals. In agreement, Shannon entropy in HA dramatically increased over time in index animals ( Figures 4E and 4F ).",

Transmission of only a few virions would result in a founder effect, with reduced diversity across the entire viral genome; this effect does not necessarily involve natural selection. Selection favoring transmission of specific variants might be observed as a reduction in diversity localized to the selected region or gene segment. Fixation of advantageous alleles by selection and the resulting reduction in linked nucleotide diversity is called a selective sweep (Nielsen, 2005) . Strong selection during transmission could favor the emergence of mammalian-transmissible viruses, while strong founder effects might impose a barrier to host switching. To differentiate among these processes, we calculated pN and pS across the viral genome at time points surrounding transmission. As we cannot know the exact day on which contact animals became infected, we evaluated viruses in the contact animal at the first time point at which virus was detectable and the corresponding time point in the index animal. To ensure that this choice did not significantly impact our results, we also performed these analyses using the index animal day 3 viruses.",

Here we observed two different types of bottlenecks. Much of the genetic variation in HA190D225D was transmitted, and selection continued to favor HA diversification in the contact animal. In contrast, Mut virus transmission involved reductions in genetic diversity that were sharpest in HA1. Patterns of diversity in both Mut pairs suggest that selection for HA1 variants occurred during transmission; the genome-wide reduction in diversity in Mut pair 3 may be a consequence of the combined action of selection on HA1 and a smaller infecting dose than in pair 1. Importantly, the data we observe in the Mut pairs cannot be explained by a founder effect. The increase or maintenance of diversity across the rest of the genome strongly suggests that multiple virions were transmitted, each of which harbored a single HA haplotype packaged with different variants of the other 7 gene segments. Our data therefore indicate that Mut virus transmission involved a selective sweep acting on HA1. We postulate that founder effects could have occurred in this study but that selection for HA1 variants had a greater impact on genetic diversity.",

We have shown that selection reduces HA nucleotide diversity during H5N1 reassortant virus transmission in ferrets (Wilker et al., 2013) , similar to what we observe during transmission of the Mut virus. Although the H5N1 viruses we studied previously had an avian HA, the rest of their genome was derived from a 2009 H1N1 human pandemic isolate, limiting our ability to assess selection acting outside of HA. The present work afforded the opportunity to characterize selection across the entire avian-like influenza genome. An important caveat is that three amino acid substitutions were artificially introduced into the transmissible HA190225D virus. Although both HA E190D and G225D arose naturally before their introduction, PB2 E627K did not, and it is unknown whether these mutations would have become fixed had evolution proceeded organically. The timing of mutation emergence, the identity of adaptive substitutions, and the number of rounds of replication required may have been different if the evolutionary pathway of this particular virus had been completely unaltered. Despite these caveats, we find that selection is primarily confined to HA1, where diversification is strongest at a few sites encoding amino acids in the globular head (113 and 265) and near the sialic acid binding pocket (187, 190, and 225) .",

PB2 A684D was first detectable immediately after transmission ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that it arose de novo in the contact animal. PA V253M, present in only 9% of viruses in the index animal on day 5, was at 73% in the contact immediately after transmission (Figure 2A) . We cannot conclusively determine whether PA V253M was transmitted as a minor variant or arose de novo afterward. What is clear is that these two polymerase mutations drastically changed in frequency during the first transmission event and became fixed for the rest of the study, even though previous functional analyses suggested that these substitutions reduce the processivity of the 1918-like avian polymerase (without PB2 E627K) in vitro (Watanabe et al., 2014) . In the presence of PB2 E627K, these mutations did not alter polymerase activity, suggesting that PB2 E627K was the primary deter-minant of improved viral replication. Viruses reached similar titer in vivo whether PB2 A684D and PA V253M were at low frequency (HA190D225D index animals) or nearly fixed (Mut index animals; Figure S1E ). These mutations could confer an advantage that we did not directly test (e.g., RNA stability, RNA folding, codon bias). Given our phenotypic data and the known potential for bottlenecks to alter diversity in populations without selection (Hamilton et al., 2012; Varble et al., 2014) , perhaps these mutations hitchhiked to high frequency during transmission. These data underscore that fixation of nonsynonymous variants after transmission is not in itself evidence that they are advantageous and agree with a recent study showing that tight bottlenecks during H7N9 virus transmission allowed deleterious variants to remain at high frequency (Zaraket et al., 2015) . Together, our data suggest that for an avian virus to cross species barriers, overcoming the stochastic fluctuation of mutations during transmission bottlenecks may be just as essential as generating a constellation of mammalian-adapting mutations. Fixation or maintenance of non-or maladaptive mutations during airborne transmission may be a previously unappreciated barrier to influenza crossspecies transmission.",

For any virus lineage, evolving human transmissibility may not require convergence on one specific set of amino acid substitutions.

Synthesizing our data and previous studies, we offer the following conceptual framework to explain our observations, acknowledging that expanded studies are necessary to confirm its broader application. We propose that the stringency of transmission bottlenecks and the main evolutionary forces driving them may change throughout the host adaptation process. We speculate that at earlier stages of host adaptation, there may not be one ''most fit'' virus that is able to outcompete the rest of the population after transmission to localized regions of the respiratory tract (Karlsson et al., 2015; Lakdawala et al., 2015; Matrosovich et al., 2004) . A non-mutually exclusive hypothesis is that a larger inoculum may be required to found infection in the absence of a single highly fit variant. These hypotheses could explain the surprising finding that the first transmission bottleneck was loose, even though relatively few ''avian-like'' viruses would be expected to be fit for transmission in mammals. Indeed, we speculate that viruses that are well adapted for transmission in a particular host species would again exhibit loose transmission bottlenecks, as most variants would be of similar transmission fitness; the recent observation of loose genetic bottlenecks in transmission of seasonal influenza viruses among human household contacts supports this hypothesis (Poon et al., 2016) .",

A tight bottleneck could result from numerous mechanisms, including a small founding population or the ability of a particularly fit variant to outcompete other transmitted virions very early after infection. Initial localized infection by one or a few variants in the contact animal (Karlsson et al., 2015) could also allow for the early dominance of a particular HA variant that then spreads through the upper respiratory tract. Airborne transmission involves numerous steps that impact the makeup of the viral population in the contact: to found infection, virions expelled by the source host must remain viable in a droplet, be inhaled in the contact, and then successfully replicate. Selection could act on any or all of these stages to influence the bottleneck we observe. Should these hypotheses be supported by future investigations, then defining within-host selection and transmission bottlenecks occurring in a spillover infection could be a way to assess the pandemic potential of emerging viruses: tight bottlenecks that include mammal-adapting variants would be expected to characterize viruses undergoing a transition to efficient transmissibility. It is also plausible that the size and stringency of influenza transmission bottlenecks vary widely due to chance alone, rather than progressive host adaptation. Multiple productive exposures, different routes of transmission, and/or differing infectious doses could have this effect without involving selection. We find this scenario less likely for our data given the signatures of selection in both contact animals in the second transmission event, but it too remains a possibility that merits further exploration.",
