Among various antivirals, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are considered important passive therapeutics having an immediate effect against viral pathogens. Here we report a pseudovirus neutralization assay for rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs targeting hemagglutinin (HA) of H5N1 and H1N1 IAV. In this study, we generated six pseudoviruses with an HIV-1 backbone, respectively, expressing HA of four clades of H5N1 IAV and the 2009 epidemic H1N1 IAV. The resulting pseudoviruses were able to infect a variety of human and non-human cells, with 293T cells from human kidney as the most susceptible target cells. Using the established pseudovirus neutralization assay, we showed that three of ten selected mAbs specific to HA could potently neutralize infection of a pseudovirus bearing HA from the homologous IAV A/VietNam/1194/ 2004(H5N1) strain. This was highly consistent with the result of a microneutralization assay testing the same strain of a live IAV. Since the pseudovirus neutralization assay does not involve an infectious virus and can be performed without the requirement of a biosafety-3 laboratory, it may be applied for safe and rapid screening of neutralizing mAbs and antiviral agents targeting HA of IAVs.",

Here we report the development of a safe and convenient neutralization assay for rapid screening neutralizing mAbs targeting HA of H5N1 and H1N1 IAV. We first generated a series of pseudoviruses bearing HAs of four clades of H5N1 IAV isolated from avians and humans, respectively, and the 2009 epidemic H1N1 IAV, and an HIV-1 backbone (pNL4-3.luc.RE). These pseudoviruses are single-cycle and replication-deficient viruses [18] [19] [20] . Then we used these pseudoviruses to establish a neutralizing assay in a BSL-2 laboratory, based on which we screened a panel of mAbs specific for the HA of an H5N1 virus and successfully identified three specific neutralizing mAbs, suggesting that this established assay is safe and efficient for screening neutralizing mAbs targeting HA of IAVs.

The constructed recombinant plasmids containing HA were, respectively, designated as QH-HA-, XJ-HA-, AH-HA-, HK97-HA-, 1194-HA-and H1N1-HA-pcDNA3.1 and confirmed for correct insertion by sequencing analysis.",

Cells were changed into fresh DMEM 8 h later, and exogenous bacterial neuraminidase (NA) from Vibrio cholerae (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added at the concentration of 4.8 lg/ml 24 and 48 h post-transfection. The transfection without adding NA was used as parallel controls. Supernatants containing HA pseudovirus with or without NA were harvested 72 h post-transfection, and used for single-cycle infection. The viral particles with corresponding HA were named as QH-HA, XJ-HA, AH-HA, HK-HA, 1194-HA, and H1N1-HA pseudoviruses, respectively ( Table 1 ). The plasmids encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G), VSV-G-pcDNA3.1, and the pcDNA3.1 vector only were used to co-transfect with pNL4-3.luc.RE plasmid to generate VSV-G pseudovirus and pseudovirus without Env (Env\u00c0) as controls. For titration of the pseudovirus, 293T cells were infected with 100 ll of each pseudovirus at 2-fold dilution in 96-well culture plates, followed by detection of luciferase activity 72 h later.

Although packaged HA pseudoviruses without NA may infect target cells, the addition of exogenous NA to 293T cells co-transfected by HIV-1 (pNL4-3.luc.RE) and HA plasmid was shown to significantly increase the transduction efficiency ( Fig. 2A) , possibly because NA protein may help to remove sialic acid from the host cells to facilitate viral release [25] , thus making it an indispensable component of HA-based IAV infection. These results are consistent with previous reports by Rong and colleagues [21] . The produced HA pseudoviruses were demonstrated to infect a number of nonhuman (MDCK, Vero and CHO-K1) and human (293T and A549) cells. Because the human 293T and A549 cells maintained higher transduction efficacy (Fig. 2B) , it can be reasonably inferred that both the avian-origin H5N1 and the swine-origin H1N1 viruses isolated from avian (goose) and humans have a higher tendency to infect humans than other hosts, such as Chinese hamster and African green monkey.

Three of ten selected mAbs were able to neutralize infection by the pseudovirus carrying HA from the homologous H5N1 IAV, while none of them neutralized pseudoviruses expressing HA from heterologous IAVs and the unrelated VSV-G pseudovirus in the tested cell lines (Fig. 3B) , the result of which is highly consistent with that from microneutralization assay ( Table 2 ). These findings demonstrated that the established pseudovirus neutralization assay is highly specific and sensitive, thus making it especially suited to the quick screening of a large amount of mAbs in a short period of time. Compared with microneutralization assay and plaque reduction neutralization assay that require the handling of a live virus and the use of approved BSL-3 laboratory facilities, the established non-infectious virus-based pseudovirus neutralization assay is relatively safer and particularly useful when access to a BSL-3 laboratory is restricted.",

Thus, application of the pseudovirus neutralization assay may be extended to evaluate the efficacy of HA-based influenza vaccine candidates and antiviral agents targeting HA of IAVs. This neutralization method could also be optimized for detecting specific neutralizing activity of clinical patient samples, which may be useful for predicting prognosis of the disease. To conclude, the HA pseudovirus-based neutralizing assay can be applied to screen neutralizing mAbs and therapeutics targeting IAV HA, and to evaluate the HA-based IAV vaccines, as well as to detect neutralizing activity of clinical samples, making it possible to assess virus-neutralizing activities safely and rapidly without using live infectious influenza viruses. The detection limit is 1:100. a Using pseudovirus neutralization assay. b Using microneutralization assay.",
