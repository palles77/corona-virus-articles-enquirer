            "text": "Background: In experimental studies viral infections have been shown to induce type 2 inflammation in asthmatics, but whether this is a feature of naturally occurring virus-induced asthma exacerbations is unknown. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) released from the airway epithelium in response to damage, has been suggested as a link between viral infection and type 2 inflammation, but the role of TSLP in asthma exacerbations is unknown. Objective: To assess whether type 2 inflammation, as measured by sputum eosinophils and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), is a feature of naturally occurring virus-induced exacerbations of asthma and whether TSLP is associated with this type 2 inflammation. Methods: Patients presenting to hospital with acute asthma were examined during the exacerbation, and after 4 weeks recovery. The assessments included spirometry, FeNO and induced sputum for differential counts and TSLP mRNA levels. Nasal swabs were collected for viral detection. Results: Sputum eosinophils and FeNO were similar between virus-positive (n \u00bc 44) and negative patients (n \u00bc 44). In virus-positive patients, TSLP expression was lower at exacerbation than follow-up (p \u00bc 0.03). High TSLP at exacerbation was associated with lower sputum eosinophils (p \u00bc 0.01) and higher FEV1 (p \u00bc 0.03). In virus-positive patients, %-predicted FEV1 negatively correlated with both FeNO and sputum eosinophils (p \u00bc 0.02 and p \u00bc 0.05, respectively). Conclusion: Our findings support that type 2 inflammation is present in patients during virus-induced asthma exacerbations, to the same degree as non-viral exacerbations, and correlate negatively with FEV1. However, in virus-positive patients, high TSLP expression during exacerbation was associated with low sputum eosinophils, suggesting that the effect of TSLP in vivo, in the setting of an asthma exacerbation, might be different than the type 2 inducing effects observed in experimental studies.",

However, in vitro studies have suggested that respiratory viruses are capable of independently inducing type 2 inflammation, by causing a release of proinflammatory cytokines, including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), from the airway epithelium [7, 8] . In this innate immune pathway, TSLP causes release of type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13, from T-cells through activation of dendritic cells [9] and by direct action on innate lymphoid cells (ILC) [10] . TSLP is increased in patients with asthma, compared to controls [11] and anti-TSLP antibodies have been shown to reduce airway inflammation in response to an allergen provocation test [12] . Epithelial cells from asthmatics seem to be particular prone to TSLP release following exposure to viral infection in vitro [8] but whether TSLP is induced in asthmatics during viral infection in vivo and stimulates type 2 inflammation is unknown.",

Because patients were examined during an exacerbation, they were not asked to withhold beta-2-agonists prior to spirometry, but the time since the last dose of reliever was taken was recorded. Induced sputum was processed as described by Pavord et al. [23] : In brief, after inhalation of 1 mg terbutaline, sputum was induced by inhalation of hypertonic saline in increasing concentrations (3%, 4%, and 5%) for 5 min each (total duration 15 min). Sputum plugs were selected and processed, cytospins were prepared, and a differential cell count of 400 nonsquamous cells was completed. The hospital clinical laboratory completed a full white blood cell differential count and measured high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), total IgE and specific IgE to common allergens (grasses, house dust mite, birch, mugwort, dog, cat, horse, Cladosporium herbarum and Alternaria tenuis). Atopy was defined as the presence of specific IgE (>0.35 IU/ml) to one or more of these allergens. Asthma control was assessed with the 5item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) [24] .",
