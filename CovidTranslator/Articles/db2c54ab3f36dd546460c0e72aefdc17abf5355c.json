Despite advances in asthma management, acute exacerbations continue to be a major problem in patients and they result in a considerable burden on direct/indirect health care providers. A severe exacerbation occurring within 1 year is an independent risk factor. Respiratory tract viruses have emerged as the most frequent triggers of exacerbations in children. It is becoming increasingly clear that interactions may exist between viruses and other triggers, increasing the likelihood of an exacerbation. In this study, we provide an overview of current knowledge about asthma exacerbations, including its definition, impact on health care providers, and associated factors. Prevention management in intermittent asthma as well as intermittent wheeze in pre-school children and those with persistent asthma are discussed. Our review findings support the importance of controlling persistent asthma, as indicated in current guidelines. In addition, we found that early episodic intervention appeared to be crucial in preventing severe attacks and future exacerbations. Besides the use of medication, timely education after an exacerbation along with a comprehensive plan in follow up is also vitally important.",

            "text": "Asthma is the most common pediatric chronic respiratory disease, affecting 7.4% of children in central Taiwan, 1 19 .7% in northern Taiwan, 2 and up to 32.6% in the Western world. 3 Exacerbation is a component of asthma that has a significant impact on both the child and the child's family. An exacerbation is often the initial event that precedes diagnosis of this disease and constitutes the majority of acute care events in children. 4 Despite advances in asthma management and the introduction of guidelines specifically for pediatric asthma, acute exacerbations continue to occur and impose considerable morbidity on pediatric patients, thereby placing a considerable strain on health care resources as well as on the lives of affected children and their families. 5 In the Asia-Pacific region, a survey conducted in 2006 6 showed persistently poor control in asthmatic children. Compared with the results of a survey conducted in 2000, 7 there has been no subsequent decrease in urgent care due to asthma exacerbation (44% in 2000 vs. 43% in 2006), including emergency department (ED) visits (19% vs. 19%) , and hospitalization (15% vs. 17%). The urgent care rate in asthma patients may be as high as 43%. Real-world surveys conducted in the USA and Europe also revealed a considerable burden on patients and health care providers associated with asthma exacerbation. 8, 9 Current guidelines assess asthma control based on two main facets: clinical control and future risk. 10 The presence of an exacerbation has been shown to be equal to impairment in assessing the level of control. However, the two domains are not necessarily concordant. Patients may be well controlled in the impairment domain and be receiving optimal medications, yet still experience a severe exacerbation. 11e13 The current interest in this aspect of asthma is reflected in numerous recent publications examining exacerbations from various points of view. Furthermore, the International Collaboration in Asthma, Allergy and Immunology (iCAALL), recently formed by the EAACI, AAAAI, ACAAI, and WAO, has proposed an International Consensus on (ICON) Pediatric Asthma in 2012 14 and emphasizes the management of exacerbations to be a major consideration, independent of chronic treatment. iCAALL considers \"improved asthma exacerbation treatment\" to be \"an important unmet need\"; and thus recommends undertaking core research with a view to developing \"new medication and/or strategies.\" The aim of the present study was to provide a review of recent reports on clinical practicability in asthma/wheeze exacerbation, with a particular emphasis on investigations highlighting findings that have not yet been fully discussed in the present guidelines (Table  1) . Recent research on novel therapeutic modalities is not included in this review.",

Although a detailed assessment of severity and treatment for exacerbation was first proposed in guidelines many years ago, the definition of asthma exacerbation remains controversial. 14, 15 In the most recently published consensus in pediatric asthma in 2013, asthma exacerbation was defined as an acute or subacute episode of progressive increase in asthma symptoms, associated with airflow obstruction. 14 The most commonly included exacerbation outcomes are the need for systemic corticosteroids, urgent unscheduled care, emergency department (ED) or urgent care (UC) visits, and hospitalizations for asthma. 15 In young children, recurrent wheezing is a challenge in asthma diagnosis. In the PRACTALL consensus report published in 2008, 16 the \"phenotypes\" of \"persistent wheezing\", \"intermittent severe wheezing\", and \"nonatopic wheezing (mainly triggered by virus infection)\" were proposed. These three phenotypes are very similar to asthma exacerbation in young children. It is difficult to diagnose asthma in young children and infancy; however, several publications have yielded useful finding, on prevention of severe wheezing attack and future wheezing in this age group, especially those with high asthma prediction index (API). These publications are discussed later in this review.",

Eighteen percent of children required one or more ED visits due to asthma in the past year. 9 In the Asia-Pacific area, unscheduled care (UC) costs were responsible for 18e90% of total per-patient direct costs. Overall, total per-patient direct costs were equivalent to 13% of per capita gross domestic product and 300% of per capita healthcare spending, 18 which do not include indirect social/economic costs. In Taiwan, the percentages of hospitalizations and ED visits for asthma patients were estimated to be 12% and 25% per year, respectively, which is equivalent to 1.2 in-patient days and 0.59 ED visits per patient per year, respectively. 18 An analysis of data collected from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research database in 2002 showed that overall health expenditure in pediatric asthma patients was 2.2 times higher than that in patients without asthma, and one-fourth of the cost for asthmatic children was attributed to hospitalization and UC. 19 ",

Even among patients with controlled asthma, 43% had an unscheduled visit to a physician's office, 10% had an emergency department visit, and 3% had a hospitalization in the previous year. 8 Adequate management of persistent asthma includes treatment with controller medications such as inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), which have been consistently shown to reduce the risk of severe disease exacerbations. 22, 23 Poor adherence to medicine is an important contributing factor to poor asthma control. A recent study 24 showed that children with poor adherence to ICS had a 21% increase in ED visits and a 70% increase in hospitalization.",

Investigators compared children experiencing an exacerbation with those who had well-controlled asthma. Respiratory tract virus infection was associated with exacerbation in 63.1% of the patients compared with 23.4% in individuals with well-controlled asthma (OR 5.6; 95% CI, 2.7e11.6). 32 Although several viruses have been found in asthmatics, rhinovirus has been the most commonly identified virus in proven viral-induced asthma exacerbations in children aged 6e17 years (55%) and in infants/pre-school children (33%). Other viruses detected and associated with asthma exacerbation included respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, coronavirus, and human metapneumovirus. 33 ",

The T allele of the IL-13 gene promoter SNP (rs1800925) was associated with an increased risk of exacerbations among those receiving ICS. 42 Three low-affinity IgE receptor gene(F C \u03b5R2) SNPs were significantly associated with elevated IgE level, and each was associated with increased severe exacerbations in white children. 43 Racial differences must be taken into consideration in gene studies. In Taiwan, Chen et al 44 also reported a common variant of a gene coding for the Cala cell 10 kDa protein to be a candidate determinant of asthma severity and steroid response in Chinese asthmatic children. More recently, Bisgaard et al, investigated gene variants associated with asthma and exacerbation in early childhood. Variation at the 17q12-q21 locus was associated with an approximately twofold increased risk of recurrent wheeze, asthma exacerbations, and bronchial hyperreactivity from early infancy to school age, but without conferring risk of eczema, rhinitis, or allergen sensitization. 45 This report adds to the growing evidence of genetic variation in susceptibility to exacerbations, particularly in non-atopic asthma, and further supports the existence of an independent presence of exacerbations. Overall, the finding that genetic variations affect severe exacerbation demonstrates the need to consider the interaction of genes with other known factors in the evaluation of children with frequent exacerbations.",

Nevertheless, during the follow-up course, there are often severe wheezing attacks that happen intermittently, especially when there is respiratory tract infection. The PRACTALL consensus proposed the concept of \"virus-induced asthma\" in which colds are the most common precipitating factor, and which also explains how some children can be completely well between symptomatic periods. 16 Regarding the daily adherence and possible adverse effects of daily inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), several studies have investigated the effects of intermittent therapy for this phenotype in recent years and the results have been instructive in pediatric clinical practice. For children aged 12e59 months with moderate to severe intermittent wheezing, early use of budesonide inhalation or montelukast in addition to albuterol for 7 days showed a modest reduction in trouble breathing and interference of activity compared with the placebo group, and the effects were particularly significant in those with positive asthma predictive indices. The effects were comparable in these two groups. However, neither episodic budesonide (1 mg twice daily, via nebulizer), nor montelukast (4 mg daily) showed differences in event-free days, oral corticosteroid use, health care use, quality of life, or linear growth when compared with the placebo group. 47 Another study from Canada 48 enrolled children aged 1e6 years with at least 3 previous wheezing attacks and at least one moderate to severe attack in the past 6 months in order to investigate the pre-emptive use of inhaled fluticasone for virusinduced wheezing. The study group received fluticasone 750 mg twice daily at the onset of upper respiratory infection and continued for a maximum of 10 days. In the 6e12month study period, the fluticasone group showed decreased rescue systemic corticosteroid usage (OR 0.49, 95% CI Z 0.3e0.83), but they suffered from smaller gains in height and weight. Therefore, its long-term benefits require further clarification.",

The mean exposure to budesonide was 104 mg less with the intermittent regimen than with the daily regimen.

In this 12-month, doubleblind, randomized study, 341 children aged 4e11 years with uncontrolled asthma received regular ICS with an average daily dosage up to budesonide 320 mg. SMART showed 70% and 79% (p < 0.001) reductions in exacerbation compared with groups receiving high-dose budesonide (320 mg qd) \u00fe terbutaline 0.4 mg as rescue and symbicort 80/4.5 mg qd \u00fe terbutaline 0.4 mg as rescue, respectively. The SMART regimen also reduced mild exacerbation days and nighttime awakening. The yearly height growth was better than that of the high-dose budesonide group. The good result consequently led to several trials using the SMART approach in several countries. In 2011, Cochrane published a meta-analysis of combined fluticasone and salmeterol versus fixed dose combination of budesonide and formoterol for treatment of chronic asthma in adults and children. 55 In the present analysis, the SMART regimen was not found to significantly decrease severe exacerbations. The conclusion of this meta-analysis was that the imprecise estimates of exacerbation indicate that further research is warranted. Indeed, more recent studies on the SMART regimen have yielded different results.",

They concluded that asthma education aimed at children (and their caregivers) who present to the ED for acute exacerbations can result in lower risk of future ED presentation and hospital admission. 58 Schatz et al also reviewed evidence of the effectiveness of follow-up after acute asthma episodes. 59 Recommendations based on their findings are listed below: (1) telephone reminders of appointments should be used to improve the effectiveness of patient follow-up after the ED visit, and if possible, appointments should be made before leaving the ED; (2) patients' chronic severity should be characterized by items in asthma guidelines; (3) specific elements should be included in the follow-up visit, such as controller, inhaler technique, selfmonitoring, individualized asthma action plan, trigger identification, avoidance instruction, and further follow-up plans; (4) patients should be referred to a specialist when indicated.",

Respiratory viruses are now well accepted as the main trigger of these exacerbations, and rhinoviruses remain the most commonly detected pathogens. The interaction of virus and sensitized allergen in pediatric asthma/wheeze patients needs further clarification, which should include the role of genetic variation. At present, early episodic treatment modalities provide some benefit, albeit to a limited extent, in reducing the impact of exacerbation, but more research needs to be done, especially with regard to identifying subgroups of response. In our review of the literature it is apparent that patients with previous severe exacerbation, positive asthma predictive indices, and multiple allergen sensitization require special attention and need to be educated about these aspects of their disease. Pediatricians must be capable of identifying the signs and symptoms of patients with chronic asthma so that families can be educated to detect imminent exacerbation and adhere to the asthma control plan.
