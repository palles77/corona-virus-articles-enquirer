Current influenza modeling efforts considering responsive behavior either oversimplify the process and may underestimate pandemic impacts, or make other problematic assumptions and are therefore constrained in utility. This study develops an agent-based model for pandemic simulation, and incorporates individual responsive behavior in the model based on public risk communication literature. The resultant model captures the stochastic nature of epidemic spread process, and constructs a realistic picture of individual reaction process and responsive behavior to pandemic situations. The model is then applied to simulate the spread dynamics of 2009 H1N1 influenza in a medium-size community in Arizona. Simulation results illustrate and compare the spread timeline and scale of this pandemic influenza, without and with the presence of pubic risk communication and individual responsive behavior. Sensitivity analysis sheds some lights on the influence of different communication strategies on pandemic impacts. Those findings contribute to effective pandemic planning and containment, particularly at the beginning of an outbreak.",

Different types of models have also been developed, from the early differential equation compartmental model to more recent large-scale individual-based stochastic models (Bobashev et al. 2007 ). Despite insightful findings provided, those models usually consider the complex issue without its crucial social or human factors. They often assume that, individuals do not change their behaviors during an influenza pandemic but continue with regular activities (Yoo et al. 2010) . Empirical studies, however, have reported different phenomena. Many individuals when confronted with a pandemic undertake actions (e.g., wearing face masks and washing hands more frequently) to protect themselves (Lau et al. 2007 ). Those self-protective actions could reduce their probabilities of infection, and largely change the spread dynamics of the pandemic, particularly at the beginning of its outbreak (Ekberg et al. 2009 ).",

The second simulation approach considers the heterogeneity in individuals' behavioral responses.

Relevant modeling efforts have also realized its importance and developed two approaches to achieve this purpose. The first approach is to introduce the concept of prevalence elastic behavior into simulation models, which refers to the adaptive actions people take in response to an epidemic (Philipson 2000; Philipson and Posner 1993) . Individuals in these models are assumed to reduce their overall contacts with other people due to a pandemic, and the degree of reduction depends on the epidemic's propagation condition. This assumption is also called the mass action incidence assumption (Larson and Nigmatulina 2010) . For example, both Larson and Nigmatulina (2009) and Yoo et al. (2010) make the parameter of daily contact rate in their models a variable instead of a constant. The value for this parameter is less than the average normal-day contact rate and varies during the simulation with the size of remaining non-infected population.",

They neglect the heterogeneity in human responses to pandemic situations. According to public risk communication literature, people in emergency contexts could receive risk information. Risk information informs them of potential threats and available self-protective actions, and initiates their reaction processes to the situation (Donner 2006) . This reaction process is highly social and complex. It generally consists of several sequential stages (Quarantelli 1990 ). Upon receiving risk information, individuals develop their interpretations of the message and formulate their understandings on whether the risk communicated is real. They then seek additional information mainly from their personal contacts to verify their understandings, and define their own situations regarding whether they are personally endangered.",

Same responses occur when they cannot confirm the risk through personal contacts or do not consider themselves as targets of the risk (Parker et al. 2009 ). Previous studies also find that, individuals under some circumstances tend to take certain actions not necessarily providing protections (e.g., Donner 2007) . Therefore, not all individuals respond as expected by taking self-protective actions.

This number still remained high ( 40%) even after the local health authority initiated vigorous communitywide SARS preventive activities. Later studies likewise find a large percentage of individuals not taking self-protective actions during the 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak in China (e.g., Lau et al. 2009 ), in England (e.g., Rubin et al. 2009 ), in Saudi Arabia (e.g., Balkhy et al. 2010) , and in India (e.g., Kamate et al. 2009 ).

The latter maintain their constant normal-day contact rates throughout the simulation. Those modifications enable individuals in different compartments to have varying responsive behaviors.

Simulating the community as a friendship network is mainly for two reasons. First, the contacts between friends constitute an important part of individuals' daily contacts for influenza virus transmission (Potter et al. 2012) . Second, public risk communication literature suggests that, most people tend to seek confirmative information from their friends to verify their initial perceptions (Perry and Lindell 2003) . Friendship network therefore provides the necessary basis to simulate individuals' daily contacts and their reaction processes in the modeling context. This study adopts the approach developed by Hamill and Gilbert (2008 to construct the friendship network. 3 The network thus generated has the key features of a friendship network previously identified, including high clustering (Watts 1999) , giant components (Newman 2001) , and a right-skewed distribution on the degrees of connectivity (Roberts et al. 2009 ). The generated network is highly clustered. Its global clustering coefficient is 0.52 and average local clustering coefficient 0.51. 88.6% of all individuals are connected directly or indirectly in the network, indicating the existence of a giant component. The degrees of connectivity follow a right-skewed distribution, with a mean of 11 and a much smaller median of 4. Meanwhile, the network is assumed to be stable over time, given that the turnover of a friendship connection is slow relative to the timescale of a pandemic (Keeling and Eames 2005) . But when some individual dies, it and all its connections would be removed from the environment, while the rest part of the network remains unchanged.",

After social confirmation, the individual defines its situation as to whether and to what extent it is personally at risk and therefore self-protective actions should be taken. This situational definition depends on both the initial perception and social confirmation result. Public risk communication literature has been silent on how individuals use all information received and collected to define their situations. This study simulates this stage based on the innovation diffusion model developed by Delre et al. (2006) . In Delre et al.'s model, the probability for an individual to adopt certain innovation is calculated as the summation of two factors: the individual's initial perception after receiving advertising information, and the social influence from its friends regarding whether they have adopted the innovation. This social process is very similar as how individuals behave at the situational definition stage. Individuals develop a propensity to take certain action which could improve their benefits, and the propensity is simultaneously decided by their initial perceptions and their friends' actions.

Third, certain percent of individuals (information coverage) are randomly selected among the population to receive risk information.

Risk information is sent out in the community with a coverage of 5% and a frequency of 1 day; namely, 5% of the population are randomly selected at each time step to be informed of the influenza. Pilot experiments show that, the influenza dies out in a short time period in the community if the simulation is initialized with less than 2% infectious population. For example, the influenza dies out within a month in more than 40 out of 100 experiments when the initial infectious population is 0.5% or less. The situation occurs less frequently as the percent increases. When the percent is 1.8 or 1.9%, the influenza dies out within a month in 2 out of 100 experiments. After the percent reaches 2%, the situation no longer takes place in 100 experiments. To simulate the influenza outbreak as a public emergency in all experiments, the simulation starts with 2% of the population randomly chosen to have infected state; all other individuals are initially susceptible. 4 Epidemiologic parameters are related to the biological features of 2009 H1N1 influenza.

They are recorded by the end of each experiment. The latter two indicators are the percent of population in infected state on each day (morbidity), and the percent of population ever infected by each day since season beginning (cumulative morbidity). They reflect the influenza diffusion process and are recorded per time step. For each scenario, the average value of 100 experiments for each indicator is presented as below. Table 2 summarizes the simulation results on pandemic impacts in each scenario, and Figs. 2 and 3 show how the morbidity and cumulative morbidity change over time. When there is no public intervention and all individuals behave as normal, the morbidity grows exponentially shortly after the pandemic is initiated. It peaks on November 6, 2009 (34th time step), and 6.43% of the community population are in infected state on that day.

Large-scale risk education programs or risk communication campaigns through a variety of mass media could help widely inform the public and reduce pandemic impacts. On the other hand, there is a threshold for the influence of this parameter. Increasing the information coverage after it reaches 15% has small effects to reduce the peak prevalence and epidemic size. Figure 4 also shows the impact of its variability on morbidity change over time. Almost identical epidemic curves are Dissemination frequency Dissemination frequency is how often the risk information is disseminated to the public. It is measured in once per number of days. For example, a frequency of 2 means risk information sent out once every 2 days. Its default value is 1, and changed to 2, 3, 4 and 5 here. Table 2 and Fig. 5 show the simulation results. Disseminating information less frequently generally increases pandemic impacts. When the frequency is 2, both the peak prevalence and epidemic size are increased by more than 25%, and the epidemic duration is shortened by one and a half months, compared to the default parameter setting. Changing the frequency from once every 2 days to once every 3 days still causes considerable increases in peak prevalence and epidemic size, but hardly influences the epidemic duration. Frequency changes have little effect on the occurrence time of peak prevalence. The morbidity peaks around November 4, 2009 (32nd time step) in each experiment scenario, as shown in Fig. 5 . Figure 5 also shows how the initial uncertainty in dissemination frequency influences the change of morbidity over time. The general pattern indicates a threshold of once every 3 days. Simulations with a frequency of three or more generate epidemic curves of great similarities. This finding could also be observed in Table 2 . As long as risk information is sent out less frequently than once every 3 days, variations of this parameter exert little influence on peak prevalence, epidemic size and epidemic duration. Effective pandemic control therefore requires public risk information disseminated to the public more frequently than this threshold value. ",

Previous studies have consistently demonstrated that, individuals by adopting self-protective actions could decrease their infection probabilities and further change the pandemic spread process and reduce its negative social impacts (Ferguson et al. 2005; Taylor et al. 2009 ). For example, many studies consider individuals' voluntary action of reducing their social contacts an effective means to control the SARS spread (e.g., WHO 2003) . Individual responsive behavior thus becomes an integral component of influenza modeling. On the other hand, people respond to pandemic situations in a complex way. Current simulation approaches considering individual responsive behavior either oversimplify the process and inaccurately estimate the pandemic impact, or make other problematic assumptions and are therefore constrained in utility. It remains a challenge to construct a realistic picture of human behavioral response in influenza modeling (Funk et al. 2015) . This study responds to the challenge by developing an alternative approach for influenza pandemic simulation with individual responsive behavior. The approach should be distinguished based on two features from its previous counterparts. First, important types of heterogeneities for epidemic simulation need to be considered, and the interactive and stochastic nature of epidemic spread process captured. Second, the human behavioral component requires more accurate representation in the simulation. Agent-based modeling among other influenza modeling methods is more appropriate to implement the approach. Barrat et al. (2008) summarize another three distinct methods. Homogeneous mixing and multi-scale models assume a homogeneous random mixing of people and cannot incorporate heterogeneities. Social structure models fail to consider interpersonal contact patterns, and none of the three types of models could include responsive behavior at the individual level.",

For example, the created model constructs interpersonal interactions and introduces heterogeneities into individuals' biological reactions to the disease. Particularly, the parameter of infection probability enables the heterogeneity in susceptible individuals' vulnerability and resistance to an influenza (Huang et al. 2005) . Exposed and infected individuals are assumed to be randomly decided whether to evolve health states based on certain probability. This assumption allows for the heterogeneities empirically found in individuals' latent and infected periods of 2009 H1N1 influenza (CDC 2009). For the human response component, the model explicitly frames each individual's reaction process and responsive behavior based on theories and empirical data from public risk communication literature.",

On the one side, the structure of interpersonal contacts is critical in determining the epidemiological pattern observed in contagious disease spread (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Previous agent-based models have either relied on priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis, or simply used certain type of network (Edmunds et al. 1997) . Few of them parameterize the model with empirical data on interpersonal interactions, as advocated by current epidemic simulation studies . On the other side, individual responsive behavior has rarely been integrated into influenza spread dynamics in agent-based models. The created model empirically maps the dynamic contact pattern for influenza transmission, and appropriately considers relevant human factors. It helps advance agent-based influenza modeling efforts.",

Non-pharmaceutical measures play a salient role when a novel pandemic strain of influenza is found and no vaccination or antivirals is generally available. Compared with other non-pharmaceutical measures (e.g., school closure, travel restriction and quarantine), initiating self-protective actions through public risk communication is at lower costs, less socially disruptive and more acceptable for individuals (Cowling et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2010) . Previous studies have also widely supported its effectiveness in pandemic spread containment (e.g., Vaughan and Tinker 2009) . Our simulation results indicate that public risk communication and individuals' self-protective actions could greatly reduce the pandemic impact, and help buy time to introduce other public interventions, particularly the production and distribution of enough vaccines for the general public. Although public managers cannot solely rely on it to manage adverse social outcomes, public risk communication makes the situation less devastating.",

The sensitivity analysis sheds some lights on this issue, but not systematic enough. Public managers can change their risk communication strategies by varying the information coverage, transmission channel, dissemination frequency, and information content and style, to encourage more individuals to take self-protective actions (Donner 2007 ). The current model could further link those attributes with individual reaction process and responsive behavior, and explore how different communication strategies influence influenza spread dynamics. Furthermore, other public interventions are often used with the presence of public risk communication and individual behavioral responses. The model could further include vaccination and other containment measures, and provide better understanding of their influences on pandemic impacts.",

The value for some parameters in the model cannot be determined empirically, particularly the population characteristics on public risk communication (e.g., information coverage) and those related to individual reaction process (e.g., social influence effect). Since few studies can be referenced, this study assumes their values and conducts sensitivity analysis. Meanwhile, the contexts in existing studies generally differ from one another and the parameter value from one context cannot be simply applied to another. For example, the initial perception often varies greatly with communities, time periods, and epidemics. A more thorough work of model parameterization is needed in future research. Agent-based modeling is a sharp tool for pandemic influenza simulation, but is also time and resource demanding. The target social system simulated in the model is a medium-size community in Arizona. The influenza spread dynamics in the entire population of the state or of a large city is not considered due to limited computational capacity. On the other hand, this study is interested in pandemic influenza spread via individual interactions. The focus on a medium-size community allows a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions at the local level, and inferences can still be made on larger groups from the analysis (Eidelson and Lustick 2004) .",

With further verification and validation, it could serve as an exploration instrument in decision-making process to carry out comprehensive evaluations of intervention strategy choices and help select appropriate pandemic control measures.
