Studies of random sequence libraries, however, suggest that young de novo proteins will not fold into compact, specific structures typical of native globular proteins. Here we show that Bsc4, a functional, natural de novo protein encoded by a gene that evolved recently from noncoding DNA in the yeast S. cerevisiae, folds to a partially specific three-dimensional structure. Bsc4 forms soluble, compact oligomers with high b sheet content and a hydrophobic core, and undergoes cooperative, reversible denaturation. Bsc4 lacks a specific quaternary state, however, existing instead as a continuous distribution of oligomer sizes, and binds dyes indicative of amyloid oligomers or molten globules. The combination of native-like and non-native-like properties suggests a rudimentary fold that could potentially act as a functional intermediate in the emergence of new folded proteins de novo.",

            "text": "Protein folding is difficult and poses a potential roadblock to evolving protein structures from scratch. In classic textbook views, natural proteins such as myoglobin fold cooperatively into specific, stable, soluble, globular structures; these elegant, intricate native states then serve as scaffolds for biological functions such as oxygen binding. Such native structures are, however, rare among amino acid sequences. Soluble proteins with significant secondary structure content have been recovered from unevolved random amino acid sequence libraries, but they do not have specific, well-defined tertiary structures (Chiarabelli et al., 2006; Davidson et al., 1995; Doi et al., 1998) . Even when such libraries are biased toward compositions or patterns found in natural proteins, the structures recovered tend to have ''rudimentary'' or ''molten globule'' characteristics lacking clearly specific tertiary structure (Graziano et al., 2008; Labean et al., 2011; Matsuura et al., 2002) . Only in a single well-known case, in which random sequence libraries were subjected to extensive in vitro functional evolution, have clearly native-like structures been recovered (Keefe and Szostak, 2001; Lo Surdo et al., 2004; Mansy et al., 2007) . Even among ancient, highly evolved sequences with specific native states, chaperones are often necessary to avoid pitfalls such as aggregation. The difficulty of folding is one justification for the common perception that evolution conservatively ''tinkers'' with an ancient repertoire, for example by duplicating and modifying existing protein-coding genes, instead of inventing entirely new proteins (Jacob, 1977; Zuckerkandl, 1975) .",

Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that cannot fold independently are a sizable minority of proteins and serve a variety of biological functions (Dyson and Wright, 2005; Meszaros et al., 2007; Schlessinger et al., 2011; Tompa and Kovacs, 2010) . IDPs vary widely in the level of disorder, from random coils to ''pre-molten globules'' to molten globule states, which are able to fold compactly and have high levels of secondary structure but lack specific tertiary structures (Dunker and Obradovic, 2001; Habchi et al., 2014; Uversky, 2002) . Molten globule states may be functional (DeGrado, 1993; Pervushin et al., 2007; Vamvaca et al., 2004) , and even the most IDPs can function through short linear binding motifs (Davey et al., 2012) . A functional protein might therefore evolve de novo even if it cannot fold specifically. A protein born as an IDP might later evolve more native-like properties (Zhu et al., 2016) or continue indefinitely as a partially or completely disordered protein.",

Recently born de novo proteins have been predicted by sequence analysis to have high levels of intrinsic disorder on average (Wilson et al., 2017) , but no systematic experimental study of their ability to fold has been done. The antifreeze protein AFGP from Antarctic notothenioid fishes contains a tripeptide repeat that evolved de novo from a splice junction in a trypsinogen gene (Chen et al., 1997) , and the unusual structure of the repeat region, matching its unusual function as an antifreeze protein, has been probed by numerous methods (Urbanczyk et al., 2017) . Some structural data also exist for the special category of de novo proteins encoded by viral ''overprinted'' genes, which evolved from an alternative reading frame of an existing coding gene, rather than from noncoding DNA. Overprinting proteins are generally predicted to have high intrinsic disorder Rancurel et al., 2009 ), but least two are known to fold into specific, compact, novel structures (Meier et al., 2006; Pavesi et al., 2013; Shukla and Hilgenfeld, 2015; Vargason et al., 2003) . It is not clear how old these proteins are, and they may retain little signature of their de novo origins. Their structures do, however, point to the existence of pathways for evolving nativelike folds de novo. No experimental structure of any de novo protein (young or old), verified to have evolved from a new open reading frame in noncoding DNA, has been reported.",

            "text": "As a step toward structural characterization of young de novo proteins, we present a case study of the yeast protein Bsc4. A serious issue with case studies of individual newborn genes is the difficulty in proving, in the absence of evolutionary conservation, that they are both protein coding and functional, in addition to proving that they arose from noncoding sequences (McLysaght and Hurst, 2016) . The yeast gene BSC4 is an exceptionally well-supported case of an entire functional proteincoding gene that recently evolved de novo from an ancestral noncoding sequence (Cai et al., 2008) . The name BSC4 (''bypass of stop codon'') derives from belonging to a set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae genes with 9%-25% stop codon bypass efficiency (Namy et al., 2003) . BSC4 is conserved in all strains of S. cerevisiae, but no homologous open reading frame is present in other fungal species, and the hypothetical Bsc4 protein sequence is not similar to any other known protein sequence. A thorough analysis of synteny and phylogeny among numerous fungal species demonstrated that BSC4 is homologous to, and evolved recently from, a region of noncoding DNA in the intergenic region between LYP1 and ALP1 (Cai et al., 2008) . BSC4 is nonessential but has two synthetic lethal partners (RPN4 and DUN1) (Pan et al., 2006) . Its sequence is >90% conserved across known S. cerevisiae strains ( Figure 1 ) and shows a low d N /d S ratio, indicating purifying selection. RT-PCR and mass spectrometry (MS) data demonstrate expression of BSC4 at the RNA and protein level, respectively, under normal culture conditions (Cai et al., 2008) . Heightened expression of BSC4 is observed in stationary phase (Aragon et al., 2008; Gasch et al., 2000) , and both synthetic lethal partners function in DNA damage repair pathways, suggesting that BSC4 plays a role in DNA damage repair during stationary phase (Cai et al., 2008) . Bsc4 is a functional, whole de novo protein-coding gene and, given its presence in only a single yeast species, a notably young one that can provide a window into de novo gene origin.",

The BSC4 gene is expressed, at least at the transcript level, in both strains (Rossouw et al., 2009) .",

Both sequences contain four cysteine residues, which in principle may form disulfide bonds.

A sample of Bsc4 EC1118 supplied at $250 mM concentration in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM TCEP buffer was estimated to be hexameric based on size-exclusion calibration. Ion mobility-MS (IM-MS) plots of Bsc4 in 500 mM ammonium acetate and 1 mM TCEP clearly show oligomers ranging from tetramer to heptamer ( Figure 3 ). Distinct features in the IM-MS plots ( Figure 3 ) demonstrate narrow distributions of drift times, indicating compact conformations of the ions. The MS data do not suggest bias toward oligomers with even or odd numbers of subunits ( Figure S2 ). In a second sample supplied in 100 mM ammonium acetate, 1 mM DTT was estimated to be tetrameric by size exclusion; mass spectra of this sample show oligomers from dimer to hexamer ( Figure S3 ). Long (S288C) and short (EC1118) versions of Bsc4 give different oligomer distributions (Figure 2 ), suggesting that the hydrophobic C-terminal tail (IVIIYVVRFH) has some influence on oligomer formation. Oligomer sizes for S288C show a stronger size dependence on refolding conditions. At low salt and low pH, the apparent molecular weight for S288C is slightly smaller (dimer versus tetramer), while at high pH and high salt large aggregates are seen, even at the void volume ($8 mL) corresponding to the column exclusion limit ($40 MDa). The apparent size of Bsc4 or 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM KCl (cyan). All solutions contained 0.2 mM EDTA, plus 1 mM TCEP as a reducing agent. To show estimated oligomer sizes, peaks are annotated with nearest integral number of Bsc4 subunits, based on the molecular weight calculated from a five-protein calibration curve (see the STAR Methods). Initial concentration for refolding of Bsc4 EC1118 was 250 mM, while that of Bsc4 S288C was 158 mM. Based on separate experiments to measure concentration dependence ( Figure S5 ), initial protein concentration differences of this magnitude for either protein lead to only small differences in elution volume of refolded protein.

We were able to assign the strongest resonances to regions near the N terminus (3-14) and C terminus (95-98 and 105-121). TALOS analysis of chemical shifts (Figure S6) shows low S 2 values (<0.7) for these residues, indicative of highly dynamic character, which is also consistent with the low spectral dispersion and high intensity of the amide peaks. In addition, peptides released during limited trypsinolysis correspond primarily to these regions of sequence, while other regions appear to be protected ( Figure S6 ). These findings support the predictions by JRONN and IUPRED that the termini are the least-ordered regions (Figure 1 ). The rest of the sequence (residues 15-95, approximately) likely contains a folded domain, and the apparent resistance to proteolysis suggests that it may have a high level of structural order. The lack of clearly assignable resonances, and the lack of wide chemical shift dispersion, may reflect the absence of a unique quaternary and/or tertiary structure for the folded regions; alternatively, or additionally, it may reflect line broadening due to the high molecular weight of the oligomers (a pentamer of Bsc4 EC1118 has M r $75 kDa, for example).

We tested the binding of both Bsc4 variants to Congo red, Thioflavin T, and ANS, all of which have been reported to bind oligomeric amyloid intermediates (Fandrich, 2012) . Changes in ANS fluorescence upon binding have also classically been used as a measure of molten globule character (Ptitsyn, 1995) . Bsc4 oligomers of both variants bind all three dyes (Figure 8) , showing a shift in the absorbance maximum of Congo red, with the largest difference near 550 nm; enhancement of fluorescence at 480 nm for Thioflavin T; and a large enhancement of fluorescence plus a blue shift of the maximum from $535 to $480 nm for ANS.

These properties include compactness, stable secondary structure, side-chain burial, cooperative denaturation, and some resistance to proteolysis. The structure of Bsc4 is not entirely native-like, however, lacking a specific quaternary state. In addition, we found no conclusive evidence for specific tertiary interactions, and the behavior of Bsc4 in dye-binding experiments is similar to that of amyloid oligomers or molten globules. In sum, Bsc4 is neither an IDP (at least not a highly unfolded one), nor does it appear likely to be a uniquely folded globular protein. Some observations support a molten globule state, but protease resistance suggests a higher level of order, so its placement in common classifications of structural order, such as the Uversky quartet model, remains in some doubt (Uversky, 2002) . Bsc4 might be conservatively described as having a ''rudimentary fold'' (Labean et al., 2011) , and it also bears some comparison with a folding or misfolding intermediate. In any case, a nascent structure with such an unusual combination of properties seems reasonable for the ''birth'' of folding in a de novo evolved protein. Whether such proteins can later evolve more specific, native-like structures remains speculative.",

For very young, nascent proteins such as Bsc4, it may prove difficult to characterize structure at a resolution sufficient to assess structural novelty. Bsc4 has steadfastly resisted our attempts at crystallization thus far, and does not appear to be a good candidate for structure determination by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The apparent lack of dispersed amide resonances in NMR spectra despite deuteration ( Figure S6 ) may reflect dynamic conformational averaging within a ''molten'' structure. Alternatively, it could reflect static conformational heterogeneity, either among subunits within individual, low-symmetry oligomeric states, or in different high-symmetry oligomeric states (or some combination thereof). For dispersed NMR peaks in folded regions, static conformational heterogeneity could split peaks and thereby weaken their intensity to the point where they cannot be observed. If a single oligomeric state of Bsc4 could be isolated under some set of conditions, there might be more hope for high-resolution structural studies.",

Bsc4 EC1118 also contains three His residues, while Bsc4 S288C has four owing to an additional His residue at the C terminus. Lowering the pH from 7.5 to 5.5 is expected to lead to protonation of the histidines and an increase in the already large net positive charge, potentially increasing electrostatic repulsions between subunits in oligomers. Lowering the salt concentration from 250 to 100 mM would be expected to exacerbate such repulsions.

The affinity tag does have some effect on oligomer distribution, but the qualitative properties of Bsc4 S288C were largely independent of tag location. We further note that removal of the N-terminal tag for Bsc4 S288C by thrombin cleavage does not strongly affect the oligomerization behavior or secondary structure (Figure S10 ). As to cysteine oxidation, we focused on reduced Bsc4 based on the lack of secretion signals in the sequence and the reducing nature of the yeast cytosol under normal conditions (Lopez-Mirabal and Winther, 2008) . However, to test whether disulfide bonding could impart a more specific structure to the protein, we also tried refolding Bsc4 under nonreducing conditions (see the STAR Methods).

Typical Bsc4 concentrations under normal conditions in yeast are unknown, however, and could be lower. It is possible that, while Bsc4 is prone to form oligomers, the native functional form is monomeric, and it is unclear whether such a monomer would fold or be intrinsically disordered.

Expression plasmids encoding N-terminally tagged Bsc4 S288C and EC1118 were obtained starting from these constructs in the following way: first, a stop codon was introduced prior to the XhoI site by QuikChange mutagenesis to remove the sequence encoding the C-terminal tag; second, the resulting tagless constructs were digested with NdeI and XhoI; third, the NdeI-XhoI fragment was ligated into a pET-15b backbone produced by digestion with NdeI and XhoI. The pET-15b vector (Novagen) contains a sequence, upstream of the NdeI cloning site, that supplies an N-terminal MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSH affinity tag.",

To prevent disulfide bond formation, 15 mM b-mercaptoethanol was used in the lysis and wash buffers and 3-5 mM b-mercaptoethanol in the elution buffer. Proteins were then typically dialyzed into one of several refolding buffers of varying pH and salt concentration: 50 mM MES (pH 5.5), 100 mM KCl; 50 mM MES (pH 5.5), 250 mM KCl; 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl; or 50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 250 mM KCl. Each refolding buffer also contained 0.2 mM EDTA, and 1 mM TCEP to maintain cysteines in a reduced state. To test whether disulfide bonds could form and affect structure, however, we also conducted refolding experiments without 1 mM TCEP, as well as parallel 20-fold dilution refolding experiments into buffers containing either 1 mM TCEP or mixtures of oxidized (0.4 mM) and reduced (2 mM) glutathione, In both cases, standard Ellman's tests showed loss of 1-2 (out of 4) free cysteines in samples folded under nonreducing conditions. Such samples showed only minor differences in size exclusion elution volumes or near ultraviolet circular dichroism spectra, suggesting that any disulfide formation does not greatly perturb tertiary or quaternary structure of Bsc4.",

Due to a very slow rate of equilibration between oligomers (see Results), changes in the buffer prior to mass spectrometric analysis are not expected to alter the oligomer distribution significantly, making it possible to compare size distributions from mass spectra with those from size exclusion chromatography on the source samples. The mass spectrometry experiments were performed on a modified Waters Synapt G2S HDMS mass spectrometer (Wilmslow, U.K.) with an surface induced dissociation (SID) device installed between the truncated trap travelling wave ion guide (TWIG) and the ion mobility cell (Zhou et al., 2012) . The samples were sprayed with a nanoelectrospray source at a voltage of 1.0 kV. The sampling cone and source offset were set to 20 V. The gas flow rates for Trap, helium cell, and ion mobility cell were set to 10 mL/min, 120 mL/min, and 60 mL/min, respectively. The ion mobility wave velocity and wave height were 350 m/s and 16.0 V. The stoichiometry of the oligomers was confirmed by collision induced dissociation (CID) and SID, which are activation methods providing noncovalent products (Zhou et al., 2012) .

Changes in Congo Red absorbance appeared to saturate at $5 mM protein concentration, suggesting that binding is quite strong and that there are multiple Congo Red binding sites per Bsc4 subunit.
