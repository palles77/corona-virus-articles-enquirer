Although the alternative processes provide more flexible models for wider application than the GP, they may create difficulties in mathematical derivations. For example, the integral equations (1.1) and (1.3) can be obtained from the fact that X 2 + X 3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + X k d = aX 1 + aX 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + aX k\u22121 for the GP. However, such equality cannot be written for DGP. Therefore, it does not seem possible to obtain an integral equation for the DGP. Since the integral equations do not exist, Tang and Lam's method given in [12] or power series expansion given in [5] cannot be adapted to compute its mean value and second moment functions. In addition, the asymptotic expressions for the mean value and second moment functions of the DGP cannot be obtained by using the similar argument of this study since we use the Laplace transform of the integral equations (1 .1) and (1.3) . To the best of our knowledge, the only computational procedure for the mean value and second moment functions of the DGP is to obtain Monte Carlo estimation of these functions depending on the convolutions of the distribution functions proposed by [13] .",
