We previously cloned and characterized a novel jacalin-like lectin gene (Ta-JA1) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which codes a modular JRP with disease response and jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domains and is present only in the Gramineae family. The function of this protein is still unclear. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Ta-JA1 and related proteins from cereals grouped together, which diverged from JRL with an additional N-terminal disease response domain. The recombinant Ta-JA1 proteins agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes, and this hemagglutination activity was preferentially inhibited by mannose. The Ta-JA1 protein was able to inhibit E. coli cell growth. Overexpression of Ta-JA1 in transgenic tobacco plants increased their resistance to infection by tobacco bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens. Our results suggest that Ta-JA1 belongs to a mannosespecific lectin, which may confer a basal but broad-spectrum resistance to plant pathogens. Ta-JA1 and its homologues in maize, rice, sorghum and creeping bentgrass may represent a new type of monocot lectin with a modular structure and diversity of physiological functions in biotic and abiotic stress responses.",

Some of these JRPs with diverse physiological functions have been characterized in detail, such as proteinase-inhibitors [3, 4] , thionins [5, 6] , phytoalexin-synthesizing enzymes [7, 8] , cell wall proteins [9] , pathogenesis-related proteins and osmotin [10] , and lipoxygenase [11] . In barley leaves, jasmonate treatment activates the de novo synthesis and increases the accumulation of some proteins with relative molecular mass of 23,000 [12] , 32,000 and 37,000 [13] . However, the functions of the 32,000 proteins named JRP-32, are still unclear [14] . The JRP-32 mRNAs were first detected in jasmonate-treated barley leaves but these sequences are only present in the GenBank database (GenBank accession numbers AF021256, AF021257, AF021258) and no further experimental work has been documented. We have identified a cDNA encoding the wheat homologue for JRP-32 namely Ta-JA1 [14] . Ta-JA1 encoded protein together with some related proteins from Gramineae plants are modular proteins that contain the disease response and jacalinrelated lectin (JRL) domains. They form a small protein family related to JRLs.",

Lectins function as central mediators of information transfer in biological systems by interacting with glycoproteins, glycolipids and oligosaccharides [15] . Plant lectins can be classified into 12 families according to their molecular structures, biochemical properties and sugar-binding specificities. Some lectin families, such as the legume lectins and the chitin-binding lectins composed of hevein domains, have been extensively studied [16] . The other types of lectins, namely jacalin-related lectins and the amaranthin family lectins, are less well characterized [16] . It is generally suggested that most plant lectins are directed against foreign glycans and other organisms either in recognition or in defense-related processes and that they therefore may play a crucial part in defense response against different pathogens (bacteria and fungi), phytophagous invertebrates and herbivorous animals. There is also data to suggest that some lectins may be also involved in cellular regulation and signaling [17] .",

The mixture was kept for 1 h at room temperature and then examined visually for agglutination. The carbohydrate-binding specificity was determined by the inhibition of agglutination of rabbit erythrocytes with glucose, mannose, galactose and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which were serially diluted from a starting concentration of 300 mM. Solutions containing 10 mL of the purified Ta-JA1 and 10 mL saccharides were pre-incubated for 1 h, then 20 mL 2% rabbit erythrocyte suspension was added, and the agglutination was evaluated after 1 h at room temperature. The lowest concentration of saccharides that visibly decreased agglutination was defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC).",

Inhibition of hemagglutination was determined by serially diluting saccharides to inhibit agglutination of rabbit erythrocytes. The purified Ta-JA1 and simple saccharides solutions were pre-incubated for 1 h and rabbit erythrocytes were added. The agglutination was evaluated after 1 h at room temperature. The lowest concentration of saccharides that visibly inhibit agglutination was defined as MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration). increasing evidence that some newly identified lectins are induced by biotic or abiotic stimuli [17] . The jacalin-related lectins (JRL) may be involved in plant defense responses, particularly for the subfamily of mannose-specific homologues (mJRL). It has been shown that treatment with methyl jasmonate can induce lectin activity in the leaves of rice, barley, wheat, maize and rye. Purification and characterization of the cDNA clones revealed that these lectins all belong to cytoplasmic mJRL [42] . This suggests that the induction of mJRL by jasmonates is a common phenomenon in cereals. Ta-JA1 is similar in protein structure to mJRL, as it contains a jacalin-related domain and has the beta-prism architecture [14] . Furthermore, an N-terminal domain equivalent to disease response protein is found in Ta-JA1. This inducible JRL with modular structure has been proposed as a different type of JRL [17] . Here the phylogenetic analyses of JRLs and monocot mannose-binding lectins confirmed that Ta [43] . Crs-1 is a Ta-JA1 homologous gene in creeping bentgrass with up-regulation upon inoculation of dollar spot pathogen, implying a possible role in pathogen reactions [40] . There is currently no evidence for the involvement of Monocot JRL proteins in disease resistance. Probability values between the control and transgenic tobacco were estimated by the Student's t-test and significant differences at P 0.05 and P 0.01 levels are marked by * and **, respectively. ",

            "text": "The levels of Ta-JA1 protein in E. coli were quite low (Fig. 2) . Generally, the low levels of protein may be due to two reasons. Firstly it may be that some membrane proteins cannot be synthesized in E. coli cells [44] . Ta-JA1 protein could be induced at low temperature (Fig. 2) , therefore this was not case for Ta-JA1. Second, it may be that the induced protein is toxic to E. coli cells as is the case with the viscotoxins from European mistletoe (Viscum album L.) [45] . As shown in Fig. 3b , induction of Ta-JA1 protein markedly inhibited E. coli growth compared to control cells with just empty pET32a vector, with 55.8%e51.2% reduced cell density in logarithmic growth period. This indicated that the inhibition on cell growth of Ta-JA1 protein was caused by its toxicity to the cell. Direct supplement of the purified Ta-JA1 protein in LB medium, however, did not inhibit the growth of E. coli (unpublished data). This suggests that Ta-JA1 protein is active after entering the cell. Furthermore, the overexpression of Ta-JA1 gene in transgenic tobacco increased the disease resistance to bacterial (wildfire disease), fungal (black shank disease) and viral (TMV) pathogens. Therefore, Ta-JA1 has a broadened role in the plant defense response, which can act on general bacteria (E. coli) and harmful pathogens (wildfire, black shank and TMV pathogens). Inhibition of E. coli growth has been reported for a lectin that contains chitinase domain, BjCHI1 [46] . Transplastomic tobacco expressing BjCHI1 have also shown anti-fungal activities against different pathogens, including Colletotrichum truncatum, C. acutatum, Botrytis cinerea, and Ascochyta rabiei [47] . The actions of Ta-JA1 on disease resistance look similar with that of BjCHI1. Compared with specific disease resistant genes, the actions of Ta-JA1 on pathogens are not very strong, suggesting Ta-JA1 confers a basal but broad-spectrum resistance to pathogens. Ta-JA1 is the first Monocot JRL protein that has been shown to increase disease resistance. Considering Ta-JA1 as a jasmonate-regulated protein, which is in downstream of jasmonate-induced processes, Ta-JA1 may interact with microbes instead of inducing the other gene actions. In contrast, overexpression of an AP2/EREBP transcription factor, OPBP1, has been shown to enhance both disease resistance and salt tolerance of tobacco through regulating expression in sets of stress-related genes [31] . The mechanism of Ta-JA1 with microbes is interesting and warrants further investigation.",

            "text": "-JA1 together with other related proteins might form a new type of lectins, namely monocot jacalin-related lectins (Monocot JRL). Monocot JRLs have two features that are distinct from classical JRLs. (1) All Monocot JRLs are found in the Poaceae family. The evolutional analysis of Crs-1 indicated that Monocot JRL homologues were present in tribe Triticeae (barley and wheat), Oryzeae (rice), and Andropogoneae (maize and sorghum), while being lost in the Aveneae [40]. (2) Monocot JRL proteins contain two functional domains. A disease response domain is located in their N-termini, while a JRL domain is located in their C-termini, in contrast with the classical JRL proteins that just have a JRL domain. Hence, Monocot JRL proteins can be regarded as modular proteins composed of an N-terminal disease response domain followed by a JRL domain. Physiological functions of Monocot JRL proteins remain largely open to be investigated. Their insect resistant properties have been demonstrated by feeding Drosophila melanogaster larvae with TaHfr-1 protein, a similar Monocot JRL protein that can be induced by wheat Hessian fly",
