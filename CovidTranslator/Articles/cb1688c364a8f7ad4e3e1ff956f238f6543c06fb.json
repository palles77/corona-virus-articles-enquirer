As antigen for detection of SARS-CoV, the nucleocapsid protein (N) showed high sensitivity and strong reactivity with all samples from SARS-CoV patients and cross-reacted with all serum samples from healthy subjects, with either those obtained from China (10 samples) or those obtained from France (38 serum samples), giving then a significant rate of false positives. Specifically, our data indicated that the two subunits, S1 (residues 14 to 760) and S2 (residues 761 to 1190), resulted from the divided spike reacted with all samples from SARS-CoV patients and without any crossreactivity with any of the healthy serum samples. Consequently, these data revealed the nonspecific nature of N protein in serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV compared with the S1 and S2, where the specificity is of 100%. Moreover, the reported results indicated that the use of one single protein as a detection antigen of SARS-CoV infection may lead to false-positive diagnosis. These may be rectified by using more than one protein for the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV.",

However, this phenomenon of cleavage is not yet clear for the spike of SARS-CoV (10, 15) . The S protein is a main surface antigen, a factor of virulence, and a major neutralizing antigen capable of inducing protective immunity and eliciting immune responses during viral infection (3, 9, 10, 12, 24, 33, 34) . For the known coronaviruses, the spike protein is recognized by antibodies to SARS-CoV, and it is considered one of the candidate antigens for the detection of SARS-CoV, owing to its high antigenicity (11) .",

In this study, and by using Western blot assays, our results revealed that the S1 and S2 subunits of spike protein reacted only with confirmed positive serum samples and without any cross-reactivity with any of the healthy donors, which indicated that the S1 and S2 proteins are specific antigens for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV. The nucleocapsid protein has been reported to be a sensitive marker for the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV (8) . However, our results, while confirming its high sensitivity, also showed the nonspecific nature of this protein and indicated that the N protein reacted strongly to all healthy serum samples, giving a significant rate of false positives. In addition, the use of one single antigen for the detection or diagnosis of SARS-CoV gives limited information and might lead to false-positive results.

The three expression vectors pET21b-S1, pET21b-S2, and pET21b-N were separately transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Merck Eurolab, Fontenay Sous Bois, France). The transformed BL21(DE3) host cells were incubated for 6 to 8 h at 37\u00b0C in 4 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) medium broth (bioM\u00e9rieux, Lyon, France) containing 100 g/ml of ampicillin (Roche Diagnostics, Meylan, France) as an antibiotic. The cultures were then diluted 1:25 (vol/vol) in LB medium and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C under agitation (225 rpm). After overnight growth, the cultures were diluted with LB medium 1:50 (vol/vol), and after being shaken, the cells grew to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 to 0.8. For expression, IPTG (isopropyl-\u2424-D-thiogalactopyranoside) was added to a final concentration of 1 mM and then the bacteria were incubated at 37\u00b0C at 250 rpm for an additional 4 to 5 h, followed by centrifugation at 3,200 \u03eb g for 15 min to get the cell pellets. The pellets were suspended separately in 10 ml of 20 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 200 mM NaCl, 100 mM PMSF (paramethyl sulfonyl fluoride), 1 mM Benzonase, and 5 mM \u2424-mercaptoethanol, and lysed by sonication with an ultrasonic processor (Mi-sonix, Inc., Farmingdale, N.Y.). The resulting lysates were centrifuged at 10,400 \u03eb g for 13 min at 4\u00b0C. In addition, the pellets and the supernatants were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). All three recombinant proteins expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) mainly formed inclusion bodies and released limited soluble forms in the cytoplasm. Consequently, the recombinant proteins could not be purified directly from the soluble fractions. To obtain a high protein yield and to facilitate their purification, the bacterial pellets were treated separately with 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) containing 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM \u2424-mercaptoethanol, and 8 M urea for S1 and N and 6 M guanidine for S2, followed by a strong probe sonication to completely dissolve the inclusion bodies. After centrifugation at 10,400 \u03eb g for 13 min at 4\u00b0C, the supernatants were applied separately to Ni 2\u03e9 -NTA resin equilibrated with 5 volumes (5 ml/ml) of binding buffer (50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 /NaH 2 PO 4 , 300 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 5 mM \u2424-mercaptoethanol, and 8 M urea) (pH 8.0) at room temperature. For the three proteins, the columns were then washed successively with 10 volumes of binding buffer containing 20 mM imidazole. In the case of the polyhistidine-tagged S1 and S2 proteins, the elution was finally performed with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM imidazol, 300 mM NaCl, and 1 mM PMSF. However, the tagged N protein was eluted with sodium phosphate buffer (pH 4.0) containing 8 M urea.

The Western blot analysis was performed to verify the protein expressions and antigenicity and, principally, to test the sensitivity of the purified recombinant S1, S2, and N proteins to the human convalescent-phase serum samples with SARS-CoV. The recombinant proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, and the protein bands were then transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman, Gerbershausen, Germany). The membranes were subsequently blocked in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20, and 5% skim milk) and probed at room temperature for 1 h with rabbit anti-SARS-CoV polyclonal antibody or with anti-His-tagged monoclonal antibody raised in mouse. After being rinsed for 20 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, the bound antibodies were detected either with anti-rabbit or with anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase at a dilution of 1:10,000. The immunoprecipitated bands were developed by using a substrate mixture of O-dianisidine tetrazotized and beta-naphthyl acid phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France) in borate buffer (pH 9.5) or with horseradish peroxidaseconjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France) followed by chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences Europe GmbH, Orsay, France) and exposed to X-ray film for 1 to 3 min. To test the serum reactivities, the Western blot assay was performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory by using the purified His 6 -tagged recombinant S1, S2, and N proteins. After being loaded separately into each continuous well of 12% SDS-PAGE, the purified recombinant proteins were electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was cut into strips, and the strips were incubated separately with each of 78 serum samples diluted 1:1,500 for 5 h. The incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-human antibody (1:10,000) and the strips revelation were performed by following the protocol detailed above. In addition, another 38 negative serum samples were purchased from EFS (Etablissement fran\u00e7ais du sang, Lyon, France), corresponding to healthy French donors and collected 2 years before the outbreak of SARS.",

By comparing the reaction intensities of the two subunits of spike, we found that S1 showed a stronger immunoreactivity than S2. Therefore, some serum samples that reacted strongly to the S1 domain did not recognize or reacted weakly with the S2 domain. This may be due either to the antigenic dependence conformation of the S2 and S1 domains or to the high antigenicity of the S2 protein. These observations are consistent with previous findings that the full spike protein of SARS-CoV contains multiple linear immunodominant sites that are capable of inducing site-specific antibody responses during infection (10) . In addition, the S1 protein appears with six antigenic sites, whereas only two antigenic sites are located in S2 (8, 35) . Both S1 and S2 reacted with different convalescent-phase sera, and no reactivity was shown with any of healthy serum samples, which indicated that the S1 and S2 are specific antigens, in particular the S1 protein, owing to its reactivity to all positive sera (30 of 30 samples) and the existence of the major immunodominant epitope (residues 528 to 635 of S1), as proven by He and coworkers (10) . The comparison study of the reactivity of serum samples obtained from convalescent-phase patients against S1 and S2 may provide useful information for the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV and indicated that the S1 portion could be a primary and primordial target for the specific antibodies which could be induced abundantly and persist for a Table represents only the immunoreactive patterns shown by the confirmed convalescent-phase patients with SARS-CoV (30 serum samples). \u03e9\u03e9\u03e9, strong immunoreactivity; \u03e9\u03e9, moderate immunoreactivity; \u03e9, weak immunoreactivity; \u03ea, negative (no signal was observed).",

The entire spike protein is a major requirement for the induction of protective immunity, and this property is probably associated with S1, as is the case for other coronavirus strains such as infectious bronchitis virus (15, 18, 35) . These results strongly suggest that S1 is a specific antigen and could be the ideal marker for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection. The high sensitivity of N protein in detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV may be due to the abundance of IgG anti-N which is the first and most abundantly released immunoglobulin during the acute and convalescence phases of disease (22, 25) . In addition, the N protein is considered free of glycosylation; subsequently, its immunogenicity is not modified during expression in a prokaryotic system. On the other hand, spike is a major viral component protein with 24 glycosylation sites which may affect its immunological characteristics (31) . The analysis of Western blot assay based on recombinant N protein revealed that all healthy serum samples cross-reacted with N protein. Thus, we suspected that the cross-reactivity may be due to various factors. Among them, we can first highlight the serum origin (China). We supposed that the healthy donors from China could be in contact with SARS-infected patients or with people with SARS contact history. However, the use of serum samples obtained from healthy French donors who had never been in a risk area and were collected 2 years before the outbreak of SARS did not affect the profile reactivity and indicated that the N protein reacted to all healthy serum samples with moderate protein band intensities, such as that observed for SARS-CoV-related serum samples (Fig. 3) . Second, we suspected the high amount of antigen used to perform the Western blot analysis. However, when reducing the quantity of protein, we noted that the cross-reactivity with healthy serum samples still persists, independent of the quantity of protein used in the Western blot assay. Finally, we speculated about the integrity and the purity of the recombinant N protein. We supposed that the protein may be altered during the expression or purification process. However, mass spectrometry analysis (data not shown) indicated that the N protein was pure and corresponded to the mass of the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. The false-positive results with healthy donor serum samples may be explained as follows. First, there is serological cross-reactivity with other known coronaviruses such as human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Indeed, the nucleocapsid is the most conserved antigen among other structural proteins of coronaviruses (9, 32). Previous reports expected that the antibodies against these human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) are widespread in the human population, which could produce a cross-reactivity in SARS diagnosis (16) . Second, there is cross-reactivity with an eventual undetected pathogen or with human tissue antigens where N protein may share sequence homologies. Third, the positive reaction may be due not only to cross-reactivity with known coronaviruses or with other undetected pathogens but to the avidity of IgG to recombinant nonglycosylated protein, knowing well that the N protein is a nonglycosylated protein (29) .",

Moreover, the false-positive rate of the antibodies to N protein showed by immunoblot assay was significantly high, which might pose problems for serodiagnosis, epidemiological survey, and control of SARS-CoV. Thus, we suppose that the use of one single antigen, such as N protein, remains insufficient and does not appear to provide good and trustworthy diagnostic information. We suggest that, if it is necessary to use N recombinant protein to diagnose SARS-CoV infection, owing to its high sensitivity, it is important to identify the main immunoreactive N epitope instead the complete N protein, to obtain a better specificity. In addition, it is preferable to improve by using other SARS-CoV antigens, such as S1 and S2, as a suitable system for specific and sensitive serodiagnosis and epidemiological study of SARS-CoV. ",
