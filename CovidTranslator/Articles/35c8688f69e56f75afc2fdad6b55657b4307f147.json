Although it can be caused by a wide variety of micro-organisms, the pneumococcus, atypicals, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and certain Gram-negative rods are the usual pathogens encountered. The site-of-care decision is critical in determining the site and type of care as well as the extent of diagnostic workup. Antimicrobial therapy should be started as soon as possible particularly in those requiring admission to hospital, but typically the physician does not know with any degree of certainty the identity of the etiologic pathogen. A number of national guidelines have been published to help the physician with this choice. The initial drug(s) can be modified if necessary if the pathogen and its antimicrobial susceptibility pattern becomes known. Adjunctive therapy such as pressors and fluid replacement are of value and macrolides appear to help as well, likely secondary to their immunomodulatory effects. Recent data also suggest a role for steroids.",

Until recently, it was considered to be either community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or hospital-(and/or ventilator) acquired pneumonia (HAP/VAP). It was noted that there is a subgroup of outpatients who have had contact with the healthcare system and who present with pneumonias caused by organisms more similar to those causing HAP than CAP [1] . A new category of pneumonia called healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) was defined [2] . However, recent data have raised questions about whether the concerns regarding the types of pathogens and their resistance patterns in HCAP will in fact hold up [3, 4] . It is likely that this subgroup will be modified considerably.",

Anaerobic bacteria may be seen in cases of gross aspiration pneumonia in patients with unprotected airways (seizure, substance or alcohol abuse) and/or gingivitis. It is worth noting that S. pneumoniae seems to be decreasing in frequency with widespread use of pneumococcal vaccines and the atypical pathogens such as M. pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae are becoming more important particularly in young adults [13] . Other atypicals such as Legionella and a variety of viral pathogens can play a role as well. Generally, fungal and protozoal infections are not usually seen in the normal host with CAP except under specific circumstances such as coccidioidomycosis and cryptococcosis. PCR studies show that viral pathogens may be present in 20% of CAP patients, but whether they are etiologic agents, co-pathogens or simply colonizers cannot always be determined [14] .

It has been shown that for elderly CAP patients requiring hospitalization the overall mortality rate is greater than that of the general hospital population and this enhanced mortality extends out to 1 year [17] .

They are felt to take part in innate immunity, they can clear apoptotic cells and can bind non-self structures such as bacteria and fungi [20, 21] . If these defenses are also unsuccessful and the infection challenge persists then the inflammatory response of the patient comes into play and accounts ultimately for most of the signs and symptoms of pneumonia. If the pro-inflammatory cytokine response is excessive then the process may progress to sepsis, organ failure and possibly shock and even death. In cases of severe infection, various inflammatory mediators including IL-1, TNF, IL-8 and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor result in fever and the release of neutrophils and their attraction to the lung. An alveolar-capillary leak may develop resulting in filling of the alveoli and subsequent hypoxemia and findings of pneumonia on auscultation and on chest x-ray. If this process is severe, the secondary changes in lung volume and compliance may eventually result in the patient's demise [22, 23] .",

The two best known are the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) and CURB-65 [40, 41] . PSI was initially developed to identify CAP patients well enough to be treated in the community and the CURB-65 is a true severity of illness score. Both assign points to patients based on various criteria, but there the similarity ends. The PSI uses 20 variables and relegates patients to 1 of 5 categories, while CURB-65 uses only 5 variables and puts patients into 1 of 3 categories. Both have their pros and cons; although the CURB-65 is easier to use and both perform quite well for most patients, neither is particularly good for determining the need for ICU care.

Adjunctive therapy measures have been developed to help sustain the patient, for example, vasopressors, fluid replacement and attempts to modulate the host inflammatory response. A good example of success is the role played by macrolides. They have a number of immunomodulatory effects including alteration of cytokine expression, leukocyte function and apoptosis [69, 70] .
