            "text": "As an example, assume we want to develop an expert system that generates the probability a patient presenting to an emergency department (ED) has severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) given their free-text medical records. According to the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definitions of SARS, the required input variables for diagnosing SARS are whether the patient (1) has an acute respiratory finding (Respiratory Fx), (2) is febrile (Fever), (3) has an abnormal chest radiograph consistent with consolidation or pneumonia (CXR), and (4) has recently traveled to a country currently affected by SARS (Travel) . Values for the first three variables are often described in electronic textual patient records. Figure 17 .1 shows excerpts from a patient's medical record generated during an ED visit, including the triage chief complaint, history and physical exam, and chest radiograph report. A human physician reading these textual records could easily determine the correct values for the first three variables. Information from the fourth variable (Travel) may not be accessible anywhere in the patient's medical record unless the dictating physician had been concerned about SARS and had dictated the travel history. Retrieving the value for the Travel variable may require a semi-automatic technique in which patients with a high probability of SARS based on the three clinical values could be interviewed regarding their travel history. A simple expert system may only use the variable Respiratory Fx, monitoring the number of patients presenting to the ED with respiratory complaints. A physician may be able to determine the true value of the Respiratory Fx variable from information in the triage chief complaint. A more complex expert system may use all three variables. According to the medical record in Figure 17 .1, a physician would assign values to the variables in a more complex expert system as follows. Respiratory Fx: yes, because the patient had a chief complaint of cough, he complained to the ED physician of productive cough and shortness of breath,'and the shortness of breath was probably not cardiac in nature, given that the patient did not have a history of CHF and denied chest pain; Fever: yes, because the chief complaint and the ED report said the patient was febrile; and CXR: yes, because the radiograph report described an opacity consistent with pneumonia.",

Once a patient is examined by a physician, the patient's diagnosis may be recorded in a dictated report.

The sublanguage of patient medical records exhibits linguistic characteristics that influence an NLP system's ability to extract information from the text. When a physician reads a patient's medical reports, she understands the linguistic characteristics of the text and can make reasonable inferences from the record. For instance, a physician will not assign the Respiratory Fx a value of yes if the respiratory finding described in the report is described as occurring in the patient's past history. For an NLP application to determine the values of clinical variables from patient records the same way a physician would, the application must account for or model the linguistic characteristics of the clinical text. Some important linguistic characteristics of the sublanguage of patient reports are (1) linguistic variation, (2) polysemy, (3) negation, (4) contextual information, (5) finding validation, (6) implication, and (7) co-reference.",

Biomedical polysemy manifests itself in different ways (Roth and Hole, 2000, Liu et al., 2001) . Some words in clinical texts have different biomedical meanings or word senses. For instance, the word \"discharge\" has two word sensesmone word sense meaning a procedure for being released from the hospital, as in \"prior to discharge,\" and one word sense meaning a substance that is emitted from the body, as in \"purulent discharge.\" Acronyms and abbreviations with more than one meaning may be the most frequently occurring type of biomedical polysemy. A striking example of this is the acronym \"APC,\" which has more than thirty unique biomedical definitions, including activated protein c, adenomatosis polyposis coli, antigen-presenting cell, aerobic plate count, advanced pancreatic cancer, age period cohort, and alfalfa protein concentrated. According to one study (Wren and Garner, 2002) , 36 % of the acronyms in MEDLINE are associated with more than one definition. The number of unique acronyms in MEDLINE is increasing at the rate of 11,000 per year, and the number of definitions associated with unique acronyms is increasing at 44,000 per year. In the sublanguage of patient reports, the type of report is helpful in disambiguating the correct meaning of an acronym or abbreviation, because the report type indicates the type of medical specialty. In this way, \"APC\" in a microbiology lab report is more likely to mean aerobic plate count, whereas \"APC\" in a discharge summary may be referring to advanced pancreatic cancer.",

For this reason, understanding what is said in a dictated medical report is difficult for a human reader without domain knowledge. Researchers compared laypeople against physicians at reading chest radiograph reports and judging whether the report described radiological evidence of acute bacterial pneumonia (Fiszman et al., 1999) . Not surprisingly, laypeople performed much worse than physicians. As long as the report stated explicitly that the findings were consistent with pneumonia, the laypeople agreed with the physicians in their judgment, but pneumonia was mentioned in only one-third of the positive reports. In the remaining two-thirds of the reports, the evidence for pneumonia was inferred by the physicians and missed by the laypeople. Implication in medical reports can occur at the sentence level and at the report level. A simple example is the sentence, \"The patient had her influenza vaccine.\" If our SARS expert system had a variable for influenza, even a layperson reading the previous sentence could determine that the value for the variable would probably be no, because the patient was vaccinated. This inference requires domain knowledge that a vaccine generally prevents the target disease. In the radiology study reported above, evidence for pneumonia in positive reports was not always explicitly stated by the radiologist. Instead, the radiologist described \"hazy opacities\" or \"ill-defined densities\" in the lobes of the lung, which can be inferred to mean localized infiltrates. Once the inference at the sentence level has been correctly made, a physician reading the radiology report can integrate the findings described throughout the entire report and can infer that because the chest x-ray shows localized infiltrates not explained by other causes, there is evidence for acute bacterial pneumonia. Domain knowledge about words, combinations of words, and combinations of findings make it possible for a physician to make inferences from reports that a lay person--or an:expert system--may not be able to make without training in knowledge of the domain.",

For example, a text classification application may classify MEDLINE abstracts into one of many possible MeSH categories or may classify websites by topic. Various statistical models have been applied to the problem of text classification, including regression models, Bayesian belief networks, nearest neighbor algorithms, neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines. The basic element in all text classification algorithms is the frequency distribution of the words in the text. Applications of text classification of free-text patient medical records include retrieving records of interest to a specific research query , assigning ICD-9 admission diagnoses to chief complaints (Gundersen et al., 1996) , and retrieving medical images with specific abnormalities (Hersh et al., 2001) . In the domain of biosurveillance, text classification techniques have been applied to triage chief complaints and chest radiograph reports. CoCo (Olszewski, 2003) is a naive Bayesian text classification application that classifies free-text triage chief complaints into syndromic categories, such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, or neurological, based on the frequency distribution of the words in the chief complaints. For example, the chief complaint \"cough\" would be assigned a higher probability of being respiratory than of being gastrointestinal or neurological, because chief complaints in the training corpus that contained the word \"cough\" were classified most frequently as respiratory. The IPS system was used to create a query for retrieving chest radiograph reports describing mediastinal findings consistent with inhalational anthrax (Chapman et al., 2003) . The IPS system uses likelihood ratios to identify words that discriminate between relevant and not relevant documents.",

The most common parts of speech in English are noun (e.g., \"tuberculosis,\" \"heart\"), verb (e.g., \"see,\" \"prescribe\"), adjective (e.g., \"severe,\" \"red\"), adverb (e.g., \"quickly, .... carefully\"), determiner (e.g., \"the,\" \"some\"), preposition (e.g., \"of, .... in\"), participle (e.g., \"up,\" \"out\"), and conjunction (e.g., \"and,\" \"but\"). The difficulty in automatically assigning a part of speech to words in a sentence is that some words can have more than one part of speech. For example, the word \"discharge\" can be a verb or a noun. Automated part-of-speech taggers use either rules or probability distributions learned from hand-tagged training sets to assign parts of speech and perform with an accuracy of 96-97% on general English texts, such as newspaper articles, scientific journals, and books. Part-of-speech distribution in patient reports is different than that of nonclinical texts. For example, discharge summaries contain more nouns and past tense verbs and fewer proper nouns (e.g., people and company names) and present tense verbs (Campbell and Johnson, 2001) . Not surprisingly, training a part-of-speech tagger on medical texts improves its accuracy when assigning parts of speech to patient reports (Campbell and Johnson, 2001, Coden et al., 2005) . Publicly available part-of-speech taggers trained on medical documents are just beginning to become available (Smith et al., 2004) .",

Automated parsers employ a grammar consisting of rules or probability distributions for generating combinations of words and a lexicon listing the possible parts of speech for the words. Automated parsers may attempt to produce a deep parse that connects all the words and phrases together into a sentence (Figure 17.2[a] ) or a partial parse (also called a shallow parse), which combines words into noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases but does not attempt to link the phrases together ( Figure 17.2[b] ).

The syntactic parse helps determine which words in the sentence should be slotted together into the Bayesian network (i.e., which words are syntactically related). When a new phrase or sentence is slotted into the network, MPLUS can make inferences about the meaning of the words in a sentence in spite of the different combinations of words that can be used to describe the same concept. For example, the phrases \"hazy opacity in the left lower lobe\" and \"ill-defined densities in the lower lobes\" both indicate localized infiltrates-even though the word \"infiltrate\" was not used by the radiologist.",

For instance, ED reports may contain sections for chief complaint, past history, history of present illness, physical exam, radiologic or lab findings, hospital course, discharge diagnosis, and plan. The section in which a finding is described can provide information important to understanding the meaning of the report. For example, our SARS detector may have a variable for pneumonia history, a variable for radiological evidence of pneumonia, and a variable for a pneumonia diagnosis. An instance of pneumonia described in the radiological findings section of a report is likely to provide radiological evidence of pneumonia, whereas an instance of pneumonia in the discharge diagnosis section probably indicates a diagnosis. Report section identification can also assist in understanding whether the finding occurred in the past history, the current visit, or as a hypothetical finding (e.g., a finding described in the plan section is more likely to be a hypothetical finding), can identify findings for family members (e.g., a finding in the social history section may not be the patient's finding), and can provide insight regarding the anatomic location of an ambiguous finding (e.g., a mass described in the radiology finding section is probably a pulmonary mass). Patient reports tell a story involving various findings, physicians, patients, family members, medications, and treatments that are often referred to more than once in the text. Identifying which expressions are really referring to the same entity is important in integrating information about that entity. Useful discourse clues for identifying coreferring expressions include how close the expressions are within the text (e.g., a referring expression is more likely to refer to a referent in the previous sentence than to a referent five sentences back), overlapping words (e.g. \"the pain\" is more likely to refer to \"chest pain\" than to \"atelectasis\"), and the semantic type of the entities (e.g., \"she\" can only refer to a human entity, not to a finding or disease).",

Diagnostic models are also helpful for determining the values of individual variables. For example, a Bayesian network can model which radiological findings occur with which diseases.

The fever study also measured the case detection accuracy of fever diagnosis from chief complaints and ED reports. The NLP application for identifying fever in chief complaints performed with perfect sensitivity and specificity in the feature detection evaluation. However, when quantifying how well the automatically extracted variable of fever from chief complaints identified patients who had a true fever based on reference standard judgment from the ED report, the chief complaint fever detector only performed with a sensitivity of 61%. The specificity remained at 100%. On the one hand, whenever a chief complaint mentioned fever, the patient actually had a fever, so there were no falsepositive diagnoses from chief complaints. On the other hand, despite the fact that the NLP technology did not make any mistakes in determining if fever was described in a chief complaint, the chief complaints themselves did not always mention fever when the patient was febrile in the ED. As demonstrated by this study, coupling evaluations on feature detection with evaluations on case detection can inform us about the source of diagnostic errors, which could be the NLP technology, the input data itself, or a combination of the two.",

Evaluating epidemic detection is difficult. The first requirement for an epidemic detection study is reference standard identification of an outbreak. Outbreaks of respiratory and GI illnesses, such as influenza, pneumonia, and gastroenteritis, occur yearly throughout the country. Outbreaks of other infectious or otherwise concerning diseases, such as anthrax, West Nile virus, hemorrhagic fever, or SARS, rarely occur in the United States.

Outcome measures were reported for correlation between chief complaint classifications and ICD-9 classifications and for timeliness of detection. Figure 17 .7 from the Ivanov publication shows the time series plot of respiratory illness admissions (reference standard) and chief complaints. It is evident from the plot that chief complaints generated the same type of signal that the reference standard generated. Chief complaint classification detected three respiratory outbreaks with 100% sensitivity and specificity, and time series of chief complaints correlated with hospital admissions and preceded them by an average of 10.3 days.",

Regardless of the type of free-text data, we suggest three questions to consider when deciding whether application of NLP techniques to textual data is feasible for disease and outbreak detection: (1) How complex is the text? The simple phrases in chief complaints are much easier to understand than complex discourses contained in ED reports. Textual data that require coreference resolution, domain modeling for inference, and other more difficult techniques required to identify values for the variables of interest will be more challenging to process and will be more prone to error. (2) What is the goal of the NLP technique? If the goal is to understand all temporal, anatomic, and diagnostic relations described in the text as well as a physician could, you may be in for a lifetime of hard but interesting work. Extraction of a single variable, such as fever, or encoding temporal, anatomic, and diagnostic relations for a finite set of findings, such as all respiratory findings, is more feasible. (3) Can the detection algorithms that will use the variables extracted with NLP handle noise? Detecting small outbreaks requires more accuracy in the input variables.",

If the NLP-based expert system did not correctly detect that case, then the detection system would have failed. However, in detecting an outbreak of a gastrointestinal illness, for example, if the NLP-based expert system only detected two-thirds of the true cases, there may still be enough positive patients to detect a moderate to large-sized outbreak. In addition, the consistent stream of false positive cases identified by the NLP-based expert system would comprise a noisy baseline that may not prevent the algorithm from detecting a significant increase in gastrointestinal cases but would require a larger increase to detect the outbreak. Consideration of these three questions can help determine the feasibility of using NLP for outbreak and disease surveillance.",

However, because many of the variables helpful in biosurveillance do not require complete understanding of the text, NLP techniques may successfully extract variables useful for outbreak detection. In fact, evaluations of feature detection, case detection, and epidemic detection of NLP techniques have begun to demonstrate the utility of NLP techniques in this new field. More research in NLP techniques and more evaluation studies of the effectiveness of NLP will not only increase our understanding of how to extract information from text but will also help us continue to learn what types of data provide the most timely and accurate information for detecting outbreaks.",
