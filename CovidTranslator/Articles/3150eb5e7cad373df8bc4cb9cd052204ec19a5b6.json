Deficiencies in the complement cascade are known to be associated with increased infection rate, poor outcome in patients with sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and autoinflammatory diseases [2] [3] [4] ; features often seen in ALF. In studies of ALF in mice, the complement system is activated with increased liver-deposition of complement proteins, which correlate with liver damage. Additionally, complement protein knockout mice experience reduced liver injury in experimental ALF [5, 6] . The current literature thus points to a possible deleterious role of complement in ALF.",

In other inflammatory diseases, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis the lectin pathway contributes to the pathogenesis [8] . The lectin pathway is initiated by soluble pattern recognition proteins, i.e., MBL, M-, L-, and H-ficolin and collectin-liver-1 (CL-L1), which recognize different patterns of carbohydrate or acetyl-group containing ligands on pathogens and necrotic or apoptotic cells. The collectins and ficolins circulate in the blood; when they recognize their respective ligands, a proteolytic cleavage of complement proteins is initiated, thereby facilitating phagocytosis and cell lysis by complement activation [9] .",

Of the 75 patients 7 patients died within the first 3 days. In total 51 patients died or were transplanted during the entire study period. Serum samples were stored in a biobank at \u221280 \u00b0C. Local on-site investigators using standard criteria recorded the aetiology of ALF. In addition, 75 healthy blood donors were included as controls. 20 patients with stable alcoholic liver cirrhosis were recruited at routine visits from the outpatient clinics to study the lectin pathway proteins in a setting of chronic liver disease. They had no signs of acute decompensation or infection. The diagnosis of alcoholic cirrhosis was based on relevant alcohol intake, the presence of a bulky liver surface detected by ultrasound or CT or the presence of signs of portal hypertension, or liver biopsy. Clinical and biochemical data are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2 . The study met all requirements of and was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at the respective study sites according to the US ALF study group protocol. Central Denmark Region Committees on Health Research Ethics approved the study regarding the healthy controls and alcoholic cirrhosis patients.",

The most likely mechanism is that the proteins are released from cells due to different stimuli. MBL is most likely to be released upon production whereas CL-L1 unlike MBL and the ficolins, is a cytosolic protein stored in secretory granules in hepatocytes [23] . CL-L1 may, therefore, be shed into the bloodstream when the hepatocytes undergo necrosis or apoptosis during ALF. This may explain why CL-L1 levels are higher in ALF patients than healthy controls, contrary to MBL and the ficolins. Previous studies have shown decreased levels of complement proteins due to deposition in the liver, which may explain the low levels of MBL and M-ficolin [5, 6] . Therefore, the function of MBL may remain intact in patients with higher levels of MBL causing the association of high levels of MBL to be related to survival in ALF.",

Patients who experienced spontaneous survival had higher levels of MBL and lower levels of L-ficolin, indicating that the changes in the lectin pathway proteins may in fact be part of the disease process or a product of the changes in the liver status during the disease course. All though we observe associations with survival these results cannot clearly help determine who will survive because of the overlap between groups. Future studies should investigate MBL genotypes to explain effects of MBL polymorphisms as a prognostic factor for survival. Donor and recipient genotypes and levels of MBL seem to be a prognostic factor for infections and survival in liver transplantation [32] . This is the first published study on CL-L1 in acute and chronic liver diseases and compared with healthy controls. CL-L1 is a newly described protein speculated to activate the lectin pathway in a manner similar to MBL. CL-L1 levels are inversely correlated to ALT that normally is considered to reflect hepatocyte damage, while the CL-L1 levels are positively correlated to bilirubin secretion. This leads to the idea that elevated CL-L1 levels reflect a more prolonged damage to the liver, which is also consistent with the fact that CL-L1 correlates with both the duration of symptoms and icterus. An interesting observation is the low level of CL-L1 in acetaminophen induced ALF.",
