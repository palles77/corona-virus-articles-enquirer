            "text": "The genomic relationship ofporcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) to bovine coronavirus (BCV) and human coronavirus (HCV) strain OC43 was examined by dot blot hybridization assays. Two BCV S gene-specific probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction from the avirulent Lg-strain of BCV. Probes were located in the S1 and the $2 region of the peplomeric (S) glycoprotein gene. The S 1 probe (726 bp) hybridized with BCV and HCV-OC43, but not with HEV under moderate stringency hybridization conditions (50 \u00b0C). Only slight signals were present with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and no signals were observed with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) or canine coronavirus (CCV). At high stringency conditions (60 \u00b0C) the S1 probe hybridized with BCV only. Using the $2 probe (680 bp) under moderate strin-gency conditions, hybridization signals were obtained with BCV, HCV-OC43 and HEV (strains 67N, NT9, VW572). The signals obtained by the three HEV strains were altogether weaker than with BCV and HCV-OC43. The $2 probe did not react with MHV, FIPV and CCV. At high stringency the S2-specific probe hybridized with BCV and HCV-OC43 but did not hybridize with HEV. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the region covering the S2 probe in HEV revealed 92.6% nucleotide sequence homology to BCV and 91.9% to HCV-OC43. In contrast, the region covering the S1 probe in HEV could not be amplified using the BCV S 1-specific primers. The hybridization and sequencing results thus indicate a closer genomic relationship between BCV and HCV-OC43 than there is between HEV and BCV or HCV-OC43, respectively.",
