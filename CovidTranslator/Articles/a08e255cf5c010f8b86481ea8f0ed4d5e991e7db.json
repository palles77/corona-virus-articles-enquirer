However, working with and in these equipment for a long time is exhausting, for example, when wearing a N95 mask nurses needed to speaking loudly to make sure patients could hear. Some of the nurses' skins and facial features were temporarily disfigured because of wearing N95 masks for a long time. They wore diapers and tried their best to have less food and water while working in order to save PPE supplies. Many nurses cut their long hair and even shaved their heads to reduce the risk of contamination between patients and between themselves and the patient.",

A lot of nurses joined in to develop and open new wards in this arrangement. One nurse said they had only six hours to prepare 94 wards. They had to make sure the wards were comfortable and tidy as well as prepare many other things for patients, like instruments and equipment, furniture, bedding and articles of daily use. In order to finish the tasks the nurse shared that he walked 50,000 steps in 1 day. Another female nurse who was responsible for disposal of medical waste had to walk upstairs and downstairs dozens of times every day to transport of medical waste because it is forbidden to use the elevators to transport medical waste. Once she was too tired and fainted on the way to the warehouse, but fortunately a colleague was passing by and rescued her.",

As of February 29, 2020, a total of 79,824 cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported in mainland China, with 2,870 death cases and 41,625 cases of patients cured and discharged from hospital. There still remained 35,329 confirmed cases (including 7,365 in serious condition) and 851 suspected cases (National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020). Since the outbreak of the Covid-19, in order to race against time to treat patients, many medical workers from all over the country went to Hubei province to join battle against virus. More than 42,000 medical workers, including 28,600 nurses across China had been sent to Hubei province date to February 29, 2020 (THE STATE COUNCIL THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, 2020). A retrospective analysis showed that patients had 5%) and invasive ventilation therapy (2.18%) (Special Expert Group for Control of the Epidemic of Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia of the Chinese Preventive Medicine Association, 2020). Much of the work with these patients who have to be cared for is done by nurses. Nurses should not only do therapeutic work for patients, but also life care, basic care and psychosocial care. So it is very big challenge for nurses to fight this virus.",
