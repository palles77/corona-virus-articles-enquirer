Objectives: To rapidly and accurately quantify and subtype RSV in respiratory samples, we developed and evaluated two real-time RT-PCR assays. Study design: A quantitative assay was designed using primers for a consensus region of the matrix protein gene and a subtype-specific assay for RSV-A and RSV-B detection was designed using primers for the polymerase gene. Quantitative RSV RT-PCR results of pediatric nasal wash samples submitted to the University of Washington Virology Laboratory from December 2002, through May 2003, were compared to those of an indirect fluorescent antibody RSV antigen detection assay (FA). Results: Specificity of the RT-PCR assay was high, with no amplification of eleven common respiratory viruses and eight herpes viruses. Among 751 samples, RSV was detected in 267 (35.6%) by FA and in 286 (38.1%) by RT-PCR. Median RSV copy number in nasal wash samples that were positive by both FA and RT-PCR was 2.5 \u00d7 10 7 copies/mL versus a median of 3.0 \u00d7 10 4 copies/mL for samples positive by RT-PCR only (P < 0.001). The detection and quantity of RSV in respiratory specimens was associated with younger age, but not with gender or hospitalization. Among positive samples from this Seattle cohort, 52% were subtype A and 48% were subtype B. Both subtypes were detected with similar viral loads among all patient groups (stratified by age, gender, and hospitalization), and throughout the specimen collection period. Conclusions: These real-time RT-PCR assays provide a rapid, specific, and highly sensitive alternative for detecting, quantifying, and subtyping RSV in clinical specimens.",

Culture tests are labor intensive, technically challenging, and time consuming. Furthermore, both culture and antigen detection assays may lack sensitivity, especially for samples from adult patients (Falsey et al., 1996) . Reverse transcription (RT) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification assays that detect RSV RNA and distinguish between subtypes have been developed (Abels et al., 2001; Tang et al., 1999) . Because they do not require viable virus or intact cells, RT-PCR for RSV has been shown to be more sensitive than conventional methods for RSV detection in clinical samples from both children and adults (Erdman et al., 2003; van Elden et al., 2002) . Real-time PCR technology has been used not only to rapidly detect but also to quantify the amount of RSV in a sample (Gueudin et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2003; van Elden et al., 2003) .",

Several features combine to make this a unique assay, including consensus primers targeting the RSV matrix gene, reverse transcription and PCR in a one-step reaction, absolute quantification based on an RNA standard curve, and amplification of a control molecule multiplexed with the RSV reaction. Typing of the RSV positive specimens was performed with a second real-time RT-PCR assay that used primers to the RSV polymerase gene and two type-specific probes labeled with different fluorescent reporter dyes. Absolute quantification of RSV was achieved using standard curves that were generated with negative sense RNA transcripts of the RSV PCR amplicons, providing targets for reverse transcription and amplification that were similar to the RSV genomic RNA present in the clinical specimens. Although the one-step RT-PCR reaction could detect as few as 10 viral RNA copies, the lower limit of sensitivity for clinical specimens (1000 RSV copies/mL) was affected by the amount of respiratory specimen that could be added to a reaction (10 l) without producing inhibition. An external control RNA (EXO) was added to each specimen prior to RNA extraction and amplified using primers and probe included in the RSV reaction to prevent false negative RSV results due to poor RNA extraction or to inhibitors of the RT-PCR reaction. Initially low EXO amplification prompted repeat testing of 12.7% of the RSV negative specimens. One sample was subsequently eliminated from analysis due to lack of amplification and two additional RSV positive specimens were identified among the 58 samples that became satisfactory for EXO amplification on repeat testing. Simultaneous amplification of the external control in the RSV reaction provides greater confidence that the negative specimens are truly negative for RSV RNA.",

Fifty percent of the 28 samples with fewer than 10 5 RSV copies/mL were FA negative, suggesting a lower limit of sensitivity for FA in this range. All 21 discrepant RT-PCR positive samples were again positive when retested with the quantitative assay and also with the RSV type specific RT-PCR assay, providing evidence that these were not false positive results.

(2003) who used quantitative real-time PCR assays to detect RSV type A only, and types A and B, respectively, in pediatric respiratory specimens. In contrast, other investigators, using tissue cell cultures to quantify the virus, detected approximately 100-fold lower titers of RSV in specimens from children than are apparent by PCR (Buckingham et al., 2000; DeVincenzo et al., 2003; Englund et al., 1996; Hall et al., 1976; Wright et al., 2002) . RSV subtypes A and B were detected with equal frequency in our study. In contrast, the ratio of RSV subtypes detected has varied greatly among different populations tested as reported by others. The proportion of RSV positive samples that were subtype A has ranged from 15 to 100%, with type A samples more prevalent in most years (Freymuth et al., 1991; Hall et al., 1990; Hu et al., 2003; Kehl et al., 2001; Ong et al., 2001; Tang et al., 1999; Walsh et al., 1997; Whiley et al., 2002) .

            "text": "This quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay provides a rapid, specific, reliable, and highly sensitive diagnostic tool for investigating RSV in clinical specimens. It offers several advantages over viral culture including its potential for high throughput processing, objective endpoint, simpler specimen handling requirements, and ability to quantify a wide range of viral loads. Advantages over FA include increased sensitivity and the objective endpoint. Although the time required to process and test small numbers of samples is similar for both real-time RT-PCR and FA (approximately 4 h to complete 10 specimens), analysis of larger numbers of specimens is more quickly accomplished using RT-PCR because as many as 40 clinical samples can be simultaneously amplified in a 96-well reaction plate, while slides for FA must be read individually. However, the per specimen cost of reagents and supplies required for the RT-PCR assays is about three times higher than for FA and the cost of equipment for the real-time PCR assays is about four times higher than for FA (PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System versus fluorescent microscope).",

            "text": "The sensitivity of RT-PCR will be especially useful for detection of RSV in specimens from adults, which reportedly contain about 100 to 1000-fold less RSV than specimens from children (DeVincenzo et al., 2003; Englund et al., 1996; van Elden et al., 2003) . The diagnostic value of knowing an individual's RSV viral load or subtype is unclear. Some studies suggest that viral load (Buckingham et al., 2000; Hall et al., 1976) and RSV subtype (Hall et al., 1990; Walsh et al., 1997) are associated with severity of illness, while others report no associations (Gueudin et al., 2003; Martinello et al., 2002; Wright et al., 2002) . Combined with the RSV subtyping assay, the quantitative assay described here will provide information to better understand the relationship between illness severity and the quantity and subtype of virus being shed.",
