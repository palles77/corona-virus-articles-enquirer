            "text": "Caveolae, the major source of caveolin-1 protein, are specialized invaginated microdomains of the plasma membrane that act as organizing centers for signaling molecules in the immune system. In the present study, we report the cloning and characterization of caveolin-1 (mCav-1) from mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi) and study on the roles of mCav-1 in the fish Jak-Stat signaling pathway and in virus infection. The cDNA sequence of mCav-1 was 707 bp in size, encoding a protein of 181 amino acids, which was different from the mammalian protein (178 amino acids). The deduced amino acid sequence of mCav-1 shared similar architecture with vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins, but mCav-1 lacked a phosphorylation site (y14). The major subcellular location of mCav-1 was in the caveolae, where the protein appeared to have major functions. Real-time PCR revealed that the expression of the mandarin fish Mx, IRF-1, SOCS1, and SOCS3 genes involved in the poly(I:C)-induced Jak-Stat signaling pathway was impaired by the mCav-1 scaffolding domain peptide (mSDP). In mandarin fish fry (MFF-1) cells, the protein levels of mCav-1 were markedly up-regulated at 12 and 24 h post-infection with ISKNV (infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus). In addition, ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells was significantly inhibited by mSDP, and the inhibition was dose-dependent. Thus, ISKNV infection was apparently associated with mCav-1 protein and may utilize the caveolae-related endocytosis pathway. The findings reported here further our understanding of the function of caveolin-1 in the complex signal transduction network in fish immune systems and in the cellular entry mechanism of iridoviruses.",

            "text": "The caveolins are a family of 21-24 kDa integral membrane proteins that bind cholesterol and fatty acids and that also maintain the structure of caveolae (Ikonen and Parton, 2000) . Three members of the caveolin family have been identified to date: caveolin-1 (Cav-1, previously named VIP-21), caveolin-2 (Cav-2), and caveolin-3 (Cav-3, previously named M-caveolin) (Williams and Lisanti, 2004; Way and Parton, 1996) . Caveolin-1 was first identified as a principal protein component of caveolae membranes (Kurzchalia et al., 1992) . Subsequently, caveolin-1 was found highly expressed in cells with abundant caveolae and caveolin-1 expression was also found necessary or sufficient to generate caveolae membranes (Kim et al., 2006) . Caveolin-1 directly binds to cholesterol, employing the \"cholesterol recognition amino acid consensus\" sequence composed of residues 95-101 in the caveolin scaffolding domain (CSD). The cholesterol-binding capacity of caveolin-1 plays a key role in maintaining a stable balance of intracellular cholesterol, allowing caveolin-1 to act as a transporter that directs cholesterol efflux, selective uptake, and the delivery of newly synthesized cholesterol to the plasma membrane (Fielding, 2006) . The membrane binding and lipid raft interactions of synthetic peptides derived from the CSD of the caveolin-1 protein (caveolin-1 scaffolding domain peptide, SDP) have been investigated (Horton et al., 2006; Benferhat et al., 2008) .",

It is thought to function as a scaffolding protein that organizes and concentrates cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, and caveolaeassociated signaling molecules, such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase, H-ras, Src-like kinase, G proteins, Janus kinase (Jak), and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) proteins, among others (Couet et al., 1997; Ju et al., 1997; Harris et al., 2002; Schutzer et al., 2005; Baran et al., 2007; Elsasser et al., 2007; Rath et al., 2009) . Caveolae are known to act as organizing centers for immune-related signal transduction pathways, such as the Jak-Stat signaling pathway or the NFB-IB signaling pathway, etc. (Harris et al., 2002; Garrean et al., 2006) . In mammals, the Jak-Stat signaling pathway functions in host defense against viral and bacterial infections (Lad et al., 2005; Haller and Weber, 2009 ). The Jak-Stat signal transduction pathway is activated by a large number of cytokines and growth factors, including interferon (IFN)-\u2423/\u2424, IFN-\u2425, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and growth hormone (GH), among others (Imada and Leonard, 2000; Levy and Darnell, 2002; Gao, 2005; Chelbi-Alix and Wietzerbin, 2007; Sarasin-Filipowicz et al., 2009) . In mammalian cells, caveolin-1 protein has been reported to inhibit the Jak-Stat signaling pathway through direct interaction with Stat3 protein (Shah et al., 2002) .",

The suspension was subjected to 10-15 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 \u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C to remove nuclei. Clarified postnuclear supernatants were combined with 90% (w/v) sucrose prepared in MBS, transferred to the bottom of a Beckman 12.5-ml ultracentrifuge tube, and overlaid gently with 6 ml of 35% and 3 ml of 5% sucrose, respectively. The resulting 5-40% discontinuous sucrose gradients were centrifuged for 18-20 h at 39,000 \u00d7 g in a SW41 Beckman rotor at 4 \u2022 C in order to allow the separation of caveolae.",

The complete sequence of mCav-1 cDNA was 707 bp and contained a 5 -UTR of 49 bp, followed by an open reading frame (ORF) of 546 bp encoding a predicted protein of 181 amino acid residues and a 3 -UTR of 112 bp, including 23 nucleotides of the polyadenylation tail. The full-length sequence of mCav-1 was deposited in GenBank under accession no. FJ695596, and the deduced amino acid sequence was determined (Fig. 1A) . Two potential translation start sites were observed within the N terminus of the mCav-1 gene, which indicated mCav-1 might occur as two isoforms (\u2423-and \u2424-isoforms). The SMART program results showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of mCav-1 shared similar architecture of vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins, but mCav-1 lacked a phosphorylation site (y14). Multiple amino acid alignments of mCav-1 with other known vertebrate caveolin-1 molecules revealed a significant homology with the other known caveolin-1 sequences present in the database. Bioinformation analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of the mCav-1 share a similar architecture with vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins, including a N-end region, a signature motif (FEDVIAEP), a caveolin scaffolding domain, and a C-end region (Fig. 1B) . The mCav-1 had highest amino acid identity (above 90%) and similarity (above 95%) with caveolin-1 proteins from zebrafish (Danio rerio), pufferfish (Tetraodon nigroviridis), and fugu (Takifugu rubripes) compared with other vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins.",

The anti-mCav-1 antiserum used in our work was generated in New Zealand white rabbits by immunization with purified MBP-mCav-1 fusion protein. Fluorescence microscopy showed mCav-1 (red fluorescence) to be located in the plasma membrane and cytoplasm with dot distribution in MFF-1 cells, whereas mCav-1 was not observed in the nucleus (blue fluorescence) ( Fig. 2A) . A detergent-free method for preparing cholesterol-enriched fractions from MFF-1 cells was used. Cave-olae are resistant to nonionic detergents and could be extracted by ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient followed by 1% Triton X-100 treatment (Beer et al., 2005) . The detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) that are buoyant on low-density sucrose gradients have unique caveolae enriched with cholesterol, glycolipids, and caveolin proteins. Equal volume fractions of DRM and detergentsoluble membranes (DSMs) were separated by gel electrophoresis and subjected to Western blotting using anti-mCav-1 antiserum. As shown in Fig. 2B , mCav-1 protein was detected in the DRM (Fig. 2B , lanes 4-9) but was absent in the DSM (Fig. 2B, lanes 10-12) . These results were consistent with the typical distribution of caveolin-1 in mammalian cells (Parkin et al., 1996) . M\u2424CD, fillipin III, or nystatin (which deplete or sequester membrane cholesterol) is employed to disrupt the caveolae structure (Foster et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2008 Lee et al., , 2009 . As shown in Fig. 2C , the distribution of mCav-1 was altered and enriched in the DSM fractions (Fig. 2C, lanes 10-12) when cells were treated with M\u2424CD, filipin III, or nystatin, whereas in cells not treated with drugs, mCav-1 was found primarily in the DRM (Fig. 2C, lanes 4-9) . In addition, the electron micrographs show typical membrane invaginations found at the plasma membrane of MFF-1 cells (Fig. 2D, arrows) .

On a tissue weight basis, the levels of the \u2423-isoform were generally higher than the levels of the \u2424-isoform in fat tissue, heart, gills, and skeletal muscle. Consistent with the large numbers of invaginated caveolae in other vertebrate tissues, mCav-1 was prevalent in smooth muscle (e.g., intestine) and adipocytes (e.g., fat tissues). High levels of mCav-1 protein were also expressed in heart tissue, which appeared to contain as much as skeletal muscle. The highest level of mCav-1 was in the spleen, which, interestingly, is not considered to have large numbers of caveolae (Frank et al., 2009) . The spleen, however, is an important immune organ of mandarin fish and was also the major target tissue for ISKNV (He et al., 2001) , which suggested that mCav-1 might be involved in immune function.",

As shown in Fig. 4 , the mMx, mIRF-1, mSOCS1, and mSOCS3 genes were significantly induced by poly(I:C) post-stimulation of MFF-1 cells (Fig. 4 , black columns, as positive controls), compared to the untreated controls (0 h).

For instance, expression of the mMx gene was markedly increased \u223c350-fold by treatment of the cells with poly(I:C) for 8-12 h, compared to the untreated controls (0 h), while the expression of the mMx gene was increased \u223c180-fold and noticeably decreased by treatment of the cells with poly(I:C) and mSDP (p < 0.01).

The same amounts of total protein were separated by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-mCav-1 antiserum. Endogenous \u2424-tubulin was included as an internal loading control for the Western blots, using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against \u2424-tubulin (Epitomic Inc.). As shown in Fig. 5A , the mCav-1 protein was detected in all samples, and the levels of mCav-1 protein showed no obvious variation at 1-8 h after infection with virus when compared to uninfected (mock) samples. However, the mCav-1 protein levels were clearly up-regulated at 12 h and 24 h after virus infection. The densitometric analysis of mCav-1 expressions showed that the mCav-1 protein was significantly increased at 12 h (\u223c2.8-folds, p < 0.05) and 24 h (\u223c4.6-folds, p < 0.01) after ISKNV infection (Fig. 5B) .

The relative expression of each gene was determined by real-time PCR. \u2424-Actin was amplified from the same RNA samples as a control.

The entry of ISKNV into MFF-1 cells and its potential association with mCav-1 were examined in cells treated with mSDP and then infected with ISKNV virus. Infections were scored by measuring expression of the ISKNV membrane protein ORF101L using immunofluorescence staining. As shown in Fig. 6A , mSDP concentrations higher than 1 M significantly inhibited ISKNV entry into cells and the inhibition was dose-dependent. Treatment with 5, 10, 20, and 30 M mSDP significantly inhibited ISKNV infection by 75, 90, 95, and 98%, respectively, compared to the untreated control (0 M mSDP). Similar inhibitory effects were also observed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 6B , the ORF101L protein levels were significantly reduced when cells were treated with 5, 10, and 25 M mSDP, compared to the untreated control (0 M). The expression of ORF101L was almost undetectable when cells were treated with 25 M mSDP.

Bioinformatics analysis showed that the deduced amino acid sequences of mCav-1 shared a similar architecture with vertebrate caveolin-1 proteins and had a high identity score with the caveolin-1 from zebrafish, fugu, and pufferfish. In mammals, Tyr14 phosphorylation has emerged recently as a major switch that controls caveolin-1 physiological function in response to extracellular signal molecules and cell stressors such as insulin, IGF-I, EGF, VEGF, PDGF, IL-6, oxidants, hyperosmolarity, and UV irradiation, among others (Fielding, 2006) .

The cytotoxicity of mSDP was evaluated using the (CCK-8). MFF-1 cells were plated in a 96-well plate and incubated at 27 \u2022 C for 24 h, at which point the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations of mSDP incubated at 27 \u2022 C for an additional 6 h. CCK-8 solution was added to each well, and cells were incubated for 1 h.

Lane \"+\" indicates the control cells untreated with mSDP, and lane \"\u2212\" indicates the negative controls without ISKNV infection. The concentrations of mSDP are indicated. that distinguished the caveolin-1 proteins from mandarin fish from those of zebrafish and humans was that caveolin-1 proteins from mandarin fish, fugu, and pufferfish lacked a Tyr-14 residue (Fig. 1B) . In addition, we also found that caveolin-1 proteins from mandarin fish, fugu, and pufferfish lacked a reduced Tyr within the first 1-25 amino acids. This indicated that caveolin-1 protein from these three fish did not undergo Tyr14 phosphorylation. Further research is needed to determine whether mCav-1 has mechanisms other than the Tyr14 phosphorylation typical of zebrafish and mammalian caveolin-1 to activate associated-signal events. Our findings may provide a better understanding of the evolution of caveolaeassociated molecules and signaling pathways in fish.",

Caveolae act as organizing centers for signaling molecules in the immune system (Harris et al., 2002) , such as the Jak-Stat signal transduction pathway. The important signal molecules of this pathway, the Jak and Stat proteins, have been found in caveolae and directly interact with caveolin-1 protein to inhibit the Jak-Stat signaling pathway (Ju et al., 2000; Park et al., 2002; Shah et al., 2002; Jasmin et al., 2006a) .

The coupling of molecules to a 16-amino-acid peptide corresponding to the homeodomain of the Drosophila transcription factor Antennapedia (AP) is well known to facilitate their uptake into cultured mammalian cells through a non-endocytosis pathway (Perkins et al., 1988; Ou et al., 2003; Jasmin et al., 2006b) . Accordingly, coupling of the Cav-1 scaffolding domain to the AP peptide (Cav-1 SDP) was recently shown to facilitate its translocation across the cell membranes and to inhibit signal transduction pathways (Song et al., 2007) . Our current results showed that the poly(I:C)-induced Jak-Stat signal transduction pathway strongly induced the expression of Mx, IRF-1, SOCS1, and SOCS3 genes in MFF-1 cells (Fig. 4) , which was consistent with previously reported observations (Guo et al., 2009 ). However, this enhanced gene expression was significantly impaired by the presence of the mCav-1 scaffolding domain peptide in MFF-1 cells (Fig. 4) . These data suggested that one of the functional roles of mCav-1 protein is participation in the Jak-Stat signaling pathway, which is similar to the known role of mammalian caveolin-1. The caveolin-1 scaffolding domain inhibits many of the signal molecules in mammalian cells, such as the endothelial nitric oxide synthase, protein kinase A, thioredoxin reductase 1, transient receptor potential channel-1, etc. (Schlegel et al., 1999; Bucci et al., 2000; Kwiatek et al., 2006; Levin et al., 2007) . For this reason, we suggest that caveolae might also act as organizing centers for signaling molecules in the fish immune system.",

            "text": "We found that the expression of mCav-1 protein was clearly increased at 12 h and 24 h in the MFF-1 cells infected with ISKNV (Fig. 5) . The mCav-1 protein may therefore play a key role in virus infection. Every virus infection begins with entry of the virus into the host cell. Virus entry is a multi-stage process involving the specific attachment of the virus particle to cell surface receptor(s), followed by internalization of the virus into the cell and subsequent uncoating of the virion to release the capsids or their contents into the cytoplasm (S\u00e1nchez-San Mart\u00edn et al., 2004) . Each of these stages represents an important target for combating a virus before it can gain control over the host cell machinery for replication (Rojek et al., 2008) . In general, a number of different endocytosis pathway for viruses have been characterized, such as clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveola-mediated endocytosis, macropinocytosis, etc. (Vidricaire and Tremblay, 2007) . Unlike other forms of endocytosis, caveolin-1 is necessary for caveoladependent endocytosis, as shown by caveolin-1 siRNA experiments or overexpression of caveolin-1 (Nichols, 2003) . In our work, ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells was inhibited when cells were treated with mSDP (Fig. 6 ). This result indicated that ISKNV entry into MFF-1 cells was associated with caveolae/caveolin-1, and may occur via a caveola-dependent endocytosis pathway. Caveola-dependent endocytosis pathway has been demonstrated for many viruses, such as enterovirus (Stuart et al., 2002) , coronavirus 229E (Nomura et al., 2004) , and foot-and-mouth disease virus (O'Donnell et al., 2008) , etc. Thus, the entry of ISKNV into MFF-1 cells appears to occur via a caveola-dependent endocytosis pathway.",

Cholesterolrich fractions were isolated by 1% Triton X-100 treatment and ultracentrifugation in a sucrose gradient. After centrifugation, the total proteins in each fraction were separated by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with anti-mCav-1 antiserum. Lanes 1-12 are sucrose gradient fractions (top to bottom); lanes 4-9 are the DRM (detergentresistant membrane) fractions (caveolae fragments); lanes 10-12 are the DSM (detergent-soluble membrane) fractions (cytoplasm fragments). (C) M\u2424CD, filipin III, and nystatin altered the distribution of mCav-1 protein. Cells either were not treated or were incubated in the presence of M\u2424CD, filipin III, or nystatin for 60 min before isolation of the cholesterol-rich fractions. Each fraction was immunoblotted with anti-mCav-1 antiserum. Lanes 1-12 are the sucrose gradients fractions (top to bottom); lanes 4-9 are the DRM fractions; lanes 10-12 are the DSM fractions; the last lane is lysate from MFF-1 cells before extraction of cholesterol-rich fractions.
