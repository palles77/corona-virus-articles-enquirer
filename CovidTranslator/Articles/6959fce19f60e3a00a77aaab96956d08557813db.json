Secondly, evidence suggests that whilst deaths related to war injuries are increasing it varies from year to year. Therefore, it is vital to consider the burden of deaths related to war injuries over longer periods of time [5] .",

For example, in several less developed countries $10-$20 per capita is spent on military expenditure while only $1 per capita is spent on health [1] . Although less developed countries spent more money on military expenditure than on health the highest spending of money on such expenditure belongs to developed countries. For example, only in 2007 the costs of America's wars were running at $10 billion monthly [6] . This leads our world to a situation in which, some developed countries invest most money in wars whilst developing countries suffer most from the consequences of wars [7] . Therefore, as the fourth reason developing countries have substantial problems during peace time and they cannot endure extra problems which are caused by war and armed conflict. However, since they do not have an established surveillance and monitoring systems for health related problems during peacetime [8] they are not able to highlight and demonstrate the sheer magnitude of wars and armed conflicts on health whenever they erupt.",

Besides, there is evidence that involving parties in wars and armed conflicts always distort the real number of mortality, morbidity and disability of both soldiers and civilians for political purposes [2] . Therefore, epidemiologists should invent appropriate methods or tailor their existing methods of gathering data in order to better depict the sheer scale of wars and armed-conflicts on health. It should be mentioned that some of these changes in epidemiological methods were applied in Iraq for estimating mortality before and after the 2003 invasion [9] .",
