            "text": "The principal function of the respiratory system is gas exchange in which oxygen is transferred from the environment to the blood and carbon dioxide is moved in the opposite direction. Other important functions include a role in thermoregulation in most species; in acid-base regulation in concert with the kidney; in functioning as an endocrine organ (e.g., angiotensinconverting enzyme); in the metabolism of metabolically active substances, including eicosanoids and nitric oxide; and in the immune response to inhaled immunogens and pathogens. Capillaries in the lungs of the farm animal species and horses also possess intravascular macrophages, which are important as a reticuloendothelial organ in the processing of antigens-an action achieved by similar cells in the liver of dogs, cats, and humans. Interference with these functions can occur in a number of ways and can have a variety of manifestations that are apparent during disease. The most readily apparent failure of the respiratory system is failure of gas exchange with resultant hypoxemia and hypercapnia. However, failure of other functions of the respiratory system can also result in clinically apparent disease.",

Stimulation of respiratory centers in the medulla oblongata by low arterial oxygen tension (P a o 2 ) and high arterial carbon dioxide tension (P a co 2 ) causes an increase in respiratory minute volume mediated by an increase in tidal volume and respiratory frequency. Both low oxygen tension and high carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood, together or separately, are potent stimulators of these events. Inadequate tissue oxygenation also stimulates an increase in cardiac output, mainly as a result of increased heart rate and to a lesser extent by an increase in stroke volume. Splenic contraction, in those species such as the horse in which the spleen is an important reservoir of red blood cells, increases both blood volume and hemoglobin concentration, thereby increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.

The clinical signs of acute hypercapnia are initial anxiety followed by central nervous system depression and eventual coma and death. These clinical abnormalities are attributable to declines in the pH of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), a consequence of the ease with which carbon dioxide crosses the blood-brain barrier. Decreases in CSF pH are greater for respiratory acidosis than for a similar degree of metabolic acidosis. Severe hypercapnia also causes peripheral vasodilation, which can contribute to arterial hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmia. The acid-base effects of chronic hypercapnia are compensated by renal mechanisms that return the arterial and CSF pH to almost normal and therefore do not cause more than mild clinical disease in most instances.

Sound is transmitted most readily through dense liquids such as water. Most tissue, except fat, is approximately 70% water and transmits sounds readily. Sound is reflected at the interface of two media of markedly different densitiessuch as air and tissue-and less sound is transmitted. Thus in the normal lung there is marked attenuation (softening) of breath sounds because of the extensive air-tissue interfaces. This is evident by comparing the intensity of breath sounds heard over the trachea to those heard over the chest wall. However, lung sounds are more readily transmitted when areas of the lung do not contain air, such as occurs with atelectasis, pulmonary edema or infiltration of lung by inflammatory exudates. Sounds generated in the large airways are more readily transmitted through this consolidated tissue and are evident at the chest wall as louder bronchial breath sounds. The presence of bronchial breath sounds that are audible on the chest surface is dependent on the presence of a patent bronchus with airflow to generate the lung sounds and of tissue that readily transmits the sounds generated in the bronchus. Lung sounds will not be heard if they are not generated (as a result of lack of airflow in bronchi) or are muffled by extensive accumulations of fluid or fat between the lung and the chest wall. Lung sounds are reduced in animals with airflow of low velocity in large airways, such as occurs in animals with low tidal volumes, or in which there is obliteration of the bronchial lumen by fluid or tissue. Low tidal volumes occur in animals at rest or in those in which there is rapid but shallow (low tidal volume) breathing. Obliteration of the bronchial lumen occurs in many diseases, including pneumonia.",

An expeditious means of temporarily increasing the animal's tidal volume is to occlude the nostrils for a brief period (30-60 seconds) . When the animal is again allowed to breathe, it will take several large, deep breaths, during which lung sounds can be auscultated. However, the increase in tidal volume is transient and does not permit time for detailed auscultation of the chest. A preferred technique is to place an airtight bag over the animal's muzzle such that all the air that it inhales is contained within the bag. The volume of air in the bag should exceed the anticipated stimulated tidal volume of the animal. As a rule of thumb, the volume of the bag should be sufficient to allow the animal a tidal volume of 10 to 15 mL of air per kilogram of body weight (BW). A 500-kg horse or cow therefore needs a bag that contains 10 L of air. Hyperventilation is stimulated by an increase in carbon dioxide content of inspired air with subsequent hypercapnia and stimulation of the respiratory center. A more refined technique has the animal inhaling gas that is 5% carbon dioxide and 95% oxygen, thereby preventing hypoxemia as a result of the examination. Rebreathing examinations (or \"bagging\") are not indicated if abnormal lung sounds are detected on initial examination because the results of the rebreathing examination will not add any additional information. Animals in respiratory distress should not be subjected to a rebreathing examination because it might worsen the hypoxemia or hypercapnia already present and is inhumane. Rebreathing examinations are indicated when respiratory disease is suspected but initial auscultation of the thorax does not reveal abnormal lung sounds.",

Space-occupying masses between the lung and the thoracic wall also cause a relative absence of breath sounds over the site as do areas of lung that are not ventilated, such as a pulmonary abscess. Thoracic auscultation is of limited value in detecting localized areas of consolidation in the lungs of calves or foals, with ultrasonographic examination having much greater sensitivity. The sensitivity of auscultation to detect lung consolidation, detected by ultrasonographic examination, in calves is only 6%. 1 Computer-aided lung auscultation has a reasonable sensitivity for detection of bovine respiratory disease in feedlot cattle (93%) compared with clinical examination by a veterinarian. 2 Increased loudness of breath sounds occurs in some instances and can have diagnostic importance. The normal breath sounds heard over the trachea may sound abnormally loud over the lungs because of changes in the transmission properties of the respiratory system. This is because when sound waves pass through structures of different physical properties, the amount of sound transmitted depends on the matching of acoustic properties of the different structures. Consolidation results in less reflection of sound at the thoracic wall and consequently more transmission to the stethoscope. Thus in consolidation, the breath sounds are much louder than normal. These are harsh breath sounds that approximate those heard over the trachea. They are audible on inspiration and expiration but become louder on expiration in abnormal states such as consolidation or atelectasis. Any disease in which the bronchial lumen remains open and the surrounding lung tissue has been replaced by cells, exudate, or tissues (consolidation) that transmit sound without reflection will result in increased bronchial sounds.",

Coughing is infrequent in the early stages of respiratory tract disease but can become frequent as the degree of inflammation in the larynx, trachea and bronchi becomes more severe. Assessment of the severity of coughing, at least in horses, requires prolonged observation (preferably for an hour). Coughing is a fairly specific but not very sensitive indicator of pulmonary inflammation. If coughing is detected, it is quite likely that the animal has inflammation of the airways, whereas failure to detect coughing does not reliably rule out the presence of clinically significant airway inflammation. The severity of coughing in horses is closely linked to the severity of inflammation and accumulation of mucopus in the airways. Racehorses that cough are 10 times more likely to have more than 20% neutrophils in a tracheal aspirate and more than 100 times more likely to have more than 80% neutrophils. The frequency of coughing correlates well with maximal changes in pleural pressure, extent of mucus accumulation, and proportion of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of horses with heaves (recurrent airway obstruction).

The respiratory efforts of horses during nasal occlusion can therefore be used to simulate those during exercise, thereby permitting detection of disorders of the pharynx (displacement of the soft palate) and larynx (mild laryngeal hemiplegia) that would not otherwise be apparent in a resting horse. Rhinolaryngoscopic examination can also be performed on horses running on a treadmill (see following \"Exercise Testing\" section) or, by use of dynamic endoscopy, in horses running over ground. 7 Bronchoscopic examination requires an endoscope that is at least 2 m in length and less than 1.5 cm in diameter. Horses must be sedated for bronchoscopic examination (a combination of xylazine, 0.25-0.5 mg/kg intravenously [IV] , and butorphanol, 1 mg per 40 kg IV, works well). Instillation of lidocaine (20 mL of 2% lidocaine diluted with 40 mL of isotonic saline or similar) minimizes coughing. The lidocaine is instilled into the trachea through the biopsy channel of the endoscope. The airways are examined in a systematic fashion and results are recorded using a system that has been described for identifying the major airways.

The process involves identification of areas of opacity, their extent and characteristics of the borders of the opacity (poorly defined vs. discrete), and the number and location of opacities. A differential diagnosis can then be established for each pattern of abnormalities (Box 12-1). 14 Radiographs of calves and foals can be recorded with them standing or recumbent. Images obtained with the foal or calf in lateral recumbency with the forelimbs pulled forward permit optimal examination of the cranial thorax. However, calves or foals that are recumbent for prolonged periods of time (e.g., > 30 min) can develop atelectasis of the down lung that can mimic pneumonia radiographically. Ventrodorsal views assist with localizing lesions in foals and calves. Radiographic evidence of lung disease is common in ill neonatal foals (74% having such lesions in one study), and is not related to clinical evidence of respiratory disease or dyspnea. The characteristics of lung lesions detected in neonatal foals are associated with likelihood of survival. Guidelines for recognition of pulmonary patterns in foals have been proposed (Table 12 -2), and these guidelines are likely to be useful aids for interpretation and Other diagnostic tests necessary Normal or airway inflammation/RAO than 50% of affected foals detected by radiographic examination. 15 Many pulmonary diseases do not have lesions that are readily detected on radiographic examination. Failure to detect abnormalities on radiographic examination of the thorax does not eliminate pulmonary disease. Furthermore, radiographically detectable signs of lung disease can persist after the animal has clinical and clinicopathologic signs of recovery or improvement.",

The ultrasound probe is slowly moved from dorsal to ventral while the examiner studies the images. When one scanning of one intercostal space is completed, the probe is moved to the most dorsal aspect of the next intercostal space, and the examination is repeated. Each side of the chest is examined in this manner. This consistent and thorough examination ensures that no important or localized abnormalities are missed. The examination is performed in adult horses and cattle with the animal standing. The rostral thorax is scanned by pulling the ipsilateral forelimb forward. This is more readily achieved in horses than in cattle. Thorough examination of the rostral thorax might require placing the animal in lateral recumbency. Calves and foals can be examined either standing or in lateral recumbency.",

The differences between tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid arise because cell populations, and types of cell, differ markedly among segments of airways. There is no correlation between cytologic features of tracheal aspirates and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of horses, and this is probably the case in other species. Tracheal aspirates are representative of cell and bacterial populations of the large conducting airways (trachea and mainstem bronchi), which can originate in both the large and small conducting airways and the alveoli. Secretions of more distal airways can be modified during rostrad movement, such that fluid in a tracheal aspirate is not representative of processes deeper within the lung. Furthermore, disease localized to one region of the lung can alter tracheal fluid. Examination of tracheal aspirates is useful for detecting inflammation of the large airways and for isolation of microorganisms causing disease in these structures. 39, 40 There is no good evidence that findings on examination of tracheal aspirates correlate with abnormalities in pulmonary function, although they can correlate with exercise performance (racing). 41, 42 Tracheal aspirates do not accurately reflect lesions in the lungs of horses, but presence of excess mucus, detected on endoscopic examination, is associated with impaired performance, whereas presence of excess neutrophils is not. 41 Bronchoalveolar lavage is useful for sampling secretions in the more distal airways. It provides a sample of secretions that have not been contaminated by upper respiratory tract organisms or secretions before collection, and the sample is therefore assumed to be more representative of small airway and, to a lesser extent, pulmonary parenchymal and alveolar secretions or exudates. Bronchoalveolar lavage is useful in the detection of widespread lung disease but not necessarily in the detection of localized disease. Tracheal aspirates, because they in theory represent a composite sample of secretions from all regions of the lung, are likely to be more sensitive in detecting focal disease, such as a pulmonary abscess. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid composition correlates well with pulmonary function in horses.",

An alternative to polyethylene tubing is to use an 8 to 10 French male dog urinary catheter inserted through an appropriately sized cannula.

The skin site is prepared aseptically, and a short stab incision is made after the area has been anesthetized. The cannula is removed to avoid cutting the tube, and the tube is pushed in as far as the thoracic inlet. Fluid typically pools in the trachea at the thoracic inlet in horses with lung disease (the tracheal lake or pool), and it is this fluid that is aspirated. Thirty to 50 mL of sterile saline (not bacteriostatic saline) is rapidly infused. The catheter or tubing should be rotated until tension is felt on aspiration by a syringe.

Tracheal aspirates of normal animals rarely yield any bacterial growth on culture. Growth of unusual organisms or known oropharyngeal commensal bacteria from samples obtained by endoscopic examination should not be given undue clinical significance as they probably result from contamination of the tracheal aspirate during collection. Pseudomonas spp. and anaerobes isolated from tracheal aspirates collected by endoscopy are almost always contaminants and of no clinical significance. The extent of contamination of tracheal aspirate samples by oropharyngeal bacteria can be estimated from the number of squamous epithelial cells in the sample. There is an apparent approximate linear relationship between the number of squamous cells per milliliter of fluid and the number of colony-forming bacterial units in tracheal aspirates. Samples containing over approximately 10 squamous epithelial cells per milliliter of tracheal aspirate had markedly greater bacterial contamination. Examination of Gram-stained smears of tracheal fluid is specific but not very sensitive for detection of bacteria, compared with culture. In other words, if examination of a Gramstained smear of tracheal fluid reveals bacteria, then the sample is likely to yield bacteria on culture, whereas failure to detect bacteria predicts poorly the likelihood of growth of bacteria on culture of the sample. This indicates that examination of Gram-stained samples of tracheal fluid does not reliably predict bacterial isolation, and if an infectious etiology is suspected, the fluid should be cultured. Results of the microbiological examination of the tracheal fluid should be consistent with the animal's clinical condition and expected isolates.",

Despite this shortcoming, the technique has been used to detect pneumonia associated with Mycoplasma sp. in cattle. Contraindications are few, with respiratory distress being an obvious one. Complications of bronchoalveolar lavage are also few, and include a mild neutrophilia in lavaged sections of lungs and changes in phagocytic function of pulmonary macrophages, and microbial content, for several days after the procedure. Transient bronchial collapse can occur during the procedure in horses and is an indication of airway inflammation. 49 A shortcoming of bronchoalveolar lavage is that it lavages only a small region of the lung, with the risk that focal lung disease is not detected. There is clear evidence that important differences can exist in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from left and right lungs and that the ideal technique involves collection of fluid from both lungs. 50 This is best exemplified in pneumonia in horses, in which bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from pneumonic horses can contain large numbers and a high proportion of neutrophils or can be normal, depending on the lung or area of lung lavaged. Therefore the bronchoalveolar lavage procedure is a very specific but not very sensitive test for pneumonia in horses. Abnormal lavage fluid is helpful diagnostically, whereas normal results do not exclude the presence of foci of pulmonary disease. The lavage samples may be normal in horses affected with pneumonia or pleuropneumonia, and because of these false-negative results, this is not the best diagnostic technique to evaluate a horse with pneumonia. In contrast, the tracheobronchial aspirates are more sensitive and most horses with pneumonia have cytologic abnormalities.",

The use of different volumes alters the extent of dilution of the fluid. There is a need for uniformity in technique. An approach to this problem has been to measure substances in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid that can provide an indication of the extent of dilution of the sample. Both endogenous (urea, albumin) and exogenous (inulin, methylene blue) markers have been used. Dilution factors using urea concentration in plasma and in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid appear to be useful. The assumption is that urea concentrations in bronchial and alveolar secretions will be identical to that in plasma. The formula for correcting for dilution that occurs during collection of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is: Samples for cytology are submitted for preparation involving centrifugation of the sample to concentrate cells for preparation of slides for staining and microscopic examination. At least for samples from horses, examination of smears made directly from the sample, without centrifugation, is diagnostically useful. As for tracheal fluid, the proportion of mast cells in equine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is underestimated if cells are stained with fast Romanowsky stain (Diff-Quik). Ideally, five fields are examined for each slide, rather than simply counting 400 cells, to ensure that the cell proportions are accurately reported, particularly for mast cells. 51 ",

Sampling of pleural fluid is usually accompanied by therapeutic drainage, in which case the cannula used for sampling is larger than if only collection of pleural fluid is desired. Contraindications are minimal, especially if the procedure can be performed under ultrasonographic guidance. The principal contraindication is the inability to restrain an unruly animal because this increases the risk of laceration of the lung or a coronary vessel, or cardiac puncture. Complications include hemorrhage from lacerated intercostal or pleural vessels, pneumothorax secondary to laceration of the lung or introduction of air through the cannula, cardiac puncture and sudden death, irritation of the myocardium and ventricular arrhythmia (premature ventricular contractions), or coronary artery laceration and subsequent cardiac tamponade and death. There is a risk of cellulitis at the site of centesis, especially if indwelling cannulas are maintained for more than a day. The procedure is performed with the animal standing. Sedation or systemic analgesia is usually not needed, unless it is medically indicated or the animal is not easily restrained. The equipment for sampling of pleural fluid from adult horses or cattle is a blunt 10-to 15-cm cannula of approximately 3 mm in diameter (such as a bovine teat cannula) or a 7.5-cm spinal needle. The blunt-tipped cannula is preferred because use of it reduces the risk of laceration of vital structures. A three-way stopcock or similar device should be attached to the hub of the needle or cannula and closed to prevent aspiration of air when the pleural cavity is entered. The site for centesis is best identified by ultrasonographic examination of the thorax or, if that is not available, by percussion and auscultation of the chest to identify the fluid level. A commonly used site is the seventh intercostal space on the left side and the sixth intercostal space on the right side. The skin should be clipped of hair and aseptically prepared. The region can be anesthetized with approximately 10 mL of 2% lidocaine, mepiricaine, or a similar product. The cannula or needle should be introduced over the rib and then directed cranial to the rib (the intercostal vessels and nerves course along the caudal edge of the rib). If a cannula is used, then a slight \"popping\" sensation is felt as the cannula perforates the parietal pleura.

The tubing is attached to a loudspeaker, which is used to generated square-wave signals containing harmonics between 0 and 10 Hz. Information from the system is analyzed using a computer program and indices of pulmonary resistance and reactance are determined. The forced oscillation technique in feedlot cattle with naturally occurring shipping fever indicates the presence of a large increase in pulmonary resistance and a decrease in dynamic compliance with obstructive lung disease located mainly at the level of large airways but also in small airways. The test is more sensitive than conventional techniques in detecting partial upper airway obstruction, heaves, and inflammatory airway disease in horses, and in pigs with lung disease. [54] [55] [56] Impulse oscillometry can also be used to monitor response to therapy. 56 The sensitivity of these tests can be increased by provocative tests in which animals are administered agents, such as histamine or methacholine, that cause bronchoconstriction in animals with reactive airways.",

Depending on the software included with the instrument, various derived values are also reported, including bicarbonate concentration, base excess, and oxygen saturation. It is important to understand that oxygen saturation reported by blood gas instruments is a calculated value and might not be correct. Oxygen saturation is measured by a cooximeter, which is different from a blood gas machine, and the amount of oxygen carried by hemoglobin is then calculated from this value, with the assumption that each gram of hemoglobin, when fully saturated, carries approximately 1.34 to 1.39 mL of oxygen. The total oxygen content of blood is calculated by adding the amount carried by hemoglobin to the amount of oxygen dissolved in the aqueous phase of the blood. The formula is where O 2 content is in mL/100 mL, S a o 2 is the arterial oxygen saturation (%), 1.34 is the amount of oxygen carried by fully saturated hemoglobin (mL/g), Hbwsa is the concentration of hemoglobin in blood (g/100 mL), 0.003 is the amount of oxygen dissolved in the aqueous phase of 100 mL of blood for each 1-mm Hg increase in Po 2 , and P a o 2 is the oxygen tension in arterial blood.

However, measurement of arterial oxygen content is not as readily accomplished as measurement of arterial oxygen tension. Therefore in animals with normal hemoglobin concentration and function the arterial oxygen tension is used as a surrogate measure of arterial oxygen content. In doing so, it must be recognized that the extent of hemoglobin saturation with oxygen is dependent on both the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen and the oxygen tension of the blood. The oxygen tension/percentage saturation relationship is sigmoidal, with 50% saturation occurring at about 30 mm Hg in most species (there are minor variations) and 80% saturation at a Po 2 of 45 to 55 mm Hg. The sigmoidal shape of the oxygen-hemoglobin saturation curve has important clinical consequences. Small decrements in P a o 2 from normal values (usually 95-105 mm Hg in animals breathing ambient air at sea level) have a minimal effect on oxygen content of blood. Many modern blood gas analyzers have software that calculates oxygen content of blood, but it must be recognized that these calculations often use an assumed, not measured, hemoglobin concentration (usually 15 g/dL) and values for the human So 2 -Po 2 relationship. These assumed values may not be correct for animals, and one should always check the assumptions used to calculate oxygen content of blood before accepting and acting on those values.

If the animal's body temperature is markedly different from that, then the reported Po 2 can be erroneous. For instance, the P a o 2 of a horse with a body temperature of 40\u00b0C (104.0 F) measured using an analyzer with a temperature of 37\u00b0 C (98.6 F) would be 80 mm Hg (the Pco 2 would be 35 mm Hg).

Lactate production is related to the severity and duration of hypoxia, with more severe hypoxia resulting in greater accumulation of lactate in tissues and its subsequent diffusion or transport into blood. Hypoxia also reduces the rate of removal of lactate from blood. The combination of increased production and decreased removal causes lactate to accumulate in blood. Measurement of blood lactate concentrations (which are usually lower than plasma lactate concentrations) is gaining increasing clinical usefulness as point-ofcare analyzers become more readily available and testing more affordable. Samples for measurement of blood lactate can be collected into syringes containing heparin solution (as used for measurement of blood gas tensions) if the sample is to be analyzed within 30 minutes. Samples should be stored in iced water until analysis. Prolonged storage at room temperature results in increases in blood lactate concentration.

The technique is most useful by providing a histologic diagnosis of diffuse lung diseases or, when used with ultrasonographic guidance or performed by thoracoscopy, for focal disease. Biopsy provided a diagnosis in ~80% of 65 horses with clinical evidence of diffuse lung disease. 66 Biopsy is usually percutaneous but can also be performed during thoracoscopic examination. 13, 67 Indications for the procedure include the presence of diseases of the lungs in which a diagnosis cannot be arrived at through other forms of examination, including tracheal aspiration or bronchoalveolar lavage. It can also be used for assessing the severity of histologic changes and response to therapy. The procedure is best suited for widespread diseases of the lung, but it can be used for diseases that produce focal lesions if the biopsy is performed with ultrasonographic guidance. Contraindications include abnormalities in clotting function, pneumothorax, and severe respiratory distress. The danger in performing lung biopsy in animals in severe respiratory distress is that complications of biopsy, such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, or hemorrhage into airways, could further impair lung function and cause the death of the animal.",

The most important of these in a clinical setting is videoendoscopy during exercise to detect dysfunction of the upper airway of horses. With the exception of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy, there is only poor correlation between results of endoscopic examination performed in standing horses compared with results of dynamic endoscopic examination during exercise. 6, 71, 72 Endoscopy of standing horses has very limited capacity to detect disorders that occur only during exercise, and some disorders of the upper respiratory tract, such as progressive weakness of the laryngeal abductor muscles, axial deviation of the aryepiglottic fold, and epiglottic retroversion, can only be diagnosed by endoscopic examination performed during strenuous exercise. 71, 73 Another finding is the presence of multiple upper airway abnormalities in a high proportion of horses examined during exercise. 7, 71, 74, 75 Although testing has historically been conducted on a high-speed treadmill, a recent advance has been the development of endoscopes and recording systems that allow horses to be examined while exercising in the field (overground or dynamic endoscopy). 7,73-83 Such overground endoscopy systems comprise an endoscope, water pump, endoscope control unit (for manipulating the tip of the endoscope), and a recording/transmitting unit carried on the horse or the rider ( Fig. 12 -2) weighing up to 2.5 kg. 77, 78 The source of light are light emitting diodes in the end of the endoscope. Preferred is a recording unit that simultaneously transmits the image in real time, usually using Bluetooth or similar technology, to an observer situated a short distance (up to 220 m depending on the unit) from the horse. 77 The development of overground endoscopy has enabled more widespread use of examination of the upper airway of horses during exercise and the refinement of understanding of dynamic obstructive disorders of the upper airway.",

The efficacy of nasal insufflation of oxygen through intranasal catheters in foals depends on the rate of oxygen administration and whether catheters are inserted in one or both nostrils. When arterial oxygen tensions (P a o 2 ) and inspired oxygen fraction (F i o 2 ) are measured in arterial blood collected from the metatarsal artery and thoracic trachea, respectively, of healthy, standing, 5-to 7-day-old foals, insufflation results in significant increases in F i o 2 and arterial oxygen tension (Table 12-5) . Unilateral administration of oxygen at flow rate of 50 mL O 2 per kg body weight per minute resulted in an increase in F i o 2 from 18% to 23% and in arterial oxygen tension from 93 to 136 mm Hg. Bilateral administration and increased rates of flow up to 200 mL/ kg/min resulted in further increases. 85 It is important to note that this study was done in healthy, standing foals and that the effect of oxygen insufflation on P a o 2 could be attenuated by recumbency and lung disease. However, F i o 2 is unlikely to be affected by these variables and this information will allow calculation of the P a o 2 :F i o 2 ratio in foals as a way of detecting lung injury. Intranasal catheters are also difficult to maintain in active sucking foals and require the use of higher oxygen flow rates to achieve beneficial effects. Flow rates in foals with lung injury should be adjusted based on repeated measurement of arterial oxygen tension with the aim of maintaining P a o 2 at \u2265 100 mm Hg and S a o 2 at greater than 90%.",

Animals with hypercarbia and hypoxemia are probably hypoventilating, and consideration should be given to increasing the animal's minute ventilation through relief of airway obstruction (e.g., by foreign bodies or bronchoconstriction), improvement in function of the respiratory muscles (restore hydration, maintain normal blood concentrations of electrolytes, including calcium), and positional adjustments (foals have better respiratory function when in sternal recumbency).

Doxapram (constant rate infusion of 0.02-0.05 mg/kg/h IV) is more effective than caffeine (loading dose of 7.5-12 mg/kg followed by maintenance dose of 2.5-5 mg/kg PO q24 h) in reducing arterial carbon dioxide tension neonatal foals with respiratory acidosis (P a co 2 \u2265 55 mm Hg and pH < 7.35) secondary to neonatal encephalopathy. There was no difference in survival rates although the number of animals (eight in each group) was likely too low to detect important effects on survival. 86 Similarly, in healthy newborn calves doxapram (40 mg IV) increased respiratory rate, peak inspiratory and expiratory flow rates, minute volume and P a o 2 , and reduced P a co 2 within minutes of administration, although the effect lasted less than 90 minutes. 87, 88 Administration of doxapram (40 mg IV), atropine or caffeine to neonatal calves with naturally occurring asphyxia resulted in improvement in arterial blood gas values with all treatments with the greatest effect, and lowest death rate, among doxapram-treated calves. 89 Doxapram appears to be useful in stimulating respiration in foals with pharmacologic depression of the respiratory center by general anesthetics. 90",

In cattle, the disease is commonest in 6-to 9-year-olds and may be sufficiently extensive to cause bulging of the facial bones. The tumors are adenocarcinomas arising from the ethmoidal mucosa, and they metastasize in lungs and lymph nodes. Clinical signs include nasal discharge, often bloody; mouth breathing; and assumption of a stretchedneck posture. There is evidence to suggest that a virus may be associated. A similar syndrome is observed in cattle with other nasal tumors such as osteoma.

The disease can be reproduced by inoculation of 14-day-old lambs with the virus. 2 The clinical findings include a persistent serous, mucous, or mucopurulent nasal discharge and stridor. 3 Affected sheep and goats progressively develop anorexia, dyspnea, and mouth breathing, and most die within 90 days after the onset of signs. The tumors originate unilaterally or occasionally bilaterally in the olfactory mucosa of the ethmoid turbinates. 3 They are locally invasive but not metastatic. Histologically, the tumors are classified as adenomas or, more frequently, adenocarcinomas. Budding and extracellular retrovirus-like particles have been observed ultrastructurally in enzootic nasal tumors of goats. A reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) can detect the virus in healthy and affected sheep, although its clinical utility in allowing control of the infection has not been determined. 4 (Reproduced with permission. 12 ) Progressive Ethmoidal Hematomas in Equids Ethmoidal hematomas are non-neoplastic tumors that are encapsulated, usually expanding, insidious, potentially distorting and obstructing lesions of the nasal cavities that occur in horses. 5, 6 The etiology is unknown but a viral etiology (papilloma virus) should be considered. Chronic unilateral nasal discharge is common, and lesions are usually advanced at the time of diagnosis. There is stertorous breathing and upper airway obstruction in later stages of the disease. The nasal discharge is serous or mucoid and intermittently sanguineous, sanguinopurulent, and usually unrelated to exercise. The tumor arises in the ethmoids and can invade paranasal sinuses, and especially the sphenopalatine sinus, and is bilateral in approximately 50% of horses. 7 Diagnosis is made by endoscopy and radiography (Figs. 12-3 and 12-4). Computed tomographic examination yields information additional that obtained by radiographic examination and is useful in determining treatment modality and approach and prognosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) yields similar information to that obtained by computed tomography (CT) examination. 8 Surgical removal is possible and successful in some cases. Surgical removal is challenging and often associated with clinically important hemorrhage and the need for intraoperative or postoperative blood transfusion. 9 Surgical removal of the tumor can be achieved in some horses during a standing procedure, but the long-term success has yet to be determined. 10 Multiple intralesional injection of formalin (1-100 mL of 10% neutral buffered formalin injected at 10-day intervals) through an endoscope can cure the tumor, but there is the risk of serious adverse effects if the ethmoidal hematoma penetrates the cribriform plate. The procedure involves the injection of a sufficient volume of 10% neutral buffered formalin to distend the lesion. The formalin is injected via an endoscope once every 10 days until the lesion resolves by effects can occur with use of these treatments in horses with ethmoidal hematomas.",

These tissues form the mucosal associated lymphoid tissues and are an important component of the normal immunologic response of horses. The condition occurs in a high proportion of Thoroughbred racehorses and is probably as common in other breeds of horse. 1 The condition is first detectable in 2-to 3-month-old foals and reaches its highest prevalence and greatest severity in yearlings and 2-year-old horses in race training. It is evident on endoscopic examination as diffuse, multiple, small, white nodules in the roof and walls of the pharynx. The nodules can be confluent, and there is often excessive mucus present in severely affected horses. The clinical significance of the condition is debated. 1-3 Affected racehorses do not have impaired race performance. Affected horses recover spontaneously as they age or after treatment with topical antiinflammatory drugs. The condition is probably a normal aging process and necessary for development of a competent immune system in young horses. Infestation of the nasopharynx of horses by larvae of the bot fly Gasterophilus pecorum causes obstruction of the upper airway and a parasitic pharyngitis. Diagnosis is by visualization of the parasite during endoscopic examination.",

In chronic infections, the cough may be less frequent and distressing and is usually dry and harsh. If the lesions cause much exudation or ulceration of the mucosa, as in bacterial tracheobronchitis secondary to infectious bovine rhinotracheitis in cattle, the cough is moist, and thick mucus, flecks of blood, and fibrin may be coughed up. The cough is very painful, and the animal makes attempts to suppress it. Fever and toxemia are common, and affected animals cannot eat or drink normally. Inspiratory dyspnea varies with the degree of obstruction and is usually accompanied by a loud stridor and harsh breath sounds on each inspiration. These are best heard over the trachea, although they are quite audible over the base of the lung, being most distinct on inspiration.

Dynamic collapse is a cause of exercise intolerance in racehorses that is evident only by endoscopic examination of the trachea during strenuous exercise. Restriction of the tracheal lumen and laxity of the dorsal tracheal membrane results in varying degrees of inspiratory dyspnea with stridor, coughing, and reduced exercise tolerance. Tracheal collapse in American Miniature horses is not uncommon. 2 The clinical signs of respiratory distress, tachypnea, inspiratory honking noises, and increased respiratory effort occur in adult horses (mean age 11, range 2-15 years) and are exacerbated by exercise, pregnancy, and eating. None of the affected horses in one case series had a history of trauma. Confirmation of the diagnosis is by endoscopic tracheobronchial examination or radiography ( Fig. 12-6 ). The severity of tracheal collapse is graded: Grade 1 = minor protrusion of the dorsal tracheal membrane into the lumen with less than 25% reduction in airway diameter; Grade 2 = mild elongation and flattening of the tracheal rings with 50% reduction in airway diameter; Grade 3 = marked flattening of the tracheal rings and lengthening of the dorsal tracheal membrane with 75% reduction in airway diameter; and Grade 4 = severe flattening of tracheal rings with dorsal elevation of the ventral tracheal surface and an airway diameter less than 10% of normal. 2 The case-fatality rate is high (~80%). Tracheotomy for emergency treatment of severe disease is not useful unless the collapsed trachea is dilated by an endotracheal tube. Necropsy examination of four affected horses revealed chondromalacia. The cause of the condition is not known. Tracheal prostheses have been used for the treatment of tracheal collapse in calves and Miniature horses, 3-5 although given the granulomatous lesions and must be treated with antimicrobials. Calves with calf diphtheria should be treated with a broadspectrum antimicrobial daily for 3 to 5 days. Several days are usually required for the animal to return to normal. A broadspectrum antimicrobial daily or more often for up to 3 weeks or more may be necessary for treatment of the chondritis.",

The larynx is easily visualized and necrotic tissue removed using a curette. The edges of the cartilages are sutured closed. A wedge-shaped piece of the first two tracheal rings is removed to create a tracheostomy, which is allowed to close after about 1 week when the postoperative swelling has subsided with the aid of daily care of the surgical site and the possible use of flunixin meglumide. No tracheotomy tube is required. extent of collapse and high rate of complications associated with surgical repair, there is not an ideal method for alleviating the condition. 6 A \"honking\" respiratory noise is common in affected calves when coughing spontaneously or when the trachea is palpated. Tracheal collapse in calves is associated with injuries associated with dystocia and clinical signs usually occur within a few weeks after birth. In some cases the trachea is compressed at the level of the thoracic inlet in association with callus formation of healing fractured ribs attributed to dystocia. In some cases in cattle, there is no history of dystocia or preexisting disease or previous manipulation of the trachea, and the overall lumen size may be reduced to less than 25% of normal. Auscultation of the thorax may reveal loud referred upper airway sounds. A similar syndrome is described in pigs with development of acute tracheal edema, hemorrhage, and tracheitis. Clinical signs are of sudden onset of respiratory distress, openmouth breathing, loud inspiratory stridor, and death soon after clinical signs became apparent. 7 The lesion is edema, hemorrhage, and mixed cellular infiltration in the tunica adventitia, with lung lesions of mild to severe fibrinonecrotic or hemorrhagic pleuropneumonia. No infectious etiology has been identified. 7 Tracheal obstruction and collapse can result from tracheitis associated with pneumonia in the horse, tracheal neoplasia, tracheal stricture, presence of foreign bodies in the trachea, and compression by masses external to the trachea. It is suggested that increased respiratory effort associated with pneumonia causes collapse of the soft tissue structures of the trachea, rather than collapse of the tracheal rings. Tracheal rupture as a result of blunt trauma in the horse may result in severe subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. Conservative therapy is usually successful. Tracheal compression secondary to enlargement of the cranial mediastinal lymph nodes can also cause inspiratory dyspnea, and conservative treatment with antimicrobials is successful.",

Atelectasis is therefore classified as obstruction (resorption), compression, or contraction. Obstru ction atelectasis occurs secondary to obstruction of the airways, with subsequent resorption of alveolar gases and collapse of the alveoli. This disease is usually caused by obstruction of small bronchioles by fluid and exudate. It is common in animals with pneumonia or aspiration of a foreign body. Compression atelectasis occurs when intrathoracic (intrapleural) pressure exceeds alveolar pressure, thereby deflating alveoli. This occurs when there is excessive pleural fluid or the animal has a pneumothorax. It also occurs in the dependent lung or portions of lung in recumbent animals and is evident on computed tomographic or radiographic examination of the lungs of foals ( Fig. 12-7 ). 1,2 Compression atelectasis is the explanation for the large shunt fraction and hypoxemia that occurs in anesthetized horses, causing marked reduction in ventilation of the dependent lung. 3 Compression atelectasis and secondary bronchopneumonia can occur in horses kept in flotation tanks for up to several weeks for treatment of skeletal injuries. Contraction atelectasis occurs when there is compression of parts of the lung by fibrotic changes in the pleura. Patchy atelectasis occurs in the absence of surfactant, such as can occur in newborns. Failure of the lung to inflate, or development of atelectasis of the lungs of the newborn, usually those born prematurely, occurs because of lack of pulmonary surfactant. The disorder can progress to hyaline membrane disease. Affected newborn animals are severely dyspneic, hypoxemic, cyanotic, and weak, and they commonly die in a few hours.",

The development of interstitial emphysema depends largely upon the amount of interstitial tissue that is present and is most common in cattle and pigs.

Of 109 horses with esophageal obstruction, 39 had clinical signs of aspiration pneumonia. 2 Obstruction of the esophagus in horses, and in other species, leads to the accumulation of saliva and feed material in the esophagus oral to the obstruction. When the esophagus is full, this material accumulates in the pharynx, with subsequent aspiration into the trachea resulting in contamination of the trachea and lower airways with feed material and oropharyngeal bacteria. Feed material is irritant and also causes obstruction of the smaller airways. Pulmonary defense mechanisms are weakened or overwhelmed by the contamination, and infection and pneumonia result. The duration of esophageal obstruction is a good indicator of the risk of aspiration pneumonia, although the extent of contamination of the trachea with feed material is not. Affected horses are pyrexic, tachycardic, and toxemic. Lung sounds can include crackles and wheezes, but the only auscultatory abnormality can be decreased breath sounds in the ventral thorax. Radiography reveals a characteristic pattern of bronchopneumonia restricted, at least initially, to the cranioventral and caudoventral lung lobes in adult horses. Ultrasonography reveals comet tail lesions in the ventral lung fields and variable consolidation. Pleuritis is a not uncommon sequela to aspiration pneumonia. Examination of tracheal aspirates demonstrates neutrophilic inflammation with presence of degenerate neutrophils, bacteria that are both intracellular and extracellular, and plant material. Culture of tracheal aspirates yields one or more of a wide variety of bacteria, including S. zooepidemicus, Pasteurella sp., Actinobacillus sp., E. coli, and anaerobes. Treatment involves prompt relief of the esophageal obstruction and administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials, such as a combination of penicillin, aminoglycoside, and metronidazole.

Exudative fluid is commonly present in horses and cattle with pleuropneumonia and often contains echogenic material. Serosanguineous or hemorrhagic fluid is also more echogenic than transudates.

Closed pneumothorax refers to gas accumulation in the pleural space in the absence of an open chest wound.

The result is a rapid worsening of the pneumothorax. Pneumothorax can be unilateral or bilateral.

[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Congenital hernia results from failure of complete formation of the diaphragm during embryogenesis during a process involving the septum transversum, dorsal embryonic mesentery, pleuroperitoneal folds, and body wall mesenchyme. Congenital hernias develop as a result of defects in the diaphragmatic musculature when the septum transversum and pleuroperitoneal folds do not fuse completely or in the dorsal tendinous portion of the diaphragm. 2 Such hernias are characterized by a hernia sac composed of peritoneal and pleural membranes that occurs to one side or the other of midline (usually the right side in horses) in the right ventral (retrosternal hernia) or left dorsal crus. 1, 2 The borders of congenital hernias are usually smooth, fibrous, and thickened and have a characteristic histologic appearance. In some cases, the pericardial sac is incomplete and the diaphragm is rudimentary and in the form of a small fold projecting from the chest wall. Affected animals usually survive for a few hours to several weeks, although many can survive for years with the hernia being clinically inapparent. 1 In pigs, a number of animals in each litter can be affected.",

The third type, enzootic nasal granuloma (ENG), occurs commonly in southern Australia, less commonly in New Zealand, and is recorded as a sporadic disease in South America and an occasional disease in North America, Britain, and Europe. It is reported as a herd outbreak in Jersey cows in the United Kingdom. 3 Enzootic nasal granuloma occurs sporadically in some herds but may reach an incidence of 30%. In one area, as much as 75% of herds may have the disease. Animals aged between 6 months and 4 years are most commonly affected, and the chronic disease may or may not be preceded by an attack of acute rhinitis. Most cases commence in the summer and autumn months. It is apparent that nasal granuloma develops as a continuous and progressive response to acute episodes of hypersensitivity to an allergen present in the summer months. This accords with the gradual development of the stertorous respiration and the observations, in biopsies of nasal mucosa, of the presence of mast cells in all seasons, but the regression of eosinophils in the winter months.",

The disease is rare in cattle less than 1 year old, although it can occur at any age. Most affected animals are in feedlots on heavy-grain diets, and there are peaks of incidence at those times of the year when most cattle are on such diets. There is a relationship between the occurrence of this disease and that of hepatic abscessation arising from lactic-acid-induced rumenitis on heavy-grain diets. The disease is reported with deep digital sepsis in cattle. 1 A similar syndrome occurs in horses, although rarely. 2 The etiology and pathogenesis of the disease are based on the development of a thrombus in the posterior vena cava and the subsequent shedding of emboli that lodge in the pulmonary artery, causing embolism, endarteritis, multiple pulmonary abscesses, and chronic suppurative pneumonia. Pulmonary hypertension develops in the pulmonary artery, leading to the development of aneurysms, which can rupture causing massive intrapulmonary or intrabronchial hemorrhage. In most cases the thrombi in the vena cava originate from hepatic abscesses or postdiaphragmatic abscesses. Usually there is an initial phlebitis and the subsequent thrombus extends into the thoracic part of the vessel. When the thrombus occludes the openings of the hepatic veins into the vena cava, there is congestion of the liver and hepatomegaly, ascites, and abdominal distension in some of these cases.",

Although in most cases pneumonia is the obvious cause of the disease, determining the etiology is the major diagnostic problem. If lesions typical of any of the common diseases of the respiratory tract of cattle can be recognized clinically, like those of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), then on a clinical basis a specific diagnosis can be made. The affected group may be unweaned dairy heifers, weaned beef calves, or yearlings that have recently arrived in a feedlot; cattle that have been in the feedlot for varying periods of time; young growing cattle on summer pasture; mature cows that have recently been placed on a lush pasture; yearling or mature lactating dairy cattle; or a group of veal calves.

Despite of intensive research in the field the incidence of respiratory disease in cattle during the first year of life could not be controlled. The proportion of mortality of weaned dairy heifers attributable to respiratory disease increased from 34.8% of all deaths in 1991 to 46.5% in 2007. 2 The economic impact of respiratory disease on the U.S. beef industry is estimated to exceed $4 billion annually, including treatment cost, disease prevention, and production loss such as decreased growth performance. 3 Cattle with detectable lung lesions at slaughter on average had a reduced daily weight gain of 0.08 kg/d compared with cattle without lung lesions. Protracted effects of respiratory disease in dairy calves on milk production and fertility in later life are more difficult to estimate, but repeated incidences of respiratory disease in a dairy heifer were found to almost double the risk for not completing the first lactation. 4 The primary goal of the clinician must be to make the most accurate clinical diagnosis as rapidly as possible, based on the clinical and epidemiologic findings that are identifiable on the farm, preferably when examining the animals on the first visit. Giving a prognosis and the formulation of rational and economic treatment that will minimize morbidity and mortality are the next goals. In any group situation, mass medication of each incontact animal is a major consideration that will increase costs and must be balanced against the economic losses that might occur if all animals are not treated metaphylactically. The clinical management of the outbreak, which includes treatment of the obvious cases and the prevention of new cases if possible, is dependent in part on the diagnosis. However, differentiation between the diseases based on clinical findings can be unreliable, and it is usually necessary to begin antimicrobial therapy that will be effective against the bacterial pathogens most likely to be present. Even after intensive clinical and laboratory investigation, the specific etiology will often not be determined, and the clinician is left with a diagnosis of acute undifferentiated respiratory disease of cattle or bovine respiratory disease (BRD).",

Stress resulting from weaning, transportation, processing, crowding, or harsh weather is considered to be an important contributor to outbreaks of BRD. Studies exploring the effect of stress resulting from weaning and maternal separation showed that the viral-bacterial synergism was altered when weaning occurred at the time of a primary viral infection with BHV-1 followed by a secondary bacterial infection with M. haemolytica resulting in significantly increased mortality rates. 5 Similarly calves weaned immediately before transport to a feedlot developed significantly more UBRD compared with calves adapted to weaning for 45 days. 6 This suggests that identifying and avoiding environmental and management risk factors are crucial to control BRD outbreaks.",

The risk of fatal fibrinous pneumonia was consistently greater for calves entering the feedlot in November, shortly after the auction sales had peaked, when the feedlot was reaching capacity. Increased mixing at the auction markets was associated with increased fatal disease risk. The distance calves were transported by truck was not associated with fatal disease risk. When the incidence of fatal fibrinous pneumonia was high, the disease clustered within truckloads or pens.

Bovine respiratory disease in dairy heifers increases the risk of mortality directly after the disease episode by up to 6 times, reduces growth during the first 6 months of life by up to 10 kg, and increases the likelihood of dystocia after first calving.

In most cases, the thorax of these animals is not auscultated for evidence of pneumonia. Although a fever when combined with other clinical signs is a valuable parameter in the process of making a diagnosis, fever of undetermined origin can as well be unassociated with respiratory disease and does not imperatively require treatment. In a feedlot pen of 112 recently arrived bull calves that were fitted with reticuloruminal temperaturesensing boluses, a total of 449 fever episodes were recorded in 110 animals during the first 40 days after arrival. Of these fever episodes, 74% were not associated with any visually apparent clinical signs or respiratory disease, and 75% lasted for less than 48 hours. A negative effect on average daily weight gain of feverish animals with or without clinical signs was recorded with prolonged episodes of fever, with an approximate decrease of 33 g/day for each day of fever. 10 Because of the difficulty in identifying cattle with early stage respiratory disease in large feedlots, several advanced monitoring techniques have been developed and studied for their suitability to help making a rapid and accurate diagnosis in the field situation. The feeding and watering behavior of healthy and sick animals in a commercial feedlot has been examined using radiofrequency technology to record individual animal behaviors. Eating and drinking behaviors are associated with clinical signs of bovine respiratory disease, but there is no obvious predictive association between signs of bovine respiratory disease in recently arrived weaned beef calves and eating and drinking behavior. Calves that were sick had greater frequency and duration of drinking 4 to 5 days after arrival than calves that were not sick. Sick calves had significantly lower frequency and duration of eating and drinking 11 to 27 days after arrival but had greater frequency of eating 28 to 57 days after arrival than calves that were not sick. Calves at slaughter that had a higher percentage of lung tissue with lesions had lower frequency and duration of eating 11 to 27 days after arrival but had greater frequency and duration of eating 28 to 57 days after arrival. Experimentally, the electronic acquisition of feeding behavior data for feedlot cattle, when analyzed using cumulative sums (CUSUM) procedures, offers the potential for predicting morbidity before conventional visual methods of appraisal. The feeding behavior during the first 30 days when cattle are in a receiving pen may be used to detect animal morbidity approximately 4 days earlier than conventional methods typically employed in commercial feedlots. Overall accuracy, positive predictive value and sensitivity of the CUSUM prediction method were 87%, 91%, and 90%, respectively.",

This technology allows remote and continuous recording of the reticular temperature of animals fitted with a temperature-sensing bolus and permits the identification of animals with prolonged fever episodes not associated with apparent clinical signs and thereby potentially improves the sensitivity of the detection of animals with BRD in a field setting. 10 Prolonged fever episodes are certainly not always attributable to respiratory disease, but even when not associated with clinical signs, prolonged fever was found to negatively affect average daily weight gain. 10",

In contrast, the significance of bacterial isolates or negative test results must be interpreted cautiously. 12 Isolates of M. haemolytica from nasopharyngeal swabs were found to be highly representative for the isolates present in lung tissue in clinically affected animals. 13 However, because most bacterial pathogens of the lower respiratory tract such as M. haemolytica can be part of the normal upper respiratory flora, isolation of one or several of these agents from a nasopharyngeal swab does not necessarily indicate that it is the cause of disease. 14 Although isolation of M. bovis from a nasal swab confirms the presence of this pathogen in the herd, the association of the presence of M. bovis in the upper respiratory tract with clinical disease or its presence in the lower respiratory tract reported in the literature is more variable. Some authors reported that M. bovis is commonly found in the upper respiratory tract in healthy calves; however, this is not confirmed by others.

[17] [18] [19] [20] [21] Although increased concentrations of SAA and Hp in calves with BRD compared with healthy calves suggest that measuring the serum concentrations of these APPs could assist the early detection of calves with respiratory disease, the discriminative ability of Hp by itself for BRD was found to be no better than determination of the rectal temperature. 18 Haptoglobin concentrations vary considerably between calves even in healthy animals and were significantly affected by sex and rectal temperature. 18 The increase in serum Hp was found to occur within 24 hours of experimental challenge with M. haemolytica of BHV-1-infected calves but occurred between 4 and 8 days of infection with BRSV or BVD. For SAA, the wide variation between animals and the less pronounced increase in SAA concentration in animals suffering of respiratory disease impair the ability of this parameter to discriminate between healthy calves and animals affected by BRD. 20 Leukocyte counts are of little value as predictors of respiratory disease because leukocytosis and neutrophilia occur in some animals, but in others there may be a neutropenia or no significant change. 16 ",

Results of ultrasonographic examination of pneumonic calves were found to be highly correlated with the results of radiographic and postmortem examination. In contrast, the association between ultrasonographic findings and ancillary tests assessing lung and respiratory functions are less obvious. 25 Although the method was found a useful ancillary diagnostic tool to determine type and degree of pleural and pulmonary lesions, ultrasonography results were not found to be associated with animal health outcomes such as subsequent treatment, chronicity, wastage, or mortality. 26 More invasive diagnostic procedures such lung biopsies have been studied for their usefulness as ancillary diagnostic tool. Although easy to perform with minimal risk to the animal, this procedure was not found useful for characterizing early respiratory disease in feedlot cattle under field conditions. 27",

Simply dispensing antimicrobials to the owner without clinical examination of the animals is inadequate and contradicts the intention of the veterinarian-client relationship. The veterinarian is professionally obliged to provide explicit instructions about medication of affected animals and the drug withdrawal requirements and to keep adequate records of affected animals, treatments given, and the results of laboratory examinations. A final report should be prepared by the veterinarian and sent to the owner. \u2022 Increased surveillance of the group is required to detect affected animals as soon as clinical abnormalities, such as depression, nasal discharge, and dyspnea, are noticeable. \u2022 New cases must be treated as soon as they are detected. Each treated animal should be suitably identified and a record kept of the initial body temperature, the treatment administered and the instructions for follow-up treatment. Treatment failures and disease recurrence a few days after an initial apparent recovery are often attributable to late treatment. Delaying treatment until 48 hours after an experimental aerosol infection of M. haemolytica was found to prolong the course of the disease and increase mortality. \u2022 Unless otherwise determined, when toxemia, causing pyrexia and anorexia, is present a primary or secondary bacterial pneumonia should be suspected, in which case antimicrobial therapy is of prime importance. Antimicrobials should be administered parenterally at least initially. Treatment via medicated feed or water bears the risk of underdosage in anorectic animals that are most severely affected. The regular use of a particular antimicrobial in feedlots may increase the level of resistance to M. haemolytica. Antimicrobials commonly used for treatment of UBRD are summarized in the treatment box of this section. \u2022 Antiinflammatory therapy should routinely be combined with appropriate antimicrobial therapy in severe cases of BRD that are characterized by dyspnea, pyrexia, and anorexia. A beneficial response to therapy should be apparent within 12 to 24 hours. The body temperature should decline significantly, and the appearance of the animal and its appetite should improve. The response to treatment, or lack of it, is valuable information in making a final decision on cause. One of the emerging problems inherent in such broad policies in treatment is public health concern with the amount of antibiotic residue in meat, the spreading of resistance to antimicrobials, and the increased public awareness and concern about indiscriminate antibiotic use in food-producing animals. 30 Pressure is now being applied to use antimicrobials only when necessary, which necessitates a more accurate diagnosis.",

Some of the antimicrobials with a label for treatment of BRD, such as thirdand fourth-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones, are also classified as critically important for human an animal health and should therefore be used restrictively. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) issued following recommendations for these classes of antimicrobials: 31 \u2022 Not to be used as preventive treatment applied by feed or water in the absence of clinical signs \u2022 Not to be used as first-line treatment unless justified-when used in a second-line treatment, it should ideally be based on the results of bacteriologic tests. \u2022 Extra-label/off-label use should be limited and reserved for instances where no alternatives are available. Such use should be in agreement with the national legislature in force. A recent mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis of antibiotic treatments for BRD attempted a ranking of commonly used antimicrobials based on data published in over 90 publications. 32 Based on the publically available information, the authors estimated tulathromycin followed by enrofloxacin, danofloxacin, and florfenicol as the most effective antimicrobials for the treatment of BRD. Gamithromycin was estimated to be less effective but comparable to tilmicosin at label dose. Oxytetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfur, and ceftiofur injected at the base of the ear all ranked poorly in this analysis. For oxytetracycline, the retreatment risk was estimated to be between 64% and 77% and thus far above the risk calculated for other evaluated antimicrobials. 32 Antiinflammatory therapy was beneficial in cases of severe BRD that is characterized by marked dyspnea, fever, and feed-intake depression. The best established effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in animals suffering of BRD are a more rapid decline of the rectal temperature and faster return to normal feed and water intake. Long-term effects on clinical outcome, disease recurrence, and severity of chronic lung lesions reported in the literature are more variable. 33 The precise mechanism through which NSAIDs act in calves with respiratory disease is not entirely understood, but antiinflammatory properties improving respiratory gas exchange and antipyretic and analgesic properties improving the wellbeing and thereby feed and water consumption are believed to be of prime importance. Numerous studies documented a more pronounced improvement in the initial phase of the disease in calves treated with NSAIDs and antimicrobials compared with animals treated with antimicrobials alone, a finding that is significant from an animal welfare perspective. A recent survey among U.S. feedlots revealed that, on average, NSAIDs were part of the standard initial treatment for respiratory disease in 55.9% of all feedlots, whereas steroids were used in 30.9% of the surveyed U.S. feedlots. 1 Nevertheless, the veterinarian must be aware that the combination of antiinflammatory and antimicrobial therapy complicates the assessment of the antimicrobial effect that should take place no later than 48 hours after first treatment because clinical improvement cannot unequivocally be attributed to the susceptibility of the causative pathogen to the administered antimicrobial drug. Experimental and clinical evaluation of the role of corticosteroid therapy in acute pneumonia in cattle yielded mostly unfavorable results. 34 Steroids are powerful antiinflammatory agents, but their effects on the animal's defensive measures, specifically with repeated use, reduces the value of their use in syndromes of infectious origin unless they have a short duration of action. 35 ",

[39] [40] [41] The results obtained with long-acting oxytetracycline at a dose of 20 mg/kg BW or higher reported in the literature are more variable. 37 Although an economical advantage may result from the lower price of oxytetracycline compared with newer antimicrobials, morbidity rates were found to be higher with the use of oxytetracycline compared with tilmicosin. 37 The mass medication of feed supplies or water of newly arrived feedlot cattle has been investigated as a method of reducing the morbidity and mortality resulting from respiratory disease in a number of studies, but results are equivocal. Although studies suggesting that chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine in feed are effective in reducing morbidity associated with BRD have been published, issues around study design and data analysis questioned the validity of the results. 37 A standard recommendation is to provide 150 mg/kg BW for the first 24 hours and reduce the level to 75 mg/kg BW for the duration of the medication period, which may last 5 to 10 days.",

Some cattle will be highly susceptible and others relatively resistant because of differences in nasal flora and immunologic, genetic, and nutritional backgrounds. A high level of management and constant surveillance are necessary to recognize, isolate, and treat clinical cases early to minimize morbidity and case mortality. \u2022 Rapid fluctuations in environmental temperatures and relative humidity, not only during the fall and winter months but also during warm seasons, will commonly precede outbreaks of respiratory diseases. Every practical and economical management technique must be used to provide as much comfort as possible and to avoid overcrowding. \u2022 Inadequate ventilation is a major predisposing cause of respiratory disease of cattle raised indoors. This is of major importance in dairy herds during the winter months in temperate climates. \u2022 Weaning calves 3 weeks or longer before sale was found to be beneficial for later development and animal health in several studies. 37 \u2022 Weaning of beef calves during inclement weather may exacerbate the stress of weaning and commonly results in an outbreak of respiratory disease. \u2022 Stress associated with the marketing of cattle is a major factor. The movement of cattle through saleyards-where they may be overcrowded; mixed with cattle of many different origins; temporarily deprived of adequate feed and water; handled roughly while being sorted, weighed, tagged, blood sampled, vaccinated, or injected with antibiotics and/or vitamins, and then loaded on to uncomfortable vehicles and transported long distances without adequate rest stops-is stressful. The practice of preconditioning cattle before they enter the feedlot must continue to be examined to determine which aspects are most profitable. Presale vaccination programs are designed to establish an effective immune response to common respiratory tract pathogens well in advance of any natural exposure that may occur while calves travel through the auction market or after they arrive in the feedlot. These programs usually require calves to be castrated, dehorned, and vaccinated against BHV-1, PI-3V, BRSV, and BVDV. Some programs also require vaccination against H. somni and M. haemolytica. Presale conditioning programs involve these procedures but also include weaning and nutritional components. Most such conditioning programs require calves to be weaned and adjusted to a roughage and concentrate diet for at least 30 days before sale.",

M. haemolytica of the order Pasteurellaceae, a gram-negative coccobacillus is considered the most important bacterial pathogen in weaned calves, whereas Pasteurella multocida is more commonly isolated from the lower respiratory tract of younger calves with respiratory disease. 1 There are currently 12 recognized serotypes of M. hameolytica (A1, A2, A5, A6, A7, A8, A9, A12, A13, A14, A16, and A17), of which serotype A2 and to a lesser extent A4 are commonly isolated from the upper respiratory tract of healthy ruminants and thus are considered normal inhabitants of the nasopharynx and tonsils of ruminants. Serotypes A1 and, more recently, A6 are most commonly associated with respiratory disease in cattle. 2, 3 Pasteurella multocida has 5 capsular serogroups (A, B, D, E, and F) and 16 somatic serotypes (1-16). Whereas P. multocida serotypes B and E are associated with hemorrhagic septicemia in cattle and water buffaloes in tropical regions, serotype A3 and, to a lesser extent, D3 are the major pathogens associated with lower respiratory tract infection in cattle. 4 Clearly, the presence of P. multocida in the upper respiratory tract does not equal disease because of the ubiquitous nature of this organism, but the proportion of fatal cases of shipping fever attributable to P. multocida appears to be increasing, according to the recent literature. 4 The Pasteurella spp. are opportunistic pathogens and the final cause of the pneumonia but rely on predisposing mechanisms allowing the bacteria to enter and colonize the lung and produce the lesions.

The presence of antibody indicates current or recent exposure to the virus but does not indicate resistance. Cattle with low titers to BHV-1 or BRSV were at increased risk of subsequent treatment for bovine respiratory disease. Treated cattle also had greater increases to PI-3V and/or BVDV antibodies than control calves. Although there is evidence that BVDV can experimentally affect certain immune mechanisms, there is little direct evidence that the virus is a major predisposing factor in the causation of naturally occurring pneumonic pasteurellosis. Seroepidemiologic surveys indicate that seroconversion to BVDV is related to increased risk of respiratory disease at both individual and group levels. Serologically, there is also evidence of a high prevalence of M. bovis and M. dispar in feedlot calves. But the relative importance of these pathogens as a cause and effect relationship is controversial. Bovine coronavirus has been associated with some natural outbreaks of shipping fever in feedlot cattle. Up to 80% of affected animals shed bovine coronavirus from their nasal cavities when the infection rate with Pasteurella spp. was low.",

[14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] Although increased concentrations of SAA and Hp in calves with BRD compared with healthy calves suggest that measuring the serum concentrations of these APPs could assist the early detection of calves with respiratory disease, the discriminative ability of Hp by itself for BRD was found to be no better than determination of the rectal temperature. 15 The concentration of Hp varies considerably between calves even in healthy animals and is significantly affected by sex and rectal temperature. 15 The increase in serum Hp was found to occur within 24 hours of experimental challenge with M. haemolytica of BHV-1 infected calves but occurred between 4 and 8 days of infection with BRSV or BVDV. For SAA the wide variation between animals and the less pronounced increase in SAA concentration in animals suffering of BRD impairs the ability of this parameter to discriminate between healthy calves and animals affected by BRD. 17 Leukocyte and differential cell counts are of little value as predictors of respiratory disease because leukocytosis and neutrophilia occur in some animals, but in others there may be a neutropenia or no significant change.",

The rationale is that the medication of the feed or water would successfully abort an outbreak by treating those animals incubating the disease, provide convalescent therapy to those that have already been treated individually, and deal with mild cases before they become acutely ill and need individual treatment. However, there are problems. The amount of water that cattle drink is directly proportional to feed consumption. If they are inappetent or anorexic, water consumption will decline to only maintenance requirements, and therapeutic levels of drug will not be achieved if the concentration in the water is provided at a level for normal consumption. The other major problem is the provision of a uniform concentration of drug in the water supply, either through automatic water proportioners in the waterline or placing the drug directly into water tanks. Both can be unreliable. The mass medication of feed supplies or water of newly arrived feedlot cattle has been investigated as a method of reducing the morbidity and mortality as a result of respiratory disease in a number of studies, but results are equivocal. Although studies suggesting that chlortetracycline and sulfamethazine in feed are effective in reducing morbidity associated with BRD in calves have been published, issues around study design and data analysis questioned the validity of the results. 23",

The best established effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in animals suffering of respiratory disease are a more rapid decline of the rectal temperature and faster return to normal feed and water intake. Long-term effects on clinical outcome, disease recurrence, and severity of chronic lung lesions reported in the literature are more variable. 24 The precise mechanism through which NSAIDs act in calves with respiratory disease is not entirely understood, but antiinflammatory properties improving respiratory gas exchange and antipyretic and analgesic properties improving the well-being and thereby feed and water consumption are believed to be of prime importance. 25 Numerous studies documented a more pronounced improvement in the initial phase of the disease in calves treated with NSAIDs and antimicrobials compared with animals treated with antimicrobials alone, a finding that is significant from an animal welfare perspective. Notwithstanding the veterinarian must be aware that this combination treatment complicates the assessment of the antimicrobial effect that should take place 48 hours after first treatment, as clinical improvement cannot unequivocally be attributed to the susceptibility of the causative pathogen to the administered antimicrobial drug. Experimental and clinical evaluation of the role of corticosteroid therapy in acute pneumonia in cattle yielded mostly unfavorable results. 26 Steroids are powerful antiinflammatory agents, but their effects on the animal's defensive measures, specifically with repeated use, reduces the value of their use in syndromes of infectious origin unless they have a short duration of action. 27 A recent survey among U.S. feedlots revealed that on average NSAIDs were part of the standard initial treatment for respiratory disease in 55.9% of all feedlots, whereas steroids were used in 30.9% of the surveyed U.S. feedlots. 5",

This led to the development in North America of the concept of preconditioning. The objective of preconditioning was to prepare the weaned calf for the feedlot environment by vaccinating it for all the commonly anticipated diseases before weaning and distributing all stressful procedures such as castration, dehorning, branding, and deworming over a period of time rather than concentrating these at weaning time. Weaning at least 2 weeks before shipment is considered as one of the most desirable preconditioning practices. This was to result in a weaned calf that could be moved into a feedlot in which the feed bunks and water bowls would not be strange but familiar and the calf would adjust quickly. The most common vaccinations were for BHV-1, PI-3V, BVDV, BRSV, and clostridial disease. In some situations, calves were also vaccinated for H. somni and against pneumonic pasteurellosis.",

Following such a weaning program, the calves require only a minimum of adjustment; the only adjustment necessary should be to the loss of their dams. Recently weaned calves should be observed at least twice daily for evidence of respiratory disease and treated promptly if necessary. They should not be transported long distances until they appear to be healthy and are eating liberal quantities of hay and drinking water normally. During transportation liberal quantities of bedding are necessary, and cattle should not be without feed and water for more than 24 to 30 hours. For long trips, calves should be rested for 8 to 12 hours and fed water and hay at intervals of 24 hours.

According to a large recent survey conducted in the United States, BVD vaccines are used in 96.6%, BHV-1 vaccines in 93.7%, BRSV vaccines in 89.5%, and PI-3 vaccines in 85.1% of surveyed feedlots to control BRD. 5 The use of vaccines against pasteurellas (63.8%) and Histophilus somni (69.7%) is less common. Notwithstanding the evidence of efficacy for this practice is equivocal at best. A review of the literature in 1997 on the efficacy of the vaccines available for the control of bovine respiratory disease concluded that there were few documented data to support the use of vaccines against respiratory disease under feedlot conditions. Since that time progress has been made in understanding immunity to pneumonic pasteurellosis, and some vaccines with varying degrees of efficacy have been developed. Various commercial vaccines differ in the rapidity and intensity of serum antibody responses to M. haemolytica whole cells and leukotoxin. Although the vaccines have been evaluated by experimental challenge of vaccinated animals with specific pathogens in a laboratory environment, there is little scientific evidence available that the vaccines are protective against bovine respiratory pasteurellosis as it occurs in the real-world situation. 23 Respiratory vaccines have consistently resulted in antibody production against the specific antigen, but obtained titers did frequently not protect against respiratory disease. Failures of vaccination can certainly not exclusively be attributed to the vaccines themselves. Factors such as timing of vaccination or animal stress hampering the immune response to vaccination are likely to contribute to the poor vaccine performance. 23 Optimal vaccine response can only be expected in a fully immunocompetent animal, takes 2 to 3 weeks to develop, and may require multiple doses of vaccine to elicit protective immunity. 28 ",

Cattle that have recovered from the natural disease are resistant to the disease. The challenge in the development of an efficacious vaccine against pneumonic pasteurellosis has been to determine the most effective protective antigens of the organism. Several different Pasteurella vaccines have been developed based on the virulence factors, including leukotoxin, lipopolysaccharides, capsular polysaccharides, and outer membrane proteins. Each of the vaccines produced may provide some protection against experimental and naturally occurring disease, but none provides a high degree of protection. Modified live and killed vaccines are currently available. Live streptomycindependent P. multocida vaccines have been associated with improved health and weightgain performance compared with unvaccinated calves in some studies. Killed pasteurella vaccines did not show significant effects on morbidity, mortality, or extent of pulmonary damage and even were reported to result in increased morbidity in some cases. 29 Leukotoxin Extract Vaccine High leukotoxin-neutralizing antibody titers induced by natural infections have been associated with reduced susceptibility to pneumonic pasteurellosis.

M. ovipneumoniae, although in low numbers, is frequently isolated from the upper respiratory tract of healthy sheep, which may act as source of infection to young lambs. A high prevalence of M. ovipneumoniae in association with M. haemolytica in lung tissue of lambs has been reported from Turkey and more recently from Italy. 2 Lambs get infected during the first days of life but usually do not show clinical signs before 5 or 10 weeks of age. Clinical disease is commonly triggered by stress, inclement weather, or a secondary bacterial infection. 3 The clinical presentation can vary from mildly affected dull lambs with increased respiratory rate, coughing, increased rectal temperature, anorexia, and poor growth to severely affected animals with acute fibrinous pneumonia, lung consolidation, pleuritis, and pulmonary abscesses formation. Most commonly the disease results in chronic, persistent, and irregular cough, with mucopurulent nasal discharge. 3 Treatment with fluoroquinolones, tetracyclines, or macrolid antibiotics often results in a rapid improvement that is followed by a relapse once the treatment is discontinued.",

            "text": "in Africa during the second half of the past century, and several outbreaks have been recorded in southern Europe until the end of last century. Reasons behind the failure to contain CBPP in Africa include the following: 4, 5 \u2022 Changes of ecological/ environmental factors, such as availability of water, droughts, and floods, leading to increased movement of livestock over long distances \u2022 Civil strife and political and economic difficulties complicating the strict movement control of apparently infected cattle \u2022 Lack or insufficient resources allocated to CBPP control, particularly limited funding for vaccination, livestock movement control, and mass education of farmers and veterinarians \u2022 Limited potency and field performance of CBPP vaccines \u2022 Reduced disease surveillance (e.g., serologic screening and abattoir studies) \u2022 Distraction by control and prevention of other economically important diseases (e.g., rinderpest or avian influenza) Historically CBPP spread throughout the European continent during the eighteenth century through uncontrolled movement of livestock caused by transhumance and wars. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the disease was introduced into the United States, Asia, Australia, and Japan. CBPP was first introduced into Africa through an infected Holstein Friesian bull imported from the Netherlands to South Africa in 1854. 4 From there the disease spread to other South African countries, causing the death of over 100,000 cattle. 6 By 1939 the disease was eradicated in most South African countries but not in war-torn Angola and Namibia, where it still remains a threat for neighboring disease-free countries. 6 CBPP was reported from 27 African countries between 1995 and 2002, of which 13 were in West Africa, two in Central Africa, six in East Africa and the remainder in South Africa. 3 In East Africa CBPP is endemic in Burundi, Rwanda, large parts of Tanzania, southern Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia. 3, 7, 8 Guinea, Mali, Niger, and Mauritania are endemically infected countries in West Africa and Angola and Zambia in the South African region. 3 Numerous epidemic outbreaks of the disease, spreading from endemic neighboring regions through livestock movement have been reported, including Burundi and Zambia in 1997, Tanzania in 1996 and 1999, and Botswana in 1995 and 1998. 3, 9 The infection prevalence varies considerably in endemic regions of the world. Whereas a seroprevalence of 8% of the cattle population has been reported in Sudan, prevalence rates in the range of 25% have been given for Ethiopia, Chad, Guinea, and Tanzania. For Burkina Faso and Uganda, prevalence rates below 5% have been reported. 3 In Asia, CBPP has been reported from Assam in India, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. Sporadic outbreaks have been recognized in the Middle East, probably derived from importation of cattle from Africa. The latest Asian outbreaks reported to the OIE occurred in Mongolia, India, and Pakistan in 1973, 1990, and 1997 respectively. 10 In China CBPP first occurred at the beginning of the twentieth century through livestock shipments from Australia. 10 In the early 1950s China implemented its first control measures, including a vaccination program, after having suffered severe economic damage from the plague. The country declared itself free of CBPP in 1996 and is currently officially recognized as CBPP-free by the OIE. 11 The disease was introduced into Australia in 1858 by dairy cattle imported from England into the colony of Victoria. It spread rapidly throughout Australia by cattle being driven to take up new pastoral lands everywhere, aided by the bullock teams, which provided the only form of transportation of goods and supplies in those days. In 1958 a national eradication campaign was commenced. Australia was declared free from the disease 1973.",

Although the disease could be rapidly controlled in France and Spain, recurrent outbreaks occurred in Portugal until the end of last century. Italy, which had been free of the disease since 1899, saw an outbreak of CBPP between 1990 and 1993 that could never be traced back to its source. Within these 3 years the disease spread over an area 59 km 2 , affecting nearly 100 cattle herds and requiring the slaughter of over 24 000 cattle. The disease was eradicated in 1993. The last reported outbreak in Europe occurred in northern Portugal in 1999. As of 2004, Europe is free from CBPP and the European Union rules prevent the importation of live animals from affected areas. A recent phylogenetic analysis indicated all MmmSC strains isolated in Europe since 1980 were derived from a common ancestor, suggesting that a single strain may have spread, largely unnoticed, in southern Europe between 1980 and 1993. 12",

Renal lesions are not uncommon and large numbers of viable MmmSC are passed in the urine of infected animals, and inhalation of urine droplets may be a route of infection.

For these reasons it is suggested that the organism is a poor immunogen, which may account for the frequent lack of good circulating antibody responses in experimentally infected and vaccinated cattle.

The disease is an acute lobar pneumonia and pleurisy. The organism invades the lungs of cattle and causes a mycoplasmemia; this results in localization in numerous other sites including the kidneys, joints and brain, resulting in high morbidity and mortality. An essential part of the pathogenesis of the disease is thrombosis in the pulmonary vessels, probably before the development of pneumonic lesions. The mechanism of development of the thrombosis is not understood, but there is no general increase in blood coagulability and no generalized tendency to spontaneous thrombosis.",

Nevertheless, the use of antimicrobials in affected regions is widespread, mainly because, with limited availability of vaccines, it is considered the only available and effective treatment and control measure. 5, 19 In recent years the popularity of antibiotic treatment and the perception of positive results led to some research activity suggesting that antimicrobial use may be of value primarily to control disease transmission. 5 Despite the perception of veterinarians and farmers that antibiotics can alleviate the clinical course of the disease, enabling some improvement in condition, field studies suggest that antimicrobial therapy had little to no effect on severity of signs, course of the disease, and mortality rate in clinically affected animals. 20, 21 Treatment failures in clinically affected animals may be attributable to inadequate dosage or duration of treatment and to the chronic nature of the condition. Treatment success of antimicrobial therapy to treat mycoplasma infection greatly depends on a timely initiation of the treatment, but clinically affected animals in endemic areas frequently are in an advanced or even chronic stage of disease and thus are unlikely to show strong treatment response. 21 Because of the generally poor treatment response and because these animals present a source of infection for herdmates, clinically affected animals should rather be culled than treated.",

Although CBPP vaccination is doomed to fail when used as stand-alone strategy to control CPBB, a systematic vaccination strategy in combination with intense surveillance and removal of infected animals can contribute to the containment of the disease and reduction of the infection prevalence to the point where vaccination can be discontinued and remaining infected animals can be culled to achieve complete eradication of the disease. 3, 25 Extensive vaccination in Australia reduced the incidence of the disease to an extremely low level, and complete eradication of the disease was achieved shortly afterward. Vaccine application is usually controlled by local legislation. All effective CBPP vaccines have been based upon live versions of the diseasecausing MmmSC, either attenuated or not. Currently the only vaccines in use are live vaccine derived from the T1 strain (T1/44 and T1SR) of live attenuated Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC and attenuated through repeated passage in embryonated eggs before production in artificial growth media. 26 Unfortunately these vaccines are characterized by poor and variable efficacy, with only between 30% and 60% of vaccinated animals being protected. In some situations, the T1/44 vaccine induces a good immunity, especially when herds are revaccinated annually, in which case the level of protection exceeds 85%. Induced immunity is short lived, particularly for the T1SR strain, requiring revaccination at least on a yearly basis. Either systemic or local adverse reactions are common, particularly for the T1/44 strain. Within 2 to 4 weeks following injection, an invading edema develops known as the \"Willems\" reaction. The incidence of these reactions varies from area to another. The reversion to virulence of the T1/44 vaccine has also been observed when it was serially passaged by endobronchial intubation resulting in the development of lesions of CBPP in animals that were infectious to in-contact animals. This suggests that animals given the currently used vaccines (T1/44 and T1SR) subcutaneously could be reservoirs for MmmSC and infect other animals in areas previously free of CBPP.",

Despite the ban, the use of antimicrobials is widespread mainly because vaccine coverage vaccine efficacy is limited. 5, 15 Recent field trials and epidemiologic studies provided evidence corroborating the empirical observation that the use of antimicrobials in infected herds is able to contain disease transmission. 5,15,21 Using a homogeneous model based on publically available data, one study concluded that the potential impact of reducing the infectious period by the use of antimicrobials on disease persistence and mortality was in the same range as the impact of currently available vaccines. 25 In single isolated herds of 500 head of cattle, a 50% reduction in length of the infectious period caused the fade-out of the disease in essentially 100% of herds, a 60% decline in the number of cases, and a 73% decline in mortality. 25 Accordingly a significant decline in mortality, seropositivity, frequency of morphologic lesions, and severity of clinical scores was observed in herds where all incontact animals received a treatment with danofloxacin at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg on 3 consecutive days compared with untreated herds. 21 This mounting body of evidence warrants the reconsideration of the use of antimicrobials in an CBPP eradication or control program.",

In England and Wales, serologic screening between 2000 and 2009 revealed a herd seroprevalence of M. bovis of over 30% and M. bovis was isolated on average in 40% of pneumonic lungs submitted during that time period. 2 In Israel, M. bovis was isolated from 26% to 65% of samples from pneumonic calves submitted between 2004 and 2008. 3 M. bovis was also the strain isolated from more than half of the 1000 samples from calves with bronchopneumonia that were submitted to different diagnostic laboratories in France between 2003 and 2008. 2 In a recent Italian study, 37% of lung tissue samples from pneumonic dairy calves less than 1 month old submitted to a diagnostic laboratory tested positive on PCR for Mycoplasma spp. Of the positive samples, 31% were identified as M. bovis. 4 The chronic pneumonia and polyarthritis syndrome (CPPS) of feedlot cattle has been reported in Canada and the United States. It occurs commonly in young feedlot cattle usually affecting many animals a few weeks after arrival and mingling in the lot. In Canada, the disease has been seen commonly in young cattle (6-8 months of age) following shipment from western rangelands to eastern feedlots, which suggests that long transportation and mixing of cattle of different origins may be important epidemiologic characteristics. The morbidity ranges from 20% to 85% and the case-mortality rate from 3% to 50%. Calves affected with arthritis commonly have necropsy evidence of mycoplasmal pneumonia, and it is proposed that the pneumonia precedes the development of the arthritis. In feedlot calves the prevalence of M. bovis infection was found to be below 7% at the time animals enter the feedlot but increases dramatically within to first weeks in the feedlot to values between 40% and 100% in most studies. 5 In a group of feedlot cattle, from Alberta, Canada, with chronic unresponsive pneumonia and polyarthritis, M. bovis was the most common pathogen isolated, having been detected in 82% of cases, including 71% in lungs and 45% in joints. In a series of cases of chronic, antibiotic-resistant pneumonia, sometimes with concurrent polyarthritis, in feedlot cattle in western Canada, M. bovis was present in the lung tissues of more than 90% of cases, and the BVDV was present in 60% of the cases, suggesting a possible synergism between M. bovis and the BVDV. Outbreaks of pneumonia and arthritis in beef calves associated with infection attributable to Mycoplasma bovis and Mycoplasma californicum have been described in a mixed dairy cattle and beef cattle herd kept under extremely poor housing and hygienic conditions. Mycoplasma arthritis of cattle has been reported in a number of countries including Canada, the United States, several European countries and the United Kingdom. Commonly, arthritis occurs in association with respiratory disease or otitis media in calves, or mastitis in adult cattle, and it is proposed that the pneumonia precedes the development of the arthritis. Calves suckling cows with experimental mastitis attributable to this organism may develop mycoplasmal arthritis, and a high incidence is recorded in calves in dairy herds where mycoplasmal mastitis was occurring. In Ireland, infection has occurred in housed adult dairy cattle, without any evidence of pneumonia, producing severe polyarthritis with a clinical incidence in 12 farms that varied from 2% to 66%.",

The chronicity and poor treatment response of most diseases associated with M. bovis contribute considerably to these expenses.

Nasal, nasopharyngeal or conjunctival swabs, bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL), and transtracheal washes (TTW) are the most commonly used procedures to detect M. bovis in living animals. Nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs are frequently used under field conditions because this procedure is technically less demanding and less invasive than a TTW or BAL. Although presence of M. bovis on swab material is useful to confirm the presence of the pathogen in a herd, the diagnostic value on an individual animal level is limited because of the high occurrence of upper respiratory tract infection with M. bovis in clinically healthy cattle of infected herds. Comparison of paired culture results from nasopharyngeal swabs and BAL samples in cattle with respiratory disease indicate that the correlation between the presence of M. bovis in the upper respiratory tract and its presence in the lower respiratory tract or clinical disease is poor. 1 In contrast, excellent agreement between paired BAL fluid samples and corresponding tissue cultures obtained during necropsy have been reported, suggesting that samples collected from the lower respiratory tract such as BAL or TTW fluid are better suited to make a diagnosis on an individual animal. 1 When using swabs, wooden cotton swabs should be avoided because they can inhibit growth of mycoplasma. 11 The tip of the swab should be inserted approximately to the height of the medial canthus of the eye and must be firmly rotated against the mucosa to harvest many cells to which mycoplasmas are adhered. Swabs should then be stored in aerobic bacterial or mycoplasma transport media. Samples submitted for culture must either be kept refrigerated when shipping time does not exceed 24 hours or otherwise frozen. Because prolonged frozen storage significantly decreases the isolation of M. bovis, storage time should not exceed 7 to 10 days. 1 Tissue samples can be formalin-fixed when used for histology and IHC or must be placed on ice and transported to the diagnostic laboratory immediately for culture. 11",

Limited drug distribution into infected caseous lung tissue where M. bovis is present in largest numbers and the fibrin deposition and biofilm production that characterizes some M. bovis strains all contribute to resistance to antimicrobials in vivo that may contrast in vitro susceptibility. 2 Mycoplasmas have a theoretical susceptibility to antimicrobials that disrupt protein or DNA synthesis, such as tetracyclines, macrolides, florfenicol, and fluoroqinolones. In contrast they are inherently resistant to all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics because they lack a cell wall and to sulfonamides because they do not produce folic acid. Although a large number of studies document the efficacy of different antimicrobials for treatment of cattle experimentally infected with M. bovis, little information is available about treatment efficacy under field conditions. Several antimicrobials, including tylosin, oxytetracycline, lincomycin, spectinomycine, and oleandomycin, have been used in the past to treat naturally occurring M. bovis infection and were reported to result in clinical improvement. However, because of the common resistance of M. bovis against most of these antimicrobials that has been documented in recent years, these substances can no longer be considered appropriate choices. 1, 2 The published results of in vitro antimicrobial testing of isolates of M. bovis recovered from various locations are highly variable. The antimicrobial susceptibility of M. bovis strains, cultured from cases of pneumonia, arthritis, and mastitis of cattle, measured in vitro indicate that enrofloxacin, florfenicol, and spectinomycin all exhibited good to excellent activity. 18 The in vitro susceptibilities of Belgian field isolates of M. bovis to 10 antimicrobials found that tiamulin was the most active against the organism. The fluoroquinolones, danofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and marbofloxacin were effective against strains of M. bovis, whereas gentamicin was ineffective. In a series of British isolates of M. bovis, most isolates were susceptible to danofloxacin but less susceptible to florfenicol. An industry sponsored study found tulathromycin and florfenicol at label dose to be effective for the treatment of respiratory disease in cattle caused among others by M. bovis under field conditions. 19 Gamithromycin at label dose was found to be effective in treating naturally occurring clinical pneumonia caused by M. bovis. 20 In calves with a high incidence of respiratory disease associated with M. bovis and Pasteurella spp. the use of valnemulin in the milk of the calves for 4 days resulted in improved weight gains and fewer cases of mycoplasmal infection and required fewer treatments with antibiotics than those in the placebo treated group.",

The rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, reoviruses, and enteroviruses were also isolated but in much lower frequency, and were considered not to be important. Chlamydia spp. has been associated with respiratory disease in calves and usually as part of a mixed infection with viruses and bacteria. A recent metagenomics study identified the presence of bovine adenovirus, bovine rhinitis A virus, and bovine influenza D virus either alone or in combination in 62% of calves with respiratory disease. 5 Bibersteinia trahalosi (formerly P. haemolytica Biotype T) has been infrequently isolated from young dairy calves and adult cows with respiratory disease. It is currently uncertain whether B. trahalosi acts as a primary respiratory pathogen in bovine respiratory disease or plays a secondary and opportunistic role. Calves challenge exposed with a virulent isolate of B. trahalosi and previously vaccinated with a modified live leukotoxin positive M. haemolytica vaccine had less severe clinical signs of respiratory disease, lower mortality, and reduced lung lesions scores than unvaccinated calves. 7 In contrast, intratracheal inoculation of 2-to 3-month-old dairy calves with leukotoxin positive or negative strains of B. trahalosi failed to induce clinical signs of respiratory disease. 8 Interestingly, B. trahalosi inhibits the growth of M. haemolytica via a proximitydependent mechanism, 9 leading to speculation that most of the pathology in field cases attributed to B. trahalosi pneumonia was actually attributable to M. haemolytica infection that has been overgrown. Additional studies are needed to clarify the role of B. trahalosi in bovine respiratory disease.",

The calving area and environment can affect calf health through stress and the degree of exposure to infectious agents. Inadequate ventilation, improper climate control, and poorly constructed facilities can induce stress in calves. Crowding results in close contact and promotes spread of infection, and also results in excess moisture that, in the presence of inadequate ventilation (movement of air) and supplemental heat, causes a high relative humidity and chilling of calves. Many calf barns are old, adapted barns that are occupied for several months without depopulation and disinfection. Monitoring 48 dairy herds over 1 year in the National Animal Health Monitoring System revealed that mortality was lower in herds that used calf hutches compared with those that did not.

Attempts to correlate meteorologic data with the daily morbidity rate have not yet provided evidence for the hypothesis that climatic factors have an influence on incidence. This may be because of the difficulties associated with accurately monitoring meteorologic data, and the lack of a direct relationship between the environment outside a calf barn and the microclimate of the calf inside the barn.

To achieve these environmental conditions requires a suitable insulation material in the walls and ceilings, ample bedding to absorb moisture from feces and urine, and adequate movement of air to remove aerosol particles that may be infectious. This requires an adequate air inlet and outlet system, adequate capacity fans, and supplemental heat during very cold periods. The installation of recirculating air filter units can lead to a substantial reduction in the concentration of airborne bacteria to which calves are exposed. Field studies in veal calf units indicate that mean aerial bacteria concentration in filtered barns can be reduced by 45%, the number of calves requiring treatment reduced by 19%, the number of repeat courses of treatment and the total antibiotic usage reduced by 29% and 35%, respectively.

There is a clear association between low levels of IgG 1 , IgG 2 and IgA of calves at 2 to 3 weeks of age, and subsequent susceptibility to pneumonia at 2 to 3 months of age. Calves with signs of pneumonia had low levels of IgG 1 compared with nonpneumonic calves that had relatively higher levels. In addition, calves with high levels of serum immunoglobulin do not respond normally to vaccine and any vaccine for enzootic pneumonia would have to be administered during this relatively refractory period. However, for veal calves, which are purchased at a few days of age and with low levels of immunoglobulin, this may not be a problem. A 2015 metaanalysis concluded that in natural exposure trials, 2-week-old to 4-month-old dairy calves vaccinated with commercially available vaccines against BHV-1, BVDV, BRSV, and PI-3 for protection against respiratory disease had no reduction in morbidity or mortality compared with age-matched unvaccinated controls. 24 Vaccines currently available for BoCV are only licensed to control neonatal diarrhea in calves. Their efficacy in controlling respiratory disease is unknown but is likely to be poor. This is because respiratory isolates belong to subclades 2a, 2b, and 2c, whereas enteric isolates and a vaccine strain for control of enteric disease in calves belong to the antigenically different clade 1. 25 The intranasal inoculation of calves with virulent or a modified strain of PI-3 virus stimulates the development of both serum antibody and nasal secretion antibody. The nasal secretion antibody is dose dependent. Challenge exposure of these calves provides protection against clinical disease. These factors should be considered in the development and administration of PI-3 viral vaccines if the objective is to establish an optimal concentration of antibody in the nasal secretion. The parenteral administration of two sequential doses, 2 weeks apart, of an inactivated PI-3 virus vaccine with adjuvant will induce high levels of serum antibody and prevent virus excretion in nasopharyngeal secretions after challenge. Successful immunization of calves against PI-3 infection may be useful for protection against pneumonic pasteurellosis if PI-3 precedes the bacterial infection. This is presented in greater detail in the section on pneumonic pasteurellosis. A single dose of an experimental vaccine for M. bovis pneumonia, inactivated with saponin, given subcutaneously to 3-to 4-week-old calves followed by experimental challenge 3 weeks later with a virulent strain of M. bovis provided protection against clinical pneumonia. Unvaccinated calves developed clinical signs of disease as a result of lung lesions. The vaccine also reduced the spread of M. bovis to internal organs. Calves tested 6 months after immunization had high levels of humoral immunity. The successful use of saponin in vaccines has been demonstrated for other mycoplasma infections. such as contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (CCPP) and contagious agalactia. The saponin may preserve the major antigens seen in untreated whole cells. BRSV is genetically and antigenically related to human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). Other pneumoviruses include ovine respiratory syncytial virus (ORSV) and caprine respiratory syncytial virus (CRSV), with BRSV being most closely related to CRSV. BRSV provides a good model for HRSV, and consequently many studies related to identifying virulence factors and understanding the immunopathogenicity of BRSV infection have been conducted.",

In endemic areas, the absence of BRSV-associated disease in adult cattle is possibly as a result of repeated infections. This places a constraint on vaccine development because one or two vaccinations would have to induce immunity that only repeated natural infections can provide. BRSV infections can occur in the presence of high to moderate levels of maternal antibodies. Maternal antibodies, which are directed against the F, G, and N proteins of BRSV, are commonly present in calves but do not protect against infection. However, the incidence and severity are inversely related to the level of specific maternal antibody, and natural infection does not prevent reinfection but appears to offer good protection against clinical disease after infection. Primary BRSV infections in calves less than 1 month of age are less severe than those in calves 2 to 4 months of age, probably as a result of decreased proinflammatory TNF-\u03b1 production in calves less than 1 month of age. 5 The BRSV colostral antibody of dairy calves varies dependent on season of the year when the calves are born. Dairy calves born during the winter months in the Netherlands have lower BRSV colostral antibody titers than those born during the summer months. Whether this may be attributable to the seasonal periodicity of BRSV circulation or to other factors influencing antibody development or colostrum intake is uncertain. Calves born in the summer have higher antibody titers at 14 to 19 weeks of age, most likely attributable to BRSV exposure. Calves born during the season of infection may be primed with BRSV field virus during the period of maternally derived immunity and may be better protected against disease by cellular immunity during the next season of infection.",

The IgM and IgA antibodies are not involved in a hypersensitivity reaction. In experimentally induced infection in calves, there is considerable injury to bronchiolar epithelium including hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and formation of syncytia, which facilitates movement of virus between cells. 1 In the alveoli, BRSV infection results in necrosis of type I pneumocytes; the response of type II pneumocytes includes hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and syncytial formation.

In a series of naturally occurring paroxystic respiratory disease in calves, paired serum samples were taken 3 weeks apart and lungs examined at necropsy. The serum concentration of tryptase was used as a marker of mast cell degranulation. Tryptase is a preformed serine protease stored in mast cell granules and causes significant changes in the respiratory tract smooth muscle tone and vascular permeability. The substances released by the mast cells are at least partially responsible for the pulmonary edema, in particular by means of venoconstriction and the increase in the vascular permeability induced by the histamine. The edema and bronchoconstriction caused by the mast cell leukotrienes impede bronchiolar flow, which causes ventilatory asynchronism. The mechanical constraints caused by the asynchronism are aggravated because the bovine lungs consist of a number of compartments, which prevents any collateral ventilation and any dissipation of interlobular pressure gradients.

Syncytia are often observed in the bronchiolar walls and in the alveoli, and such syncytia were always replicating the virus. However, syncytial cell formation is not unique to infection with BRSV because it may also occur in other viral infections of the lung. Ultrastructural studies of experimental BRSV pneumonia reveal that BRSV replicates primarily in the superficial layer of respiratory ciliated epithelium and to a lesser extent in type II pneumocytes. BRSV infection of ciliated cells in the airway can result in the loss of cilia and ciliated cells, which may interfere with lung clearance mechanisms and predispose to bacterial pneumonia. The severity of clinical signs following experimental BRSV infection in calves is positively associated with the magnitude of decreased clearance of an inhaled protein marker, indicating that BRSV-induced ciliated epithelial damage affects the effectiveness of the mucociliary escalator. 6 Experimental BRSV infection in calves induces an acute-phase-protein response. Strong and reproducible acute-phase proteins haptoglobin and serum amyloid A will peak at 7 to 8 days after inoculation of the virus.

Such a vaccine was first made commercially available in 2007. However, administration of a MLV vaccine runs the risk of reversion to virulence and spread. The risk of reversion is reduced if gene deletion is employed. 12 In addition, maternal antibodies appear to inhibit priming of protective immune responses when intranasal BRSV vaccines are administered. 13, 14 Cattle vaccinated with MLV BRSV vaccines generally develop high concentrations of virus neutralizing antibodies (VN) and F (fusion) inhibiting antibodies, compared with low to moderate concentrations of total BRSVspecific IgG. A 2015 meta-analysis concluded that in experimentally induced exposure trials, beef or dairy calves vaccinated with modified live BRSV vaccines had no reduction in morbidity or mortality compared with unvaccinated controls. This metaanalysis included calves vaccinated by the intranasal route. 15 Cattle receiving inactivated virus vaccines develop lowered concentrations of VN antibodies and higher concentrations of virus-specific (nonneutralizing) IgG than cattle administered an MLV vaccine. The clinical significance of this difference has not been determined. Inactivated BRSV vaccines have been successful when tested by experimental challenge of vaccinated calves, which contrasts to the enhanced disease that may occur in children vaccinated with a formalin-inactivated alum adjuvanted HRSV vaccine. A 2015 meta-analysis concluded that in experimentally induced exposure trials, dairy calves less than 6 months of age vaccinated with inactivated BRSV vaccines had no change in morbidity but decreased mortality compared with unvaccinated controls. 15 None of the 81 commercial BRSV vaccines available in 2014 enable the differentiation of infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA). 16 Subunit BRSV vaccines provide an attractive alternative to MLV BRSV vaccines in that there is no potential for reversion to virulence, and vaccinated animals can be distinguished from naturally infected animals based on serologic testing. 12, 16 The use of BRSV-immunostimulating complexes (ISCOMs) has been evaluated in calves with BRSV-specific maternal antibodies. The vaccine overcame the suppressive effect of colostral antibodies and induced a strong clinical and virological protection against a BRSV challenge. Clinical protection was associated with a marked reduction in virus replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and rapid antibody and T-helper-cell responses, which may be attributable to the effects of the adjuvant in antigen presentation. 17 profuse nasal discharge, fever, inappetence, and the presence of typical nasal lesions; pneumonia is not common.

Buffalo herpesvirus-1 and elk herpesvirus are also closely related to BHV-1. BHV-5 is the cause of fatal meningoencephalitis in calves. CpHV-1 causes enteritis and generalized infection in neonatal kids. Most CpHV-1 infections in adults are subclinical, the virus can cause vulvovaginitis, balanoposthitis, or abortion. CvHV-1 can cause ocular disease in red deer and is widespread in free-living and farmed red deer. CvHV-2 has been isolated from reindeer in Finland, and serologic evidence of infection with a virus similar to BHV-1 has been reported in caribou in Canada. Although these viruses differ considerably in their virulence, they are closely related both genetically and antigenically, and they can establish latent infections similar to that of BHV-1. An immunofluorescence assay using monoclonal antibodies can discriminate between these related herpesviruses. Bovine herpesvirus-4 has been associated with mastitis in cattle.",

Animals with low levels of antibody may be immune because of cellmediated immunity. The level of cell-mediated immunity can be evaluated using the delayed-type hypersensitivity test.

In general, the intranasal vaccine provides effective protection against the respiratory form of the disease but occasionally disease occurs in vaccinated animals. The intranasal vaccines do not cause a significant systemic reaction and have been used in the face of an outbreak where all in-contact animals are vaccinated in an attempt to reduce the number of new cases. A major requirement of the be detected 9 hours after vaccination, with peak shedding occurring at 4 days. However, the intranasal vaccination of feeder calves at 7 months of age does not result in transmission of the vaccine virus to nonvaccinated animals comingled with vaccinated calves. Calves vaccinated with a live temperature-sensitive mutant of BHV-1 vaccine were protected against clinical illness from experimental challenge, but excreted the virus 2 months later following treatment with corticosteroids. This emphasizes the general principle that the use of a MLV vaccine implies a continuing commitment to vaccination that may reduce the incidence of disease but is unlikely to eradicate the infection.",

Mutants of BHV-1 have been developed by deleting one or more of the nonessential glycoproteins. Marker vaccines offer the advantage of evaluating the effect of vaccination on the circulation of the field virus under naturally occurring conditions. Using a gEdeleted BHV-1 strain, both a killed virus and MLV marker vaccine have been developed. These vaccines induce all the relevant immune responses against BHV-1-specific immune reactions, including antibodies against gE. Both vaccines have the capacity to reduce, and even to stop, the spread of BHV-1. A serologic test that detects gE-specific antibodies in serum and milk is also available. These vaccines have been tested according to the current European requirements for the development of bovine vaccines. The live vaccine is safe in pregnant cattle and is considered safe for all kind of breeding cattle, including bulls. The live-virus marker vaccine is also efficacious in the presence of maternal antibody, and vaccination of very young calves, irrespective of their BHV-1 status, can be recommended. An inactivated BHV-1 gE-negative vaccine resulted in only a slight decrease of about 1.4 liters per cow in milk production after a double vaccination. One concern with this use of modified live BHV-1 gE-negative vaccines is the potential for recombination of vaccine-virus and fieldvirus strains resulting in the emergence of virulent BHV-1 virus that is gE-negative on serologic testing. This potential can be mitigated by development of double mutant vaccine strains, such as a gE and thymidine kinase mutant Bo-HV-1 strain. 10 Combination or Multivalent Vaccines. The vaccines available for the control of diseases associated with BHV-1 infection are mostly multivalent antigen vaccines containing other respiratory pathogens such as PI-3, BRSV, and BVDV. Some also contain the antigens for the control of leptospirosis and campylobacteriosis. Vaccines containing only BHV-1 are not in common use. A Canadian field trial to compare the serologic responses in calves to eight commercial vaccines against BHV-1, PI-3, BRSV, and BVDV found some differences. Antibody responses to BHV-1 were higher in calves vaccinated with MLV vaccines than in those vaccinated with the inactivated vaccines. There were no differences in seroconversion rates and titers to BHV-1 between intranasal and MLV IM vaccines following a single vaccination. However, after double vaccination with MLV BHV-1 vaccines, both seroconversion rates and changes in titers to the virus were higher in calves vaccinated IM than in those vaccinated intranasally. Whether or not these differences in antibody titers reflect differences in vaccine efficacy against naturally occurring disease in the field situation is unknown.",

Control is focused on segregation and elimination of seropositive animals and reduction of animal movement to prevent spread.

Thereafter, passage of larvae up the bronchioles causes them to become blocked by mucus, eosinophils, and other inflammatory cells, leading to collapse of the alveolae that they supply. Coughing and dyspnea occur if a sufficiently large volume of lung tissue is affected. This is accompanied by pulmonary edema and interstitial emphysema. As no structural damage has yet occurred, treatment at this stage in the disease produces an immediate clinical response. Later, however, when mature parasites are in the major bronchi, eggs and fragments of worms killed by immunity are aspirated and provoke a foreign-body pneumonia. Secondary bacterial infections establish and sequelae such as bronchiectasis occur. Such lesions are slow to resolve, and treated animals will require a long recovery period. Later still, once all or most of the worms have been expelled, the alveolar lining cells of some 25% of recovering animals become cuboidal and nonfunctional. The reason for this is unknown but may be a response to substances released by the dead worms. Because this reaction is irreversible, many animals affected in this way will die. The response of the lung varies widely depending on the number of larvae ingested, the nutritional status and age of the host, and whether or not it is exposed to lungworm infection for the first time. Vaccinated animals or those that have recovered from clinical or subclinical infection may cough and even become tachypneic if grazed on contaminated pasture. This is known as the \"reinfection syndrome\" and occurs as many larvae reach the lungs before succumbing to the immune response. Exposure of older previously infected animals to massive challenge may invoke a severe or fatal hypersensitivity reaction.",

Progress of the disease is \u2022 Wheeled vehicles \u2022 Human and animal feet A fungus, Pilobolus, plays a particularly important role in this process and can transfer larvae across field boundaries. Fungal spores on grass pass through the grazing animal and germinate in the feces. Dictyocaulus larvae climb onto the sporangium (fruiting body), which fills with water and bursts, propelling the fungal spore and the lungworm larvae for distances of up to 3 m. 5 Dairy calves are most vulnerable to lungworm disease because they are often reared indoors until 4 to 5 months of age and then placed on paddocks grazed each year by successive calf crops. If the paddocks are heavily contaminated, acute disease may occur in 1 week or so. Usually, however, only sufficient larvae survive the winter to induce lowgrade asymptomatic infections in the susceptible calves, which then start to recontaminate the pasture and recycle the infection. With the high stocking densities commonly used, pasture challenge can reach pathogenic levels within 2 to 4 months. This model does not satisfactorily explain all outbreaks, and it has been suggested that larvae may be washed into the soil to emerge later (e.g., onto hay aftermath). Beef calves at grass with their dams are less likely to be affected as this system provides fewer opportunities for large numbers of larvae to accumulate, but outbreaks can occur particularly after weaning in the autumn. 6 In older animals, larvae ingested in the autumn become hypobiotic and resume their development in the following spring. This event occasionally causes disease in housed cattle 6 but such infections are usually asymptomatic and provide a source of pasture contamination when these carrier animals are put out to graze. This is thought to be the main source of infection in more severe climates where overwintering larvae may not survive on the pasture, but carrier animals have also been incriminated in disease outbreaks in, for example, Louisiana in the United States.",

Under optimum conditions, larvae may persist for over 1 year. They can overwinter in climates as cold as Canada and Germany. When warmer spring weather arrives, the larvae resume their motility but quickly die once their food stores are depleted. Transmission occurs when cattle ingest third-stage larvae while grazing. These migrate through the intestinal wall to reach the mesenteric lymph nodes. From here they pass via the lymphatics to the venous bloodstream and through the heart to the lungs, where they break into the alveoli. They migrate up the bronchioles to their predilection site in the larger air passages and start to lay eggs some 3 to 4 weeks after infestation. Most adult worms succumb to immune expulsion within a few weeks. These events determine the progression of the clinical syndrome and their approximate timing is as follows: 1. Penetration phase (ingestion to arrival of larvae in lung), days 1 to 7 2. Prepatent phase (larvae in lung), days 7 to 25 3. Patent phase (mature worms in lung) days 25 to 55 4.

This is because immunity develops more quickly than is the case with many other nematode infections, but nevertheless can remain incomplete for many weeks and may wane in the absence of reinfection. In most grazing seasons, immunity will develop fast enough to protect calves against the accumulating numbers of infective larvae on the grass. The farmer may not even realize that the land is contaminated. Clinical outbreaks occur when weather patterns, management, or other factors result in sudden exposure to a pasture challenge sufficient to overwhelm any immunity that has already developed. In comparison with the gastrointestinal nematodes of cattle, relatively few worms (i.e., a few hundred or thousand) are required to produce clinical signs. Thus the disease is almost entirely confined to grazing cattle and occurs most frequently in young animals in their first year on grass, although outbreaks are becoming more common in adults. 4 The epidemiology of lungworm disease is largely concerned with factors determining the number of infective larvae on the pasture and the rate at which they accumulate.

First, cattle grazing potentially contaminated pasture can be protected by vaccination or anthelmintic cover. Alternatively, steps can be taken to ensure that pastures are safe for grazing. This is usually achieved by prophylactic anthelmintic programs, but delaying spring turnout until overwintered larvae have died away is a theoretical option on organic farms. Anthelmintics may be used prophylactically to prevent disease from occurring, as a curative treatment once disease strikes, or to prevent reinfection following an outbreak. Avermectins and milbemycins are particularly useful for prophylaxis and prevention of reinfection because they are not only highly effective against the lungworms present in the animals at the time of treatment but have prolonged activity against subsequent incoming larvae. The duration of this persistent effect varies with compound and formulation.",

Avermectins and milbemycins (macrocyclic lactones) are particularly potent against immature and mature stages; doses of ivermectin, for example, as low as 0.05 mg/kg, are effective. At commercial dose rates, ivermectin by injection or as a pour-on formulation provides residual protection for up to 28 days; corresponding figures are up to 35 days for doramectin by injection and 42 days both for doramectin as a pour-on formulation and moxidectin by either route of administration. These compounds are given at 0.2 mg/kg by injection and 0.5 mg/kg as a pour-on formulation. Eprinomectin is the compound of choice for adult dairy cattle because it has a nil milk withdrawal period 14 and provides residual protection of up to 28 days when given topically (0.5 mg/kg). Albendazole (10 mg/kg), Sensible grazing management is important in all systems but cannot be relied upon, per se, for controlling parasitic bronchitis in view of the unpredictable nature of the disease. Although natural immunity provides adequate protection on many farms, it cannot be accurately measured nor predetermined. With the possible exception of beef suckler systems, calves should not be run with or follow older cattle because these may harbor asymptomatic patent infections and contaminate the pasture. An important consideration is that clean pasture can be contaminated by larvae from neighboring fields carried on windborne fungal spores (see epidemiology paragraph earlier). Although the numbers of larvae spread in this way are likely to be small, they can initiate the epidemiologic cycle culminating in disease after some weeks.",

Exposure to lightly contaminated pasture will boost immunity, but low-grade patent infections may develop in some animals. Vaccinated and nonvaccinated calves should not be grazed together because the former may contaminate the pasture, enabling lungworm to cycle through the susceptible animals. The vaccine gives a high level of protection under most conditions, but vaccinated calves should not be put onto heavily contaminated pasture. Coughing may occur when immune responses kill lungworm larvae in the lungs. Overt disease can occur in cases of overwhelming challenge. To avoid such problems on severely affected farms, vaccinated calves should be allowed only gradual access to pasture. An experimental recombinant subunit vaccine, based on the parasite's paramyosin as a recombinant antigen, that overcomes the disadvantages of the attenuated vaccine has been developed. 18 In some endemic areas, for example, in the south of Ireland, which has mild winters and an early start to the grazing season, the ideal vaccination program described earlier may be inconvenient and it is possible, by cautiously avoiding periods when massive pasture contamination is likely to occur, to vaccinate at pasture.

Specific forages have not been implicated, but affected cattle have often been consuming alfalfa, kale, rape, turnip tops, rapidly growing pasture grass, and several other feeds. The levels of tryptophan in lush pasture are sufficient to yield toxic doses of 3-methylindole, the product of tryptophan fermentation in the rumen. A 450-kg cow eating grass at an equivalent DM intake of 3.5% of BW/day with a tryptophan concentration of 0.3% of DM would ingest 0.11 g tryptophan/kg BW/day. The total amount ingested over a 3-day period would approximate the single oral dose of 0.35 g/kg BW needed to reproduce the disease experimentally. However, pasture levels of tryptophan are not necessarily higher in those associated with the disease compared with normal pastures. d,l-tryptophan is converted in the rumen to 3-methylindole (3mI), which, when given orally or intravenously, also produces the lesions characteristic for AIP in cattle and goats. In some naturally occurring cases of AIP in beef cows changed from a dry summer range to a lush green pasture, there is a marked increase in the ruminal levels of 3mI, whereas in other cases the levels are not abnormal. Failure to detect abnormally high levels in the rumen and plasma of naturally occurring cases may be related to the rapid metabolism and elimination of 3mI.",

When outbreaks of the disease occur on pasture, the first reaction is to remove the entire herd from the pasture to avoid the development of new cases. However, almost all new cases will usually occur by day 4 after the onset of the outbreak, and removal from the pasture usually will not prevent new cases. Conversely, leaving the herd on pasture usually will not result in additional cases. Severely affected cattle should be removed from the pasture with extreme care, very slowly, and only if necessary, and they should be moved to shelter from the sun. Immediate slaughter for salvage may be indicated in severe cases. Mild or moderately affected cases will commonly recover spontaneously without any treatment if left alone and not stressed, a fact that has not been given due consideration when claims are made for the use of certain drugs. Several different drugs have been advocated and used routinely for the treatment of AIP in cattle. However, none has been properly evaluated, and definitive recommendations cannot be made.",

More recently, samples collected in Wyoming in 2011 found a flock prevalence for OPPV of 47.5% and overall seroprevalence of 18%, with open range (unfenced) flocks at significantly higher risk compared those that were fenced in (an odds ratio of 3.5). 6 In Canada, a random survey found a flock prevalence of 63%, with 19% of sheep over 1 year of age being seropositive, and more recently a flock prevalence of 25% in Manitoba. Serologic surveys that use the AGID test will markedly underestimate prevalence, demonstrated by a study in Alberta where 27% of culled ewes were positive on histopathology, but using the AGID there was a seroprevalence of only 13%. 7 In the United Kingdom, MVV was introduced more recently, and so this country has lower flock and within-flock prevalence rates (estimated at 3% and up to 15%, respectively, in 2010). However, there is concern that the prevalence of maedi-visna may be increasing, demonstrated by a steady increase in the number of introduced infections in approximately 2600 flocks that participate in a maedi-visna accreditation scheme. These breakdowns are usually caused by flocks not adhering to the biosecurity rules of the scheme, such as introducing sheep into a nonaccredited flock on the same holding. 8 There is considerable variation in the prevalence of seropositive sheep between flocks. Rates of seropositivity increase with age, and so within-flock seroprevalence is influenced by the average age of the flock. Flock seroprevalence also has been positively associated with the use of foster ewes, allowing lambs older than 1 day to have contact with other lambing ewes, flock size, close contact during confinement for lambing, stocking density on pasture, and the length of time that the flock has been in existence. Within flock seroprevalence is much higher in flocks that are also infected with pulmonary adenomatosis compared with those that are not.",

There is a high degree of relatedness with the lentivirus associated with caprine arthritis encephalitis (CAE), and these ovine and caprine lentiviruses share nucleotide homology and serologic properties. Consequently, MVV, OPPV, and CAE viruses are now regarded as a viral continuum and referred to as small ruminant lentiviruses (SRLV). 1 Isolates of MVV from naturally infected sheep are genetically heterogeneous, antigenic drift is common, and antigenic variation of the surface protein facilitates the persistence of the virus in the host, both as latent and chronic infections. There is evidence for variation in pathogenic potential between isolates and hosts, and it is estimated that only about 30% of infected animals develop disease. 2 There is some evidence that the North American strains of ovine lentivirus may have originated from cross-species transmission of caprine arthritis-encephalitis virus rather than from maedi lentivirus.

These differences are not consistent and so they may reflect differences in the susceptibility of family lines within a breed. Variations in the gene encoding an ovine transmembrane protein (TMEM 154) are associated with increased or decreased susceptibility of sheep to SRLV; sheep with glutamate at position 35 have increased susceptibility, whereas those with lysine or a deletion have decreased susceptibility. 3 The average frequency of highly susceptible alleles across 74 sheep breeds was 0.51, with more than 25% of mainstream breeds being greater than 0.8. 4 In contrast, frequency of highly susceptible alleles across 3 hill breeds was 0.26 to 0.42, suggesting that they would be less affected by MVV infection. 5",

Many jurisdictions have developed accreditation programs for flocks to establish that they have a low risk of infection with MVV. Once flocks are seronegative they are subjected to testing at various intervals, typically 1 to 3 years depending on an assessment of the biosecurity risk and the presence of untested sheep on the same farm holding. rot.

Notice that a change in pressure is inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius (r 4 ), with the consequence that relatively small changes in radius have large effects on the pressure needed to generate a given flow of air.

Such sounds can vary from gurgling through to roaring and can be of diagnostic importance. 4 Advent of first rigid and then flexible endoscopes allowed greater refinement of diagnosis of disorders of the upper respiratory tract of horses when examined at rest. A further advance was the ability to examine the upper airway during intense exercise. This was first achieved in horses running on a treadmill and has now progressed to examination of horses running over ground. Although there are advantages to each mode of examination (at rest, treadmill, over ground), greatest diagnostic utility is achieved by examination of horses exercising over ground and performing their customary activity wearing their usual tack and with their rider. [5] [6] [7] [8] Laryngeal hemiplegia caused by recurrent laryngeal neuropathy is a wellrecognized abnormality of the upper airway associated with impaired performance by racehorses. In many of its forms, it is readily identified in horses at rest. However, more subtle abnormalities or those that develop as the horse fatigues are best detected, or can only be detected, on examination during strenuous exercise. It is now clear that most abnormalities of the upper airway of horses, with the exception of laryngeal hemiplegia, can only reliably be detected by examination of exercising horses. 9 Abnormalities developing during strenuous exercise by horses are best referred to as \"dynamic\" abnormalities. This term should not be used to denote the mode of examination (ie, \"dynamic endoscopy\"), which should be specified as \"over ground\" or \"treadmill. \" Terms describing abnormalities detected during endoscopic examination of the upper airway of horses have recently been standardized (Table 12 -10). 10 The use of endoscopy during exercise has revealed that dynamic abnormalities of the upper airway are often complex and involve multiple structures. 9, 11 Up to 50% of horses examined during high-speed exercise have multiple abnormalities of the upper airway. Furthermore, examination of exercising horses has revealed abnormalities not apparent during examination of resting horses, including the full spectrum of manifestations of recurrent laryngeal neuropathy, palatal instability including intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate, vocal fold collapse, aryepiglottic fold collapse, axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds, dynamic nasopharyngeal collapse, collapse of the corniculate process of the arytenoid cartilage, bilateral arytenoid and vocal fold collapse, and epiglottic retroversion. 9 ",

Dysfunction during exercise ranges from palatal instability to intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate. 4 Palatal instability and dorsal displacement of the soft palate cause an expiratory obstruction to airflow through the larynx and pharynx. 4 Palatal instability is evident as dorsoventral billowing of the soft palate during high speed exercise and flattening of the epiglottis against the palate. Palatal instability is significantly associated with dorsal displacement of the soft palate during exercise. 1 Dorsal displacement of the soft palate is an extreme of palatal instability and results when the caudal border of the soft palate displaces dorsal to the epiglottis (Fig. 12-18 ). Palatal instability is also associated with axial deviation of the aryepiglottic folds and abnormalities in the conformation of the epiglottis. 1, 5 Estimates of the prevalence of the disease in the wider population are unreliable because of the transient nature of the instability and displacement and the fact that it only occurs during exercise. Additionally, examination of large numbers of horses to determine prevalence in populations of horses has not been performed, with most reports being prevalence rates in horses selected for high-speed endoscopic examination. It is estimated to occur in 0.5% to 1.3% of Thoroughbred racehorses, and of 52 Thoroughbred racehorses examined using over ground endoscopy, 25% had dorsal displacement of the soft palate, 40% had axial deviation of the aryepiglottic fold, 35% had vocal fold collapse, and 33% had abnormal arytenoid function. 6 Forty-eight percent of the horses had multiple abnormalities. Nineteen of 57 Thoroughbred yearlings had intermittent dorsal displacement during a single examination using over ground endoscopy. 7 Dorsal displacement was detected in 10 of 46 Standardbred racehorses examined using overground endoscopy during racing-these horses were presumably considered healthy before examination. 8 Three 3.

Retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy can cause neurogenic paresis of the pharyngeal and palatal muscles, with dorsal displacement of the soft palate the most obvious sign of pharyngeal collapse during exercise. The immediate cause of the displacement is the high turbulent flow and negative intrapharyngeal pressure generated during exercise. 10 Displacement of the soft palate during strenuous exercise places the soft palate dorsal to the epiglottis, a position in which it impedes flow of air during expiration.

Swelling of the mucosa, especially around the opening to the pharynx, impairs drainage and facilitates fluid accumulation in the pouch.

The spores then germinate and proliferate in the mucosa of the dorsal, medial aspect of the medial compartment of the guttural pouch. The location of the lesion is consistent, but the reason for the disease occurring in this particular position is unclear. Factors that predispose to the development of mycotic lesions have not been determined, although it appears unlikely that fungal infection is the initial insult to the mucosa. Invasion of guttural pouch mucosa is followed by invasion of the nerves, arteries, and soft tissues adjacent to it. Invasion of the nerves causes glossopharyngeal, hypoglossal, facial, sympathetic, or vagal dysfunction. Invasion of the internal carotid artery, and occasionally the maxillary or external carotid, causes weakening of the arterial wall and aneurysmal dilatation of the artery, with subsequent rupture and hemorrhage. Death is caused by hemorrhagic shock or, in horses with dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia or starvation.",

Given that small-airway disease is common in horses, there is the potential for an important effect of factors such as viral infections, air pollution, and allergic airway disease to contribute to the initiation or propagation of EIPH. The characteristic location of lesions of EIPH in the caudodorsal lung fields has led to the proposal that hemorrhage is a result of tissue damage occurring when waves of stress, generated by forelimb foot strike, are focused and amplified into the narrowing cross-sectional area of the caudal lung lobes. According to the theory, the locomotor impact of the forelimbs results in transmission of forces through the scapula to the body wall, from where they pass into the lungs and caudally and dorsally. As the wave of pressure passes into the narrower caudodorsal regions of the lungs it generates progressively greater shearing forces that disrupt tissue and cause EIPH. However, studies of intrapleural pressures have not demonstrated the presence of a systemic pressure wave passing through the lung and do not provide support for this hypothesis.",

Detection of red cells or hemosiderophages in tracheal aspirates or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is believed to be both sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of EIPH. Examination of airway fluids indicates the presence of EIPH in a greater proportion of horses than does tracheobronchoscopic examination after strenuous exercise or racing. The greater sensitivity of examination of airway fluid is probably attributable to the ability of this examination to detect the presence of small amounts of blood or its residual products and the longevity of these products in the airways. Although endoscopic examination may detect blood in occasional horses up to 7 days after an episode of EIPH, cellular evidence of pulmonary hemorrhage persists for weeks after a single episode. Red blood cells and macrophages containing red cells are present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or tracheal aspirates for at least 1 week after strenuous exercise or instillation of autologous blood into airways, and hemosiderophages are present for at least 21 days and possibly longer. Recent studies have reported on the use of red cell numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid as a quantitative indicator of EIPH. However, this indicator of EIPH severity has not been validated nor demonstrated to be more reliable or repeatable than tracheobronchoscopic examination and visual scoring. Furthermore, considerable concern exists over the suitability of red cell counts in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for assessment of severity of EIPH given that an unknown area, although presumably small, of the lung is examined by lavage and that there is a risk that this area of lung may not be representative of the lung as a whole, similar to the situation of examination of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of horses with pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage of sections of both lungs, achieved using an endoscope, may obviate some of these concerns.",

Grossly, horses examined within hours of strenuous exercise, such as horses examined because of catastrophic musculoskeletal injuries incurred during racing, may have severe petechiation in the caudodorsal lung fields. Horses with chronic disease have blue/gray or blue/brown discoloration of the visceral pleural surfaces of the caudodorsal lung fields that is often sharply demarcated, especially on the diaphragmatic surface. The discoloration affects both lungs equally, with 30% to 50% of the lung fields being discolored in severe cases.

Areas of affected lung may be separated by normal lung. There is proliferation of bronchial vessels, predominantly arteries and arterioles, in affected areas.

There is a recommendation for use of furosemide, but because of the regulatory issues related to its use, this is only a weak recommendation. 1 Therapy of EIPH is usually a combination of attempts to reduce the severity of subsequent hemorrhage and efforts to minimize the effect of recent hemorrhage. Treatment of EIPH is problematic for a number of reasons. First, the pathogenesis of EIPH has not been determined although the available evidence supports a role for stress failure of pulmonary capillaries secondary to exerciseinduced pulmonary hypertension. Second, there is a lack of information using large numbers of horses under field conditions that demonstrates an effect of any medication or management practice (with the exception of bedding) on EIPH. There are numerous studies of small numbers of horses (< 40) under experimental conditions but these studies often lacked the statistical power to detect treatment effects and, furthermore, the relevance of studies conducted on a treadmill to horses racing competitively is questionable. 1 Treatments for EIPH are usually intended to address a specific aspect of the pathogenesis of the disease and will be discussed in that context but should be considered in the context of the amount and strength of evidence, which for most treatments is scant and weak.",

Evidence for a multigene cause for predisposition to RAO includes the finding of quantitative trait loci (QTL) located on two different chromosomes (ECA 13 and ECA 15) in different families of affected Warmbloods 4,5 and failure to identify a monogenetic predisposition to RAO. Further studies in half-sibling horses and from unrelated horses indicates that at least one causative variant is a QTL region located on ECA 13 that is not associated with any coding variants, suggesting that the cause is a regulatory mutation. 6 The cause does not appear to be abnormalities in the gene encoding DNAH3 (dynein-a component of cilia), although it is located in this QTL and has 53 polymorphisms including 7 nonsynonymous variants. 7 Similarly, mutations in the integrin alpha X gene, which is related to allergy in humans and is located in the region of the QTL in ECA 13, are not associated with RAO. 4, 8 However, expression of interleukin 4 receptor gene, which is also located in the region of the QTL, is greater in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of RAOaffected half-siblings than in unaffected animals, suggesting a role for this cytokine, or a mutation in its gene, in RAO. 9 Environmental Factors RAO is caused by inhalation by susceptible horses of dust particles found in barns, bedding, and feed materials such as dusty hay. The inhaled particles include endotoxin, mites, plant debris, inorganic materials, and conidia and fragments of molds. Faenia rectivirgula (formerly known as Micropolyspora faeni), Aspergillus fumigatus, and Thermoactinomyces vulgaris are molds commonly associated with respiratory disease in susceptible horses, as evidenced by experimental studies involving inhalation of mold or mold fragments by horses. Molds contain a number of inflammatory substances, including various allergens, glucans, mycotoxins, and proteases, and it is not clear which of these agents are the inciting cause of RAO. Furthermore, dust containing mold also contains endotoxin. Inhalation of fungal spores, endotoxin and silica microspheres causes RAO in susceptible horses but not in healthy horses. 10 There was neutrophilic inflammation in both healthy and RAO horses but bronchospasm in only RAO horses. 10 Endotoxin contamination of molds contributes to the airway response to inhalation of preparations of molds used in experimental studies and inhalation of endotoxin alone produces airway inflammation and impaired respiratory function in horses in a dose-dependent manner, with RAO-susceptible horses having an exaggerated response at lower doses. Endotoxin concentrations in the breathing zone of horses are eight times higher in stables than at pasture. 11 However, the response to endotoxin is less than that of susceptible horses exposed to hay dust containing endotoxin, indicating that endotoxin alone is not sufficient to cause the clinical signs of RAO. Other compounds in hay dust are integral to the development of RAO. It is emphasized that there is not one causative agent acting alone but rather a range of agents that, when inhaled in sufficient concentration by susceptible horses, induce airway disease. It is likely that RAO is associated with the potentiating interactions among several agents present in barn or hay dust and is not simply a response to one agent. The mechanisms underlying development of airway inflammation and respiratory dysfunction are provided under \"Pathogenesis. \" Viral infections and 3-methylindole intoxication are not considered important causes of RAO.",

Although the reason for this association has not been demonstrated, it is reasonable to assume that at least part of the increased risk is attributable to poorer air quality for horses in an urban environment. 12 Management practices that might contribute to development or exacerbation of RAO vary widely around the world, with differing practices related to duration of stabling, type of bedding, air quality in stables and such. Within Great Britain, 4% of horses are stabled 24 hours per day year round and 9% stabled all day (24 hours) in winter. 19 61% are stabled part of each day with pasture turn-out and 36% are turned for 24 hours each day. 19 Development of disease is related to inhalation of respirable particles that gain access to the lower respiratory tract. Respirable particles are less than 5 \u00b5m diameter, the principal source of these particles in stalls is hay, and the majority of particles are fungal spores. The concentration of particles in air of the stable is determined by the rate of release of particles from hay, which is dependent in large part on the quality of the hay, concentration of fungal spores in the hay, and the rate of clearance of dust from the stable, a function of the ventilation rate. Concentrations of respirable dust particles in the breathing zone of stabled horses can be as high as 20 mg/m 3 . The severity of increases in neutrophil count and proportion and decreases in pulmonary function in experimental models of RAO are related in a dosedependent fashion to the amount of dust inhaled. The presence of dust particles, and not the soluble products in hay dust, is responsible for most of the airway neutrophilia induced by inhalation of hay dust.",

Diced paper and wood shavings, when fresh, usually contain very few spores. Barley and wheat straw are usually free of any small spores such as A. fumigatus or M. faeni. Bedding horses on fresh wood shavings and feeding a nutritionally complete pelleted ration results in a respirable dust burden 3% of that of horses fed hay and bedded with straw. Dust burdens measured in the air of the stall underestimate the respirable particle challenge of horses because of the high concentration of particles in hay and bedding, areas from which the horse inhales while eating.

            "text": "The precise immunologic abnormalities and mechanisms causing airway and peribronchial inflammation in affected horses is unclear. 21 Inflammation is associated with excessive mucus production, airway swelling, and abnormal lung function. The inflammatory response in horses with RAO is neutrophilic, with lesser numbers of mast cells and rarely eosinophils. 20 The mechanisms underlying this inflammatory response have not been fully elucidated, but differing responses in RAO and healthy horses, and differing responses among families of RAO sensitive horses, to antigenic challenge supports an acquired immune-mediated process. 22 Furthermore, upregulated expression of IL1\u03b2, IL8, TLR4, TNF\u03b1, TGF\u03b21, and NFk\u03b2 transcripts in RAO-affected compared with healthy horses and the strong correlation with clinical variables indicative of disease severity provide support for an immune-mediated disease process. 23 There is currently no clear consensus on the immune mechanisms involved in development or perpetuation of RAO despite numerous studies examining cell types, 20,24-28 cytokines, 23,29-34 gene expression, 23, 29, 31, 35 and antibody isotypes. 36 The presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is supportive of a hypersensitivity reaction (type 1 hypersensitivity response), as is the observation that reaginic antibodies (IgE and some classes of IgG) in serum of horses sensitive to Aspergillus fumigatus cause mast cell (rat origin) degranulation. 36 Others have proposed type 3 and type 4 immune reactions as the basis of the disease, and there are suggestions of polarized Th1 or Th2 responses. Detection of increased mRNA expression of thymic stromal lymphopoietin, a cytokine involved in lymphocyte development and driving a Th2 response, in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peribronchial cells of horses with RAO is evidence of a contribution of a Th2 mechanism to RAO. 32 One proposed explanation is that RAOsusceptible horses exhibit a Th2-like immune response to inhalation of hay or barn dust characterized by increased expression of interleukins 4 and 5 and decreased expression of interferon-\u03b3 in cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage. Others have not detected a pure Th2-like cytokine profile, finding instead a mixed inflammatory response including increases in expression (mRNA) in cells obtained from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of affected horses of interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukins 1\u03b2 and 4, and interleukins 8 and 17 (potent attractors of neutrophils) but not interleukins 2, 5, and 10. However, all the studies cited previously were performed on crude preparations of cells obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage, and the results could have been influenced by the varying proportions of types of cells in these preparations. A study examining just CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes in blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of RAO-affected horses demonstrated a general down-regulation in expression of interferon-\u03b3, and interleukins 4, 5, and 13 and no evidence of a cytokine profile consistent with either sole or predominate Th1-or Th2-like responses. The magnitude of the inflammatory response varies depending on the challenge (i.e., nature of the inhaled material) with responses to endotoxin characteristically being less than that of hay dust. Regardless of the underlying mechanism, it is clear that T cells are involved in mediating and likely modulating the response to exposure to inciting agents in susceptible horses 25 and this results in airway inflammation and interference with normal respiratory function. The role of the observed increased rate of T-cell apoptosis in resolution of clinical signs after removal of the inciting agents in RAO-affected horses is uncertain. 27 Following inhalation of inciting agents there is recruitment of neutrophils, but not eosinophils or platelets, into the lungs in most horses that develop changes in lung function. Histologically, there is peribronchiolar accumulation of lymphocytes and luminal accumulations of neutrophils in affected horses. The neutrophilic response is airways is mediated at least in part by IL-8 and IL-17 and by MAPK and PI3K pathways in horses with heaves. 30 The entry of neutrophils into the airways is associated with activation of neutrophils and platelets. Neutrophil activation occurs in horses with RAO 10 and 24 hours after antigen challenge and is mediated by increased expression of CD13 on circulating neutrophils of susceptible horses exposed to inciting dust. 37 However, there is not increased expression of mRNA for TNF-alpha, IL-beta, IL-8, and MIP-2 in horses with RAO, suggesting that release of these cytokines is not necessary for the neutrophilic response characteristic of the disease. 38 The neutrophils of horses during episodes of RAO, but not when the horses are asymptomatic, have increased adherence in vitro to protein coated plastic suggesting a mechanism for the increased migration of neutrophils into airways of affected horses. However, neutrophils of asymptomatic RAO-affected horses (ie, those horses in remission of the disease) have an exaggerated serum concentration of TNF and mRNA expression after lipopolysaccharide exposure compared with cells of healthy horses. 26 A greater proportion of neutrophils in BALF of RAO-affected horses are viable and have a slower rate of apoptosis compared with those of unaffected horses, suggesting a role for increased neutrophil survival in airways in horses with RAO. 28 Inhibition of neutrophil phosphodiesterase-4 activity does not alleviate clinical signs of RAO or decrease neutrophil numbers in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in affected horses, suggesting that neutrophils are not primarily involved in the genesis of airway obstruction. The extent to which neutrophils in the airways are activated has not been determined, and their role in the development of respiratory dysfunction is unclear given that glucocorticoid administration attenuates the respiratory dysfunction but not airway neutrophilia in horses with RAO (see under \"Treatment\").",

Activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 is higher in horses with RAO than in unaffected horses and is induced in a dosedependent manner by inhalation of inciting substances including hay dust and endotoxin. MMP-9 is likely important in the inflammatory process associated with RAO through excessive gelatinolytic proteolysis that can contribute to lung injury and through a role in lung remodeling. Inflammation is also associated with increased oxidative stress in lungs of horses with RAO as indicated by elevated concentrations of epi-PGF2a and redox ratio of glutathione in pulmonary lavage fluid.",

Accumulation of mucus is attributable to decreased clearance and increased production. The mucus in horses with RAO differs in both composition and viscoelasticity from that of clinically normal horses and this might contribute to its decreased clearance. The viscosity of mucus can increase threefold in RAO susceptible horses stabled and exposed to hay dust. Increased production of mucus is associated with up-regulation of the equine MUC5AC gene, which is responsible for production of mucin, but not with IL-13 or epithelial gene (CLCA1, EGFR, Bcl-2 and MUC5AC expression, 39 in the small airways of horses with RAO.",

Airway obstruction is a result of bronchospasm, inflammatory thickening of airways, and accumulation of mucus and cells in the airways. Bronchospasm is largely relieved by administration of bronchodilator drugs or removal of the inciting cause, but residual effects on lung function remain and are attributable to inflammation and fibrosis and bronchoconstriction of small airways. Bronchoconstriction in both normal and affected horses is caused by parasympathetic activity and release of acetylcholine that reacts with muscarinic receptors on airway smooth muscle. However, the response is exaggerated in horses with RAO. Stimulation of airway sensory receptors results in an exaggerated bronchoconstrictive response, possibly because of the action of inflammatory mediators and/or byproducts. The exaggerated bronchoconstrictive response is not specific for allergens, and any substance that activates airway sensory receptors may incite bronchoconstriction once the sensitivity of the receptors is enhanced by inhalation of the inciting allergens. Exaggerated airway responsiveness to inhaled irritants persists for up to 3 days after a single exposure to the inciting agent and is likely important in the development of clinical signs of the disease. Bronchoconstriction increases work of breathing, but hypoventilation probably contributes little to the hypoxemia of affected horses, given that Paco 2 is rarely increased.",

Retrospective examination of records of horses with a history of RAO suggests that they are more likely to react, and react to a larger number, of intradermally injected allergens than horses without a history of RAO. However, reactions to individual allergens cannot be used to determine hypersensitivity to particular allergens, although it is suggested that overall patterns of reactivity, with a history of exposure of the horse to these allergens, might be useful in guiding management of affected horses. Contrary to these results, a prospective study demonstrated that horses with RAO did not have a greater rate of reaction to intradermal skin tests than did horses not affected by RAO. Intradermal testing did not distinguish clinically relevant reactions from those that were not clinically relevant. Horses with RAO have greater sensitivity to intradermal injection of histamine, which is commonly used as a positive control, than horses without RAO. Overall, intradermal skin testing is neither useful in detecting horses with RAO nor in determining hypersensitivity to particular allergens in individual horses. Results of such testing might be useful in management of horses, but this has not been demonstrated. The usefulness of intradermal skin testing and subsequent administration of preparations of antigens selected on the basis of intradermal testing, in an effort to hyposensitize horses with RAO, has not been determined. The apparent lack of efficacy of intradermal testing might be because the extent of reactivity to intradermal injection of mold preparations does not correlate with the severity of pulmonary dysfunction after inhalation of the same preparation in horses with RAO.",

Cell counts and the neutrophilia in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are not reliably reduced by administration of corticosteroids. Affected horses, after institution of appropriate measures to control inhalation of hay and barn dust, should be treated with the lowest dose that controls the disease and only for as long as necessary. The dose of corticosteroid can be reduced gradually and the frequency of administration decreased from once daily to once every second or third day (or greater, depending on the preparation) to achieve this end.

The size of the respirable challenge from heated hays and straws arises from the prolificacy of the species involved and their small spore size. The highest respirable challenges are from the presence of thermotolerant and thermophilic mold species. The most critical factors in determining the microbial development in plant-based materials are water content and thermal environment. Hay baled at 15% to 20% moisture heats little; it is virtually dust-free and contains few spores. Baling hay with 20% to 30% moisture leads to temperatures of up to 35\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 C (95 to 113 F). At these temperatures, hazardous contamination may develop with the appearance of thermotolerant fungi and actinomycetes. The heaviest contamination of hay and straw occurs with baling at 35% to 50% moisture, when spontaneous heating up to 50\u00b0 to 60\u00b0 C (122 to 140 F) may occur. Microscopically, these hays show large numbers of fungal spores in the 2-to 5-\u00b5m size range.",

It appears to be a disease of adult horses that are on pasture most of the time in the summer. It occurs most commonly in the warm, humid summer months of June to September. 1 Affected horses gradually recover during the cooler months of winter and early spring, and the disease can recur in the same horse each successive summer. Most severe signs occurred during late spring and early summer during times of high airborne pollen counts. Allergy to pollens and fungal spores appears to be a factor and is associated with conditions conducive to production of fungal spores and grass pollens. 1 Affected horses have increased expression of interleukin-4 and interferon-\u03b3 in cells of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells but not increased concentrations of IgE in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Endothelin concentrations are higher in the BALF and serum of affected than unaffected horses. 2 Affected horses have clinical findings typical of heaves including nasal discharge, coughing, tachypnea, labored expiratory effort, and crackles and wheezes on auscultation. There is moderate-to-severe accumulation of mucus in the large airways evident on endoscopic examination. Lung function testing is consistent with bronchoconstriction. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid contains large numbers of nondegenerate neutrophils and lesser numbers of lymphocytes and mast cells. Necropsy reveals overinflated lungs that do not collapse when the chest is opened and that retain the impressions made by the ribs. The predominant histologic finding is accumulation of mucus in small airways. Inflammation is not severe and most inflammatory cells present are neutrophils and lymphocytes in peribronchial tissues. Treatment includes stabling and administration of corticosteroids and bronchodilators, as discussed for recurrent airway obstruction (see Table 12 -13). ",

Contraction of the diaphragm occurs because of stimulation of the phrenic nerve as it passes over the atria of the heart. Thumps is often associated with electrolyte or acid-base abnormalities in horses. The disease occurs commonly in horses used for strenuous exercise, and in particular horses used for endurance racing, in which approximately 10% of horses eliminated from competing have thumps. 1 The disease occurs in Standardbred and Thoroughbred racehorses, and individual animals can be affected repeatedly. This disease also occurs sporadically in adult horses and ponies that have not exercised, and peripartum mares (as part of lactation tetany). The syndrome is characterized by a violent hiccough occurring synchronously with every heartbeat. The lateral aspect of the thorax and cranial abdomen appear to jump or \"thump\" regularly in affected horses. It is often unilateral, with the contraction being felt very much more strongly on one side than the other. The horse is distressed because the hiccough interferes with eating, and to an extent with respiration. In some cases, there are additional signs suggestive of hypocalcemia. These include muscular rigidity and fasciculation, and a high-stepping gait. There is often hypocalcemia, hemoconcentration, alkalosis or mixed acid-base abnormalities, and hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and elevation of creatinine phosphokinase levels in affected horses. Hypocalcemia can be profound. The disease is reported as a consequence of hypocalcemia secondary to primary hypoparathyroidism in two Thoroughbred horses.",

It is a facultative intracellular parasite of macrophages, in which it survives by virtue of virulence factors that act to prevent phagosomelysosome fusion and bacterial death. 2 Virulence is associated in part with the presence of highly immunogenic virulence associated proteins (Vap, coded by plasmid gene pVAP), of which pVAPA is apparently the most important, although the precise role of the other Vap proteins has not been determined. The presence of VapA is necessary but not sufficient for pathogenicity, which requires the presence of other virulence factors, including a number of microbial enzymes. 2 Virulence plasmids can be lost by R. equi strains and reacquired by conjugation with virulent strains. 5 Genomic analysis has identified additional virulence factors that are chromosomal rather than plasmid based. 2 Vap A is a surface-expressed, lipidmodified protein that elicits an intense humoral response by foals. Expression of Vap A, C, D, and E is upregulated by incubation at 37\u00b0 C (98.6 F), consistent with their role as virulence factors. Other genes probably involved in virulence are also upregulated by conditions that mimic those in vivo. The presence of the virulence proteins is associated with enhanced ability of virulent R. equi to survive and replicate within macrophages, affect the number of virulent R. equi and the ease of infection. Because aerosol infection by virulent R. equi in dust is thought to be the most important route of infection of foals, factors that favor the accumulation and persistence of R. equi in soil and its ability to become aerosolized most probably increase the risk of infection.

Soil pH, salinity, and concentrations of various elements including iron, zinc, and copper are not associated with the risk of foals developing R. equi pneumonia on farms in Texas. These soil-associated risk factors were examined because R. equi is a normal inhabitant of the soil and of the intestine of ruminants, horses, and pigs. It is not highly resistant, but it has been found to survive in moist soil for periods of longer than 12 months. The infection is considered to be soil associated and to be maintained through a soil-horse cycle.

Foals subject to experimental challenge exposure are much more susceptible to infection, and by lower doses, during the first week of life. 10 Higher doses are required to induce disease in 3-week and 6-week-old foals. 10 Lower challenge doses are associated with milder and more slowly progressive disease and spontaneous resolution of infection. For spontaneous disease, exposure presumably occurs within the first few days of life, before waning of maternally derived passive immunity. Infection results in increases in serum concentration of VapA-specific IgG(T) in foals. 11 In adult horses, in which the disease is rare, protective immunity is associated with both cellular and humoral immune responses characterized by enhanced immunoproliferative responses of CD4 and CD8 cells and presence of IgGa and IgGb antibodies to Vap A. Opsonizing antibody to R. equi is an important defense mechanism in experimentally infected foals and administration of R. equi hyperimmune plasma or plasma rich in anti-Vap A and C antibodies protects experimentally infected foals from developing pneumonia. Overall, these results suggest that foals that develop R. equi pneumonia have a T-helper-cell (Th)2-like response to infection, rather than a Th1-like response. Th1-like responses, which are associated with enhanced CD4 and CD8 responses, are believed to be important in resistance to the disease. Whether the switch to a Th2-like response to infection is a function of virulent R. equi or an attribute of susceptible foals has not been determined.",

However, clinical disease is important because it is these foals that are at risk of death and that require prolonged treatment.

Apparent acute onset of the clinical disease is preceded by a long incubation period during which clinical signs are minimal. Severe clinical disease is evident as respiratory distress, and the foal is reluctant to move and to suckle. Cyanosis can be present in severe cases.

Monitoring of blood white cell concentration and plasma fibrinogen concentration is useful in foals from farms on which the disease is endemic. White blood cell concentrations above 13.0 \u00d7 10/L (13,000 cells/\u00b5L) have a sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 61%, respectively, for R. equi pneumonia. The high sensitivity means that few foals with the disease will be missed, whereas the moderate specificity means that a number of foals will be incorrectly suspected as having the disease. Because a high white cell count can be caused by a number of diseases other than R. equi pneumonia, foals with high white cell counts from farms on which the disease is endemic should be further examined for evidence of disease, including detailed clinical examination possibly including ultrasonographic examination, culture or PCR of tracheal aspirates, or thoracic radiography. Measurement of plasma fibrinogen concentration is less useful for detecting foals with R. equi pneumonia. Plasma fibrinogen concentrations of 400 mg/dL (0.4 g/L) have sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 51%, respectively, whereas concentrations of 600 mg/dL (0.6 g/L) have sensitivity and specificity of 38% and 96%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values of the tests depend on the prevalence of the disease among the group of foals examined, being low for farms on which the disease is rare and increasing as the prevalence of the disease increases. Serial measurement of serum amyloid A concentrations is not useful for detecting foals with clinically inapparent R. equi pneumonia, 18 nor do foals with pneumonia reliably have higher serum amyloid A concentrations than normal foals.",

Conventional treatment is administration of the combination of an acid-stable erythromycin (preferably estolate) at a dose of 25 mg/kg orally every 12 hours and rifampin at a dose of either 5 mg/kg every 12 hours or 10 mg/kg every 24 hours. Other esters or preparations of erythromycin are less well absorbed or have shorter elimination half-lives than the estolate ester and must be administered more frequently. Erythromycin ethylsuccinate does not provide optimal therapy for R. equi pneumonia in foals because of poor absorption after oral administration. The macrolide antibiotics azithromycin and clarithromycin have also been used to treat foals with R. equi pneumonia. Treatment of foals with a combination of clarithromycin (7.5 mg/kg orally every 12 hours) and rifampin results in improved survival over foals treated with azithromycin (10 mg/kg orally q24h) and rifampin or erythromycin and rifampin in a veterinary teaching hospital. Azithromycin is typically administered with rifampin at a dose rate of 10 mg/kg q24h for every 24 hours for 5 to 7 days and then once every 48 hours. Gamithromycin (6 mg/kg intramuscularly [IM] or intravenously [IV] once every 7 days, with or without administration of rifampin) is currently not recommended for routine use pending results of studies demonstrating its equivalence to or superiority over other treatments. Administration of gamithromycin (6 mg/kg IM or IV once every 7 days, with foals administered IV gamithromycin also administered rifampin) was associated with resolution of lesions detected by ultrasonographic examination in 95% of foals with R. equi pneumonia. 23 IM was associated with marked lameness in 35% of foals and colic that required administration of analgesics in 45% of foals. Tulathromycin was not as effective as the combination of azithromycinrifampin in treatment of R. equi abscesses in foals in a large prospective field study. 24 Tilmicosin is poorly active against R. equi. 25 Ultrasonographic examination of the thorax of foals may permit identification of foals with clinically inapparent pulmonary abscesses, providing the opportunity for early intervention in the disease. However, many (~90%) lesions less than 10 cm in diameter will resolve without treatment, and treatment with antimicrobials confers no clear benefit over watchful waiting (Fig.  12-30 ). 12 Another study demonstrated resolution of lesions in 44% of foals with lesions greater than 1.0 cm administered a placebo-a resolution rate not statistically different from that in foals administered tulathromycin (IM), azithromycin alone, or azithromycin and rifampin. 6 It is unclear if there is an advantage to combined therapy of rifampin and a macrolide compared with treatment with a macrolide alone. The current recommendation is to use the combination of drugs.",

Currently, over 300 variants of S. zooepidemicus are recognized by multilocus sequence typing, and disease is associated with specific variants. 2,3 S. zooepidemicus is the most common beta-hemolytic streptococcus isolated from horses at necropsy examination, representing 72% of isolates. 4 Most isolates are from placenta, fetal tissues, and genital tract of mares, but this likely represents the population of animals examined and would not include clinically normal horses in which S. zooepidemicus is commensal in the upper respiratory tract.",

S. zooepidemicus was isolated from 88% of foals with clinical evidence of lower respiratory tract disease, and isolation of the organism was associated with an increased proportion of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, suggesting a causal role for this organism. Similarly, the number of S. zooepidemicus isolated from tracheal aspirates of adult horses is directly proportional to the number of neutrophils in the aspirate and the probability that they have a cough. The association of S. zooepidemicus and inflammatory airway disease in racehorses is independent of previous viral infection, suggesting a role for S. zooepidemicus as a primary pathogen. Presence and number of colony forming units (cfu) of S. zooepidemicus in tracheal aspirates of horses is significantly associated with the risk of the horse having inflammatory airway disease. Adult horses dying of pneumonia associated with transportation often yield S. zooepidemicus on culture of lung lesions, and the disease can be reproduced experimentally. S. zooepidemicus with Chlamydophila caviae causes conjunctivitis and rhinitis in adult horses. 13 These results clearly demonstrate a role for S. zooepidemicus in the pathogenesis of respiratory disease of horses. However, it is unclear whether S. zooepidemicus is a primary cause of disease, a secondary contaminant, or an invader of airways compromised by viral infection or other agents.",

S. zooepidemicus isolates from horses in southern England demonstrate increasing resistance to tetracycline but not the combination of trimethoprim and sulfonamide (TMS). 14 Most S. zooepidemicus isolates (70%) are resistant to gentamicin, whereas 95% are sensitive to penicillin and 55% sensitive to TMS. Forty-five percent of isolates are resistant to enrofloxacin-a recent phenomenon. 14 Different sensitivity patterns are reported for S. zooepidemicus ETIOLOGY Streptococcus equi subsp. equi (S. equi) is a gram-positive coccobacillus that produces a beta-hemolysin, evident as a zone of clear hemolysis surrounding colonies growing on blood agar. There is evidence that S. equi is a biovar or genovar of S. zooepidemicus. S. equi is highly host-adapted to Equidae. Genetic analysis, particularly of the variable region of the SeM gene, demonstrates the existence of clones that vary geographically. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] For instance, 21 SeM alleles were detected among 145 S. equi strains isolated in the United Kingdom, 1 and two SeM alleles detected in horses in New Zealand had distinct geographic distributions. 5 Similar analysis reveals the presence of two major S. equi clades in Ireland, with both being also common in the United Kingdom. 4 Individual outbreaks can be caused by S. equi of the same SeM type and be restricted geographically or by use of horse. 6 Analysis of SeM mutations in real time allows differentiation or linkage of strangles outbreaks and enables risk assessment of equine events where there is incursion of the disease. It is unclear whether changes in the SeM protein associated with these strains are associated with differing pathogenicity. 1 There is variation in virulence related to the amount of M protein and hyaluronic capsule produced. An atypical milder form of the disease is associated with a capsule-deficient variant of S. equi, and an intranasal vaccine is based on a live, attenuated, nonencapsulated SeM-2 strain, although this strain can cause disease. 7",

However, outbreaks of milder form of the disease are more challenging to diagnose, and confirmation is based on identification of the organism or demonstration of seroconversion. In acute disease, nasopharyngeal swabs or pus aspirates from abscesses can confirm S. equi infection. Because false negative culture results occur in 30% to 40% of cases, and qPCR has a sensitivity 94% and specificity 96%, and combining qPCR with culture will detect more than 90% of infected horses. 9 Carriers are defined as horses shedding bacteria more than 6 weeks after clinical recovery. These horses will have serologic evidence of infection and can be detected by a series of at least 3 nasopharyngeal swabs at weekly intervals, or a single guttural pouch lavage ideally combined with a single nasopharyngeal swab, submitted for qPCR combined with culture. This will detect greater than 90% of carriers. 18 Infection by Actinomyces denticolens caused submandibular abscessation in horses that can appear clinically similar to strangles. Diagnosis is based on bacterial culture. 19, 20 TREATMENT The specific treatment of choice for S. equi infection of horses is penicillin, either as procaine penicillin G (22,000 IU/kg intramuscularly every 12 hours) or potassium or sodium penicillin G (22,000 IU/kg intravenously every 6 hours). Tetracycline (6.6 mg/kg intravenously every 12-24 hours) and sulfonamide-trimethoprim combinations (15-30 mg/kg orally or intravenously every 12 hours) can be efficacious but should only be used if penicillin cannot be administered. Aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin or amikacin, and the fluoroquinolones are not effective. Proportions of a small number (10) S. equi isolates from horses in southern England during 2007 to 2012 resistant to various antimicrobials were as follows: enrofloxacin 40%, gentamicin 80%, penicillin or ceftiofur 0%, trimethoprim-sulfonamide combination 20%, doxycycline 10%, oxytetracycline 0%, and resistant to three or more antimicrobials 20%. 21 Similar sensitivities are reported for 22 isolates from Western Canada, with all isolates sensitive to ampicillin, ceftiofur, cephalothin, penicillin, erythromycin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and no isolates sensitive to amikacin or neomycin. Approximately 80% of isolates were sensitive to TMS or tetracycline. 22 Use of ceftiofur, a third-generation cephalosporin, in horses is discouraged on public health grounds. 21 There is considerable debate about the treatment of horses with strangles. Folklore and anecdotal reports suggest that antibiotic treatment of horses with strangles is contraindicated because it promotes the development of metastatic infection. There is no experimental or empirical evidence to support this contention, and horses with strangles should be treated with therapeutic doses of an appropriate antibiotic, such as procaine penicillin, for a period of time sufficient to effect a cure, as appropriate.",

Treatment at this stage causes rapid resolution of fever, anorexia, nasal discharge, and lymphadenopathy in individual horses and may abort an incipient outbreak of the disease in a stable or yard.

In many facilities with large numbers or frequent turnover of horses, such as large training yards or stud farms, a control approach may be more achievable than eradication. 24 The approach to managing horses entering a facility in which S. equi infection is not present involves serologic testing of all horses before entry using an ELISA of known high sensitivity and specificity. Horses that are seropositive on arrival have prima facie evidence of exposure and are considered to be potential carriers of S. equi until demonstrated by PCR and culture to be negative for the organism. These horses are then screened for S equi carriage by guttural pouch lavage combined with a nasopharyngeal swab tested by qPCR and culture. 9, 15 Horses with negative or equivocal serology on arrival should not be admitted to the facility and should be retested 10 to 14 days later to establish serologic status and then either admitted to the facility if they are seronegative or screened for S equi carriage if they are seropositive. 24 Any horses testing positive for carriage need to be treated (see previous discussion) and cured of infection before entry into the yard.",

This immunity lasts for up to 5 years in approximately three-quarters of recovered horses. Maximum resistance to disease probably requires both systemic and mucosal immunity to a variety of S. equi factors including, but not limited to, M protein. As noted previously, vaccination will result in positive results of serologic testing for exposure to S. equi. It is not possible at this time to differentiate between responses to vaccination and responses to natural infection. This ambiguity confounds use of serologic tests in control of the disease. The benefits of potential increases in resistance to the disease induced by vaccination should be weighed against the restrictions this imposes on use of serologic testing in control programs. The efficacy of vaccination of adult horses with S. equi bacterins or M protein extracts of S. equi administered intramuscularly is controversial. Administration of M protein vaccines elicits an increase in the concentration of serum opsonizing antibodies but does not confer a high degree of resistance to natural exposure. However, in a controlled field trial, vaccination with an M protein commercial vaccine three times at 2-week intervals reduced the clinical attack rate by 50% in a population of young horses in which the disease was endemic. Horses vaccinated only once were not protected against strangles. A modified live vaccine induced a strong antibody response but caused substantial morbidity and some deaths among young ponies, highlighting the challenges with use of attenuated vaccines. 25 Administration of a live, attenuated submucosal vaccine to mares appears to be safe. 26 This result suggests that, in the face of an outbreak, vaccination might reduce the number of horses that develop strangles but will not prevent strangles in all vaccinated horses. A common vaccination protocol involves the administration of an M protein vaccine intramuscularly for an initial course of three injections at 2-week intervals, with further administration of the vaccine every 6 months in animals at increased risk of contracting the disease. On breeding farms, vaccination of mares during the last 4 to 6 weeks of gestation and of the foals at 2 to 3 months of age might reduce the incidence of the disease.",

At present there is no evidence of reversion of the vaccinal strain to virulence, and horses developing strangles subsequent to vaccination have all been infected with virulent strains of S. equi, apparently before 6 where the disease is present, 3 and in another horse, some years later, that was born in Germany. 7 These cases highlight the need for vigilance in detection of glanders. 6 Occurrence of outbreaks of the disease since 1986 is cataloged and available. 8 The disease has reemerged, or at least been detected, recently in India and Pakistan. 2, 9, 10 An outbreak in Bahrain was attributed to multiple introductions of infection, rather than simply one source. 1 The disease was more widespread but has been eradicated from most countries. Glanders was an important disease when there were large concentrations of horses in cities and armies, but now has sporadic occurrence, or occurs in localized outbreaks, even in infected areas.",

From the point of international movement of horses, tests should first have a high sensitivity to ensure that there are few false-negative results-with the potential for consequent transportation of infected animals-whereas detection of diseased animals in populations of horses in which the disease is rare demands tests with high specificity. The solution is often to first screen with tests of high sensitivity, such as the complement fixation test, followed by a test with much higher specificity (but often lower sensitivity), such as immunoblotting. 16 The outcome of such serial testing is a high sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic performance of various tests has improved with use of refined reagents (including use of recombinant or purified bacterial proteins or lipopolysaccharide, 16 or antibodies) and optimized tests conditions, 18 such as the temperature at which complement fixation tests are incubated. 15 All serologic tests can be inaccurate for periods up to 6 weeks following performance of the mallein test.",

EAdV-1 can be isolated or detected by PCR from healthy adult horses, although at a very low rate, 5, 6 and from 1% to 3% horses with signs of upper respiratory disease. 7, 8 Genomic analysis of EAdV-2 indicates markedly different lineage to that of EAdV-1. 9 The virus is readily isolated from, or detected by PCR, in nasal swabs of approximately 50% of sick or healthy foals. 6 Postparturient mares can shed the virus. 6 Infection with EAdV-1 and EAdV-2 is worldwide. Serologic surveys differ in the proportion of seropositive horses, likely at least partially a result of the testing methodology, with serum neutralization tests yielding higher seropositive rates than ELISA tests. 5 Approximately 80% of horses in New South Wales, Australia are positive by serum neutralization assay for either or both of EAvV-1 or EAdV-2. 5 EAdV is considered to cause a mild respiratory disease with fever, coughing, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis. Foals are assumed to acquire the infection from their dams, which secrete the environmentally stable virus in nasal discharge, urine, and feces. The virus is not associated with inflammatory airway disease in racehorses in England, but it has been associated with small outbreak of upper respiratory tract disease.",

These amino acid substitutions alter the charge, acquisition of glycosylation sites, and/or receptor binding avidity of the virus and hence its biologic activity including infectivity, immunogenicity, and virulence. 11 Hemagglutination inhibition assay (HI) has been used to type viruses, but this is now being complemented by genetic testing and determination of amino acid composition of major antigens (HA and NA). For instance, the amino acid composition of clade 1 and clade 2 viruses differs by at least seven amino acids in the HA1 domain of hemagglutinin. 23 Information about EIV strains changes constantly and is available at the equiflunet or OIE websites. 12, 13 The existence of lineages and strains of virus is important in the epidemiology of the disease because the antigenic differences among strains can be sufficient to prevent cross-protection provided by natural infection or vaccination. Cross-protection refers to the ability of one antigen (virus strain) to produce immunity in the horse against infection with another type of antigen (virus strain). Infection or challenge with the same type of antigen is referred to as homologous challenge, whereas that with a different antigenic type is referred to as heterologous challenge. Strains of influenza virus circulate between and among populations of horses, with more than one strain of virus circulating at any one time in some horse populations, although individual disease outbreaks are associated with a single viral strain. Many, but not all, of these virus strains are constantly evolving, and evolution of the viruses is necessary for perpetuation of cycles of infection through the emergence, or reemergence by cycling, of heterologous strains. Evolutionary stasis, the continued circulation of older strains of virus, occurs and has importance for vaccine composition for many diseases, but not, apparently, for equine influenza virus (EIV), where emergence of new strains is common and of great importance for control of the disease. Evolution of strains of equine H3N8 virus occurs through antigenic drift. Antigenic drift, the accumulation of point mutations in the gene coding for the major surface protein hemagglutinin, occurs continuously in virus circulating in horse populations. Antigenic drift occurs most rapidly in hemagglutinin protein but also occurs in M and NS genes. Antigenic drift, by producing heterologous viral strains, contributes to the continuing susceptibility of horses to infection and the reduced efficacy of some vaccines. 11 For example, the 2007 outbreak of equine influenza in Japan in a population of vaccinated horses, was associated with the Florida clade 1 virus, whereas the vaccines in use at that time included viruses of Eurasian and American (Argentinian) strains. 24 Antigenic shift is an event in which there is a dramatic alteration in the viral genome occurring by reassortment of viral genes during coinfection of a cell by two different types of virus (for example infection of a pig by both avian and human influenza viruses). Antigenic shift, which has not been documented for influenza viruses infecting horses, has the potential to produce new viruses with markedly different host infectivity and pathogenicity to either parent virus.",

This pattern of multiple variants infecting one horse and being transmitted to other horses results in a relatively large number of variants of the virus in a group of horses during an outbreak, constituting a loose bottleneck to viral evolution. 25, 26 Of the two serologically distinct subtypes of equine influenza virus, all reported outbreaks in the past three decades have been associated with strains of EIV-A/H3N8. There are no reports of disease associated with EIV-A/H7N7 in the past 35 years, and reports of seroconversion might be related to use of vaccines containing EIV-A/H7N7 antigen. There are no reports of other influenza viruses, such as the H1N1 avian virus, causing disease in horses, although the avian-like influenza A/I/Jilin89 (H3N8) caused severe disease and high mortality among horses in China in 1989 and there is a single report of avian H5N1 being isolated from sick horses, which also had serologic evidence of exposure to the virus, in Egypt during an outbreak of the disease in birds. 2 Equine influenza H3N8 virus can infect dogs and cause serious disease and death. 3, 4 Canine influenza virus infection, which originated in horses, is now endemic in dogs populations in much of the world. 3 Dogs are also susceptible to infection with equine influenza virus (Florida clade 1) when in close contact with horses infected with, and clinically ill from, the virus. 5 Equine influenza virus H3N8 was isolated from one of ~400 healthy Bactrian camels sampled in Mongolia. 6 The H3N8 virus can infect pigs but is not associated with disease; 7 seals, in which it can cause a fatal respiratory disease; and birds. 8, 9 Experimental infection of cats with equine N3H8 influenza virus causes respiratory disease, and the infection can spread to in-contact cats. 10 Canine influenza, N3N8, which is of equine origin, does not appear to pose a zoonotic risk. 10 At this time, equine H3N8 virus does not appear to be an important zoonotic threat.",

It subsequently became widely distributed, appearing in the United Kingdom in 1965, and evolved into multiple lineages and sublineages. There are two major lineages of EIV-H3N8 that circulate in horse populations-a Eurasian lineage and an American lineage (the names of which do not reflect the current geographic distribution of the viruses). This divergence in the virus occurred in the early 1980s, and there has been subsequent evolution of the American lineage into Kentucky, Argentinian, and Florida sublineages, with the Florida sublineage composed of two clades-clade 1 and clade 2 ( Fig. 12-31) . 11 For purposes of vaccine production, clade 1 is represented by A/eq/South Africa/04/2003-like or A/eq/ Ohio/2003-like viruses, and clade 2 is represented by A/eq/Richmond/1/2007-like viruses. 12, 13 The predominating virus lineage or strain varies from year to year and from region to region. Both of Florida clades currently cocirculate and coevolve worldwide. Viruses Persistence in the Environment According to the Ausvet Plan, equine influenza virus is inactivated by exposure to ultraviolet light for 30 minutes, by heating at 50\u00b0 C (122 F) for 30 minutes, and by ether and acid (pH 3) treatment. 27 Exposure to sunlight for 15 minutes at 15\u00b0 C (59 F) also inactivates the virus. The virus persists in canal water (pH 6.9) for up to 18 days at 22\u00b0 C (72 F) and 14 days at 37\u00b0 C (98.6 F); in tap water (pH 7.0) for 14 days at 4\u00b0 C (42 F) and up to 2 days at 37\u00b0 C (98.6 F); in horse blood for 18 hours at 37\u00b0 C (98.6 F); in horse urine (pH 8.0) for 5 to 6 days at 4\u00b0 C (42 F), 15\u00b0 C (59 F), and 37\u00b0 C (98.6 F); in soil under dark storage at 18\u00b0 C (65 F) for 24 hours; and in soil exposed to sunlight for 8 hours at 15\u00b0 C (59 F). 27 The capacity for the virus to persist in carcasses is unknown. 27",

Epidemics in Japan, Europe, and North America have been associated with introduction of a novel virus (for example, the 1963 appearance of H3N8 virus in Miami) or antigenic drift of existing viruses and resultant inefficacy of extant vaccines. 14, 31, 32 The epidemics in Australia (2007) and South Africa (2003) were associated with introduction of the virus into a na\u00efve and unvaccinated population of horses. 30 Localized outbreaks of disease in stables or race courses occur almost annually in countries in which the disease is endemic, likely related to the movement of horses into the training and racing populations, with subsequent introduction of virus and development of disease in at risk horses (see \"Animal Risk Factors\"). Disease associated with equine influenza virus usually occurs as of varying susceptibility there is a characteristic three phase pattern. The first stage is associated with the first cases of disease and slow spread over 10 to 14 days.

Survival of the virus on clothing and surfaces, including vehicles used to transport horses shedding the virus, can result in transmission of infection in the absence of horse to horse contact. Fomite transfer on veterinary clothing, equipment, or vehicles was likely responsible for the spread of infection from quarantined horses in both South African outbreaks. However, in most instances, horses are infected by other horses that are in close proximity or have physical contact, for instance, exercise ponies (horses or ponies used to accompany racehorses from the stable to the track in preparation for racing or training gallops) or stable mates. Aerosol spread occurs over distances of 35 m, possibly further (see \"Meteorologic factors\" on this page), and is enhanced by the frequent coughing characteristic of the disease.

The percentage of horses that had a high equine influenza antibody titer increased as the horse's age increased such that 45% to 51% of horses older than 5 years had high titers. This observation is consistent outbreaks associated with the introduction of virus into a population of susceptible horses. Virus may be introduced by clinically affected horses or, more commonly, by horses that are not noted to be clinically ill. Vaccinated horses can become infected and shed influenza virus while not becoming ill, 33 especially if vaccinated with heterologous strains, and this is likely a common method of introduction of virus into susceptible populations.",

After infection, protective immunity to homologous strains of the virus is present and persists for 1 year, possibly up to 2 years. Field studies of disease outbreaks indicated that the concentration of antibodies in serum that provide some resistance to disease might be less than that suggested from experimental studies. Protective immunity induced by natural infection is characterized by production of IgA in nasal secretions and IgGa and IgGb in serum, whereas administration of an inactivated, alum-adjuvanted commercial vaccine induces only a serum IgG(T) response that is not protective against challenge. Immunity after vaccination lasts for a much shorter period of time, 3 to 4 months, and is specific for the subtypes, and their strains, of virus included in the vaccine. Immunity following infection or vaccination is less protective against infection by a heterologous strain. Similarly, vaccination exposure to a heterologous virus may induce only a poor anamnestic immune response.

During the outbreak in Australia, the hazard of equine influenza infection was higher when relative humidity was less than 60% and lowest on days when daily maximum air temperature was 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0 C (68 to 77 F). 36 The increased risk of spread at lower relative humidity is mediated by both virion and aerosol droplet nuclei stability. 36 In cool, dry conditions, droplets are desiccated and remain small, which may stabilize influenza aerosols and facilitate longer range transmission, whereas at high relative humidity, the droplets absorb water and settle, thereby decreasing the time aloft available for dispersion by wind. 36 There was a relationship between the direction of prevailing winds and spread of equine influenza infection during the 2007 outbreak in Australia. There was a clear trend for appearance of newly infected premises to occur to the west of previously infected premises, consistent with predominant wind patterns. 37 It is likely that wind carriage of the virus facilitated dispersal of infection. In a cluster of 437 infected premises, 81% were not contiguous to a previously infected premise and the mean distance from newly infected premises to the closest previous infected premises was 0.85 +/-1.50 km, with a range of 0.01 to 12.94 km. 37 Wind speeds greater than 30 km per hour from the direction of nearby infected premises were associated with increased hazard of infection. 36 At wind speeds of greater than 30 km per hour, an aerosol of influenza droplet nuclei would only need to be stable for minutes to be able to infect horses on nearby premises. 36 This is consistent with spread of equine influenza virus over 1 to 2 km, or possibly up to 13 km, via wind-borne aerosol. 37, 38 Economic Importance Influenza causes minimal loss through death of horses, but it causes much inconvenience in racing stables because it occurs in explosive outbreaks and affected horses have to break training. Such outbreaks have the capacity to close down the racing industry in a country for a period of months. An additional cost is incurred because of restrictions Death of cells is a result of influenza virusinduced apoptosis of respiratory epithelial cells and local and systemic increases in interferon and interleukin-6. Proliferation by opportunistic bacteria, commonly Streptococcus zooepidemicus, occurs because of the disruption of normal clearance mechanisms and can exacerbate the inflammation and cause bronchopneumonia. Viremia, if it occurs, is mild and brief, although it may be related to some of the systemic signs of the disease. Some speculate that myocarditis, myositis, and encephalitis occur occasionally in response to influenza virus infection, but definitive proof is lacking and was not evident in horses in the Australian epizootic 97 or in ponies experimentally infected with equine influenza virus. 99 Influenza virus has not been isolated from tissues other than those of the respiratory tract. Enteritis was reported in horses in the 1989 Chinese outbreak (Jilin/89), but is not reported for disease associated with conventional virus strains.",

The dominant sign is cough, which is dry and hacking in the beginning and moist later, and that commences soon after the temperature rise and lasts for 1 to 3 weeks. It is easily stimulated by manual compression of the upper trachea. During the early stages of the disease, nasal discharge is not a prominent sign and, if it occurs, is watery. There is no marked swelling of the submaxillary lymph nodes but they may be painful on palpation in the early stages of the disease, especially in younger horses. Limb edema or swelling is unusual in horses with influenza. Abnormal lung sounds, characterized by crackles, wheezes, and increased intensity of normal breath sounds, may be apparent in both uncomplicated disease and in horses with secondary bacterial pneumonia. Ultrasonographic examination of lungs of horses with influenza, even clinically mild disease, reveals pulmonary consolidation, fluid bronchograms, and peripheral irregularities. Tracheal aspirates are neutrophilic, yield heavy growth of S. zooepidemicus, and are consistent with bronchitis and pneumonia. Horses, unwisely, forced to exercise have reduced endurance.

            "text": "Measurement of antibody concentrations against the viral hemagglutinin antigen is important in determining susceptibility to infection, vaccine efficacy, and exposurefactors important in implementing control measures (see following discussion). Documentation of seroconversion, a three-to fourfold increase in hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titer, or a doubling in antibody titer measured by the single radial hemolysis test, in paired sera collection 14 to 21 days apart provides retrospective confirmation of the diagnosis. The single radial hemolysis test is more reproducible than the hemagglutination inhibition test, is the preferred test for determining concentrations of antibody against the hemagglutinin antigen, and better correlates with susceptibility to infection. 102 For the single radial hemolysis test, the virus is coupled to red blood cells that are then included in agarose. Wells are punched in the agar plate filled with test sera. Influenza antibodies then cause lysis of red cells, with the diameter of the zone of hemolysis proportional to the concentration of the strain specific antibody in the serum. Antibodies against the nonstructural protein (nucleocapsid protein, NS1) are detectable in horses after natural infection, but not after vaccination with an inactivated virus, thereby permitting differentiation of immunologic responses to infection and vaccination by canary pox-vectored vaccines, 74 but not by other subunit vaccines. 103 ELISA tests for detection of antibodies to equine influenza virus are available and have been characterized. A blocking ELISA for influenza A was accurate (area under curve = 0.993 +/-0.003 standard error), informative (z = -32.0; p < 0.0001) and had sensitivity and specificity at cut-point percentage inhibition greater than or equal to 50 of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.98-0.99) and 0.97 (95% CI: 0.96-0.98), respectively, and detected seroconversion as early as day 3 after onset of clinical signs and in 50% of horses by day 5. 104, 105 Other commercially available ELISA tests have similar diagnostic test characteristics. 106 Rapid Detection of Virus Rapid identification of the cause of the outbreak is important when instituting control measures. Timely demonstration of virus in nasopharyngeal swabs can be achieved by use of tests that detect viral antigen (ELISA or similar tests) or viral genome (real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction [rtRT-PCR or qRT-PCR]) or a reversetranscription loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay. Such tests can be invaluable in confirming an outbreak or occurrence of disease, in monitoring infection rates, and in achieving control. 54, 62, 65, 74, 76, 77, 87, 107 Detection of viral antigen by ELISA or similar methods and of viral genome by RT-PCR is not necessarily associated with shedding of live (infectious) virus (a false-positive test result). Both methodologies can detect nonviable remnants of viruses, often for long periods of time, and detection of low levels of viral RNA or antigen should be considered in the context of available clinical and epidemiologic data. Viral RNA has been detected in nasal swabs of horses for up to 34 days after natural infection, with RNA detected in all of 36 horses tested for the first 10 days after onset of clinical signs. 105 Virus can be detected rapidly in clinical specimens by a reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) test for nucleoprotein gene, hemagglutinin gene of H3N8 viruses and hemagglutinin gene of H7N7 virus. The rtRT-PCR is widely available, is the most sensitive of the currently available tests, and is suited for throughput of large numbers of samples when rapid decision making is required, such as during outbreaks of the disease. 87, [108] [109] [110] rtRT-PCR can detect virus as early as 1 day after experimental infection of horses, at the same time as virus isolation detected the virus, and before onset of clinical signs. 111 RT-PCR is highly sensitive and can result in detection of even very small quantities of viral RNA, such as can occur when nasal swabs are contaminated with inactivated intramuscular vaccine. 94 Recent development of field tests (on-site tests) to detect viral genome will further enhance diagnosis and control of the disease. The insulated isothermal RT-PCR (iiRT-PCR) method on the POCKIT TM , a fielddeployable device, is about 100-fold more sensitive than the rRT-PCR assay targeting the NP gene of EIV subtype H3N8 (Miami 1/63/H3N8). 112 The iiRT-PCR assay identified accurately 15 EIV H3N8 strains and two canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N8 strains, and it did not cross-react with H6N2, H7N7, and H1N1 subtypes or any other equine respiratory viral pathogens. There was 100% agreement between the iiRT-PCR assay and the universal influenza virus type A rRT-PCR assay in detecting the EIV A/equine/Kentucky/7/07 strain in 56 nasal swab samples collected from experimentally inoculated horses. 112 The utility of this test in field situations remains to be demonstrated.",

It has been validated for use in horses and is effective because of the conserved nature of the target antigen across influenza A strains. Results are available in as little as 15 minutes. The test had sensitivity of 68% to 83% and specificity of 78% to 95%, compared with RT-PCR or virus culture. 113 Sensitivity was 54%, but specificity and positive predictive value were 100% compared with serologic diagnosis. The low sensitivity compared with serology was ascribed to inadequate collection of nasopharyngeal swabs, or collection of samples when horses were not excreting virus. The high specificity and positive predictive value of the test mean that a positive result confirms the diagnosis of influenza infection. The relatively low specificity means that samples should be collected from a number of horses in various stages of the disease. Nasopharyngeal swabs should be collected by inserting a cotton gauze swab approximately 30 cm (12 in.) into the nostril or, preferably, nasopharynx of an adult horse and leaving it in place for 60 seconds. The swab should then be transferred to specialized transport media and shipped to the laboratory.",

However, NSAIDs should be used judiciously, as their analgesic properties may mask signs of expected to confer immunity to clinical disease when properly applied. 1, 33, 102, 119, [127] [128] [129] Reports of vaccine failure might in actuality be failures of vaccination programs. 118 Vaccination does not induce sterile immunity to equine influenza virus, and this is important in understanding of the epidemiology and control of the clinical disease. 27, 33, 115 The extent of cross-protection against infection and/or disease by each of two influenza virus strains depends on the antigenic distance between the strains (see Fig. 12-31 ). 1 Infection by equine influenza virus or vaccination using an effective vaccine can induce immunity and resistance to infection and development of disease as a result of a homologous virus. For example, vaccination with an inactivated Florida clade 2 virus, or vaccine containing the relevant HA antigen, confers considerable resistance to infection by a Florida clade 2 strain of the virus, but limited immunity, or immunity only at peak antibody titers, to infection by a Eurasian lineage virus or a Florida clade 1 virus. 102 Therefore, the level of protection provided by vaccines is often critically dependent on how closely the vaccine strain matches the virus encountered by the horse. This phenomenon is the basis for the recommendation that contemporary vaccines contain both Florida clade 1 (A/equi2/South Africa/4/03 or Ohio/03) and a clade 2 (Richmond/1/07) virus strains or HA antigens. 12, 13, 118 A large number of vaccines to prevent disease as a result of infection by equine influenza virus and recommendations for vaccination programs are available. 12, 13, 118, 130, 131 These include vaccines that include whole inactivated virus or viruses, 110, 126 virus subunits (e.g., HA protein) either as the purified protein or in a live vector (canary pox), 122, 123, 129 and vaccines containing various adjuvants and immune stimulating complexes, 132 or live attenuated virus for intranasal administration. 119, 133 There are numerous reports of the efficacy of one or more of these vaccines. 33, 103, 110, [119] [120] [121] [122] [123] [124] [125] [126] [127] 129, [132] [133] [134] A comparison of each vaccine is beyond the scope of this text, but several principles should be considered when selecting a vaccine: the vaccine should induce a measurable immune response and demonstrable protection against disease (natural or experimental), it should contain pertinent viral strains, it should be safe, and it should be practical (i.e., readily administered). Ideally, it should be possible to differentiate naturally infected horses from those that are seropositive as a result of vaccination.",

Failure of a commercial inactivated virus multivalent vaccine to induce detectable increases in antibody concentration in Thoroughbred racehorses was associated with lack of protection against natural infection by a heterologous influenza virus. It is important to reiterate that resistance to disease after vaccination or natural infection is greatest for homologous virus and less for challenge by heterologous virus.

This aim includes two components-induction of herd immunity by widespread vaccination of almost all horses in a population and induction of protective immunity in individual horses. 102, 118 The first aim is actually more difficult to achieve because of the perception by horse owners in enzootic areas that influenza is not an important disease or that their horse(s) are not at risk and the inability of regulators to mandate vaccination on a country-wide scale. 118 The result is that an insufficient proportion of horses in a population are vaccinated to confer herd immunity on the population as a whole, with consequential localized outbreaks or epizootics of the disease. 102, 118 Induction of protective immunity in individual horses through vaccination is achievable with certain limitations. Immunity induced by vaccination, especially vaccination using inactivated virus, is not as durable as that conferred by natural infection, nor does it induce the same type of immune response, 1 although this might not apply for modified live vaccines. 119 Furthermore, many factors influence the onset, duration, spectrum, and efficacy of vaccination programs, including the product administered, frequency of administration, frequency with which different equine influenza vaccines are administered to horses, age, and sex.

H7N7 virus is no longer a cause of clinical disease, and it should not be included in contemporary vaccines. Inclusion of antigen from both American and Eurasian lineages of H3N8 virus is essential, and vaccine composition should be regularly updated to reflect those viruses currently circulating in the horse population. The vaccine must include an adequate amount of antigen, measured by the single radial diffusion assay, preferably, the single radial hemolysis assay, because there is a clear relationship between dose of antigen and magnitude and duration of antibody response. There is increasing concern, and some evidence, that inclusion of multiple antigens in vaccines (for example, tetanus toxoid, equine herpesvirus, encephalomyelitis virus) reduces the efficacy of influenza vaccines. Although this concern has yet to be proved conclusively, it should be borne in mind when formulating vaccine programs for horses at high risk of influenza.",

The recombinant virus expresses the hemagglutinin gene of both Florida clade 1 H3N8-Ohio/03 and Florida clade 2 H3N8-Richmond/1/07. 13 The canary pox infection of the host cell is abortive, with no virus produced, but influenza viral gene is expressed and presented through MHC class 1 by the host cell, with subsequent induction of an immune response. A form of this vaccine, including both European and American lineages, was used to aid in the control of the 2003 influenza outbreak in South Africa and the 2007 epizootic in Australia. 63 An advantage of use of this vaccine is the ability to differentiate vaccinated horses from horses that seroconvert as a result of natural infection. This is achieved by detection of antibodies to both HA and internal viral proteins (NP) in naturally infected horses and only antibodies to HA in vaccinated horses. 54, 74 There are variations of this testing, based on the same principle of differential induction of antibodies, that can differentiate infected horses from those receiving an inactivated virus vaccine.",

Ring vaccination was implemented through the creation of vaccination buffer zones 10-km wide or wider around foci of infection where lateral spread of infection was occurring. Predictive vaccination was used where there were large accumulations of horses and/or movement of personnel or fomites (vehicles) in contact with horses.

The presence of even small amounts of maternally derived antibody interferes with the immune response of foals to vaccination. Furthermore, vaccination of foals while they continue to have passive immunity can result in impaired responses to subsequent vaccinations. The practical significance of this latter observation is unknown but because of its potential importance should be considered when developing vaccination protocols for foals. Therefore vaccination of foals born to mares vaccinated more than once yearly should be delayed until the foals are at least 24 weeks of age when the immunity resulting from the vaccination is much better; this might leave some foals unprotected because passively acquired immunity is short lived, and some foals of recently vaccinated dams are seronegative by 4 weeks of age. Foals of unvaccinated mares can be vaccinated at less than 1 month of age. Vaccinations are carried out at 6-to 12-week intervals for at least two injections. Subsequently, booster injections are given at least once a year, although more frequent vaccination confers a greater immunity.",

For yearlings entering training the important predictors of antibody titer before vaccination on arrival at the stable were the time since a previous vaccination, total number of previous vaccinations, and the age at first vaccination.

The most common introduction of infection, especially internationally, is through importation of subclinically infected horses. Also, because vaccinated animals can be infected and be shedding virus but not have signs of infection, isolation of introduced animals is an essential precaution, especially when an outbreak is in progress. The period of isolation should be at least 21 days and ideally 28 days. 115 The degree of isolation required cannot be specified because of lack of basic information, but it is suggested that droplet infection can occur over a distance of 32 m and windborne spread of up to 13 km. 38 There should be maximum biosecurity with regard to clothing, utensils, and personnel because this is effective in preventing spread of infection. 86, 89 It is important to recognize that abrupt imposition of quarantine and \"standstill\" of horses during an epizootic of the disease is associated with considerable psychological, emotional, logistic, and economic impact to owners, trainers, and horse-related businesses. [50] [51] [52] 57, 60, 66, 80, 93 Control measures during an outbreak are intended to eliminate sources of infection, reduce transmission of virus, enhance the resistance of at-risk horses, and decrease the number of horses at risk. Infected horses (identified by stall-side or rapid laboratory tests), and clinically affected horses should be removed from the group and isolated for 3 to 4 weeks. Ventilation of shed rows and barns should be optimal to minimize aerosol spread of the virus. No horses should be introduced or allowed to leave until the outbreak is over, probably about 4 weeks after the first case is identified. Movement of horses between barns or paddocks should be avoided. Training and racing should be suspended. The opportunity for fomite transfer on clothing, tack, feed utensils, or vehicles should be minimized by strict hygiene. Vaccination of clinically normal horses in the face of an outbreak can enhance the immunity of at-risk horses and is probably safe.",

            "text": "The equine rhinitis viruses are ubiquitous in populations of horses. Infection has been associated with mild respiratory disease, although their role in the common infectious respiratory diseases of horses is uncertain. The equine rhinitis viruses are of four types-ERAV-1 and ERBV-1, 2, and 3. Equine rhinitis A virus (formerly equine rhinovirus-1) is a species within the genus Aphthovirus containing a single serotype, equine rhinitis A virus-1 (ERAV-1). There is little genetic variation in this virus. 1 The genus includes foot-and-mouth disease virus and bovine rhinitis virus, of the Picornaviridae. Equine rhinovirus 2 and equine rhinovirus 3 are now classified in the genus Erbovirus as equine rhinitis B virus (ERBV) types 1 and 2, respectively. 2,3 A third equine rhinitis B virus has been identified-ERBV-3. 4 The viruses are widely distributed in horse populations globally and infect substantial proportions of horses worldwide. For example, antibodies to ERBV were detected in 86% of 50 weanling Thoroughbred from three stud farms in Australia, with 48%, 10%, and 62% of yearlings being seropositive for ERBV-1, ERBV-2, and ERBV-3, respectively. 5 Fifty-six percent of the horses had evidence of infection by two serotypes, and 12% had evidence of infection by all three serotypes. 5 Others find similar seroprevalence for ERBV-1 and ERBV-2 in Australia. 6 Virus genome is detected by PCR in nasal swabs in a much smaller proportion of horses (0%-16%), suggesting differences in sensitivity of the assay, minimal or intermittent shedding of the virus or differences in the populations of horses sampled. [7] [8] [9] Serologic evidence of infection with ERAV is present in 50% to 100% of horses, although the prevalence of seropositive animals varies from almost zero in yearlings, to 8% in horses newly introduced to a training yard, to 61% in the same horses 7 months later. 6 Twenty-eight percent of 113 horses in Ontario with signs of respiratory disease were seropositive for ERAV. 10 ERAV is present in nasal discharge, feces, and/or urine of experimentally infected clinically normal horses and can be shed in the urine for at least 37 days. 11, 12 Virus was detected in 23% of 215 urine samples collected from Thoroughbred racehorses as part of postrace drug monitoring. 11 These horses were therefore presumed to not have signs of infectious respiratory disease, and this represents a shedding rate in clinically normal horses. 11 The importance of urine shedding of the virus in transmission of infection is unclear, although the inhalation of aerosols of infected urine might transmit the virus. The virus has been detected in semen of a stallion. 13 The role of ERAV or ERBV in genesis of respiratory disease of horses is unclear. The disease can be reproduced experimentally in seronegative ponies, 12 and there are a small number of reports of ERV association with respiratory disease, but clear causal association with common naturally occurring respiratory disease is lacking. High titers to ERAV are detected in horses with disease caused by equine influenza virus in Ontario, and it is suggested that this could be important in the development of respiratory disease, but without conclusive evidence. 10 The high prevalence of ERV infection in horses means that detection of the virus in horses with signs of respiratory disease could occur by chance in a proportion of individuals with ERV not being causative. None of 52 horses with signs of infectious respiratory disease in New Zealand had ERAV or ERBV virus (by tissue culture) or viral DNA (by PCR) detected in nasal swabs. 9 Similarly, ERAV was not detected in nasal swabs of any of 336 horses with respiratory disease (or in any of the 39 healthy controls) in the western United States, and ERBV was detected in 9 of 336 samples. 14 Although there is some evidence to indicate a causative role for ERAV and ERBV in common infectious respiratory disease of horses, the importance of the virus remains to be determined.",

Serum antibody levels to EHV-1/4 may be determined by ELISA, virus neutralization (VN), or complement fixation (CF) tests. The CF and VN tests are not able to differentiate between seroconversion associated with EHV-1 and EHV-4, whereas an ELISA using recombinant antigens specific for EHV-1 and EHV-4 is able to differentiate infection by each of these types of equine herpesvirus. Many, if not all, adult horses have serum antibodies to EHV-4 as a result of previous infection or vaccination. Thus the demonstration of antibodies is not in itself sufficient to confirm a diagnosis of the disease. Complement-fixing antibody appears on the 10th to 12th day after experimental infection but persists for only a few months. Demonstration of a three-to fourfold increase in the serum concentration of specific complement-fixing antibodies in acute and convalescent serum samples provides persuasive evidence of recent infection, albeit by either EHV-1 or EHV-4. Complement-fixing antibodies persist for only a short time (several months), whereas VN antibodies persist for over a year, and testing for them is therefore a more reliable means of determining that previous infection with the virus has occurred. Until recently, serologic differentiation of antibodies to EHV-1 and EHV-4 was not possible. However, highly specific ELISA tests based on the variable region of the C terminus of glycoprotein G, at least one of which is commercially available, have been developed that can differentiate between antibodies to EHV-1 and EHV-4 in horse serum. The ELISA is reported to be more sensitive, easier to perform, more rapid, and more reproducible than the virus neutralization test.

However, the use of rapid and innovative diagnostic techniques based on ELISA, PCR, immunohistochemical staining with peroxidase, or nucleic acid hybridization probes is often restricted to specialized reference laboratories.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Most cases of EMPF have detectable EHV-5 in the lung lesions or in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, the virus is most abundant in lesions compared with unaffected areas or lung from unaffected horses, and inoculation of healthy horses with EHV-5 derived from affected horses results in nodular pulmonary fibrosis. 6 EHV-5 antigen can be detected in lungs of unaffected horses, and the virus is widely distributed in horses worldwide, with both healthy horses and horses with evidence of non-EMPF respiratory disease having detectable virus in respiratory secretions. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] The ubiquity of EHV-5 infection in horses raises the possibility that infection with EHV-5 in horses with EMPF is coincidental and not causative or contributory to the disease. However, the almost universal detection of EHV-5 in horses with EMPF and the similarity of distribution of EHV-5 antigen in lungs and lesions of horses inoculated with the virus and naturally occurring cases of EMPF suggests a role for initial examination, but as the disease progresses respiratory distress develops in most, but not all, cases. The usual history is of a gradual onset of increased respiratory effort, although some horses have a sudden onset of respiratory distress. Heart and respiratory rates are often elevated. Pyrexia is not a constant finding and can be intermittent in affected horses. There can be a nasal discharge but this is not invariable or characteristic. Thoracic auscultation might reveal only increased intensity of normal breath sounds or the presence of occasional crackles and wheezes. Typically, there is tachypnea with an increased respiratory effort.",

The bats are seropositive for antibodies to the virus, the only seropositive mammals of 34 wildlife species sampled, and the virus can be isolated from pteropoid postpartum uterine fluid and fetal tissue. Mechanism of spread from bats to horses is uncertain, but it is speculated that ingestion by horses of infected bat fetal fluids and tissues might transfer infection from bats to horses. Fruit bats are consistently present when the disease occurs in horses. 6 The disease spreads from bats to horses, and there is considerable interest in determining risk factors associated with transmission. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Infection of horses likely involves contact with virus soon after (hours) it is excreted from bats. 9 This is consistent with the 40\u00d7 increase in risk of disease for horses in postal codes where fruit bats roost. 8 Serologic evidence indicates waxing and waning infection on a seasonal basis, and epidemiologic evidence and modeling favors an effect of anthropogenic changes in bat habitat favoring urbanization of bat colonies and also be hemorrhagic nasal discharge and swelling of the head. Some horses have muscle tremor. Death in acutely affected horses is sometimes associated with severe respiratory distress. Clinically inapparent infections of horses can occur.",

This concentration is greater than the concentration of voriconazole required to inhibit growth of filamentous fungi. 15 Localized disease can be treated by surgical resection and administration of antifungal agents. Antifungal agents reported to be effective in treatment of localized disease in horses associated with Aspergillus spp. include itraconazole (3 mg/kg q12h, PO for 3-5 months) or enilconazole (0.2%-2.0% solution administered topically via an indwelling intranasal catheter q12h for 2-5 weeks). The lesions were debulked before treatment with enilconazole was started. 1 Seven of eight horses with nasal aspergillosis treated in this way recovered. 1 Topical treatment with enilconazole (10 mg/mL of solution) after surgical resection resulted in resolution of aspergillosis of the frontal sinus of a horse. Topical administration of natamycin (25 mg) was used for varying periods of time to treat mycotic rhinitis in three horses.",

Bordetella spp. produce several virulence factors and toxins, which are regulated by a two-component sensory transduction system encoded by the bvg locus. These virulence factors include adhesins such as filamentous agglutinin, pertactin, and fimbriae; the adenylate cyclase-hemolysin toxin; and the dermonecrotic toxin. In cell cultures the dermonecrotic toxin stimulates DNA and protein synthesis and assembly of actin stress fibers while inhibiting cell division, resulting in polynucleation of cells.

Only certain porcine phase 1 cultures possess both properties. However, even the most virulent of 10 isolates of BB did not cause progressive turbinate atrophy or significant snout deformation in experimental infections. The severe lesions of atrophic rhinitis cannot be attributed to this organism alone. Experimental inoculation of specificpathogen-free or gnotobiotic pigs with the organism results in a nonprogressive moderately severe turbinate atrophy 2 to 4 weeks after infection, followed frequently by regeneration of the turbinates. These virulence characteristics of BB are consistent with the observations that in herds where the organism is common it can provoke sneezing and coughing but no evidence of clinical turbinate atrophy. Examination of the turbinates within 2 weeks after the sneezing will reveal some mild lesions, but no lesions will be evident when the pigs are examined at slaughter.

A number of field studies have found an association between atrophic rhinitis and reduced growth rate in some herds, whereas other observations were unable to show an association between the presence of the disease and growth rate. The lack of a standard system for evaluation of conchal lesions may be a factor in the variable results between observations. Some field studies have failed to show that the disease has an effect on growth rate in finishing pigs or that there is a cause and effect relationship between atrophic rhinitis and pneumonia. The presence of pneumonia in pigs from a test station reduced mean daily weight gains by 33% for each 10% of affected lung, but atrophic rhinitis did not affect daily gain and there was no association between the development of atrophic rhinitis and the development of pneumonia. Pigs vaccinated against BB had turbinate atrophy scores or mean daily gains no different from those of unvaccinated pigs. In another study there was a low positive correlation between the herd mean turbinate atrophy score and the herd mean percentage pneumonia score. A recent report from Illinois indicates that the prevalence of clinical atrophic rhinitis in farrow-to-finish herds ranged from 0% to 20%, and in pigs from those herds examined at the abattoir the incidence of turbinate lesions ranged from 5 to 92%.

The toxin is a one chain toxin of 1285 amino acids, and different domains of the toxin are involved in cell uptake and intracellular activities. The toxin is able to subvert cell cycle progression and cell-cell signaling systems in osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The toxin is the sole agent responsible for the conchal atrophy, and the effect appears to be related to the total exposure to the toxin; that is, it is dose dependent. The toxin PMT activates various heterotrimeric G proteins, which causes the deamidation of the alpha-subunits of the G proteins. [8] [9] [10] [11] More important, this also appears to have an immunomodulatory effect. There is an inverse relationship between the number of PM and the total concentration of immunoglobulin. This may in part be one of the reasons that local changes in the nose produce such adverse growth effects, and they may be a result of the fact that the PM type D toxin has in fact changed the immune functions and that the PM may have predisposed to many other agents. These authors' conclusion is that PM significantly suppresses the antigen-specific IgG immune responses of pigs to parenteral antigen challenge. The epithelium and the submucosa undergo secondary atrophy, and the conchae may disappear almost completely within 10 to 14 days. These lesions can persist until the animal is 90 kg in body weight. The conchal atrophy is not accompanied by an inflammatory reaction. The effect of the PM toxin is restricted to the nasal cavity; this is supported by the intriguing observation that the parenteral injection of the toxin into gnotobiotic piglets results in turbinate lesions and shortening and twisting of the snout. The parenteral injection of the dermonecrotoxin of PM capsular type D into specific-pathogen-free adult pigs will result in moderate conchal atrophy. In piglets 7 days of age, the intramuscular injection of the purified dermonecrotoxin will result in severe atrophy of the conchae. The culture filtrate of a nonatrophic-rhinitis pathogenic PM will not cause lesions after intramuscular injection. The disappearance of the conchae and the involvement of the bones of the face lead to deformity of the facial bones with the appearance of dishing and bulging of the face and, if the lesion is unilateral, to lateral deviation of the snout.",

In this way there is continuous medication of the sow and the piglets during the most susceptible period. For the breeding herd, sulfamethazine at levels of 450 to 1000 mg/kg feed, with the higher levels being given to dry sows on restricted feeding, has been recommended. Sulfonamide resistance has proved a problem in some countries but beneficial results may still be achieved with these levels. It is recommended that medication be continued for a 4-to 6-week period.

Eradication by repopulation with cesarean-derived stock may be essential in breeding nucleus herds where a high generation turnover results in a low herd sow age and a low herd level of immunity. The breakdown rate of herds established by this method can be significant, presumably because the initiating organisms are not solely confined to pigs.",

There are probably large numbers in the nose of affected animals. Abattoir surveys have found that the lungs of pigs from about 50% of herds monitored for several months may have lesions attributable to APP. This chronic pleurisy is presumably associated with APP. 2,3 Sero-epidemiologic surveys have found that pigs in 70% of herds may have antibodies to one or more of several recognized serotypes of the organism. The prevalence of infection continues to increase-presumably as a result of confinement rearing, crowding, inadequate ventilation, close contact, and commingling of pigs of various age groups. The incidence of clinical disease is much less than the prevalence of infection. In most countries, the more dense the pig population, the more prevalent the APP is likely to be, and this has been documented in Belgium. In the United States it may not be as important as in Eurasia, and it was not reported to be of major importance at the Iowa clinic. 4 In Europe, it may have become more common in recent years.",

The LPS causes an endotoxemia and reproduces certain typical lesions of the natural disease but not the hemolytic or necrotizing effects. Some LPS also help APP to stick to mucus, tracheal rings, and lung, but they do not surfaces.

In growing pigs the disease appears to be a respiratory infection without septicemia, producing a fibrinous necrotizing hemorrhagic pleuropneumonia with pleuritis. Early after intranasal inoculation the bacteria were mainly associated with the stratified squamous epithelium and detached epithelial cells in the tonsil. If only a few organisms are inhaled, probably they are trapped in the tonsil and remain there until they are activated. If large numbers are inhaled or if spread from the tonsil reservoir occurs, then a bacteremia probably results. Vacuolation and desquamation of the tonsillar epithelium was observed and there were many migrating neutrophils and these distend the alveolar hypoventilation are not features of the disease. The hematologic and physiologic findings indicate that the peracute disease resembles septic shock. Immediately after infection the levels of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 begin to rise. Moderate levels help in defense, but high levels make things worse. At the same time the IL-10 suppresses TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1 production in macrophages and monocytes, which up-regulates the other inflammatory cytokines. Pretreatment of the pig with IL-10 reduces the severity of the pleuropneumonia. The prolonged survival of APP during the infections may be attributable to the effect the organism has in downgrading the protective responses of the host.",

The latter is quicker, more sensitive, and more easily performed than direct immunofluorescence and immunodiffusion procedures. The coagglutination test is simple and rapid, the immunodiffusion test is considered to be the most serotype-specific, and there is a good correlation between the rapid slide agglutination test and the indirect fluorescent antibody tests. The rapid slide agglutination test is the method of choice of some workers, but the coagglutination test is serotype-specific, sensitive, simple, rapid, reproducible, and easier to read and interpret than the rapid slide or tube agglutination tests. The International Pig Veterinary Society has recommended that the coagglutination test is currently the method of choice for routine tonsillar crypts. They do not bind to the tracheal (perhaps in the newborn) or to the bronchial epithelium, but they can stick to the alveolar wall. 20 The ApxI of APP10 induces apoptosis in porcine alveolar epithelial cells. 21 The adhesion of bacteria to cells appears to be essential and seems to be mediated by polysaccharides and proteins. 22 The role of the fimbriae is not clear. Discharge of vesicles containing proteases and Apx toxins from APP1 has been described. Later the bacteria are associated with the crypt walls and detached cells in the crypts. Experimental aerosol exposure of pigs to APP results in a severe fibrinous hemorrhagic necrotizing pleuropneumonia that simulates the natural disease. The organism expresses a number of factors that help to acquire iron and it can use a variety of compounds, including hemoglobin. 22 Normally, the APP are kept out of the alveoli by the mucociliary clearance mechanism but not if there are large numbers of APP or there is preexisting damage to the clearance such as occurs as in M. hyopneumoniae infection. 12 It is a very determined battle in the alveolus between the APP virulence factors and the host defense mechanisms. The cytokine production excites the defenses and increases the permeability of the alveolar capillary walls and allows access of antibodies and complement. The macrophages need opsonins to help phagocytosis as APP is resistant to the action of complement. The Apx 1 toxin induces apoptosis in the macrophages, which are then killed by leukotoxins, and these then release further amounts of proteases etc. The characteristics of the pathogenesis have been described. [23] [24] [25] Within a few hours following endobronchial inoculation of various doses of the organism into 12-week-old pigs, clinical evidence of dyspnea and fever are obvious. An aerosol infection with the organism results in pulmonary edema with multifocal petechial hemorrhages and a diffuse neutrophilic bronchiolitis and alveolitis within hours of infection. In the lung, the recruitment of neutrophils is directed toward the viable APP organisms, and possibly 30% of the lung neutrophils respond. This is further enhanced by IL-8 activity. The porcine mononuclear cell phagocytic populations during inflammation produced by APP have been described. 26 The lesion is particularly marked in the dorsocaudal regions of the lung. The ability of APP hemolysin to debilitate pulmonary macrophages may enhance the multiplication of the organism, but experimentally the hemolysin of serovar 2 is not an essential factor for the production of the lesions. In the acute stages there are marked vascular changes in the lungs. The lesions resemble infarcts because of the vasculitis, thrombosis, and hemorrhage. There are many necrotic foci that serve as reservoirs of the organism in pigs that recover. In the experimental disease, the leukogram is typical of acute inflammation; however, hypoxemia and serotyping of field strains. This technique does not allow separation of the heterogeneous serovar 8 from serovars 3 and 6, the heterogeneous serovar 9 from serovar 1, or the heterogeneous serovar 7 from 4. The results are reported as group 9-1, group 8-3-6, and group 7-4, respectively. The final identification of heterogeneous serovars can only be achieved by the agar gel diffusion test and by indirect hemagglutination. Reference strains and the corresponding antisera are available to bring some uniformity into serotyping.",

Lesions may be present in 40% to 80% of the lungs of pigs at abattoirs. The peak incidence of pneumonia occurs at 16 to 20 weeks of age, which is likely related to the increased stocking density in this period. In northern climates, the incidence of clinical disease and prevalence of lesions at slaughter are higher in the summer months. The prevalence of lung lesions is often highest in pigs slaughtered in the winter months compared with autumnslaughtered pigs. The amount of bronchopneumonia lesions in individual lungs ranged from 0% to 69%, with an average of 7.8%. A 2002 survey in the United States showed that 82.3% of finishing sites had at least one animal positive on antibody testing and 94.4% of breeding sites. Seroprevalences were higher in the clinically affected herds, and most of the pigs were infected with MH at a younger age. A study in the United Kingdom showed that geographic location of the finishing unit appeared to be a statistically significant risk factor for EP-like lesions and pleurisy. 9 In addition, they also found that part-slatted floors were a potential risk factor. In a study of colonization at weaning and the infection at slaughter, average lung lesion scores, percentage of affected lungs, presence of MH on the bronchial epithelium, and seroconversion, it was found that the severity of the disease can be predicted by the prevalence at weaning in segregated systems. Strategies focused on reducing colonization at weaning may help to control MH in segregated production systems. 10 Vaccination does not prevent transmission to sentinel pigs in contact with infected animals. Transmission of MH from asymptomatic carriers to unvaccinated and vaccinated sentinels was not different. 11",

            "text": "The organism is an inhabitant of the respiratory tract of pigs, and transmission occurs by direct nose-to-nose contact, which is the main form of transmission. Airborne transmission and fomites are less important. Mycoplasma can be transmitted over 1, 75, and 150 m, and recently aerosol has been seen to be transmitted over 9.2 km. 12 M. hyopneumoniae was found to travel long distances from an infected experimentally infected group of pigs. 13 Airborne transmission was suggested on 80% of farms where acute respiratory disease was present. No airborne organisms were found on farms without acute respiratory disease. There is no other known host for the organism, although infection and breakdown of closed pneumonia-free herds has occurred without any pig introductions. The number of organisms required for infection is very small, and the possibility of wind-borne infection has been suggested. Transmission is by the respiratory route and in infected herds occurs primarily from the sow to the suckling piglets. In a study of shedding of MH in different parities: gilts were 73% positive, parity 2 to 4 sows were 42% positive, parity 6 to 7 sows 50% positive, and parity 8 to 11 sows were 6% positive. Generally, the nursery is considered the area where transmission occurs and infection spreads slowly. Within pen transmission measured by PCR is very slow. Animals can be PCR positive and not infectious for long periods of time and then can become very infectious up to 119 days, as has been recorded. 11 There is therefore a nonlinear excretion of MH. It is thought that one infected nursery pig will infect on average one littermate. Boars can also infect sows when they are kept together in service areas, but in these areas the disease spreads slowly. The disease is also transmitted and exacerbated during the grouping and stress of pigs that occurs at weaning. Transmission can occur as early as 1 week of age, but usually it is not observed under 6 weeks of age. 14 The highest clinical and pathologic incidence occurs in the postweaning and growing period, and in most herds this is maintained through the growing period to market age. The start of finishing is the critical point. Direct exposure (nose-to-nose contact) of pigs at 9 to 11 weeks of age to seropositive gilts results in seroconversion to the organism by 21 days and is most frequent by about 11weeks after exposure. The presence of gross lesions of pneumonia correlated with the seroconversion.",

In some herds, the risk of coughing and pneumonic lesions increased with increasing age of pigs within a herd. In a survey of two different groups of pigs slaughtered at different ages, the age-specific prevalence of pneumonic lesions was 2.7% in pigs less than 16 weeks of age at slaughter, but it increased rapidly when pigs were between 16 and 22 weeks of age at slaughter. Infection at an early age has a greater effect than infection later in life. Pigs coughing by 14 weeks of age were, on average, 6.2 to 6.9 kg lighter than those with onset of disease near market age. The highest seroconversion rate occurs between 3 to 4 months of age. In a recent experimental infection, 77.7% of the infected animals were still positive 185 days later, and 100% of the naturally infected animals were still infected at the same time. There may be selective differences in the colonization rates between litters. There may also be a sex effect on colonization. A longitudinal study of the diversity and dynamics of MH infection has been described. 19 In a study of a large number of sows in northwestern Germany, it was found that the risk of a sow being seropositive was increased in herds with two-or three-site production, when piglets were not vaccinated, when herds had 2-week farrowing intervals, and in herds without AI/AO management of the farrowing units. The lack of an acclimatization period for boars was also associated with the risk of a sow being seropositive. 20 Immune Mechanisms Pigs that recover from experimentally induced enzootic pneumonia are resistant to subsequent challenge. The nature of the immunity induced by MH, whether serum or local antibody mediated, T-cell mediated, or a combination of these factors, is not clear. Based on lymphocyte transformation tests of experimentally infected pigs, it is possible that cell-mediated immunity correlates with protective immunity. The median half-life of passively acquired antibodies to MH is 16 days, the persistence of antibodies is related to the initial antibody concentration, and antibodies waned by 30 to 63 days after birth depending on initial concentration. It has been detected as late as 155 days of age. The titer of maternal antibodies is a major concern when pigs are vaccinated. The age of the piglet vaccinated is not the key factor. The level of the sow's antibodies approximately 4 weeks prepartum are at their highest and similar to the levels in colostrum. Immunity is not conferred through colostral immunoglobulins, and thus piglets born from immune dams are susceptible to infection and clinical disease. No significant correlations have been found between the colostral antibody levels and the colonization status of the sows. The level of immunoglobulins to MH can be used to monitor infection in the herd. Pigs usually seroconvert to APP and then MH.",

MH may suppress alveolar macrophage function, which may predispose the lung to secondary infection. The organism is very clever in evading the immune response, probably by changing the nature of the immune response to one that is less effective. To do this it causes the production of cytokines IL-1\u03b1 and beta, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 by macrophages and monocytes and induces local inflammation.

Little is as yet known about the virulence factors of MH. A wide variety of proteins are produced. Mycoplasma have the smallest genomes of organisms capable of separate existence. This genome encodes for several immunogenic proteins including a cytosolic protein p36 (which may have lactic dehydrogenase activity); membrane proteins P46, P65, and P74 (can produce neutralizing antibodies); and an adhesin P97. The P97 adhesin mediates adherence of MH to swine cilia. An adhesin-like protein (P110) composed of a P54 and 2 P28 units has also been found. Attachment is a complex process involving many gene products. A recent study of the total protein profile, glycoprotein profile, and size differences in the amplified PCR product of P97 adhesin genes suggests that there is an intraspecies variation in the MH population in the United States. Combination with the P102 adjacent gene allows the two proteins to contribute to cellular adherence. 5, 6 A highly immunogenic MH lipoprotein Mhp366 was identified by peptide-spot array, 22 and this may be a useful method for detecting MH infections. The in vivo virulence of MH isolates does not correlate with in vitro adhesion assessed by a microtiter adherence assay. 23 These observations suggest that mechanisms other than adherence may be responsible for observed differences in virulence.",

If eradication by repopulation is intended, it is preferable to purchase pregnant gilts from established primary SPF herds unless the maintenance of existing genetic lines dictates otherwise. Before recommending eradication by this method it is essential that the pig owner understands the principles of this method of control and the restrictions that will need to apply if it is to be successful. Farrow-to-finish enterprises established by this method should be run as closed herds, and if further genetic material is required it should be introduced by hysterectomy techniques or by purchase from the initial source herd.

Also, the majority of breakdowns occur in herds that have not imported infected stock recently. In reinfected herds that imported stock there was no concurrent evidence of breakdown in the parent herds, which supported the contention that the importation of infected pigs was an unlikely source of the infection.

There was a small decrease in the number of days to market. It usually results in a 2% to 8% increase in daily gain. The mortality rate is usually only better numerically. Feed conversion efficiency increases by about 2% to 3%. Other limited studies indicate that vaccination can reduce the severity and prevalence of lung lesions detected at slaughter (4%-6% compared with 12% in controls). It improves feed efficiency and increases average daily gain during the finishing period. In other studies the average daily gain was not improved. Under experimental conditions the transmission in nursery pigs was only numerically lower in vaccinated pigs and the vaccination does not prevent the establishment of MH in the lung. 59 Vaccination of piglets improved pulmonary health, but vaccination of sows alone did not prove to be sufficient. 60 Vaccination of sows against MH reduced the prevalence of positive piglets at weaning and could be used to control MH infections as judged by a nested PCR. PRRS vaccination does not interfere with MH vaccination. Needle-less intradermal vaccination has also been described. Double-vaccinated pigs show a lower percentage of MH-compatible gross lesions and a lower MH prevalence in the URT compared with single vaccinated animals. 61 Both dual and single injection vaccines are available, but the protection obtained is similar.

This term really means pneumonia that occurs naturally in the population and includes a complex of many bacterial and viral agents with the occasional addition of parasites and protozoa.

In addition, studies on the association between performance parameters and the severity of lesions of the lungs have yielded widely variable results dependent on the management and environmental conditions and the different research design and techniques used. In general, there is a proportional relationship between severity of pneumonia and depression of performance but in other observations, this relationship was not found. Where pigs are raised under good management, infection of herds previously free of the disease has resulted in no adverse economic effect other than during the initial period of acute infection in the herd. However, in other situations adverse economic effects are associated with the disease. One study estimated a reduction of feed conversion efficiency as high as 22%, and although the effect of the disease is probably not this severe in most piggeries, a significant economic reduction can occur even under good management conditions.",

In general, the economic loss associated with respiratory disease ranges from a 2% to 25% reduction in average daily gains. Some methods have been compared and the most informative procedure is to assess the percentage of lung involved and calculate a mean value for the herd sample. The relationship between the weight of pneumonic lesions from pigs at slaughter and their performance indicated that within a range between 3.32% and 74.5% for the weight of a pneumonic lung, a 10% increase in the weight of pneumonic lung was associated with a decrease in mean daily gain of 31.4 g and a 13.2-day increase to slaughter at 104 kg live weight. There is a high correlation between rapid gross lung scores and detailed examination, which indicates that lungs can be visually scored accurately as they pass on a slaughter line. On average, mean daily gain decreases from 23 to 37 g for every 10% of the lung affected by pneumonia. However, the rapid subjective scoring of the lungs, adjusted for lung proportions, is considered adequate for estimating naturally occurring pneumonia and just as informative as detailed dissection of the lungs.",

Weight losses are more substantial in pigs affected early in life. In some studies, lung lesion scores detected at slaughter did not significantly correlate to growth indicators during any season. The gross lesions of mycoplasmal pneumonia heal over a 2-month period, which may explain why significant correlations are not found between growth indicators and lung lesions scores. The effects of the lesions on mean daily gains over an entire growth period may vary from one study to another because of the different times during growth when the lesions exerted their effects and in part to compensatory regrowth following recovery from the lesions. Radiographic examination of the lungs of pigs from 21 to 150 days of age, and gross examination of the lungs at slaughter revealed that lesions progress and regress dynamically throughout the life of the animals and examination at slaughter is an inadequate indicator of lifetime pneumonia.",

The three types occur together as in Korea. 1 Other types have been isolated from pigs, but as yet have not established as widespread endemic strains. Only influenza A viruses are important in pigs. They occur in a large number of species, including humans, primates, pigs, horses, sea mammals, and birds. Avian viruses are more stable than mammalian viruses, where the rate of evolution is much greater. Specific subtypes vary in their ability to cross species barriers. Specific gene combinations do have a part to play in influenza virus species specificity. 2 Unstable gene constellations in avian species become stable only in secondary hosts but may then adapt and circulate freely. 3 The methods by which they cross the species barrier are not well understood and are probably polygenic. 4, 5 An isolate of a Korean H1N1 virus was very similar to a U.S. virus, suggesting that it had been transmitted possibly by birds. 6 When new variants occur in pig husbandry they are usually found in the pig population before they acquire the ability to spread rapidly and become associated with disease. They are named using the following convention: A/species/localization/ isolate number/year of isolation, for example, A/Wisconsin/125/98. If no species is indicated, it is a human virus. They are described with reference to the hemagglutinin (HA or H) and the neuraminidase (NA or N) that project from the surface of the viral envelope. There are 16 HA and 9NA forms that can be distinguished antigenically and genetically, and all of these have occurred in waterfowl and shore birds. They provide a permanent source of infection, as does the water on which they float. The H binds to sialic acid and mediates the virus infection of the host and contains most of the antigenic sites. It is the viral receptor-binding protein and mediates fusion with the host-cell membrane. It is an alpha2-3-galactose linkage in avians and an alpha2-6-galactose linkage on the glycocalyx of epithelial cells in mammals. 7 The HA and NA are associated with receptor binding and virus release. 8 No combination of HA and NA has as yet been identified that will increase viral stability during interspecies transmission. The distribution of these receptors and the limited replication of avian viruses in swine complicate the picture. 9 The pig possesses both types of receptor and has therefore been considered as a \"mixing vessel\" because it can be infected by both avian and mammalian viruses. The N protein catalyzes cleavage of sialic acid and thereby facilitates the virus cell entry by degradation of mucins. The NA and HA are also the main targets of the host immune responses.",

The incidence for all three types was highest at the beginning of finishing in farrow to finish and at the end in finishing herds. 105 Risk factors include high pig density, large herd size, high replacement rates, and purchase of pigs. 90, 91, 106, 107 Young, growing pigs are most susceptible. The viral infection is commonly complicated by bacterial infection caused by Haemophilus parasuis, A. pleuropneumoniae, and possibly other opportunists of the upper respiratory tract of the pig. When an epidemic occurs, most of the pigs in the herd are affected within a few days, which suggests that all animals are previously infected and that some risk factor, such as inclement weather, precipitates the epidemic.",

Viral replication takes place in the epithelial cells of the nasal mucosa, tonsils, trachea, lungs, and tracheo-bronchial lymph nodes. No other sites have been detected, and viremia is of low titer. Inoculation of the H1N1 strain of influenza virus isolated in England from pigs with clinical disease into 6-week-old pigs caused fever, coughing, sneezing, and anorexia.

Both types have been detected in major porcine organs. 140, 141 In experimental infections, SIV was widely distributed in bronchi, but it was also present in epithelial cells of the nose, trachea, bronchioles, and alveolar type I and II cells in severely affected animals. The avian virus was found in the lower respiratory tract, especially in alveolar type II cells and occasionally in bronchiolar epithelial cells. Receptor 2,6 was the predominant receptor in all levels of the tract, but the 2,3 was found only in small numbers in the bronchioles and in the alveoli. The receptor expression of both types of receptors was reduced in influenza-affected areas compared with nonaffected areas. 142 The distribution of receptors is similar in the pig to that of humans, and as in humans, avian viruses prefer to infect the alveolar cells. The in vitro attachment of virus to the upper and lower respiratory tract tracts of pigs has been characterized. 143 The pathogenicity of SIV lies in its ability to elude host antiviral immune responses. In pigs SIV infection induced long-lived increase of CD8+ T cells and local lymphoproliferative responses. 144 The activation of cell-mediated immunity or cytotoxic Tlymphocytes depends on the efficient delivery of signals by antigen presenting cells. Dendritic cells are the most potent APCs. A study on porcine dendritic cells (DCs) has recently been published. 145 In one study, 146 it was shown that DCs could infect susceptible cells by close contact. The swine, human, or avian viruses differentially activate porcine dendritic cell cytokine profiles. 147 There is an important role for IFN-\u03b1 (induces fever and a transient rise in neutrophil counts) with IL-6 and IL-12 induction and an important role of these three cytokines in the symptoms of swine influenza. 148 There is a strong up-regulation of additional cytokines (IFN-\u03b1 and IL-12) and several acute-phase proteins during the acute stages of a swine influenza virus infection. These produce inflammation, fever, malaise, and loss of appetite. The depth of infection in the lung probably determines how much of these cytokines are produced. Contrary to widespread belief, there is no evidence that the virus causes reproductive failure in swine. The experimental inoculation of seronegative pregnant gilts did not reveal any evidence of transplacental transmission of the virus to the fetus.",

The virus is effectively shed from the nasal passages. Pigs infected with the pandemic virus mounted an early potent immune response, and it has been shown that such a response is associated with an increased viral pathogenesis. It also produced a higher proinflammatory cytokine response when given to macaques. 149 The PB1-F2, which is expressed from a +1 reading frame of the viral RNA polymerase subunit PB1, is able to induce apoptosis and promote inflammation. 150 Dysregulation of lipid metabolism also occurs at the site of primary infection. 151 The pandemic 2009(H1N1) virus was shown to be more pathogenic in ferrets than the standard seasonal H1N1 virus with more extensive viral replication taking place in trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles and the more normal nasal cavity. 152 The virus replicates to higher titers in the lung tissues. It showed less efficient respiratory droplet transmission in ferrets. 153 In patients with pandemic A (H1N1) pdm09, it was found that the numbers of dendritic cells and T cells were significantly reduced compared with controls. On the other hand, the frequency of natural killer cells and T-regulatory cells increased. The concentrations of plasma interferon (IFN\u03b1/\u03b3) and interleukin (IL-15) were significantly higher than in the control group. 154 ",

The signs have not changed over the 80 years. After an incubation period of 1 to 7 days (usually 1-3), the disease appears suddenly, with a high proportion of the herd showing fever (up to 41.5\u00b0 C [107\u00b0 F]), anorexia, and severe prostration. The animal is disinclined to move or rise because of muscle stiffness and pain. Labored, jerky breathing (\"thumps\") is accompanied by sneezing and a deep, painful cough that often occurs in paroxysms. There is congestion of the conjunctivae with a watery ocular and nasal discharge. Sometimes there is open-mouth breathing and dyspnea, especially if the pigs are forced to move. Morbidity is usually 100%, but mortality is rarely above 1%. In general, the severity of the illness appears greater than it truly is, and after a course of 4 to 6 days, signs disappear rapidly, depending, in part, on the level of colostral antibody. However, there is much loss of weight, which is slowly regained. Clonic convulsions are common in the terminal stages in fatal cases. The condition may continue to affect the herd for several weeks as the disease spreads, especially so if the herd is outdoors and the population dispersed. The new H3N2 reassortants in the United States have been associated with respiratory disease but also spontaneous abortion in sows and death of adult pigs.

One method of achieving this is to use truncation of the NS1 gene 200 that encodes an immune-modulating interferon antagonist. It replicates poorly but elicited neutralizing serum antibodies and mucosal antibodies and provided robust protection against homologous challenge given a single intranasal (IN) application. These vaccines provide in a single IN dose a better protection than an inactivated vaccine given intramuscularly (IM). A concern with inactivated adjuvanted vaccines is the phenomenon of vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. 186, 187 Another obstacle is the presence of maternally derived immunity. It can reduce clinical disease, but passive antibodies are less effective in blocking viral shedding from the upper respiratory tract because the main Ig in colostrum is IgG. Pigs with maternally derived antibodies have suppressed adaptive antibody responses to homologous infection or vaccination. This interference affects IgM and HI titers in serum or nasal mucosa. The cellular response is less susceptible to maternally derived antibodies. The perception is that live attenuated IN vaccines are less likely to be interfered with by MDA. 188 Virus transmission is reduced in neonatal pigs with homologous maternal immunity compared with seronegative neonatal pigs and pigs with heterologous maternal immunity. 189 Vaccine development has been described. 190 The genetic homology of the vaccine and the challenge virus is not the ultimate predictor for swine influenza vaccine performance. 191 Vaccination with currently approved commercial vaccines in the United States did not fully prevent transmission, but certain vaccines may provide a benefit by limiting shedding, transmission, and zoonotic spillover at agricultural fairs. 192 Vaccination decreases lesions and clinical signs and may eliminate virus shedding. 193 Vaccines may well reduce transmission but do not eliminate infection. 194 In the United States, a large number of producers vaccinate sows (~67%), and many vaccinate weaner pigs (20%). A large proportion vaccinated breeding pigs with autogenous vaccines, not commercial vaccines, and these by law are prepared by inactivating virus cultures. The main reason is that commercial vaccines are not upgraded fast enough. Vaccines (1) need to be developed quickly to keep pace with the virus changes, (2) need to have better cross-protection against new isolates, and (3) need to be able to overcome maternal antibody, which may negate vaccine use.",

It has the effect of causing lesions indistinguishable from those of atypical interstitial pneumonia. Other known causes of these lesions are 3-methylindole and the ketone produced by Perilla frutescens, Zieria arborescens, and one of the fungi Fusarium solani or Oxysporum spp. on Ipomoea batatas (sweet potatoes) tubers and tryptophan-containing plants. 1 Catabolism by the fungus of phytoalexins induced in the tubers produces four closely related ipomeanols: ipomeanine (IPO), 4-ipomeanol (4-IPO), 1-ipomeanol (1-IPO), and 1,4-ipomeadiol (DIOL). 2 These are not toxic until activated by pulmonary microsomal enzymes; 4-IPO and IPO are ultimately the most toxic. Experimental administration of infected potatoes to calves is associated with bronchiolitis and interstitial pneumonia. Unweaned, nursing calves may not be affected. 3 Animals are exposed to these toxins in a number of ways. Cows gain access to moldy sweet potatoes by grazing plowed potato fields or being fed spoiled sweet potatoes. The toxic dose is 7.5 mg IPO/kg BW, which converts to about 6 kg of spoiled sweet potatoes per adult cow. 1 The mortality rate is often high. 4 Perilla mint (purple mint or beefsteak plant) is widespread in the southeastern United States 4 and found in Asia and several other parts of the world. 1,5 All large animal species are susceptible, but poisoning is most widely reported in cattle. Cows are exposed by eating the leaves and seeds; toxicity is highest in the seed portion of the plant. 4 In a similar fashion, tryptophan toxicosis occurs in cows grazing on lush pastures with elevated concentrations of tryptophan. Outbreaks often develop several days to a week after cows are moved from poor pastures or forage to early summer pastures with high tryptophan content in the grasses. Rumen microflora convert tryptophan to 3-methylindole, which is then activated by cytochrome p450 in the lung to a reactive compound. 4 The clinical signs present in ipomeanol and 3-methylindole toxicosis are similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome and atypical interstitial pneumonia. The reactive compounds produced in the lung damage the pulmonary endothelial cells and result in acute pulmonary emphysema and edema. 1, 4 Affected animals have labored breathing, frequently standing with an open mouth and extended neck. Frothy foam from the nostrils or a foam-covered tongue may be present. Treatment is aimed toward reducing edema, supporting respiration, and reducing physical stress. Animals living longer than 48 hours have a good prognosis for survival. 4 are hot and humid. 1 Acute loses from hyperthermia or heat stroke may be mistaken for manure gas poisoning. 1 This is important for veterinarians because they may be called to establish a diagnosis that affects insurance claims for many thousands of dollars. Besides overheating and CO 2 accumulation, electrocution should be considered whenever there are large numbers of acute losses in a confinement building.",

Exposure to low concentrations of hydrogen sulfide over long periods is thought to be associated with reduced performance in cattle and swine.

Higher concentrations of ammonia (100-200 ppm) are associated with irritation to the conjunctiva and respiratory mucosa. At very high ammonia concentrations (>500 ppm), there is pharyngeal and laryngeal irritation, laryngospasm, and coughing. Concentrations above 2000 ppm can be associated with death within 30 minutes.

Vaccines have been unsuccessful.Mycoplasma spp. belong to the class of Mollicutes, a group of bacteria enveloped by a complex plasma membrane but lacking a cell wall. They are characterized by their small size, their tiny genome, and their intimate association with host cells that is essential for their survival. Mycoplasmas typically inhabit mucous membranes, including those of the respiratory tract, urogenital tract, the mammary gland, or the conjunctivae. 1 M. bovis is a major cause of disease of cattle causing pneumonia, otitis media, arthritis, tenosynovitis, keratoconjunctivitis, mastitis, meningitis, and reproductive disorders, including abortion.2  It is the etiologic agent of the so-called chronic pneumonia and polyarthritis syndrome (CPPS) of feedlot cattle that has been recognized in the United States and Canada.",

The disease must be differentiated from other causes of joint swelling and lameness in feedlot cattle. With M. bovis infection there are usually several animals affected in a short period of time, which serves to distinguish it from other sporadic causes of arthritis. Differential clinical diagnosis for respiratory disease:\u2022 Pneumonic pasteurellosis of cattle is an acute, toxemic bronchopneumonia with a high fever and a good response to treatment in the early stages. Depression and anorexia are common. The disease is most common in young beef and dairy calves that have been recently stressed following weaning or mixed in auction markets and shipped to feedlots. The disease can also occur in mature cattle as a primary or secondary pneumonia. \u2022 In viral interstitial pneumonia of calves, young and adult cattle there is characteristic dyspnea, a moderate fever, only a mild toxemia, and loud breath sounds over the ventral aspects of the lungs followed by crackles and wheezes in a few days, and recovery may take several days. Pneumonia attributable to BRSV may be mild with uneventful recovery or severe with dyspnea and subcutaneous emphysema and a high case-fatality rate. \u2022 Lungworm pneumonia occurs most commonly in young pastured cattle and is characterized by dyspnea, coughing, only mild toxemia, and a moderate or normal temperature; the course may last several days. Usually many cattle are affected. Crackles and wheezes are usually audible over the dorsal aspects of the lungs, and the response to treatment is usually favorable if treatment is initiated early when signs are first noticed. \u2022 Atypical interstitial pneumonia (fog fever) and atypical interstitial pneumonia of feedlot cattle. The former usually occurs in adult pastured cattle that have been moved from dry to lush pasture (or just a different species of pasture or on to a recently harvested cereal grain field); the latter is incidentally observed in feedlot cattle most commonly in the finishing period; the onset is sudden and some cattle may be found dead, whereas others are in severe respiratory distress with an expiratory grunt. This condition is usually not associated with toxemia.\u2022 Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR)is characterized by rhinitis, usually with discrete lesions in the nares, tracheitis, loud coughing, high fever, and no toxemia unless secondary bacterial pneumonia is present. Recovery usually occurs gradually over 4 to 7 days. \u2022 Contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP) resembles pneumonic pasteurellosis but occurs in plague form; there is severe, painful, toxemic pleuropneumonia, and the case-fatality rate is high. Differential clinical diagnosis for arthritis: \u2022 Traumatic aseptic arthritis may be associated with history of trauma and sudden onset of lameness without signs of systemic disease. Synovial fluid collected by arthrocentesis is colorless or yellow to red-tinged (as a result of hemorrhage). Synovia is clear with moderate cellularity.16  Culture of synovia is negative. \u2022 Traumatic septic arthritis with bacterial contamination of joint cavity commonly involves a single joint with worsening lameness. A skin lesion over the affected joint might be present. Synovial fluid is cloudy, with decreased viscosity, high cellularity, fibrin content, and a tendency to clot. \u2022 Septic arthritis as a result of hematogenous infection is a common complication of omphalitis or septicemia (e.g., diarrhea) in calves. Frequently involves several joints and is associated with clinical omphalitis. Common pathogens are Trueperella (formerly Arcanobacterium) pyogene, E. coli, Salmonella spp., Streptococcus spp.,",

A single dose of vaccine for M. bovis pneumonia, inactivated with saponin, provided protection against experimental challenge of calves 3 to 4 weeks of age with a virulent isolate of M. bovis. The vaccine also reduced the spread of M. bovis to internal organs. Attempts to vaccinate against M. bovis arthritis have been unsuccessful. Experimental vaccines against mycoplasma vaccines have been unsuccessful and may even exacerbate the mastitis. Currently there are several M. bovis bacterin vaccines that have been licensed in the United States for the control of M. bovis pneumonia in calves, and several U.S. companies are permitted to produce custom autogenous bacterin vaccines.

ETIOLOGY Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (once also called Mycoplasma suipneumoniae) is the primary causative agent. M. hyopneumoniae (MH) inhabits the respiratory tract of pigs, appears to be host specific and survives in the environment for only a very short period of time. The disease has been reproduced with pure cultures, and the organism can be demonstrated directly or indirectly in pigs with enzootic pneumonia worldwide. The isolation of MH is complicated by the presence of other mycoplasmas in the upper respiratory tract of pigs including M. hyopharyngis, M. hyorhinis, M. sualvi, and Acholeplasma species. The nonpathogenic M. flocculare also complicates the culture of M.hypneumoniae. The strains of MH are antigenically and genetically diverse. Multilocus sequence typing has been used to estimate genetic diversity, 1,2 and it showed that specific MH strains are responsible for local outbreaks as they are in geographic contact or operative contact.",

            "text": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is very common and largely influences the outcome of the disease in individual pigs. In some abattoir surveys of lungs, P. multocida can be cultured from 16% of normal lungs and from 55% of lungs with lesions resembling those of enzootic pneumonia. P. multocida and Haemophilus spp. may also be found in conjunction with MH in the lungs of slaughter-weight swine affected with pneumonia and examined at the abattoir. Those lungs with both MH and P. multocida had the most macroscopic pneumonia, and those lungs with either of the agents alone had much less pneumonia. MH renders the lungs susceptible to P. multocida colonization and infection.Along with MH, other Mycoplasma species, such as M. hyorhinis, Acholeplasma granularum and Acholeplasma laidlawii, have been isolated from the lungs of pigs at slaughter, but their significance is unclear. MH and Mycoplasma hyorhinis have been isolated from 30% and 50% of pneumonic lungs, respectively, from pigs examined at slaughter. MH was also isolated from 12% of lungs with no gross lesions of pneumonia. In a survey in Norway, MH, P. multocida and M. hyorhinis were detected in 83%, 43%, and 37% of the pneumonic lungs respectively. Most of the macroscopic pneumonia-up to 25%-occurred in lungs with all three pathogens. M. flocculare was the most frequently isolated organism in the nonpneumonic lungs.MH potentiates the severity of PCV2associated lung and lymphoid lesions and increases the amount and perhaps the presence of PCV2 antigen. It also increases the incidence of PMWS in pigs.Several environmental and management factors are associated with a high prevalence of pneumonic lesions at slaughter. They include continuous versus all-in, all-out production, open herds, large temperature fluctuations, semisolid pen partitions, and large numbers of pigs in a common airspace. These factors may operate individually or in combination synergistically. Housing pigs in a clean, isolated, disease-free and low-stress environment positively influences the health of pigs. Complex animal production systems in the industrialized world have been reviewed. 27 The primary and secondary pathogens of the disease produce their most detrimental economic effects and the highest level of morbidity and mortality during the finishing period when the economics of production necessitate indoor housing and intensification.Four main groups of environmental factors that contribute to high levels of clinical disease and lesions at slaughter include: 1. Meteorologic 2. Population and social 3. Management 4. Airborne pollution Meteorological factors include wide fluctuations in the temperature indoors, wide variations in relative humidity, irregular ventilation rates, and winter housing. However, experimentally, elevated concentrations of ammonia and fluctuating ambient temperature did not influence the severity of the pneumonia or its effect growth rate. The noninfectious factors associated with pneumonia and pleuritis in slaughtered pigs in 143 farrow-to-finish farms in France were analyzed. 28, 29 Population factors that contribute to an increased prevalence of pneumonia are increasing herd size, increased population density, and decreased airspace and floor space per pig. All management practices influence the microclimate, and the quality of housing and management influences the incidence of pneumonic lesions at slaughter. Larger-than-average swine farms milling their own feed and with characteristics of modern buildings (mechanized inlets, slatted floors) and in close proximity to other farms tend to have a higher risk of enzootic pneumonia. Extensively housed pigs with aboveaverage pen space and air volume have a reduced prevalence of enzootic pneumonia lesions.Management factors associated with enzootic pneumonia include family farms that feed pigs on the floor and feeder barns that obtain pigs from multiple sources compared with those with good facilities and where the pigs originate directly from breeding units. The disease is a particular problem in continuous-flow herds. In pigs reared in all-in, all-out groups in the farrowing house, nursery, and growing-finishing unit, any Mycoplasma transmitted from sows to pigs or between pigs do not necessarily result in clinical signs or lesions of pneumonia. Pigs reared in all-in, all-out systems do not have lesions or minimal lesions at slaughter and gained at a faster rate than litter-mate pigs reared in a continuous system. Risk factors in suboptimal housing in Australia were described. 30 In small herds, the factors commonly associated with a high prevalence of enzootic pneumonia were larger numbers of pigs per pen section, larger group sizes, and drafty farrowing and weaner accommodation.A study of housing density on species diversity and number of airborne microorganisms at fattening facilities has shown that the total number of bacteria and fungi did not exceed 10 4 and 10 3 CFU per m 3 respectively. The number of organisms correlated with housing density. The most numerous were gram-positive bacteria and then gramnegative bacteria and fungi. 31 Airborne pollution in pig houses is thought to contribute to an increased incidence of clinical disease and prevalence of lesions at slaughter. 32 The pollutants include microorganisms, endotoxic cell wall constituents, and ammonia. 29 Ammonia is the most important because it is a powerful ciliotoxic agent in its own right before determining its effects on microorganisms. Toxic levels of ammonia, high concentrations of aerial dust, and high colony counts of aerial bacteria may contribute to an increased incidence and prevalence of pneumonia, but these factors have not been quantified and are commonly based on subjective evaluations by the observer. A large study of 960 pigs has shown that there are no influences of ammonia or dust on the respiratory health of pigs. Environmental air contaminants such as dust, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and microbes in swine barns measured over a period of 12 months were associated with lesions of pneumonia and pleuritis at slaughter.In a study of experimentally infected animals, it was found that 6/114 long-distance samples were positive for MH. Three samples collected at 3.5, 6.8, and 9.2 km from the herd of origin were infectious. 33 In large herds, factors associated with a high prevalence were higher pen stocking rate, airspace stocking rate, and a trend toward higher atmospheric ammonia levels in the summer months. The trend to increased herd size has not been accompanied by the satisfactory control of pneumonia. It has been shown that pig-shed air polluted by alpha-hemolytic cocci and ammonia causes subclinical disease and production losses. 34 Combination and Interaction of Environmental Risk Factors A computer-based guide can indicate how the prevalence of the disease can be influenced by the combined effect of risk factors. The expected prevalence is estimated by consideration of 11 risk factors that include the following: 1.Number of pigs in the same room 2/3. All-in, all-out versus continuous flow of pigs 4.Type of partitions separating adjacent pens 5/6. Presence or absence of diarrhea as a clinical problem 7/8. Liquid versus solid manure disposal 9.Ascarid control efficiency 10/11. Presence or absence of active Aujeszky's disease. The temperature and humidity influence the penetration into the lungs of both primary and secondary pathogens by influencing the size of infected aerosol particles and the protective mechanism in the respiratory tract. Temperature and humidity also influence the sedimentation of infected particles in the air and the ventilation and stocking density. Pigs kept at high stocking densities and subjected to environmental temperature fluctuations, cold drafty conditions, and poor nutrition are more likely to suffer greater adverse effects from this disease.A reassortant of the pdmH1N1 2009 virus with an H3N2 virus from healthy pigs has been reported in Thailand. 52",

            "text": "Two H5N1 influenza viruses have been isolated from swine in Jiangsu Province in China, and the authors have suggested that swine are naturally infected with H5N1 virus. 220 This was similar to the situation in Indonesia. 64 Quite often these reach pigs from avians, particularly ducks, including H1N1, H3N2, H3N3, H4N6, H5N1, 64-66 and H9N2.H2N3 viruses were isolated from farms in central United States 67,68 and were probably of waterfowl origin. The ability of this virus to live in three different mammalian hosts suggests that it is well adapted.An H3N1 SIV has been isolated from pigs with respiratory disease in Korea 69 and also in Italy, 70 where the HA has been acquired from a human virus, and the other genes came from the currently circulating viruses in the swine population.Novel viruses can occur in pigs at any point in time. An avian H4N6 virus appeared in Canada in 1999 and was associated with a lake on which there were large numbers of waterfowl. Ducks shed large amounts of virus, and this can be recovered from lake water.An avian-like H4N8 SIV was discovered in southern China. 62 An assessment of the reassortant rates of the European strains of SIV suggested that there was one reassortment every 2 to 3 years, and we should expect these to occur in the future between the swine strains and the new human pandemic strain (2009). 14 A high level of genetic compatibility between swine-origin H1N1 and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza virus was shown. 71 The avian H5N1 viruses in birds in Indonesia have been transmitted to pigs on numerous occasions 72 but appear to become attenuated.H5N2 reassortant viruses have been characterized from pigs in Korea. 73 A serologic surveillance of H1N1 viruses in China showed that there was no naturally occurring H5N1 infection in pigs. 74 A highly pathogenic turkey H5N1 virus failed to infect pigs cohoused with infected chicks or chickens. 75 been described. 28 It has established itself in pig populations in face of relatively high levels of herd immunity to other viruses. In the Norwegian pig population, there was no prevalence of influenza until the infection of pigs from humans with (H1N1) pdm09. 29 The virus is a reassortant of genes from the most recent triple reassortant in North America and the European avian-like subtype H1N1 viruses. 30 The precursors of this virus may have existed in swine for a long time, which suggests that the evolution has occurred over a long period. 30, 31 A direct precursor has not been recognized. 32, 33 The situation was summarized. 34 It transmits very effectively between pigs. 35 The evolutionary characteristics of the H1 gene of the pdm2009 virus are different from the seasonal human viruses and the swine H1N1 viruses. 36 The pandemic virus seems to cocirculate and interact more intensely with the endemic SIVs lineages and gives rise, it seems, to more reassortants, the properties of which have yet to be seen. 37 A mono-reassortant of the NA from an H1N1 with the pandemic occurred in Hungary. 38 In a study in Germany, the N2 was from three different porcine lineages in an H1N1pdm backbone.Six new strains of the pdm-like (H1N1) 2009 strain of H1N1 were isolated and characterized in Poland. They belong to one lineage. 39 The pigs in finishing and growing sectors experienced acute onset of respiratory signs. There was anorexia, poor conception rates (50% lower), high morbidity (up to 100%), and low mortality at 2% to 3% in growers and 1% to 2% in finishers. At postmortem there were depressed, welldemarcated. pale purple areas of consolidation in all lobes.Novel reassortants have followed with this 2009 virus, and it was pointed out in 2010 that although the virus may be of swine origin. significant viral evolution may still be ongoing 40 and others starting with a 2010 virus in Hong Kong. 41 In this virus, only the NA gene of the 2009 pandemic was reassorted. A novel swine reassortant has been described in the United Kingdom with all the internal genes from the 2009 virus and HA and NA genes from a swine subtype H1N2 virus. 42 It is not clear if this virus can be transmitted between pigs. A novel reassortant has been found in Canada from ab H3N2 and a pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus on several pig farms and also in mink. 43 In another reassortant, the NA glycoprotein of the pdm09 virus has been replaced by the NA gene from either H1N2 or H3N2 European swine viruses. 44 Other reassortants of the 2009 virus have been discovered since from a variety of countries Italy, Argentina, Germany, China, Thailand, and the United States. [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] Nine reassortants have been described across the United States. 51 A H6N6 virus was found in swine in China and seems to have adapted from domestic ducks. 76 The isolation and characterization of two H5N1 influenza viruses from swine in Jiangsu Province in China has been described. 220 The H5N1 virus has spread to a range of avian and mammalian species but has not been fully characterized in the pig. Both swine viruses bound preferentially to avian-type receptors. The findings suggest that pigs are naturally infected with avian H5N1 viruses and are a potential zoonotic threat. In a study of enhanced infectivity of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in pig ex vivo respiratory tract organ cultures following adaptation by in vitro passage. 221 It was suggested that the mutations in the H5N1 virus may provide a replication or infection advantage in pigs in vivo and that pigs may continue to play an important part in the ecology of influenza viruses, including those of avian origin.An H7N2 virus was isolated in South Korea and was a recombinant from an avian H7N2 and H5N3 virus. 77 H9N2 SIVs have been described in China, 78 where the six internal genes are from H5 viruses and the HA and NA from the H9 lineages. In a survey in China, 54 genotypes were identified including 19 novel genotypes, 79 and there is a continuing evolution of these viruses. In this study, at least five antigenic groups were recognized, and during the period of 2002 to 2003 there was a considerable antigenic drift.Human H7N9 IV replicates in swine respiratory tissue explants. 80 Three Chinese isolates all replicated in tracheal and bronchial explants. These viruses were originally avian viruses that appeared in humans in China with over 130 cases, with a mortality of 32%. The surface proteins are probably from ducks and the internal genes possibly from chickens. There are two lineages reported at the moment. Collectively these viruses could lead to another pandemic. The infectivity, transmission, and pathology of these viruses in pigs has been described. 81 An H10N5 virus has been isolated from pigs in central China. 82 There is no evidence as yet that the \"bird\" viruses H10N8 and H7N9 poultry viruses that have killed people in China are as yet occurring in pigs in China.",

In a recent study in southern China, over 50% of the pigs tested had a HI titer to one or more influenza H1N1 viruses, and most commonly pdm/09-like viruses. One group had Eurasian avian-like swine H1N1 surface genes and pdm/09 internal genes. 50 The viruses were similarly widespread in Korea 88, 89 and also in Malaysia. 90 In Canada, 83.1% of the sows and 40.3% of the finishing pigs were positive for H1N1 91 but less than 10% to the Colorado and Texas strains of H3N293. In Argentina, over 70% were positive for H1N1 and H3N294. In Brazil, 46% were positive for H1N1. 93 Swine influenza first appeared in the United States immediately following the 1918 pandemic of human influenza (Spanish flu), and it was generally believed that it was caused by adaptation of the human influenza virus to swine. Nucleotide sequencing of the genes coding for the internal virus proteins indicates that the human pandemic H1N1 strain and the classic swine strain H1N1 have a common avian ancestor. It is suggested that a virulent avian strain H1N1 entered the human population in 1918, causing the pandemic. The pandemic virus was then introduced into the swine population, where it has persisted unchanged. In contrast, this classical swine influenza was seen in the United Kingdom in 1941 but then disappeared until it was seen in Czechoslovakia in 1950 and Germany in 1959. Influenza was not seen again until observed in swine in Europe in 1979, possibly following importation of pigs from North America, associated with a virus antigenically related to contemporary avian H1N1 strains found in ducks. These avian-like strains have been the most common since 1979.Swine influenza still occurs in the United States, and viruses of the H1N1 lineage were the dominant cause of SIV from 1930 to the 1990s. These were highly conserved (relatively unchanged), but new antigenic and genetic variants did occur. Classical H1N1 viruses have also been isolated from pigs from South America, Europe, and Asia. Wild pigs also have H1N1. In the 1980s there were many genetic mixings between avian-like H1N1 and human-like H3N2 viruses. In 1992 many outbreaks of classical swine influenza occurred in England, associated with a group of H1N1 viruses that were distinguishable from classical swine viruses, the European swine viruses, and human H1N1 viruses, all of which are known to be circulating in pigs. Influenza A virus subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 are endemic in pigs in Great Britain. Two distinct antigenic variants of H1N1 viruses have been associated with outbreaks of swine influenza, one of which was probably transmitted from birds to pigs in the early 1990s. The H1N2 subtypes isolated from pigs in Great Britain appear to have originated from a human H1N1 virus, which was circulating in the pig population in the 1980s, and from swine H3N2. It is suggested that the H1N1 viruses have disappeared from the human population, and the pig population provides a reservoir for the virus. Serologic surveys indicate that a swine H1N1 influenza virus has circulated in the swine population in North America for many years. Recent isolates from Quebec possess a hemagglutinin distinguishable from subtype H1N1.Transmission of viruses between pigs and humans and vice versa have shaped the current epidemiology of influenza viruses in North America.Epidemics of swine influenza have also occurred in Japan, Canada, Belgium, and France. In North America, human H3N2 have been found much less often than in the rest of the world, but the very recent introduction of H3N2 from humans to pigs was probably the major factor in the emergence of the recent strains.Mixtures of human and classical virus genes have been isolated from pigs in Asia and the United States. H3N2 viruses with human H and N genes and avian internal protein genes have been isolated from pigs in Asia. This type of H3N2 has been found in Korea and is currently the dominant H3N2 virus in pigs in Europe. Since 1998 double and triple reassortants have been isolated from pigs in the United States. The North Carolina virus had three human genes and five swine genes. They include human H and N genes, genes from swine H1N1 viruses, and two others from avians.All the reassortant viruses found in North America have the triple-assortant gene complex (avian PA, PB2; the NS, NP, and M genes of classical swine lineage; and the PB1 of human gene lineage). This suggests that this set of reassortants can more readily accept changes in NA and HA)Prior infection with swine influenza viruses is a barrier to infection with avian influenza viruses. 94 ",

The acute-phase protein(APP), C-reactive protein, and haptoglobin were raised 24 hours after the cytokine response, and the lipopolysaccharide binding protein only increased in the BALF. The findings suggested that IFN-\u03b1 and IL-12 play an important part in the pathogenesis of SIV and that APPs are induced by cytokines. 164 Acute-phase proteins and serum amyloid were raised when pigs were simultaneously infected with H1N1 virus and P. multocida. 160 Experimental infections with the human 1918 pandemic influenza virus produced only a mild disease and pigs, and they did not become moribund, whereas in other mammalian species the effects were lethal. 161 The findings suggested that the virus entered the swine population from humans and then established the classical H1N1 lineage in pigs.Experimental infection with H1N1 European swine influenza virus protects pigs from infection with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 human virus. 162 Experimental infections with the U.S. isolates of the p(H1N1) 2009 were described, 163 and all the pigs developed clinical signs similar to those induced by endemic SIV viruses.Within 24 hours of the onset of clinical signs there is a switch of cells in the bronchial lavage from macrophages to over 50% neutrophils.",

A tenacious, colorless, frothy exudate is present in the air passages. Copious exudate in the bronchi is accompanied by collapse of the ventral parts of the lungs. This atelectasis is extensive and often irregularly distributed, although the apical and cardiac lobes are most affected, and the right lung more so than the left. It may reach 50% by 4 to 5 days postinfection. The affected tissue is clearly demarcated, dark red to purple, and often reminiscent of enzootic pneumonia. Surrounding the atelectatic areas the lung is often emphysematous and may show many petechial hemorrhages.Histologically, in acute swine influenza the major feature is necrotizing bronchiolitis. There is a suppurative bronchiolitis and widespread interstitial pneumonia characterized by the early appearance of neutrophils followed by the accumulation of macrophages and mononuclear cells in the alveolar walls. After a few days there is a peribronchial and peribronchiolar infiltration of lymphocytes. In the variant of H1N1 swine influenza in Canada, there is more diffuse damage to the respiratory epithelium, resulting in firm to meaty lungs that appear thymus-like on cut surface.Microscopically, there is marked proliferation of type II pneumocytes, in addition to the presence of macrophages and necrotic inflammatory cells in the alveoli. The influenza type A virus can be demonstrated by indirect immunofluorescence staining using monoclonal antibody directed to certain protein parts of the human type A influenza virus. The influenza type A virus can be detected and differentiated from the virus of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lung tissue using immunogold staining.",

            "text": "Confinement housing of cattle and swine is accompanied by manure storage for varying periods of time, often in large holding pits under slatted floors. Oxygen is excluded from the storage so that anaerobic bacteria degrade the organic and inorganic constituents of manure, yielding hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, and carbon dioxide as major gases. 1,2 When diluted with water to facilitate handling, liquid manure in storage separates by gravity. The solid wastes form sediment, the lightweight particles float to the top, leaving a middle layer that is relatively fluid. Thorough remixing is necessary before pits are emptied to prevent the fluid fraction from flowing out and the solids remaining. The remixing or agitation results in the release of large quantities of toxic gases from the slurry. 2 Besides the well-established gaseous toxicants listed, certain other agents with detrimental inhalation risks are present in confinement operations and have been best characterized for swine confinement operations. Total dust is a major contaminant in swine barns 3 and may range from 2 to 7 mg/m. Particulates may adsorb gases and be part of the objectionable odors released and reaching neighbors near confinement operations. Respirable dusts may be 10% or more of the total dusts generated in swine barns. Such dust is contaminated with bacteria, fungi, endotoxins, and glucans. 3 Dusts are primarily composed of feed or fecal material. Both endotoxins and glucans have been suggested as potential contributors to swine respiratory disease and respiratory complications for workers in swine buildings. So far, however, high mortality and acute death losses in confinement operations are most commonly caused by excessive concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, whereas subacute or chronic irritation and disease of the upper respiratory tract may also be contributed by elevated ammonia levels. Methane is explosive and may act as an asphyxiant, but is not implicated as a toxicant.Additional factors that must be considered in a differential diagnosis include possible power loss during electrical storms or equipment failure; this results in the cessation of the artificial ventilation required to cool the building and exhaust carbon dioxide from the animals' respiration. In these situations, CO 2 levels build rapidly, and environmental temperatures increase dramatically as well, especially when weather conditions",

Congenital defects of the soft palate of foals have been sporadically reported; horses with minor defects can grow normally and may be able to have a successful athletic career for their intended use. 1 Hypoplasia of the epiglottis is detected occasionally in horses. Tracheal hypoplasia is recognized in calves and Miniature horses. Bronchogenic cysts are rare in foals 2 and calves 3 and result from the abnormal development of the tracheobronchial system during the embryonic period. Bronchogenic cysts can cause respiratory distress and dysphagia, particularly when located in the cervical region. Secondary defects, which are associated with major defects in other systems, are more common. Most of the defects are associated with defects of the oral cavity, face, and cranial vault, particularly cleft palate. Accessory lungs are recorded occasionally, and if their bronchi are vestigial, the lungs can present themselves as tumor-like masses occupying most of the chest. Pulmonary hypoplasia has been associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Retrosternal hernia (Morgagni hernia), which is a right ventral diaphragmatic defect, has been surgically corrected in adult horses as a result of incarceration of the large colon; in all cases the defect was thought to be congenital. 4 ",
