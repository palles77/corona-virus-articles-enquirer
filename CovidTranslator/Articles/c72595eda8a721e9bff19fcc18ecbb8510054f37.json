Given this 95 novel etiological agent, we wish to determine if symptom onset occurs at the time of infection, 96 infectiousness, or recovery (i.e., these are the three candidate models we wish to discriminate). 97 The model behaviours are otherwise assumed identical. To be emphatic, the underlying disease 98 dynamics is identical in all three models, each differing only in when observations are made, 99 corresponding to different timings of symptom onset (Figure 1a) . 100 101 We model the epidemic dynamics in households as a continuous-time Markov chain ( Figure   102 1a) (15).

Days 6-13 typically had little impact on model discrimination accuracy 199 (i.e., optimal Accuracy consistently levelled off as design size increased beyond 5; Figure 1d , 200 Supplemental Figure S3 ), and the optimal combination of these days varied due to stochasticity 201 in both training and test data. This is consistent with the feature importance used to develop 202 the heuristic (Figure 1b) , i.e., those days that were consistently optimal were those with highest 203 feature importance. It is remarkable that it is possible to discriminate models so accurately, given that they share 220 identical epidemic dynamics, and only differ in observation. The non-parametric nature of the 221 random forest is able to use small but clear differences between models (e.g., Figure 2c ) to 222 extract sufficient information to discriminate them. Combining the raw household data to form 223 summary statistics is critical to this: if the raw household data is used rather than the summary Figure 1 : (a) Model schematic describing: transitions between states within each household continuous-time Markov chain; the three observation models being discriminated between; and, the way that these household-level data are observed.
