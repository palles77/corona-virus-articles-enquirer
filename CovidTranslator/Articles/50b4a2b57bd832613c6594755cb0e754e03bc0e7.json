On physical examination, the cat was thin (3.6 kg body weight), but normally developed. He was hyperthermic (40.2\u00b0C) and mildly tachypneic (60/min). The auscultated heart rate was 180/min, and a grade 3/6 systolic and soft grade 2/6 diastolic murmur was heard over the heart base on both sides of the thorax. The peripheral pulses were weak bilaterally, but there was no evidence of arterial thromboembolisation on clinical examination. Passive hip movements were painful without specific location. The blood pressure was normal 1 (118/68 mmHg, heart rate: 159 bpm). Severe cardiomegaly was evident on thoracic radiographs (Figures 1A and 1B) . Pulmonary artery enlargement as well as dorsal displacement of the sternum (pectus excavatum) were also present. The electrocardiogram (ECG) had an abnormally widened QRS-complex (0.05 sec) with deep S-waves on leads I, II, III and aVF ( Figure 1C ), interpreted as atypical right ventricular hypertrophy pattern (RVH). Additional isolated premature contractions originating from the right ventricle were noticed. The standard echocardiographic examination 2 showed a dilatation of the right ventricle (RV) and atrium (RA). The thickness of the RV-free wall appeared to be normal. A large atrial septal defect (ASD) was seen and was illustrated by color flow Doppler as a low velocity (1.5 m/sec) left to right shunt across the defect (Figures 2A and 2B) . On M-mode examinations, the left ventricular fractional shortening (FS: 37%) and left atrium to aortic root ratio were normal (1.12). Serological test for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV antigen), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV-antibodies) and feline coronavirus (antibodies) were negative. CBC and serologic chemical parameters were normal.",

Dullness of the percussion sounds were noticed over the right thoracic wall, as well as a cardiac arrhythmia.

Cytological examination of the withdrawn liquid revealed a protein content of 20g/L and a specific gravity of 1.020, with non-degenerated neutrophiles, rare macrophages and monocytes, sometimes with erythrophagocytosis, and a few erythrocytes. This effusion was classified as a modified transudate, with mild hemorrhagic and non-septic inflammation, and was therefore compatible with congestive heart failure. The echocardiographic examination was quite similar to the previous one, but showed a more severe dilatation of the right ventricle and an additional aneurismal bulge of the upper parts of the right ventricular free wall, which probably had been present for a long time ( Figure 2C ). A diuretic (furosemide 0.5 mg/kg SID) was added to the treatment, and the cat developed mild prerenal azotemia (BUN 13.7 mmol/L, normal range: 3.6-10.7 mmol/L) without elevation",

            "text": "Right ventricular aneurysms are very rare in cats. Previous reports relate right ventricular aneurysm in cats with ARVC (arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy) 4 and left ventricular aneurysms with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. 5 The development of a cardiac aneurysm is supposed to be secondary to ischemic cardiomyopathy. In humans, a true ventricular aneurysm is most often the consequence of a previous transmural myocardial infarction, or can also develop in patients who sustained a blunt chest injury. 6 It is defined as a segment of the ventricular wall that exhibits 1B 1A 1C considerably smaller than the maximal diameter. 7 In our case, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and ARVC were excluded by the clinical, echocardiographic and the pathological findings. The histological findings in the aneurysm were different from those observed in aneurysms related to an ARVC, where fatty cells replace myocardial cells and where fibrosis extends in a \"wave front pattern\" from the epicardium to the endocardium. A pseudoaneurysm was excluded by the presence of myocardial cells in the wall of the aneurysm and by its broad neck. 6, 7 The presence of a primary ASD was severe enough to create a volume overload of the right ventricle, eccentric hypertrophy and intramural myocardial changes. The unilateral right-sided pleural effusion, observed clinically, was likely due to congestive heart failure. In man, unilateral right-sided effusions are twice as common (28%) as leftsided effusions (15%) and bilateral effusions are seen in nearly 60% of the patients in chronic heart failure. 7 Unilateral effusions are also associated with pericardial disease. 8 As fibrous adherences were observed between the pericardial sac and the right atrium in our case, pericardial disease could also have contributed to the effusion. On necropsy, there were no signs of pulmonary hypertension. The slight interstitial fibrosis in the lungs could be due to a chronic congestion or the consequence of any resolved inflammation. The pulmonary edema was interpreted as a sign of excessive pulmonary blood flow (increased pulmonary capillary pressure or \"overperfusion\") and 2C reduced lymphatic drainage (lymphatic insufficiency to remove liquid from the interstitial space).",
