            "text": "Background: Acute viral bronchiolitis is the leading cause of hospitalization among infants during the first year of life. Most infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis do not present risk factors and are otherwise healthy. Our objective was to determine the genetic features associated with the risk and a severe course of bronchiolitis. Methods: We prospectively evaluated 181 infants with severe bronchiolitis admitted at three hospitals over a 2year period, who required oxygen therapy. The control group consisted of 536 healthy adults. Patients were evaluated for the presence of comorbidities (premature birth, chronic respiratory disease, and congenital heart disease), underwent nasopharyngeal aspirate testing for virus detection by multiplex-PCR, and SNPs identification in immune response genes. Patient outcomes were assessed. Results: We observed association between SNP rs2107538*CCL5 and bronchiolitis caused by respiratory syncytial virus(RSV) and RSV-subtype-A, and between rs1060826*NOS2 and bronchiolitis caused by rhinovirus. SNPs rs4986790*TLR4, rs1898830*TLR2, and rs2228570*VDR were associated with progression to death. SNP rs7656411*TLR2 was associated with length of oxygen use; SNPs rs352162*TLR9, rs187084*TLR9, and rs2280788*CCL5 were associated with requirement for intensive care unit admission; while SNPs rs1927911*TLR4, rs352162*TLR9, and rs2107538*CCL5 were associated with the need for mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Our findings provide some evidence that SNPs in CCL5 and NOS2 are associated with presence of bronchiolitis and SNPs in TLR4, TLR2, TLR9, VDR and CCL5 are associated with severity of bronchiolitis.",

RSV infection ranges from a mild upper respiratory illness to severe bronchiolitis, which may require admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), mechanical ventilation, and possibly lead to death. Treatment is supportive (Meissner, 2016; Ralston et al., 2014 ; National Collaborating Centre for Women's and Children's Health (UK), 2015). Globally, RSV is estimated to cause 66,000 to 199,000 deaths per year among children younger than five years of age (Meissner, 2016) .

The diagnosis of bronchiolitis was based on clinical data, using the most widely accepted definition, which considers it to be the first episode of acute respiratory distress with wheezing, preceded by upper airway symptoms such as rhinorrhea and cough, with or without fever, in children under 2 years of age (Ralston et al., 2014) . The severe bronchiolitis criterion was oxygen saturation < 92%. Patients with this condition were admitted for oxygen therapy (Ralston et al., 2014) . Patients with previous wheezing were excluded. Patients were admitted in ICU when oxygen saturation remains < 92% even with the patient getting inspired oxygen fraction > 60%. Patients were submitted to mechanical ventilation if arterial partial pressure of oxygen were < 60 mm Hg or arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide were > 50 mm Hg in arterial blood gas analysis.

The study of ancestry was not performed due to the high cost of analysis.

For example, regarding one hypothetic SNP with the allele 1 (A1) and allele 2 (A2), we performed the allelic analysis + all genotypes comparisons [(i) A1A1 versus A1A2 versus A2A2; (ii) A1A1 versus A1A2 + A2A2; (iii) A1A1 + A1A2 versus A2A2; (iv) A1A2 versus A1A1 + A2A2]. We chose to present only the associations with P value < 0.05. (b) Models for calculation of OR in the presence of codominance: OR was calculated for the three possibilities when P value were < 0.05 for co-dominant model: (i) A1A1 versus A1A2 + A2A2; (ii) A1A1 + A1A2 versus A2A2; (iii) A1A2 versus A1A1 + A2A2. (c) Overdominance analysis: The overdominance analysis was made considering the important contribution of heterozygous genotype in maintaining the prevalence of several diseases studied in the literature, including cancer and asthma. Although many studies have reported the importance of the heterozygous genotype prevalence of different diseases, the role of heterozygosis is not well known in many cases and needs to be better understood by genetic association studies in different populations. (d) Bonferroni correction: Association studies, including genetic variables, environmental variables (such as viral identification) and clinical data of patients and healthy controls allow the possibility of performing multiple comparisons. Bonferroni correction is a method employed to minimize the effect of multiple comparisons and the presence of false positives. We tested 16 SNPs but two showed no amplification, so Bonferroni correction was applied and correction of the P value was carried out by multiplying by 14 (\u03b1 = 0.05/14). The Bonferroni correction method for multiple testing was published in 1935. Even with wide applicability and use, some authors consider unnecessary to carry out this correction, so we decided to present both data (corrected and uncorrected).",

SNPs rs1065341 and rs2280788 (CCL5) are not in HWE for patients and controls subjects. Moreover, SNP rs1060826 (NOS2) is not in HWE only for controls subjects. Fig. 1 and Table 4 show association between polymorphisms and the presence of bronchiolitis for different types of virus. The evaluation of the presence of bronchiolitis for different types of virus revealed an association between SNP rs2107538*CT (CCL5) and bronchiolitis caused by RSV (OR = 1.646; 95%CI = 1.054 to 2.57) and RSV subtype A (OR = 1.754; 95%CI = 1.06 to 2.902) specifically, and between SNP rs1060826*GG (NOS2) and bronchiolitis caused by rhinovirus (OR = 2.649; 95%CI = 1.309 to 5.362). In patients without comorbidities, we observed an association between SNP rs1060826*GG (NOS2) and bronchiolitis caused by rhinovirus (OR = 3.369; 95%CI = 1.435 to 7.908). Fig. 2 and Table 5 show association between polymorphisms and bronchiolitis severity. SNPs rs4986790*AG (TLR4) (OR = 8.025; 95%CI = 1.26 to 51.12) and rs2228570*CC (VDR) (OR = 8.889; 95%CI = 1.312 to 60.21) were associated with progression to death, rs352162*TT (TLR9) (OR = 5.207; 95%CI = 2.118 to 12.8), and rs187084*TC (OR = 0.455; 95%CI = 0.222 to 0.935) (TLR9) with ICU admission, and rs352162*CC + CT (TLR9) (OR = 2.718; 95%CI = 1.103 to 6.695) and rs2107538*TT (CCL5) (OR = 4.974; 95%CI = 1.047 to 23.63) with need for mechanical ventilation. Data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation; medians (range) or frequencies (percentage). A.E. Alvarez et al. Gene 645 (2018) 7-17 In patients without comorbidities, SNP rs1898830 (TLR2) was associated with progression to death because the four patients who died during the study were heterozygous for this SNP (P = 0.036). Additionally, rs1927911*CC (TLR4) (OR = 3.578; 95%CI = 1.238 to 10.34) and rs2107538*TT (CCL5) (OR = 6; 95%CI = 1.221 to 29.48) were associated with need for mechanical ventilation, rs7656411*GT (TLR2) (OR = 2.5; 95%CI = 1.093 to 5.718) with length of oxygen use, and rs352162*TT (TLR9) (OR = 4.886; 95%CI = 1.689 to 14.13) and rs2280788 (CCL5) with ICU admission. The rs2280788 (CCL5) heterozygous genotype was only present in patients who required ICU admission (P = 0.036).",

A TLR deficiency may lead to the absence of Th1 polarizing signals, and change T cell responses from protective Th1 and cytotoxic T cell immunity toward dysregulated Th2 and Th17 polarization, causing bronchiolitis in susceptible infants (Farrag and Almajhdi, 2016; Arruvito et al., 2015) . A recent study demonstrated that the RSV fusion protein was capable of inducing the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which immobilize and kill pathogens, through TLR4 activation.

The stimuli that cause transcriptional activation of iNOS in these cells varied widely and included endogenous mediators (such as chemokines and cytokines) as well as exogenous factors such as bacterial toxins, virus infection, allergens, environmental pollutants, hypoxia, tumors, etc. The high level of NO released by iNOS has an effect as immune effector molecule in halting viral replication, and in eliminating various pathogens.
