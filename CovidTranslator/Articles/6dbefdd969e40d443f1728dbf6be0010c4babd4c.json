            "text": "Influenza viruses contain a segmented, single stranded (-) RNA genome. The genus is divided in three types, A, B, and C, based on specific epitopes on the internal nucleoprotein and the matrix protein. Human influenza A virus strains are further'clas&ied in the subtypes HlNl, H3N2 and the presently not circulating H2N2 subtype, based on the antigenic differences of the hemagglutinin (H) and the neuraminidase (N) surface proteins. Laboratory diagnosis of infections with influenza virus is mainly performed by culturing a respiratory sample, nasopharyngeal aspirates or swabs, for 16 24 h, with, subsequently, an immunofluorescent analysis of the propagated virus or by direct immunofluorescence (Espy et al., 1986; Stokes et al., 1988) . Recently, the polymerase chain reaction '(PCR) has ,b&n used for detection of numerous pathogens and the\"technique appeared to be very sensitive and specific (Wright and Wynford-Thomas, 1990 ). Amplification of influenza RNA genome segments by RNA-PCR has also been carried out. The technique was used for obtaining, rapidly, nucleotide sequence information (Katz et al., 1990; Robertson et al., 1990; Ludwig et al., 1991) and a nested PCR was used for typing and subtyping of cultured influenza strains (Zhang and Evans, 1991) . In addition, some applications to clinical specimens are described. Influenza A hemagglutinin can be amplified from nasopharyngeal lavages (Bressoud et al., 1990) and throat swabs (Yamada et al., 1991) . However, the genome segments coding for the H and N surface glycoproteins show a great variability in their RNA nucleotide sequences and are, therefore, not suitable for the development of a type specific PCR for influenza A. Other segments of the influenza A genome are much more conserved in their nucleotide sequences. In influenza B and C strains the segmented genomes contain conserved segments as well (Air and Laver, 1990; Lamb, 1989) .",

The primers selected for influenza B produced amplified products of 241 bp in an RNA-PCR on RNA of the 11 influenza B strains (Fig. 1) . With the influenza C primers specific 326 bp products are generated with influenza C virus RNA. For an optimal specificity and sensitivity of the PCR, all results were confirmed by southern blot hybridization with an oligonucleotide probe, directed against the internal part of the amplified sequences (Fig. 1) The cross reactivity of the influenza primers was also tested. Fig. 2 shows the results from amplifications with the three-primer sets on RNA from the three different influenza types. As shown, specific signals were obtained only with the homologous type of virus. The oligonucleotide probes used for confirmation of the results in southern blot hybridization were also type-specific. The specificity of the three primer sets was tested further on isolates of a variety of respiratory micro-organisms (Table 2 ). Viral isolates were propagated on cultured cells and bacterial strains were grown on agar plates. Extraction of DNA/RNA from these organisms was by GPC extraction, as described. An aliquot of 5-10 ng of the extracted nucleic acids was subjected to the RNA-PCR. Specific amplification products were not detected.",

Specific amplified products were generated from all isolates. Only three human influenza C isolates were tested but, in ad&ion, three isolates from pigs generated the specific 326 bp amplified products as well, which shows the conservation of the selected sequences.

This does not mean that only one influenza particle was present, which explains the positivity of these non plaque-forming dilutions. Using this type-specific RNA-PCR, additional epidemiological information was not obtained from the detected influenza strain. A further differentiation between the currently circulating 'influenza A subtypes (HlNl and H3N2) can be made by an additional PCR, which discriminates between the HI and H3 subtypes (Yamada et al., 1991) . However, for diagnostic purposes, this is less relevant, as only the pathogen that can be detected in the clinical specimen is of importance and will have implications for therapy.

Negative samples could not be used for a comparison of the sensitivity, as negative samples had not been preserved. In the RNA-PCR, six were found to be positive for influenza A, 13 for influenza B. Two other samples were found negative in the PCR, although they were influenza B positive in the culture/IF assay. However, virus could not be propagated from these samples on MDCK cells or embryonated hen's eggs. Thus, no viable virus nor viral RNA were found in these specimens. After retesting one of the samples with IF, the p,ositivity could not be confirmed. From the other sample no more material was available for retesting. Unfortunately, no serologic data were available from these patients. If the technique is applied properly, sensitivity and specificity are the major advantages of the PCR for diagnostic purposes. A nested PCR (Zhang and Evans, 1991) which greatly increases the risk of cross-contamination of the samples, should therefore, be avoided for diagnostic purposes. An additional advantage may be that a sample may be examined simultaneously for more than one pathogen. For the respiratory tract, PCR assays for other respiratory organisms such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae (Bernet et al., 1989) and Chlamydia sp. (Claas et al., 1991) are already available. Application of the technique for routine laboratory diagnosis will include the replacement of radioactive by non-radioactive detection methods. The RNA-PCR can also be used for detection of influenza genomes directly in tissue. Oseasohn et al. (1959) reported myocarditis in one third of fatal influenza cases, and occasionally the virus was isolated from the myocardium (Engblom et al., 1983) . The etiological role of the virus in myocarditis or other influenza-associated mortalities (Tillet et al., 1983; Sprenger et al., 1990) can be examined with RNA-PCR.",
