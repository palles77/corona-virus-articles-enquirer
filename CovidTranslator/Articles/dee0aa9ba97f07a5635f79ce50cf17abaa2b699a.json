To eradicate TB, the World Health Organization establishes the end TB strategy which outlines an overall goal of 90% reduction in incidence and 95% reduction in mortality, compared with 2015 baseline. [1] Although great achievements have been obtained for TB control, TB still develops into the leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, ranking above human immunodeficiency virus infection (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. [1] Globally, 10 million people (64% new cases) suffer from TB and 1.6 million people die of TB in 2017. [1] It is uncertain if maintaining the current strategies will be enough for human to reach the 2035 target. [2] Since 1990s, China has implemented a high-quality directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS) strategy in Center for Disease Control (CDC) public health clinics in 13 provinces (including Shandong province) covering half the country's population. [3] However, only 30% of the estimated new smear-positive TB cases were treated under this program till 2000. [4] To accelerate the national TB control efforts, several strategies have developed since 2000. The Chinese government expanded the DOTS strategy nationwide with its free treatment policy to also cover active pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in 2000 and smear-negative PTB in 2005 (before 2000, free treatment were provided only for smear-positive patients). [5] Moreover, after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was brought under control, the Chinese government increased publichealth funding, revised laws on TB control, introduced internetbased disease reporting system, and rebuilt local publichealth facilities to accelerate the performance of TB control programs. [6] [7] [8] With those strategies, a 48% reduction in bacteriologically positive TB and a 65% reduction in smearpositive TB were achieved between 1990 and 2010, dramatically contributing to the realization of the stop TB strategy. [4, 5, 9, 10] However, China still ranks second among the 30 high TB-burden countries and has the world's largest number of patients with multidrug-resistant. [1] TB remains an ongoing intractable health challenge in China.",

Only 2.48% patients aged <18 years. Nearly all patients (99.62%) were Han, 70.82% were male and 93.23% were rural residents. Among all PTB patients, 116 744 (52.01%) were smear-positive PTB, whereas 107,736 (47.99%) were smear-negative PTB. The proportion of patients with TB contact history was 13.13%. A total of 205,716 (91.64%) cases were new cases and 18,764 (8.36%) were relapsed cases. In new cases, the proportions of smear-positive PTB and smear-negative PTB were nearly half and half (48.04% vs 51.96%). While the corresponding proportions were 95.45% and 4.55% in relapse cases (Table 1) . Figure 1 illustrates the distribution of averaged PTB incidence in 6 cities of Shandong, China 2005 to 2017. The averaged PTB incidence of the highest TB burden city (Linyi, 49.07 per 100,000) was 1.64 times of the incidence of the lowest TB burden city (Weifang, 29.90 per 100,000). (Tables 2 and 3 ). The incidence stratified by sex, age, and geographical location also declined during the 13-year period. These changes in incidence stratified by sex were similar with that in overall PTB which were increased during 2005 to 2008 (P < .05) and decreased during 2008 to 2017 (P < .05). The highest incidence rate grouping by age was 92.81 per 100,000 among patients aged >60 years in 2005. The incidence in this age group of patients decreased in the following years reaching 45.84 per 100,000 in 2017. The largest decline in incidence grouping by geographical location occurred in Dezhou, dropped by 60.08% from 49.78 to 19 .87 per 100,000. The smallest decline in incidence grouping by geographical location occurred in Weifang, dropped by 12.17% from 28.9 to 25.39 per 100,000 (Tables 2 and 3 ).",

[27] Previous study demonstrated that chronic comorbidities, malignancy, malnutrition, excess alcohol use, and the waning immunity predisposes the ageing patient to infections disease such as TB. [28] In patients aged \u226560 years, about 90% of TB cases are due to reactivation of primary infection. [29] What worse, people in this population group is expected to rise to about 22% by 2050. [30] In our study, patients aged >60 years accounted for 30.51% of all PTB patients, the highest incidence rate grouping by age was 92.81 per 100,000 among this age group in 2005. The DOTS strategy, which does not specifically address reactivation disease in the short term seems to be limited. One study of TB transmission through an individual-based computational model reported that maintenance of the DOTS strategy only will hardly achieve the 2035 targets. While along with other feasible interventions and preventative therapy for elders would enable China to nearly reach both the 2035 incidence and mortality goal. [27] As elderly TB patients are less likely to be smear positive, more likely to default/die, and more common to have adverse events to anti-TB drugs, [31] appropriate interventions are urgently needed for effective management of TB in this vulnerable population. Forth, regional disparities are one of the challenges facing TB control in China. The China's Fifth National TB Epidemiological Survey in 2010 elucidated that the prevalence of bacteriologically confirmed PTB in the western region (212 per 100,000) was 1.7 times of that in the central region (124 per 100,000) , and 3.2 times of that in the eastern region (66 per 100,000). Consistent with previous research, our study demonstrates a regional disparity of PTB within Shandong province. [32] Medical factors, income, education, geography, environment, customs, and so on were associated with TB prevalence. [28] Regional equity both within and across province is essential for future TB control.",

First, as a retrospective study, few information on incomes, expenditure, complications, living conditions, and the specific diagnostic methods for every smearnegative PTB were provided by the medical records. Second, all information was obtained from Information System for Disease Control and Prevention, in which primary information may have detection bias under different discretion of the treating physician and be vague and was re-evaluated by trained research coordinators. Last, because only 1 province on the eastern coast of China was examined, the economic and regional disparities limited the generalizability of the results. [28] In conclusion, the incidence of PTB in Shandong Province, China, decreased over the study periods. With persistent efforts to combat TB, the burden of TB has shifted. While further reducing the level of smear-positive PTB and relapse cases may have a modest effect on TB control, additional efforts in reducing the incidence of smear-negative PTB and elderly patients may have a greater impact on future TB control.",
