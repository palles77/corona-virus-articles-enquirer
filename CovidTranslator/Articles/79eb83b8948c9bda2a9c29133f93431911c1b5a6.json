In the case of the immunoglobulin receptor on B cells, both the antigenic site on the protein antigen and the binding site of the immunoglobulin are topographic surfaces. However, in the case of the T cell receptor (TCR), the antigenic region of the protein is a peptide derived by cellular processing and expressed on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell associated with a molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The cellular compartment in which the T cell epitope is generated determines whether it emerges at the cell surface bound to MHC class I or II molecules and, therefore, what type of T cell response is elicited. There have been enormous advances made in the last few years in our understanding of the molecular and cellular machinery that governs the presentation of antigens to the immune system. In our laboratory, we are attempting to apply this knowledge to the development of strategies of immune regulation for a number of disease models. Our work serves two purposes. The first is that we believe that we can learn much about the mechanisms of immunity by testing the outcome of applying current theories to manipulating immunopathological states. The second is to heed Albert Sabin's maxim \"To yield to every whim of curiosity, and to allow our passion for inquiry to be restrained by nothing but the limits of our ability shows an eagerness of mind not unbecoming to scholarship. But it is wisdom that has the merit of selecting from among the innumerable problems which present themselves, those whose solution is important to mankind\" (1) .",

We have shown that recombinant forms of this organism, which have been transformed to express foreign antigens, are excellent vectors for targeting foreign antigens to the MHC class I pathway of antigen processing with the generation of authentic cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes. In the area of autoimmunity, we are attempting to down regulate T cell responses by specific immune intervention directed against autoreactive T cells. In these studies, we use two murine models for multiple sclerosis. The first is the experimentally induced autoimmune disease known as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE).

The unusual property of L. monocytogenes to live in the cytoplasm of host cells (see Fig. 1 ) sequesters the bacterium from the humoral immune response and requires a strong cell-mediated immune response to resolve infection (3) . It has been shown that L. monocytogenes enters the host cell and is taken up in a phagosome but, unlike most other intracellular bacteria (4), L. monocytogenes escapes from the phagosome into the cytoplasm of the cell by disrupting the phagosomal mem- Fig. 1 . How antigens secreted by L. monocytogenes access both the MHC class I and class II pathways for antigen processing. (A) After phagocytosis into an antigen presenting cell, L. monocytogenes is either (B) destroyed within a lysosomal compartment, where peptides may be loaded onto MHC class II molecules, or (C) it escapes into the cytoplasm of the cell. In the cytosolic compartment, Listeria can grow and any protein it secretes can be processed by proteosomes into peptides that will be transported (D) to the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules. (E) In the cytosolic compartment, List~eria reorganizes the host cells actin into \"tails,\" which propel it around the cell and to the cell's periphery. There it can be internalized by a neighboring cell, and by breaking through, two plasma membranes colonize this cell. Reprinted with permission from Current Biology Ltd., London, UK from Curr. Opin.

The bacteria replicate in the cytoplasm, and then move to the periphery of the cell where they form pseudopod-like structures, which are recognized and internalized by adjacent cells where the cycle is repeated (5) . The unusual ability of L. monocytogenes to escape phagolysosomal restriction and live in the cytoplasm explains why this bacterium is particularly effective as a vector for targeting the class I-restricted pathway of antigen processing. The localization of bacteria in the lysosomal compartment after invasion ensure that antigens expressed by this bacterium enter the MHC class II pathway for antigen processing, since the majority of bacteria are killed and digested in this compartment in vivo (6) . Finally, the ability of the bacterium to spread from cell to cell without entering the extracellular matrix explains its inadequacy in inducing an antibody response. Early studies showed that CD8 + T cells are the major effector subset in controlling and clearing the listerial murine infection (7, 8) . Hemolytic activity of the bacteria is required for T cell induction in vivo and presentation to CD8 + T cells in vitro (9, 10) . The role ofCD4 + T cells appears to be less critical for the control of L. monocytogenes infections in the murine model. Depletion of CD4 + lymphocytes during adoptive transfer has a much less pronounced effect than depletion of CD8 + lymphocytes (7) . Depletion ofCD4 + cells during primary L. monocytogenes infection or in L. monocytogenes immune mice had only a marginal effect in controlling L. monocytogenes challenge, although delayed-type hypersensitivity and granuloma formation were severely diminished in mice treated with anti-CD4 antibody (8) . The strong DTH response to L. monocytogenes can now be directly related to the innate immune response to this bacterium that takes place early in infection (11) . Phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes by a resident macrophage results in the secretion of interleukin (IL) I, ILl2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)c~ and its activation to a state that is competent to destroy the invading parasite by nitric oxide (NO) production. ILl secreted by resident macrophages activates neutrophils and helps to maintain the activated state of macrophages, which have increased MHC expression. ILl2 and TNF act on NK cells stimulating them to secrete interferon (IFN) 7. This facilitates the expansion of Th0 cells, which under the influence of ILl2 and IFN 7 differentiate to the Th 1 phenotype that secretes IL2, TNFc~, and IFN 7. Later in infection, ILl0 may be secreted by macrophages that can downregulate the activation of Th0 to Thl. These stages in innate immunity are consistent with the ability of L. monocytogenes to promote cell-mediated over humoral immunity and verify that the in vivo CD4 + T cell response is also restricted to a Thl phenotype, as is the case with other intracellular pathogens (12) .",

            "text": "In the present decade, there has been an emerging consensus that T cells, and especially class I-restricted CD8 + T cells, are the critical mediators of an effective antitumor response (13) . Unlike antibody targets, T cell epitopes may be cytoplasmically located, and their epitopes consist of linear amino acid stretches. In the last few years, a number of tumor antigens as well as epitopes recognized by tumor-specific T cells have been characterized (13) . Consequently, current cancer vaccination strategies are primarily directed toward raising strong tumor-specific T cell responses and introducing these identified T cell antigens to the immune system in such a way as to prime an immune response that will be sufficient to eliminate tumor metastases and residual tumor mass (14, 15) . A serious problem, however, in mounting an immune response to antigens expressed by tumor cells is that they are often 194 Paterson poorly immunogenic because of their strong homology to self-proteins. In addition, they will have been initially presented to the immune system in the context of tumor cells that are, for the most part, poor antigen-presenting cells likely to induce tolerance to the antigen rather than an active T cell response. The ability of L. monocytogenes to stimulate strong cell-mediated immunity suggests that this bacterium may be an ideal vaccine vector to introduce poorly immunogenic tumor-specific antigens to the MHC class I and class II antigen presentation pathways in professional antigen-presenting cells. To test the efficacy of L. monocytogenes as a cancer vaccine, we have used a model tumor system that utilized influenza nucleoprotein as a model tumor antigen (16, ! 7) . A recombinant L. monocytogenes vaccine strain (Lm-NP) that expresses NP from influenza strain A/PR8/34 was used. Lm-NP had previously been shown to present the K d restricted NP epitope in vitro and induce NP-specific CTL in vivo (18) . To provide transplantable tumors expressing NP as a model tumor antigen, the highly tumorigenic, class P/IF tumor cells CT26 and RENCA were transduced with the NP gene. We found that the therapeutic potential of this vaccine vector to limit tumor growth (16) was impressive. Regression of macroscopic tumors could be demonstrated for both tumor types (16, 17) . The importance ofT cells in the antitumor immunity was confirmed by histological analysis of the tumors and by in vivo depletion of either the CD8 + or CD4 + T cell subset. Both subsets clearly played a role in antitumor immunity despite the fact that both tumors are MHC class I+/II -, and class II expression on CT26 is not inducible. Thus, CD8 \u00a7 cells might well have been expected to be the sole effector mechanism operating in the tumor environment. Nevertheless, a consideration of the multifaceted way in which L. monocytogenes stimulates immunity may provide an explanation for these findings.",

This deficiency has been remedied by transfecting the tumor cells with certain cytokine genes, such as IFN 7, IL2, IL3, IL4, IL6, IL7, GM-CSF (13, 14, (19) (20) (21) or with costimulatory ligands (12, 22, 23) which either activate or bypass the requirement for T cell help in mounting a protective tumor-specific CD8 \u00a7 CTL response. Accordingly, the Thl type cytokine profile induced by L. monocytogenes that we have described may play an important role in the efficacy of this vaccine vector. Indeed, we have demonstrated the presence of mRNA from a wide array of Th 1type cytokines in regressing tumors explanted from vaccinated animals and shown that depletion of the Thl-type cytokines ILl2, IFNy, and TNFc~ can abrogate the ability of L. monocytogenes to protect against tumor challenge in the NP model system (Pan et al., unpublished observations). The induction by Thl cytokines of cell-surface molecules important in T celt activation is a considerable advantage in an anticancer vaccine. Thus, L. monocytogenes may be an ideal vehicle not only for presentation of tumor antigens to tumor-specific T cells, but also to provide the correct milieu to enhance the efficacy of these effector cells.",

We are also expanding our studies to more natural models of mouse and human tumors. It could be argued that influenza nucleoprotein is too immunogenic to be an appropriate model tumor antigen. In fact, the expression of NP in Renca and CT26 does not appear to enhance their immunogenicity or decrease their intrinsic tumorogenicity, and the minimal tumoricidal doses for Renca-NP and CT26-NP in BALB/c mice are identical to the parent lines (5 \u2022 103/mouse).

One of the most devastating of these is HIV. There is increasing evidence that retroviruses can induce both humoral and cellular immunity. Indeed, it is now several years since HIV-specific CTL were discovered in healthy seropositive patients (30) (31) (32) , and since then there have been many studies which have confirmed the presence of CTL in HIV + humans specific for gag, pol, nef tat, and env gene products (33, 34) . The role ofCD8 + CTL in the immune clearance of retroviruses is still not entirely clear, but there are a number of studies suggesting that CTL may play a major role in protection against HIV and its simian counterpart.

In addition, antibodies against the major envelope protein gpl20 have been shown not only to be ineffective in protecting against viral infection, but also to be implicated in disease progression (38) . 196 Paterson A low rate of mutation in the genes that code for core proteins is a major advantage in vaccines aimed at enhancing the cellular arm of the immune response to viruses, such as influenza and HIV, which have mechanisms for avoiding humoral immune responses. In contrast to antibodies, CTL are often broadly crossreactive, because they are easily invoked by core proteins, which readily target the class-I restricted pathway of antigen recognition. The prospects for similar vaccines, aimed at boosting the CD8 + CTL response to HIV, are encouraging since a number of studies have shown that the CTL response to gag (39) (40) (41) (42) , nef (39, (43) (44) , and pol (45, 46) gene products are restricted to conserved sequences in these proteins from HIV-1 presented by a wide number of HLA class I alleles. Therefore, despite some reservations, there is good evidence that the CD8 + class I-restricted arm of the cellular immune response may play a helpful role in reducing HIV disease progression in infected individuals, in addition to having a pivotal role in the design of a prophylactic anti-HIV vaccine.",

Although still very controversial, it has been suggested that the humoral immune response, far from being beneficial or even ineffective in HIV infection, may actually be harmful, because it impairs the ability of the host to mount a protective cellular immune response (47~19). This thesis is supported by other disease models. Thus, it has long been known (50) that either the humoral or cell-mediated arm predominates in the immune response to infectious agents, particularly intracellular pathogens, such as Leishmania major and Mycobacterium leprae (12) , resulting in either resistance or susceptibility to the disease. In support of the suggestion that this may also be the case for HIV infections are studies on HIV + individuals that indicated that there is a decline in T cell proliferation and IL2 production with a concomitant increase in B cell activity as AIDS symptoms progress (49, 51, 52) .",

Although strong CD8 + and CD4 + T cell responses are to be predicted, it is not obvious that the weak humoral responses detected when Listeria is delivered by a parenteral route would also prevail in the gut. It is currently thought that the mucosal immune response to soluble antigen is predisposed to a Th2 response, presumably because of the requirement for Th2 cytokines in the secreted IgA response. Thus, it is of interest to determine if the same would be true of antigens delivered by an intracellular pathogen capable of inducing cytokines that drive the T cell response in the other direction. Given that L. monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular bacterium, it is very possible that the bacterium is extracellular in this particular environment and competent, therefore, to induce an IgA response secreted by Peyer' s patch B cells and intestinal epithelial lymphocytes. It is particularly important to establish this if this bacterium is ever to be used as an oral recombinant vaccine vector for either neoplastic or infectious disease. However, a problem arises in distinguishing between specific IgA produced in response to iisterial antigens and IgA that is naturally occurring in the gut owing to responses to commensal bacteria. Nevertheless, by using L. monocytogenes, which expresses foreign antigens that are chemically distinct from prokaryotic proteins, we can use these as reporter antigens to quantitate immune responses against protein secreted by Listeria.",

In the mouse model, there is growing evidence that CD8 + T cells are the major regulatory cell for EAE, and such cells have been strongly implicated in TCR peptide-induced unresponsiveness (67) . For example, mice depleted of CD8 + cells by antibody-mediated clearance (68) or by \"knockout\" of the CD8 gene (69) showed less resistance to relapsing episodes of the disease. In addition, although TCR peptide-specific CD4 + T cells have been isolated from mice recovering from MBPinduced EAE, they are thought to regulate the disease indirectly via a CD8 + T cell mediator (70) . Given that mouse T cells, unlike their rat counterparts, do not express class II MHC, it appears unlikely that encephalitogenic CD4 + T cells could be the cognate target of CD4 +regulatory T cells in the mouse model. Our studies, therefore, concentrate on determining the presence of CDS+-regulatory T cells against MBP-reactive T cells in the peripheral mouse repertoire, and what role they may have in regulation of EAE or in maintenance of tolerance in general in the mouse. In addition to providing a basis for possible autoimmune therapy, we believe our studies also address the whole issue of immune regulation and/or suppression in active cellular immune responses.",

The reduction in responsiveness was very similar to the effects we see with MBP in the H-2u mice immunized with VV138.2 (Eidelman, et al., unpublished observations). Then T cells from the AD10 TCR transgenic H-2 k mouse were adoptively transferred into syngeneic mice that had received VacV[33, VacVI38.2, or no vaccine, and the animals were subsequently immunized with pcyt c. The V~33+Vcd 1 + (AD10) pCyt c-responsive T cells were significantly reduced in the VacV~33immunized animals compared to the control group as determined by FACS analysis of draining lymph nodes. However, the VJ33+V~l 1population, which would not be activated by pCyt c, remained at similar levels. This indicates that immunization by VV[33 appears to be influencing activated T cells only.

Using limiting dilution analysis we found that the potent primary proliferative responses by Tcells from H-2 s mice reflect a high frequency (0.26-0.45%) of heme-responsive T cells in the periphery (78) . This frequency is comparable to the frequency of alloresponsive T cells reported by others in primary mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR). In keeping with their low responder phenotype in bulk primary assays heme-responsive T cells occur at about a 10-fold lower frequency in unprimed H-2 d mice (0.03%). Notably, even this figure is high by comparison to the frequency of T cells responding to a foreign protein antigen, horseshoe crab hemocyanin. Only 0.02% ofT cells from SJL mice respond to HCHy even after expansion of this population by in vivo priming. In this respect, the response to heine differs not only from other self antigens for which T cell responses in healthy animals are generally detected only after considerable manipulation, but also from foreign proteins after in vivo expansion. We also have shown that T cells reactive to heine are similar to T cells reactive to peptide antigens in that they show strict MHC restriction and can use diverse V genes (78) . These features distinguish heme from superantigens and mitogens, which also stimulate potent primary MLR, but exhibit degenerate MHC restriction and, in the case of superantigens, restricted V gene usage. Using mass spectral analysis of naturally processed peptides bound to MHC class II molecules, we demonstrated that the set ofpeptides from cells pulsed with heme were quite different from those isolated from cells grown in the absence of heme. This suggests that T cells may be stimulated by heme via an alloreactive-like mechanism (79) . Currently, we are using a phage display library approach to determine if heme mediates this effect by binding to a set of peptides previously not presented to the immune system and facilitating their interaction with MHC class H.",

Thus, mammalian cytochromes-c were ineffective, but avian cytochromes were as potent as free heme. The poor antigenicity of mammalian proteins, however, could be reversed by denaturing the protein, suggesting that the native molecule is resistant to processing by murine antigen-presenting cells. Thus, heme appears to evade immune recognition in mice by sequestration as a cryptic epitope in some hemoproteins (80) .

Although the immune-mediated damage can often be traced to autoimmune T cells, it appears that viral infections can trigger these responses either by inducing inflammatory Th 1-type cytokines that break tolerance to the auto-antigen or by a molecular mimicry mechanism, whereby a T cell response to a viral peptide sequence cross reacts with a homologous self-antigen (81) . Where viral infections are implicated in the initiation of autoimmune disease, this can obscure the exact etiology of the disease. This is the case with the human demyelinating disease MS. Although decades of research on the pathological, immunological, and biochemical aspects of the disease have taken place, the etiology and pathogenesis of MS are still unclear. MS is an inflammatory, demyelinating disease in which the CNS lesions are heavily infiltrated by lymphocytes and macrophages. Inflammation of the CNS and the presence of increased MHC expression on resident cells in plaque areas (82) (83) (84) suggest autoimmune-mediated damage to the CNS. Epidemiological evidence, however, suggests there may be a viral infection involved in the etiology of MS (85) , and many attempts have been made to identify and/or isolate viruses from the CNS and blood of MS patients. However, despite reported successes over the years, in no case has a virus been unequivocally established as a causative agent of MS. It is quite possible, therefore, that the disease is fundamentally autoimmune in origin, but that a viral infection may trigger the response.",

In contrast to these studies, we have recently shown that CD8 + T cell deficient ~2M -/-gene knockout mice undergo demyelination, indicating that CD8 + T cells are not absolutely necessary for demyelination (90) . However, the frequency at which demyelination was observed in these animals was very low, a result which may be attributed to either a role for CD8 + T cells in demyelination in normal mice, or an inefficient infection rate owing to the use of a low inoculating dose of wild-type MHV-A59 in ~2M -/-knockout mice (LDs0 = 5 PFU). Although infection could reliably be established using C 12, an attenuated variant of A59 (LDs0 = 200 PFU in knockout mice), the question of the relative importance ofCD8 + T cells in demyelinating disease remained in some doubt, since C12 induces demyelinating lesions at very low frequency in both wildtype and ~2M -/-knockout mice.",

Similarly, we have extended our earlier study by addressing the role of CD4 \u00a7 T cells. We examined the effect ofCD4 + or CD8 + T cell depletion at various time-points postinfection on the incidence of demyelination. An attempt was made to examine the role of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in demyelination in the early stages of infection by MHV-A59 by commencing the depletion of each of these subsets on 5 dpi. Unfortunately, of six mice in each group infected in this experiment, all those depleted ofCD8 + cells and four depleted of CD4 + cells died 15 dpi. This result was unsurprising given that viral titers are at a peak at 5 dpi and both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are 202 Paterson known to be important in MHV clearance (92, 93) . In order to reduce the risk of fatalities, this experiment was repeated, but the commencement of T cell depletions was delayed until 7 dpi, when viral titers were beginning to decline in thymectomized mice. Spinal cords were collected at 30 dpi and examined by toluidine blue staining for demyelinating lesions as described above. All mice examined in both control and CD4 + or CD8 + T cell-depleted groups contained demyelinating lesions. We also performed the experiment beginning depletion oft cells at day 10 when viral titers are waning. This enabled us to also examine the effects of depleting both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells subsets, together, in addition to CD4 + and CD8 + T cells separately, without risk of persistent viral infection. Again, we saw no significant difference between any of the groups of mice with regard to demyelination at 30 dpi, compared to the control group, including the five mice in which both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were depleted. These results suggest that neither CD4 + nor CD8 + T cells are the major effectots of MHV-induced demyelinating disease, but do not exclude a minor role of these T cells as effectors of demyelination.",

            "text": "Given our results, and those of Stohlman and colleagues (88, 89) , which show that demyelination is reduced only if mice are immunosuppressed by irradiation at 6 dpi or earlier, with restoration of demyelination on adoptive transfer of Thyl + splenocytes, it seems probable that T cells may play a role in induction of demyelinating disease rather than as major effectors. It is possible that a component of early demyelination, prior to clearance of infectious virus, may be owing to direct virus-mediated lysis of oligodendrocytes. However, this seems unlikely to be responsible for the majority of the demyelination, which arises when infectious virus is no longer detected. The failure to suppress demyelina-tion via irradiation at 7 dpi or later (89) would be consistent with a role for more radiationresistant effectors, such as macrophages dependent on activation via T cells in the initial stages of the disease. In this regard, although CD4 + T cells play a critical role in demyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and an as yet undefined role in MS (94) , macrophages are also conspicuous in the inflammatory lesions of these demyelinating diseases (95, 96) . We are currently pursuing the source of CNS inflammation in MHV-A59-infected animals by examining the expression of cytokines in the CNS at various times of infection and postinfection during the demyelinating phase.",

These include the antigen-processing pathway accessible to the antigen, the level of costimulatory ligands on the antigenpresenting cell, the cytokine milieu in which the immune response develops, and the possible induction ofimmuno-regulatory cells. In this brief article, we have outlined some of the studies in these areas that engage and excite our laboratory. Our current approach is to use live recombinant vectors to manipulate these parameters. However, given that these organisms are precisely the stimuli to which the immune system has evolved, we believe that studying the immune response to the reporter antigens they express will shed light on fundamental immune mechanisms.",
