The proteasome is also involved in cellular degradation, but autophagy refers only to those pathways that lead to the elimination of cytoplasmic components by delivering them into mammalian lysosomes or plant and yeast vacuoles. Autophagy is often labelled as degradative, but it is more accurate to describe it as a recycling pathway to highlight its important contribution to cell physiology. Metabolites generated in the lysosomes or vacuoles as a result of autophagy are reused either as sources of energy or building blocks for the synthesis of new macromolecules. So far, three major types of autophagy have been described: macroautophagy, microautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) (Fig. 1) . This Review will focus on macroautophagy, hereafter referred to as autophagy.",

From here, they participate (probably together with specific SNAREs and tethering factors) in the orchestrated fusion of Golgi-, endosome-and plasma-membrane-derived membranes to form the phagophore 3 . The PAS has been shown to emerge from regions of the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum enriched in the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P)-binding protein DFCP1, which have been named omegasomes 4 . The visualization of contact points between omegasomes and phagophores have led to the hypothesis that lipids are supplied to the nascent autophagosomes by direct transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum 5, 6 , but other lipid sources, such as mitochondria, have also been implicated in this process 7 .

The recruitment of this cargo into autophagosomes depends on Atg11 and the autophagy receptor Atg19 (Atg11 and Atg19 are not required for starvation-induced autophagy). The distribution of Atg19 on the surface of the cargo and its interaction with Atg8 through an LIR motif allow the hermetic formation of a double-membrane vesicle around the targeted structure. Atg32 and Atg36 are yeast autophagy receptors for mitochondria and peroxisomes, respectively; they are found on the surface of these organelles and seem to operate in the same way as Atg19 (refs 16-18) .",

Several signalling molecules and cascades modulate autophagy in response to numerous cellular and environmental cues 25, 26 . The best-characterized regulator of autophagy is mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1). This kinase negatively regulates autophagy by inhibiting the activity of the Atg1 (ULK1) complex through direct phosphorylation. The activity of mTORC1 is stimulated by a variety of anabolic inputs, which include the energy and nutrient status of the cell as well as the presence of amino acids and growth factors. Conversely, mTORC1 is inhibited when amino acids are scarce, growth factor signalling is reduced and/or ATP concentrations fall, and this results in a de-repression of autophagy 26 . The mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of the Atg1 (ULK1) complex and the ubiquitination-like reactions are central during autophagosome biogenesis through the generation of the Atg12-Atg5 and the Atg8phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) conjugates. Although these were initially considered to be the only post-translational modifications in autophagy, proteins linked to the Atg machinery are now known to be substrates for a wide range of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination and acetylation 27 .",

Thus, ULK1 is activated by either phosphorylation or acetylation in response to amino acid (or glucose) and growth factor deprivation, respectively 44 .",

The Atg machinery has now been shown to participate in the release of cargoes into the extracellular medium, shedding light on the mechanism of a few types of unconventional protein secretion [45] [46] [47] . This mechanism seems to be involved in the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 in mammalian cells 47 . This process depends on Atg5, the inflammasome, the peripheral Golgi protein GRASP55 and the small GTPase Rab8a. This autophagy-based unconventional secretion mechanism can probably be extended to modulators of the immune response such as HMGB1 (ref. 47) . The morphology of the autophagy-related organelles involved in secretion and the molecular basis for their formation, however, remain to be identified. In yeast, the putative carriers for this type of secretion were suggested to come from a hitherto-unknown compartment for unconventional protein secretion (aptly named CUPS) 48 . Like the PAS, CUPS also contains PtdIns3P as well as Atg8 and Atg9. However, although these two Atg proteins are required for the generation of the PAS, they seem to be unnecessary for CUPS formation. In mammalian systems, this mode of secretion could explain the non-lytic release of viruses that subverts the autophagy machinery for egression 49 or the expulsion of cellular material by autophagosomes at the late stages of reticulocyte maturation into erythrocytes 50 .",

Importantly, mTOR located at the lysosomal surface is activated by amino acid efflux from lysosomes and positively regulates protein synthesis and cell growth 52 . Interactions between TASCC, lysosomes and autophagosomes could be key in coordinating cell metabolism by coupling autophagic degradation with both the synthesis and secretion of proteins. TASCClike structures have also been observed in non-senescent cells, suggesting that this mechanism for protein secretion may be widely used 51 .",

            "text": "The role of autophagy in cancer metabolism has been the subject of intense investigation. Autophagy protects cancer cells from metabolic stress (such as decreased nutrient availability and hypoxic conditions) by reducing oxidative stress and maintaining genomic stability 64 . It is now clear that cancer cells reprogram their metabolism to support their rapid proliferation and growth. To increase their nutrient uptake, cancer cells also perform aerobic glycolysis to oxidize glucose into lactate to produce ATP and intermediary metabolites used for anabolic reactions that sustain cell growth 65 . This metabolic switch includes the expression of specific isoforms of glycolytic enzymes, as well as expression of enzymes metabolizing amino acids and lipids, with distinct enzymatic activities and substrate preferences 66 . In this context, the activation of the hypoxia-responsive factor HIF-1 regulates the expression of many glycolytic enzymes and also induces mitophagy 67 . A recent metabolomic study has demonstrated that cells can maintain minimal levels of mitochondrial respiration to produce ATP under hypoxia (1% oxygen), and these cells also display increased levels of autophagy activity and intermediates resulting from protein and lipid catabolism 68 . Autophagy inhibition under these conditions reduces intracellular ATP levels and induces cell death, indicating that the degradation products resulting from autophagy are able to fuel the tricarboxylic acid cycle for ATP synthesis to maintain cell viability even under low oxygen conditions 68 . This cyto-protective role of autophagy under hypoxic conditions may be modulated through microRNA-dependent regulation of ATG7 expression in hepatic tumour cell lines and in vivo xenographs 69 . It is still unknown whether the autophagy-dependent degradation of mitochondria is an additional mechanism responsible for metabolic reprogramming, although observations in non-tumorigenic cells would support this notion 70 . Indeed, overexpression of the RCAN1-1L protein induces mitophagy and a shift from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism in neuronal cells 70 .",

Tumours are composed of several cell types, and it has been postulated that metabolic coupling is essential for tumour development. In particular, fibroblasts perform aerobic glycolysis inside tumours and display an increased expression of glycolytic enzymes, elevated HIF-1 activity, autophagy and mitophagy 71 . Metabolites resulting from elevated autophagy and glycolysis in these fibroblasts, such as lactate, ketone bodies and amino acids, are released into the tumour microenvironment and sequestered by cancer cells to fuel the oxidative phosphorylation necessary to sustain tumour growth 71 . The autophagy stimulation in fibroblasts also results in increased senescence, which boosts both the production of ketone bodies and mitochondrial metabolism in adjacent cancer cells to promote metastasis 72 . In contrast to these positive effects of autophagy on tumour growth, autophagy upregulation in the cancer cells themselves actually inhibit tumour growth 72 .

ATG12 is a positive mediator of mitochondrial apoptosis by inactivating members of the pro-survival Table 2 Detailed list of the ATG genes that have been implicated in non-autophagic pathways Bcl-2 protein family. The activity of ATG12 is independent of ATG5 or ATG3, and requires a BH3-like motif in ATG12 (ref. 83) . ATG proteins also act in an autophagy-independent manner following proteolytic processing. For example, ATG5 cleavage by calpains generates a pro-apoptotic fragment that interferes with the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL (ref. 84) . Moreover, beclin 1 processing by caspase 3 generates two fragments that do not have the capacity to induce autophagy 85, 86 . The C-terminal fragment resulting from this processing localizes to mitochondria and sensitizes cells to apoptosis 86 . Thus, similarly to proteins involved in apoptosis that also function beyond apoptosis 87 , ATG components, as well as other proteins involved in autophagy such as AMBRA1, VPS34 and p62 (for which autophagy-independent roles are not discussed here), are engaged in non-autophagic functions.

The coordination of Atg protein recruitment to the PAS from different membrane origins, as well as their hierarchical assembly at this specialized site, are aspects of the autophagosome biogenesis that should be carefully considered in the future. Although a hierarchical recruitment of the Atg proteins has been proposed for yeast on a genetic basis 89 , their temporal association and the functional consequences of the hierarchy remain to be investigated. Examination of the selective sequestration of mitochondria or Salmonella by autophagosomes has indicated a different hierarchy than the one postulated, according to which groups or clusters of Atg proteins could independently associate to form the PAS (refs 90,91) .

Complete autophagosomes first fuse with endosomes before finally exposing their content to the hydrolytic interior of lysosomes. The resulting metabolites are transported into the cytoplasm and used either for the synthesis of new macromolecules or as a source of energy. (b) During chaperone-mediated autophagy, proteins carrying the pentapeptide KFERQ-like sequence are recognized by the Hsc70 chaperone, which then associates with the integral lysosome membrane protein LAMP-2A, triggering its oligomerization. This event leads the translocation of the bound protein into the lysosome interior through a process that requires Hsc70.
