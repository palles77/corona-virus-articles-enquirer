Outbreaks can occur in kenneled dog populations and result in significant levels of morbidity and mortality. This highly contagious disease is characterized by the sudden onset of clinical signs, including pyrexia, dyspnea, and hemorrhagic nasal discharge. The pathogenesis of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus infection in dogs is poorly understood. This study systematically characterized the histopathological changes in the lungs of 39 dogs from a large rehoming shelter in London, United Kingdom; the dogs were infected with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. An objective scoring system demonstrated that S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus caused pneumonia in 26/39 (66.7%) dogs, and most of these dogs (17/26 [65.4%]) were classified as severe fibrinosuppurative, necrotizing, and hemorrhagic. Three recently described superantigen genes (szeF, szeN, and szeP) were detected by PCR in 17/47 (36.2%) of the S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus isolates; however, there was no association between the presence of these genes and the histopathological score.

CIRD has a multifactorial etiology and is most prevalent in shelters where stress, due to overcrowding, results in animals becoming more susceptible to infection (8) . The disease is often highly contagious with high morbidity but is rarely fatal, and recovery from mild clinical signs usually occurs within a few weeks (8) .

For one isolate that was PCR positive for all three genes (isolate SzBHS7), sequences were amplified using external primer pairs, cloned into a plasmid vector, and sequenced. The sequences were compared to that of isolate SzBHS5; DNA and amino acid sequence identity were 100% for SzeF, SzeN, and SzeP (23a).",

The majority of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus-infected dogs with pneumonia had severe fibrino-suppurative, necrotizing, and hemorrhagic pneumonia, which is strongly associated with severe clinical signs. A small number of dogs (group 1) had no clinical signs of respiratory disease despite isolation of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus from a postmortem lung wash. It is possible that these dogs were either carriers of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, perhaps they had previously been infected and recovered, or bacterial and/or host factors contributed to the dogs not developing clinical disease.",

Moreover, histopathological lung lesions typical for infection with canine herpesvirus (CHV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine adenovirus (CAV), and canine distemper virus (CDV) were absent. Several of these other agents, in particular canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), are associated with upper respiratory tract infections, and thus, their involvement in pneumonia would not be expected. Interestingly, dogs coinfected with B. bronchiseptica had a significantly lower histopathological score (P \u03ed 0.04) than dogs not coinfected with B. bronchiseptica. This should be interpreted with caution because of the borderline significance of the association; however, this is supportive of B. bronchiseptica having a tropism for the canine upper respiratory tract. In addition, the presence of two different bacteria competing within the same organ system could reduce the overall lung load of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus. An interesting potential implication of this result is that the widespread use of kennel (28) . However, in this study, there was no association between the presence of this bacterium and the histopathological score. Three superantigen genes, szeF, szeN, and szeP, the products of which have 59%, 34%, and 49% amino acid sequence iden-tity to SpeH, SpeL, and SpeM of S. pyogenes, respectively, were previously identified in the genome of isolate SzBHS5 (23a). In order to try to explain differences in both the clinical signs and lung pathology of dogs known to be infected with S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, isolates obtained from postmortem lung washes were screened for the presence of these genes by PCR. Thirtysix percent of isolates in this study were positive, and the identity of the amplified products of one strain was confirmed by sequencing. The remaining 64% of isolates were negative for all three genes, and there was no association between the presence or absence of these genes and clinical respiratory or histopathological scores. This suggests that either these proteins do not have superantigen activity in vivo or that other, as yet unidentified, virulence factors may be associated with severe S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus-associated disease in dogs.",

Studies in humans have shown a direct correlation between serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-\u2423 and IL-6 and the severity of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) (22) . It has recently been shown that plasma levels of IL-6 in dogs are predictive for the severity of sepsis and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (26) . The role of these cytokines in severe pneumonia is also documented for other bacteria and in other species, particularly in pigs with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (1, 27) . Host inflammatory factors are involved in lung lesion development in porcine Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infection, where TNF-\u2423 together with IL-1 stimulates the synthesis and rapid release of IL-8 by pulmonary macrophages following acute insult (14) . IL-8 is strongly chemotactic for neutrophils and given the presence of numerous neutrophils observed microscopically, would be expected to be significantly elevated. The presence of large numbers of neutrophils adds to the pulmonary injury via the release of inflammatory mediators, e.g., leukotrienes and proteases, a process termed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (29) .",
