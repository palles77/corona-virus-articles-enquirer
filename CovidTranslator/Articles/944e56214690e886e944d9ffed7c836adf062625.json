            "text": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) was known to be the cell receptor for SARS-CoV, and also for some SARS-like bat coronaviruses 16 . Sequence studies found that the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was sufficiently similar to that of SARS-CoV to indicate it could efficiently use the human ACE2 receptor for entry to human cells 6, 7 . Infectivity experiments were undertaken with HeLa cells expressing or not expressing ACE2 from humans, bats, civets, pigs and mice, and the results confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 virus was able to use entry receptors on all ACE2-expressing cells other than mice 5 . Molecular modelling has indicated that the binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE-2 may be even higher than that of SARS-CoV and it may therefore be more efficient at infecting human cells 17 [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , but this information was not widely available until a sequence was reported on 12 January 2020. Interestingly, this was the first time that NGS had alerted the world to a new zoonotic virus before the virus had been isolated, and it suggests that a new procedure for reporting outbreaks based on NGS rather than pathogen isolation and identification needs to be considered 19 . Transmission Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been widely shown in health care, community and family settings. The dominant mode of transmission is from the respiratory tract via droplets or indirectly via fomites, and to a lesser extent via aerosols. In addition, as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can infect the human gastrointestinal tract 21, 22 , it has been suggested that faecal-oral spread may occur for SARS-CoV-2 23 . The reproduction number (Ro) is generally thought to be between 2.0 and 2.8 20,24-27 , although higher reproduction numbers have been suggested in some reports. The mean incubation time appears to be between 4.75 and 7 days 20,23,24,26,28 , ranging from 3 days to an upper limit of around 11-14 days. There is increasing knowledge about the virus load. In one study of symptomatic patients, higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset, with the viral loads higher in the nose than in the throat. In a single asymptomatic patient, the viral load was similar to the symptomatic patients 29 . In a second and more detailed study, the virus load was investigated over Hot Topic consecutive days in two patients from the time of their hospitalisation, with serial samples throat swabs, sputum, urine and stools. The viral loads peaked around 5-6 days after symptom onset, with 10 4 to 10 7 copies/mL. The authors also studied the viral loads in throat swabs, sputum and stool samples in other patients, and found viral loads were as high as 10 11 copies/mL in throat samples, but with a median of 7.99 \u00c2 10 4 , and 7.52 \u00c2 10 5 in sputum. In addition, virus was detected by RT-PCR in stools from 9 of 17 confirmed cases, but at titres lower than in respiratory samples 30 . Several studies have indicated that transmission may occur during the incubation period 31,32 and from asymptomatic or very mild infections 29, 33, 34 .",

Information is also needed on the stability of the virus in the environment to better determine transmission risks, and especially the survival of the virus in aerosols and on hard surfaces under different conditions of temperature and humidity. Clinical features It has become clear that asymptomatic infections and minimally symptomatic infections occur with this virus. Exactly how frequently is not yet known as that requires serological studies that have yet to be undertaken. The initial reports of the illness were heavily biased to more severe and hospitalised cases in China, and as the number of confirmed cases has increased within China and elsewhere, a clearer picture has emerged. The commonest clinical features are fever plus a respiratory illness, and studies have reported fever in 80-99% of cases, dry cough in 48-76% of cases, fatigue or myalgia in 44-70% of cases, and dyspnoea in 30-55% of cases. Other relatively frequent manifestations include anorexia and productive cough, and less frequently, headache, diarrhoea, nausea, dizziness and vomiting 13,39,40 .

Treatment is largely supportive 44 , though a number of therapeutics are under investigation with some undergoing clinical trials in China and elsewhere. Of particular interest currently are the HIV protease inhibitor combination lopinavir/ritonavir and a new broad-spectrum antiviral agent called remdesivir, which has shown promising activity against MERS-CoV in animal models. Combinations of these with interferon-b and/or ribavirin are being considered, while other groups are looking at other antivirals, convalescent plasma, and monoclonal antibodies. Work on vaccines is also well underway, although it is unlikely that a vaccine will be available for at least 18 months. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations (CEPI) is currently funding four vaccine initiatives in collaboration with the WHO. One of these is at The University of Queensland where Prof Paul Young, and Drs Keith Chappell and Dan Watterson are using their novel and exciting 'molecular clamp' technology to develop a vaccine. This work is being carried out in collaboration with CSIRO's vaccine manufacturing plant in Clayton, and also partly funded by CSL Ltd. This Australian collaboration is hoping to have the vaccine ready for use before the end of 2021. Current status The international public health response to COVID-19 has largely been based on measures that have proved successful for many other outbreaks over past decadesrapid identification, management and isolation of cases; identification and follow up of contacts; quarantine measures; social distancing; infection prevention and control in health care settings; community containment; and transparent risk communication; as well as a 14-day quarantine period on travellers from China or who have had links to ongoing transmission sites or known cases, such as the cruise liner in Japan.Australia's response has been similar, and to date has been moderately successful in limiting the number of chains of transmission in NSW, Queensland and Victoria, whereas most cases elsewhere have been in returning travellers or their close contacts.",

This indicates that other potential cross-species events could occur in the future. There is therefore a strong reason to ban unregulated wild animal sales in Chinese wet markets, particularly exotic species, both from a public health perspective and for ecological reasons. Such a ban would be difficult to instigate for cultural reasons, but China's top legislative committee on 24 February 2020, passed a proposal to ban all trade and consumption of wild animals. If this is legislated as a permanent ban, it might help reduce the risk of another novel virus emerging from wildlife in China in the future.",

To ensure that future cross-species transmission events of this new virus don't occur again in the future, it is important to identify the reservoir and intermediate wildlife hosts. The closest known wildlife sequence to SARS-CoV-2 remains the sequence from the virus isolated from an Intermediate horseshoe bat, but there were significant differences in the receptor-binding domain between the two viruses. Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) have been suggested as potential intermediate hosts, and SARS-like viruses have been identified in pangolins seized in anti-smuggling operations in southern China, but they only shared about 85-92%% homology with SARS-CoV-2 18 .
