The application of internal controls to validate the entire process of these assays is necessary to prevent false-negative results caused by unexpected inhibition or inefficient extraction. In the present study, we describe a strategy to produce a stable internal control for rRT-PCR by packaging foreign RNA into influenza virions using plasmid-based reverse genetics technology. The envelope structure of influenza virus can effectively protect RNA segments from RNase digestion, which provides an advantage for its routine use as an internal control. Utilizing this approach, we successfully generated a recombinant influenza virus (rPR8-HCV) containing the 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome. After inactivation and purification, the rPR8-HCV particles were demonstrated to be RNase resistant and stable at 4\u00b0C for at least 252 days in human plasma, with no degradation even after being frozen and thawed multiple times. These results were reproducible in the COBAS TaqMan HCV test for 164 days. Moreover, the chimeric influenza virus particles could be easily produced in embryonated eggs and were noninfectious after inactivation treatment. Additionally, this strategy could also be adapted for real-time clinical applications of other RNA targets, providing a universal approach with broad clinical applications in rRT-PCR assays.",

However, an inherent problem is frequently encountered with false-negative PCR results, caused mainly by the degradation of target RNA and the presence of PCR inhibitors. Therefore, internal controls are incorporated into these assays to ensure reliable PCR results, in which true-negative results can be distinguished from falsenegative results that are due to human error or inhibition (Hoorfar et al. 2004 ).",

However, naked RNA is unstable and susceptible to degradation by RNase (Dreier et al. 2005; Felder and Wolfel 2014) . Furthermore, when using naked RNA as a control, the lysis process is not monitored during RNA extraction, and therefore only partial quality assurance is achieved.

Previous studies have shown that influenza virus carrying a reporter gene, such as GFP, can replicate normally and stably express the reporter gene in infected cells, which makes these viruses feasible for extensive propagation (Li et al. 2010; Manicassamy et al. 2010) . Furthermore, the virion morphology of chimeric viruses is indistinguishable from those of wild-type viruses when observed by electron microscopy, indicating that chimeric viruses may be RNase resistant with lipid envelope protection (Maloney et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2010) .

During the first round of PCR, three separate fragments were amplified as follows. NS1, including the 5\u2032 genomic noncoding region but lacking the 3\u2032 stop codon, and NEP, including the 3\u2032 genomic noncoding region, were amplified from a pHW-NS plasmid (constructed by our laboratory) using primer pairs NS-F/NS1-OL-R (HCV) and NEP-OL-F (HCV)/NS-R. The HCV 5\u2032 UTR with the 3\u2032 PTV-1 2A peptide-coding sequence was amplified from a pMD18-HCV plasmid (constructed by our laboratory) using primers HCV-OL-F (NS1) and HCV-OL-R (NEP). After cleanup, the HCV plus NEP fragment was constructed by subsequent rounds of PCR using primers HCV-OL-F (NS1) and NS-R. PCR products were gel purified. Then, the final round of PCR fused NS1 to the N terminal of HCV-NEP via a short GSG linker using primers NS-F and NS-R. To introduce silent mutations at the splice acceptor site in NS1, nucleotides 524 to 527 (5\u2032-TCCA-3\u2032) were replaced with 5\u2032-CCCG-3\u2032 using primers NS1-M-F and NS1-M-R.

The engineered NS-HCV segment was cloned into the BsmBI site of the pHW2000 vector to generate the chimeric plasmid pHW-NS-HCV. The construct was sequenced across the entire NS gene to confirm insertion.

Forty-eight hours after transfection, supernatants and cells were collected and subsequently inoculated into 10-day-old specific pathogen-free chicken embryos for virus propagation. At 72 h post-inoculation, allantoic fluids were harvested and centrifuged at 5000\u00d7g for 20 min to remove cell debris. The harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to hemagglutination (HA) assay to determine the presence of viruses. To explore the stability of rPR8-HCV, the chimeric viruses were subcultured on chicken embryos for eight passages. RNA was extracted from the serial passages for RT-PCR amplification of the partial NS-HCV gene fragment using primers HCV-OL-F (NS1) and NS-R.",

Equal amounts of rPR8-HCV and isolated RNA from rPR8-HCV were incubated with 1 \u03bcg/\u03bcl RNase A at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. After digestion, the samples were tested by real-time PCR Fig. 4 Stability evaluation of rPR8-HCV particles. rPR8-HCV was added to human plasma to a final concentration of 10 4 and 10 6 IU/ml. Samples were incubated at 4\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, or room temperature for set periods of time. Samples were qualified in duplicate at each time point using a HCV RNA PCR fluorescence quantitative diagnostic kit, and the detection results were averaged. The changes in HCV RNA levels in samples were evaluated by linear regression analysis RNA constructs containing a HCV gene fragment (Colucci et al. 2007 ). For the rPR8-HCV controls, the mean was 18, 120 IU/ml (4.26 log 10 ), with a range of 12,400 to 25,600 IU/ ml and a coefficient of variation of 19.7 %. The positive control provided within the commercial kit had a mean of 961 IU/ ml (2.98 log 10 ), with a range of 693 to 1290 IU/ml and a coefficient of variation of 17.9 %. These results show that the coefficients of variation for the rPR8-HCV controls and for the commercial kit controls were comparable, which demonstrates that the rPR8-HCV control performed as reliably as the controls provided by the commercial kit (Fig. 5) .",

Similarly, we hypothesized that chimeric influenza virus could also be used as internal control for nucleic acid test, because the lipid envelope structure of influenza virus would protect the RNA of interest from adverse effect. To date, chimeric influenza virus carrying a long foreign gene have centered on modifying the neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein (M), or NS genes of the influenza viral genome (Kittel et al. 2005; Li et al. 2010; Manicassamy et al. 2010; Wu et al. 2010) . Thus, we tried to insert the HCV 5\u2032 UTR into one of these three genes and only the chimeric influenza virus carrying the HCV 5\u2032 UTR was successfully generated by utilizing the smallest NS segment. The insertion of HCV 5\u2032 UTR into NS segment is analogous to the NS1-GFP virus, which was previously reported by Manicassamy et al. (Manicassamy et al. 2010) . After that, we evaluated the inactivated and purified chimeric virus particles as an internal control for routine clinical diagnostic rRT-PCR assay. The results show that our obtained chimeric influenza virus is resistant to RNase and is stable, even in plasma, for up to 252 days. Moreover, we also show that our novel HCV positive control is comparable with a commercial armored RNA control when they are used in the real-time PCR detection of HCV.",

As expected, rPR8-HCV particles were found to be resistant to RNase digestion and exhibited improved storage and handling properties, which will ensure Fig. 5 Comparison of the rPR8-HCV positive controls with the COBAS TaqMan HCV test positive controls in a clinical setting. rPR8-HCV was diluted with human plasma to a final concentration of 10 4 IU/ml and was stored at 4\u00b0C in aliquots of 1.0 ml.

Although HCV RNA within the viral particles was not completely stable at temperatures over 4\u00b0C, its stability was preserved in plasma at 4\u00b0C for at least 8 months.

            "text": "Nevertheless, the manipulation of the internal gene faces some potential problems that must be overcome both theoretically and operationally. First, the influenza virus RNA genome is relatively small, and this limits the length of the incorporated target RNA (Garcia-Sastre and Palese 1995). The foreign genes introduced into influenza virus are usually restricted in several hundred nucleotides, which is suitable for most rRT-PCR assays because the RNA length in these assays is usually less than 500 bases. Indeed, the results presented here indicate that a 330-nucleotide HCV RNA sequence could be successfully inserted into virions. A previous report has shown that a GFP gene up to 720 nucleotides could be packaged and propagated using this same strategy, indicating that it is possible to carry a target gene of more than 700 nucleotides (Manicassamy et al. 2010 ). Further investigation is required to determine if this technique will work for inserting longer fragments, which are particularly important for assays based on signal amplification (e.g., bDNA hybridization) instead of sequence amplification (e.g., rRT-PCR). Second, the high mutation rate of the influenza RNA genome may lead to the loss of inserted target genes (Luytjes et al. 1989 ). However, the chimeric rPR8-HCV appeared to be completely genetically stable and was able to replicate to high titers in embryonated eggs. Interestingly, even after eight passages in embryonated eggs, the rPR8-HCV virus still showed no loss of the foreign HCV gene. Finally, infectivity may be a potential disadvantage for the routine use of chimeric influenza viruses as internal controls (Falchieri et al. 2012) . The PR8 influenza virus bears infectivity, but it has strong host specificity for mice. It is noninfectious to humans, and thus there is little danger of accidental infection during manufacture. Furthermore, embryonated egg cultures confirmed that all chimeric viruses had lost their infectivity after inactivation by formaldehyde. Therefore, the chimeric virus particles can be developed as internal controls that present no infection risks, allowing them to be shipped and used safely. Nonetheless, proper clinical laboratory safety precautions should be followed because the chimeric virus particles represent genetically modified organisms.",
