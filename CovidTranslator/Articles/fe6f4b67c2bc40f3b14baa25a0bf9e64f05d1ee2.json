This approach requires only a fraction of the animals normally needed when studying each factor separately. P if in tracheal tissue was measured with the servocontrolled counterpressure system using sharpened micropipettes. The measurements were performed over a period of 60 min and are presented as mean for every 15 min period. The factors investigated in the study were: three strains of female rats (Strain) two brands of diets (Food); two breeder companies (Source); and finally two batches of the same set of animals to repeat the experiment twice (Week), using a total of 48 animals. There was a highly significant effect within Strain the first week (p \u00bc 0:007), but this response was not observed the second week. The interaction between Strain \u00c2 Week was significant (p \u00bc 0:007) while the main effects Strain or Week alone were not significant. The response pattern for Strain and Food was inconsistent for the two experimental weeks studied. These experiments made it possible for us to simultaneously test several factors and exclude these factors as the reason for the observed changes in our experiments since the experiments did not allow the conclusion that one or several of these factors could explain the variation in P if : r",

In animal experiments the rules of the 3 R's: Reduction, Refinement and Replacement (Russell and Burch, 1959) , should be implemented in planning and performing experiments (Flecknell, 2002) . Much focus has been put on standardizing environmental factors known to cause unintended variations of the experiments. Some of the parameters that are known to affect results are temperature, air changes, air humidity, light-dark cycles, microbiological conditions (Poole et al., 1987) . The current investigation, demonstrate how such a study can be performed, when it becomes necessary to perform experiments involving several variables and groups.",

The lowering of P if will increase the transmural driving pressure during the initial phase of an inflammatory challenge. The lowering of P if measured in tracheal tissue of rats following an inflammatory challenge ranges from \u00c04 to \u00c010 mmHg (Gjerde et al., 1997 (Gjerde et al., , 2000 Koller and Reed, 1992; Wei et al., 1998; Woie et al., 1993; Woie and Reed, 1997; Woie and Reed, 1994; Woie and Reed, 1996a; . Under normal (non-inflammatory) conditions P if is slightly subatmospheric and the mean average and standard deviation measured over 60 or 90 min registration period for trachea is \u00c01.45 7 0.36 mmHg. This average is taken from a total of 13 studies and 17 series of experiments containing all together 132 control animals giving a average of 7-8 animals per series (Gjerde et al., 1997 (Gjerde et al., , 2000 (Gjerde et al., , 2002 (Gjerde et al., , 2003 Koller and Reed, 1992; Koller et al., 1993; Wei et al., 1998; Woie et al., 1993 Woie and Reed, 1994 . Figures from previous studies Gjerde et al., 2002) illustrate that the levels of P if in vehicle treated animals are constant throughout the 60 min recording period. The slightly negative P if is one of the forces controlling the filtration over the microcirculatory wall into the interstitium and also acts as a filling pressure for the initial lymphatics (Aukland and Reed, 1993; Levick, 1991) . For all previous studies on changes in P if in rat trachea, female Wistar rats were used, mainly provided from M&B AS (P.O Box 39, DK-8680, Ry, Denmark) and with a very few exceptions delivered by Harlan UK Ltd (Shaw's Farm, Blackthorn, Bicester, Oxon, OX6 0TP, England). These animals were, over the years, first fed with SDS (Special Diets Services, UK), RM1 Maintenance Diet and later, due to changes in the diet routine in the animal facility, the animals were fed with B&K (B&K universal UK) Rodent Low Protein Diet. Over a period of several months we began to observe variable values and quality in the control measurements of P if with values considerably more negative, i.e. with values similar to those observed in inflammation.",

Several environmental factors were improved such as reducing stress by taking special care in the animal handling before and during the experiments. We also improved the conditions at the animal facility by isolating the animals in separate rooms or by placing them in a ventilated cupboard as well as changing the time of the acclimatization period after transport. The conditions with normal P if ; i.e. the control measurements of P if were only partially restored, but with little consistency and with no clear preferences towards any environmental factor. McDonald and collaborators (McDonald, 1988 (McDonald, , 1992 have demonstrated that animals infected with Mycoplasma pulmonis had increased response to neurogenic inflammation. Our animals were delivered by a supplier with regular health monitoring programs and tested negative for mycoplasma as did the sentinels from our animal facility during the actual time period. Also animals were kept in isolators to avoid infection after arrival to the animal facility.",

Measurements of P if were initiated soon thereafter on the abluminal portion of trachea and between the cartilage rings using sharpened glass capillaries (4-10 mm) connected to a servocontrolled counterpressure system (Wiederhielm et al., 1964; Wiig et al., 1981) and continued until 60 min after circulatory arrest. The glass pipettes were filled with 0.5 M NaCl colored with Evans blue. Micropuncture was performed under visual guidance with a microscope (Wild M3C, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) and care was taken to minimize stretch or compression at the site of puncture (Wiig et al., 1981) . The measurements were accepted when the following criteria were met: (1) No change in recorded pressure when increasing feedback gain; (2) Suction applied by the servocontrolled pump should increase electrical resistance in the pipette, verifying open communication to interstitial fluid because of the lower tonicity of the fluid entering the pipette; (3) The baseline measurements before and after P if registration were unchanged. The latter measurement was performed in a plastic cup filled with saline placed at the level of the site of puncture. All surgical manipulations on or near the trachea were performed after circulatory arrest to avoid local inflammation that may increase interstitial fluid volume and confound accurate estimates of P if .",

However, depending on the hypotheses and questions asked, both approaches seem to be valid. In the experimental situation leading to the present study, there was seemingly a random appearance of animals that behaved like ''experimental'' animals while they were in fact controls. In the measurements performed in this study, these animals appeared randomly throughout the cages. The effect of averaging the data from one cage is therefore to minimize an effect that should be present, simply due to the averaging. Therefore, it is not surprising that after averaging the statistical significances disappear.",

In accordance with accepted practice for physiological experiments, we have averaged the measurements within one animal and used this for the subsequent statistical analysis. Our argument in favor of this choice of procedure is that in all previous similar studies, among them the ones leading to the present one, the averaging and analysis have been outlined as described above. We feel that if the study was to be performed based on averaging the animals within one cage, the proper design would actually be to have one animal per cage.

The genetic status of an inbred strain will stay constant over time, like an immortal clone of identical individuals and changes only occur by mutations. An outbred stock like the Wistar rat, is obtained by breeding a closed colony of genetically undefined animals for at least 4 generations. The genetics of an outbred stock might change over time due to genetic drift as a result of random mating within the population. The use of inbred strains gives a larger statistic precision by use of fewer animals. However, they are more sensitive to environmental influences than outbred stocks. The overall choice was to use several different inbred strains. This will increase the generality of the experiment and still have the same genetic material over time. The rationale for using the outbred Wistar is that it has been used for a long time in similar experiments.",

The Strain \u00c2 Week interaction is actually a study of a genotype-environment interaction. The tendency in these experiment is that BN rats show the highest degree of consistency in the experiments between Week, while the outbred Wistar rats give slightly less consistent results than F344, i.e. BNbF344>Wistar.

They identified several genetic differences between the F344-rat and BDE-rats, among others in the mechanisms involved in the plasma protein extravasation in the airways following substance P or capsaicin, since these agents released 5hydroxytryptamine from the mast cells in F344-rats but no BDE-rats . This study has shown that even though we find differences in P if measurements with regard to several of the parameter investigated, none of them were able to restore 'normal control' P if ; i.e. not less than \u00c02 mmHg. Although the experiments were inconclusive with regard to which factor that by itself or in combination with others caused the variability in P if the study demonstrates how several factors can be investigated using a minimum of experimental animals.",
