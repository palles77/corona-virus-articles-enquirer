            "text": "Ever since the emergence of SARS, when we were reminded that the nature of health care practitioners' duty to care is greatly contested, it has remained a polarizing issue. Discussions on the nature and limits of health care practitioners' duty to care during disasters and public health emergencies abounds the literature, ripe with arguments seeking to ground its foundations. However, to date there has been little public engagement on this issue. This study involved three Townhall meetings held between February 2008 and May 2010 in three urban settings in Canada in order to probe lay citizens' views about ethical issues related to pandemic influenza, including issues surrounding the duty to care. Participants included Canadian residents aged 18 and over who were fluent in English. Data were collected through day-long facilitated group discussions using case scenarios and focus group guides. Participant's views were organized according to several themes, including the following main themes (and respective subthemes): 1. Legitimate limits; a) competing obligations; and b) appeal to personal choice; and 2. Legitimate expectations; a) reciprocity; and b) enforcement and planning. Our findings show that participants moved away from categorical notions of the duty to care towards more equivocal and often normative views throughout deliberations. Our analysis contributes a better understanding of the constitutive nature of the duty to care, defined in part by taking account of public views. This broadened understanding can further inform the articulation of acceptable norms of duty to care and policy development efforts. What is more, it illustrates the urgent need for policy-makers and regulators to get clarity on obligations, responsibilities, and accountability in the execution of HCPs' duty to care during times of universal vulnerability.",

So too for front line health care practitioners (HCPs) who face disproportionate risks of serious morbidity and mortality from infection (Ruderman et al., 2006) , leading us to question the boundaries of their duty to care. Ever since SARS when Singer et al. (2003) emphasized that the nature of HCPs' duty to care is historically and philosophically contested, it has remained a polarizing issue.",

            "text": "There has been an ongoing debate surrounding the nature of HCPs' duty to care and over the years there has been a continued evolution of perspective. Broadly speaking, the positions on the extent of an HCPs duty to care has, on the whole, moved from the more absolute and categorical to a more nuanced position. The mid-19th century American Medical Association Code of Ethics was among the first to formally introduce the concept of a physician's duty to care and did so in near-absolute terms by stating that, \" [w] hen pestilence prevails, it is [physicians'] duty to face the danger, and to continue their labors for the alleviation of suffering, even at the jeopardy of their own lives\" (Baker, Caplan, Emanuel, & Latham, 1999, p. 40) . Today, however, while there is continued acceptance of a duty to care on behalf of HCPs, few use as strong of language as does the 1847 Code. Indeed, there has been a consistent recognition that considerations of personal welfare may indeed impose limits on HCPs' duty to care. As Norman Daniels puts it, we find the 1847 AMA Code as being \"too extreme\" and, he argues, \"that there are some limits, however vaguely specified, to the risks physicians have agreed to face\" (Daniels, 1991, p. 38) .",

Therefore, the pertinent question regarding the duty to care shifts from \"whether or not\" to one of \"when and to what extent\" (Clark, 2005a) . Thus, to increase understanding of this issue, we must go beyond assessing (that is, making a case for) whether a duty to care exists during disasters, but rather focus our theoretical, empirical, and policy efforts on further bolstering our understanding of the scope and limits of a duty to care. Some attempts have been made in this direction: on an empirical basis (Balicer, Omer, Barnett, & Everly, 2006; Bensimon, Tracy, Bernstein, Shaul, & Upshur, 2007; Draper et al., 2008; Ehrenstein, Hanses, & Salzberger, 2006; Seale, Leask, Po, & MacIntyre, 2009 ); based on legal jurisprudence (Davies & Zlotnik-Shaul, 2009; Walker, 2002) ; on a conceptual basis (Clark, 2005b) ; or on a philosophical account (Ruderman et al., 2006; van der Weijden, Bredenoord, & van Delden, 2010) . Policy-makers themselves have been spurred by the practical challenges caused by the lack of guidelines regarding duties and obligations during pandemics. Many regulatory bodies too have taken heart, largely in response to the distress this caused during SARS, by addressing the need to define what the duty to care means in practice, especially during disasters or public health emergencies.",

In a previous study conducted by our research team, we sought to describe lay and expert views on the duty to care in the aftermath of SARS (Bensimon et al., 2007) . As part of its research platform, which included different forms of stakeholder engagement and national telephone surveys, the Canadian Program of Research on Ethics in a Pandemic (CanPREP) built on this study by conducting three Townhall meetings across Canada in order to probe participants' views about ethical issues related to pandemic influenza, including issues surrounding the duty to care. A related goal was to enhance the legitimacy of the substantive and procedural values proposed in the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics' seminal report on ethics during a pandemic, which had been developed without public input (University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics Pandemic Influenza Working Group, 2005) . Public engagement on matters of practice and policy, we believe, lends inherent authenticity to the burgeoning policy area and newly-developing standards of practice pertaining to the duty to care during disasters. In this paper, we present findings from the Townhall discussions on the duty to care with the view of further bolstering our empirical understanding of its scope and limits.",

One participant said that, \"clearly, society has a huge role to play.\" Thus, according to participants, the duty to care implies a reciprocal duty to protect: \"We have to do something as a society; do everything we can to protect [HCPs] .\" The negative consequences of not doing so were significant: \"If support is not provided, the whole system will collapse.\"",

Many agreed with the observation that: \"She's [physician] not going to be any good at work if she's [physician] dealing with a crisis at home.\" Although for some participants, the responsibility of provision fell on the institution in which a practitioner worked, while for others it fell on government, most wondered: \"Who is supposed to provide [protective equipment]?;\" \"Who guarantees that everything is adequate?;\" \"Who do you trust [to act] in the best interests of the HCP?\"",

Throughout deliberations, most continued to wonder who ought to have the authority to make these decisions, leaving open the repeated question, \"at what level do you have authority?\" The vast majority, however, concluded that there should not be consequences for not fulfilling a duty. Of the reasons offered in support of that view, the most prominent were that: coercion is \"undemocratic\", and thus \"unacceptable\"; HCPs would be \"no good\" if they were coerced to work; imposing punitive measures, such as back-to-work legislation, which was thought to be \"ridiculous\", would have \"too many implications for the profession\" in that \"it would deter people from going into that line of work\" or urge them to \"leave the medical profession\" altogether. Given these reasons, the most important policy initiative was thought to be one that \"creates a supportive environment for personal decision-making,\" that respects \"individualised circumstantial limits,\" while creating incentives and putting in place supports for HCPs.",

On that basis, it was thought to be wholly legitimate to expect HCPs to care during pandemics despite the inherent risk todand in virtue of their presumed consent to risk bydHCPs. A crucial caveat here is that this expectation applies to those who have taken an oath to care, i.e. physicians.

This finding has important implications for policy-makers and pandemic planners: while it is now widely accepted that HCPs are deemed a priority group for prophylaxis (Gardam et al., 2007; Moghadas, 2010; World Health Organization, 2008) , prioritizing access to treatment based on social value, at least for HCPs, has been equally widely debated or altogether discounted in policy circles.

Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2009) found that, in some regions of Argentina, as many as 40% of health care workers did not go to work during the peak of the pandemic and, in New Zealand, hospital staff absenteeism created temporary stresses on hospitals.

Moreover, much of the duty to care literature discusses the relationship between HCPs' duty and the risks they assume by entering the profession. Indeed, some may suggest that a strict duty to care exists for HCPs during infectious disease outbreaks as these risks are simply part of the job and were assumed by the HCP when he or she entered the profession. However, what is unclear is exactly what risks are assumed by HCPs in their respective professions and clinical responsibilities, and, for trainees, what and how such risks are described. Such questions are important to explore, as answers to these questions could reveal whether or not HCPs are being adequately informed of the risks that may exist in their profession, and what the limits to their duty might be in relation to these risks.
