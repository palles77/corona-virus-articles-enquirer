These tissues were from patients in different hospitals in Singapore who were diagnosed with various microbial infections, including SARS-CoV, that caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Global expression patterns showed limited correlation between end-stage ARDS and the initiating pathogen, but when focusing on a subset of genes implicated in pulmonary pathogenesis, molecular signatures of pulmonary disease were obtained and appeared to be influenced by preexisting pulmonary complications and also bacterial components of infection. Many factors detected during pulmonary damage and repair, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) components, transforming growth factor (TGF) enhancers, acute-phase proteins, and antioxidants, were included in the molecular profiles of these ARDS lung tissues. In addition, differential expression of cytokines within these pulmonary tissues were observed, including notable genes involved in the interferon (IFN) pathway, such as Stat1, IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and IL-18, that are often characterized as elevated in ARDS patients.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] SARS has captured the attention of the world as a new disease, but it has been suggested in clinical terms that SARS is a variant of ARDS attributed to SARSCoV. 5 SARS-CoV does not produce unique cytopathic changes and although suspicious for direct viral effect, the changes seen in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are within the spectrum of those seen in end-stage ARDS-DAD cases initiated by various pathogens. 2 These present studies attempt to provide insight into the host response and ensuing pathogenesis associated with SARS-CoV by using FFPE pulmonary autopsy tissues from Singapore patients diagnosed with assorted microbial infections, including SARS-CoV. Because of the necessarily limited sample size of our study, we chose to focus our efforts on a subset of genes whose roles have been implicated in clinical ARDS and experimental pulmonary stress studies rather than trying to use microarray analysis as a hypothesis-generating discovery tool. Although it is feasible that host response to a pulmonary infection could be traced to the original etiologic agent, current clinical techniques cannot always establish this correlation. Therefore, we sought to determine molecular signatures of ARDS lung disease and if it was possible to distinguish ARDS cases initiated by SARS-CoV",

Therefore, transcription profiling of pulmonary tissues was used to determine signatures of lung disease progression and whether SARS-CoV-induced ARDS (+ARDS-4 and +ARDS-5) could be distinguished from other ARDS cases (\u2212ARDS-1, \u2212ARDS-2, and \u2212ARDS-3). FFPE tissues are amenable to preserving diagnostic qualities, yet the fixation process has previously limited their use in molecular biology applications because of modifications of RNA by formalin. Although these fixed tissues are not considered optimal for obtaining pristine RNA, methods are available for recovery of amplifiable RNA from these sources. 6 Characterization of extracted total RNA and processed amplified RNA from these pulmonary clinical samples, as well as comparable control tissue sources (nonhuman primate; data not shown), showed a range of total RNA fragmentation sizes (100-2000 bp) but similar average amplified RNA fragmentation sizes (~750 bp), suggesting that sufficient concentrations of intact total RNA were present to attempt gene expression studies (Fig. 1) .",

It should be noted that these matched tissues came from a pulmonary sample that had been halved and then fixed in two different manners. A portion was placed in RNAlater (fresh) and a portion was placed in formalin (fixed). The formalin tissue was then paraffin embedded using standard techniques. The idea of doing a direct microarray comparison is grounded in the idea that if the mRNA populations and gene expression were identical in both the tissue samples, regardless of tissue fixation method used, zero genes would be detected by microarray that would be identified as differentially expressed. Contrarily, any gene that would be identified as differentially expressed by microarray could be further defined as variable between tissue samples due to tissue fixation methods (that chemically modify RNA) or tissue slice position in original stock tissue sample. This direct microarray comparison of matched primate FFPE tissues and fresh tissues showed ~3% of the genes were differentially expressed (Fig. 2 ). This demonstrates that even though there is some variability in the transcription profile elucidated from tissues that have undergone extensive chemical processing, ~97% of the information gained from the FFPE tissues concurs with that obtained from fresh tissues. As a reference, direct microarray comparisons of adjacent slices of FFPE tissue, as well as comparisons of adjacent slices of fresh tissue, showed ~0.1% of the genes to be differentially expressed, indicating that by gene expression characterization, these tissues really can be defined as same.",

This experimental design would, thus, highlight differences in pathogenesis among the various infectious agents and host responses, stratifying disease states, rather than differences between disease and health. This was to alleviate any concern that the use of autopsy samples at end-stage of disease would focus on attributes of autopsy tissue. In addition, although a reference source of a non-ARDS donor would have been more conventional and allowed us to investigate all aspects of the host response during ARDS, the use of a pooled ARDS reference allowed us to investigate whether pathogen-specific host responses could be elucidated, more specifically a unique molecular signature of SARS-induced ARDS. The microarray data are plotted as a heat map, a grid of colored points where each matrix entry represents a gene expression value, with red corresponding to high expression, green corresponding to low expression, and black corresponding to an intermediate level of expression. Hierarchical clustering methods are used to order rows (genes) and columns (samples) and to allow one to identify groups of samples that have similar expression level patterns and genes that are similar across samples. 11, 12 Global analysis showed that \u2212ARDS-1 and +ARDS-5 clustered together (Color Plate 1B). Because adenovirus was detected in \u2212ARDS-1 and SARS-CoV and Mucor sp. and Aspergillus sp. were detected in +ARDS-5, clustering was not due to the initiating infectious agent. Curiously, however, it can be noted that \u2212ARDS-2, \u2212ARDS-3, and +ARDS-4 each tested positive for a bacterial infection, suggesting a potential gene expression pattern associated with infections containing a bacterial component.",

Using these analyses, many of the cytokines that make up the heat map in Color Plate 3 (36 of 61) could also be defined as genes that discern between \u00b1 preexisting pulmonary conditions (asthma or CHF); this is indicated by the blue bar.

Key events taking place at sites of matrix remodeling may not necessarily be reflected by soluble markers in BAL fluid, and our results from lung tissues prove to be more relevant. In addition, a few of the genes that make up the pulmonary damage and repair heat map in Color Plate 2 (6 of 51) were selected as genes that discern between \u00b1 SARS effect, as indicated by the yellow bar, most prominently MMP-8 and selectin P ligand (SELPLG), which were observed to have a decrease in gene expression in +ARDS-4 and +ARDS-5 compared with the other ARDS samples. As illustrated in Color Plate 2, MMP-8 and SELPLG tend to discern the two ANOVA groups (\u00b1 SARS), whereas phospholipase A2, group IIA (PLA2G2A), immunoglobulin kappa constant (IGKC), immunoglobulin lambda constant 2 (IGLK2), and insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R) do not appear exclusive to one group. This is due to the nature of ANOVA analysis, and these represent genes that can be followed up with larger samples sizes to better understand how they segregate.

Microarray molecular signatures obtained from pulmonary autopsy FFPE tissue samples correlated to what is currently known from studying soluble protein markers in either BAL fluids or sera samples from both ARDS and SARS patients. Even though more clinical samples in our study would have contributed to increased statistical significance, these small studies are not unprecedented. 21, 22 The recurring clustering of \u2212ARDS-1 and +ARDS5 hinted that pathogenesis may potentially be influenced by preexisting pulmonary complications. Although neither asthma (\u2212ARDS-1) nor CHF (+ARDS-5) contribute directly to DAD, each disease has associated pulmonary components that could be considered a factor during subsequent infectious challenge and ensuing pathogenesis. 20, [23] [24] [25] This parallels previous suggestions that patient outcome is related to the magnitude and duration of the host inflammatory response and independent of the precipitating cause of ARDS. 13 Another point of interest is that +ARDS-4, having rapid disease progression (~4 days), showed a number of strongly upregulated cytokine signaling genes. These results suggest that if tissues were investigated earlier in disease progression, gene expression might reveal more insights into pathogenesis based on original pulmonary insult. This is similar to findings that early death (\u22643 days) is related to the condition precipitating ARDS. 13 In addition, \u2212ARDS-2, \u2212ARDS-3, and +ARDS-4 samples contained various pathogens, yet each had a bacterial component to their infection. Although it is outside the scope of this discussion to attempt to detail the host response to individual pathogen components or to use microarrays as a hypothesis-generating discovery tool (considering our sample size), it is believed that as samples are added to create a respiratory pathogen compendium, a more comprehensive view of ARDS progression at the genetic level would be able to supersede current characterization of ARDS at the clinical level. The quality of total RNA extracted from tissues and amplified RNA was characterized using capillary electrophoresis. The ladder is observed as six distinct bands with sizes of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 kb.

Macaque tissues were excised and preserved in RNA-later or FFPE and then processed to extract total RNA.

The microarray experiment was a direct comparison of the FFPE tissue with the fresh tissue, incorporating reverse dyelabeling techniques and resulting in four measurements for each gene, as described in Materials and Methods. Doing a direct microarray comparison is grounded in the idea that if the mRNA populations and gene expression were identical in both the tissue samples, regardless of tissue fixation method used, zero genes would be detected by microarray that would be identified as differentially expressed. Selecting for a fold change >2 and p \u2264 0.05, 64 genes were shown to be differentially expressed from a total of 2171 unique genes to give ~3% differentially expressed genes. Signature genes (64 genes) are defined as those genes being upregulated (19 genes) and those genes being downregulated (45 genes). Downregulated refers to genes showing an increase in gene expression compared with the reference sample, and upregulated refers to genes showing a decrease in gene expression compared with the reference sample. This demonstrates that even though there is some variability in the transcription profile elucidated from tissues that have undergone extensive chemical processing, ~97% of the information gained from the FFPE tissues concurs with that obtained from fresh tissues. change \u22652 and p \u2264 0.05 is indicated by n1(n2), with n1 being % of signature genes differentially expressed and with n2 being the % of total number of genes on the microarray differentially expressed.

This experimental design would, thus, highlight differences in pathogenesis among the various infectious agents and host responses, stratifying disease states, rather than differences between disease and health. This was to alleviate any concern that the use of autopsy samples at end-stage of disease, would focus on attributes of autopsy tissue. (A) Numerical summary of microarray data. The number of genes upregulated or downregulated with fold- Expression profile of genes involved in pulmonary stresses. A subset of genes was investigated using a pulmonary stress bioset and selecting for fold change \u22652 and p \u2264 0.05 parameters in two of five experiments, as discussed in Materials and Methods. Again, to determine additional nuances, ANOVA was used as Color Plate 3. There were a number of genes attributed to ARDS cases having preexisting pulmonary complications (blue bar) and a few genes attributed to a SARS effect (yellow bar). Marked acute-phase and mild organizing with high parenchymal involvement a Pathologic features of pulmonary tissues were examined by histopathology as an initial attempt to classify these features in accordance with patient clinical information and possibly etiologic agent. The numbers of macrophages and neutrophils seen within alveolar spaces of ARDS initiated by SARS-CoV samples did not appear to be significantly different from that typically seen with other ARDS samples with organizing DAD. Briefly, histologic features of ARDS-4 were similar to those of other SARS cases of shorter duration (10 or fewer days), whereas ARDS-5 was also of shorter duration, but histologic features were similar to those of other SARS cases of longer duration (more than 10 days). Preinfection, ARDS-5 had congestive heart failure (CHF), which may account for the observed histologic features more typical of cases of longer duration.",
