This virus is widespread and causes disease characterized by abortions and stillbirth, increased pre-weaning mortality and respiratory disorders in growing pigs. Although PRRSV alone is considered a primary pathogen, co-infections with bacterial and viral pathogens like porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), swine influenza, porcine respiratory coronavirus, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae or Streptococcus suis commonly occur and exacerbate clinical symptoms in growing pigs (Dorr et al., 2007) . As a consequence, PRRSV is one of the most significant causes of economic losses in the swine industry worldwide (Neumann et al., 2005) .",

Two genotypes are recognized, represented by two prototypes: Lelystad virus (European type or genotype I PRRSV) and VR-2332 (American type or genotype II PRRSV) (Wensvoort et al., 1991; Collins et al., 1992) . The European type strains can be further divided into at least three subtypes: Veterinary Microbiology 163 (2013) 1-12 Pan-European subtype 1 and Eastern European subtypes 2 and 3 (Stadejek et al., 2008) . Between the European subtypes, differences have been described in virulence of strains. One Eastern European subtype 3 strain, Lena, was described to be more virulent than a subtype 1 strain, as determined by clinical manifestations in infected pigs under experimental conditions (Karniychuk et al., 2010) . The mechanisms by which a PRRSV strain exerts its virulence are unknown, but it has been suggested to be related to in vivo replication capacity, tissue distribution, or immunomodulatory properties (Haynes et al., 1997; Johnson et al., 2004; Loving et al., 2008) .",

In comparison to other viral infections such as porcine influenza virus or porcine coronavirus, an altered innate immune response was observed with lower levels of IFN type I after infection with some PRRSV strains (Van Reeth et al., 1999) . The adaptive immune response is usually weak and delayed. Although an abundant virus-specific antibody response is induced, this exhibits minimal virus neutralization activity (Kimman et al., 2009) . The cellmediated immune response, as measured by PRRSVspecific IFN-g secreting cells, is late compared to other pathogens (Meier et al., 2003) .

Only a limited number of studies have used European type strains for infection (Diaz et al., 2005; G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2009) , and no information is available about immunological responses to the more virulent European subtype 3 strains. The aim of the present study was to characterize the immune response after infection with two European subtype 1 strains, Belgium A and the prototype Lelystad-Ter Huurne (LV) virus, and a virulent subtype 3 strain, Lena. This subtype 3 strain had caused severe clinical signs and 40% mortality in a previous study (Karniychuk et al., 2010) .

All pigs were confirmed negative for PCV2 by PCR one week prior to transport, since PRRSV and PCV2 co-infection can increase the severity of disease and cause post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (Grau-Roma et al., 2011) . To harmonize the genetic background of pigs across experimental groups, four male pigs of each sixteen sows were selected, and evenly distributed between four groups. The four groups were housed in different rooms of an isolation unit. Between rooms, clothing, footwear and gloves were changed and materials needed for sampling and rectal temperature monitoring were provided separately for each room. Standard feed for finishing pigs was provided once a day, and the pigs had unlimited access to water.",

Primer sequences of IL-1b were obtained from Wichgers Schreur et al. (2011) , IL-10 from Chaung et al. (2010) , TNF-a from De Greeff et al. (2010) , and IFN-a from Durand et al. (2009) . Serial dilutions of pGem-T Easy plasmids containing the PCR fragment of interest were used as internal standards. C t values for the tested cytokines in each sample were expressed as cDNA quantity (ng) using the internal standards. Subsequently, the cytokine levels were normalized with the ng levels of the house keeping gene 18S rRNA. The data were expressed as the fold induction compared to the control group.",

Infection with the subtype 3 strain Lena resulted in clinical signs, in contrast to infection with the subtype 1 strains, which did not induce fever or clinical signs. In a previous study with this strain in 6-week-old conventional pigs, clinical signs were more severe than in the present study and 40% of the pigs died within 3 weeks post-inoculation (Karniychuk et al., 2010) . The severity of clinical signs and death of the pigs in that study might have been due to secondary infections, since Arcanobacterium pyogenes and S. suis were isolated from the lungs of two pigs. We used pigs from a farm with a specific-pathogenfree status and pigs were kept under animal biosafety level 3 conditions, which would prevent introductions of infectious agents. This could explain the different clinical outcome between the studies, although it cannot be excluded that differences in severity of clinical signs were caused by other factors such as differences in pig breed (Lewis et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Fever was only observed in pigs infected with the Lena strain. These pigs had around 100 times higher virus loads during the peak of infection, and higher cytokine levels in blood, mainly TNF-a, compared to the other strains. A relationship between TNF-a production/response in blood and the pathogenicity of PRRSV strains has been demonstrated before (Liu et al., 2010) . It was described that the highly pathogenic American genotype PRRSV strain HuN4, which induces fever and clinical signs, induced higher levels of TNF-a in blood early in infection than its derivative strain HuN4-F112 of lower virulence (Liu et al., 2010) . The HuN4 also replicated faster and to higher titers than the HuN4-F112 strain. The higher virus replication most likely means more trigger of innate immune defences, more cytokine production and more inflammation, resulting in fever. The level of IFN-g secreting cells was used to measure the efficiency of the adaptive cellular immune response. The level of IFN-g secreting cells remained low for pigs infected with the Lena strain, but for pigs infected with the ''a'' denotes a significant difference (p < 0.05) between Lena and Belgium A-infected pigs; ''b'' between Lena and LV-infected pigs; ''c'' between Lena and control pigs; ''d'' between Belgium A and LV-infected pigs; ''e'' between Belgium A and control pigs; and ''f'' between LV and control pigs. Belgium A (from day 14 p.i) or LV strain (from day 21 p.i.), an increase in IFN-g secreting cells was observed compared to the control pigs. This would indicate that the subtype 1 strains Belgium A and LV induce a cellmediated immune response, in contrast to pigs infected with the Lena strain. Interestingly, the level of IFN-g secreting cells of the Belgium A-infected pigs was high (maximum average of 647 IFN-g secreting cells/10 6 PBMC), compared to the LV strain (maximum average of 132 IFN-g secreting cells/10 6 PBMC). Most studies with both European and American genotype strains showed levels lower than 100 IFN-g secreting cells/10 6 PBMC before day 33 p.i. (Diaz et al., 2005; Batista et al., 2004) . It is not clear why the level of IFN-g secreting cells of the Belgium A-infected pigs was that high. Besides a stronger induction of the IFN-g response in vivo, it is also possible that the Belgium A strain has a stronger ability to stimulate cells in vitro in the ELISPOT assay. This has been observed for other strains previously by D\u00edaz et al. (2012) . For all strains, virus could be isolated from day 3 p.i. and peaked between days 7 and 14 p.i., then decreased strongly after day 14 p.i. During the decrease of viremia, an increase of NK cells was observed, mainly for the Belgium A and LV strain, which could be related to viral clearance. Beside the role of NK cells in virus clearing, cytotoxic T cells might have been involved in the clearing at the end of the experiment. Cytotoxic T cells were higher than in the control pigs for all infected groups at day 26 p.i., although only significantly higher for LV-infected pigs. This higher level of cytotoxic T cells coincided with a peak in IFN-g secreting cells. The increase observed in the cytotoxic T cell level could (partly) be related to clonal expansion of PRRSV-specific T cells, although this increase could also be due to a homeostatic regulation of the infection and inflammation. A relationship between viral clearance and cytotoxic T cells has been previously observed in pigs infected with European and American genotype strains (Lamontagne et al., 2003; G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2009 ). However, others failed to show that CD3 + CD8 high cells exert CTL activity toward LV-infected alveolar macrophages (Costers et al., 2009) . Further studies should determine whether the PRRSV-specific cytotoxic T cell activity in vivo is involved in viral clearance. It has been described for PRRSV that the polyclonal activation of B cells occurs mainly in lymphoid organs (Lamontagne et al., 2001; Diaz et al., 2005) . The mobilization of these cells to tissue may explain the decrease in frequency of B cells in blood of the infected pigs. The activation of B cells in the lymph nodes could have resulted in the production of PRRSV-specific antibodies that were detected in blood from day 10 p.i. During the last week of the experiment at day 26 p.i., the level of B cells of the infected pigs was higher than the control pigs, at which point the level of PRRSV-specific antibodies was also at a peak. A similar course of CD21+ B cell levels in blood has been observed previously (Shi et al., 2008) . Others, however, observed either an increase or a decrease in CD21+ cells for at least 4 weeks after infection with a European genotype strain (Diaz et al., 2005; G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2009) . Although in our study higher levels of B cells were observed in infected pigs than in the control pigs at the end of the experiment, this did not contribute to viral clearance by the production of neutralizing antibodies. The absence of neutralizing antibodies has been observed for infections with European genotype strains before (Diaz et al., 2005) . However, others found neutralizing antibodies with the Lelystad strain around week 3-4 p.i. . The difference in results can be attributed to differences in the virus neutralization test method. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that there were small amounts of neutralizing antibodies at day 33 p.i., but the level remained below the detection limit of the virus neutralization test used.",

For PRRSV, it has been shown in vitro that the type I IFN response is suppressed (Ait-Ali et al., 2011) . There are, however, conflicting reports of PRRSV inhibiting or inducing a type I IFN response in vivo (Van Reeth et al., 1999; G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2009 ). In the present study an increase in IFN-a mRNA in blood was observed at day 7 p.i. for the Lena and Belgium A-infected pigs, in parallel with the viral load. No increased level of IFN-a mRNA production was observed in the group of LV-infected pigs. This can be the result of differences between strains in IFNa induction, as has been described to occur in in vitro studies with infection of porcine alveolar macrophages with different PRRSV strains (Lee et al., 2004) , or different infection/replication kinetics of this strain in combination with the short-lived nature of mRNA in blood.",

Gamma delta T cells can act as antigen presenting cells or induce cytotoxic responses. Regulatory functions have been demonstrated in mice and humans (Gerner et al., 2009) . After infection with PRRSV, they can respond by proliferation and production of IFN-g (Olin et al., 2005) . In the present study, the level of CD8 \u00c0 gd T cells decreased to a significantly lower level than the control pigs for the Lena and Belgium A-infected pigs at the peak of viremia. This level returned to normal for the Belgium A-infected pigs at day 21 p.i. A similar course as for the Belgium A-infected pigs in the level of gd T cells has been observed after infection with an American genotype strain (Shi et al., 2008) . However, for the Lena-infected pigs, the level of CD8 \u00c0 gd T cells remained low until the end of the experiment at day 33 p.i. Because of the role of these cells in innate and adaptive responses, this could result in increased susceptibility or a decreased response to secondary infections, such as those observed for the lower response of Lena-infected pigs to immunization with ADV.",

There are, however, contradicting results about the immunomodulating effect of PRRSV (De Bruin et al., 2000; Murtaugh et al., 2002; Suradhat et al., 2006; Jung et al., 2009) . These contradicting results could, amongst other things, be caused by the differences in virus strains used. In the current study, ADV immunization was used to study the effect of the PRRSV strains on the humoral immune response to another antigen. It was shown that infection with Lena influenced the development of an antibody response against ADV. This was in contrast to infection with the LV or Belgium A strains. The results with the LV strain were in agreement with the results of De Bruin et al. (2000) , who also showed that there was no effect of the LV strain infection on the antibody development against ADV. For more virulent strains like Lena, it has been shown before that infection can suppress the immune system. Infection with American genotype isolates that caused clinical signs resulted in classical swine fever virus vaccine failure or increased disease after a secondary infection with porcine respiratory coronavirus (Suradhat et al., 2006; Jung et al., 2009 ). In the present study, the mechanisms behind the delayed ADV antibody response of pigs infected with the Lena strain might be the lower level of T helper cells, CD8 \u00c0 gd T cells and B cells in blood of these Lena infected pigs before the first immunization at day 7 p.i., possibly resulting in a lower level of effector cells.",

The virulence of the strain seemed to be mostly affecting the cell populations and cytokine levels in blood. Although several mechanisms behind the difference in virulence have been discussed, further studies on cell populations and cytokine production in tissues should provide more insight in the mechanisms behind immune modulation by different virus strains. This knowledge on immune modulation by PRRSV should aid the development of intervention strategies such as improved vaccines or other therapeutic agents.",
