            "text": "Attaching and effacing Escherichia coli are involved in diarrhea in 2 to 8-week old calves. The virulence factors of these bacteria include: (i) the secretion of proteins (i.e. EspB) involved in microvilli effacement, (ii) the production of the intimin, a 94 kDa outer membrane protein encoded by the eaeA gene and involved in the intimate attachment of bacteria to epithelial cell and (iii) the production of verotoxins: VT1 and/or VT2. We investigated the presence and the pathotype of these strains in several calf populations by colony hybridization or by genetic amplification. Using the colony hybridization method we showed first that only 5% of calves who died from diarrhea presented EaeA E. coli strains and secondly that 19% of healthy calves showed an asymptomatic carriage. However, using colony hybridization and genetic amplification, we identified EaeA strains in 91% of calves living in farms with recurrent diarrhea problems. In 66% of the calves, there was a correlation between the presence of AEEC and diarrhea. At the pathotype level, most of the EaeA isolates were negative for VT probes. In VT bacteria, the majority were VT1. The number of VT positive bacteria was significantly higher in calves who died from diarrhea than in healthy or sick calves. This underlined the aggravating role of verotoxins in the disease. Moreover, only 25% of the bovine AEEC were positive with the EaeB probe. Surprisingly, the proportion of EaeB strains was significantly higher in healthy calves than in other populations. # 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.",

First, the bacteria adhere to the epithelial cell via the production of fimbriae. Second, the bacteria secrete proteins (i.e. EspB encoded by the eaeB gene) which are responsible for the transmission of a signal to the epithelial cell (Kenny and Finlay, 1995) . These cells respond by an increase in phosphorylations and in intracellular Ca 2 level. The Ca 2 ions activate villin which severs actin filaments leading to the destruction of microvilli. Third, the bacteria adhere intimately to epithelial cells. This intimate attachment is correlated both with the expression by the bacteria of a 94 kDa outer membrane protein called intimin and with the accumulation of cytoskeletal compounds such as actin in the cell beneath the bound bacteria. The intimin is encoded by the eaeA gene. This gene is present in human and in bovine AEEC as demonstrated by colony hybridization studies using the EaeA probe (Jerse et al., 1990; Mainil et al., 1993) . Moreover, the intimin has been demonstrated to be a virulence factor in vivo (Donnenberg et al., 1993a) .",

The seven chosen farms showed the same profile: recurrent diarrhea problems in spite of vaccination (against rotavirus, coronavirus and ETEC) and antibiotherapy. The presence of EPEC and EHEC was checked by colony hybridization and by PCR on fecal samples. EaeA isolates were detected by colony hybridization in each farm (Fig. 1) , but the percentage of positive fecal samples ranged from 11% to 63% according to the farm.

However no large scale epidemiological study has been carried out to verify this association mainly because of the difficulty in the diagnosis of the AEEC. We performed such a study in calves dead from diarrhea, in diarrheic calves, and in healthy calves, based on the detection, either by colony hybridization or by PCR, of the eaeA gene coding for the intimin protein, an adhesin which plays a central role in the pathogenesis of AEEC, which is essential for the production of AE lesions by bovine AEEC Goffaux et al., 1997) , and which is produced in vivo during infection in man (Donnenberg et al., 1993a) .",

Moreover, in the literature, the rates of detection and isolation of AEEC are a function of the calf age ( Fig. 3) with the calculated mean age at 5 weeks which is in perfect correlation with previous studies (Butler and Clarke, 1994) . Although the proportion of AEEC strains seems to be related to the proportion of animal loss in the farms as indicated by the fact that in farm 5 presenting the highest incidence of AEEC, 35 calves died from diarrhea the year before this study. Nevertheless, the AEEC strains do not very often cause the death of the calves, as evidenced by the low percentage of positive isolates from dead calves. These two calf populations were however different so that no definite conclusion can be drawn from these data. The role of AEEC strains in the development of diarrhea may also be questioned as asymptomatic carriage appears to be frequent in healthy calves both from farms with and without problems of diarrhea. However, the history of these healthy calves is unknown: they may have recovered from the disease at the time of sampling or succumbed thereafter. Moreover the proportion of calves with diarrhea and AEEC (66%) was significantly higher than the proportion of healthy calves with AEEC (25% in farms with diarrhea and 24% in farms without diarrhea).",

Determination of the serotype may help in confirming this hypothesis but was not performed on the AEEC isolated from live calves in this study. Otherwise AEEC isolates from dead calves in Belgium belong to O5, O18, O26, O111, and O118 serogroups (Mainil et al., 1993; data not shown) , and the rate of isolation of O157 isolates is very low in Belgium at slaughterhouses (Mainil et al., unpublished data; G.
