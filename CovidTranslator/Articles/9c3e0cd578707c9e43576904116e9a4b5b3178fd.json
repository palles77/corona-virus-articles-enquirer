Patients were randomly assigned (1:1), via an internet-based allocation sequence with random permuted blocks, to have a molecular POC test for respiratory viruses or routine clinical care. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who received antibiotics while hospitalised (up to 30 days). Secondary outcomes included duration of antibiotics, proportion of patients receiving single doses or brief courses of antibiotics, length of stay, antiviral use, isolation facility use, and safety. Analysis was by modified intention to treat, excluding patients who declined intervention or were withdrawn for protocol violations. This study is registered with ISRCTN, number 90211642, and has been completed. , we enrolled 720 patients (362 assigned to POCT and 358 to routine care). Six patients withdrew or had protocol violations. 301 (84%) of 360 patients in the POCT group received antibiotics compared with 294 (83%) of 354 controls (difference 0\u00b76%, 95% CI \u22124\u00b79 to 6\u00b70; p=0\u00b784).

Mean length of stay was shorter in the POCT group (5\u00b77 days [SD 6\u00b73]) than in the control group (6\u00b78 days [7\u00b77]; difference \u22121\u00b71, 95% CI \u22122\u00b72 to \u22120\u00b73; p=0\u00b70443).

However, the primary outcome measure failed to capture differences in antibiotic use because many patients were started on antibiotics before the results of POCT could be made available. Although POCT was not associated with a reduction in the duration of antibiotics overall, more patients in the POCT group received single doses or brief courses of antibiotics than did patients in the control group. POCT was also associated with a reduced length of stay and improved influenza detection and antiviral use, and appeared to be safe.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory tract infections are responsible for a huge burden of disease and are the third most common cause of death worldwide. 1, 2 Although bacteria were previously considered to be the principal aetiological agents of severe respiratory tract infections, the global import ance of respiratory viruses in this group has been increasingly recognised in recent years. [3] [4] [5] [6] Around 700 000 emergency hospital admissions with acute respiratory infection (including exacerbations of chronic lung disease) occurred in England in 2014-15, with approximately 50 000 deaths. 7 Recent, large studies using modern molecular diagnostic tests have shown that respiratory viruses are detectable in around 40-50% of hospitalised adults with acute respiratory illness. 4, 8 Testing for respiratory viruses in hospitalised adults is done on the basis of clinical suspicion rather than routinely, and relies on laboratory-based PCR testing. Although highly accurate, the turnaround time of laboratory PCR in the UK is generally 24-48 h, and requires specialist, centralised laboratory facilities. Previously, point-of-care testing (POCT) for respiratory viruses has been mainly limited to antigen-based tests for influenza. These tests have insufficient sensitivity, especially in adults, 9 and randomised controlled trials have failed to show clinical or health economic benefits in hospitalised adults with acute respiratory illness. 10 Rapid molecular testing platforms for respiratory viruses have been developed with broadly equivalent diagnostic accuracy to laboratory PCR, and some of these platforms are potentially deployable as POC tests. One such platform is the US Food and Drug Administration-approved and European Conformity-marked FilmArray Respiratory Panel (BioFire; Salt Lake City, UT, USA), which tests for a comprehensive range of viruses, is relatively simple to use, and gives a result in 1 h. [11] [12] [13] [14] Antimicrobial resistance is arguably one of the greatest threats to global human health and is driven by overuse of antibiotics. Antibiotics are prescribed to most patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness, including clinical groups in which viruses are strongly implicated in as the cause and no evidence for benefit exists, such as patients with asthma exacerbations 15, 16 and some patients with exacerbation of COPD. 17 Diagnostic uncertainty regarding microbial aetiology contributes to this practice, and so the potential benefits of molecular POCT for viruses in hospitals include a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic use. 18 Other important potential benefits of POCT include reductions in hospital length of stay, improvements in influenza detection with subsequent directed rather than empirical antiviral use, and rationalisation of hospital isolation facilities. How ever, no high-quality evidence exists to support use of molecular POCT. We aimed to address this evidence gap by doing a pragmatic, randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of routine molecular POCT in adults presenting to hospital with acute respiratory illness, on a broad range of clinical outcomes.",

We excluded studies using antigen-based tests for respiratory viruses, studies in children, and studies reporting only diagnostic accuracy. We found no Cochrane systematic reviews in adults. We found no high-quality randomised controlled trials of molecular POCT evaluating clinical outcomes. We found one small randomised controlled trial evaluating the effect of rapid (not point-of-care) molecular testing for viruses (combined with procalcitonin testing) on antibiotic use in hospitalised adults with non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infection.

We chose this outcome after publication of a Cochrane review 19 on the clinical effect of POCT for influenza in children that concluded existing evidence was insufficient to make recommendations and that random ised controlled trials were urgently needed with antibiotic use as an outcome measure. Additionally, small non-randomised studies 20 have suggested reductions in the proportion of patients prescribed antibiotics when tested for influenza with POCT. To capture the entire range of clinically relevant antibiotic changes associated with POCT, we selected the following key secondary outcome measures: duration of antibiotic use (with a cutoff at 30 days), proportion of patients receiving only a single dose of antibiotics, proportion of patients receiving less than 48 h of antibiotics, proportion of patients receiving intravenous antibiotics, and duration of intravenous anti biotics (with a cutoff at 30 days). Because the aim of this trial was to evaluate other potential clinical benefits of POCT for respiratory viruses and not just antibiotic use, non-antibiotic secondary outcome measures were proportion of patients admitted, hospital length of stay, proportion of patients with prolonged inpatient stay (defined as \u22657 days), turnaround time of respiratory virus testing, proportion of patients with viruses detected, proportion of patients with in fluenza detected, proportion of patients with confirmed influenza treated with neuraminidase inhibitors, pro portion of all neuraminidase inhibitor use occurring in patients with confirmed influenza, time to neur aminidase inhibitor use, duration of neur aminidase inhibitor use, proportion of patients admitted to a hospital side room, duration of side room use, and time to isolation or de-isolation. Durationbased endpoints were not prespecified, and choice of mean or median was dependent on various factors, including distribution and sample size, and made after the data had been collected.

We compared duration of antibiotic use (recorded in hours; analysed and presented in days) between groups using mean difference and un adjusted rate ratio. We further assessed the effect of group using the adjusted rate ratio from multiple negative binomial regression, controlling for the same covariates as for the multiple logistic regression. For other secondary outcomes, we compared the intervention and control groups using differences in proportions for binary data, and t tests and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous data (eg, turnaround time), as appropriate; the choice between the latter two tests was based on the distribution of the observed data and the sample size.

            "text": "This large, pragmatic, randomised controlled trial is the first, to our knowledge, to report on the effect of routine molecular POCT for viruses, on a broad range of clinical outcomes including antibiotic use, length of hospital stay, influenza antiviral use, isolation facility use, and safety. The results showed that a routine molecular POCT strategy in adults presenting to secondary care with acute respiratory illness led to a higher detection rate of viruses and a faster turnaround time for results Data are n (%) or mean (SD). Medians are reported in the appendix for completeness. POCT=point-of-care testing. *For hospitalised influenza-positive patients only. \u2020Oseltamivir is given twice daily. \u2021Side room data only available for the second season of the study (PCOT n=191; control n=194). \u00a7Includes influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. \u00b6For patients not empirically isolated at admission, but subsequently found to be influenza positive. ||For patients isolated empirically on admission for suspected influenza infection, but subsequently found to be influenza negative. Table 6 : Neuraminidase inhibitor use and hospital isolation facility use compared with laboratory PCR, but did not reduce the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics or the overall duration of antibiotics compared with routine clinical care. However, it did lead to an increased proportion of patients receiving single doses and brief (<48 h) courses of antibiotics, without any evidence of harm. The reason that the increase in single doses and brief courses did not translate into an overall reduction in the duration of antibiotics is likely to relate to the uniformly high use of prolonged antibiotics in certain clinical groups, especially patients with pneumonia (mean duration of around 9 days), which was not affected by POCT. Our subgroup analyses suggest that the increase in single doses and brief courses of antibiotics occurred mainly in patients with exacerbation of airways disease, and in these groups POCT was associated with a significant reduction in antibiotic duration. Our analysis also suggests that this reduction in antibiotic use occurs mainly in those patients testing positive for respiratory viruses and that a positive test reduces antibiotic duration by leading clinicians to stop antibiotics earlier, after a single dose or a brief course of 1-2 days, rather than completing a standard 5-7 day course. Although premature discontinuation of an antibiotic course has previously been regarded as inadvisable owing to concerns over generating resistance, evidence suggests that early discontinuation is safe from this perspective and is in fact associated with a reduced risk of drug resistance. 22 Around 200 000 patients are hospitalised with exacerbation of asthma and COPD combined each year in the UK, 7,23 and more than two thirds of these patients are treated with antibiotics; therefore, being conservative regarding the effect size, a reduction in antibiotic duration of around 1 day per patient treated would equate to a total reduction of around 150 000 antibiotic days per year. This reduction would contribute substantially to the antimicrobial reduction targets set by National Health Service (NHS) organisations to address the threat of antimicrobial resistance. Although this trial is the first large randomised controlled trial of molecular POCT for respiratory viruses examining antibiotic use in detail, other smaller studies have suggested the potential of this strategy to reduce antibiotic use. 24 In addition to the changes in antibiotic use, our study shows that POCT might be associated with a reduction in hospital length of stay, and subgroup analyses suggest that this reduction was also principally in patients with exacerbation of airways disease. Again, our data suggest that this result was due to earlier discharge in patients testing positive for respiratory viruses in the POCT group. Notably, duration of hospitalisation in the COPD control group is consistent with that quoted in a large, contemporaneous UK study. 25 The reduction in length of stay for patients with exacerbation of airways disease was in the order of 1 day, which would equate to around 200 000 bed days saved per year across the NHS with an associated cost saving of around \u00a380 million per year (a formal health economic analysis of our trial will be published separately). 26 Routine POCT for respiratory viruses was also associated with an increased rate of detection of influenza cases and an improvement in antiviral use. Although only patients with clinically suspected infection were tested in the control group, the lower detection rate compared with the POCT group suggests that many cases of influenza were missed and remained undiagnosed in this group. This result is unsurprising as physician-diagnosed influenza is well known to be an insensitive method of case detection, even during periods of high influenza activity. 27, 28 In view of the potential consequences including nosocomial spread and the unrealised opportunity to benefit from neuraminidase inhibitor treatment in undiagnosed influenza, these data suggest that influenza testing should be routinely done in patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness during periods of influenza circulation. Neuraminidase inhibitor treatment is recommended by UK Public Health England for all patients hospitalised with influenza, 21 and although treatment is recommended irrespective of the duration of illness, neuraminidase inhibitors are likely to be most effective when administered earlier in the course of infection. 29 Our study shows that POCT for respiratory viruses leads to an increased proportion of influenza-positive patients correctly receiving treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors and suggests a reduced time to administration of the first dose. Additionally, most neuraminidase inhibitor use was directed towards influenza-positive patients in the POCT group, whereas most use was empirical in the control group and led to many influenza-negative patients receiving neuraminidase inhibitors unnecessarily. Neuraminidase inhibitor use in influenzaneg ative patients was also prolonged in the control group, presumably due to the long turnaround time of laboratory PCR compared with POCT. This unnecessary neuraminidase inhibitor use exposes patients to the sideeffects of neuraminidase inhibitors without any chance of associated benefit. The improvements in neuraminidase inhibitor use seen in this study are consistent with the findings of a previous non-randomised study 30 of hospitalised adults in which similar differences in the turn around time between rapid testing and laboratory PCR were also noted. Hospital side rooms, used for isolating potentially infectious patients, are a limited resource in most UK hospitals and, reassuringly, the use of POCT for respiratory viruses did not lead to an overall increase in side room use despite the increased detection rate of respiratory viruses. However, side room isolation for confirmed respiratory virus infection was more common in the POCT group than in the control group. This result reflects the high rate of directed use of side rooms for patients with confirmed influenza and other viruses compared with the empirical use of side rooms in the control group, many of whom subsequently tested negative and were de-isolated. POCT was also associated with other improvements in side room use including reduced time from admission to isolation with confirmed influenza and reduced time to de-isolation in patients isolated with suspected influenza but subsequently testing negative. Rapid and appropriate assignment of hospital side rooms for patients with respiratory virus infection is hugely important to reduce the risk of nosocomial transmission to other vulnerable hospitalised patients and to improve the flow of patients through acute areas within the hospital.",

A positive result can identify the need for isolation facility or neuraminidase inhibitor use in the case of influenza. Although the detection of a virus does not rule out the possibility of a bacterial infection or a benefit from antibiotics, a positive result might also allow the premature discontinuation of precautionary antibiotics in patients with exacerbation of airways disease, if not required on the basis of other criteria such as severity of illness. If negative, a POCT result can prevent or shorten the unnecessary use of isolation facilities and neuraminidase inhibitors.",

Therefore, the results of the POCT were not able to influence the primary outcome in a large proportion of patients. The a-priori secondary outcome measures of duration of antibiotic use and proportion of patients treated with single doses or brief courses of antibiotics are arguably more relevant to standard clinical management in this group-antibiotics are started very early in most patients with acute respiratory illness but might subsequently be continued or discontinued based on test results and clinical course. The post-hoc analysis of patients who had not yet been given antibiotics when POCT results were available arguably examines a slightly different population than does the primary outcome: patients in whom clinicians did not feel it necessary to start antibiotics very early on. However, the reduction in antibiotic use in the POCT group compared with the control group in this subgroup gives further credibility to the antibiotic reductions seen in the main study, and suggests that POCT at an even earlier point might reduce unnecessary antibiotic use further.",

Patients and those collecting data could have been blinded with the use of a sham swab; however, we felt that the risk of bias due to non-blinding was very low. Our findings should ideally be replicated in further studies before a definitive conclusion can be made. Because the study took place during winter months when respiratory virus infections are more common, the findings cannot be extrapolated outside of this period. In our trial, POCT was done by research staff rather than clinicians and so uncertainties remain about how such a test could be delivered routinely. Several models of delivery are potentially possible and include training clinicians or nursing staff to do the test (with the attendant consumption of their time) or the development of a POCT hub within acute areas, staffed by dedicated technicians and linked to a centralised laboratory.",
