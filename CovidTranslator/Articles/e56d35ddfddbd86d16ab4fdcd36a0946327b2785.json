            "text": "The radiolabeled isatin sulfonamide caspase-3 inhibitor, [ 18 F]2 (WC-II-89), is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis. The radiolabeling mechanism was studied by 13 C NMR, ESI/MS, and computational calculations. It was found that the high electrophilicity of the C3 carbonyl group in the isatin ring, which served as a trap for [ 18 F]fluoride, was responsible for the failure of the radiolabeling via nucleophilic substitution of the mesylate group in 7a by [ 18 F]fluoride. Once treated with a strong base, 7a opened the isatin ring completely to form an isatinate intermediate 16, which lost the ability to trap [ 18 F]fluoride, thereby allowing the displacement of the mesylate group to afford the 18 F-labeled isatinate 17. [ 18 F]17 can be converted to isatin [ 18 F]2 efficiently under acidic conditions. The ring-opening and re-closure of the isatin ring under basic and acidic conditions were confirmed by reversed phase HPLC analysis, ESI/MS and 13 C NMR studies. Computational studies of model compounds also support the above proposed mechanism. Similarly, the ring-opening and re-closure method was used successfully in the synthesis of the 11 C labeled isatin sulfonamide analogue [ 11 C]4 (WC-98). A microPET imaging study using [ 11 C]4 in the Fas liver apoptosis model demonstrated retained activity in the target organ (liver) of the treated mice. Increased caspase-3 activation in the liver was verified by the fluorometric caspase-3 enzyme assay. Therefore, this study provides a useful method for radiosynthesis of isatin derivative radiotracers for PET and SPECT studies, and [ 11 C]4 is a potential PET radiotracer for noninvasive imaging of apoptosis.",

One important application of molecular imaging is to study programmed cell death (apoptosis) at the molecular level. Apoptosis is critical for the normal development and function of multicellular organisms as a common and universal mechanism of cell death. 2 The abnormal regulation of cellular death via apoptosis is believed to play a key role in a variety of human diseases. 3 In addition, the beneficial effect of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and other antitumor therapies can be attributed to their activation of the apoptotic process. 4 Therefore, the development of a noninvasive imaging procedure that can study the process of apoptosis in a variety of disease states and monitor the ability of a drug or other treatment either to induce or to halt apoptosis would be of tremendous value to the research and clinical community.",

            "text": "One of the most commonly used agents so far for imaging apoptosis in vivo is based on Annexin V, which is a 36 kDa protein that binds selectively with high affinity to phosphatidylserine, a protein that is externalized in the early stages of apoptosis after the activation of caspase-3. Annexin V has been labeled with different radioisotopes for PET and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) studies. 5 99m Tc-labeled Annexin V using SPECT showed promising results and is undergoing clinical trials. 6 However, since the externalization of phosphatidylserine also occurs in necrosis, radiolabeled Annexin V is not specific for imaging apoptosis in vivo. An alternative strategy for visualizing cells and tissues undergoing apoptosis is the use of peptides or small molecules directed toward enzymes that are intrinsic to the biochemical pathways of apoptosis. The enzymes responsible for the regulation and execution of apoptosis are the caspases, which exist as inactive zymogens (pro-caspases) in the cytosol and become activated when cells receive an apoptotic signal. Caspases activated early in the process of apoptosis are known as initiator caspases, such as caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10. The function of the initiator caspases is to activate the executioner caspases, caspase-3, -6, and -7, which are responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of proteins that are necessary for cellular function. Cellular apoptosis can be initiated via two different pathways, extrinsic and intrinsic. 7 Since both pathways converge at the level of caspase-3 activation, immunohistochemical staining for activated caspase-3 provides an unambiguous marker for apoptosis.",

            "text": "The requisite radiolabeling reactions usually take place via the nucleophilic substitution of a good leaving group such as mesylate, tosylate or triflate under basic conditions for 18 F labeling 10 or methylation using [ 11 C]CH 3 I in the presence of a base for 11 C labeling. 11 These labeling reactions are very different from the normal chemical synthesis: the half lives of 18 F (t 1/2 = 110 min) and 11 C (t 1/2 = 20.4 min) are short, limiting the reaction time; therefore, fast reaction times and simple procedures are required. Secondly, only tracer amounts of radioactive isotopes, such as [ 18 F]fluoride and [ 11 C]CH 3 I, are present to react with a large excess of substrate. The labeling reaction can benefit from the large amount of substrate to increase the rate of the reaction, but at the same time, any amount of reactive impurities or other reactive functional groups in the substrate might react with [ 18 F]fluoride or [ 11 C]CH 3 I, generating side-products, or slowing down or even stopping the desired radiolabeling reaction. A variety of reactions can take place on the isatin ring in the isatin analogues. 12 One such reaction is the nucleophilic attack on the C3 carbonyl carbon of the isatin ring, the \"warhead group\" that is crucial to the inhibition of caspase-3 by isatin sulfonamide analogues. 13 Although isatin sulfonamide analogues exhibit very good potency for inhibiting caspase-3, the preparation of radiolabeled isatin sulfonamide analogues with 18 F or 11 C for PET imaging was limited because of the difficulty of radiolabeling with 18 F or 11 C using the standard methods. 14 In order to improve the synthesis of such compounds, we sought a better understanding of the radiolabeling reaction, and examined the mechanism through both experimental and modeling studies. Furthermore, related isatin derivatives have been reported as drug candidates for their inhibition of SARS Coronavirus 3C-like Protease, 15 GSK-3 protease, 16 carboxylesterases, 17 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. 18 They have also exhibited cytotoxicity to the cancer cells in vitro. 19 This study could provide a useful method to synthesize isatin derivative radiotracers for both PET and SPECT studies. Here we report the radiolabeling reactions of N-benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogues with 18 F and 11 C, the mechanism and modeling studies of the labeling reactions, and evaluation of the 11 C compound in an in vivo microPET imaging study with the Fas liver injury model in mice.",

Therefore, the isatin might exist in different forms in solution, such as the reversible hydrated form, 18, and the irreversible ring-opened form, 16, depending on the pH of the solution and the solvent used. Isatin-5-sulfonate itself was reported to exist as an isatin and a hydrated form in 3-4:1 ratio by NMR. 21 In aqueous solution, the hydrate form is suggested by HPLC peak fronting observed in reversed phase C18 HPLC chromatography using CH 3 CN and water (pH = 7 or 4) as solvents. The peak fronting should be due to the equilibrium of isatin and its more polar hydrated form, resulting from the interaction with water in the HPLC solvents. This peak fronting can be suppressed by addition of methanol to the HPLC solvent system. The formation of the hydrated form corroborates the high electrophilicity of the isatin ring at the C3 carbon.

The 13 C chemical shift of the C3 carbonyl carbon should be around 90 ppm for the hydrated form 18 and 200 ppm for the ring-opening form 16. 21 In DMSO, once precursor 7a was treated with 1 or 2 equivalent of 1 M Bu 4 NOH in water, a clean formation of the ring-opened product isatinate 16 was observed based on the observation that a new set of 13 C NMR peaks formed with the complete disappearance of those of 7a and that the chemical shift for C3 carbonyl carbon is shifted from 181.5 ppm for 7a to 200.6 ppm, which is the chemical shift expected for the ring-opened isatinate form 16. The 13 C NMR peaks (around 90 ppm) of the C3 carbonyl carbon for the hydrated form 18 were not observed. (For example, the C3 of 12 is at 93.3 ppm). Similarly, the C3 of Nbenzyl isatin 21, which was used for the modeling study, shifts from 183.1 ppm to 201.0 ppm in its ring-opened isatinate form 22 (supporting information Figure S7 -S14). Therefore, intermediate 18 is not likely to be involved in the labeling reaction and it should be the ringopened isatinate form 16 that is the species being labeled. We also attempted to study the formation of the fluoride adduct with 21 by 13 C and 19 F NMR. The 13 C NMR study of a reaction mixture, 21 and Bu 4 NF in DMSO, indicated the gradual formation of isatinate, and this should be due to the unavoidable OH \u2212 /H 2 O in Bu 4 NF solution. By comparison with a control reaction, in which no 21 was added, the signal-to-noise ratio in 19 F NMR of Bu 4 NF was reduced after addition of 21. This observation indicated that there is a fast exchange of fluoride with isatin and the observation supports our assumption that [ 18 F]fluoride is trapped by the isatin C3 carbonyl group instead of substituting the mesylate group during the 18 F labeling of 2 under standard conditions (supporting information Figure S5 -S6).",

The atom with the highest FF is highly reactive compared to the other atoms in the molecule. As confirmed by the theoretical calculations, the C3 carbon of the simplified precursor 21 has the highest electrophilicity (FF=0.24) in the molecule before the isatin ring opens; while its electrophilicity is lowered tremendously once it was converted into its isatinate form 22 (FF=0.04).

When only K 2 CO 3 was used in the labeling reaction, it was found that about 2 mg of K 2 CO 3 was needed in order to obtain high yield of the labeling product (Table 2, entry 4). When less than 1 mg of K 2 CO 3 was used, there was no incorporation after initial microwave irradiation, and only after more K 2 CO 3 /K 222 in DMSO was added, the yield increased to a comparable value as when 2 mg K 2 CO 3 used (table 1, entry 3). When [ 18 F]fluoride in the presence of K 222 and K 2 CO 3 was dried very carefully, the yield was low. This is understandable because K 2 CO 3 /K 222 is a weaker base than Bu 4 NOH and it doesn't provide OH \u2212 in the absence of water to open the isatin ring. Therefore, if K 2 CO 3 was used as a base in the labeling reaction, it needs a longer reaction time and a trace amount of H 2 O to open the isatin ring completely in order to avoid the trapping effect from the C3 carbonyl group. Normally, water should be excluded in the labeling reaction because water can solvate [ 18 F]fluoride, reducing its nucleophilicity, lowering its reactivity and resulting in the failure of the nucleophilic substitution. An example is when the isatin precursor was treated with wet Bu 4 NOH, a very low yield of labeling product was obtained (table 1, entry 2) in comparison to the precursor treated with dry Bu 4 NOH (table 1, entry 1). Therefore, the labeling reaction conditions were optimized by using a large amount of K 2 CO 3 to open the isatin ring completely, and to also consume trace amounts of water left during the drying of [ 18 Hydrolysis of isatin and N-methyl isatin and recyclization of isatinates have been studied, 24 but the study of other N-substituted isatins is quite limited. The stability of N-benzylisatins towards base hydrolysis is expected to be better than that of isatin or N-methyl isatin because of the steric protection from the benzyl substitute on the nitrogen atom in the isatin ring. This stability enables N-benzyl-isatinsulfonamide analogues to function as potential tracers for imaging caspases-3/7 activity in vivo. The hydrolysis of N-benzylisatinsulfonamides was studied by reversed phase HPLC and ESI/MS. According to HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture, Bu 4 NOH can hydrolyze isatin analogues to form isatinates exclusively and quickly; the hydrolysis by K 2 CO 3 /K 222 was quick, but the hydrolysis by NaHCO 3 /H 2 O was slow and in neutral solution the analogues were very stable. Once the isatinates were treated with 1N HCl, they were converted back to isatin analogues gradually at room temperature or quickly under heating or microwave irradiation. The base hydrolyzed isatin analogues and acid recyclized isatinates were purified by reversed phase HPLC and the HPLC purified products were further analyzed by ESI/MS. Molecular ion plus H 2 O was observed as the major peak for the hydrolyzed product in ESI/MS, together with the 13 C NMR study, indicating the formation of isatinate; The formation of isatin analogues from acid recyclization of isatinates was confirmed by comparison of the retention time in HPLC and MS spectrum with the corresponding isatin analogues (supporting information Figure  S3 , S4).",

Since [ 11 C]4 (WC-98) is a competitive inhibitor of caspase-3 and binds to the activated form of caspase-3 in tissues undergoing apoptosis, we see expected retention of the tracer in the liver of the treated mice. The results obtained with [ 18 F]4 suggest again that radiolabeled N-benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogues are potential radiotracers for imaging caspase-3 activity in vivo.",

            "text": "We have demonstrated that 11 C-and 18 F-labeled isatin analogues can be synthesized by using the base/acid ring-opening/recyclization procedure or by protecting the C-3 carbonyl group as a 1,3-dioxane. It was found that the high electrophilicity of the C-3 carbonyl group in the isatin ring served as a trap for [ 18 F]fluoride, resulting in the failure of 18 F radiolabeling under typical conditions. Therefore, the protection of the C-3 carbonyl carbon in isatin analogues is critical to avoid unwanted nucleophilic attacks during the synthesis, and the base/acid ring-opening/recyclization procedure was proved to be a highly efficient method for this purpose. Utilizing this method, we have synthesized 18 F and 11 C labeled isatin analogues with high chemical and radiochemical purities. In vivo evaluation of [ 11 C]4 (WC-98) in the Fas liver injury apoptosis model demonstrated increased uptake of the tracer in treated animals, with verification of caspase-3 activation by fluorometric caspase-3 enzymatic assay. The correlation of retaining tracer and caspase-3 enzyme activity in the liver of treated mice indicates that [ 11 C]4 (WC-98), a benzyl-isatin sulfonamide analogue caspase-3 inhibitor, is a potential radiotracer for imaging caspases3/7 activation in apoptosis. The method described in the paper should be applicable to the radiolabeling of other isatin analogues.",

Although the intermediate 20 is in equilibrium with 7a, the limiting amount of [ 18 F]fluoride (<10 \u22127 mol for 100 mCi [ 18 F]fluoride with specific activity of >1000 mCi/\u00b5mol) used in the labeling reaction is only one twentieth or even one hundredth of the amount of the precursor substrate used (1 mg, 2 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol) in the reaction. Therefore, the C3 carbonyl group in isatin analogues serves as a trap for [ 18 F]fluoride and results in the failure of the substitution of mesylate or tosylate groups by [ 18 F]fluoride. When the precursor 7a was treated with strong base (OH \u2212 ), either the ring opening form 16 or the hydrated intermediate 18 was formed completely so that the chance for [ 18 F]fluoride to be trapped by the isatin C-3 carbonyl group was eliminated. Under these conditions, [ 18 F]fluoride will substitute the mesylate group to give the radiolabeled product 17 or 19, which will be converted to [ 18 F]2 under acidic conditions.",

Under standard labeling conditions, the mesylate group was replaced with [ 18 F]fluoride via nucleophilic substitution to form the 18 F labeled intermediate 14 (table 1, entry 5), then 14 can be deprotected with 1 N HCl under microwave irradiation to afford [ 18 F]2.
