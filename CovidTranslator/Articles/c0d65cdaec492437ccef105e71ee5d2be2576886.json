            "text": "Objective: During a disease outbreak, media serve as primary transmitters of information from public health agencies to the public, and have been shown to influence both behavior and perception of risk. Differences in news frequency, framing and information source can impact the public's interpretation of risk messages and subsequent attitudes and behaviors about a particular threat. The media's framing of an outbreak is important, as it may affect both perception of risk and the ability to process important health information. Methods: To understand how risk communication by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the 2014 Ebola outbreak was framed and delivered and to what extent primetime broadcast news media mirrored CDC's framing and authoritative voice, 209 CDC communications and primetime broadcast transcripts issued between July 24 and December 29, 2014 were analyzed and coded by thematic frame and authoritative voice. Dominant frame and voice were determined for each month and for overall period of analysis. Results: Medical frame was dominant in CDC (60%), Anderson Cooper 360 (49%), The Rachel Maddow Show (47%) and All In with Chris Hayes (47%). The human interest frame was dominant in The Kelly File (45%), while The O'Reilly Factor coverage was equally split between sociopolitical and medical frames (28%, respectively). Primetime news media also changed dominant frames over time. Dominant authoritative voice in CDC communications was that of CDC officials, while primetime news dominantly featured local and federal (non-CDC) government officials and academic/medical experts. Conclusion: Differences in framing and delivery could have led the public to interpret risk in a different way than intended by CDC. Overall, public health agencies should consider adapting risk communication strategies to account for a dynamic news environment and the media's agenda. Options include adapting communications to short-form styles and embracing the concept of storytelling.",

For instance, general public distrust of the media for sensationalizing health stories may lead to a lower adoption rate of recommended behaviors, while uncertainty around specific outbreaks influence whether or not individuals undertake precautionary behaviors, with the public less likely to follow recommended behaviors in contexts of high uncertainty (Slovic, 1987; Wray et al., 2008) . Motivating the public to adopt recommended behaviors is challenging, and the public's response is typically characterized as one that makes decisions based on perception of risk, rather than actual risk (Rubin et al., 2009; Smith, 2006) .",

A frame is a central organizing idea used to suggest what is important within a particular topic or issue and affects audience attitudes and behaviors (Chong and Druckman, 2007; Gamson and Modigliani, 1989) . With roots in psychology and sociology, the concept of framing is based on the assumption that how an issue is characterized and defined can influence how audiences understand that issue (Kahneman and Tversky, 1984; Pan and Kosicki, 1993) . From a sociological perspective, Goffman (1974) argued that individuals cannot understand the world fully and struggle to interpret their life experiences and make sense of the world. As such, frames allow journalists to identify and classify information and, in turn, package information in an efficient way to relay such information to their audience; others have posited that media frames provide audiences with schemas for interpreting events (Entman, 1993; Gitlin, 1980) . In public health, how news and public health agency communications are framed may impact public interpretation of health information (Ungar, 1998) .",

These framing effects have been described through the associative network model of memory, which postulates that the human brain is a system made up of cognitive nodes and that certain aspects within a story will activate certain thoughts or feelings and nudge individuals to react in a particular manner Vincent Price et al., 1997) . In addition to information source, research has shown that Americans select their primary sources of news based on alignment with their own ideological orientation, and there is evidence that those that tend to have a more conservative ideology have greater sensitivity to fear and threats, which may, in turn, affect their interpretation of messaging (Iyengar and Hahn, 2009; Shook and Fazio, 2009) .",

When it comes to decision-making and behavior, mass media play a highly influential role (Luhmann and Cross, 2000) . The less personal experience an individual has with an issue, the larger the role that trust plays in the relationship between media and the user (Kohring and Matthes, 2007) . Trust in media is important as it facilitates media use and moderates the relationship between media users and content, thus allowing for direct media effects (Jackob, 2010; Tsfati and Cappella, 2003; Tsfati and Peri, 2006) .",

When a public health threat is portrayed as serious and relevant, individuals may experience fear, which may motivate them to take action to reduce this fear (Joffe, 2011; Witte and Allen, 2000) . Several theoretical models demonstrate that stress and high emotional arousal impact not only an individual's ability to process information, but also the way in which that information is processed (Covello et al., 2001; Sublet et al., 1996) . The mental noise model postulates that worry and stress generate internal \"mental noise,\" which inhibits the ability to process external information, while trust determination and negative dominance models assert that when individuals are upset, they often become distrustful of authority, are less likely to accept the validity of communications from a source of authority, and give greater weight to negative information over positive information (Baron et al., 2000; Covello et al., 2001; Glik, 2007; Renn and Levine, 1991; Sublet et al., 1996) . Published reflections on the Ebola outbreaks in the mid-1990s and the 2014 epidemic noted the importance of building trust and assuaging fear within the public as key strategies to combat rapid spread of disease, and the role of the media in creating or mitigating panic (Farrar and Piot, 2014; Joffe and Haarhoff, 2002; Towers et al., 2015) . Credibility of the information source has been positively associated with persuasiveness of increasing fear, suggesting that information source affects the level of fear an individual feels and in turn, can impact attitudes and behavior (Powell and Miller, 1967) .",

Risk perception is comprised, among other things, of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity (Slovic, 1987) . Differences in news frequency, framing and information source can impact risk perception and, as a result, subsequent attitudes and behaviors about a particular threat (Smith, 2006) . When a public health threat is portrayed as serious and relevant, individuals may experience fear, which may motivate them to take action to reduce this fear (Witte and Allen, 2000) .

Some suggest that the most important lesson learned from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic was the importance of effective public communication, as constant press coverage may have led to public overreaction and potentially affected perception of risk (Gatehouse, 2003; Hurst, n.d.; Lam et al., 2003; Smith, 2006) . During the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, mass media information shaped the way in which the public interpreted the severity and susceptibility to the virus, with the public overestimating the risk of infection (Poletti et al., 2011) . Previous research indicates that the public may feel more at ease when familiar risks are perceived to be under control; however, people desire more information to determine personal relevance when considering their response to unknown risks (Lion et al., 2002; Pidgeon et al., 2003; Poortinga et al., 2004) .",

Primetime is traditionally defined as 8pm to 11pm. Nielsen, a global company that manages the Nielsen television rating measurement system, states that more Americans watch television from 9:15pm to 9:30pm than any other period during primetime and that the end of the primetime period (10:45 to 11:00pm) is when the fewest number of viewers are watching (Nielsen, 2011) . As a result, this study chose to include only primetime broadcast news shows airing from 8pm to 9pm and 9pme10pm on each network; they included The O'Reilly Factor (Fox News), The Kelly File (Fox News), Anderson Cooper 360 (CNN), All In with Chris Hayes (MSNBC), and The Rachel Maddow Show (MSNBC).

Categories represent either explicit or inferred communication, and as there is no contact with the source being studied, is classified as a more unobtrusive method (Hsieh and Shannon, 2005) . The authors first randomly selected 25 articles (of 209 total articles, or 12%). Both authors reviewed all 25 articles using a content analysis approach and an initial coding key was developed collaboratively based on relevant frames used in this set of articles. The first author then coded this set of 25 articles. The second author reviewed the 25 articles coded by the first author to discuss and decide upon changes to the coding key. Both authors then coded a random selection of five of the 25 articles using the refined coding key. When disagreements arose, the authors referred to the code list definitions to come to an agreement and the code list was revised in an iterative fashion, and an additional randomly selected five articles of the original set of 25 articles were coded by both authors to finalize the coding key. Both authors then coded the entire set of 25 articles with the agreed upon final coding key. Inter-rater reliability of these 25 articles was satisfactory (k \u00bc 0.85). After this step, the first author then coded the remaining articles. After coding by the first author was complete, the second author reviewed a selected random sample of coded articles (approximately 10% of the articles) to verify themes. At this point in the analysis, as disagreements were few, articles were not recoded. Coded articles were recorded using Microsoft Excel (2013).",

A dynamic news environment is one in which there is a flow of multiple dimensions and various nuanced messages in news discourse, and an environment in which news is more contextualized, textured, and multi-dimensional than conceptualizations of traditional news media (Althaus and Kim, 2006; Fenton, 2010) . Technological, economic, and social changes have transformed the production of news, and the proliferation of news platforms has forced those that report on the news to question the idea that the public is a monolithic construct (Fenton, 2010) . As a result, framing of health risk messages may be transmitted and interpreted in unpredictable ways. This study found that the thematic framing and authoritative voice utilized by CDC is different than the framing and voice used by the primetime broadcast news media. Thus, it is possible that the public may have interpreted their risks to Ebola in a way that is different than what CDC intended. Additionally, there was variance in frames and voice over time within the primetime broadcast news media, which may have also influenced the ways in which the public interpreted their risk over time.",

The fact that coverage of Ebola was at times interwoven with coverage of other international news events may have implications for risk communications, as several theoretical models demonstrate that stress and high emotional arousal impact not only an individual's ability to process information, but also the way in which that information is processed (Covello and Peters, 1996; Glik, 2007) . If non-Ebola related news events are reported on during a news show in the same segment as Ebola-related news, and elicit an emotional response from viewers, it is possible that this could impact viewers' ability to process Ebola-related risk information.",

Regarding public interpretation of health risk messaging, The O'Reilly Factor frequently aired video clips of President Obama speaking about the Ebola crisis, which were followed by O'Reilly's personal commentary or by guest commentary and generate an interesting question about how information is ultimately received. If President Obama speaks through a medical frame, and Bill O'Reilly translates that information through a socio-political frame, how is the public's interpretation affected, if at all? This idea of multi-level message transmission and its effect on thematic framing is a research area to further explore. Additionally, research indicates that Americans select their primary sources of news based on alignment with their own ideological orientation (Iyengar and Hahn, 2009) . During a public health crisis, the impact of ideological leaning on news preferences can alter how public health information is framed and potentially comprehended (Hallahan, 1999) . During the Ebola crisis, some patterns in frequency, framing and use of authoritative voice during evening primetime news emerged across ideological lines, and specifically between moderate liberal and conservative news sources and extreme liberal and conservative news sources. Thus, it is possible that moderate liberals and conservatives and extreme liberals and conservatives may share preferences for how information is delivered during a public health crisis. Further research is recommended to explore this pattern.",

This study's findings indicate that primetime broadcast news shows change the dominant thematic frames and authoritative voices featured in their reporting over time, effectively mimicking a story narrative, which is consistent with agenda-setting theory: The media frames information in \"compelling arguments\" (McCombs, 2013; Sheafer, 2007) . By mirroring the media's approach, and purposefully employing new dominant thematic frames and authoritative voices in their risk communications, public health agencies may appeal to both the public's and the media's desire for a compelling storyline, which may positively impact their ability to get critical information included in the media's coverage (McCombs, 2013; Nobles and Schiff, 2004; Sheafer, 2007) .",

As a result, results are not generalizable across all television media outlets and programs, are not representative of morning news shows, and do not include print, radio, or new media. Additionally, framing is influenced by a variety of externalities, which this study was not able to account for in its analysis. Finally, it is unknown how the public interpreted CDC or media messaging, and future research should address this gap. Despite these limitations, this study suggests that public health agencies should take into consideration how the media frames and delivers information related to public health crises, and should respond accordingly to ensure that their risk communications are accurate, relevant, and influence the public to take the correct protective action.",
