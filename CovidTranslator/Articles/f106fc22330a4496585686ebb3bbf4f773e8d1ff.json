Circulating monocytes are essential for the innate responses and subsequent acquired immune responses to Streptococcus pneumoniae. In this study, we investigated the effects of PspA on cytokine and chemokine secretion from human peripheral blood monocytes and the underlying intracellular signaling mechanisms. Stimulation of monocytes with purified PspA protein induced the significant release of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and chemokines including CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5. Products from PspA-deficient mutant pneumococcus that did not express PspA induced significantly less secretion of these mediators than those from wild type pneumococcus. Further investigations showed that PspA activated the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-kB signaling pathways in human monocytes. Moreover, inhibition of these pathways using selective inhibitors could significantly reduce the cytokine and chemokine secretion induced by PspA. Taken together, our findings provide insight for PspA-mediated activation of human monocytes via NF-kB and MAPKs signaling cascades in the pathogenesis of invasive pneumococcal infection.",

WHO estimates that invasive pneumococcal infection results in an estimated 1.6 million deaths every year [2] . Thus pneumococcal diseases remain to be a major global-health issue. For many years, it is well known that antiphagocytic polysaccharide capsule is the most important virulence factor of S. pneumoniae [3] . Over the past 20 years, the importance of pneumococcal proteins for the virulence of S. pneumoniae has been clarified, either as mediators of inflammation or by directly attacking host tissues [3, 4] . Pneumococcus has a significant attenuation of virulence by mutation of the genes encoding pneumococcal virulence proteins [3] . Therefore, pneumococcal virulence proteins play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of pneumococcal infections. And a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between pneumococcal virulence proteins and host cells may be helpful for the development of novel therapeutic agents against pneumococcal infections.",

            "text": "Pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) was first identified by using monoclonal antibodies raised against surface determinants of S. pneumoniae [5] . PspA is a choline-binding surface protein, and it is composed of five domains: a signal peptide, an a-helical domain, a proline-rich region, a choline-binding domain, and a Cterminal tail [6] . PspA is presented on the surface of all pneumococcus, but it is highly variable. Based on the sequences of the N-terminal, PspA can be grouped into three families and can be further subdivided into six different clades [7] . PspA is a lactoferrin-binding protein and S. pneumoniae may overcome the iron limitation through lactoferrin-PspA interaction [8] , it can also reduce the amount of C3b deposited onto pneumococcus and antibodies to PspA could increase complement activation and C3 deposition [9] . Shaper M et al demonstrated that PspA could protect S. pneumoniae from killing by apolactoferrin and anti-PspA antibodies could enhance killing of pneumococcus by apolactoferrin [8] . A recent study indicated that PspA contributed to secondary S. pneumoniae infection after influenza virus infection [10] . PspA has a great potential to be an effective vaccine candidate and systemic or mucosal immunization with PspA could elicit effective protection against pneumococccal infections [5, 11] . The capacity of PspA to protect against pneumococcal diseases remains to be determined but will have important implications for pneumococcal vaccine development.",

Upon pneumococcus's entry into the bloodstream, invasive pneumococcal infection is likely regulated through contact with naive monocytes, resulting in the activation of monocytes and an inflammatory response and the final opsonindependent phagocytosis [1, 3] .

However, PspA could not activate human monocytes to secrete TNF-a, IL-1b and CCL3. The explanation may be that PspA can not activate their gene transcriptions and selectively regulate the induction of different cytokines and chemokines by activation of different transcription factors. Although CCS containing a variety of native components released from PspAdeficient mutant pneumococcus that did not express PspA could induce significantly more secretion of these mediators than that of control medium, the secretion of these mediators was significantly less than that of CCS from wild type pneumococcus. Since CCS from PspA-deficient mutant pneumococcus was absent of full or truncated PspA confirmed by Western blot, we can conclude that native PspA of pneumococcus is an inducer of IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5. In addition, given the known polymorphic variation in PspA between different pneumococcal strains, further studies are required to explore the impact of such differences on the secretion of IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5.",

Since IL-17A was shown to increase pneumococcal killing by human neutrophils [21] , IL-6 may therefore play an important role in mediating pneumococcal immunity in humans. Among chemokines induced by PspA, CCL2 is a chemoattractant for monocytes. Beside, CCL2 can also induce the release of lysosomal enzymes, production of superoxide anions and expression of cytokines and chemokines from macrophage [22] .",

The signal transduction cascades are finely tuned, and they control gene expressions via phosphorylation of various protein kinases and target proteins upon various extracellular stimulations [25] . To investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms, we examined the role of NF-kB and MAPKs pathways using a pharmacological approach. PspA-induced secretion of IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4 and CCL5 was significantly decreased by IkBa and MAP kinase inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of these pathways in pneumococcal inflammatory diseases. However, either inhibition of ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK or NF-kB pathways could partially diminish the induced secretion of these mediators by PspA. These results indicated that all the three MAPK pathways and NF-kB pathway were partly but not predominantly involved in this induction. Furthermore, differential activation of other different intracellular signaling mechanisms and/or differential regulation of various transcription factors for the secretion of cytokines and chemokines in human monocytes cannot be excluded and require further investigation.",

NF-kB-and MAPKsdependent chemokine synthesis in human antigen-presented dendritic cells in response to pneumococcal proteins pneumolysin and choline binding protein A (CbpA) has also been reported [26] . Therefore, the activated NF-kB and MAPKs signaling pathways are involved in pneumococcal infection. In fact, enhanced phospho-p38 MAPK expression in mononuclear cells has been investigated in severe acute respiratory syndrome [27] .

Esterase A (EstA) of pneumococcus is an inducer of NO and TNF-a, IL-1b and IL-6 mRNA in RAW 264.7 macrophages [30] . Ferreira et al recently reported that PspA is a novel inducer of IL-17 and IFN-g, two important cytokines which are involved in protection effects against pneumococcal infection [11] . However, this is the first study shown that PspA could stimulate the release of IL-6, CXCL8, CCL2, CCL4, and CCL5 from human peripheral blood monocytes via intracellular NF-kB and MAPKs signaling pathways. It is suggested that pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines differentially regulate an in vivo humoral response to S. pneumoniae [3] . In fact, a complex series of interactions among immune, epithelial and vascular system cells, as well as pneumococcal virulence factors seems to be responsible for the outcome of invasive pneumococcal infection. As one of the most important virulence factors of pneumococcus, this study on PspA provides new insight for PspA-mediated activation of monocytes via differential intracellular signaling cascades in pneumococcal infection, and the work for identifying potential recognition receptor of PspA on human monocytes is ongoing. Our present findings may also have important implications in the development of effective vaccines or other therapeutic agents against pneumococcal infection.",
