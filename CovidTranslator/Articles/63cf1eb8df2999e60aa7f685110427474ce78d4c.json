These models aim to estimate the dynamics of cholera transmission and the impact of possible interventions, with a goal of providing guidance to policymakers in deciding among alternative courses of action, including vaccination, provision of clean water, and antibiotics. Here we discuss concerns about model misspecification, parameter uncertainty, and spatial heterogeneity intrinsic to models for cholera. We argue for caution in interpreting quantitative predictions, particularly predictions of the effectiveness of interventions. We specify sensitivity analyses that would be necessary to improve confidence in model-based quantitative prediction, and suggest types of monitoring in future epidemic settings that would improve analysis and prediction.",

The extent of these disasters has prompted inquiries into whether interventions -such as vaccination, antibiotic administration, and the provision of clean water -could have slowed or aborted these cholera epidemics, and how such interventions might be most effectively implemented in future epidemics. Cholera spreads in areas with poor sanitation and through contaminated water, and the ideal solution is to improve infrastructure to provide clean water and effective sanitation --an approach that has been successful since the 19 th century. 1 On the timescale of an epidemic, creation of such infrastructure is rarely feasible.

Toward this end, several recent models based on data from the cholera epidemics in Haiti and Zimbabwe have been published. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] All models are limited by their simplifying assumptions. It is important to critically evaluate cholera models and their assumptions, so as to gauge the strength of their conclusions. Here, we examine the assumptions implicit in mathematical models of cholera, and the ways these models have been applied to data from Haiti and Zimbabwe. We discuss the impact of model misspecification, parameter uncertainty, and spatial heterogeneity, and explore specifically the impact of the unknown lifespan of cholera vibrios in water reservoirs. We discuss why these criticisms --potentially applicable to many infectious disease modeling efforts --are particularly germane to cholera models. Our goal is neither to compare models directly nor to critique each model individually, but to explore the general issues that confront cholera modeling efforts.",

For these respiratory diseases, a common approach has been to estimate the early growth rate from daily or aggregated case counts, combine this estimate with a (usually exogenous) estimate of the distribution of serial intervals, and produce an estimate of the early values of the reproductive number of the infection. Relatively high-quality estimates of the serial interval distribution were available from contact tracing for SARS, leading to rather consistent estimates of the initial reproductive number around 3. [42] [43] [44] Likewise, several sources of data provide estimates for the serial interval of pandemic influenza around 2-4 days, 45, 46 with corresponding estimates of early reproductive numbers ranging from around 1.3 to a bit over 2, depending on the pandemic and the setting. [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] While these estimates vary (reflecting true variation, methodological choices, and statistical noise), the range of variation in estimates is less than described above for epidemic cholera. The influenza literature contains explicit considerations of the appropriate values for natural-history parameters 45, 50, 51 (including critiques 45 of previously used values 48 ), discussions of the impact of data processing assumptions on reproductive number estimates, 35, 49 and extensive sensitivity analyses exploring the consequences of alternative parameter values. [52] [53] [54] Moving beyond parameter-value uncertainty to issues of model structure, the literature on respiratory diseases has considered how varying assumptions about the scale and \"localness\" of mixing, 55,56 the relative importance of various settings for transmission, 54 seasonality, 57 and other factors affect the predicted natural history of an epidemic and impact of control measures. The importance of heterogeneity is recognized in modeling many diseases. [58] [59] [60] [61] In summary, the issues raised here about the reliability of quantitative predictions from cholera models are applicable to other diseases, including those for which real-time (and retrospective) model fitting has been attempted, such as influenza and SARS. In these diseases, as well, sensitivity analyses to uncertain or heterogeneous parameters are needed, and have indeed been employed. 42, 62, 63 However, there appears to be less heterogeneity and less uncertainty about parameter values for these diseases, perhaps because of their direct person-to-person transmission route, which reduces the impact of environmental variables on parameter values and improves one's ability to measure relevant quantities. Thus, while the same issues should be considered in other diseases, we believe the magnitude of uncertainty in the predictions of models is greater for cholera than for SARS and influenza.",

These quantitative results about the impact of interventions depend on the parameter values used in the model. In this sense (setting aside issues of model specification), the value of model-based predictions depends on the extent to which the predictions about indirect effects are robust to uncertainties about the value of input parameters. Uncertainties in the values of input parameters can translate into massive uncertainties in the values of model predictions. We present an example in the Figure (see eAppendix [http://links.lww.com] for details)",

Fitting the model with the lifespan of infectious vibrios set at 30 and then at 3 days changes the fitted R 0 from 6 to 1.95, while the critical vaccination threshold decreases from 83% to 49%. Let us assume pre-epidemic vaccination of 70% of the population with a non-leaky vaccine that has 70% efficacy (in keeping with estimates for populations with less natural immunity than the endemic populations in which the vaccine was trialed37 ). If R 0 = 1.95, then pre-vaccination of a population would prevent an epidemic, whereas if R 0 = 6, then nearly all unvaccinated persons will become infected. Thus, usingparameter values found in the literature, the indirect benefits of vaccination (which is what the model is meant to quantify) range from almost complete protection of all unvaccinated persons to no protection.
