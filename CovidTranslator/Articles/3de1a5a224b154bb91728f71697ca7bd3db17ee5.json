The phylogenetic reconstruction was based on a dataset representative of all known lyssaviruses, including the recently described IKOV. The topology obtained showed that this sequence is more closely related to IKOV and WCBV than to the lyssaviruses in phylogroups I and II (Figure) . These results suggest that this sequence tentatively belongs to a new Lyssavirus species named after the location of collection, Lleida bat lyssavirus (LLEBV). The highest nucleotide identity was with IKOV (71. 7%-64%) . The lowest nucleotide identity was with the only lyssavirus found in bats of the Iberian Peninsula, EBLV-1. The nucleotide identity among the previously known lyssaviruses was 63.5%-80.0% in this particular fragment, and the lowest identities among strains belonging to the same lyssavirus were 80.4% for ABLV and 79.9% for LBV (the most distant LBV strain has been suggested to be a different lyssavirus) (online Technical Appendix, wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/19/5/12-1071-Techapp1.pdf).",

However, recent molecular analyses have confirmed that the genus Miniopterus belongs to the family Miniopteridae (12) . M. schreibersii bats are migratory, widely distributed across southern Europe and Eurasia. Large numbers (thousands) of these bats overwinter in caves and move in the spring to different and sometimes distant summer roosts for reproduction (13) . These ecologic features make it relatively easy for an infectious agent to quickly spread out within and among the populations.",
