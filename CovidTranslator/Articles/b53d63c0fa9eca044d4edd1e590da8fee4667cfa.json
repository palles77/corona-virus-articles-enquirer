This is why most of us have limited personal experience with such events. The present outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans that is causing a major epidemic in the last 2 decades. 1 Recent outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012 were successfully confined to small regions of the planet. As such, they were of peripheral concern to allergists practicing in the United States because we and our patients were not exposed to them. Now that COVID-19 is affecting us and our patients directly, concerns about this novel emerging infection have gone, well. viral. It was only a matter of time until a global pandemic affected us, and our time has run out.",

COVID-19 is proving to be more infectious than severe acute respiratory syndrome, leading to 10 times as many cases in one-quarter of the time. 1 A significant portion of cases in China were due to hospital-related transmission, 2 and skilled nursing facilities in Washington state have followed suit. Without proper containment measures, the fear is that hospitals will be overrun with COVID-19 cases. Not only does this limit our ability to treat seriously ill patients infected with the virus but it also could prevent uninfected individuals suffering from more mundane life-threatening conditions, such as myocardial infarction and stroke, from receiving timely treatment that they would routinely get in \"normal\" times.",

After all, the only infection that one can catch while using TM is a computer virus. To encourage the TM approach, nearly all health plans and large employers offer some form of coverage for TM services. Although the use of TM has increased over the last 2 to 3 years, rates of TM adoption among allergists are still low. 3 In response to the current COVID-19 situation, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and commercial health plans largely have waived co-pays for TM visits as a means to encourage utilization in this time of need, and allergists need to pay attention to this. 4, 5 A recent survey demonstrated that patients are willing to use telehealth, but barriers still exist, namely: (1) At a time of need, many people revert to what they are used to doing and the way in which they previously interacted with the health care system. (2) Patients would prefer that they see their own provider through TM versus someone with whom they do not have a previously established relationship. (3) Patients may be unaware that they have TM as an option and do not know how to access it. 6 Health plans, employers, hospital systems, and media outlets should work to overcome these barriers by (1) educating people that TM is an effective alternative and safer under the current circumstances, (2) expanding network reimbursement coverage for physicians to see their patients through TM, (3) making people aware that a TM benefit exists, with step-by-step instructions on how it can be accessed, (4) helping people understand how TM works, and (5) continuing to reduce cost barriers to accessing TM.",

Individuals with these conditions are particularly susceptible to COVID-19, and medication compliance and disease optimization are important ways to mitigate severity. TM can serve as a safe and effective alternative to in-person care. Recent studies have demonstrated similar health outcomes for patients whether delivered in person or synchronously by a remote provider for various conditions including asthma. 12 A 2015 Cochrane systematic review examined the impact of telehealth involving remote monitoring or videoconferencing compared with in-person or telephone visits for chronic conditions including diabetes and congestive heart failure. This review found similar health outcomes for patients with these conditions. 13 So, although the presence of a pandemic is an unfortunate, though inevitable occurrence, it is also an opportunity to set up an infrastructure for providing care using TM. Once the current pandemic is over, TM can continue to be used to provide more convenient, cost-effective care to patients. In this way, we will already be prepared for the next, inevitable, infectious disease to emerge.",
