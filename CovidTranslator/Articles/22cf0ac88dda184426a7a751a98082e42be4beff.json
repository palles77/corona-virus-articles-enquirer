Virus particles from Beaudette were the same size and shape as Connecticut and Massachusetts : all the strains had overall diameters ranging from 80 to 110 nm. Virus particles in most preparations contained only partial coronas of surface projections and in a few eases almost no surface projections, although in no ease did the virus particles contain complete coronas. We only used virus particles that contained partial coronas as they occurred more frequently and appeared more typical of eoronaviruses generally. The virus particles with no coronas will be discussed in a later paper. Virus Polypeptide Analysis Figure 2 shows the polsTeptides of the purified major virus species of the IBV strains Beaudette, Connecticut and Massachusetts, on polyaerylamide gels. Seven polypeptides, VP 1 to VP 7, were observed in each of the strains. I{owever, polypeptides VPzi and VP5 could not in all cases be clearly distinguished. The proportions of these polypeptides were similar, apart from the proportion of VP6 which varied considerably in the 3 strains. There was more VP6 in Massachusetts (Fig. 2C) and Connecticut (Fig. 2B ) than in Beaudette ( Fig. 2A) . Figure 3 shows a comparison between the polypeptides of the major (Fig. 3A ) and high density (Fig. 3B) virus species of Massachusetts. The polypeptide profiles were similar except that there was considerably more VP6 in the major species than in the high density species. Similar results have been obtained with Beaudette and Comleetieut. The approximate molecular weights of the virus polypeptides have been determined by comparison with the relative mobilities of bovine serum albumin (dimer and monomer), ovalbumin, trypsin and lysozyme. Table 2 shows the molecular weights of the viral polypeptides determined from 10 experiments. Previous papers on the pol~peptide composition of IBV have shown the presence of I4 to 16 polypeptides in the virus particles (2, 3). When we prepared virus polypeptides for eleetrophoresis using 2 per cent dithiothreitol to reduce the polypeptides (3) or by boiling the polypeptides before and after overnight dialysis (2), we obtained polypeptide patterns similar to those leported previously (2, 3) . Figure 4 shows a profile of IBV Beaudette polypeptides prepared using our modified preparative procedure involving boiling of the polypeptides after overnight dialysis (see Methods). ~!dthough the pattern varied from experiment to experiment, at least 12 polypeptides were seen compared with the 7 polypeptides observed using our standard procedure (Fig. 2 A) . The new polypep~ides have been designated VPA, VPB, VPC, VPD and VPE and have molecular weights of approximately 56,000, 45,000, 38,000, 21,000 and 19,000 respectively. However, in all cases the proportions of the new polypeptides increased with more degradation of the polypeptides VP 1 to VP 7. There was essentially no difference between the polypepgide profiles of the major and high density virus species.",

As mentioned above, the Beaudette strain is serologically similar to Massachusetts from which it has been derived by multiple passages in embryonated chicken eggs.
