The immune response was found to be distinct for each of the infection scenarios and we uncovered that the immune response during the co-infection has three phases and two transition points. During the first phase, its dynamics is inherited from its response to the primary (viral) infection. The immune response has an early shift (few hours post coinfection) and then modulates its response to react against the secondary (bacterial) infection. Between 18 and 26 h post co-infection the nature of the immune response changes again and does no longer resembles either of the single infection scenarios.",

It generates a simple description of the data in the form of a combinatorial object called a simplicial complex , that captures topological and geometric information of the point cloud in high dimensional space. The algorithm uses a (combination of) function(s) that map the data to a metric space, and builds an informative representation based on the clustering of subsets (which are associated to the values of the function(s)) of the data set. In the simplest case, this method reduces high dimensional data sets to a network whose nodes correspond to clusters in the data and edges to the existence of points in common between clusters. The aim of this algorithm is not to obtain a fully accurate representation of a data set, but rather a low-dimensional image which can highlight areas of interest, possibly for further analysis and quantification.",

Topological data analysis and nearest neighbour analysis reveal that initially the immune system inherits its behaviour from its response to the primary infection; it goes through a swift transition early in the co-infection (i.e. soon after the onset of the secondary infection) and it is consequently and temporarily driven mainly by its response to the secondary infection. There is a second transition point in the behaviour of the immune system and from there, it no longer resembles a standard response associated to either of the two single infections, but rather it shapes its behaviour to respond to the co-infection itself. 2 .

In [15] , where looping was indeed found to be a motif in their data set (of an infection from which patients can recover, such as in our study), the cosine metric was used, so we also decided to test this metric.

We want to cluster points whose vectors from the origin are almost parallel and point almost in the same direction. Two such points have a normalised dot product value that is close to + 1. However, DBSCAN clusters two points whenever they are a distance less than or equal to the eps parameter. (The eps parameter is the maximum distance between two samples for them to be considered as in the same neighbourhood). Therefore, what we need is a distance formula that outputs small values for points that are \"close\" to each other (i.e. whose vectors from the origin point in roughly the same direction). The above bespoke distance formula achieves this. In order to implement this computationally, we precompute the distance matrix of the data using the normalised dot product with the sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity function of sklearn, next, we preprocess the distance matrix such that it fits our bespoke distance criterion: X_cosine_similarity = sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity(X) X_dist = np.abs(X_cosine_similarity -1) Finally, we pass the precomputed distance matrix to the clusterer, setting the metric parameter of DBSCAN to be equal to 'precomputed'.",

Thus, choosing a higher number of intervals translates to increasing the number of vertices of the graph. Increasing the percentage overlap allows the algorithm to find more data points in common between two intervals, thus roughly translating to an increased possibility of connecting two vertices.

Next, we chose simplicial complexes that had number of vertices at least half of the number of data points in the data set (for example, if the data set for the IAV infection group has 30 data points then we favour simplicial complexes that consist of only one connected component and at least 15 vertices); choosing this number gives a good resolution, not too simple, but also prevents the user from choosing simplicial complexes that have oversampling of data points. Finally, we visually inspected the simplest (in terms of small values for the parameters) 10, 20 or 30 simplicial complexes in that list.

For the T4 and AIV + T4 infection groups, at 18 hpi and 18 hpc, respectively, the measurements had to be repeated. As it is a cross-sectional study (each measurement is coming from a mouse), to impute corresponding values, we allocate high values of bacterial burden to rows that contain high values of cytokines. Since mice were naive, we replaced any Three types of parameters are needed to generate a topological model: First is a notion of similarity, called a metric, which measures the distance between two points in some space (in our case, the points are the rows in the data and the space is a multidimensional space that can be plotted using the quantitative measurements of disease symptoms as axes, such as the pathogen load or cytokine concentration, i.e. the features of the data set). The metric we used is the correlation distance. Second are lenses, which are functions that describe the distribution of data in a space. A lens is a mathematical mapping (function) that converts a data set into a vector, in which each row in the original data set contributes to a real number in the vector; i.e. a lens operation turns every row into a single number. Metrics are used with lenses to construct the simplicial complex output. Multiple lenses can be used in each analysis. In this case, Keppler-Mapper handles them mathematically by considering the Cartesian product. Third is the resolution, which controls the number of bin partitions that will be created within the range of selected lens values, known as the number of intervals, and the amount of oversampling between bins, known as the percentage overlap. Clustering then takes place within the bins, forming the final vertices of the simplicial complex; and clusters are connected with an edge whenever they share data points within the region that are over-sampled according to the percentage overlap. Therefore increasing the number of bins increases the number of vertices and increasing the percentage overlap results in an increased number of edges. The metric, lenses, resolution, and clusterer used to generate the topological graphs in Figs. 5 and 6 are as indicated in Table 1 . K-Nearest Neighbour Analysis was implemented using the KNeighborsClassifier from the Scikit Learn Python library [29] , with the correlation metric. T-tests were done using the ttest_ind function from the SciPy Python library.

This methodology was applied in [15] to investigate malaria. Motivated from this approach, we investigated if looping curves are a common motif in influenza or influenza in co-infection with bacteria.

The Kepler Mapper [25] , a library implementing the mapper algorithm in Python, was employed. Additionally, we wrote a semi-unsupervised algorithm that built all simplicial complexes for various metrics, lenses and ranges of values for the lens intervals and percentage overlap, and which chose simplicial complexes to represent the data. More specifically, using our semi-unsupervised algorithm, we tested the cosine, euclidean and correlation metrics, along with different epsilon values for the clusterer. Furthermore, all analysis was done using two lenses and we tested different combinations of the following: projections to the features of the data sets (i.e. the values of the pathogen load or the concentrations of the cytokines), the distance to the two nearest neighbours, the first two dimensions of various linear and non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms and projections to (the image of) functions that reveal interesting geometric and statistical information about the data, such as density, eccentricity or centrality. We tested between 2 and 30 intervals for each lens and 10 different values for the percentage overlap of the lens' intervals and the epsilon parameter of the clusterer. This resulted in almost 1 billion simplicial complexes being generated, from which, using properties of graphs such as the number of connected components, the algorithm chose complexes that were persistent in shape and that showcased important information about the immune response.",

In other words, the Mapper Algorithm has segregated those specific points (26hpc and 31hpc in the co-infection) away from all other points, indicating that the data behaves differently at and after 26hpc in the co-infection scenario, compared to the other points. This, we interpret as the immune system undergoing a shift in its behaviour in the co-infection, sometime between 18 and 26 h post co-infection. From this observation we conclude that the topological data analysis has highlighted a transition in the nature of the immune response during a co-infection sometime between 18 and 26 hours post coinfection.",

The p-values show that, in the co-infection scenario, there is a strong change in the concentration of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1 and IL-6 (as well as in the viral load) between 18 and 26 hpc. The boxplots clearly revealed that data points of IAV + T4 from 26 and 31 h post co-infection are separated by the simplicial complex from the earlier data points and that 18 and 26 hpc represent a transition point for the system, since at both time points there are data subsets that belong to both groups in the simplicial complex (the yellow and the teal/purple). It is possible that the shape of the simplicial complexes in Fig. 5 is exactly mirrowing the dramatic change in the concentration of the cytokines (and possibly the viral load) that is revealed by the p -values. Fig. 8 A shows the k-nearest neighbours for the data sets in the three infection groups, with metric correlation and 30 neighbours. The rows and columns indicate each data points and dark regions indicate the 30 closest neighbours of each data point. The labels show which points belong to which infection group and time point. The bottom right panel, inside the orange dotted box, corresponds specifically to the data points of the co-infection group (IAV + T4). The data sets in this region can be divided into three groups: the early period (1.5 hpc), the transition period (6 hpc) and the later period (between 18 and 31 hpc). This is illustrated by the fact that within the orange dotted box, the data sets at 1.5 hpc are neighbours with only data sets at 1.5 and 6.0 hpc, the data sets in 6 hcp have neighbours in both the early and the later groups and data sets at 18, 26 and 31 hpc have neighbours only at 6 hpc and late time points. This can be seen more clearly in Fig. 8 B which shows the correlation coefficients between data points in the co-infection data set. Data sets at 1.5 hpc are closely correlated to themselves, data sets at 6 hpc have close correlation to points in both the early and later periods, the later data sets (18, 26 and 31 hpc) are closely correlated to themselves only. Data sets between the early and later groups are not correlated. In Fig. 8 A, now looking at the neighbours of the co-infection data subsets outside of the orange dotted box and inside the green dotted boxes (i.e. along the rows), we can see that co-infection data sets at early times also have neighbours exclusively in the IAV single infection group and co-infection data sets at late times also have neighbours exclusively in the T4 single infection group. In other words, the early co-infection data sets are closely correlated with the data sets in the IAV single infection group and the late co-infection data sets are closely correlated with the data sets in the T4 single infection group. Putting these three observations together, we can conclude that the immune response in the co-infection inherits its early response from the primary viral infection but at 6 hpc it undergoes a shift and quickly shapes its response to defend against the secondary bacterial infection.",

We call this phase 1 of the immune response. Subsequently, the system undergoes an abrupt transition at 6 hours post onset of the secondary bacterial infection as it quickly modulates itself and starts responding predominantly to the bacterial infection; this is phase 2 of the immune response. There is a second transition stage between 18 and 26 h post co-infection after which the immune response does no longer resemble the behaviour under a single viral or bacterial infection, but presumably shapes its response to the co-infection itself; this stage we call phase 3.",

We observe that the simplicial complexes generated by the mapper algorithm with a projection to the features could be representing exactly those dramatic changes in the values of the features and that the algorithm is able to separate data points with high relative concentrations of cytokines away from other data points. In the simplicial complexes illustrated in Fig. 6 in both the T4 and IAV + T4 infection groups the simplicial complexes generated with the TNF-\u03b1 projection draw attention to the later time points in both infection scenarios. Specifically, for T4, the data sets correspond to time 26 and in IAV + T4 the data correspond to times 26 and 31. We could further interpret these results as further supporting evidence that the immune response at this stage of the co-infection is primarily responding in a way that is similar to its response in the single bacterial infection.",

Recall that the vertices of the simplicial complex represent clusters of points of the data set and edges between vertices indicate that there are data in common between clusters. Therefore, after further analysis of the data sets that are in common between the purple and yellow vertices (clusters) and teal and yellow vertices, we could elucidate that, in fact, the purple vertices have data sets exclusively in the single viral infection at early time points and vertices in teal have all the data sets in the single bacterial infection and some data sets in the late stages of the single viral infection. In other words, the yellow region emanating from the purple vertices is connected exclusively to early time points in the single viral infection and the other yellow region to the single bacterial infection and late time points in the viral infection.",

It is to be expected that a topological approach to study infectious diseases where hosts recover would also reveal circular topological simplicial complexes. This is not the case for the data set we have used. For the three infection groups, the data sets do not contain information for the full course of the infections. More specifically, the data set of the single IAV infected group is based on data starting from day 7 post the onset of the viral infection. The data set for the co-infected groups is incomplete towards the end of the infection course because for ethical reasons the mice that developed a high morbidity had to be euthanized before the bacterial infection is resolved naturally.

This seems indeed to be the case as explained earlier in this discussion. However, for example, striking changes in bacterial burden and viral load in the co-infection are shown in Table 2 , where the bacterial burden changes significantly between 1.5 and 6 hpc and between 6 and 18 hpc and the viral load changes significantly between 18 and 26 hpc. In this case, it is not clear exactly how these changes are represented in the simplicial complexes of Fig. 6 .

Topological data analysis and nearest neighbour analysis reveal that initially the immune system inherits its behaviour from its response to the primary infection; it goes through a swift transition early in the co-infection (i.e. soon after the onset of the secondary infection) and it is consequently and temporarily driven mainly by its response to the secondary infection. There is a second transition point in the behaviour of the immune system and from there, it no longer resembles a standard response associated to either of the two single infections, but rather it shapes its behaviour to respond to the co-infection itself.",

For each infection group, for time points that have less than five missing values in one feature, we replaced the missing values with the average value of the feature for that specific time point. For infection groups that have missing values at one single time point for one particular feature, we performed a linear interpolation between the mean values of the previous and the next time points and replaced the missing values with the predicted value for that time point. Nodes in the simplicial complex represent clusters of infected mice, and edges connect nodes that contain samples in common. Nodes are colored by the average value of their samples for the variables listed in the Figs' legends and color maps.",
