Prominent examples include rabies vaccines and rinderpest vaccines. Rabies vaccines for domestic animals and wildlife have nearly eliminated human rabies in developed countries. Thanks to the Global Rinderpest Eradication Program which involves vaccination, trade restrictions, and surveillance, rinderpest may soon become only the second disease (after smallpox) to be globally eradicated. Successful examples of new technology animal vaccines that are licensed for use, include gene-deleted marker vaccines, virus-like-particle vaccines, recombinant modified live virus vaccines, chimeric vaccines, and DNA vaccines. Animal vaccines also use a wide variety of novel adjuvants that are not yet approved for use in human vaccines. Animal vaccines can be developed and licensed much more quickly than human vaccines. The West Nile virus was discovered in the United States in August 1999. By August 2001, an Equine vaccine for West Nile virus was conditionally licensed. For animal vaccines to effectively protect animal and public health they must be widely used, which means they must be affordable. The regulatory process must meet the need for assuring safety and efficacy without increasing the cost of licensing and production to the point where they are not affordable to the end user.",

Rinderpest is an acute, highly contagious, viral disease of cattle, domesticated buffalo, and some species of wildlife. In 1889, cattle shipped from India carried the rinderpest virus to Africa, causing an epidemic that established the virus on the continent. Initially, approximately 90% of the cattle in sub-Saharan Africa died as well as many sheep and goats. Wild buffalo, giraffe, and wildebeest populations were decimated. The loss of draft animals, domestic livestock, and wildlife resulted in mass starvation, killing a third of the human population in Ethiopia and two-thirds of the Maasai people of Tanzania. The reduced number of grazing animals allowed thickets to form in grasslands. These thickets served as breeding grounds for tsetse flies, the vector for trypanosomes, resulting in an outbreak of trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness) in humans. This rinderpest epidemic is considered by some to have been the most catastrophic natural disaster ever to affect Africa. The Global Rinderpest Eradication Program is a large-scale international collaboration involving vaccination, local and international trade restrictions, and surveillance. This effort may be one of veterinary medicine's greatest achievements and rinderpest may soon become only the second disease (after smallpox) to be globally eradicated [1] .",

Companion animal vaccines are similar to human vaccines in that the health and welfare of the Veterinary vaccines have a distinct advantage in that they can be developed and licensed much more quickly and at much less cost than human vaccines. The ability to conduct safety and efficacy studies, including vaccination/challenge studies in the target species greatly facilitates licensing of veterinary vaccines. Liability issues associated with adverse reactions for manufacturers of veterinary vaccines are much less than for manufacturers of human vaccines.

The veterinary vaccine industry, working in cooperation with the USDA Center for Veterinary Biologics, quickly developed an effective vaccine to prevent the disease in horses.

Animal and human infectious disease experts need to work together to prepare for new and emerging diseases. Veterinary vaccines must be pure, safe, potent and effective and they must be economical or they won't be widely used. Proper standards and production controls in the manufacture of veterinary vaccines are essential for ensuring quality products for animal disease control. The regulatory process for evaluation of vaccines must ensure adequate evaluation of biologicals but be efficient for both the regulatory agencies and the biologics manufacturers. Keeping the costs of animal vaccines low will encourage more use of vaccines and less use of antibiotics. It will also enable the use of food safety vaccines that do not have an economic advantage for the producer or health advantage to the animal, but have important public health benefits. ",
