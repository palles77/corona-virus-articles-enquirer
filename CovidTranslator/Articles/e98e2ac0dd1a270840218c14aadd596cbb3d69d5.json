            "text": "Background: A hospital-based global budget (GB) program was implemented by the Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance (TBNHI) to control the rising costs of medical care. We investigated whether the introduction of the GB program affected prescriptions for second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) for schizophrenic outpatients in public and private medical and psychiatric centers. Methods: The prescription data of schizophrenic outpatients treated between 2001 and 2004 were retrieved from the TBNHI database, which included outpatients who were diagnosed as having schizophrenia during the period from 1996 to 2001. Because the new health insurance policy may have had a lag effect on physicians' decision regarding SGA prescription, we used January 2004 as the timepoint to divide the data, which was 6 months after GB implementation. Thus, data from the 6-month period immediately after the GB implementation were included in the pre-GB period. Second-generation antipsychotics included in the study were clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, zotepin, and amisulpride. Results: After January 2004, the proportion of SGA use in outpatient departments did not show an upward trend, as had been observed in the pre-GB period, which appeared at a staggering pace lasting for 12 months ( p \u00bc 0.0004). Compared with medical centers, SGA expenditures in the psychiatric centers were less affected in the GB period ( p < 0.0001). Compared to the private sector, the SGA expenditures in the public sector were less affected in the GB period ( p < 0.019). Conclusion: We concluded that the GB implementation reduced SGA expenditures significantly. The extent of influence varied among hospitals (i.e., public versus private, medical versus psychiatric centers), which was most likely caused by financial factors.",

One of these programs is global budgeting (GB). The implementation of GB has resulted in a reduction in the number of admissions and the adoption of an efficient case-mix. 4 The GB program was introduced in Taiwan for dental services in 1998; it was subsequently initiated for Chinese medicine in 2000, for Western medicine community clinics in 2001, and finally for hospital services (including out-and inpatient services) in 2002. Among the four GB programs, the hospital GB program in 2004 accounted for approximately 65% of the total National Health Insurance (NHI) expenditure. 5 The current Taiwan GB program is an expenditure-cap system with a \"floating point value\" mechanism that is used to precisely match the predetermined budget using the formula:",

To meet the predetermined national expenditure, the total expenditure claimed is reimbursed based on an adjusted amountdthe expenditure claimed multiplied by the floating point value. The floating point value for each hospital is retrospectively determined every 3 months after the completion of official review for previous claims. According to the formula, the floating point value is negatively associated with the nationwide service volume, which includes the number of patients seen and issued medical orders. A higher service volume will result in a lower floating point value that year for all contracted hospitals. For the purpose of reducing the growing expenditures on health care, the Bureau of National Health Insurance (BNHI) in Taiwan introduced \"Hospital-based Selfmanagement\" in January 2004, which is a hospital-based GB program. 6 The BNHI encouraged hospitals to participate voluntarily in the Hospital-based Self-management project. Many adaptive medical approaches to the implementation of GB in hospitals have been applied, which include: (1) persuading and enforcing physicians to prescribe cheaper drugs; (2) limiting the kinds of drugs drawn into the hospital; and (3) implementing computerized physician order management to reduce drug expenditures. 7 Because of the impact of GB, changes in physicians' medical behavior such as reduced prescription of drugs, limited daily service hours in clinics, 8 and reduced drug expenditures 9 have been noted in studies conducted in Western countries. The progressive implementation of GB for different medical services has enabled researchers to examine the effects of the policy on clear timelines.",

Business operating characteristics such as finance and management model are assumed to be different among various types of hospitals. 10e12 We postulated that the incentives for psychiatrists to prescribe SGA vary by hospital type.

The SGAs included in the study were clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, zotepin, and amisulpride. We set the \"dividing point\" as January 2004 for several reasons. First, physicians' behavior may have been affected by a lag effect after the implementation of a hospital physician integration strategy. 13 Second, during the months of April 2003 through December 2003, an epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome may have prevented patients from going to the hospitals to see their doctors in person 14 ; they may instead have preferred chronic disease refill cards to maintain their previous treatments. Third, after the implementation of GB, the medical charges in certain areas within hospital departments were still not under GB control from July 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003. 15 The percentages of SGA expenditures (i.e., the expenditure of SGA/the expenditure of all antipsychotics) in outpatient departments were calculated for the observation period.

For the public sector, there is a weaker motivation to reap profits 12 and to receive the maximum budgetary imbursement from the NHI program. There is less financial pressure on public hospitals than on hospitals in the private sector. 12 Public hospitals have consequently shown a slower response to changes in medical policies. 16 In addition, the public sector tends to be held to a higher standard by the general population to meet their expectations, and this suggests that physicians in the public sector are likely to have a stronger concern for the welfare of the patients. 12 Some private hospitals in Taiwan have conversely adopted a physician fee program to improve physicians' performance. Hence, leaders and physicians in public hospitals are probably less influenced by economic incentives. Thus, they may tend to prescribe SGAs more in accordance with their patients' needs and be less affected by nonclinical factors.",

However, global trends of SGA use were obviously changed after the dividing timepoint. Thus, we are confident that GB did indeed have an effect on SGA use, even though not all medical or psychiatric centers joined the GB program during the study period.

In recent years, metabolic syndrome caused by SGAs has become an important issue. 27e29 Many psychiatrists are becoming more cautious and conservative in prescribing SGAs because of education by reading current literature, engaging in peer group discussions, and attending international forums. This effect may be less pronounced in our study for the following reasons. The impact of education with regard to complications of SGA was assumed to be distributed evenly in each type of hospital. After the implementation of GB, there was no official advisory in Taiwan on the metabolic side effects of all kinds of SGAs that was similar to the advisory on SSRIs issued by the FDA in the United States.",

More research is needed on this increasingly important issue because many governments are adopting health policies to contain expenditure, which could result in reduced quality of care, especially for those with severe mental illness. We herein propose several recommendations, based on our findings that health policymakers may find useful. The government should identify psychiatric patients with major psychiatric disorders so that adequate care can be provided, even in the event that the expenditure cap is exceeded. It is also important to carefully evaluate the future impact of health policy prior to its implementation, and subsequently design a more stable strategy to avoid reducing these patients' quality of care (e.g., by limiting the use of SGAs). Furthermore, it is important for the government to value the important contribution of public psychiatric hospitals and to maximize the financial aid and quality of care in the public sector. Further suggestions include the following: after the implementation of GB, outcomes can be compared regarding medical quality or patients' quality of life such as readmission rates, years of hospitalization, suicide rates, and level of patient satisfaction. In addition, the same model can be applied to assess the extent of change in the prescription pattern for other psychotropic medications such as antidepressants, anxiolytics, and mood stabilizers.",
