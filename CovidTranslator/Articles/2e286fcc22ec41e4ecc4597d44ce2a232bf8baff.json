            "text": "Viral infections are a constant threat to the public health and a significant cause of epidemic diseases, morbidity, and deaths worldwide. Specific modes of control against viral infections include vaccine development and antiviral therapies. While vaccine efforts have proven successful in immunizing against several viruses, many viral pathogens remain without a protective vaccine including dengue virus (DENV), human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Antivirals, on the other hand, play an important role for the management of these viral infections when prophylactic vaccines are unavailable. However, to date, only few licensed and cost-effective antiviral drugs are available compared to the number of viral pathogens that threatens the public health. More importantly, due to an increase in global travel and rapid urbanization, the situation is aggravated by risks of epidemic outbreaks from emerging/re-emerging viral infections that are being introduced into non-indigenous areas 6 . Recent outbreaks caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, influenza viruses (H1N1, H5N1, H3N2, and H7N9), DENV, West Nile virus (WNV), measles virus (MV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus, and Ebola virus [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] are among the examples reflecting the need for antivirals development when immunization and/or therapeutics are unavailable. In addition, there is always a potential risk of generating drug-resistant infections with currently used antivirals. Thus, the continuous development and expansion of the scope of antivirals to these emerging/re-emerging viral infections are necessary to provide better management strategies and safeguard the public health.",

            "text": "Most antiviral therapies consist of direct acting antivirals (DAAs) which target a specific viral protein or cofactor that mediates important steps in the viral life cycle. For example, the nucleoside analogue Acyclovir inhibits herpesvirus DNA polymerase, protease inhibitors Boceprevir and Telaprevir antagonize the HCV NS3, and Oseltamivir and Zanamivir are neuraminidase inhibitors that block the release of influenza virus particles from infected cells [13] [14] [15] . There are however very few licensed viral entry inhibitors including Enfuvirtide, which targets HIV gp41 to prevent fusion, and Maraviroc, which blocks the HIV co-receptor CCR5, thereby preventing viral entry 16 . Exploring novel antagonists/inhibitors to viral entry could help provide additional therapeutics for prophylactic or therapeutic use, such as in combination with other antivirals with a different mechanism of action to better manage viral infections [17] [18] [19] . Identification of antivirals can involve structure-guided drug design and candidate drug screening-based strategy. Methods for assessing antiviral activity of test agents include biochemical assays of enzymatic activity and evaluation by cell-based systems [20] [21] [22] [23] . In cell-based systems, the viral life cycle can be dissected into distinct stages of infection, such as entry events (attachment, fusion, uncoating), the replication phase (viral genome replication and protein translation), and virion egress (assembly, maturation, and release). Since the assays can be adapted to investigate each specific stage using various tools and methods, this approach allows identification/examination of potential candidate antivirals with a specific mechanism of action targeting the distinct stage analyzed. For instance, to analyze drug effect specifically on the free virus particles prior to binding to the host cell, a 'viral inactivation assay' can be performed. In this assay, the virus is allowed to incubate with the test drug and then diluted to titrate out the drug before infecting a cell monolayer. Additional steps such as viral attachment and entry/fusion stages can also be analyzed individually, by shifting the temperature during the infection. For many enveloped viruses, viral entry/fusion at the host cell membrane is greatly facilitated at 37 \u00b0C, but is typically precluded at 4 \u00b0C which does not affect virus binding [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Finally, the use of reporter viruses or cell systems could facilitate these studies and permit a high-throughput analysis.",

Both CHLA and PUG effectively prevented binding of the investigated viruses onto the respective host cell as shown by inhibition on the resulting viral infection (Figure 2 , 'Attachment': light gray bars). The inhibitory effect on virus attachment by both compounds was similar against HCMV (Figure 2B) , HCV (Figure 2C) , DENV-2 (Figure 2D) , and RSV (Figure 2F) , ranging from 90 -100%. On the other hand, PUG appeared to be more effective than CHLA against MV binding (Figure 2E) , with the inhibition rate from the two compounds varying between 50 -80%. The control treatment heparin, which is known to block entry of many viruses, also inhibited attachment of HCMV, DENV-2, RSV, ad MV, but was less efficient against HCV. The ensuing 'viral entry/fusion assay' examined whether CHLA and PUG retained their activity during the virus entry/fusion phase (Figure 2 , 'Entry/Fusion': dark gray bars). Again, both CHLA and PUG were observed to effectively impair the viral entry/fusion step of the viruses examined (Figure 2B -F) , yielding a 50 -90% protective effect on the respective cell monolayer. Heparin also potently inhibited entry/fusion in DENV-2 and RSV infections, but was less efficacious against HCMV, HCV, and MV (< 40% inhibition on average). ",

            "text": "In this report the methods to identify and evaluate antiviral compounds based on a mechanistic approach of dissecting the early viral entry events were described. Specifically, the assays allowed us to examine the effect of test compounds on free virus particles, viral attachment, and viral entry/fusion. Critical steps were implemented to distinctly evaluate the drug effect on the specific stage of early viral entry. For instance, in the 'viral inactivation assay', the dilution of the virus-drug mixture to sub-therapeutic concentration prevents significant interaction between the test compound and the host cell surface by 'titrating out' the drug. This ensures that the inhibitory effect observed on the subsequent infection of the host cell is due to a direct interaction between the test compound and the cell-free virions, rather than an effect from the test compound on host cell membrane or membrane-associated molecules, including viral receptors 30 . Similarly, the shift in temperature between 4 \u00b0C (which allows for virus binding but not entry) and 37 \u00b0C (which facilitates virus entry/fusion) in the 'viral attachment assay' and 'viral entry/fusion assay' are crucial to determine the test compound's effect on each of these specific events. This is feasible due to the temperature sensitivity of enveloped viruses during these steps in the infection [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . These issues are important considerations for deciding whether a candidate agent is of value for continuation in subsequent phases of drug development. Similarly, the early viral entry-specific assays described in this report allow examination of the drug effect on the distinct viral entry stage at the cellular level, and more specifically in the context of an authentic viral infection in vitro. The results obtained from such assays would therefore help better predict the antiviral efficacy of the test compounds and also identify potentially unwanted off-target effects against the host cell. One potential limitation though, is that an in vitro cell-based assay may not completely reflect the actual in vivo entry step in the context of a natural viral infection. Nonetheless, the assays presented in this protocol do serve as an analytical platform for mechanism-based identification and evaluation of novel antiviral agents.",

In this report, the infection from luciferasetagged HCV can be easily monitored by quantitating the reporter signal, thus facilitating data analysis. By incorporating these useful reporterbased tools, the early viral entry assays described here can essentially be adapted into high-throughput format for mechanism-based screening of small molecule libraries.",

For HCV, grow the Huh-7.5 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 200 U/ml penicillin G, 200 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin, and 0.5 \u00b5g/ml amphotericin B. 2. Prepare the test compounds and controls using their respective solvents: for example, dissolve CHLA and PUG in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); prepare heparin in sterile double-distilled water. For all subsequent dilutions, use culture media. Note: The final concentration of DMSO in the test compound treatments is less than 1% in the experiments; 1% DMSO is included as a negative control treatment in the assays for comparison.3. Determine the cytotoxicity of the test compounds (e.g., CHLA and PUG) on the cells for the viral infection by using a cell viability determining reagent such as XTT (2,3-bis[2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-5-phenylamino)-carbonyl]-2H-tetrazolium hydroxide): 1. For HCV, seed Huh-7.5 cells in a 96-well plate (1 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well) and incubate at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 incubator O/N to obtain a monolayer. 2. Apply DMSO control (1%) or increasing concentrations of the test compounds CHLA and PUG (ex. 0, 10, 50, 100, and 500 \u03bcM) to the culture wells in triplicate. 3. Incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 72 hr, then discard the medium in the plate and wash the cells with 200 \u03bcl of phosphate buffered saline (PBS)",

Pre-chill the cell monolayers in plates at 4 \u00b0C for 1 hr. 3. Co-treat the cells with HCV inoculum (MOI = 0.01) and test compounds or controls (final concentrations are: CHLA = 50 \u03bcM; PUG = 50 \u03bcM; heparin = 1,000 \u03bcg/ml; DMSO = 1%) at 4 \u00b0C for 3 hr. For example, to a 90 \u03bcl virus inoculum containing 1 x 10 2 FFU, add 10 \u03bcl of a 500 \u03bcM CHLA working dilution; this yields CHLA treatment at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcM and an infection by HCV at MOI = 0.01 on the cell monolayer. Note: It is important to carry out the experiment at 4 \u00b0C since it allows for virus binding but precludes entry which most efficiently occurs at 37\u00b0C . Perform the addition of virus and test compounds on ice and the ensuing incubation in a 4 \u00b0C refrigerator to ensure that the temperature is maintained at 4 \u00b0C. 4.

Higher concentrations of the virus can also be tested by increasing the MOI/PFU. 1. Seed Huh-7.5 cells in a 96-well plate (1 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well) and incubate at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO 2 incubator O/N to obtain a monolayer. 2. Pre-chill the cell monolayers in plates at 4 \u00b0C for 1 hr. 3. Infect the cells with HCV (MOI = 0.01) at 4 \u00b0C for 3 hr. For example, use a 100 \u03bcl virus inoculum containing 1 x 10 2 FFU. Note: Perform the addition of the viral inoculum on ice and the ensuing incubation in a 4 \u00b0C refrigerator to maintain the temperature at 4 \u00b0C, which permits viral binding but not entry. 4. Remove the supernatant and gently wash the cell monolayers with 200 \u03bcl of ice-cold PBS twice. Note: Perform the washes gently to avoid lifting the cells. 5. Treat the wells with the test compounds or controls (final concentrations are: CHLA = 50 \u03bcM; PUG = 50 \u03bcM; heparin = 1,000 \u03bcg/ml; DMSO = 1%) and incubate at 37 \u00b0C for 3 hr. For example, add 10 \u03bcl of a 500 \u03bcM CHLA working dilution to 90 \u03bcl of media, mix, and treat the wells; this yields CHLA treatment at a final concentration of 50 \u03bcM. Note: The shift from 4 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C now facilitates the viral entry/fusion event and therefore allows assessment of test compounds' effect on this particular step. 6. Aspirate the drug-containing supernatant and remove non-internalized extracellular viruses by either washing with 200 \u03bcl of citrate buffer (50 mM sodium citrate, 4 mM potassium chloride, pH 3.0) or PBS. Apply 100 \u03bcl of the basal medium before incubating at 37 \u00b0C for 72 hr. 7. Analyze the resulting infection by assaying the supernatant for luciferase activity as described in '2. Readout of Viral Infection'.",
