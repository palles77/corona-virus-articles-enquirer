            "text": "A novel small molecule thiocarbazate (PubChem SID 26681509), a potent inhibitor of human cathepsin L (EC 3.4.22.15) with an IC 50 of 56 nM, was developed following a 57,821 compound screen of the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository. After a 4 hr preincubation with cathepsin L, this compound became even more potent, demonstrating an IC 50 of 1.0 nM. The thiocarbazate was determined to be a slow-binding and slowly reversible competitive inhibitor. Through a transient kinetic analysis for single-step reversibility, inhibition rate constants were k on = 24,000 M -1 s -1 and k off = 2.2 \u00d7 10 -5 s -1 (K i = 0.89 nM). Molecular docking studies were undertaken using the experimentally-derived X-ray crystal structure of papain/CLIK-148 (1cvz.pdb). These studies revealed critical hydrogen bonding patterns of the thiocarbazate with key active site residues in papain. The thiocarbazate displayed 7-to 151-fold greater selectivity toward cathepsin L than papain and cathepsins B, K, V, and S with no activity against cathepsin G. The inhibitor demonstrated a lack of toxicity in human aortic endothelial cells and zebrafish. Additionally, the thiocarbazate inhibited in vitro propagation of malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum with an IC 50 of 15.4 \u03bcM and inhibited Leishmania major with an IC 50 of 12.5 \u03bcM.",

            "text": "Cathepsins are a family of ubiquitous lysosomal proteases that have demonstrated important physiopathological roles in inflammation, osteo-and rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, pancreatitis, apoptosis, liver disorders, lung disorders, myocardial disorders, diabetes, muscular dystrophy, tumor invasion and metastasis (Fujishima et al., 1997; Leist and Jaattela, 2001; Nomura and Katunuma, 2005; Turk and Guncar, 2003) . Cathepsin L is an endopeptidase that is catalytically the most active known lysosomal cysteine protease (Otto and Schirmeister, 1997) . It is a papain-like cysteine protease of interest due to involvement in many biological processes including epidermal homeostasis, hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling, extracellular matrix degradation, and viral entry of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Ebola virus, and Hendra virus (Chandran et al., 2005; Nomura and Katunuma, 2005; Pager and Dutch, 2005; Simmons et al., 2005; Turk et al., 2001) . Due to the roles of many cathepsin L-like proteases in diseases such as malaria (falcipain), leishmaniasis (Leishmania major cathepsin L), Chagas disease (cruzipain), African trypanosomiasis (congopain), toxoplasmosis (Toxoplasma gondii cathepsin L), amoebiasis (histolysain), and sleeping sickness (rhodesain), inhibitors of human cathepsin L may be highly valuable as therapeutic treatments against these infectious diseases.",

A high throughput screen of 57,821 compounds from the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (BioFocus DPI; San Francisco, CA) was performed against human cathepsin L. The average Z\u2032 factor for the screen was 0.73, indicating good plate uniformity throughout the run (Zhang et al., 1999) . Results of this screen are available on PubChem as BioAssay #460. 3 The major constituent of the most potent hit from the high throughput screen was SID 861540 ( Figure 1A ) with an apparent IC 50 of 130 nM. We subsequently determined through chemical synthesis and structure elucidation by LC-MS that the active compound was actually the ringopened form of oxadiazole SID 861540 (Myers et al., 2008) . SID 26681509 ( Figure 1B) , the more stable, Boc-protected S-enantiomer of the ring-opened by-product, proved to be a potent and reversible human cathepsin L inhibitor. Although thiocarbazate inhibitors of cathepsins have not yet been reported, members of the structurally similar class of aza-peptides have been shown to be effective inhibitors of cysteine proteases (Baggio et al., 1996; Magrath and Abeles, 1992; Thompson et al., 1997; Xing and Hanzlik, 1998) . Herein, we report the biochemical and biological characterization and molecular docking of SID 26681509, a novel, potent, and selective thiocarbazate inhibitor of human cathepsin L.",

Upon 100-fold dilution of the 1 hr preincubated mixture of cathepsin L and the inhibitor into assay buffer containing 1 \u03bcM Z-Phe-Arg-AMC substrate, approximately 11% enzymatic activity was returned after 6000 s into the reaction, by comparison of the substrate conversion rates of the preincubated and uninhibited reactions ( Figure 2B ). For the 4 hr preincubated enzyme-inhibitor reaction condition ( Figure 2C ), 99.8% of the reaction was inhibited immediately after addition of substrate due to almost all the enzyme being bound to small molecule inhibitor SID 26681509. After 8820 s, the rate of product formation for the 4 hr preincubated reaction was 4.7 times greater than the initial rate of product formation, showing that the inhibitor was being released from the enzyme-inhibitor complex and enzymatic activity was indeed recovering.

A potential thiol leaving group formed by reaction of cathepsin L with the thiocarbazate carbonyl of SID 26681509 was synthesized (MW = 195) and was detectable on the LC-MS at a concentration of 100 nM with a retention time of 12.1 min (no suppression detected due to presence of human cathepsin L). However, this thiol leaving group was not detected by LC-MS after 6, 12, and 24 hrs incubation of human cathepsin L with SID 26681509. While this result argues against acylation of cathepsin L by the inhibitor, formation of a tetrahedral intermediate by attack of the active site Cys residue on the thiocarbazate carbonyl of SID 26681509 is not excluded. In fact, when the thiocarbazate sulfur in SID 26681509 is replaced by carbon, the resulting molecule is a much weaker inhibitor (IC 50 > 50 \u03bcM, data not shown).",

As expected, SID 26681509 showed no inhibitory activity against the serine protease cathepsin G. The IC 50 values systematically decreased with time for each protease, demonstrating the slow-binding nature of the small molecule inhibitor. The qualitative order of the selectivity index is fairly insensitive to when the measurement was taken; however, the weak trends observed in the selectivity index data likely reflect the relative rates of slowly reversible inhibition of the enzyme. Thus, it would appear that the slowly reversible reaction proceeds faster for cathepsins V and S than for cathepsin L; whereas, it proceeds more slowly for papain.",

Other researchers have used papain to design highly specific cathepsin inhibitors and CLIK-148 directly inhibits cathepsin L LaLonde et al., 1998; Tsuge et al., 1999) . An effort to construct a cathepsin L homology model based on the coordinates of 1cvz.pdb led to inconclusive docking results, particularly with respect to the arrangement of critical hydrophobic groups in the S2 subsite of the enzyme binding pocket. 4 The co-crystal structure coordinates of human cathepsin L complexed with the small molecule inhibitor E-64 (Fujishima et al., 1997) would have been preferred; however, they were not publicly available. Most of the residues within the catalytic binding site are conserved between papain and cathepsin L, including those in papain that make direct hydrogen bonding contacts to the CLIK-148 inhibitor: Gln19, Cys25, Gly66, Asp158, and Trp177.

Further investigations of SID 26681509 and related analogs against purified cathepsin L-like enzymes such as falcipain, congopain, cruzipain, T. gondii cathepsin L, histolysain, and rhodesain are warranted based on the findings of this study.

This mixture was then diluted 100-fold with assay buffer containing 1 \u03bcM Z-Phe-Arg-AMC. A rapidly reversible inhibitor should dissociate from the enzyme to restore greater than approximately 90% of enzymatic activity. B. Reversibility data for SID 26681509 after 0 min (\u25cb), 15 min (\u0394), 1 hr (\u25a1), and 4 hr (\u25b2) preincubation with cathepsin L and upon 100-fold dilution into assay buffer containing Z-Phe-Arg-AMC. A full enzyme-substrate reaction without inhibitor (\u2022) served as a positive control. By comparing initial substrate conversion rates of the control and 1 hr preincubation study, it can be seen that only 11% enzymatic activity is restored after 6000 s, making SID 26681509 a slowly reversible inhibitor of human cathepsin L.
