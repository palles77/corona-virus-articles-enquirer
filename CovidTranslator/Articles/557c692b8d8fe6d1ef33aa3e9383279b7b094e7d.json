In this study, we compared the transcriptional profiles of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV)-infected monocytic cells against that infected by coronavirus 229E (CoV-229E). Total RNA was extracted from infected DC-SIGN-transfected monocytes (THP-1-DC-SIGN) at 6 and 24 h after infection, and the gene expression was profiled in oligonucleotide-based microarrays. Analysis of immune-related gene expression profiles showed that at 24 h after SARS-CoV infection: (1) IFN-a/b-inducible and cathepsin/proteasome genes were downregulated; (2) hypoxia/ hyperoxia-related genes were upregulated; and (3) TLR/TLR-signaling, cytokine/cytokine receptor-related, chemokine/chemokine receptor-related, lysosome-related, MHC/chaperon-related, and fibrosis-related genes were differentially regulated. These results elucidate that SARS-CoV infection regulates immune-related genes in monocytes/macrophages, which may be important to the pathogenesis of SARS.",

A total of 8096 cases and 774 deaths were reported (50) . About 20% of SARS patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (40) . Chest x-rays revealed bilateral diffuse consolidation in these patients (15) . Massive macrophage infiltration is a prominent feature in the lung sections of patients who died of SARS (36) . We reported that SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infects human monocytes (9) , and that monocytic cells infected by SARS-CoV produce chemokines that attract the migration of neutrophils, macrophages, and activated T lymphocytes (64) . Patients who recovered from SARS often suffered from pulmonary fibrosis (3) , and macrophages play a role in fibroblast accumulation (30) . Thus it is apparent that the immune response plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS, and that monocytes/macrophages are key players in the immunopathogenesis of SARS.",

The gene expression profile induced by SARS-CoV was compared to that expressed by human coronavirus 229E, a group I coronavirus that causes the mild common cold (13) , on the basis that the infectivity of CoV-229E of DC-SIGNtransfected THP-1 cells is comparable to that of SARS-CoV (64) . Since SARS-CoV-induced chemokine gene expression in monocytic cells peaks as early as 24 h (64), we chose to study the gene expression profiles at both 6 and 24 h after infection.

First, a general normalization method was applied to ensure that the ratio of total correct light intensity to green light intensity was 1:1. Second, all the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) dots were adjusted so they appeared to be yellow, as GAPDH should not have been up-or downregulated. All the data were uploaded to the US National Cancer Institute Microarray Website for data processing, transformation, and annotation. The transformed numerical data, with gene annotations, were then downloaded from the website. Genes were highlighted when the average expression ratios (fold change) were > 1.5 ( > 1.5-fold up-regulation) or < 0.67 ( > 1.5-fold downregulation). When the intensity ratio was positive from one replicate and negative from the other replicate, the images from the GPR files were rechecked. If the data were still inconsistent, they were excluded from further analysis. A heat map of the microarray results is shown in Fig. 1 .",

It is worth noting that GIP3, 2,5OAS2, MX1, and IFN-a-inducible protein 44 were downregulated by > 2-fold at both 6 and 24 h after SARS-CoV infection. These results indicate that while CoV-229E induces IFN-a responses, SARS-CoV infection of macrophages not only does not induce IFN-a/b responses, but it also downregulates IFN-related genes. Thus it appears that the type 1 interferon response is intact in CoV-229E-infected monocytes, but is significantly downregulated in SARS-CoV-infected cells.",

Type 1 interferons suppress cellular protein expression to prevent virus replication, and also trigger host immunity against virus infection (35) . It is reported that SARS-CoV infection of primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, in contrast to CoV-229E and influenza infections, induces very low or no IFN-b response (9) . Our results also showed that while CoV-229E induced upregulation of RNA-activated protein kinase EIF2AK, and no change in IFN-a, ISF3g, IFN exonuclease, SARS-CoV infection downregulated the expression of all of the above genes and a host of other genes. Since type I interferons also play important roles in innate immunity, downregulation of their expression not only impairs the antiviral immune response, it also affects the innate immune response, such as the expression of cathepsin/proteasome-and lysosome-related genes that are critical to antigen presentation functions. Therefore, downregulation or null expression of IFN-a/b-related genes is significant as a pathogenic mechanism of SARS-CoV. TLR7 is among the few genes that are upregulated by SARS-CoV (Table 2) . TLR7 was recently shown to appear on the endosomal membrane, and is an intracellular receptor for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (19, 32) . It can distinguish cellular from viral ssRNAs because the cellular RNAs contain a greater number of modified nucleotide bases (m5C, m6A, m5U, and s2U) (26) . It has not been explored whether intracellular TLR7 binds the nucleic acid of SARS-CoV and triggers downstream signals. Our data showing that SARS-CoV induces the upregulation of TLR7 and the negative signal regulator IRAK-M, and the downregulation of the TLR downstream signal molecules MyD88, TRIF1, and SIT-PEC, as well as most of the IFN-a/b-inducible genes, demonstrate that even if TLR7 binds to SARS-CoV nucleic acids, its downstream signaling is inhibited (48, 63) . TRIF can activate IRF3 to initiate type 1 interferon expression. The downregulation of TRIF in SARS-CoV-infected monocytes and upregulation in CoV-229E-infected monocytes, may explain why the interferon response fails in SARS infection. MyD88-IRAK-NF-jB signaling is also inactivated after SARS-CoV infection. However, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 are upregulated in SARS-CoV-infected monocytes. These three TLRs are strong antibacterial Th-17 immune response initiators. In addition, MyD88-independent CD14 signaling is upregulated after SARS-CoV infection. Monocytic CD14 signaling is usually activated in the LPS reaction to bacteria. This means that SARS-CoV fails to initiate an antiviral interferon response, and may induce ineffective antibacterial immunity. It has been shown that Mycobacterium tuberculosis binding to DC-SIGN on dendritic cells inhibits TLR signaling, and thus inhibits dendritic cell maturation (58) . It is therefore also possible that SARS-CoV binding to DC-SIGN on THP-1-DC-SIGN monocytes inhibits TLR signals, as has been demonstrated in M. tuberculosis.",

TGFb is the key mediator of regulatory T cells. Thus, the Treg immune response is unlikely to be upregulated in SARS infection. These findings are consistent with several previous studies measuring cytokine responses in SARS-CoV-infected culture cells or SARS patients (44, 52, 66) . In addition, IL-13 and IFN-c inducible ADRM1 are downregulated. Thus, traditional Th-2 and Th-1 immune responses are unlikely upregulated in SARS infection. Since IL-1, IL-6, CCL2, and IP-10 were not included in the gene chip, even though they were shown to be important in the pathogenesis of SARS in several previous studies, their expression could not be evaluated in this study (7, 30) .",

SARS-CoV infection downregulates most lysosomal enzymes, including GlcNAcp, PPTE2, mannosidase, and ATPase (14KDV1F, protein 1, and 21KDV0C) ( Table 4 ). Being professional antigen-presenting cells, monocytes/macrophages process antigens through the activities of cathepsins and proteasomes, and present antigens via chaperon/MHC molecules (38) . It is interesting that SARS-CoV infection downregulates all the cathepsin and proteasome genes, and most of the chaperon/MHC genes (Tables 4, 5 , and 6), and that most of these downregulated genes in the proteasome family are directly or indirectly interrelated (Fig. 2) , seemingly rendering monocytes/macrophages unable to process and present antigens. Thus it appears that by downregulating the genes that are important to antigen processing and presentation, SARS-CoV suppresses the primary functions of monocytes/ macrophages. Since interferon-a/b upregulates MHC-related genes, the downregulation of interferon-a/b genes could be partially responsible for the downregulation of MHC-related genes (47) . It is our speculation that by suppressing the antigen-processing and presentation functions of monocytes/ macrophages, SARS-CoV delays specific T-cell activation and thus delays its own clearance.",

We have demonstrated infiltration of neutrophils, macrophages, and T lymphocytes in the lungs of SARS-CoV-infected patients during the early phase of infection (64) , and CXCL8/ IL-8 was produced by SARS-CoV-infected monocytes. The results of microarray analysis showed that CXCL8/IL-8 was upregulated > 2-fold (Table 7) . Pathway network analysis showed that many genes that upregulate CXCL8/IL-8 were upregulated after SARS-CoV infection (Fig. 2) . These include C/EBP delta, CD14, and complement C3 (11, 42, 59, 62) . A previous study demonstrated that C/EBP delta can substitute for IL-17 to induce neutrophil activation and accumulation (45) . Interestingly, alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP, Fig. 2 ), which is known to suppress IL-8 expression (25) , was downregulated after SARS-CoV infection. We have previously shown using RNase protection and protein chip assays that CCL5/RANTES and CCL3/MIP-1b were upregulated upon infection of THP-1-DC-SIGN cells at day 1 after infection (64) . However, possibly due to the difference in the sensitivity of the methodologies, this was not the case by oligonucleotidebased microarray analysis. Taken together, SARS-CoV infection induces the upregulation of genes that upregulate and the downregulation of the gene that suppresses CXCL8/IL-8, showing that inducing neutrophil migration and activation is an important event in SARS-CoV infection.",

Knockout mice that are deficient in leukotriene are protected from lung fibrosis induced by bleomycin (41) . No increase of inflammatory cells in the lungs was noted in the knockout mice, in contrast to wild-type mice, which have abundant leukocytes. LTXA4 hydroxylase catalyzes the production of leukotriene B4 from leukotriene A4, while leukotriene C4 (LTXC4) synthases mediate the production of leukotriene C4 from leukotriene A4 (29, 34) . Our results showing downregulation of LTXC4 synthase and upregulation of LTXA4 hydroxylase (Table 7) indicate that there is increased leukotriene B4 accumulation after SARS-CoV infection. Therefore, leukotriene B4, a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils (39) , could also account for the increase in neutrophil migration to the lungs. PGE is commonly used as a treatment for ARDS (57) . PGE 2 inhibits fibroblast proliferation, collagen synthesis, and fibroblast chemotaxis (4). In cyclo-oxygenase-2-deficient mice, the severity of intratracheal bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis is increased due to a reduction in PGE 2 (20) . It is worth noting that both prostaglandin E and prostaglandin D synthetases (PGES and PGDS) are downregulated in SARS-CoV-infected cells ( Table 7 ), implying that reduced PGE 2 levels in SARS patients may contribute to lung fibrosis. PGD 2 and PGE 2 are important Th-2 immune mediators. Thus Th-2 immunity is likely suppressed in SARS infection. PDGF is a major fibroblast mitogen (61) . It also serves as a chemoattractant for neutrophils, monocytes, and fibroblasts (49) . Therefore upregulation of PDGF receptor a by SARS-CoV (Table 7) through PDGF signaling would result in fibroblast proliferation, neutrophil and monocyte infiltration, and worsened lung fibrosis (1) .",

A previous study revealed that collagen III is upregulated in ARDS, and increased levels are related to poor prognosis (10) . Collagen Ia2 and collagen XVIIIa1 are downregulated by SARS-CoV infection ( Table 8) . Studies have also shown that TIMP deficiency or a TIMP/MMP imbalance contributes to pulmonary fibrosis (18, 27, 46) . Fibrinolytic proteins are protective against lung fibrosis (28) . SARS-CoV infection upregulates proteinases, including MMP28, ADAM19, and SERPINB2, and downregulates TIMP1, TIMP3, and fibrinolytic protein (protein S) ( Table 8 ). Our data showing the up-and downregulation of fibrosis-related genes provide the molecular basis of the clinical presentation of pulmonary fibrosis in SARS.",
