Because viruses are obligate intracellular parasites only able to replicate inside the appropriate host cells, the genome must contain information encoded in a way that can be recognized and decoded by the particular type of host cell. The genetic code used by the virus must match or at least be recognized by the host organism. Similarly, the control signals that direct the expression of virus genes must be appropriate to the host. Many of the DNA viruses of eukaryotes closely resemble their host cells in terms of the biology of their genomes. Chapter 4 describes the ways in which virus genomes are replicated, and Chapter 5 deals in more detail with the mechanisms that regulate the expression of virus genetic information. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the diversity of virus genomes and to consider how and why this variation may have arisen.",

Once inside the nucleus of the host cell, these genomes behave like miniature satellite chromosomes, controlled by cellular enzymes and the cell cycle: I Vaccinia virus mRNAs were found to be polyadenylated at their 3 0 ends by Kates in 1970-the first time this observation had been made in any organism. I Split genes containing noncoding introns, protein-coding exons, and spliced mRNAs were first discovered in adenoviruses by Roberts and Sharp in 1977. Introns in prokaryotes were first discovered in the genome of bacteriophage T4 in 1984 . Several examples of this phenomenon have now been discovered in T4 and some other phages. This raises an important point. The conventional view is that prokaryote genomes are smaller and replicate faster than those of eukaryotes and hence can be regarded as \"streamlined.\" The genome of phage T4 consists of 160 kbp of double-stranded DNA and is highly compressed, for example, promoters and translation control sequences are nested within the coding regions of overlapping upstream genes. The presence of introns in bacteriophage genomes, which are under constant ruthless pressure to exclude \"junk sequences,\" suggests that these genetic elements must have evolved mechanisms to escape or neutralize this pressure and to persist as parasites within parasites. All virus genomes experience pressure to minimize their size. Viruses with prokaryotic hosts must be able to replicate sufficiently quickly to keep up with their host cells, and this is reflected in the compact nature of many (but not all) bacteriophages.",

DNA virus genomes can be analyzed directly by restriction endonuclease digestion without resorting to molecular cloning, and this approach was achieved for the first time with SV40 DNA in 1971. The first pieces of DNA to be molecularly cloned were restriction fragments of bacteriophage \u03bb DNA which were cloned into the DNA genome of SV40 by Berg and colleagues in 1972.

Although genetic coding capacity can be examined in vitro by the use of cell-free extracts to translate mRNAs, complete functional analysis of virus genomes can only be performed on intact viruses.

In this case, direct introduction of RNA into cells circumvents the earliest stages of the replicative cycle (Chapter 4). Virus genomes that are composed of double-stranded DNA are also infectious. The events that occur here are a little more complex, as the virus genome must first be transcribed by host polymerases to produce mRNA. This is relatively simple for phage genomes introduced into prokaryotes, but for viruses that replicate in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, such as herpesviruses, the DNA must first find its way to the appropriate cellular compartment. Most of the DNA that is introduced into cells by transfection is degraded by cellular nucleases.

Synthetic RNA transcribed in vitro from the cDNA template of the genome is much more efficient at initiating infection. Such experiments are referred to as \"reverse genetics\"-that is, the manipulation of a virus via a cloned intermediate. Using these techniques, virus can be rescued from cloned genomes, including those that have been manipulated in vitro. Originally, this type of approach was not possible for analysis of viruses with negative-sense genomes. This is because all negative-sense virus particles contain a virusspecific polymerase. The first event when these virus genomes enter the cell is that the negative-sense genome is copied by the polymerase, forming either positive-sense transcripts that are used directly as mRNA or a double-stranded molecule, known either as the replicative intermediate or replicative form, which serves as a template for further rounds of mRNA synthesis. Therefore, because purified negative-sense genomes cannot be directly translated by the host cell and are not replicated in the absence of the virus polymerase, these genomes are inherently noninfectious. However, systems have now been developed that permit the rescue of viruses with negative-sense genomes from purified or cloned nucleic acids. All such systems rely on a ribonucleoprotein complex that can serve as a template for genome replication by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, but they fall into one of two approaches: ",

In some viruses, mutation rates may be as high as 10 23 to 10 24 per incorporated nucleotide (e.g., in retroviruses such as HIV), whereas in others they may be as low as 10 28 to 10 211 (e.g., in herpesviruses), which is similar to the mutation rates seen in cellular DNA. These differences are due to the mechanism of genome replication, with error rates in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases generally being higher than DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Some RNA virus polymerases do have proofreading functions, but in general mutation rates are higher in most RNA viruses than in DNA viruses. For a virus, mutations are a mixed blessing. The ability to generate antigenic variants that can escape the immune response is a clear advantage, but mutation also results in many defective particles, as most mutations are deleterious. In the most extreme cases (e.g., HIV), the error rate is 10 23 to 10 24 per nucleotide incorporated. The HIV genome is approximately 9.7 kb long; therefore, there will be 0.9\u00c09.7 mutations in every genome copied. Hence, in this case, the wild-type virus actually consists of a fleeting majority type that dominates the dynamic equilibrium (i.e., the population of genomes) present in all cultures of the virus. These mixtures of molecular variants are known as quasispecies and also occur in other RNA viruses (e.g., picornaviruses). However, the majority of these variants will be noninfectious or seriously disadvantaged and are therefore rapidly weeded out of a replicating population. This mechanism is an important force in virus evolution (see \"The Virome-Evolution and Epidemiology\"). Historically, most genetic analysis of viruses has been performed on virus mutants isolated from mutagen-treated populations. Currently, defined and highly specific mutations in particular genes or control sequences (e.g., single nucleotide changes) are usually introduced using molecular methods such as PCR.

I Deletions: Similar in some ways to nonsense mutants (below) but may include one or more virus genes and involve noncoding control regions of the genome (promoters, etc.). Spontaneous deletion mutants often accumulate in virus populations as defective-interfering (DI) particles. These noninfectious but not necessarily genetically inert genomes are thought to be important in establishing the course and pathogenesis of certain virus infections (see Chapter 6). Genetic deletions can only revert to wild-type by recombination, which usually occurs at comparatively low frequencies. Deletion mutants are very useful for assigning structure\u00c0function relationships to virus genomes, as they are easily mapped by physical analysis. I Host range: This term can refer either to whole animal hosts or to permissive cell types in vitro. Conditional mutants of this class have been isolated using amber-suppressor cells (mostly for phages but also for animal viruses using in vitro systems). I Nonsense: These result from alteration of coding sequence of a protein to one of three translation stop codons (UAG, amber; UAA, ocher; UGA, opal). Translation is terminated, resulting in the production of an amino-terminal fragment of the protein. The phenotype of these mutations can be suppressed by propagation of virus in a cell (bacterial or, more recently, animal) with altered suppressor tRNAs. Nonsense mutations are rarely \"leaky\" (i.e., the normal function of the protein is completely obliterated) and can only revert to wild-type at the original site, so they usually have a low reversion frequency. I Plaque morphology: Mutants may be either large-plaque mutants which replicate more rapidly than the wild-type, or small-plaque mutants, which are the opposite. Plaque size is often related to a temperature-sensitive (t.s.) phenotype. These mutants are often useful as unselected markers in multifactorial crosses. I Temperature-sensitive (t.s.): This type of mutation is very useful as it allows the isolation of conditional-lethal mutations, a powerful means of examining virus genes that are essential for replication and whose function cannot otherwise be interrupted. Temperature-sensitive mutations usually result from mis-sense mutations in proteins (i.e., amino acid substitutions), resulting in proteins of full size with subtly altered conformation that can function at (permissive) low temperatures but not at (nonpermissive) higher ones. Generally, the mutant proteins are immunologically unaltered, which is frequently useful. These mutations are usually \"leaky\"-that is, some of the normal activity is retained even at nonpermissive temperatures. Protein function is often impaired, even at permissive temperatures, therefore a high frequency of reversion is often a problem with this type of mutation because the wild-type virus replicates faster than the mutant. I Cold-sensitive (c.s.): These mutants are the opposite of temperaturesensitive mutants and are very useful in bacteriophages and plant viruses whose host cells can be propagated at low temperatures but are less useful for animal viruses because their host cells generally will not grow at significantly lower temperatures than normal. I Revertants: Reverse mutation is a valid type of mutation in its own right. Most of the above classes can undergo reverse mutation, which may be either simple \"back mutations\" (i.e., correction of the original mutation) or second-site \"compensatory mutations,\" which may be physically distant from the original mutation and not even necessarily in the same gene as the original mutation. I Suppression: Suppression is the inhibition of a mutant phenotype by a second suppressor mutation, which may be either in the virus genome or in that of the host cell. This mechanism of suppression is not the same as the suppression of chain-terminating amber mutations by host-encoded suppressor tRNAs, which could be called \"informational suppression.\" Genetic suppression results in an apparently wild-type phenotype from a virus which is still genetically mutant-a pseudorevertant. This phenomenon has been best studied in prokaryotic systems, but examples have been discovered in animal viruses-for example, reoviruses, vaccinia, and influenza-where suppression has been observed in an attenuated vaccine, leading to an apparently virulent virus.

Subsequent generations of viruses inherit and display the original parental phenotypes. This process can occur easily in viruses with naked capsids (nonenveloped) which are closely related (e.g., different strains of enteroviruses) or in enveloped viruses, which need not be related to one another (Figure 3 .4). In this latter case, the phenomenon is due to the nonspecific incorporation of different virus glycoproteins into the envelope, resulting in a mixed phenotype. Rescue of replication-defective transforming retroviruses by a helper virus is a form of pseudotyping. Phenotypic mixing has proved to be a very useful tool to examine biological properties of viruses.

The family is divided into three subfamilies, based on their nucleotide sequence and biological properties (Table 3 .1). Herpesviruses have large genomes composed of up to 235 kbp of linear, double-stranded DNA and correspondingly large and complex virus particles containing about 35 virion polypeptides. All encode a variety of enzymes involved in nucleic acid metabolism, DNA synthesis, and protein processing (e.g., protein kinases). The different members of the family are widely separated in terms of genomic sequence and proteins, but all are similar in terms of structure and genome organization (Figure 3 .10A). Some but not all herpesvirus genomes consist of two covalently joined sections, a unique long (U L ) and a unique short (U S ) region, each bounded by inverted repeats. The repeats allow structural rearrangements of the unique region. This arrangement allows these genomes to exist as a mixture of four structural isomers, all of which are functionally equivalent (Figure 3 .10B). Herpesvirus genomes also contain multiple repeated sequences and, depending on the number of these, the genome size of different isolates of a particular virus can vary by up to 10 kbp. The prototype member of the family is herpes simplex virus (HSV), whose genome consists of approximately 152 kbp of double-stranded DNA, the complete nucleotide sequence of which has now been determined.

Segmentation means that the virus avoids \"having all its eggs in one basket\" and also reduces the probability of breakages due to shearing, thus increasing the total potential coding capacity of the entire genome.

Reassortment can occur whether the segments are packaged into a single particle or are in a multipartite configuration. Reassortment is a powerful means of achieving rapid generation of genetic diversity; this could be another possible reason for its evolution. Segmentation of the genome also has implications for the partition of genetic information and the way in which it is expressed, which will be considered further in Chapter 5. To understand the complexity of these genomes, consider the organization of a segmented virus genome (influenza A virus) and a multipartite genome (geminivirus). The influenza virus genome is composed of eight segments (in influenza A and B strains; seven in influenza C) of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA (Table 3 .2). The identity of the proteins encoded by each genome segment were determined originally by genetic analysis of the electrophoretic mobility of the individual segments from reassortant viruses and by analysis of a large number of mutants covering all eight segments. The eight segments have common nucleotide sequences at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends (Figure 3 .15) which are necessary for replication of the genome (Chapter 4). These sequences are complementary to one another, and, inside the particle, the ends of the genome segments are held together by base-pairing and form a panhandle structure that again is believed to be involved in replication. The RNA genome segments are not packaged as naked nucleic acid but in association with the gene 5 product, the nucleoprotein, and are visible in electron micrographs as helical structures. Here there is a paradox. Biochemically and genetically, each genome segment behaves as an individual, discrete entity; however, in electron micrographs of influenza virus particles disrupted with nonionic detergents, the nucleocapsid has the physical appearance of a single, long helix. Clearly, there is some interaction between the genome segments and it is this which explains the ability of influenza virus particles to select and package the genome segments within each particle with a surprisingly low error rate, considering the difficulty of the task (Chapter 2). In many tropical and subtropical parts of the world, geminiviruses are important plant pathogens. Geminiviruses are divided into three genera based on their host plants (monocotyledons or dicotyledons) and insect vectors (leafhoppers or whiteflies). In the Mastrevirus and Curtovirus genera, the genome consists of a single-stranded DNA molecule of approximately 2.7 kb. The DNA packaged into these virions has been arbitrarily designated as positive-sense, although both the positive-sense and negative-sense strands found in infected cells contain proteincoding sequences. The genome of geminiviruses in the genus Begmovirus is bipartite and consists of two circular, single-stranded DNA molecules, each of which is packaged into a separate particle (Figure 3.16) . Both of the strands comprising the genome are approximately 2.7 kb long and differ from one another completely in nucleotide sequence, except for a shared 200-nt noncoding sequence involved in DNA replication. The two genomic DNAs are packaged into entirely separate capsids. Because a productive infection requires both parts of the genome, it is necessary for a minimum of two virus particles bearing one copy of each of the genome segments to infect a new host cell. Although geminiviruses do not multiply in the tissues of their insect vectors (nonpropagative transmission), a sufficiently large amount of virus is ingested and subsequently deposited onto a new host plant to favor such superinfections. An even more Organization and protein-coding potential of a bipartite begmovirus (Geminiviridae) genome. Proteins encoded by the positive-sense virion strand are named \"A\" or \"B\" depending on which of the two genome components they are located on, or \"V\" or \"C\" depending on whether they are encoded by the positive-sense virion strand of the negative-sense complementary strand. extreme example is that of the Nanoviruses, multipartite viruses with up to 11 genome segments.",

Bacteriophage Mu infects E. coli and consists of a complex, tailed particle containing a linear, double-stranded DNA genome of about 37 kb, with host-cell-derived sequences of between 0.5 and 2 kbp attached to the righthand end of the genome (Figure 3 .17). Mu is a temperate bacteriophage whose replication can proceed through two pathways; one involves integration of the genome into that of the host cell and results in lysogeny, and the other is lytic replication, which results in the death of the cell (see Chapter 5). Integration of the phage genome into that of the host bacterium occurs at random sites in the cell genome. Integrated phage genomes are known as prophage, and integration is essential for the establishment of lysogeny. At intervals in bacterial cells lysogenic for Mu, the prophage undergoes transposition to a different site in the host genome. The mechanism leading to transposition is different from that responsible for the initial integration of the phage genome (which is conservative in that it does not involve replication) and is a complex process requiring numerous phageencoded and host-cell proteins. Transposition is tightly linked to replication of the phage genome and results in the formation of a \"co-integrate\"-that is, a duplicate copy of the phage genome flanking a target sequence in which insertion has occurred. The original Mu genome remains in the same location where it first integrated and is joined by a second integrated genome at another site. (Not all prokaryotic transposons use this process; some, such as TN10, are not replicated during transposition but are excised from the original integration site and integrate elsewhere.) There are two consequences of such a transposition. First, the phage genome is replicated during this process (advantageous for the virus), and second, the sequences flanked by the two phage genomes (which form repeated sequences) are at risk of secondary rearrangements, including deletions, inversions, duplications, and translocations (possibly but not necessarily deleterious for the host cell).",

Some of the steps in reverse transcription have remained mysteries-for example, the apparent jumps that the polymerase makes from one end of the template strand to the other. In fact, these steps can be explained by the observation that complete conversion of retrovirus RNA into double-stranded DNA only occurs in a partially uncoated core particle and cannot be duplicated accurately in vitro with the reagents free in solution.

In addition, the process of reverse transcription promotes genetic recombination. Because two RNAs are packaged into each virion and used as the template for reverse transcription, recombination can and does occur between the two strands. Although the mechanism responsible for this is not clear, if one of the RNA strands differs from the other (e.g., by the presence of a mutation) and recombination occurs, then the resulting virus will be genetically distinct from either of the parental viruses.",

Three forms of double-stranded DNA are found in retrovirus-infected cells following reverse transcription: linear DNA and two circular forms that contain either one or two LTRs. From the structure at the ends of the provirus, it was previously believed that the two-LTR circle was the form used for integration. In recent years, systems that have been developed to study the integration of retrovirus DNA in vitro show that it is the linear form that integrates.

            "text": "When the International Committee on Nomenclature of Viruses was created in 1966, we knew hundreds of viruses but little about most of them. This made it difficult to see how they were related to each other. Eventually it was agreed that some viruses were sufficiently similar to allow them to be grouped together as a genus-in the same way that horses (Equus caballus) are in the same genus as donkeys (Equus asinus). The next step was to group similar genera (plural of genus) together as families. At that point, there was a pause for some years until it was agreed that similar virus families could be grouped into orders, of which seven have now been recognized. This change happened after enough nucleotide sequence data had been accumulated to make the faint evolutionary relationships between distantly related viruses apparent. Why does it matter? In part because this is a window on the past allowing us to look back millions of years through these genetic fossils, but much more importantly because it points to what viruses are capable of and where they might be going in the future. And that's something we should all worry about.",

The net result of integration is that 1\u00c02 bp are lost from the end of each LTR and 4\u00c06 bp of cellular DNA are duplicated on either side of the provirus.
