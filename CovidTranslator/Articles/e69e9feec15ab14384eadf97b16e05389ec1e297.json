            "text": "The mechanisms by which neurons respond to inflammatory mediators such as interferons (IFNs) remain largely undefined. We previously showed that the activation and nuclear localization of the core IFN signaling molecule, Stat1, are muted and delayed in primary mouse hippocampal neurons treated with IFN gamma as compared to control mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF). Here, we show that the kinetics of Stat1 and Stat2 activation following type I IFN exposure are also unique in neurons, affecting gene expression and neuronal response. Specifically, despite lower basal expression of many IFN stimulated genes in neurons, basal expression of the type I IFN themselves is significantly higher in primary hippocampal neurons compared to MEF. Elevated homeostatic IFN in neurons is critical and sufficient for early control of viral infection. These data provide further evidence that neurons exploit unique signaling responses to IFNs, and define an important contribution of homeostatic IFN within the CNS. Such differences are likely critical for the ability of neurons to survive a viral challenge.",

            "text": "The host immune response can efficiently resolve certain neurotropic infections, but unregulated or chronic immune responses in the central nervous system (CNS) can be pathogenic and often fatal. Immune dysregulation within the brain can result in encephalitis and meningitis, and contributes to many chronic neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Therefore, a balance must be achieved in which pathogen control or clearance is achieved with minimal neuropathology. This is particularly relevant for infections of CNS neurons, which are a chiefly non-renewable cell population. Well-defined immune mechanisms that clear viral infections in the periphery, including perforins and granzymes, are underutilized in the brain, perhaps protecting the neuronal population from immune-mediated cytolysis. Instead, cytokines, including the interferons (IFNs), are fundamental contributors to CNS virus clearance. Thus, an overarching goal of our studies is to elucidate the unique interactions of IFNs with neuronal targets, and to define how IFN signaling limits or clears neurotropic infections in the absence of CNS disease. Viral reproduction in the CNS is a relatively rare, albeit serious, consequence of infection by a number of human viruses. While some viruses are well-known to be neurotropic (e.g., poliovirus, rabies virus, West Nile virus, and some herpesviruses), others that are primarily associated with peripheral infections, including influenza and measles, can also result in lifethreatening CNS complications (7) . For example, influenza has been associated with encephalitis, Reye's Syndrome, and acute necrotizing encephalopathy, particularly in children (8) . Moreover, measles virus (MV) infection of CNS neurons is associated with invariably fatal diseases such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which can occur months to years after primary virus exposure (9) . While some of these viruses gain access to the brain parenchyma due to a weakened immune response (e.g., herpesviruses), most result in neuropathology via induction of the immune response (10) .",

            "text": "An early and essential line of defense against viral infection is the induction of interferons (IFNs) that ultimately leads to antiviral gene expression (reviewed in 11) . Briefly, in most mammalian cells, viruses are detected by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Tolllike receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (Rig-I). Recognition of viral nucleic acid in infected cells by these receptors leads to downstream signaling, including activation of transcription factors NF-kB and IFN-regulatory factors 3 and 7 (Irf3, Irf7). Migration of these transcription factors into the nucleus induces expression of genes encoding type I IFNs (IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2). Once released from the cell, IFNs then bind to their receptor (Ifnar, composed of Ifnar1 and Ifnar2 subunits) on the surface of neighboring cells, leading to activation of Janus-activated kinase 1 (Jak1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2). Signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 2 (Stat1, Stat2) are recruited to the activated receptor and are phosphorylated by Jak1 and Tyk2, resulting in a complex of Stat1, Stat2 and IFN regulatory factor 9 (Irf9). This ISGF3 complex then translocates to the nucleus and binds IFN-sensitive response elements (ISREs) in the promoters of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Expression of ISGs leads to induction of an antiviral state (reviewed in 11).",

            "text": "While IFNs are generally recognized as indispensable for an effective immune response, cell type-specific properties may diversify how cells respond to the same extracellular ligand. This is governed in part by the variety, level and distribution of Stat molecules in a given cell type, as type I IFNs are able to activate all seven known Stat molecules. Thus, following engagement of the IFN receptor, distinct Stat homo-and heterodimer complexes may form, and interactions between such complexes and promoter elements determine what genes will be up-or down-regulated (reviewed in 12). For example, in immune cells, type I IFN aids in activation and Th1 skewing of naive T cells (13) , promotes survival and cytolytic activity of CD8 + T cells, and ensures efficient antibody response by B cells (14) (15) . Non-immune cells have varied responses to IFNs as well. For example, in primary human hepatocytes, IFN\u03b1 triggers an antiviral and antitumor state (16) . Cardiac myocytes, which, like neurons, are a non-renewable cell population, express higher basal levels of IFN\u03b2 than cardiac fibroblasts, likely as a \"pre-arming\" mechanism to protect against viral infection (17) . Within the CNS, distinct cellular responses to IFN could play a role in infection and immunity as well as neurodegenerative diseases and the response to injury or ischemia (18) .",

Using this model, we showed that adult mice clear MV infection from CNS neurons without neurological damage or neuronal loss in an IFN\u03b3-and T cell-dependent manner (20) . Primary hippocampal neurons can be explanted from these mice and grown in culture; while all neurons of NSE-CD46 transgenic mice are CD46-positive, and therefore permissive, the hippocampus of day e15-16 embryos is very neuron-rich, enabling virtually pure cultures. When we assessed IFN\u03b3 signaling in these hippocampal neurons, we found that the response to IFN\u03b3 treatment was distinct from that observed in control MEF. Specifically, neurons responded to IFN\u03b3 with delayed and attenuated kinetics of Stat1 expression and activation, resulting in a concomitantly delayed and reduced expression of classic IFN\u03b3-dependent genes (18) . These foundational studies indicate that IFN\u03b3 activates a critical antiviral program in neurons, but that Stat1 plays a subordinated role in this response.",

Utilizing NSE-CD46 mice and primary neurons explanted from these mice, we show here that hippocampal neurons respond to type I IFN with an unique ISG signature. Moreover, exogenous type I IFN enhances resistance to viral infection in primary fibroblasts, but not in primary neurons. We provide evidence that neurons express increased basal levels of type I IFNs compared to fibroblasts, which we hypothesize is critical for controlling early infection in the absence of exogenous IFN. This suggests that within the CNS, neurons respond uniquely to crucial cytokines produced soon after infection, and we hypothesize that this may be a protective mechanism to ensure survival during infection and the subsequent adaptive immune response.",

The dose of 100U/mL IFN\u03b2 was chosen to be consistent with (or below) the majority of published work on type I IFNs. We first assessed the activation of Stat1 and Stat2 following IFN\u03b2 exposure. As previously shown, primary neurons have a lower homeostatic expression of Stat1 than control fibroblasts, which we originally hypothesized was the basis for the muted and delayed transcriptional response following IFN\u03b3 engagement (18) . Despite lower basal levels of Stat1 in neurons, however, both neurons and MEFs showed rapid induction of activated Stat1 (Fig. 1A) . Though MEFs had a more robust pStat1 signal at early times post-IFN exposure, phosphorylation of Stat1 was prolonged in neurons. Similarly, basal Stat2 levels were also lower in neurons, but again, the early kinetics of Stat2 phosphorylation were approximately equal between the two cell populations, with neuronal Stat2 phosphorylation sustained through 24 hours post-exposure (Fig. 1B) . Thus, despite similar induction profiles between the two primary cell populations, the activation of canonical signaling molecules is sustained in neurons following IFN\u03b2 addition.",

We hypothesized that expression of some genes may not be significantly elevated following IFN exposure if basal expression was already high. To determine whether this was the case, we compared basal expression levels of these genes in neurons and MEF (Fig. 3) . Raw data (expressed as differences in dCt values) are shown in Fig. 3A , and fold-differences are represented in Fig. 3B (Fig. 3Bi : genes with higher basal levels in MEF; Fig. 3Bii : genes with higher basal levels in neurons). Notably, both Stat1 and Irf7, which were more highly induced in neurons following IFN\u03b2 exposure, were expressed at significantly higher levels in MEF under basal conditions. Interestingly, there was no difference in basal levels of Irf3, which together with Irf7 plays a role in regulating expression of type I IFNs. Also of interest were the basal expression levels of both Oas1a and Isg15. While MEF, but not neurons, highly up-regulate Oas1a in response to IFN\u03b2, there were no significant differences in the basal expression levels of this gene in either cell type. In contrast, Isg15, which is also disproportionately induced in MEF following IFN\u03b2 exposure, was expressed at significantly higher levels in untreated neurons as compared to MEF. Importantly, expression of the Ifnar1 and Ifnar 2 subunits at the RNA level do not differ significantly between the two cell types (data not shown). Thus, basal (or homeostatic) cell-type specific gene expression profiles appear to be a variable in determining the magnitude of induction of these genes following exposure to type I IFN.",

In these mice, only CNS neurons are permissive, allowing us to determine how the presence or absence of IFN signaling influenced viral pathogenesis. Surprisingly, greater than 75 percent of MV-challenged CD46/Ifnar KO survived infection, in contrast to CD46/ Rag-2 KO mice, which all showed significant weight loss coincident with the appearance of signs of CNS disease, including ataxia, ruffled appearance, and seizures (Fig. 6C) . While viral titers from CD46/Ifnar KO mice were substantially higher than control, immunocompetent CD46 mice at early times post-infection (days 3-10), CD46/Ifnar KO mice eventually cleared the infection with similar kinetics to control mice (Fig. 6B) , likely owing to the presence of the protective adaptive immune response which appears within the CNS by 7-10 days post-infection. (Of note, CD46/Ifnar KO mice succumb to a peripheral infection with wild type vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) much earlier than immunocompetent mice, as previously published (data not shown) (27) ).

Second, we provide evidence that despite lower basal expression of select ISGs in neurons, basal expression of type I IFNs themselves is significantly higher in neurons compared to fibroblasts.

We have previously shown that neurons respond uniquely to IFN\u03b3, with markedly delayed, attenuated, and prolonged phosphorylation of Stat1 (18) . It was surprising to find that, in contrast, neurons and fibroblasts respond equally rapidly to IFN\u03b2. There is evidence to suggest that expression levels of various Stats influence which are actually activated by type I IFN (26) . It is possible that, due to reduced basal expression of both Stat1 and Stat2 in neurons, other Stat molecules or other IFN-induced pathways are more highly activated, thus skewing the cellular response to a soluble ligand.",

While differences in gene induction between the two cell types can likely be attributed to the variation in basal expression of these genes, it will be of interest to determine the mechanisms underlying selective gene profiles such as Isg15, which are more highly and consistently expressed in neurons. We have not determined whether the higher levels of IFN expression in neurons are functioning in autocrine loops or whether mRNA or protein is stored for rapid synthesis and release in the event of infection or injury (30) (31) (32) (33) . However, given that, of the two primary transcription factors that drive expression of type I IFN, Irf7 expression is lower in neurons and Irf3 expression is comparable between the two cell types, it is reasonable to speculate that increased type I IFN mRNA in neurons results from increased stability or neuronal storage of the RNA rather than higher levels of transcription. Cardiac myocytes, which are similar to neurons in that they are a nonrenewable cell population, express increased levels of IFN\u03b2 and several components of the Jak-Stat signaling pathway (29) , suggesting that vulnerable cell populations may utilize higher basal IFN expression as a mechanism to protect against viral infection. Combined with data presented here, a compelling case can be made that vulnerable cell populations such as neurons may be \"pre-armed\" to respond quickly and specifically under conditions of viral challenge.",

However, exposure of various cell types to type I IFN renders cells less responsive to future exposure to the same cytokine (25) . It is conceivable, then, that neurons produce sufficient quantities of type I IFN to desensitize them from future exposure to IFN, and possibly other cytokines, produced by resident glial cells and incoming immune cells. This would render them less responsive to, and therefore protected from, the incoming immune response to infection.",

Interestingly, while the absence of type I IFN signaling leads to increased viral load in MV-infected NSE-CD46 mice, its absence has a minimal impact on survival. Using a similar mouse model, it was shown that survival of Ifnar-deficient mice following MV infection was dependent on viral dose (48) . Morever, unrelated viruses that strongly induce a type I IFN response have been shown to be controlled by different profiles of ISGs specifically in the CNS (49) . It is possible, therefore, that survival in the absence of type I IFN signaling may be influenced in part by the kinetics of viral replication and spread, as well as the timing of the incoming adaptive immune response. Presumably, in our model, incoming IFN\u03b3-producing T cells are able to efficiently control infection in mice lacing type I IFNs. It will be of interest to determine whether the \u223c20% of Ifnar-deficient mice that succumb following infection die due to unrestricted infection, or whether neurons lacking type I IFN signaling are rendered hypersensitive to other cytokines, resulting in immune-mediated neuronal damage and loss. Some interferons are more effective against particular viruses, in part because distinct type I interferons engage the receptor with different affinity. For these studies, we chose IFN-beta because it is generally used as a \"representative\" IFN in the literature, though future efforts will look at differential type I IFN expression following infection, and outcomes following neuronal exposure.",
