In an exploratory analysis of the subset of more difficult-to-treat, Step 4-5 people with asthma (n = 27 IFN-b; n = 31 placebo), Asthma Control Questionnaire-6 increased significantly on placebo; this was prevented by IFN-b (P = 0.004).",

People with asthma are more likely to develop lower respiratory tract symptoms after an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) even though the frequency and severity of colds in people with asthma is not higher than normal (2) . Using culture of bronchial epithelial cells obtained by bronchoscopic brushings from corticosteroid-treated people with asthma, we have previously demonstrated that, when infected with rhinoviruses (RV), the asthmatic bronchial epithelium failed to mount an effective innate immune response involving IFN-b (6) and IFN-l (7) . Suboptimal activation of antiviral pathways resulted in greater viral replication and shedding, cytolysis of epithelial cells, and mediator release (6, 7) . A similar defect exists in asthmatic airway macrophages (8) and airway cells of children with asthma (9, 10) . Importantly, epithelial antiviral activity could be corrected ex vivo by low concentrations of exogenous IFN-b (6, 11) . Some other studies have been unable to replicate such differences between people with asthma and healthy individuals, but these were conducted in mild, corticosteroid-naive people with asthma (12) or in those with well-controlled asthma (13) .",

Based on a subsequent stepwise regression model, the daily asthma symptom score on treatment Day 2 (positive slope; the higher the score the greater the increase in ACQ-6) and the interaction between study treatment and BTS step seemed to have the most influence on the ACQ-6 change.

It is, in our view, a good example of translation of observations of enhanced innate immune responses from ex vivo studies (6) into proof of concept clinical studies. The study suggests that, when given at the time of reporting an URTI, inhaled IFN-b can ameliorate the way the airways of patients with asthma respond to viral infection. Although the trial did not show a positive effect on ACQ-6, the primary outcome, treatment with IFN-b, had a positive effect on morning lung function (PEF) and, in parallel, enhanced innate immunity both systemically and in the lungs as assessed by serum CXCL10 concentration and induction of genes for antiviral biomarkers CXCL10, Mx1, and OAS1 in induced sputum. This was associated with reduced proinflammatory cytokines in sputum and a trend toward reduced sputum RV load. Analysis of the moderate to severe people with asthma (Step 4 and 5 according to BTS guidelines) suggested a beneficial clinical effect of treatment, as shown by a mean 0.63 reduction in ACQ-6 score in patients treated with IFN-b (P = 0.004 as compared with those on placebo) that is widely viewed as being clinically significant. Genome-wide gene expression analysis using circulating blood cells from this subset of patients also showed that treatment with nebulized IFN-b enhanced systemic innate immunity.",

Furthermore, prespecified analysis (as stated in the statistical analysis plan) of patient subgroups, with asthma severity classified by BTS treatment step criteria (18, 21) , showed a significant protective effect of IFN-b in patients from BTS Steps 4-5 (i.e., those patients who require more intensive asthma maintenance treatment). The study, therefore, suggests that IFN-b treatment may be most appropriate for the more difficult to control people with asthma in whom the underlying disease process is likely to be more severe, thus requiring more intensive treatment, and in whom the risks of exacerbations, health impact, and treatment costs are greatest (24) . Asthma exacerbations are a major target for novel therapeutic agents, including such biologics as omalizumab (25) and mepolizumab (26) . Although effective at reducing exacerbations, these drugs are given long-term and systemically, and are pharmacodynamically unsuitable for acute administration. ICSs, the mainstay of asthma treatment, also reduce the rate of exacerbations, but doubling their dose at the onset of an exacerbation does not reduce the severity or rate of recovery of the exacerbation (27) . Thus, nebulized IFN-b treatment is the first therapy acting on the causal viral pathway that seems able to prevent worsening of asthma symptoms if administered shortly after patients become aware of a cold developing.",

Accordingly, measurement of the biomarker CXCL10 in serum and antiviral biomarkers in sputum cells (OAS1, Mx1, and CXCL10) demonstrated that inhaled IFN-b activated local antiviral defense mechanisms effectively at the dose and frequency selected for this trial while, at the same time, attenuating proinflammatory mediators, as judged by concentrations of CCL4 and CXCL8 measured in airway secretions (sputum). Additionally, IFN-b treatment resulted in a modest, but significant, induction of systemic innate immune responses as judged by the genome-wide gene expression analysis of blood cells, which showed significant differences in genes involved in type I IFN signaling. Together with the sustained and marked elevation of CXCL10 protein levels in blood, this suggests that treatment with IFN-b enhanced innate immunity, which in turn improved the clinical outcome of the cold. The trend toward reduced load of RV in sputum observed with treatment suggests that better antiviral defenses may result in faster clearance of RVs. Further studies, including analysis of other viruses, are required for more definitive proof.",

However, this was not significantly different to placebo and analysis of PEF data in this subgroup did not support a deleterious effect of IFN-b, mirroring the lack of IFN-b deficiency observed in vitro in mild patients (12) , although this treatment had a positive effect on both ACQ-6 and PEF in patients at BTS Step 4-5. Although the number of patients in the BTS Step 2 group was relatively small (15 placebo; 17 active), we cannot exclude the possibility that IFN-b treatment could have increased asthma symptoms in a small number of patients.",

The possible beneficial clinical effect of treatment seen in patients with moderate-severe asthma that was associated with this enhancement suggests that this treatment may impact favorably on cold-induced asthma exacerbations. The trial was designed and powered on the basis of the entire mITT patient population; therefore, further adequately powered studies focusing on more difficult-to-treat people with asthma are now needed to test the hypothesis that IFN-b is effective in this high-risk patient population. n",
