However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unclear. Here, we show that the absence of interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF-1) in genetic knock-out mice strongly abrogates pyroptosis in AMs and alleviates the LPS-induced lung injury and systemic inflammation. Our study demonstrates that IRF-1 contributes to caspase-1 activation and apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain pyroptosome formation in AMs and leads to downstream inflammatory cytokine release, including that of IL-1b, IL-18, and HMGB1. The nuclear translocation of IRF-1 is linked to the presence of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Our findings suggest that pyroptosis and the downstream inflammatory response in AMs induced by LPS is a process that is dependent on TLR4-mediated up-regulation of IRF-1. In summary, IRF-1 plays a key role in controlling caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis and inflammation.",

The mortality rates resulting from ALI/ARDS in intensive care units (ICUs) remain high at 30% to 40% (1) . Sepsis is one of the main risk factors for ARDS, and many animal models of sepsis have been developed to study ALI (2) . Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) models of inflammation have not reproduced the complex physiology of sepsis and our study focuses mainly on sepsisrelated ARDS. So identification of novel and effective therapeutic targets and approaches is vital if the outcomes in ARDS cases are to be improved. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) account for the 90% of the cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) (3) . In view of the role AMs as guardians for the alveolar-blood interface against airborne particles and microbes, their pivotal role in the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS has recently come under close scrutiny.",

Following oligomerization of inflammasome components, the nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), interacts with the adaptor molecule apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase activation and recruitment domain (ASC) through an N-terminal pyrindomain (PYD) domain. The caspase-recruitment domain of ASC then assembles to nucleate the polymerization and filament formation of pro-caspase-1, leading to its self-activation and proinflammatory cytokines release (IL-1b and IL-18) (6) . Inhibitors of cysteine protease caspase-1 have long been sought as a therapeutic tool because mice lacking caspase-1 are resistant to LPS-induced endotoxic shock (7) . A previous study conducted by our group observed caspase-1 activation in AMs during the development of ALI/ ARDS, and further, that treatment with a specific caspase-1 inhibitor has been shown to reduce LPS-induced lung injury in mice (8) . Caspase-1 activation in AM is thus closely related to the occurrence of ALI/ARDS. However, the mechanism modulating caspase-1 activation during pyroptosis remains unclear.",

In other experiments, mice were sacrificed 16 h post-LPS. Following euthanasia, the lungs (n \u00bc 6 per group) were excised from the mice via a median sternotomy. The wet weight (W) of the left lung was measured using an electronic scale and then desiccated in an oven at 658C for 72 h to determine the dry weight (D). The water content was measured by calculating W/D weight ratio. The right lung was removed and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. Lungs were instilled with 1 mL PBS each time through an intratracheal catheter as descried previously (17) , and lavaged >10 times by slowing withdrawing more than 0.8 mL lavage fluids each time. A total of 10 mL bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was withdrawn from each mouse. The 10 mL lavage fluid was centrifuged at 300 \u00c2 g for 10 min to pellet AMs. Another 2 mL BALF was harvested immediately following sacrifice from other mice to detect the total protein level and cytokine level in the BALF. Cytokine (IL-1b, IL-18, and HMGB1) concentrations from 2 mL BALF and serum were detected using relevant ELISA kits.",

It has already been established that caspase-1 is a biomarker of pyroptosis. We isolated the AMs from the ALI mouse model. As shown in Figure 1A , western blot analysis demonstrated that the protein levels of TLR4, IRF-1 (P <0.05), and caspase-1 increased in AMs after LPS administration. We also found that mRNA expression coding for TLR4 (Fig. 1B, P <0 .05), IRF-1 (Fig. 1B, P <0.05) , and caspase-1 (Fig. 1B, P <0 .05) were significantly higher when compared with the control group, a result that was consistent with our western blot analysis. To determine the levels of caspase-1 in the lung tissue, caspase-1 was detected in lung sections by immunohistochemistry staining. Higher expression levels of caspase-1 were observed in lung tissue from the ALI mouse model (Fig. 1C) . These results suggest that LPS does indeed induce TLR4 and IRF-1 expression and pyroptosis in alveolar macrophages in ALI.",

Significantly, LPS-induced mortality was 100% in the WT mice at 32 h, whereas all IRF-1 KO mice survived for 96 h postadministration ( Fig. 2A) . IRF-1 KO mice demonstrated significantly improved 96-h survival rates compared with the control WT mice (P <0.05). In a further set of experiments, four animal groups were created: WT/PBS group; WT/LPS group; IRF-1 KO/PBS group; and IRF-1 KO/LPS group. An examination of the pathology of the lung tissue showed that the WT/LPS group developed exacerbated lung inflammation, hemorrhaging and alveolar septal thickening, while lung lesions were fewer in the IRF-1 KO mice (Fig. 2B) . The level of total proteins in BALF (Fig. 2C , P <0.05), lung injury score (Fig. 2D , P <0.05), and pulmonary W/D weight ratio (Fig. 2E , P <0.05) significantly reduced in the IRF-1 KO/LPS group when compared with the WT/LPS group, which indicated that the lung injury in IRF-1 KO mice was alleviated. For cytokine levels both in serum and BALF, we discovered that IRF-1 deletion significantly blocked LPS-induced IL-18 ( well as IL-1b (Fig. 3C, P <0.05; Fig. 3D , P <0.05), and HMGB1 (Fig. 3E, P <0.05; Fig. 3F , P <0.05) compared with the WT/LPS group.

We showed that tissue-derived alveolar macrophages from LPS-stimulated IRF-1 KO mice exhibit less pyroptosis than their WT counterparts (Fig. 4A) . Furthermore, we found that overexpression of IRF-1 in J744.A1 cells alone is a sufficient stimulation to induce pyroptosis. Consequently, our data provides evidence that IRF-1 activation induces pyroptosis by modulating ASC pyroptosome formation and caspase-1 activation (Fig. 7) . Indeed, it has been shown that IRF-1 is an essential transcription factor involved in pyroptotic cell death. Previous studies have proved that the caspase-1 gene contains an IRF-1-binding element (IRE), and that caspase-1 expression cannot be up-regulated in oligodendrocyte progenitor cells stimulated by IFN without the presence of IRF-1 (22, 23) . IRF-1 can also induce the pyroptosis of oligodendrocyte in the development of multiple sclerosis, promote the inflammatory reaction, and lead to inflammatory demyelination (9) . The presence of IRE as a gene promoter of caspase-1 makes it possible that IRF-1 directly regulates caspase-1 activity and alveolar macrophage pyroptosis from the structure.",

However, the mechanism by which TLR4 mediates IRF-1 expression in AMs compromised by LPS remains to be elucidated. The myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) adaptor protein has been shown to recruit members of the IRF-1 family of transcription factors to evoke TLR target genes. Indeed, IRF-1 has been shown to be a participant in MyD88 signaling and migrates to the nucleus more effectively after stimulation with various TLR ligands (25) . Our experiments demonstrate that IRF-1 serves as a link between the initial upstream LPS-induced TLR4 signal and downstream pathological mechanisms by activating genes with propyroptotic functions.",

By identifying the molecular mechanisms of IRF-1-mediated caspase-1 signaling in macrophage pyroptosis and the associated inflammation, our study provides a novel therapeutic approach to management of ALI/ARDS.",
