The median viral load in posterior oropharyngeal saliva or other respiratory specimens at presentation was 5\u00b72 log 10 copies per mL (IQR 4\u00b71-7\u00b70). Salivary viral load was highest during the first week after symptom onset and subsequently declined with time (slope -0\u00b715, 95% CI -0\u00b719 to -0\u00b711; R\u00b2=0\u00b771). In one patient, viral RNA was detected 25 days after symptom onset. Older age was correlated with higher viral load (Spearman's \u03c1=0\u00b748, 95% CI 0\u00b7074-0\u00b775; p=0\u00b7020). For 16 patients with serum samples available 14 days or longer after symptom onset, rates of seropositivity were 94% for anti-NP IgG (n=15), 88% for anti-NP IgM (n=14), 100% for anti-RBD IgG (n=16), and 94% for anti-RBD IgM (n=15).

Unlike severe acute respiratory syndrome, patients with COVID-19 had the highest viral load near presentation, which could account for the fast-spreading nature of this epidemic.

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was first reported from China in December, 2019. 1 Although Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) 2 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 3 infections have a higher mortality rate than does COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 spreads much more rapidly than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Reliable data for profiles of serial viral load and serum antibody responses are needed urgently to guide antiviral treatment, infection control, epidemiological measures, and vaccination. The peak viral load of patients with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infections occurs at around 7-10 days after symptom onset, which could be associa ted with nosocomial outbreaks involving healthcare workers. 2, 4 Clinical studies of antiviral agents for SARS showed that the viral load decreased significantly with treatment success. 5 No systematic study of these two important variables with statistical analysis has been done for SARS-CoV-2, although preliminary descriptive studies have been reported. [6] [7] [8] In most studies of respiratory virus infections, serial sampling of nasopharyngeal or throat swabs is used for viral load monitoring. However, collection of nasopharyngeal or throat swab specimens can induce coughing and sneezing, which generates aerosol and is a potential health hazard for health-care workers. Collection of throat swabs also requires direct inspection of the patient's posterior pharynx and tonsils. Furthermore, collection of nasopharyngeal specimens is a relatively invasive procedure, which is uncomfortable and can even induce bleeding. A patient's reluctance to provide a sample can account for the paucity of timepoints in viral load studies of respiratory virus infections. Findings of previous studies have shown high concordance between saliva and nasopharyngeal aspirate as specimens for laboratory diagnosis of respi ratory viruses. 9 We have reported use of posterior oro pharyngeal (deep throat) saliva for diagnosis and viral load monitoring in a cohort of 12 patients with COVID-19. 6 Here, we report use of self-collected posterior oro pharyn geal saliva samples from patients with COVID-19, which avoids close contact between healthcare workers and patients, for viral load monitoring. We also monitored serial serum antibody levels of patients.",

For most patients, the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 was very high at presentation and declined steadily. Despite develop ment of antibodies against surface and internal proteins of SARS-CoV-2, viral RNA could still be detected in posterior oropharyngeal (deep throat) saliva samples from a third of patients for 20 days or longer. Peak viral load correlated positively with age. Most patients had an antibody response at 10 days or later after onset of symptoms. Viral whole-genome sequencing of paired samples from four patients did not identify any single nucleotide poly morphisms.",

            "text": "A high viral load on presentation of COVID-19 was recorded in our cohort, even for patients who were hospitalised shortly after symptom onset. Using nasal swab and throat swab, Zou and colleagues 8 have also reported a high viral load shortly after symptom onset. However, in that study, only cycle threshold values (not exact viral loads) were reported, and no statistical or correlative analysis was done with clinical variables such as age, comorbidities, disease severity, and antibody response. The viral load profile of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of influenza, which peaks at around the time of symptom onset, but contrasts with that of SARS-CoV at around 10 days and that of MERS-CoV at the second week after symptom onset. 4, 16, 17 The high viral load on presentation suggests that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted easily, even when symptoms are relatively mild. This finding could account for the efficient person-to-person transmission noted in community and health-care settings. Clusters in families, workplaces, religious gatherings, and food premises have been widely reported. 18 The viral load profile is important for guiding antiviral treatment. Since viral load had already peaked around the time of hospital admission, the risk of emergence of antiviral resistance could be similar to that of single-drug treatment of influenza by adamantanes, acid polymerase inhibitors, and neuraminidase inhibitors. However, our previous clinical trial of influenza treatment showed that a triple antiviral combination could significantly improve the clinical outcome and viral load profile and could reduce emergence of resistant virus quasispecies. 19 Currently, no standard treatment is available for Figure 3 : Relation between viral load and age or disease severity Correlation between age and peak viral load (A). Comparison of initial (B) and peak (C) viral load between severe and mild cases. Comparison of initial (D) and peak (E) viral load between patients with comorbidities and those without comorbidities. COVID-19. For SARS-CoV infection, our previous treatment study showed that a combination of lopinavirritonavir and ribavirin led to significantly fewer compli cations (eg, acute respiratory distress syndrome) or deaths than reported with historical controls treated with ribavirin. 5 Lopinavir-ritonavir or interferon beta 1b also reduced lung damage and decreased viral load in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV. 20 Lopinavir is a protease inhibitor with in-vitro activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. However, the idea that SARS-CoV 3C-like protease was the antiviral target of lopinavir was based purely on binding in computational modelling. 21 Other protease inhibitors and nucleotide analogues (eg, remdesivir [Gilead Sciences, Foster City, CA, USA]) are potential candidates for treatment. Combination treatment with virus-targeting and host-targeting agents to improve clinical outcome should be investigated. Studies for SARS-CoV have shown that a high initial viral load was associated with death. 22 However, our study only showed that the median viral load was 1 log 10 higher in severe cases than in mild cases, and the difference was not significant. But, older age was associated with a higher peak viral load. In a previous study of patients infected with SARS-CoV, older age was an independent factor associated with higher viral load, 23 as expected for immunosenescence, which impairs our innate and adaptive immune responses.",

Deceased patients infected with SARS-CoV developed faster peak anti-spike antibody responses when compared with patients who recovered 25 and had subsequent reduced B-cell immunity with impaired neutralising ability. In a SARS-CoV macaque model, anti-spike IgG stimulated pulmonary proinflammatory responses and caused acute lung injury. 26 The detrimental effect of antispike IgG was attributable to the effect on wound-healing macrophages, which was mediated via the Fc\u03b3 receptor.

The posterior oropharynx is the meeting point between secretions coming from the posterior nasopharynx and the salivary glands and respiratory secretions swept up from the tracheal-bronchial tree. Testing of saliva could show viral shedding from both the salivary glands and the upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, because of greater patient acceptability for posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples than for nasopharyngeal or throat swabs, we obtained 7\u00b75 respiratory specimens per patient for testing. Thus, our temporal viral load profile can be analysed by statistics, unlike previous clinical studies of viral kinetics of infections by highly pathogenic betacoronaviruses. 8, 16 Further studies are needed to ascertain whether the salivary glands can be infected by SARS-CoV-2.",

This limitation is a common problem in studies of emerging infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 16 The few patients enrolled does not allow for adjustment for potential confounding factors that could affect viral load or antibody response. Second, 48% of patients enrolled had chronic medical illness, which is a higher proportion than that reported in a large clinical series (24%). 30 Although a lower anti-RBD IgG level was noted among patients with comorbidities, further studies are warranted with more patients. Third, posterior oropharyngeal saliva samples cannot differentiate whether the virus is coming from the nasopharynx or from secretions from the lower respiratory tract; thus, our study cannot indicate whether SARS-CoV-2 has a predilection for both upper and lower respiratory tract. Moreover, some patients might not clear the throat effectively to cough out saliva from deep in the throat, which could decrease test sensitivity when compared with that of nasopharyngeal swabs, particularly in patients with predominant upper respiratory involvement or mild symptoms. Finally, the most abundantly expressed internal NP might have some cross-antigenicity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (90% amino acid homology) and, occasionally, OC43-CoV (38% amino acid homology). 31 Thus, the less abundantly expressed surface spike protein RBD, which is specific for SARS-CoV-2 and is the direct target for neutralising antibodies, was used to guard the specificity of our dual antibody assays. 32 COVID-19 is an emerging infection with many unknowns. This study has shed light on viral kinetics and antibody response in patients and provides scientific evidence for guiding infection control policies and therapeu tics. Further virological and immunological studies are needed to understand SARS-CoV-2 infection; infection control measures should be reviewed with the rapidly evolving epidemiology of COVID-19.",
