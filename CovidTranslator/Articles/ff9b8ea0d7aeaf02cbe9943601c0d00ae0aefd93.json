Singapore confirmed its first imported case of COVID-19 from Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020. 6 With the lockdown of Wuhan, inbound flights from Wuhan to Singapore had ceased since Jan 23, 2020. As of Feb 22, 2020, 89 people in Singapore were confirmed to have COVID-19, and the first 18 affected individuals all reported recent travel to Wuhan. Singapore identified several local clusters of COVID-19, with the first three linked to a tour group from China, a company conference, and a church.",

We used open source information from other countries (including government websites), news aggregators (eg, ProMed), and media reports to identify secondary transmissions in the respective clusters.

The local cases in cluster C were identified through enhanced pneumonia surveillance of people who had no history of travel to China, whereas the initial cases in cluster A were identified because of heightened suspicion by health-care workers, leading to testing. Among the first 84 confirmed cases in Singapore, ten were detected by enhanced pneumonia surveillance and testing of patients in intensive care units, and another eight affected individuals were detected based on doctors' discretion to test patients whom they viewed with suspicion for clinical or epidemiological reasons. Such surveillance systems are, therefore, important to identify cases in the commu nity who would be missed if the focus were only on travellers, and they have enabled prompt investigation and containment measures. Furthermore, with swift response in contact tracing and quarantine of close contacts, two close contacts developed symptoms and were confirmed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during their period of quarantine, ensuring no further onward transmission of the virus. Only two of 425 close contacts identified by contact tracing developed COVID-19 (ie, most cases identified in the clusters did not transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to their close contacts), raising the hypothesis that a few spreading events can result in clusters of transmission, whereas for most cases, transmission ended. The ease of international travel makes containment difficult. Cluster B was identified because of sharing of case data in Malaysia through the IHR focal point, and Singapore shared information on attendees at the company conference to respective IHR focal points where participants at the conference had originated. This work led to early identification of cases globally and highlights the importance of international cooperation and sharing of information under IHR to aid in active case-finding and containment.",
