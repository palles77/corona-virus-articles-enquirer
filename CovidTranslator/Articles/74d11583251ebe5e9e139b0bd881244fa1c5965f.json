            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCoV), a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus, is an important causative agent of neonatal diarrhoea in calves from beef and dairy cattle worldwide. The routine detection and diagnosis of BCoV have been mainly dependent on assays with low sensitivity. The aim of the present study was to develop and evaluate a semi-nested PCR (SN-PCR) to amplify a 251 bp fragment of BCoV N gene from fresh (n = 25) and frozen (n = 25) diarrhoeic faecal samples of naturally infected calves. To improve detection of BCoV in faecal samples by the SN-PCR an internal control was developed, and the results were compared with a conventional RT-PCR assay. The rates of positive samples by SN-PCR and RT-PCR were 24% (12/50) and 8% (4/50), respectively (K = 0.43). Only fresh samples were positive in RT-PCR while the SN-PCR detected BCoV in both fresh and frozen faecal samples. The sensitivity of SN-PCR was determined by 10-fold serial dilutions of the BCoV Kakegawa strain (HA titre: 256) that was detected until 10 \u22127 dilution. The specificity of the amplicons was assessed by restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analysis. The inclusion of an internal control provides a way to detect assay inhibition in faecal samples and failure of nucleic acid extraction that allow reduction of the number of false-negative results.",

Diarrhoea in calves is considered a multifactorial disease. Several environmental, managemental, nutritional and physiological factors may occur either alone or in synergy with the different infectious agents such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium sp., bovine group A rotavirus, calicivirus, torovirus and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) (Snodgrass et al., 1986; Duckmanton et al., 1998; Naciri et al., 1999; Van der Poel et al., 2000) . This emphasizes the difficulties in investigating and diagnosing the infectious aetiology of calf diarrhoea. Diarrhoea caused by BCoV is clinically important and the virus also infects the respiratory tract of cattle and has been associated with winter dysentery in adult cattle (Clark, 1993; Saif, 1990) .",

The virion contains five major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (N), the transmembrane protein (M), the hemaglutinin esterase protein (HE), the spike protein (S) and the small membrane protein (E). The N protein is a phosphoprotein of 50-60 kd that interacts with genomic RNA to form the viral nucleocapsid and may play a role in replication of viral RNA (Lapps et al., 1987; Clark, 1993) .",

However, due to the common presence of pleomorphic membranous structures similar to the coronavirus it may be difficult to recognize BCoV by EM (Saif, 1990) . Virus isolation in human rectal adenocarcinoma a long time to obtain conclusive results (Dea et al., 1980; Tahir et al., 1995; Kapil et al., 1996) . The haemagglutination (HA) test, performed directly with the faecal samples must be carefully interpreted since the faeces contain non-specific haemagglutinins providing false-positive results. The presence of colostral IgG1 and local IgA in faeces may also interfere with the HA results. The haemagglutination inhibition (HI) test is performed concurrently to improve the specificity of the HA test. Besides, another disadvantage of the HA/HI test is the need to maintain mouse colonies as sources of the fresh erythrocytes that are required for this diagnostic test (Sato et al., 1977; Kapil et al., 1999) . Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are probably the most widely used diagnostic test for BCoV although this test lacks sensitivity (Sato and Akashi, 1993; Tsunemitsu and Saif, 1995; Schoenthaler and Kapil, 1999; Silva et al., 1999) .",

Besides, there are no comparative studies on the ability of different primer sets to detect BCoV in clinical samples. Also, faeces remains the most difficult clinical sample for nucleic acid extraction and amplification due to the presence of PCR inhibitors that may yield false negative results (Monteiro et al., 1997) .

Careful primer design can aid PCR optimization and improve greatly the assay (Butler et al., 2001) . The SN-PCR primers possess very similar melting temperatures, with only two degrees of difference between them. Furthermore, only one primer-dimer formation was noted. Also of importance is the target region of BCoV RNA to be amplified. We chose the N gene because it is highly conserved among BCoV strains. It was concluded that the N protein is the most abundant antigen in coronavirus-infected cells because its RNA template is the smallest and it has the most abundant sgRNA (subgenomic RNA) during transcription (Hiscox et al., 2001) . This indicates that there is more available RNA for the N gene than for the other BCoV protein genes. Consequently, detection of the N gene RNA might be advantageous due to its high abundance in cells, facilitating a high sensitivity of the diagnostic technique. Tsunemtitsu et al. (1999) described the detection of BCoV RNA in faecal samples by RT-PCR and they also chose the N gene as target region for amplification. However, these authors worked with samples recently collected from experimentally inoculated adult cows while our BCoV positive results were obtained in faecal samples from calves with neonatal diarrhoea by natural infection. We tested the primers designed by Tsunemtitsu et al. (1999) (RT-PCR) to compare the efficiency of the amplification in frozen and fresh samples from naturally infected calves. Although it was efficient for amplification of the positive control (Kakegawa strain), the same was not noted for clinical samples. The presence of unspecific amplicons and smears or failure to amplify the expected product disabled the diagnostic use. No absolute rules could be established to predict the ability of a primer pair to faithfully amplify a specific gene. However, the difference in detection rate may be the result of primer design. Analysis of the RT-PCR primers disclosed dimers and internal loop formation, palindrome sequences and different melting temperatures between the primers that can be related to the bad quality of the amplified products.",

Four RNA extraction methods (TRIzol TM , phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol, guanidinium isothiocyanate, and a combination of phenol/chloroform/ isoamyl alcohol and silica/guanidinium isothiocyanate) were tested and compared for BCoV detection in faecal samples. SN-PCR detection rates after RNA extraction using the combination of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and silica/guanidinium isothiocyanate methods were better than after other RNA extraction protocols (data not shown). The combination of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and silica/guanidinium isothiocyanate methods was performed according to Barreiros et al. (2004) with slight modifications. Faecal samples remain the most difficult specimens for nucleic acid extraction and amplification due the presence of inhibitors (Monteiro et al., 1997) . Guanidinium isothiocyanate alone or in combination with phenol-chloroform inactivates ribonucleases and therefore improves the stability of the extracted RNA genome (Romero, 1999) . Van der Hoek et al. (1995) , Hale et al. (1996) , Rassol et al. (2002) , Paula et al. (2003) also demonstrated that the guanidinium isothiocyanate method successfully removed inhibitors from faecal samples.",

However, the real frequency of the BCoV in neonatal calf diarrhoea outbreaks depends of the diagnostic technique. Cho et al. (2001) showed that nested PCR was 5000 times more sensitive than the antigen-capture ELISA. Therefore, the applicability of a sensitive technique such as PCR is fundamental to not underestimating the real prevalence of BCoV. Cho et al. (2001) also described a second round of amplification with the same primers described by Tsunemtitsu et al. (1999) . However, this primer pair was tested only in fresh samples from experimentally infected calves and without an internal control.",

Differences in the ability to amplify and the characteris-tics of the PCR systems available for BCoV detection in clinical samples should be considered before use a test in future epidemiological studies. The rate of 24% positive diarrhoeic faecal samples confirms that the BCoV is an important etiological agent of neonatal diarrhoea in dairy and beef Brazilian cattle herds. The availability of a sensitive and specific diagnostic technique such as the SN-PCR described in this work will make it possible to undertake larger epidemiological studies of BCoV involved in the neonatal calf diarrhoea aetiology.",
