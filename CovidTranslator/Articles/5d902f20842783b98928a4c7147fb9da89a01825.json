The assumption is that the relative abundances of the amplified RNAs will reflect the biological state of the source, just as the endogenous RNA abundances do. To avoid systematic errors of uneven amplification of different RNAs that can occur with exponential amplification procedures (where error is also exponentially amplified), scientists developed linear nucleic acid amplification. Linear RNA amplification is an isothermal nucleic acid amplification system that rapidly amplifies target RNA populations. There are two primary linear amplification procedures in use today: linear aRNA amplification and rolling circle amplification. In this Perspective we concentrate on how the aRNA amplification methodology has been developed for a host of chemical analyses, so no further discussion of rolling circle amplification ensues.",

            "text": "Linear aRNA amplification is in vitro RNA-transcription-mediated amplification, and is also referred to as amplified RNA or simply aRNA. This technique was first developed and published in 1990 (ref. 2) as a method to amplify RNA populations, but since then it has been used for a number of other applications. In this procedure, Van Gelder et al. 2 first used reverse transcription to create a cDNA copy of the RNA template, incorporating an RNA polymerase promoter into each cDNA molecule by priming cDNA synthesis with a synthetic oligonucleotide (oligo(dT)-T7) that contained a poly(T) and phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The poly(T) portion of the primer is used to select for mRNA species that contain a poly(A) tail, and the T7 promoter portion of the primer is used to direct T7 polymerase to bind to the promoter and synthesize an RNA copy of the cDNA template. This Over the past ~25 years, particular emphasis has been placed on understanding the transcriptome of cells, with the knowledge that the fundamental player in converting genomic information into biological function is RNA. Whether translated into protein or functioning in a regulatory manner, RNAs underlie many aspects of cellular function, and it has become clear that their dysregulation is associated with various diseases. Understanding RNA biology requires detection, quantification, and sequencespecific characterization of the composite RNAs. The technical evolution of cell biology methods has resulted in the relatively easy analysis of RNA populations from organs and tissues where there are large amounts of RNA. However, transcriptomics analyses become problematic when smaller amounts of tissue, such as punch biopsies, are used for human diagnosis, or in examinations of individual single cells where RNA is present in small amounts and needs to be amplified to levels that can be experimentally analyzed.",

One way to detect such low-abundance RNAs is to amplify their numbers.

Whereas most molecular biology techniques are rapidly replaced owing to the fast-moving nature of development in the field, the aRNA procedure has become a base that can be built upon through varied uses of the technology. The technique was originally developed to assess RNA populations from small amounts of starting material, including single cells, but over time its use has evolved to include the detection of various cellular entities such as proteins, RNA-binding-protein-associated cargoes, and genomic DNA. In this Perspective we detail the linear aRNA amplification procedure and its use in assessing various components of a cell's chemical phenotype. This procedure is particularly useful in efforts to multiplex the simultaneous detection of various cellular processes. These efforts are necessary to identify the quantitative chemical phenotype of cells that underlies cellular function.",

After the second round, >1 \u00d7 10 6 -fold RNA amplification can be achieved 3 , which is adequate for the generation of microarray probes 4 or a sequencing library 4, 5 . This procedure has proven useful for amplification of RNA from single cells, which contain only ~10 picograms of total RNA [6] [7] [8] . Examination of expression profiles of single live cells has shown that linear aRNA amplification neither results in occurs after synthesis of double-stranded cDNA, when T7 RNA polymerase is added and aRNA is transcribed from the cDNA template. There is then a second round of amplification, in which aRNA is amplified through conversion of aRNA into cDNA, with random hexanucleotide primers used to intitiate cDNA synthesis. Random primers are used because of their random annealing property, which allows them to prime any RNA species for reverse transcription into cDNA. The oligo(dT)-T7 primer serves as a primer for second-strand cDNA synthesis, in which the T7 promoter is added to the double-stranded cDNA at the end of the second round, thereby allowing subsequent second-round aRNA In the first round, first-strand cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription (RT) is primed from mRNA after oligo(dT)-T7 primer anneals to the poly(A) tail of mRNA. RNase H is then used to digest portions of the bound mRNA to create RNA fragments that serve to prime second-strand cDNA by DNA polymerase (pol). Finally, aRNA is amplified via linear in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase, using the T7 RNA polymerase promoter incorporated in the double-stranded cDNA. In the second round, first-strand synthesis is primed by random primers instead of the oligo(dT)-T7 primer by reverse transcriptase using the aRNA as a template instead of mRNA. After RNA denaturation, second-strand synthesis is primed with the oligo(dT)-T7 primer, which binds to the poly(A) tail of the cDNA created during first-strand synthesis by DNA polymerase. Finally, RNA is again linearly amplified through the enzymatic activity of T7 RNA polymerase acting on its promoter that is incorporated into the double-stranded cDNA 2,3 . Credit: Marina Spence/Springer Nature. After two rounds of linear aRNA amplification from isolated single cells, an Illumina TruSeq library is generated as outlined. Because of the short length of the aRNA amplified by the procedure, the step that breaks long RNA into smaller parts in the original Illumina library protocol can be omitted. For strand specificity, deoxyuridine triphosphate is incorporated into the second-strand cDNA. After sequencing adaptor ligation, the cDNA fragments with adaptors at both end are PCR amplified, and ready for sequencing 7, 8 . (b) RNA-binding protein (RBP)/RNA cargo detection (APRA). An antibody (Ab) to RBP is conjugated to an oligonucleotide and applied to fixed cells. After antibody-RBP binding, the oligonucleotide (containing the T7 promoter sequence) is positioned closely enough to the RNA to prime first-strand cDNA synthesis in situ. After second-strand synthesis in vitro, the antibody is removed by restriction enzyme cleavage and the aRNA is linearly amplified by in vitro transcription using the T7 promoter incorporated in the cDNA. The aRNA product is suitable for PCR, microarray, and next-generation sequencing analysis 43 . (c) Protein detection (IDAT). A detection antibody is first generated by conjugation of a target-protein-specific antibody to a double-stranded (ds) oligonucleotide containing T7 promoter. In a 96-well plate, a capture antibody then binds to the antigen (Ag) of interest from a sample. After the addition of detection antibody to the sample, RNA is linearly amplified by T7 RNA polymerase from the double-stranded oligonucleotide template incorporating the T7 promoter. The amount of RNA product is indicative of the original amount of antigen in the sample and can be used for fluorimeter detection, PCR. or sequencing 45 . (d) Whole-genome DNA amplification (LIANTI). A LIANTI transposon is first created by joining of the T7 promoter site to a transposase-binding site. This transposon is then mixed with transposase to generate the LIANTI transposome. After the LIANTI transposome is mixed with DNA isolated from single cells, the transposase mediates random insertion of LIANTI transposon into the DNA and subsequent excision of genomic DNA, which is followed by DNA polymerase gap extension. After the addition of T7 RNA polymerase, single-stranded aRNA is generated that is capable of self-priming on the 3\u2032 end. After reverse transcription, RNase treatment, and second-strand synthesis, double-stranded LIANTI amplicons tagged with unique molecular barcodes are formed and ready for DNA library preparation and next-generation sequencing 11 voltage-clamp techniques. Using RNA deep sequencing, the same group also detected more than 12,000 expressed genes in primary cells from live neurosurgically resected adult human brains, uncovering cell-type-specific and patient-specific transcriptional hierarchies 7 .",

Its most prominent application has been to identify biomarkers, but it is also used to identify potential therapeutic targets. In many of the disease-associated studies, commercially available versions of the linear amplification technology have been used under trademarked names, including RiboAmp (Thermo), AmpliScribe (Epicentre), and MEGAscript (Invitrogen). Because aRNA is cell-type agnostic, it can be used in a variety of diseaseassociated cell types. For example, the transcriptome of platelets isolated from people with sickle cell disease 27 has highlighted the role of metabolic pathways in the disease. Transcriptomic insights into brain diseases such as schizophrenia 28 , depression 29 , Parkinson's disease 30 , Alzheimer's disease 31 , and even brain microvascular injury have provided many disease-associated targets for further analysis. The study of cancer has benefited preferential amplification of certain RNA species (i.e., it shows no sequence preference) nor creates significant differences in the ratios of specific aRNAs in the amplified RNA population compared with those of the initial host cell mRNA abundances 3,9 . It should be noted that if there were bias in amplification, then the bias would be linearly amplified rather than exponentially as in PCR amplification. Furthermore, aRNA has been shown to provide an accurate and precise amplification product [9] [10] [11] [12] . aRNA has been used extensively to generate probes for northern and Southern blotting, in tandem with PCR 13,14 and microarrays 4, 12, 15, 16 , and for sequencing of tissue-isolated RNA 7,10,17,18 .",

The linear aRNA reporting system, however, provides an opportunity to detect multiple biological entities in a single sample without specific isolation. This eliminates sample loss while harmonizing the detection output; because the RNA-polymerase-promoter-containing DNAs from the different detectors are transcribed, the resultant aRNAs can be used to deduce the proteome or other chemicals on the basis of the specific barcodes that are detected. For example, it may be possible to use APRA to detect specific RBP-associated RNA cargoes with unique barcodes in the same cell where the transcriptome is analyzed (both will be linearly amplified, but they will be distinct and distinguishable on the basis of different sets of barcodes). This would facilitate analysis of the dynamics of RNA movement between different subcellular compartments. As another example, when coupled with the use of antibodies to specific post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or glycosylation groups, IDAT could be used to assess the biology and dynamics of such protein modifications at the same time as the transcriptome analysis. Careful use of barcodes in LIANTIbased DNA sequencing in conjunction with analysis of the transcriptome (using a distinctly barcoded oligo(dT)-T7 primer to prime amplification of the poly(A) RNA population) would allow analysis of both genomic DNA and the transcriptome in the same cell. One could take this even further by multiplexing more than two of these analysis procedures. For example, the transcriptome (assessed via the aRNA procedure), genomic DNA (analyzed by LIANTI), and protein (evaluated by IDAT) could all be analyzed in the same cell. Such combinatorial use of aRNA-amplificationbased methods should enable the quantitative analysis of many cellular components and their associated biologies from a single sample, down to and including subregions of a single cell. Given the flexibility of the technique and the ability of different aRNA reporting methods to barcode different chemicals, it is reasonable to presume that linear RNA amplification will continue to be used as a foundation for new technologies, providing deeper understanding of the multiple components and processes of cells and systems that contribute to their function.",

            "text": "The ability to detect antigens immunologically is often limited by the low affinity of many antibodies, the limiting amount of many antigens, and the high background often associated with highsensitivity enzymatic or fluorescence detection methods. These issues can be overcome through the use of aRNA amplification for antigen detection rather than the standard fluorescence detection, as the protein-detection sensitivity can be increased ~10 9 -fold over that of conventional ELISA methods. This aRNA proteindetection technique is termed immunodetection amplified by T7 RNA polymerase (IDAT) (Fig. 2c) . Zhang et al. 45 developed a method to facilitate aRNA detection of antibody-antigen interactions by covalently attaching a double-stranded cDNA that contains a T7 RNA polymerase promoter in front of a reporter sequence to a specific antibody. After immunostaining with the IDAT antibody, RNA polymerase is added to the antigenantibody complex to linearly amplify RNA from the cDNA that is conjugated to the antibody. Because the amplification is linear, the yield of aRNA is a direct measure of the amount of antibodyantigen interaction. A fluorescence-based modification of IDAT subsequently developed by the same group, termed fluorescent amplification catalyzed by T7 polymerase technique (FACTT), was successfully used to analyze low-abundance oncogene proteins in human serum 46 . Rather than using chemical crosslinking of the amplification primer to the antibody, FACTT uses streptavidin-labeled antibodies to bind the biotinylated amplification target sequence. Because streptavidin binds many biotinylated molecules with higher affinity than antibody-antigen binding, the sensitivity of FACTT is greater than that of IDAT. RiboGreen, a fluorescent RNA intercalating dye, can be used to quantify the yield of amplified RNA. IDAT and FACTT should be adaptable to automation and high-throughput protein screening.",

Quantitation of the subcellular components and processes that give rise to cellular functions such as genomic DNA sequence variation, gene expression, methylation, and the creation of metabolites and proteins will improve the overall understanding of hierarchical cellular regulation and allow the construction of an 'architecture of cellular phenotype' . Such an architecture would enable the codetermination of genomic DNA sequence and expression state, as well as allow RNA and protein abundances to complement each other, with variations in dynamics and absolute and relative amounts of each cellular chemical resulting in specific celltype designations. This will be possible only when all of these cellular constituents can be quantified in the same sample. The easy adaptation of the aRNA procedure to the analysis of different subcellular chemicals and biologies as illustrated above gives rise to the possibility of using this methodology in a multiplexed manner to simultaneously analyze multiple subcellular chemicals within a cell. Such multiplexing is currently possible for two chemicals at a time (for example, transcriptome and protein analysis), but adding further levels of analysis",
