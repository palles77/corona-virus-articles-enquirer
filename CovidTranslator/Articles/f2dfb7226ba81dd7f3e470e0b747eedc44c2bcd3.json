Previous work demonstrated that MV was transmitted trans-synaptically, and that, while a cellular receptor for the hemagglutinin (H) protein was required for MV entry, it was dispensable for subsequent cell-to-cell spread. Here, we explored what role the other envelope protein, fusion (F), played in trans-synaptic transport. We made the following observations: 1) MV-F expression in infected neurons was similar to that seen in infected fibroblasts; 2) fusion inhibitory peptide (FIP), an inhibitor of MV fusion, prevented both infection and spread in primary neurons; 3) Substance P, a neurotransmitter with the same active site as FIP, also blocked neuronal MV spread; and 4) both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of the Substance P receptor, neurokinin-1 (NK-1), reduced infection of susceptible mice. Together, these data implicate a role for NK-1 in MV CNS infection and spread, perhaps serving as a MVF receptor or co-receptor on neurons.",

Subsequent challenge of NSE-CD46 transgenic mice with the vaccine strain, MV-Edmonston, by either the intracerebral or intranasal route resulted in infection in all transgenic mice. While adult immunocompetent mice resolved the infection, both CD46 + neonates and immunodeficient (e.g., RAG knockout (KO)) CD46 + adults developed CNS disease resulting from unrestricted neuronal infection (Lawrence et al., 1999; Rall et al., 1997) .",

            "text": "Based on this observation, we next wanted to establish what role, if any, the viral fusion protein played in trans-synaptic transport. While it is generally believed that H and F have interaction domains that coordinate receptor binding and fusion (Hu, Ray, and Compans, 1992) , work by other laboratories has suggested that F may act independently of H, and may even govern target cell specificity. For example, in simian virus 5 (SV5), F promotes fusion in the absence of the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, albeit less efficiently than when HN is present (Horvath et al., 1992; Ito et al., 1997) . Moreover, SV5 F protein mutants that require SV5 HN for fusion at 37\u00b0C can fuse in an HN-independent manner at higher temperatures. Thus, fusion may require surmounting a thermodynamic threshold, which can be accomplished by a conformational change in the HN protein, increased temperature, or perhaps interaction of the F protein with its own cellular receptor (Dutch et al., 2001; Paterson, Russell, and Lamb, 2000) . This final possibility has support in the literature, since the F 2 fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a Pneumovirus within the Paramyxovirus family, determines host cell tropism (Schendler et al., 2003) , and recombinant RSV particles lacking the G protein remained viable and able to spread (Techaarpornkul, Barretto, and Peeples, 2001) .",

The tri-peptide sequence of FIP (Phe-Phe-Gly) is identical to the active site of the neurotransmitter Substance P ( Figure 4A ), which can also inhibit MV spread in non-neuronal cultures (Harrowe, Mitsuhashi, and Payan, 1990; Schroeder, 1986) . Substance P transduces signals to target cells by engagement of the neurotachykinin family of G protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors, including neurokinin-1 (NK-1) (Gerard et al., 1991; Schaffer et al., 1998) , a highly conserved protein expressed on diverse mammalian cells, including neurons, lymphocytes, smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelium (Pennefather et al., 2004) . NK-1 expression is not ubiquitous within the CNS, though most central structures display some expression (Mantyh, 2002) . In neurons, NK-1 is broadly distributed on the plasma membrane, though concentrated at the synapse (Bozic et al., 1996) . Here, we show that both FIP and Substance P prevent MV spread in neurons, and that both genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of NK-1 also reduce infection of permissive mice. Together, these data indicate that fusion is a required step for viral transport across the synaptic cleft, and suggest that NK-1 plays a key role in this process, perhaps serving as a MV-F receptor.",

For the mock-infected controls, an amount of lysate corresponding to 10 5 cells was used. MV-F is synthesized as a precursor (F 0 ) that is post-translationally cleaved into two subunits, F 1 and F 2 .

In our hands, however, addition of FIP prior to viral challenge did not prevent infection of Vero cells ( Figure 3D ), though subsequent viral spread was blocked ( Figure 3E and F). The suppressive effect of FIP was reversible: when FIP was washed out of the cultures at 3 dpi, MV rebounded rapidly, resulting in the same cytopathicity and syncytia formation as observed in untreated cultures (compare Figure 3G and 3C). In contrast, pretreatment of CD46 + neurons with FIP completely blocked infection ( Figure 3K -M), and, as expected, FIP washout did not result in MV re-emergence ( Figure 3N ). The inability of FIP to block infection of Veros could be due to cell-specific differences in receptor density, distribution (or utilization) of putative fusion receptors (discussed below), or access of FIP to cell surfaces. Taken together, these data indicate that FIP can prevent both infection and spread in primary CD46 + mouse hippocampal neurons.",

Two strategies were used: genetic knockout mice ( Figure 5 ) and pharmacological NK-1 inhibitors ( Figure 6 ). NK-1 knockout (NK-1 KO) mice (Bozic et al., 1996) were intercrossed with NSE-CD46 + homozygous mice to obtain NSE-CD46 + /NK-1 KO mice. As reported in the original characterization, NK-1 KO mice show no apparent developmental abnormalities with regard to lifespan, fertility, fecundity, or brain anatomy (Bozic, et al., 1996) . All mice were genotyped for CD46 and NK-1 status, as described in Materials and Methods. Because neonatal CD46 + mice (that are also NK-1 + ) succumb to MV-mediated CNS disease following viral challenge (Lawrence et al., 1999; Rall et al., 1997) , we asked what impact genetic deletion of NK-1 would have on MV neuronal infection and resultant pathogenesis in the neonatal model. As previously shown, MV-infected control CD46 + /NK-1 + neonates (black triangles) developed symptoms within 4-8 dpi and died 1-2 days thereafter ( Figure 5A ). In contrast, CD46 + /NK-1 KO neonates (black circles) either showed no signs of illness through adulthood, or developed illness at a much later time (18 dpi in 35% of CD46 + /NK-1 KO neonates vs. 5-9 dpi in 100% of CD46 + / NK-1 + neonates)( Figure 5A ). None of the surviving CD46 + /NK-1 KO mice showed evidence of MV CNS infection by RT-PCR analysis; in contrast, MV antigens were observed in all moribund CD46 + /NK-1 KO mice collected at 18 dpi (data not shown). As expected, CD46-/ NK-1 + mice (white circles) were non-permissive for infection and showed no signs of illness or infection at any timepoint, indicating that NK-1 alone cannot mediate MV entry.",

Detection of the MV-N gene by RT-PCR analysis of total brain RNA showed evidence of replication in 4/4 (100%) CD46 + /NK-1 + mice, whereas only 2/11 (18%) CD46 + /NK-1 KO mice were positive ( Figure  5B ).

Unlike the genetic knockout studies described above, neonates could not be used for the aprepitant studies because of the technical obstacle of oral drug delivery to neonatal mice. Thus, CD46 + adult mice on a RAG-2 KO background were used: these mice, which lack mature T and B cells, cannot resolve a MV challenge and virtually 100% become moribund between 10-14 dpi (Lawrence et al., 1999) . As shown in Figure 6A , all MV-inoculated CD46 + /RAG-2 KO mice that did not receive aprepitant showed an average weight loss of 15% and an average illness score of 3.4 (obtained between days 6-10) prior to sacrifice. In contrast, aprepitant-treated CD46 + /RAG-2 KO mice segregated into two populations: those that developed neuropathology, and those that did not. In the representative experiment shown, 14/25 mice developed a milder illness than non-aprepitant treated controls (2.1 vs. 3.4), and weight loss in these mice was less, averaging 5%. Importantly, 11/25 MVchallenged mice treated with aprepitant showed no signs of illness or weight loss. RT-PCR analysis of purified total brain RNA confirmed the absence of MV-N RNA in brains of healthy aprepitant-treated mice (data not shown).",

No evidence of MV infection within the CNS was observed in healthy mice that received aprepitant ( Figure 6B (g-i) ). Taken together, the results from both the drug and knockout experiments indicate that NK-1, a receptor for the neurotransmitter Substance P, plays a crucial role in MV spread.

Indeed, all neurotachykinins blocked spread, a process that appeared to depend, at least in part, on the presence of the neurotachykinin receptor, NK-1. The majority of NK-1 deficient neonates, as well as NK-1 + adults mice treated with the specific antagonist, aprepitant, survived viral challenge without any symptoms of disease or viral replication in the CNS. Thus, we speculate that NK-1 may promote MV entry into CD46 + neurons by serving as a docking receptor for the MV-F protein, and that the ability of FIP and Substance P to block infection and spread may be due to competitive inhibition with the NK-1 receptor, a hypothesis currently under study in our laboratory.",

MV-Ed trans-synaptic spread can occur in the absence of CD46, and primary mouse neurons do not express the other identified MV receptor, SLAM/CD150w. While these data indicate that trans-synaptic spread may not require a receptor for the H protein, we cannot rule out the possibility that a protein expressed at the post-synaptic membrane may serve as a unique H-receptor in neurons, specifically facilitating neuron-to-neuron transport across synapses. However, given the similarity in sequence and activity of Substance P and the fusion inhibitor FIP, we favor the idea that F, through binding to neurokinin receptors, facilitates transport of MV RNPs across the synapse in the absence of a need for H. Importantly, NK-1 is expressed in all mammals and on virtually all cells, including the Vero fibroblasts used as controls in our experiments (data not shown). Thus, we are also currently testing whether NK-1 is a necessary co-factor for MV entry into all permissive cells.

This inability could be explained by: a) an insufficient concentration of these inhibitors at the synaptic membrane; b) a rapid offrate of Substance P from NK-1 (Sarntinoranont, Iadarola, and Morrison, 2003) and/or c) the potential for MV-F to utilize multiple neurokinin receptors, including NK-2 and NK-3, for entry. Because all three neurotachykinins inhibited MV spread to some degree ( Figure 4B ), and each serves as the ligand for three different neurokinin receptors, it remains possible that the other neurokinin receptors, NK-2 and NK-3, may serve as surrogates for MV entry under circumstances in which NK-1 is not present or active.",

The F protein of bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), a member of the Paramyxovirus family, is posttranslationally cleaved twice, unlike MV-F, which is cleaved once. The small peptide that is released from BRSV-F cleavage is converted to a biologically active tachykinin, called virokinin . This soluble, virus-encoded peptide interacts with NK-1 and triggers the same downstream pathways as the bona fide ligand, Substance P. Thus, fusion proteins or post-translationally cleaved products derived from the fusion proteins of multiple Paramyxoviruses appear to interact with neurokinin receptors, though the benefit such an interaction confers to the virus is not yet understood.",

In the NSE-CD46 mouse model of neuronal MV infection, CNS disease occurs in infected, immunodeficient animals in the absence of neuronal death (Patterson et al., 2002) , suggesting that CNS disease in this mouse model is due to neuronal dysfunction rather than overt cell loss. We hypothesize that MV-mediated fusion of neuronal synapses could promote neuropathology through a number of possible mechanisms, including constitutive neurotransmitter signaling or loss of synaptic integrity. Continued use of this model system will allow us to determine how receptor interactions may contribute to neuropathology, and may identify novel candidates for antiviral therapies to prevent or limit MV-induced neuropathology in humans.",
