However, its clinical use has been limited by severe toxicity, associated primarily with systemic administration with excess protein distributing freely throughout the body. We hypothesized that rhIL-2 in alternate forms permitting more restricted localization may exert stronger antitumor efficacy and less toxicity. Here, we have tested the utility of palmitate-derivatized rhIL-2. rhIL-2 was reacted with N-hydroxysuccinimide palmitate ester. The resultant lipidated rhIL-2 (pIL-2), when mixed with cells, could spontaneously transfer from solution to cell surfaces. Next, anticancer efficacy of pIL-2 was assessed in two modalities. For adoptive T cell therapy, antitumor cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) were protein transferred (\"painted\") with pIL-2 and injected into mice bearing lymphoma. For in situ therapy, pIL-2 was injected intratumorally into mice bearing melanoma. Tumor growth and IL-2-associated toxicity were determined.",

Moreover, while repeated intratumoral injection of rhIL-2 at an excessively high dose (10 injections of 10000 IU/mouse) caused marked vascular leakage syndrome, the same regimen using pIL-2 caused no detectable toxicity.",

One of the major utilities of rhIL-2 is in adoptive cell therapy, where rhIL-2 is injected systemically to patients to prolong the survival of transfused therapeutic T cells, which are raised with IL-2 ex vivo and thus become IL-2-dependent in vivo (20) . We hypothesized that directly \"painting\" pIL-2 onto the T cells may increase their survival while bypassing the need for systemic IL-2 injection and its associated toxicities. To test this, OT-1 T cells were activated with anti-CD3 mAb and expanded with murine IL-2 for 4 days in culture. The T cells were then incubated with 50 ng of pIL-2 for 10 min, washed, and re-plated in IL-2-free medium; as controls, non-painted T cells were re-plated in IL-2-free medium or medium containing 50 ng of rhIL-2 (positive control). Live cells were then counted daily by flow cytometry. The results showed that the non-painted T cells died off in 6 and 3 days with and without rhIL-2, respectively (Fig. 2a) . In contrast, the pIL-2-painted T cells proliferated for 3 days, resulting in a larger T cell population after 6 days than at baseline. This indicates that pIL-2 painting of the T cells prolongs their viability ex vivo. To determine whether this is also the case in vivo, pIL-2-painted OT-1 T cells were adoptively transferred into C57BL/6 mice. As controls for painting, T cells mock-painted with rhIL-2 were similarly transferred. To control for the number of cells injected, the pIL-2 painted or mock-painted T cells were labeled with a green fluorescent dye (CFSE) and transferred together with the same number of non-painted OT-1 T cells labeled with a red dye (SNARF-1). Three days later, the total cellular content of the draining lymph node in all groups was analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 2b , the number of the mock-painted T cells was about the same as that of the non-painted T cells, whereas the number of the pIL-2-painted T cells was about 2.5-fold of that of non-painted T cells (p = 0.02). Moreover, the gain in cell number was accompanied by reduction in the cells' CFSE intensity (Fig. 2b) , indicating in vivo proliferation (8) of the pIL-2-painted T cells. Collectively, these results indicate that pIL-2 painting of T cells increases not only their survival but also their expansion in vivo, upon adoptive transfer.",

This tumor line expresses hen ovalbumin as a pseudo tumor antigen, which is specifically recognized by the OT-1 T cells (6) . The cell mixtures were injected intradermally into the back flank of syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. The result showed that on a per cell basis, the pIL-2-painted T cells were at least 3 times more potent than the non-painted control T cells in inhibiting tumor growth (Fig. 2c) .

Neither was it attributed to inactivation of pIL-2, as pIL-2 effectively inhibited tumor growth (p = 0.03) (Fig. 4b) , which was consistent with the stronger antitumor effect of pIL-2 shown in Fig. 3 , a&b.

            "text": "In conclusion, we have generated pIL-2, a new form of rhIL-2 that can spontaneously incorporate itself onto cell surfaces. In both adoptive T cell transfer and in situ therapies, pIL-2 shows stronger antitumor efficacy than rhIL-2. Furthermore, when injected directly into tumor tissue, pIL-2 causes less toxicity than rhIL-2, likely because of localized retention of pIL-2 upon its incorporation onto the cells. Hence, pIL-2 may potentially serve as a useful alternative IL-2 therapy for treating cancer. To that end, future work will be needed to demonstrate pharmacokinetics about this alternate form of the cytokine, as well as the pharmacodynamic interaction between pIL-2-bound T cells and other immune cells. It is also conceivable that the approach established here may be used to derivatize other cytokines, such as IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, to generate more effective and less toxic cytokine drugs for cancer. Painting of T cells with pIL-2 enhances their survival and antitumor efficacy in adoptive transfer therapy. (a) OT-1 cells were activated and expanded ex vivo for 4 days. The day-4 cells (5 \u00d7 10 6 cells) were thoroughly washed, painted with 50 ng of pIL-2, washed again, and re-plated in 5 ml of IL-2-free medium. As controls, an equal number of non-painted day-4 cells were re-plated in 5 ml of IL-2-free medium (negative control) or medium containing 50 ng (500 IU) of rhIL-2 (positive control). Samples were taken daily, stained with 7-AAD, and live (7-AAD \u2212 ) cells were counted by flow cytometry. Shown is 1 of 2 experiments with similar results. (b) The day-4 cells (from A) were labeled with CFSE or SNARF-1. The CFSE-labeled cells were painted with pIL-2, mock-painted with hIL-2, or non-painted (NT); subsequently, they were co-injected with an equal number of non-painted, SNARF-1-labeled cells at a footpad. Three days later, survival of the donor cells in the popliteal lymph node was analyzed by flow cytometry. CD8 + cells were gated. The dot plots show 1 of 3 experiments with similar results; the bar graph shows the combined results from all 3 experiments. *, p = 0.04; **, p = 0.02. (c) Non-painted or pIL-2-painted day-4 cells (from A) were mixed with 1 \u00d7 10 6 E.G7-OVA tumor cells at the indicated ratio and subsequently injected intradermally into C57BL/6 mice (n = 4). Growth of tumor was followed weekly. Shown is 1 of 2 experiments with similar results. Dot, tumor cells injected alone; circle, tumor cells injected with T cells. In situ therapy with pIL-2 leads to effective antitumor responses. (a) Melanoma was inoculated on day 0 on the back flank of C57BL/6 mice by intradermal injection of F10 melanoma cells (5 \u00d7 10 6 /mouse). On day 5, palpable tumors were treated by intratumoral injection of pIL-2 (50 ng/mouse) once daily for 10 consecutive days (solid line); control groups were non-injected (dotted line) or injected with rhIL-2 (dashed line). Survival of the animals (n = 6) in all groups was followed daily. Shown is 1 of 2 experiments with similar results. p = 0.009 for rhIL-2 treated and p = 0.02 for non-treated control groups (Mann-Whitney U test). (b) Tumor-bearing mice were treated as described above. On day 20, the number of metastatic colonies in the lung was counted under a dissection scope. Autopsy was performed at the time of death in mice that died before day 20. Shown are the combined results from 2 separate experiments (consisting of a total of 12 mice in each treatment group). * and **, p < 0.0001. (c) Tumor-bearing mice were treated for 5 days and spleen cells were stained for CD8, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intracellular IFN-\u03b3. IFN-\u03b3producing CD8 + T cells were counted by flow cytometry as a percentage of total CD8 + cells. Shown are the combined results from 2 separate experiments (consisting of a total of 5 -12 mice in each treatment group). *, p = 0.009; **, p = 0.02. (d) Tumor-bearing C57BL/6 Foxp3-eGFP mice were treated for 5 days and tumors were excised and digested with collagenase. Released cells were filtered (40 \u03bcm) and stained for CD3. Regulatory (CD3 + eGFP + ) and activated effector (CD3 + IFN-\u03b3 + ) T cells were counted by flow cytometry as percentages of total T (CD3 + ) cells; for analysis of the latter, the cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained for intracellular IFN-\u03b3. Shown are the combined results from 2 separate experiments (consisting of a total of 4 mice in each treatment group). *, p = 0.02; **, p = 0.001; ***, p = 0.001. pIL-2 has lower systemic toxicity than rhIL-2. C57BL/6 mice bearing an F10 melanoma were injected intratumorally with 1 \u03bcg (10000 IU) of pIL-2 or rhIL-2 3 times daily for 3.3 days (10 injections in total). Mice injected with PBS were used as negative control. (a) Two hours after the last injection, VLS was determined by the Evans Blue assay. Percent increase in extravasation is calculated by the formula (t/c \u2212 1) \u00d7 100, where t is the quantity of the dye in the lung of any given mouse and c is the mean quantity of the dye in the lung of the PBS-treated mice. *, p = 0.0005.
