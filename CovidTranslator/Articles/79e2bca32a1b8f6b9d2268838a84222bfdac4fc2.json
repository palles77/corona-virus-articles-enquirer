Staff were not required to be vaccinated but were encouraged to do so by the facilities.

Most cases in staff were suspected based on signs and symptoms, rather than confirmed by diagnostic testing. Additionally, it is possible that illness in staff is underreported, is subclinical illness, or is asymptomatic viral shedding or bacterial carriage. Previous reports on respiratory illness outbreaks in longterm care have shown transmission between staff and residents. 7, 8 Although the routes of transmission were not collected in the current study or at the sites, it is feasible that staff transmitted some infections. In a study of the impact of the H1N1 influenza A pandemic on health care workers at an acute care hospital in New York City, 65% of those diagnosed with H1N1 influenza A reported working with influenza-like symptoms prior to presenting to workforce health and safety for evaluation. 9 Similarly, Mitchell et al 10 reported that among health care workers who had influenza-like symptoms during the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, 28% continued working.",

Staff may experience increased anxiety as they try to avoid becoming infected and transmitting infections to residents, families, and other staff members. Therefore, it is important for infection control policies to include input from employee health because staff may be at risk of infection or a source of transmission. In addition, the teachers at the on-site schools and the occupational, physical, and rehabilitation staff were often required to adjust their schedules to provide services on residential units because shared facilities, such as classrooms and therapy areas, are closed in response to an outbreak. Outbreaks in pLTCFs also likely have a considerable economic impact caused by increased environmental cleaning, the increased use of personal protective equipment, laboratory testing, medications, blocked beds, unit closures, admissions to acute care hospitals, and staff absenteeism.",
