To prove this hypothesis, the effect of interruption of the olfactory pathway on spread of the virus was studied using in situ hybridization . Unilateral surgical ablation of this pathway prevented spread of the virus via the olfactory tract on the side of the lesion . MHV RNA could be detected, however, at distal sites on the operated side, indicating that the virus spread via well-described circuits involving the anterior commissure from the control (intact) side of the brain . Viral transport via the trigeminal nerve was not affected by removal of the olfactory bulb, showing that the surgical procedure was specific for the olfactory pathway. These results prove conclusively that MHV gains entry to the CNS via a transneuronal route, and spreads to additional sites in the brain via known neuroanatomic pathways.",

After 10-d-old C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intranasally with MHVJHM, viral RNA was detected in the olfactory and trigeminal nerves and their intermediate connections (15). To prove that MHVJHM spreads transneuronally, we attempted unilateral ablation of the olfactory bulb in these suckling mice . In preliminary experiments, we found that denervation by surgical methods was very difficult due to the small size of these animals. On the other hand, 4-wk-old mice, which are significantly larger, survived surgery and anesthesia, and the absence of fully calcified skulls facilitated the surgery. According to published reports, MHV causes an acute nasoencephalopathy in weanling and adult mice after intranasal inoculation (19) (20) (21) , so it was anticipated that MHVJHM would readily enter the CNS of 4-wk-old mice after this route of inoculation .",

If this interpretation is correct, surgical interruption of one of the neuroanatomic pathways should prevent viral spread. The olfactory pathway is amenable to surgical intervention at the level of the nasal epithelium, the olfactory nerve, or the olfactory bulb. Removal of the olfactory bulb is readily accomplished in 4-wk-old mice, and this operation was performed in order to interrupt spread of MHVJHM via the olfactory pathway. In addition, only one olfactory bulb from each mouse was removed, so that the intact bulb served as an internal control for virus spread . This surgical procedure should have no effect on the spread of the virus via the trigeminal nerve on either side of the brain .",

MHVJHM cannot be detected in the mesencephalic nucleus of the trigeminal nerve until 3-4 d postinfection, but since virus is believed to replicate in the nasal epithelium before spread (19, 21) , it is not possible to draw any conclusions about the rate of viral movement within the trigeminal nerve.
