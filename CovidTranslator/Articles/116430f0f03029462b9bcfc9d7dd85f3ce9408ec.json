Mycoplasmas are the smallest known prokaryotes. 1e3,5,6 They also represent the majority of the relatively few pathogenic Mollicutes found in animals. 1, 5, 6 Mycoplasmas have several characteristics that distinguish them from most other bacteria; notably they lack a cell wall, are one of the smallest independent replicating organisms, and the majority require sterols for growth. 1,5e7 Pathogenic mycoplasmas have a propensity for certain sites in animals, namely respiratory, ocular, and genital mucosa. 5, 6, 8 Some Mycoplasma species may cause persistent superficial infections, disseminate systemically, and invade surrounding tissues. 5, 6, 8, 9 Mycoplasma felis is frequently isolated from the feline conjunctiva, respiratory tract, and urogenital tract. 3 ,10e14 M felis is strongly suspected as an etiologic agent in feline conjunctivitis, respiratory disease, and polyarthritis. 3,5,9,11e13 However, it has not been reported to cause feline central nervous system disease, nor has any other mycoplasma been implicated in neurologic disease except Mycoplasma pneumoniae in humans. 1,15e18 The purpose of the present study is to report a case of M felis-associated meningoencephalitis in a young cat.",

A month previously the cat was acutely lethargic and was treated with one 24 mg dose (0.3 ml) of injectable cefovecin (Convenia; Pfizer) and enrofloxacin/silver sulfadiazine otic drops for 10 days (Baytril Otic; Bayer). Two weeks after this treatment, the cat developed a left-sided head tilt and a reported fever ranging from 103e104 F. The cat was then treated with a single 1 mg dose (0.2 ml) of injectable meloxicam (Metacam; Boehringer-Ingelheim) and sent home on one half tablet of 25 mg marbofloxacin once q 24 h (Zenequin; Pfizer) and 0.3 mg (0.2 ml) of meloxicam (Metacam; Boehringer-Ingelheim) oral solution. These treatments helped resolve the fever but did not abate the neurologic signs. Other pertinent history obtained included that the cat lived strictly indoors, was current on rabies and feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, panleukopenia vaccines, and there were no other pets in the household. The cat had been adopted from a shelter 4 months previously and had been reportedly healthy until presentation at the referring veterinarian.",

Routine physical and neurological examination revealed quiet mentation, marked cervical weakness manifested as ventroflexion, left-sided head tilt and severe tetraparesis with the thoracic limbs worse than the pelvic limbs. Menace response was bilaterally absent, and there was decreased nasal sensation bilaterally, horizontal nystagmus with the fast phase to the right, and left supraspinatus muscle atrophy. Proprioceptive positioning and hopping responses were decreased in all four limbs but worse in the thoracic limbs. Patellar and flexor reflexes were normal in both pelvic limbs but the thoracic limb withdrawal reflex was decreased bilaterally. Spinal pain was consistently elicited upon spinal palpation between the second and fourth lumbar vertebrae (L2eL4). Based on the neurological findings, a lesion was localized to the left rostral medulla, bilateral cortex and cervical spinal cord segments C1eC8, as well as L2eL4 vertebrae.",

Histologic examination of the spinal cord (including brainstem), cerebellum and cerebrum exhibited inflammation of varying severity. The leptomeninges in sections of spinal cord from C3eC6 were markedly expanded and effaced by accumulations of intact and degenerate neutrophils admixed with fibrin. Numerous coalescing aggregates of lymphocytes, plasma cells and histiocytes were also present adjacent to the outer edge of the white matter. Multifocal randomly distributed areas of white matter contained dilated myelin sheaths with occasional dilated axons and axonophagia. Areas of parenchymal rarefaction were present in the white matter, interpreted as pan-necrosis. Similar inflammatory and axonal changes were observed at the levels of T2, L2eL3 and L4eL5, however, all changes were judged as mild to moderate when compared to the cervical changes.

            "text": "Literature research on the broader category of Mycoplasma species pathogenesis offers some clues to potential mechanisms but no concrete answers specifically for M felis. Generally, respiratory infections caused by mycoplasmas involve adherence of the organisms to ciliated epithelium, which consequently can cause cell death. 6, 23 There are several other proposed mechanisms of Mycoplasma species pathogenesis such as hematologic dissemination and immunomodulatory effects on host cells. In particular, M pneumoniae has been extensively researched and is the only Mycoplasma species known to cause neurologic disease. 1,15e18 M pneumoniae has a limited ability to damage respiratory epithelial cells, but still remains a major pathogen of atypical pneumonia in humans. Moreover, M pneumoniae has been implicated in numerous extrapulmonary diseases, including variable neurologic manifestations. 15e18 The neurologic manifestations seen in people are classified anatomically as brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve disorders. Specifically, these are seen as encephalitis, transverse myelitis, and neuropathies of the cranial nerves and nerve roots. 15e18 The underlying pathophysiology has been attributed to three possible mechanisms; a direct type, an indirect type, and a vascular occlusion type. 17 The direct type of extrapulmonary disease by M pneumoniae involves locally induced cytokines that subsequently cause inflammation. The indirect type is immunomodulatory in nature, and extrapulmonary manifestations are the result of humoral immunity, autoimmune reaction, allergy, or production of immune complexes. The vascular occlusion type of neurologic manifestation encompasses both direct and indirect mechanisms following hematogenous spread of M pneumoniae. 17 All the above pathogeneses of M pneumoniae extrapulmonary neurologic disease are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive. In the cases of encephalitis and myelitis a combination of direct and indirect pathogenesis has been observed. There are also differences between early-onset and late-onset neurologic disease, as regards pathogenesis and findings. Early-onset encephalitis and early-onset myelitis are typically seen more in children than adults, and detection of M pneumoniae in the CSF is also seen more frequently. 15e18 Hematogenous dissemination and detection of M pneumoniae from CSF are also relevant to our present case report as M felis was cultured from the CSF. The histopathologic diagnosis of the cat's brain and spinal cord (lymphoplasmacytic, suppurative meningoencephalomyelitis) was similar to findings of central nervous system (CNS) disease caused by M pneumoniae. Failure of the cat to improve clinically on appropriate antimicrobial therapy (fluoroquinolones have activity against Mycoplasma species and cross the bloodebrain barrier) in this cat supports the indirect type host immune response as a pathomechanism, as seen in M pneumoniae. In fact, immunosuppressive steroid therapy has been recognized as beneficial in cases of human M pneumoniae neurologic disease. 15, 16, 18 Mycoplasmas are known to cause abscessation, and it is conceivable that extrapulmonary manifestation from a concurrent M felis infection is possible. However, an underlying clinical respiratory infection was not supported by this cat's history and no pulmonary lesions were found at necropsy. Therefore, the pathogenesis of this animal's encephalitis may not parallel the M pneumoniae encephalitides in humans as sequelae to respiratory disease. In this case, it is also unknown whether M felis acted as a sole pathogen, or was a sequela to another bacterial or viral infection. The otitis media-interna seen on necropsy suggested a concurrent infection and could have contributed to the head tilt but not to the multitude of neurologic signs secondary to brain and spinal cord involvement. The veterinary literature reports of middleeinner ear infections in cats are associated with Staphylococcus species, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. 24 This cat did not have the appropriate dose or length of antibiotic regimen appropriate for otitis media, but none of these organisms were seen on culture of the CSF or CNS tissue. 24 Thus, even if the concurrent otitis media played a role in contributing to vestibular signs, it is doubtful that CNS involvement from a subsequent otitis interna was the cause for this particular cat's severe non-antibiotic responsive neurologic disease. Isolation of only one organism as a pure culture, ie, M felis, from the CSF and CNS lesions supports the conclusion that this cat's multifocal neurological signs were significantly contributed by this organism, even if a comorbid disease was present.",
