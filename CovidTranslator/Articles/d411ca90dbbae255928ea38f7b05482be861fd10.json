Among myriad biological questions to be answered regarding SARS-CoV-2, one that is crucial and has intrigued much interest is the host origin and its mode of transmission to humans. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV are closely related, and both invade human cells via attaching their S proteins to a host transmembrane protein called angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the entry point 3 . Using transcriptome data, some studies analyzed spatial expression patterns of ACE2 in various tissues and cell types of the human body, and reported that the receptor gene is indeed expressed in the lungs [4] [5] [6] . The connections between ACE2 expression and viral infection are further supported by cases from the United States, which confirmed for the first time the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in both the upper respiratory tract and stool Some studies have suggested that the original host of SARS-CoV-2 may be bats 2 .",

SARS-CoV is known to infect cats 44 , while SARS-CoV-2 positive cats and dogs had also been reported 45, 46 , therefore our analyses suggest high possibility that cats and dogs can host SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, in both cats and dogs, skin had high abundant ACE2 expression, so did ear tip in cats and retina in dogs. High ACE2 expression levels in these exterior body parts makes them particularly likely to host SARS-CoV-2 and pass on to humans via skin to skin contact. Stray animals can even be more serious transmitters of coronaviruses. It is estimated that there are approximately 500 million stray dogs and similar number of stray cats worldwide 47 .",
