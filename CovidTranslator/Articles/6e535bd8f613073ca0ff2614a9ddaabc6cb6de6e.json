            "text": "The structure of gp41 was a long-sought and elusive goal for HIV biologists. The difficulties of working with a membrane protein, the strong tendency of gp41 to aggregate, and other hurdles stood in the way. When Chan et al. 1 and Weissenhorn et al. 2 finally produced the first structures in 1997, followed shortly by Tan et al. 3 , they began to give molecular form to the apparatus of viral fusion, whose outline had emerged earlier in the decade. The structures are the focus of much work to design new inhibitors of the fusion process, and serve as an outstanding example of how findings in basic science can stimulate exploration of new therapeutics. This is what fusion looks like: envelope spikes composed of gp41 and gp120 decorate the surface of HIV-1. The surface glycoprotein of the spike, gp120, engages CD4 and CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptors, primarily on macrophages and CD4 + T cells. gp120 undergoes conformational changes to activate gp41, a transmembrane glycoprotein that uses conserved structural elements to mediate the fusion of the host and viral membranes. Genetic information can then flow from the virus to the target cell.",

In such a response, host antibodies bind to the virus and prevent it from entering the target cell To manage this problem, HIV-1 has evolved to keep the vulnerable conserved regions of the envelope spike-such as those on gp41 that comprise the fusion machinery-hidden as much as possible. This serves two purposes: it restricts the ability of conserved epitopes to elicit antibodies (low immunogenicity), and it helps prevent antibodies that are elicited from binding to conserved epitopes (low antigenicity). Neutralizing antibodies against conserved epitopes are a particular threat to HIV-1, as escape via mutation is more difficult than for variable regions of the envelope spikes.",

After receptor engagement, during which gp41 is perhaps most vulnerable, access to the fusionintermediate state of gp41 is restricted by the closely opposing membranes. The fusion process itself takes only minutes, which significantly limits access to the transiently exposed epitopes on gp41. In contrast, the postfusion conformation of gp41 is a stable repeating unit that is highly immunogenic. This postfusion conformation appears to be so radically different from the fusion-intermediate conformations of gp41 that elicited antibodies are unable to bind to the intermediate conformations and therefore are unable to inhibit fusion.",

The C-HR region of gp41 is drawn here without defined secondary structure, but some models show it in an \u03b1-helical conformation. gp41-targeting fusion inhibitors such as T20 act on the fusion-intermediate conformation(s) of gp41 to inhibit six-helix bundle formation.
