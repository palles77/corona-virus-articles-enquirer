It has applications, among others, in data compression and oligonucleotide microarray production. The problem is NP-hard, and the existing exact solutions are impractical for large instances. In this paper, a new beam search algorithm is proposed for the problem, which employs a probabilistic heuristic and uses the dominance property to further prune the search space. The proposed algorithm is compared with three recent algorithms proposed for the problem on both random and biological sequences, outperforming them all by quickly providing solutions of higher average quality in all the experimental cases. The Java source and binary files of the proposed IBS_SCS algorithm and our implementation of the DR algorithm and all the random and real datasets used in this paper are freely available upon request.",

            "text": "The Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS) problem asks to obtain a shortest string that is a supersequence of every member of a given set of strings. A supersequence of a given string is a string that can be obtained by inserting zero or more characters anywhere in the given string. Among various applications of this problem are data compression (Storer, 1988; Timkovskii, 1989) , AI planning (Foulser et al., 1992) , query optimization in databases (Chaudhuri and Bruno, 2008; Sellis, 1988) , and bioinformatics, particularly DNA oligonucleotide microarray production (Hubbell et al., 1996; Kasif et al., 2002; Ning et al., 2005; Rahmann, 2003; Sankoff and Kruskal, 1983) . Microarrays are precious tools successfully used, among others, in gene clustering and identification, SNP detection, and fusion transcript detection (Ning et al., 2005; Rahmann, 2003; Skotheim et al., 2009) . Two well-known types of microarrays are cDNA and oligonucleotide microarrays (Kasif et al., 2002; Ning et al., 2005) , the latter known to be of higher sensitivity due to its lower cross-hybridization possibility (Kasif et al., 2002; Ning et al., 2005) . Oligonucleotide microarrays are usually manufactured by the photolithographic method. This method involves several synthesis steps, each to append a same nucleotide, which corresponds to a letter in {A,T,C,G}, to several designated probes. Since the process is accomplished by means of light exposure, the other probes, which are not to receive the nucleotide, are protected by a mask. The sequence of the nucleotides used in the synthesis steps is called the deposition string, whose length determines the number of the synthesis steps. For several reasons, it is desirable to keep the deposition string as short as possible (Kasif et al., 2002; Ning et al., 2005; Rahmann, 2003) . First, the masks and the synthesis steps are expensive. Even a small reduction in the length of the deposition string could lead to a significant reduction in the production cost (Rahmann, 2003) . Second, the total manufacturing time is increased as the number of synthesis steps is raised. Third, there exist possibilities for errors in microarray fabrication, because the masking task is not perfect; the probability for a masked probe to be exposed to the light is nonzero. Consequently, the probability for fabrication errors is usually increased as the number of the synthesis steps is raised. Therefore, a shorter deposition sequence is desirable to reduce the manufacturing cost, time, and error. On the other hand, the deposition sequence is a common supersequence of the underlying probes. This motivates the design of high quality algorithms for the SCS problem. Fig. 1 illustrates how the use of a shorter deposition sequence can lead to fewer synthesis steps, hence reducing the production cost, time, and error.",

            "text": "The SCS problem can be optimally solved in polynomial time for a fixed number of input strings, but it is NP-hard in general (Maier, 1978) . Consequently, it is highly unlikely to obtain a polynomial-time exact algorithm for the problem, unless P\u00bcNP (Garey and Johnson, 1979) . Exact algorithms proposed for the problem include a dynamic programming algorithm (Jiang and Li, 1995) and a branch and bound algorithm (Fraser, 1995) , which are both exponential, the former in the number of strings and the latter in the size of the corresponding alphabet. Therefore, these algorithms are especially beneficial when, respectively, the number of strings or the alphabet size is restricted. Other research has aimed at devising approximation and (meta) heuristic algorithms, which achieve 'good', but not necessarily optimal, solutions in acceptable time. Approximation algorithms for the SCS include Alphabet (Barone et al., 2001) , an approximate A n algorithm (Nicosia and Oriolo, 2003) , Reduce_Expand (Barone et al., 2001) , and Deposition and Reduction (DR) (Ning and Leong, 2006) . The approximation ratio of the algorithms Alphabet, Redu-ce_Expand, and DR is 9S9, which is not appealing. The algorithm DR is in fact a trivial combination of a heuristic mechanism with Alphabet, which, therefore, guarantees the approximation ratio of 9S9. The approximate A n algorithm provides a 1\u00fee approximation ratio, for any fixed e40, particularly e\u00bc0.2 in the experiments in Nicosia and Oriolo (2003) . However, the algorithm is not efficient (i.e. is not of polynomial time complexity) and the size of the search tree can grow exponentially with the size of the given problem instance.",

More recent metaheuristic algorithms include a hybridization of Memetic Algorithms with Beam Search called Hybrid MA_BS , to which we simply refer as MA_BS, and a randomized Beam Search called Probabilistic Beam Search (PBS) (Blum et al., 2007) . Another recent algorithm POEMS, together with its variants POEMS_f and POEMS_fw, was also proposed in Kubalik (2010) . However, as reported in Kubalik (2010) , it was outperformed by MA_BS in all the experimental cases. Based on the results reported in Blum et al. (2007) , PBS outperforms MA_BS in most the experimental cases. On the other hand, DR outperforms Alphabet, Tournament, Greedy, and Majority merge in all the experimental cases as reported in Ning and Leong (2006) . DR also outperforms Reduce_Expand for strings of length 50-100 (Ning and Leong, 2006) . However, no comparison of DR and PBS has yet been made, leaving unclear which one is the state-of-the-art. The time complexity of DR, as specified in Ning and Leong (2006) , is O(9S9 3 nm 2 ), where 9S9, n and m are, respectively, the size of the alphabet, the number of strings and the maximum length of the strings. No complexity of PBS or Hybrid MA_BS was reported in their proposing papers Blum et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "In this paper, we provide an improved beam search algorithm called IBS_SCS for the SCS problem, which, on average, outperforms all the three recent algorithms, namely DR, MA_BS, and PBS, in all experimental cases. A similar approach has been successfully used for the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem in Mousavi and Tabataba (2012). The proposed IBS_SCS algorithm has been inspired by the Blum et al.'s PBS algorithm but has the following distinct characteristics. First, it employs a different probability-based heuristic function than the one used in PBS. Using dynamic programming and at polynomial time and space costs, an array of probabilistic values is populated to facilitate the calculation of the heuristic values. Second, we use a technique called domination to further prune the search tree. The domination pruning technique has been inspired by Easton and Singireddy (2007) and Blum et al., (2009) used for the purpose of the LCS problem. However, our usage of this technique is different from those in Easton and Singireddy (2007) and Blum et al. (2009)) . To be precise, in Blum et al. (2009) , a candidate solution is checked for being dominated by every existing candidate solution, which is rather time-consuming. On the other hand, in Easton and Singireddy (2007) , only the 'best-so-far' solution is used as the potential dominator for a new candidate solution. In our algorithm, we use the k best-so-far solutions for this purpose, where k is a control parameter in the algorithm. This approach gives us a control to achieve a good amount of pruning in reasonable time. Finally, given the same beam size, PBS does more work than IBS_SCS, which implies that IBS_SCS can benefit from a larger beam size than that of PBS, given the same amount of execution time. The IBS_SCS algorithm outperforms PBS in all the experimental cases, as reported in this paper. It also outperforms MA_BS by providing solutions of the same or higher (average) quality in all the experimental cases, including the cases where PBS was outperformed by MA_BS as reported in Blum et al. (2007) .",

It uses Alphabet and a variant of Majority Merge in the deposition stage to generate the candidate supersequence. In fact, the use of Alphabet makes DR to be an approximation algorithm, which guarantees an approximation ratio of 9 P 9.

The method used here to evaluate candidate solutions is adapted from Mousavi and Tabataba (2012) where a similar problem, the LCS, was addressed. To evaluate a candidate solution x, we use the probability of R(x)!y, where y is a random string and the strings in R(x) are assumed to be independent in the sense that Pr\u00f0r i \u00f0x\u00de!y\u00de \u00bc Pr\u00f0r i \u00f0x\u00de!y9r j \u00f0x\u00de!y\u00de,8i,j A f1,. . .,ng,i a j. Our intuition for this heuristic function is that a candidate solution x 1 is likely to be superior to another candidate solution x 2 (of the same length) if, given a random string y of length k, x 1 .y is more likely than x 2 .y to be a common supersequence of the input strings, where x i .y, i\u00bc 1 or 2, indicates the string obtained by appending y at the end of x i . Of course, the probability of R(x)!y depends on the candidate solution x. In the extreme case where x is a supersequence of all the input strings, i.e., when S!x, this probability is 1 because R(x) would only include null strings. Fig.2 .

It is important to note that in some of the sequences in the real data, there were characters such as noutside the underlying alphabet. Such characters were randomly replaced with one of their candidate characters. We ran IBS_SCS with the parameters b\u00bc100 and k\u00bc7. We ran our implementation of DR on the random instances but used the reported results in Ning and Leong (2006) for real instances. Table 1 provides the comparison of IBS_SCS with DR on random DNA sequences. The first and the second columns show, respectively, the number and the length of the sequences in each problem instance.

The reduction percentage r% varies from 0.21 (for the case n \u00bc5000 and m\u00bc100) to 7.18 (for the case n \u00bc10 and m \u00bc100), with an average of 2.95 (not shown in the table). No complete run-time report was provided in Ning and Leong (2006) ; it was only mentioned that DR took less than 10 s for the random instance (n \u00bc100, m\u00bc100) and an average of 5-10 min for the random instance (n \u00bc1000, m\u00bc1000). The run-time of our (efficient) implementation of DR observed for these two cases are 20 s and 18091 s (about 30 min), respectively. However, the run-times of IBS_SCS for the corresponding instances are 1 s and 81 s (less than two minutes). This suggests that IBS_SCS should be significantly faster than DR. It is important to note the DR was observed to take more than 27 h for the last instance (n \u00bc5000, m\u00bc1000), for which no run-time was reported in Ning and Leong (2006) . The time taken by IBS_SCS for that instance was 469 s (less than 8 min). Fig. 3 depicts the growth of run-time for both our implemented DR and IBS_SCS with the number of strings n for a fixed sequence length of m\u00bc100 (our implemented DR and IBS_SCS algorithms are available on request). Table 2 provides the comparison of IBS_SCS with DR on real biological sequences. The first column in this table represents the dataset name. The definitions for the second to the seventh columns are as those for the first to the sixth columns of Table 1 . As indicated by Table 2 , IBS_SCS outperforms DR by obtaining shorter strings in all the eleven cases. The reduction percentage r% ranges from 2.93 (for DNA-6) to 9.72 (for PROT-1 and PROT-4), with an average of 5.98 (not shown in the table). Again IBS_SCS was observed to be significantly faster than DR. An interesting observation is that the reduction percentage gained by IBS_SCS is significantly higher for real than random biological sequences. The minimum r% for real instances is, as already-mentioned, 2.93, which is about the average r% (2.95) for random instances. This indicates that IBS_SCS is promising for practical use and further research for this purpose.",

Each class contains five instances, and each instance consists of eight strings, four of length 40 and the other four of length 80. On the other hand, each biological instance is characterized by a biological sequence s and a probability p. More specifically, the strings within each instance are obtained from the same biological sequence s by removing each of its symbols with a fixed probability p. The number of the strings in each instance is 10. Five biological sequences each with three probabilities of 0.1, 0.15, and 0.20 have been used to construct a total of 15 instances. The five biological sequences are two SARS Coronavirus DNA sequences obtained from a genomic database (http:// gel.ym.edu.tw/sars/genomes.html) and three protein sequences obtained from Swiss-Prot (http://www.expasy.org/sprot).

The algorithm is a constructive beam search and uses a heuristic function different from those already proposed in the literature for the SCS problem. The algorithm also uses the dominance property to effectively prune the search tree. However, it does not check for dominance with respect to every existing candidate solution as it would lead to a significant time-consumption. Neither is it restricted to using only the best solution found so far as it would then be not using the true power of dominance pruning. Instead, it selects the k best solutions found so far as potential dominators of candidate solutions at each iteration, where k is a control parameter in the algorithm. The proposed algorithm was compared with three recent algorithms proposed for the problem on both simulated and real biological sequences. It outperformed all the three algorithms in all of the experimental cases. This justifies that the proposed algorithm is promising for further research and improvements.",
