It has been previously shown that enzymatic removal of the poly(A) tail from virion RNA renders replication of these RNAs incompetent (Spector et al., 1975) , whereas translation was not affected. Indeed, our analysis of the minimal poly(A) length required for viral replication suggests that the high-affinity interaction of the poly(A) tail with PABP1 is more critical for efficient RNA replication than for IRES-dependent translation (although minor effects on translation have been observed in vivo; Figure 2D ). PABP1 is an important regulatory factor involved in the control of cellular mRNA stability and translation (reviewed by Sachs and Wahle, 1993; Sachs et al., 1997) . It has been shown that PABP1 interacts with the translation initiation factor eIF4G (reviewed by Gingras et al., 1999) , and because eIF4G forms a complex with the cap-recognizing eIF4E, this interaction probably leads to the effective circularization of cellular mRNAs ( Figure 6A ). Using purified homologous yeast proteins, this circularization has been recently visualized with atomic force microscopy (Wells et al., 1998) .",
