The chicks were vaccinated against IBV on the second day of life with the vaccine Ma5, but at the age of 18 days, they exhibited clinical signs and macroscopic lesions compatible with avian infectious bronchitis (IB). In the clinical disease stage, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the trachea, lungs, and small intestine of the chicks, while IBV variants were detected in the bursa of Fabricius and kidneys. Subsequently, new samples were collected from the same batch at the end of the production cycle. In this phase, the Ma5 vaccine strain was detected in the kidneys, small intestine, and oviduct of the hens. However, a previously unidentified IBV variant was found in the cecal tonsils. Additionally, a fragment of viral RNA with that was completely identical to the corresponding region of the Ma5 vaccine was detected in the allantoic fluid of viable embryos from the hens under study after 18 days of incubation. These findings suggest that, in addition to the Ma5 vaccine, other strains of IBV variants can coexist, seeming to establish a chronic infection in the chickens, and that they can potentially be transmitted vertically. These results may assist in immunoprophylaxis control programs against IBV.",

Therefore, the importance of IB lies in the economic losses, as the infection often causes respiratory disease in broiler chickens, decreasing weight gain, increasing mortality and the rejection of slaughter carcasses, and increasing the susceptibility of the chickens to opportunistic bacterial infections [32] . In laying and breeding hens, the infection has been associated with a decrease in production, a worse internal and external quality of the eggs, and a reduction in the hatchability rate [41] . The difficulty in controlling IB is a result of the multiple unpredictable IBV variants that emerge or are introduced on poultry farms. Due to the emergence of new genotypes, pathotypes, and serotypes, IB has not yet been satisfactorily controlled and stands out as one of the most important health problems related to the reduction in the productive capacity of chickens and consequent economic losses in the poultry industry [20] [21] [22] .",

Our analysis of partial sequences of amino acids of the S1 gene showed that changes in the amino acids of the strains obtained from the kidneys were located at residues 51, 55, 83, 113, 161, and 187. The receptor-binding domain of the Fig. 1 Phylogenetic analysis of 219 S1 sequences of IBV. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree shows the genetic relationship between the IBV strains identified directly from the clinical samples of the chicks (lung, KU736759; kidneys, KU736755; small intestine, KU736753; bursa of Fabricius, KU736752), from the cecal tonsils of the hens at the end of the production cycle (KU736762), and from the Ma5 vaccine (KU736747), some previously described Brazilian strains, and 199 reference strains. The numbers beside the nodes correspond to bootstrap values IBV (aa. includes the 51-55 region identified in this study. These results suggest that the changes found in this region can be correlated with the pathogenicity of the nephropathogenic strain (KU736755).",
