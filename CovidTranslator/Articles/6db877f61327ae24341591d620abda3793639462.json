The field of molecular testing for pathogens has been expanded in clinical laboratories, and the molecular testing industry has responded quickly with the production of new molecular test kits. Numerous studies, including viral etiology, epidemiology, risk factors, clinical and laboratory characteristics, and diagnostic tests, have been reported [3] . Despite the fact that clinical laboratory practice was a critical element in the response to the H1N1 influenza outbreak, there are only a few reports regarding this aspect of testing [2, 4, 5] .",

The elements of clinical laboratory preparedness and responsiveness include availability of personal protec- tive equipment and its appropriate use, availability and use of appropriate testing supplies, adequacy of staffing, and infrastructure requirements including laboratory space [2] . In 2012 and 2013, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office for Europe conducted a joint survey [10] . Although the number of countries that had laboratory capabilities to detect and confirm MERS-CoV increased in 2013 (55.8%, 29 of 52 countries) compared with 2012 (47.8%, 22 of 46 countries), a half of the countries were still unable to test MERS-CoV [10] . The present study reveals a snapshot of the current status and capability of clinical laboratories to respond to the MERS-CoV outbreak in the Republic of Korea. Most clinical laboratories participating in the survey were considered to have sufficient capacity to respond to the outbreak. Immediately after the MERS-CoV rRT-PCR test was approved, many laboratories were able to perform testing seven days a week and the number of tests reported increased dramatically. The median TAT of more than a half of the laboratories (57.7%) was shorter than 6 hr, and the minimum median TAT was 4.00 hr. The results were reported within 24 hr in all medical institutions except one. One limitation of our study is that even though we obtained responses from the majority of medical institutions and referral medical laboratories, the results may not be fully representative for a number of reasons. Data were collected before the end of the MERS-CoV outbreak and did not include some major medical institutions and public health laboratories such as the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In addition, our results report the number of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR tests, and not the number of MERS-CoV cases.",

The laboratory diagnostic guidelines for MERS-CoV testing of the Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine recommended using specimens from the lower respiratory tract. In the present survey, the number of positive results from MERS-CoV rRT-PCR was significantly higher in specimens obtained from the lower respiratory tract (1.01%, 204/20,183) compared with specimens from the upper respiratory tract (0.6%, 41/6,785) (P = 0.002, chi-square test).

In conclusion, the results of this survey contribute to the comprehensive view of clinical laboratory response in the Republic of Korea to the recent outbreak of 2015 MERS-CoV. On the basis of currently available data, clinical laboratories in Korea were able to expand their diagnostic capacity in a short time and achieve a TAT of shorter than nine hours with testing seven days per week to response to the recent MERS-CoV outbreak, although the delay in the early period of the outbreak should be improved. Therefore, clinical laboratories should be ready for the maintenance and enhancement of laboratory responses in preparation for future emerging infections.",
