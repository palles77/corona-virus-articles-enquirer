In this study, we found that TNF-alpha production was increased with viral replication in macrophages inoculated with a mixture of FIPV and anti-S antibody, and demonstrated that this culture supernatant had feline PBMC apoptosis-inducing activity. We also demonstrated that the expression level of the FIPV virus receptor, feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN), was increased in macrophages of FIP cats. For upregulation of TNF-alpha and fAPN in macrophages, viral replication in macrophages is necessary, and their expressions were increased by ADE of FIPV infection. It was demonstrated that a heat-resistant fAPN-inducing factor was present in the culture supernatant of FIPV-infected macrophages, and this factor was TNF-alpha: fAPN expression was upregulated in recombinant feline TNF-alpha-treated macrophages, and FIPV infectivity was increased in these macrophages. These findings suggested that FIPV replication in macrophages increases TNF-alpha production in macrophages, and the produced TNF-alpha acts and upregulates fAPN expression, increasing FIPV sensitivity.",

FCoV is mainly composed of nucleocapsid (N) protein, transmembrane (M) protein, and peplomer spike (S) protein (Olsen, 1993) . FCoV is classified into types I and II according to the amino acid sequence of its spike protein (Hohdatsu et al., 1991a; Motokawa et al., 1995 Motokawa et al., , 1996 . Each of these types consists of two viruses: FIP-causing FIP virus (FIPV) and non-FIP-causing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) . FIPV and FECV of the same type cannot be distinguished by their antigenicity or at the gene level, and differ only in their pathogenicity for cats. Thus, there are types I and II FECV and FIPV in FCoV. FECV is asymptomatic in cats, but FIPV infection induces feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). FIP is a fatal disease mainly developing immune complex vasculitis accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation. The difference in pathogenicity between FECVand FIPV is considered to be associated with macrophage tropism of each virus (Rottier et al., 2005) .",

These phenomena are known as antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection. There have been several reports concerning ADE of other virus infections (dengue virus, HIV and respiratory syncytial virus, etc.; Suhrbier and La Linn, 2003; Sullivan, 2001; Tirado and Yoon, 2003) , and ADE of SARS-CoV infection, belonging to coronavirus as FIPV, has recently been reported (Weingartl et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2005) . ADE of FIPV infection has been reported to be induced by antibodies against FIPV spike (S) protein (Hohdatsu et al., 1991b; Corapi et al., 1992; Olsen et al., 1992) . FIPV infects macrophages via the virus-bound anti-FIPV-S antibody Fc region and Fc receptor on the macrophage surface, inducing ADE. ADE-induced aggravation of the pathology in FIP cats is considered to be due to an increased viral infection rate in macrophages.",

Of these cytokines, TNFalpha is a feline lymphocyte apoptosis-inducing factor, and its involvement in lymphopenia in FIP cats has been suggested (Dean et al., 2003; Takano et al., 2007) . Increased TNF-alpha expression in monocytes and macrophages in FIP cats has been noted (Dean et al., 2003; Kipar et al., 2005; Takano et al., 2007) . Kiss et al. (2004) reported that the expression level of TNF-alpha mRNA in FIP cat-derived PBMC was increased, whereas that of IFN-gamma mRNA was reduced. However, many points remain unclear, such as whether this increase in TNF-alpha is directly related to FIPV replication in macrophages, and whether induction of ADE of FIPV infection in macrophages affects TNFalpha production.",

This ADE-induced aggravation of the pathology in FIP cats has been interpreted that binding of FIPV with antibodies elevates the macrophage infection efficiency, increasing virus production. We demonstrated that TNF-alpha production was elevated with an increase in virus production in macrophages inoculated with a mixture of antibody and FIPV (ADE-induced FIPV-infected macrophages). When macrophages were inoculated with heatinactivated FIPV, TNF-alpha production was not increased, suggesting that FIPV replication in macrophages is necessary to induce TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha is a cytokine involved in the regulation of immune function, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. However, overproduction of TNF-alpha is known to have a negative influence on the body. For example, aggravation of the pathology by overproduction of TNF-alpha in inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, and viral infections, such as dengue and Ebola virus infections, has been reported (Atrasheuskaya et al., Fig. 4 .

The culture supernatant was collected after 3 days, and heated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min to inactivate viruses. SPF catderived macrophages (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) were cultured with medium containing 10% inactivated culture supernatant. The cells were collected on days 0, 1, 3, and 5 of culture, and the intracellular fAPN mRNA (A) and cell surface fAPN (B) expression levels were measured. fAPN mRNA was quantitatively analyzed in terms of the relative density value to the mRNA for the housekeeping gene GAPDH.

Fig. 5 . Relationship between fAPN mRNA expression and FIPV infection in cultured feline macrophages. SPF cat-derived macrophages (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells) were cultured with medium alone, FIPV, FIPV + \u03b1-FIPV S MAb, and \u03b1-FIPV MAb alone. The cells were collected after 3 days, and the FCoV N gene and fAPN mRNA were detected by RT-PCR. FCoV N gene and fAPN mRNA were quantitatively analyzed in terms of the relative density value to the mRNA for the housekeeping gene GAPDH. n = 5, ** p < 0.01. N.D.: not detected. pected, the fAPN expression level was increased in the macrophages. We speculated that TNF-alpha may have been produced as FIPV replicated, and autocrinally or paracrinally acted on macrophages and promoted fAPN expression. To verify this concept, it is necessary to examine whether anti-feline TNFalpha antibody can inhibit the ability of the FIPV-infected macrophage culture supernatant to induce fAPN in macrophages. We also revealed that infection of recombinant feline TNFalpha-treated macrophages with FIPV increased FIPV production. TNF-alpha is known to affect other viral infections. It has been reported that TNF-alpha makes vascular endothelial cell invasion by viruses easier in Ebola virus infection (Yonezawa et al., 2005) . In rhinovirus infection, when cells were infected after treatment with TNF-alpha, the infection efficiency was increased compared to that in untreated cells (Subauste et al., 1995) , and this was considered to be due to an increase in the expression level of the rhinovirus receptor, ICAM-1 (Shafren et al., 1999) . In FIPV infection, TNF-alpha may similarly act on macrophages and increase the fAPN expression level, increasing FIPV sensitivity.",

We also confirmed that FIPV infectivity was elevated as fAPN expression increased in macrophages. TNF-alpha production was significantly increased in ADE-induced FIPVinfected macrophages compared to macrophages infected with FIPV alone. It was suggested that when humoral immunity is induced in FIPV-infected cats, ADE induces viral replication in macrophages and overproduction of TNF-alpha, resulting in: 1) lymphocyte apoptosis induction, and 2) advanced FIP onset due to the virus sensitivity being upregulated by the increased virus receptor (fAPN) expression in macrophages. Based on the fact that weakly pathogenic FECV is less likely to infect macro- Fig. 7 . Changes in fAPN expression level in macrophages treated with recombinant feline TNF-alpha.
