            "text": "Licensed live attenuated virus vaccines capable of expressing transgenes from other pathogens have the potential to reduce the number of childhood immunizations by eliciting robust immunity to multiple pathogens simultaneously. Recombinant attenuated measles virus (rMV) derived from the Edmonston Zagreb vaccine strain was engineered to express simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) Gag protein for the purpose of evaluating the immunogenicity of rMV as a vaccine vector in rhesus macaques. rMV-Gag immunization alone elicited robust measles-specific humoral and cellular responses, but failed to elicit transgene (Gag)-specific immune responses, following aerosol or intratracheal/intramuscular delivery. However, when administered as a priming vaccine to a heterologous boost with recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 expressing the same transgene, rMV-Gag significantly enhanced Gag-specific T lymphocyte responses following rAd5 immunization. Gag-specific humoral responses were not enhanced, however, which may be due to either the transgene or the vector. Cellular response priming by rMV against the transgene was highly effective even when using a suboptimal dose of rAd5 for the boost. These data demonstrate feasibility of using rMV as a priming component of heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens for pathogens requiring strong cellular responses.",

All currently registered vaccines are based on live attenuated measles viruses, generated by extensive propagation and attenuation in cell culture [4, [7] [8] [9] [10] . Although different measles vaccines differ in the way they were attenuated, they all share a durable efficacy and safety record [4] . The protective immunity against measles is efficiently induced with 1 to 2 measles vaccine immunizations [6, 11] , which strongly stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Measles-specific humoral responses are detectable for as long as 33 years after vaccination [4] , possibly due to boosting by natural exposure.",

Mucosal delivery mimics natural infection, which is known to be highly immunogenic [12, 13] . A number of vaccine campaigns demonstrated superior immunogenicity of aerosol delivered Edmonston Zagreb (EZ) measles vaccine compared to the injected vaccine, either as a primary or a boosting immunization [14] [15] [16] . The safety of attenuated measles vaccine has been proven in numerous clinical trials and with postmarketing surveillances [3] . Good safety profile of attenuated measles vaccine is due to high stability of the viral genome that prevents reversion to highly virulent species. In addition, measles virus, which is a non-segmented single strand negative RNA virus, replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm of infected cells [17, 18] ; thus the viral genome cannot integrate into the host chromosome. Due to straightforward manufacturing, the measles vaccine can be produced in large scale and at low cost. The safety record, immunogenicity and manufacturability make live attenuated measles virus an attractive candidate to develop as a recombinant vaccine vector.",

            "text": "In a recombinant measles vaccine (rMV) vector, an antigen from another pathogen is incorporated into the measles genome. During the replication and transcription of rMV in a cell, the transgene is expressed together with viral proteins and presented to the host immune system, inducing a transgene-specific immune response. Thus a multivalent vaccine vector would induce not only strong immunity and protection against measles but also against another pathogen. A number of different transgenes, including genes from human papilloma virus, SARS coronavirus, West Nile virus, and human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV/SIV), have been stably incorporated into the recombinant measles genome, with demonstrated transgene protein expression [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . In vivo studies with measles virus and recombinant measles vectors have traditionally been performed in immunocompromised (IFN\u03b1 receptor \u2212/\u2212) mice transgenic for human CD46 receptor, a measles virus receptor [19, 22, 24, 26] . Immunogenicity studies in these animals demonstrated that recombinant measles vectors induce not only strong immune response against measles but also against the transgene [21, 22, 24, 25] . In immunocompetent mice, however, the immune response against the transgene is generally very low even though measles-specific responses are well induced (unpublished data), possibly reflecting the inability of measles vector to efficiently replicate in these animals. Our initial immunogenicity study performed in non-human primates using rMV vector based on the licensed EZ vaccine strain as the backbone and expressing SIVgag (rMV-Gag) failed to demonstrate transgene specific responses while animals developed measles specific immune responses (data not shown) [23] . We assume that this is due to the highly attenuated nature of the EZ strain, which is one of the safest measles vaccines currently in use [4, 8] , and would argue against the use of recombinant measles vector as a stand-alone vaccine against other pathogens.",

In addition, CD4 + T cells specific for the MV N protein were also detected in the BAL of all the animals four weeks after the homologous rMV boost except for one of the MV seropositive animals, ranging from 1-16% of the subset, as measured by intracellular cytokine staining following ex vivo peptide stimulation (ICS, Figure 2B ). There was no significant difference between the 1\u00d7 and 20\u00d7 groups with respect to the magnitude of the T cell response. Moreover, one of the animals with preexisting MV titers had a vigorous Nspecific CD4 + T cell response (7%), presumably elicited by the vaccine since MVseropositive animals that did not receive rMV (rAd5 prime group) were all <1%. These data are consistent with previous observations that aerosolized vaccine vectors are resistant to neutralization by preexisting serum antibodies to the vector [31] .

There was no evidence that rMV administered 8 and 16 weeks after rAd5 boosted these responses; however, without matched rAd5 only controls we cannot exclude this or the possibility of enhanced durability. We did observe a trend in which 20\u00d7 rMV primed for a greater magnitude CD8 + T cell response 4 weeks following rAd5 immunization, compared to unprimed rAd5 ( Figure 2D and 2E, p=0.07).

Mucosal IgA responses were largely undetectable, with no significant Gag-specific responses in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), saliva, or rectum (data not shown). Together, these data demonstrate robust immunogenicity elicited by rMV-Gag to the measles virus vector but weak humoral responses to the SIV Gag insert, consistent with AE delivery.",

When delivered either by aerosol or a combination of intratracheal and intramuscular routes, rMV-Gag increased the magnitude of Gag-specific peripheral blood and BAL T cell responses following the rAd5-Gag boost, particularly among CD8 + T cells. By contrast, humoral responses to the transgene were not significantly enhanced by rMV, despite elicitation of strong functional antibodies against the MV vector. rMV on its own elicited robust measles-specific immunity but failed to induce transgene-specific responses. This finding is consistent with results from initial tests of the vector in rhesus macaques, in which rMV-Gag was administered intramuscularly as a homologous prime-boost (data not shown). rMV derived from the EZ strain is thus a potent vaccine against measles but not an immunogenic vector against a transgene unless combined with another vector, such as adenovirus, in a heterologous primeboost regimen. In this context, rMV can prime for strong cellular responses against the transgene even with suboptimal boosting.",

Replication of measles virus, a single-stranded negative-sense RNA virus, is necessary for high-level transgene protein synthesis. While measles proteins are present within the vaccine and prime the immune response for a boost from small quantities of measles protein produced upon low-level viral replication, high-level transgene protein availability and immune response elicitation is dependent on the extent of vector replication. The EZ measles strain used for generation of the rMV-gag vector is highly attenuated, as demonstrated by its superb safety in infants, and may thus explain the poor immunogenicity of rMV-Gag for the transgene when used as a stand-alone vaccine. Although we confirmed the Gag protein expression in vitro by Western blot (data not shown), it is possible that the amount of Gag protein produced by the measles vector is insufficient to elicit detectable immune response but adequate to prime T cells for a subsequent boost. We also cannot exclude potential defects in antigen processing and presentation of the rMV-encoded transgene, but why this would occur for the transgene but not for MV proteins is not evident.",

            "text": "T-cell priming was observed in both of our non-human primate studies, although the effect was more pronounced in Study B compared to Study A. This difference may be due to several factors. First, rMV was administered exclusively in the airway mucosa in Study A, whereas one of the rMV primes in Study B was administered IM. A systemic rMV prime may enhance blood cellular responses to a greater extent than AE delivery. In addition, rAd5 was administered by different routes. Aerosol rAd5 delivery (Study A) is less immunogenic for peripheral blood T cell responses than IM delivery (Study B) [32] , limiting the magnitude of the PBMC response to rAd5 in Study A. Furthermore, different doses of rAd5 were used in the studies, although it is not clear why a suboptimal dose of rAd5 (10 7 PU; Study B) would induce a larger response than an optimal dose (10 10 PU; Study A) primed by the same dose of rMV. And finally, the interval between the rMV prime and the rAd5 boost was much greater in Study B (20 weeks) than in Study A (8 weeks). This may have allowed more time for rMV-Gag replication, transgene synthesis, and immune presentation. Although we cannot conclude at this time which factor is crucial for the observed differences, the fact that we observe T-cell priming by rMV in two independent and different heterologous prime-boost studies underscores the robustness of this mechanism. We hypothesize that the priming ability of rMV is not limited to boosting with rAd5. Likely any other live viral vector would be a suitable boosting vaccine for rMV in a heterologous prime-boost regimen.",

Lack of Gag antibody responses might be due to relatively poor immunogenicity of Gag, since we previously demonstrated that a single aerosol immunization with rAd5 encoding an Env HIV transgene at the same dose elicits serum IgG responses [31] . And in another study, a recombinant version of Edmonston B MV induced robust Env HIV transgene-and MV-specific antibody responses in non-human primates [22] , suggesting Env is more immunogenic than Gag.

In general, heterologous prime-boost regimens are appealing for their potential to increase and broaden responses as well as to evade neutralizing antibodies against the priming vector. Employing rMV as a vaccine vector achieves sterilizing immunity against measles in addition to priming responses against another pathogen in a single immunization, which would help to reduce the number of immunizations given to children. Moreover, the specific regimen tested here offers an additional advantage of dose sparing for the boosting vaccine and, as such, increasing available dosages and decreasing costs. Future studies should examine rMV priming in combination with other boosting vaccine vectors and delivery via different routes to further enhance immunogenicity, particularly for humoral responses. In addition, incorporation of other, possibly more immunogenic transgenes will be important to assess the full potential of rMV to elicit transgene-specific immune responses. Evaluation of immunogenicity in MV na\u00efve and seropositive animals, followed by protection studies in an established animal challenge model, should ultimately prove the suitability of the technology and justify initiation of human clinical trials.",
