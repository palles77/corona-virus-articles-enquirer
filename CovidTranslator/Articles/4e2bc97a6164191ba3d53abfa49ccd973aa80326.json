These patients have poor survival and often require intensive medical resource utilization, and the mortality of them are about 20 times higher than that of non-severe 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) patients. 2,3 Thus, early identification of patients at risk of serious complications of NCP is of clinical importance. Several studies reported that the prevalence of severe NCP ranged from 15.7% to 26.1% and these cases were often associated with abnormal chest CT findings and clinical laboratory data. [3] [4] [5] Guan et al indicated that patients with severe NCP were more likely to show ground-glass opacity (GGO), local or bilateral patchy shadowing, and interstitial abnormalities on CT. 5 This likely reflects the clinical progression of disease but also offers an opportunity to investigate the clinical utility of chest CT as a predictive tool to risk-stratify the patients. Furthermore, the predictive value of chest CT in NCP prognosis is warranted as to assist the effective treatment and control of disease spread. Previous study suggested that higher CT lung score correlated with poor prognosis in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS). 6 Chest CT has been demonstrated to be an important approach for screening individuals with suspected NCP and monitoring treatment response according to the dynamic radiological changes of NCP. 7 Therefore, we enrolled a cohort of patients with moderate NCP on admission and observed for at least 14 days to explore the early CT and clinical risk factors for progression to severe NCP. Meanwhile, we also compared the CT and inflammatory indexes in patients with different source of infection or period from symptom onset to admission to provide deep understanding of the relationship among CT findings, epidemiological features, and inflammation.",

The images were reconstructed to 1.0-mm thickness for the transverse scans. Sagittal and coronal reconstructions with a 3.0-mm thickness were performed. All CT images were reviewed independently by two radiologists, each with over 10 years of experience in chest imaging. A third experienced radiologist was consulted if there was a disagreement in interpreting imaging results. The imaging features including ground-glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, crazy-paving, and air bronchogram defined as previous studies were recorded. 8, 9 The lesion distribution pattern, lobe and segment involvement were also assessed. The CT findings in the outer one third of the lung were defined as peripheral, and those in the inner two thirds of the lung were defined as central. Besides, the presence of discrete nodules, lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion was recorded. Each of the five lung lobes was reviewed for opacification and consolidation. The lesions extent within each lung lobe was semi-quantitatively evaluated by scoring from 0 to 5 based on the degree of involvement: score 0, none involvement; score 1, \u2264 5% involvement; score 2, 6%~25% involvement; score 3, 26%~50% involvement; score 4, 51%~75% involvement; score 5, > 75% involvement. The total score was calculated by summing up scores of all five lobes to provide a CT severity score ranging from 0 to 25. 7 .

We found that progressive patients were older and had a greater number of underlying hypertension than stable patients. These data were in agreement with another recent report, which suggested that age and history of hypertension may be risk factors for short-term progression. 10 Our study further showed that progressive patients had lower baseline lymphocyte count, higher NLR and C-reactive protein. COVID-19 virus might act on lymphocytes as does severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which induces a cytokine storm and results in a series of immune responses. 11 Some studies suggest that decrease of T lymphocyte count indicate that coronavirus consumes many immune cells and inhibits the cellular immune function, and reduced but hyperactivated peripheral T cells partially accounts for the severe immune injury in COVID-19 patients. 12, 13 Thus, damage to lymphocytes might be an important factor leading to exacerbations of patients. NLR, as a simple lymphocyte related parameter to assess easily the inflammatory status, is widely used for the prediction of prognosis of patients with pneumonia. 14, 15 Higher NLR indicates damaged lymphocyte function and/or risk of bacterial infection due to low immune function. In addition, C-reactive protein is another serum maker produced by the liver in response to inflammation. Liu et al showed that C-reactive protein might be predictive of disease severity in COVID-19 infected patients. 16 Thus, our results suggested that patients with higher inflammatory levels on admission had higher risk to develop severe NCP.",
