These genetic domains may correspond to mutations mapping within the Sl and S2 glycoproteins, respectively, and suggest that both the Sl and S2 domains are important in eliciting the fusogenic activity of the S glycoprotein gene. In addition, assuming that most distal ts alleles map roughly 4.0 kb apart, a recombination frequency of 1% per 575-676 bp was predicted through the S glycoprotein gene. Interestingly, this represents a threefold increase in the recombination frequency as compared to rates predicted through the polymerase region. The increase in the recombination rate was probably not due to recombination events resulting in large deletions or insertions (~50 bp), but rather was probably due to a combination of homologous and nonhomologous recombination.",

The genomic RNA is arranged into seven or eight coding regions and is encapsidated within multiple copies of a 50-kDa nucleocapsid protein (N) (Lai, 1990; Siddell, 1983) . The N protein forms a helical nucleocapsid structure that is probably associated with the transcriptional complex Compton et a/., 1987; Stohlman and Lai, 1979; Stohlman eta/., 1988; Sturman eta/., 1980) . The nucleocapsid structure is surrounded by a lipid envelope and contains two or three virus-specific glycoproteins. The S glycoprotein has a molecular weight of 180 kDa and is frequently cleaved into two 90-kDa glycoproteins designated Sl and S2 (Frana et a/., 1985; Sturman et a/., 1980 .

The S glycoprotein is responsible for virus binding to the specific cellular receptor, induction of cell fusion, and elicitation of neutralizing antibody and cell-mediated immunity (Collins et al., 1982; Fleming et a/., 1986; Sturman et a/., 1980 . In addition to S, a 23-kDa M glycoprotein is present in the virion that probably functions in assembly and release (Sturman et a/., 1980 . In some strains of MHV, a 65-kDa hemagglutinin (HE) that shares considerable sequence homology with the influenza C virus hemagglutinin is also present (Luytjes et al., 1988; Shieh et al., 1989; Yokomori et al., 1989) . Upon entry into susceptible cells, the genomic RNA is translated into one or more polyproteins that act as an RNA dependent RNA polymerase (Mahy et a/., 1983; Brayton et al., 1982 Brayton et al., , 1984 . While the exact mechanism for MHV transcription is still under study, the preponderance of data suggest that the genome is initially transcribed into a full-length minus strand RNA, which acts as template for the synthesis of a genomelength RNA and six subgenomic mRNAs by \"leaderprimed\" transcription (Baker et a/., 1990; Baric et al., 1983 Baric et al., , 1985 Makino et a/., 1986a Makino et a/., , 1991 . In turn, the subgenomic mRNA then act as template for the synthesis of subgenomic minus strands, which participate in successive rounds of mRNA amplification (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990; Sethna et a/., 1989 Sethna et a/., , 1991 .",

During MHV replication, the RNA recombination frequency is unusually high and approaches 25% or more during mixed infection . Recently, biochemical analysis has revealed extensive polymorphisms and deletions in the sequence of the S glycoprotein gene of different MHV variants. The variant viruses were probably derived from nonhomologous recombination because no consensus or conserved sequences flanked the deletions (Banner et al., 1990; Parker et a/., 1990) . Sequence analysis of RNA recombinant viruses also suggests the presence of a recombination \"hot spot\" in the MHV S glycoprotein gene (Banner el al., 1990) . However, in the absence of selection pressure, RNA recombination sites in this region are random, suggesting that this preferred site reflects the selection for biologically more efficient recombinants .",

The results of these experiments are shown in Table 3 . The distances between different ts mutants were within statistical limits and permitted the construction of a genetic map (Fig. 3) . On the basis of their genetic recombination frequencies, the group F RNA+ ts mutants appeared to map into two distinct domains, designated Fl (LA7, LA12, NC6) and F2 (NC14, NC16, NC17, LA1 2).

To determine if recombination frequencies vary in different portions of the genome, we compared the maximum recombination frequencies between mutants spanning the polymerase genes of MHV (Group A (LA3/LA6) X Group E (LA1 8)) across gene B encoding the p30 and HE genes (Group E (LA18) X Group F (LA7/LA12)) or through the S glycoprotein gene (Group F (LA7 X NC16INC14)). All mutants were crossed three to five times and average recombination frequencies calculated as previously described (Fig. 5) . Interestingly, the maximum recombination frequency predicted between the two most distant ts mutants in complementation groups A (LA3, LA6) and E (LA18) in the 22-kb polymerase region ranged from about 1%/l 800 (LA1 8 X LA3) to 1 %I2500 (LA1 8 X LA6) nucleotides of ds RNA.

To test this possibility, cultures of cells were infected with various combinations of ts mutants as shown in Fig. 4 and RNA recombinant viruses isolated 14 hr postinfection.

The location of these primers as well as the size of predicted PCR products are shown in Fig. 4 . Cultures of cells were infected with various RNA recombinant viruses and intercellular RNA was harvested at 8-12 hr postinfection. Following cDNA synthesis and 30 rounds of amplification with the TAQ polymerase and specific oligonucleotide primer pairs, the DNA products were separated on 1% agarose gels and visualized by UV light or southern blotting techniques (Fig. 6) . In Fig. 6a , PCR products spanning the hypervariable region of MHV-A59, JHM, and MHV2 clearly demonstrate the 89 amino acid deletion that is present in the JHM S glycoprotein gene (Banner eta/., 1990; Parker eta/., 1990) . Southern blotting techniques using an internal oligomer probe demonstrate that the -1.5-kb fragment is specific for the MHV S glycoprotein sequences spanning nucleotides 642-21 15 and is not present in uninfected cells (Fig.  6b) . No obvious deletions were detected through the hypervariable region (Fig. 6c) , N-terminus, or C terminus in the S glycoprotein gene of over 20 different RNA recombinant viruses tested (Fig. 6d) . Since the distance between the group Fl and F2 mutants would have required sizable deletions (>lOO bp) to result in ts+ virus (Fig. 4) these data suggested that large deletions were rare events in these crosses, and did not contribute to an increase in the recombination frequency within the S glycoprotein gene.",

Using highly characterized ts mutants of MHV-A59, we established a genetic recombination map in the polymer- Predrcted nucleotide domarns of the group F RNA' mutants. Assumrng a recombination frequency of lo/01575 bp of dsRNA and that LA7 maps roughly 0.5 kb from the 5' end of the S glycoprotern gene, the tentatrve nucleotide domains of the mutants mapping in the Fl and F2 subgroups were predrcted. The hatched boxes represent the locatron of the region of polymorphism and putative hot spot of recombination in the MHV genome (Banner et a/., 1990; Parker et al., 1989) . Arrows represent the approxrmate locatron of neutralizing epitopes In the S glycoprotein (Routledge et al., 1991; Weissmiller et a/., 1990) . To determine if recombinatron events resulting in deletions were contributing to the increased recombinatron rate in the S glycoprotern gene, a series of crosses were obtained between different RNA+ mutants as shown at the top of the figure. PCR products spannrng different portions of the MHV S glycoprotein gene were obtained using specific oligomer products and the TAQ polymerase. The locatron of these primer pairs and their predicted products are shown in the bottom of the figure. To predict the maximum recombination frequency at the 5'end of the genome, we calculated the recombination frequency between the three most distant RNA-mutants (Group A RNA-mutants: LA3. LA6; Group F RNA-mutant: LA1 8) assuming that these mutants map at the most distant ends of the 22.kb polymerase region (-21 kb apart). To map the maximum recombination rate across the HE and p30 genes, recombination rates were determined between mutants mapping approximately 3.5 kb apart at the 3' end of the polymerase gene (LA1 8) and the 5' end of the S glycoprotein gene (Group F RNA+ mutants: LA7, LA1 2). Recombination rates were calculated through the S glycoprotein gene, assuming the group F RNA+ mutants LA7 and NC1 4/NC16 map roughly 4.0 kb apart. ase genes of MHV. Assuming that the recombination frequency was equivalent throughout the entire genome, these data suggested that the recombination frequency approached 25% or more . In this study, we have demonstrated that the ts mutants from a RNA+ complementation group of MHV-A59 can also be arranged into an additive, linear, genetic map.",

First, the group F mutants do not produce syncythium when maintained at the restrictive temperature. Induction of cell fusion has been mapped to either the S2 domain of the bovine coronavirus S glycoprotein gene (Yoo eta/., 199 1) or the MHV Sl and S2 glycoprotein domains (Gallagher et al., 199 1; Routledge et al., 1991; Weismiller eta/., 1990) . Second, Tl fingerprint analysis of RNA recombinant viruses derived from crosses between ts LA7 or LA1 2 and MHV-JHM demonstrated that the MHV-A59 Sl domain was always replaced by heterologous MHV-JHM sequences. Since no other region in the MHV-A59 genome was uniformly replaced in recombinant viruses, these data strongly suggested that the mutations in these ts viruses reside within the Sl coding sequences (Keck et al., 1987 (Keck et al., , 1988a Makino et al., 1986b Makino et al., , 1987 . Finally, sequence analysis of RNA recombinant viruses derived from these mutants place the ts allele in LA7 within the 5' most 1.1 kb of the Sl glycoprotein gene (Banner et a/., 1990) . While these data do not definitively prove that the Group F mutants map in the S glycoprotein gene sequence, these data have strongly supported the localization of these mutations within this coding region.",

Sequence analysis of the group F RNA+ mutants and revertant viruses will be required to definitively map the location of these alleles. However, since mutants from both subgroups are incapable of producing syncytium at the restrictive temperature, these data suggest that both domains are important in eliciting cell fusion.

These estimates were based on the assumption that the recombination frequency was uniform and approached 10/0/l 300-1400 nucleotides of dsRNA throughout the entire 32-kb MHV genome. However, recombination rates measured within the polymerase region and S glycoprotein gene were estimated to occur at frequencies of about 1%/l 800-2500 and 1%/575-667 bp of dsRNA, respectively (Fig.  5) . Recombination rates across the p30/HE genes were estimated to occur at about 19/o/l 100-l 400 bp of dsRNA. Currently, our best estimate for an MHV recombination frequency was measured within the S glycoprotein gene because these mutations must have resided within a 4.0-kb stretch of RNA. Moreover, the frequency of recombination was internally consistent between several independent crosses within a single complementation group (Table 3) . While definitive proof will require the identification of the exact location of the ts alleles used in these studies, these data suggest that the recombination frequency varies in different portions of the genome and is roughly threefold higher in the S glycoprotein gene.",

More importantly, Tl fingerprint analysis of RNA recombinant viruses derived from ts mutants in complementation groups C, D, and E clearly place each genetic function in the polymerase gene (Keck et a/., 1987; Lai et al., 1985) . Since RNA-complementation groups C, D, and E have also been demonstrated to function in mRNA synthesis and map within ORF 1 b, which contains polymerase, helicase, and metal-binding sequence motifs, it is extremely unlikely that these mutants map in the HE or p30 subgenomic ORFs Bredenbeck et a/., 1990; Lee et al., 1991; Schaad et al., 1990) . In contrast, the recombination rate predicted through the polymerase region was not inordinately high (1%/1800-2500 bp of dsRNA), but rather closely approximated the recombination frequencies estimated to occur in apthovirus and poliovirus infections (Cooper, 1977; King, 1987) .

            "text": "Since the enhanced recombination frequencies in MHV were observed within a physically smaller (4.0-kb) region as compared to the 22-kb polymerase region, it is possible that a mechanism similar to high negative interference in DNA viruses may account for the increased rates of recombination (Chase and Doermann, 1958) . This seems unlikely since high negative interference is probably mediated by DNA polymerase repair mechanisms, which have not been demonstrated in the MHV RNA polymerase (Glickman and Radman, 1980) . The increase in the recombination rate in the S glycoprotein gene could also not be attributed to a combination of true homologous recombination and recombination resulting in large deletions. Nonhomologous recombination probably explains the appearance of defective interfering RNAs of Sindbis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and MHV (Holland, 1987; Makino et a/., 1988 Monroe and Schlesinger, 1983) . Since deletions have been demonstrated in the MHV S and HE glycoprotein genes as well as in the nonstructural genes encoded in mRNA 4 and 5 and in the TGEV S glycoprotein gene and other subgenomic ORFs (Ban-ner el al., 1990; La Monica et al., 1991; Luytjes et al., 1987; Parker et al., 1990; Rasschaert et al., I 990; Schwartz et al., 1990; Yokomori and Lai, 1991) , these data have suggested that the subgenomic ORFs may be very amenable to frequent deletions and insertions. Insertions in the MHV S glycoprotein gene have also been reported previously (Taguchi et al., 1987) . Analysis of 20 RNA recombinant viruses derived from different crosses between the group F mutants suggested that large deletions or insertions were rare and occurred at <&the rate of true homologous recombination. While these data could not conclusively rule out the presence of very small deletions, this seems unlikely since the predicted distances between the ts alleles used in these crosses should have resulted in deletions ranging from -100 bp to > 1000 bp in length. It is also unlikely that the ts+ virus isolated from these crosses were revertants containing small deletions (~50 bp) in a singlets parent, since the ratio of recombinants: revertants was at least 9: 1 or greater in each of the crosses and none of the revertants analyzed from each parental ts mutant had evidence of deletions. Since revertants of SB ts mutants usually contain single nucleotide reversions at the site of mutation (Hahn et al., 1989a,b) , the most likely interpretation from these data is that the increase in the rate of recombination in the S glycoprotein gene probably reflects an increase in the rate of true homologous RNA recombination. If the mechanism for homologous recombination and recombinations resulting in deletions are similar as suggested by Banner et al., 1990 , these data suggest that the frequency of these two recombination events is very different. Alternatively, the regions flanked by the ts mutations used in these crosses may be critical for S glycoprotein gene function or plaque formation and could not be deleted.",

If the subgenomic minus strands partrcipate In template switching with full-length genomrc RNAs, recombrnation rates should increase from the 5' to the 3' end of the genome. Panel A demonstrates how template switching could occur during negative-strand synthesis between a full-length and subgenomic-length plus strand RNA and result In a full-length negative-stranded RNA recombinant molecule. Panel B demonstrates how template switching between full-length and subgenomic negative strands during positrve-strand synthesis could result in recombinant genome-length molecules, switching occur after the synthesis of UU in sites chosen to minimize the adverse free energy change involved in switching to a heterotypic template (King, 1988) . In addition, a nonrandom distribution of recombination sites has also been reported among intertypic poliovirus recombinants (Tolskaya et al., 1987) . If MHV RNA recombination is mediated by freely segregating RNA segments that are generated by transcriptional pausing during RNA synthesis, preferred sites of recombination may also exist in AU-rich regions and/or in regions of secondary structure in the MHV genome (Baric et al., 1987) . However, it is difficult to envision how these types of preferred sites of recombination would result in higher intratypic recombination frequencies between MHV-A59 ts mutants since extensive secondary structure is found throughout the MHV genome and the G:C:A:U and AA/UU dimer ratios are roughly equivalent in the polymerase and S glycoprotein regions (Banner et al., 199 1; Baric et al., 1987; Soe et al., 1988; Fu et al., unpublished) .",

These data indicate that the amount of negative-strand template RNA is unequal and increases from the 5' to 3' end of the genome. Because of the availability of more negative strand template, recombination rates should increase proportionately from the 5' to 3' end of the genome and be highest in the N gene coding region contained within mRNA 7. For example, recombination events in the polymerase region can only involve template switching between full-length negative-or positive-strand RNA templates. However, recombination events in the S glycoprotein gene or other subgenomic ORFs could not only occur between full-length RNA templates but also involve subgenomic mRNA and subgenomic negative-strand RNA templates as well.",

Second, in vitro transcribed subgenomic-length DI RNAs rapidly undergo RNA recombination with fulllength (or subgenomic) RNAs supporting the notion that recombination events can occur between different-sized template RNAs . Third, analysis of sepharose 2B-Cl column purified full-length RI RNA has demonstrated the presence of mRNA 7 subgenomic nascent-plus strands bound to the fulllength negative-strand RNA (Baric et al., 1983) . While the original interpretation of these data supported \"leader-primed\" transcription, an alternative explanation for these findings is that these subgenomic nascent-plus strands have disassociated from subgenomic RI RNA template and recombined with the fulllength negative-strand RNA. Finally, a large number of RNA recombinant viruses selected with markers in the S glycoprotein gene of MHV contain additional crossover sites in the M and N structural genes encoded at the 3' end of the genome (Keck et al., 1988b) . These findings are consistent with the idea that subgenomic minus strands function in RNA recombination and suggest that recombination events may increase in frequency toward the 3' end of the genome.",

            "text": "High-frequency RNA recombination is a unique property associated with MHV replication. Our data suggest that the frequency of RNA recombination is mediated in part by the large size of the MHV genome (32 kb) and its novel mechanism for RNA synthesis involving \"leader primed\" discontinuous transcription and mRNA replication via subgenomic minus strands (Baric et al., 1983 (Baric et al., , 1987 Sethna et a/,, 1989 Sethna et a/,, , 1991 Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990) . The possibility that the MHV recombination rate increases proportionately from the 5' to 3' ends of the genome may also contribute to the evolution, genetic diversity, and organization of coronavirus genomes. For instance, the gene order of IBV is different from other coronaviruses and it contains an additional gene between the M and N genes at the 3'end of the genome (Cavanagh eta/., 1991) . TGEV also contains an additional gene, designated X, which is located at the 3'end of the genome (Kapke and Brian, 1986) . More remarkably, so,me coronaviruses, but not all, contain a p30 nonstructural protein and an HE glycoprotein that is related to the influenza C virus HE (Luytjes et al., 1988) . Coronaviruses and toroviruses may also have diverged by nonhomologous recombination events in their polymerase and envelope proteins (Snijder et al., 1991) . These findings are consistent with the fact that the coronavirus genome has a remarkable ability to evolve by homologous and nonhomologous recombination, especially in the genes encoded by subgenomic mRNA.",
