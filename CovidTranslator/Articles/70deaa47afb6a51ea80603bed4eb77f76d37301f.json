            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has caused extensive economic losses to pig producers in many countries. It was recently introduced, for the first time, into North America and outbreaks have occurred again in multiple countries within Europe as well. To assess the properties of various diagnostic assays for the detection of PEDV infection, multiple panels of porcine sera have been shared and tested for the presence of antibodies against PEDV in an inter-laboratory ring trial. Different laboratories have used a variety of \"in house\" ELISAs and also one commercial assay. The sensitivity and specificity of each assay has been estimated using a Bayesian analysis applied to the ring trial results obtained with the different assays in the absence of a gold standard. Although different characteristics were found, it can be concluded that each of the assays used can detect infection of pigs at a herd level by either the early European strains of PEDV or the recently circulating strains (INDEL and non-INDEL). However, not all the assays seem suitable for demonstrating freedom from disease in a country. The results from individual animals, especially when the infection has occurred within an experimental situation, show more variation.",

Infection of swine by this virus causes disease characterized by diarrhoea and vomiting which can lead to severe dehydration and results in high (90-100%) mortality in newborn piglets (Stevenson et al., 2013) . Older animals (!14 days) normally recover from the infection and seroconvert against the virus. The disease was initially identified within the United Kingdom (UK) in 1971 and the detection of the aetiological agent, PEDV, was first achieved in Belgium (Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978) ; afterwards the virus spread within Europe and also to Asia (reviewed in Lee, 2015) . In 2013, outbreaks of the disease occurred for the first time in the USA (Huang et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2014) and rapidly spread within both North and South America. About 7 million piglets died in a single year as a result of the outbreaks in the USA alone Lee, 2015) .",

The virus produces a number of sub-genomic mRNAs which encode the various structural and non-structural proteins within infected cells. The virus particles include the spike (S) protein, the envelope (E) protein, the membrane (M) protein and the nucleocapsid (N) protein (Brian and Baric, 2005) . The spike protein is exposed on the virus surface and gives the virus particles their characteristic morphology. A number of different variants of PEDV are known (see Huang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Lee, 2015) . The early European viruses are represented by the CV777 strain (these are sometimes classified, on the basis of the S gene sequence, as being within genogroup 1a) while two different variants of PEDV (classified, on the same basis, within genogroups 1b and 2b) have been identified within the USA. The US PEDVs are also referred to as \"INDEL\" (e.g. OH 851, from the genogroup 1b) and \"non-INDEL\" (e.g. MN, 1A1 and 1A2 strains from 2013, in genogroup 2b); these differ by the presence of certain deletions and insertions within the S gene sequence (Huang et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2014; Lee, 2015) .",

The PEDV can be identified by RT-PCR (e.g. Kim et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2014) in faecal or intestinal samples from acutely infected animals and a low level of viremia has also been observed in serum from acutely infected pigs (Jung et al., 2014 Lohse et al., 2016) . However, the virus is only present in infected animals for a limited period (typically less than 1 month, see Lee, 2015) while the serological response can be expected to be much longer lasting (Crawford et al., 2015) .",

It is important to ensure that national diagnostic laboratories are able to detect PEDV infection efficiently when outbreaks of disease occur. For PEDV-free countries, like Denmark, Sweden and UK, or when planning to export animals from PEDV negative herds it is also important to be able to declare freedom from disease. Therefore, assays with both high sensitivity and high specificity are needed. Different laboratories use a variety of \"in-house\" assays; in addition, commercial tests for the detection of antibodies to PEDV are available. However, the properties of these different tests have not been analysed, in parallel, previously. An assessment of a range of tests, performed in different reference laboratories from Denmark (DK), Italy (IT), France (FR), The Netherlands (NL), Sweden (SE) and the UK using shared panels of porcine sera, collected from animals in the field and from experimental infection studies, has now been undertaken and the results of these analyses are presented.",

The antigen was coated (typically at 1:1000 dilution but titrated for each batch) onto 96-well ELISA plates, washed and then stored frozen until use. Sera (diluted 1:10) were added to the wells and incubated overnight at 20 C, prior to further incubation for 1 h with a biotin-conjugated pig anti-PEDV polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:100 in 10% normal pig serum) prepared essentially as described previously (S\u00f8rensen et al., 1997) .

The samples included known positive samples (from experimentally infected pigs), field samples collected from countries never known to have had cases of PEDV infection (SE and DK) and also field samples from herds in the US and Canada known to be infected with PEDV. It should be noted that the sera from SE had been selected following pre-screening using the ELISA 4 and found to be negative in this assay (Table 1B ). In addition, some samples from FR were field samples that were specifically selected because they were collected at the beginning of 2014 from clinically normal herds but (with one exception) had given unexpected positive results in the ELISA 4 (see below). These selected sera were collected prior to the re-appearance of PEDV in FR (Grasland et al., 2015) and are not considered representative of pig sera from FR in general.

To give an indication of the spectrum of results obtained in these tests, the number of individual tests scored as positive, inconclusive and negative are indicated ( Table 2 ).

As in the more restricted analysis (Table 6A) , the ELISA 4 was less satisfactory with a calculated sensitivity of 79% and specificity of 80%. For both sets of results (as in Table 6A , B), a sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the influence of priors on the final estimates by comparing different options including informative priors for all parameters, mildly informative priors for sensitivities, non-informative priors for sensitivities and non-informative priors for all parameters except prevalence estimate. Median estimates were not very different between the various models and were not strongly modified when non informative priors were used (data not shown). The option presented (using noninformative priors for sensitivities) was a good compromise in terms of precision of the estimates and the informative characteristics of the priors.",

Overall, it is apparent that, on a \"herd-basis\", each of the assays is able to successfully detect infection by both the old European strains and also by the two, more recent, strains (non-INDEL and INDEL) that have infected herds within the USA in 2013/2014. The INDEL PEDV strain has also occurred in a number of European countries in 2014 and 2015. However, there can be significant differences in the detection of antibodies in individual animals by the different serological assays, and so it is clearly necessary to test several animals from a herd to ensure that successful detection of an infection of the herd is achieved. This should not be a problem since it can be considered best practice to test a representative sample and it is known that the virus spreads rapidly through an infected herd. In general, it seems that infection in the field generates a higher level of anti-PEDV antibodies than is achieved within experimental studies. This is well demonstrated by the panel of 20 sera collected from a herd that had recently been infected PEDV (see Table 3 ). The majority of sera were scored as positive in the assays used here, especially with the ELISAs 1 and 3. However, in contrast, using sera from experimentally infected pigs, the proportion of positive tests was much lower with some assays (see Table 2 ). It was also apparent that the level of antibody blocking observed with the ELISAs 1, 2 and 3 was higher with the field sera than with the experimental sera. This may reflect the route, level and frequency of the virus exposure that occurs in the field compared to that used experimentally.",

For this purpose, it is particularly important that the assays demonstrate high specificity; otherwise \"false-positive\" reactions can require a lot of work to prove freedom from PED. It appears that the commercial ELISA 4 produces some false positive results. In Table 5 , it is shown that 2 out of 40 sera from uninfected herds scored positive. These sera scored negative in both the ELISA 1 and ELISA 3 \"in house\" assays. Similarly, a group of 10 sera from France were selected for testing in the ring trial on the basis of unexpected positive reactions in the ELISA 4 (Table 1A , 1B) since they were all collected from herds with no clinical signs of PED. These samples all tested negative in the ELISA 1. These were collected at the beginning of 2014 prior to the introduction of the OH 851-related (INDEL) PEDV into France that was first detected in December 2014. Some of these sera also tested positive in other assays (ELISAs 2 and 3) and thus it may be that the pigs have been infected with another agent that cross-reacts, to some degree, in these assays. It should be noted that the ELISA 4 detects antibodies to the PEDV nucleoprotein only whereas the other assays are based on the use of whole virus preparations. The ELISA 1 has been used on over 20,000 field sera from Denmark and there have been no positive reactions suggesting a high level of specificity for this assay; the statistical analysis presented in Table 6A , B confirms this. It seems unlikely that the non-specific reactions in certain other assays could be due to porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) infection as this is widespread in Europe, including in DK, and thus would be expected to give positive results in a larger proportion of sera than has been observed here.",

The ELISA 1 appears to have the highest analytical sensitivity since it was the only one capable of detecting a positive reaction using pre-diluted serum samples (Table 1A, 1B) . However, it was found that the antibody response to the experimental infection with the US PEDV did not induce a very strong antibody response, as determined by ELISA 1, and indeed the overall result was inconclusive in 1 of the 2 infected animals tested. For the sera from the experimentally infected pigs, it was possible, using this ELISA, to follow the generation of the immune response throughout the course of 28 days postinfection and it is clear that seroconversion did occur in each of the US PEDV inoculated pigs (see Lohse et al., 2016) . The ELISA 2 and ELISA 3 also had difficulty in detecting the immune response in the animals experimentally infected with the US PEDV (see Table 2 ). The ELISA 4 was better in this respect (see Table 2 ). In contrast to these results, using field sera, there was a very high degree of agreement between the ELISA 1 and ELISA 3 (see Tables 3-5 ) and 39 of 40 sera from the OH 851-related PEDVinfected herd in Italy all scored positive in both of these tests (Table 4 ) while 40 sera from uninfected herds, also in Italy, were all negative in both assays.",
