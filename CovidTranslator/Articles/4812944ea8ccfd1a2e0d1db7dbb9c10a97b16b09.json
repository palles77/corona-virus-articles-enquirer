Traditional approaches to mathematical modelling of infectious diseases deal most effectively with large outbreaks in large populations. The desire to elucidate the highly variable dynamics of disease spread amongst small numbers of individuals has fuelled the development of models that depend more directly on surveillance and contact-tracing data. This signals a move towards a closer interplay between epidemiological modelling, surveillance and disease-management strategies. DETERMINISTIC A process that does not contain an element of chance. Deterministic models are often used to describe the progress of an epidemic through large populations, in which small fluctuations at the individual level are assumed not to have an important effect on the dynamics.",

By creating a map of cholera deaths and tracing the source of water used by victims, he pinpointed the origin of infection to a contaminated water pump on Broad Street -and in doing so rejected the prevalent 'bad air' theory of cholera transmission 1 . His approach would not be out of place in modern epidemiology. Recent dramatic disease outbreaks, such as foot-andmouth disease in the UK, and emerging diseases in the human population, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), have highlighted the role of a suite of epidemiological tools -molecular typing, surveillance, tracing of infectious contacts and mathematical modelling -in monitoring disease spread and determining appropriate control measures.",

Here, it is assumed that significant depletion of susceptible individuals has not occurred, so that the number of cases grows exponentially, at a rate determined by R and the GENERATION TIME. Describing the dynamics in this way provides a straightforward estimate for R, with uncertainty in generation-time estimates translating into uncertainty in R.

Key to their analysis was the availability of detailed clinical and contact-tracing data for the first 205 cases in Singapore. These data enabled them to produce, as input for the model, prior distributions that characterize, without specifying them exactly, the person-toperson variability in infectious period, and the highly skewed distribution of secondary cases produced by an infected individual. The estimates they obtained for R contained considerable uncertainty -a mean of 3.5 with a range of 1.5-7.7 -which reflected the striking heterogeneity in transmission dynamics generated by the super-spreaders.

This type of technical advance might be useful as a practical tool for tracking the spread of pathogens (SARS or other small-genome pathogens) at the individual level in future outbreaks. Molecular typing could therefore make direct reconstructions of the epidemic tree (of the sort we discuss later for foot-and-mouth disease) a realistic possibility.

The estimated parameters showed an increased risk of infection of approximately 20-fold after exposure to vomit, indicating that during these episodes infected children are highly infectious super-spreaders of the virus. In this instance, the result confirms the conclusions of a more standard statistical analysis 67 . However, in less clear-cut cases, the need to include multiple factors in the model, for example within-and between-class mixing and exposure patterns, a time-varying force-of-infection and differing exposure times of the children, requires the framework of MCMC, which has the flexibility to combine dynamic processes, risk factors and surveillance data.

Progress in this area requires, as a crucial first step, greater familiarity of public-health and animalhealth scientists with mathematical modelling, and a greater familiarity of mathematical modellers with the requirements and expertise of public health and veterinary sciences. Louise Matthews has worked as a post-doctoral researcher, and currently as a research fellow, at the University of Edinburgh since 1997. Her research interests lie in the application of mathematical models to infectious-disease data to investigate within-host dynamics of disease pathogenesis, metapopulation dynamics and persistence of rare pathogens, control strategies and their optimal implementation, and identification of heterogeneities such as super-spreaders, which drive the spread of disease.",

The national movement ban and 'rapid' culling of livestock on infected farms were the only control measures in place on this date, but analysis of the epidemic curve indicates that the outbreak remained out of control. In such cases, accurate short-term predictions of the spread of infection could assist in alerting policy makers to the potential scale of the problem.Predicting the expected number of case reports requires several inputs: the existing number of infections; the reproduction ratio; the interval between becoming infected and passing on infection to another holding (referred to as the generation time); and the infection-to-reporting interval. Reconstruction of the outbreak using the method of Haydon et al.44 provided arithmetic means and distributions for these parameters for the first 2 weeks of the outbreak following the movement ban. A stochastic individual (farm)-based model used these distributions to simulate outbreak scenarios from 15 March onwards. Repeated simulations were conducted to produce upper and lower confidence limits on the estimated number of future reports. Our simulated scenarios predicted that the number of reported cases would double within 8-9 days, a forecast that was borne out by subsequent case report data (seeFigure). 532 | JULY 2005 | VOLUME 3www.nature.com/reviews",
