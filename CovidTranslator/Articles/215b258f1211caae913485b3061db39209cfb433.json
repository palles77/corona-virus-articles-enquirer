The gold nanoparticles showed target-specific aggregation with viral particles via hemagglutininsialic acid binding. A linear correlation was observed between the change in optical density and dilution of chemically inactivated influenza B/Victoria and influenza B/Yamagata. Virus dilution (hemagglutination assay titer, 512) of 0.156 vol% was readily detected. The upper limit of the linearity can be extended with the use of more sialic acid-gold nanoparticles.",

Hemagglutinin is a surface protein on various viral species that can bind to sialic acid on targeted cell surface (Sauter et al., 1992) . The binding of viral proteins to sialic acid has been studied for different pathogenic viruses, such as influenza virus (Sauter et al., 1992; Varghese et al., 1997; Weis et al., 1988) , human parainfluenza virus (Suzuki et al., 2001) , human coronavirus (Vlasak et al., 1988; Kunkel and Herrler, 1993) and a specific serotype of rhinovirus (Uncapher et al., 1991) . Based on the binding capability of sialic acid to certain viruses, it is possible to design a colorimetric sensor for detecting virus using self-reporting plasmonic nanoparticles, which display plasmon shift upon binding to viral particles. Such a quick and userfriendly detection method based on the binding between the influenza virus envelope protein hemagglutinin and sialic acid that is capable of effectively identifying individuals or animals infected with virus can help with early therapeutic intervention and reduce the spread of infection.",

Still, there have yet to be reported for actual virus detection. Herein we report the development of sialic acid stabilized gold nanoparticles (SA-AuNPs) through a simple one-pot synthesis and their use in the detection of two influenza virus type B, subtypes Victoria and Yamagata. In our method, sialic acid was used without any chemical modification which is often time consuming and costly, such as previously reported sialic acid functionalized gold nanoparticles (Niikura et al., 2009; Papp et al., 2010) .

Most of the hydroxyl and amine groups of SA-AuNPs are located at the opposite end to the carboxylic group. It is reasonable to project that the carboxylic group will face outward after SA-AuNPs are formed. The SA layer on AuNP surface prevents the aggregation of the AuNPs in solution. In the presence of viral particles, single AuNPs can attach to hemagglutinin on viral particle surface, resulting in shorter distance between AuNPs.

After adding dilutions of influenza B/Victoria to the SA-AuNPs solution, the OD value at 600-610 nm increases while that at 510 nm decreases over time. The increased absorbance at 600-610 nm indicates that AuNP aggregates have formed, thus decreasing the population of single AuNPs as they are converted into AuNP aggregate on the viral particle surface. The increase in absorbance at 600-610 nm is approximately 7 times that of decrease in absorbance at 510 nm, which is likely attributed to the enhanced scattering effect of aggregated AuNPs as compared to individual AuNPs.",

A solution containing 0.2 nM SA-AuNPs and 5 vol% of the medium was prepared and absorption spectrum was measured after 20 min (Fig. 4A ). Since the absorption spectrum of the medium overlaps somewhat with the plasmonic peak area of SA-AuNPs, absorption spectrum of the medium was subtracted from that of the SA-AuNPs and medium mixture (Fig. 4A, dotted line) matched well with that of SA-AuNPs in water, indicating that the presence of medium does not cause SA-AuNP aggregation. Additionally, the potential for virus binding nonspecifically to nanoparticles and cause aggregation was tested. Gelatin-AuNPs, with similar spherical shape and size distribution (Fig. 4B inset, diameter of $ 20 nm by TEM analysis) but lacking sialic acid were assayed for aggregation in the presence of viral particles. No change was observed in either the plasmonic band or the 600-700 nm region.

At higher concentrations of virus (e.g. 2.5 and 5 vol%), as ratio of virus to particles increases, the proportion of SA-AuNPs that can be bound to the same viral particle decreases. This results in longer interparticle distance between neighboring SA-AuNPs on the viral particle surface, and less signal. We carried out another set of colorimetric tests using a higher concentration of SA-AuNP solution (0.8 nM), while maintaining the same concentrations of virus solution. The results in Fig. 6E show that the linear range of DOD vs. concentration of added virus solution has extended to 2.5 vol% of virus in the solution. This illustrates the importance of having an excessive amount of SA-AuNPs in the starting solution when applying this scheme for virus detection. To validate these results with another virus preparation, influenza B/Yamagata subtype was also tested with 0.4 nM SA-AuNPs solution.

The SA-AuNPs can readily detect influenza B virus (HA titer of 512) diluted to 0.156 vol% and the upper limit of linearity can be extended to higher virus titer with a more concentrated SA-AuNP solution. The method works for different influenza B lineages (Victoria and Yamagata). Results from control experiments support the hypothesis that sialic acid molecules on SA-AuNP surface interact with viral envelope protein hemagglutinin, causing a colorimetric change of the SA-AuNP solution.",
