These novel compounds were evaluated for their cytostatic and antiviral activity in vitro against a panel of human malignant tumour cell lines and normal murine fibroblasts (3T3). Among all evaluated compounds, the 9-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (13) exerted the most potent inhibitory activity on the growth of CEM/0 cells (IC 50 \u00bc 4.1 \u00b1 1.8 mM) and strong antiproliferative effect against L1210/0 (IC 50 \u00bc 4.7 \u00b1 0.1 mM) while the 9deazahypoxanthine derivative of L-AA (15) showed the best effect against HeLa cells (IC 50 \u00bc 5.6 \u00b1 1.3 mM) and prominent effect on L1210/0 (IC 50 \u00bc 4.5 \u00b1 0.5 mM). Furthermore, the 9-deazapurine derivative disubstituted with two imino-L-AA moieties (18) showed the best activity against L1210/0 tumour cells (IC 50 \u00bc 4.4 \u00b1 0.3 mM) and the most pronounced antiproliferative effects against MiaPaCa-2 cells (IC 50 \u00bc 5.7 \u00b1 0.2 mM). All these compounds showed selective cytostatic effect on tumour cell lines in comparison with embryonal murine fibroblasts (3T3). When evaluating their antiviral activity, the 3deazapurine derivative of L-AA (3) exhibited the highest activity against both laboratory-adapted strains of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (AD-169 and Davis) with EC 50 values comparable to those of the well-known anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir and without cytotoxic effects on normal human embryonal lung (HEL) cells.",

Thus, 3-deazaadenosine, a potent inhibitor of S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase and an attractive target for the design of antiviral drugs, has shown significant activity against HSV-1, HIV and oncogenic DNA viruses [4] . 3-Deazaadenine derivatives of cyclopentyl adenine drugs aristeromycin and neoplanocin A retained their strong activity against HSV-1, vaccinia virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV) with lower cytotoxicity [5e8]. Also, 3-deazaguanosine has shown a wide spectrum of activity against DNA and RNA viruses as well as antitumoural activity [1] . C-2 and C-3 halogenated 3-deazapurine derivatives showed anti-HBV activity, a broad spectrum of antitumour properties [9] and strong ability of subtracting Mycobacterium tuberculosis adenosine kinase [4] . C-7 fluorinated and C-2 0 methylated derivatives of the naturally isolated antibiotic tubercidin (7-deazaadenosine) have shown strong inhibition of NS5B, a nonstructural hepatitis C protein, while C-7 halogenated also exhibited substantial activity against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [10e12] . Acyclic derivatives of sangivamycin (7-deazapurine broad spectrum antibiotic) showed the same antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HCMV as the reference drug ganciclovir, without cytotoxic effects. In addition, compound BMK-Y101 and its prodrug are preclinical candidates for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma [12] .

Condensation reaction in situ of silylated 3-deazapurine bases (A, B and C) and 5,6-di-O-acetyl-2,3-di-O-benzyl-L-ascorbic acid (dAd-BAA, synthesized as previously described [15] ) with FriedeleCrafts catalyst, trimethylsilyltrifluoromethane sulphonate (TMSOTf) afforded the new 3-deazapurine derivatives of L-ascorbic acid (1e4, Scheme 1) containing ethylenic spacer between two moieties. 2,6-Difluoro-3-chloro-3-deazapurine base (B) was synthesized in six steps as previously described by Liu, M.-C. et al. [9] while 3-bromo-3-deazapurine base (A) was synthesized by cyclization reaction of 3,4-diamino-5-bromopyridine with diethoxymethyl acetate (DEMA). 3-Bromo-3-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (1) was isolated as N-9 regioisomer and as a mixture of Z and E isomers in the ratio 4:1, while reaction between 3-deazapurine base B and dAd-BAA resulted in two regioisomers, N-9 as a Z isomer (2) and N-7 as a mixture of Z and E isomers (3) in the ratio 3:1. 6-Chloro-3deazapurine derivative of L-AA (4) was isolated as N-7 regioisomer in equal Z and E isomer amounts. Ammonolysis of compounds 1, 2 and 4 in dioxane and methanol gave compounds 5e7, bearing a hydroxy group at the C-4 of now imino-L-ascorbic acid (imino-L-AA). Also, substitution of the fluorine atom with amino group at the C-6 position of the 3-deazapurine base occurred in the synthesis of 3-deazapurine derivative of imino-L-AA (7) . Compound 4 underwent debenzylation with boron-trichloride (1 M in dichloromethane) which yielded the compound 8, 3deazapurine derivative of L-AA with free hydroxy groups at the C-2 and C-3 positions of L-AA, as mixture of Z and E isomers in the ratio 10:1.",

Condensation reaction of 7-deazapurine base (7-DP) D and dAdBAA in Vorbr\u00fcggen reaction conditions gave N-1 regioisomer of compound 9 (Z:E \u00bc 3:1) (Scheme 2). 6-Chloro-7-iodo-7-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (10) was not isolated under Vorbr\u00fcggen conditions, but was successfully obtained via reaction under Mitsunobu reaction conditions. Reaction between 7-deazapurine base E and 6-hydroxy-2,3-di-Obenzyl-4,5-didehydro-L-ascorbic acid (HdBAA) with triphenylphosphine (PPh 3 ) and diethyl azodicarboxylate (DEAD) afforded compound 10, 6-chloro-7-iodo-7-deazapurine substituted with 4,5-didehydro-5,6-dideoxy-L-ascorbic acid at N-9 position in the isomer ratio Z:E \u00bc 9:1 (Scheme 2). Ammonolysis of compounds 9 and 10 in similar procedures as for the synthesis of 3-deazapurine derivatives of imino-L-AA (5e7) gave 7-deazapurine derivatives of imino-L-AA 11 and 12, bearing the amino group at the C-4 chiral position of the lactame moiety (Scheme 2). As opposed to the structure of analogue derivatives of deazapurines and imino-L-AA described in this paper (5e7, 11 and 16e19) which contain ethyl spacer between deazapurine and lactame moieties, compound 12 contains ethylenic spacer between those two moieties with the double bond between C-5 and C-6 atoms. Structural difference of the products 11 and 12 may be explained by the mechanism from which these lactams arise. The mechanism of the formation of the lactams from L-ascorbic acid involves nucleophilic attack of the ammonia to the carbonyl group at C-1 of the lactone moiety with concomitant lactone ring opening and formation of the keto-enolic tautomers that subsequently close to form lactams [24] . Thus, our findings of the two structural different compounds 11 and 12 may be in accordance to that mechanism; the keto tautomer undergoes the nucleophilic attack of the amino group, followed by ring closure and formation of the lactame derivative 11, whereas the enolic tautomer undergoes the same nucleophilic attack followed by a consecutive shift of the double bond and formation of imino-L-AA derivative 12.",

NMR chemical shifts are reported in Table 1 ( 1 H), Experimental section ( 1 H and 13 C) and Supplementary data 1 and 2 ( 19 F and 15 N). 1 H decoupled 13 C NMR spectra showed CeF coupling constants that enabled straightforward identification of fluorinated carbon atoms and their neighbours. Notably, C-4 0 and C-5 0 displayed different multiplicity pattern due to the long-range coupling constants with two fluorine atoms in 2 and 3; C-4 0 is coupled to both fluorine atoms over three bonds ( 3 J \u00bc 4e12 Hz), whereas C-5 0 showed coupling constants over two ( 2 J \u00bc 27e34 Hz) and four bonds ( 4 J \u00bc 3e4 Hz).

In contrast, perusal of 2D NMR spectra of 3 showed a correlation signal between H-6 methylene protons (d 5.25 ppm) and C-5 0 (d 116.37 ppm) indicating that the reaction proceeded at the N-7 position of the deazapurine moiety. 15 N chemical shifts in deazapurine 3 corroborated that ascorbic acid is attached at N-7 position.

Test agents were then added in five, 10-fold dilutions (0.01e100 mM) and incubated for further 72 h. Working dilutions were freshly prepared on the day of testing in the growth medium. The solvent (DMSO) was also tested for eventual inhibitory activity by adjusting its concentration to be the same as in the working concentrations (DMSO concentration never exceeded 0.1%). After 72 h of incubation, the cell growth rate was evaluated by performing the MTT assay: experimentally determined absorbance values were transformed into a cell percentage growth (PG) using the formulas proposed by NIH and described previously [25] . This method directly relies on control cells number at the day of assay because it compares the growth of treated cells with the growth of untreated cells in control wells on the same plate e the results are therefore a percentile difference from the calculated expected value. The IC 50 values for each compound were calculated from doseeresponse curves using linear regression analysis by fitting the mean test concentrations that give PG values above and below the reference value. If, however, all of the tested concentrations produce PGs exceeding the respective reference level of effect (e.g. PG value of 50) for a given cell line, the highest tested concentration is assigned as the default value (in the screening data report that default value is preceded by a \">\" sign). Each test point was performed in quadruplicate in three individual experiments. The results were statistically analysed (ANOVA, Tukey post-hoc test at p < 0.05). Finally, the effects of the tested substances were evaluated by plotting the mean percentage growth for each cell type in comparison to control on dose response graphs.",

Compounds with the most pronounced antitumoural activities, the 9-deazapurine derivative of L-AA (13) and the 9-deazapurine derivatives of imino-L-AA (15 and 18) will serve as leading molecules for synthetic structure modifications with the aim to develop more selective and more active antitumoural substrates in this class of compounds.
