In comparison, elF-6 is a single polypeptide of about 25 kDa. The next step is the formation of the 43S ternary complex of met-tRNAi, GTP, and elF-2. This binds to the 40S subunit in the absence of mRNA. elF-2 is one of the most widely studied initiation factors and is known to contain three polypeptides, ct, 13, and ~, with molecular masses of 35, 38, and 52 kDa, respectively. The primary function of elF-2 is to bind met-tRNAi in a process that is dependent on GTP. Thereafter, through a process that is still largely a mystery, the binding of the 43S complex with mRNA occurs at its methyl-7-guanine (mTG) cap at the 5' end (NygS.rd and Nilsson, 1990) . Three initiation factors, elF-4A, 4B, and 4F, are required for optimal binding of mRNA while using one molecule of ATP. elF-4A is a highly conserved single-polypeptide chain of about 45 kDa and is characterized as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase involved in the unwinding of RNA. A particular feature of all putative RNA helicases is the presence of the D-E-A-D (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) amino acid sequence motif, thought to be associated with the processing of RNA. In comparison, elF-4B is a dimer of identical subunits of about 80 kDa and is necessary for the cross-linking of elF-4A to mRNA. elF-4F also contains two subunits of 26 kDa and 220 kDa, both of which interact with the mTG cap of the mRNA.",

The physical nature of this reaction remains controversial. There are thought to be two forms of elF-5 with molecular masses of 125 kDa and 60 kDa without, however, any differences in their biological properties (Hershey, 1991; Merrick, 1992) . The hydrolysis of GTP causes the release of the initiation factors from the surface of the 40S ribosomal subunit, and allows attachment of the 60S subunit by triggering the release of elF-6 from it. The formation of the 80S initiation complex culminates in the formation of the first peptide bond at the ribosomal P site. The initiation factor elF-4D is required for the formation of the first peptide bond. elF-4D is a small protein (about 16 kDa), and has a unique posttranslational modification of its lysine-50 residue by the action of a polyamine, spermidine, to form a hypusine residue essential for its activity (Hershey, 1991; Merrick, 1992) . Furthermore, in order to allow efficient and catalytic use of elF-2 after GTP hydrolysis and its release from the complex, another factor, elF-2B, facilitates the exchange of elF-2 bound GDP for GTP.",

Each mRNA can participate in multiple rounds of initiation, thus giving rise to a string of ribosomes called polysomes, engaged at different stages of translation. Polysomes can be observed both attached to the endoplasmic reticulum and in the cytoplasm. It is estimated that an efficiently translated mRNA at 37 ~ C initiates protein synthesis once every 5-6 s (Hershey, 1991) . How many times an mRNA can be translated depends on several aspects of its structure, including the context surrounding the AUG codon, and its lifespan expressed in terms of the rate of degradation (Ross, 1989; Kozak, 1991) . What is important in a biological context is that the initiation step is considered the main target for the regulation of protein synthesis during cell cycle, growth, development, hormonal response, and under stress conditions including heat shock, irradiation, and starvation. How this regulation is brought about will be discussed in a separate section.",

EF-1 usually occurs in multiple molecular forms, composed of varying amounts of EF-1 ct and EF-113T. Sequences of EF-lt~ genes, cDNAs and protein from more than 15 different species have been determined and found to be highly conserved during evolution. For example, in comparison with human EF-lct, the most distant eukaryotic sequence is that of tomato (78% homology), the closest nonmammal is Xenopus laevis (95% homology), whereas almost 100% homology exists among mammals (Riis et al., 1990a) .",

Furthermore, EF-loc appears to have several other functions in addition to its requirement in protein synthesis. For example, EF-1 ct has been reported to bind to cytoskeletal elements, particularly actin. It is associated with the endoplasmic reticulum, and is part of the valyl-tRNA synthetase complex; it is also associated with the mitotic apparatus, and is involved in protein degradation and ribosome association (Merrick, 1992) . Similarly, the role of an extra copy of the EF-1 ct gene in life prolongation, (e.g., transgenic Drosophila at high temperature, Shepherd et al., 1989) , and in an increase in the accuracy of protein synthesis in yeast cells (Song et al., 1989) indicate the pluripotent nature of this factor.",

This reaction is facilitated by the intrinsic activity of the ribosome. As a result of this reaction, the growing polypeptide chain becomes elongated without moving forward. The movement or translocation of the dipeptide-tRNA from :h~ A site to the P site is achieved by the action of EF-2, while another molecule of GTP is hydrolyzed. This process results in the relative movement of the mRNA by three nucleotides, so that a new codon becomes readable in the A site. The deacylated tRNA is pushed out of the ribosome after a transient halt at the so-called exit (E) site. At this point, all the components involved in the elongation cycle become ready to undergo the next cycle. In terms of energy consumption, the addition of each new amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain costs 4 high-energy phosphates from 2 molecules of ATP during amino-acylation and 2 molecules of GTP during elongation. Various estimates of the elongation rates in eukaryotic cells give a value in the range of 3-6 amino acids incorporated per ribosome per second, which is several times slower than the prokaryotic elongation rate of 15-18 amino acids incorporated per second (Hershey, 1991).",

However, most of the available evidence points towards elongation factors EF-1 and EF-2 as the main regulators of protein-elongation rates. For example, changes in the total-protein-synthesis rate have been correlated with the amounts and activities of EF-1 in mammalian cells in culture, both during the cell cycle and during aging, in rat and mouse organs during regeneration and aging, in rat spleen during the immune response, in sea urchin eggs after fertilization, and in a fungus Mucor during spore germination (Spirin and Ryazanov, 1991) . Similarly, the amount of active EF-2 has been reported to vary with the protein synthetic status of mammalian cells in different phases of the cell cycle and during aging (Riis et al., 1990b) .",

However, in recent years significant evidence has accumulated showing that in several instances a termination codon can be translated as a sense codon (nonsense suppression), or it can be skipped by frame-shift resulting in the synthesis of elongated proteins. For example, the opal termination codon, UGA, can be translated as trp in mitochondria, and UAA and UAG termination codons can be translated as gin in ciliates (Valle and Morch, 1988) . Similarly, owing to ribosomal frame-shifting (when a ribosome shifts from one reading frame to another at a position in the mRNA before reaching a termination codon), elongated proteins can be produced, such as during the expression of retroviruses and coronavirus in eukaryotes (Valle and Morch, 1988; Tate and Brown, 1992) . Furthermore, in some proteins, for example mammalian glutathione peroxidase, the incorporation of selenium-cysteine (Se-cys) is facilitated by an opal suppressor tRNA that can translate UGA as Se-cys (Valle and Morch, 1988) . Thus, although the termination step of protein synthesis is not a common site of regulation, in special cases it can regulate the rate and extent of expression of specific proteins.",
