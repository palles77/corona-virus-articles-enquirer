The infection in bulls is primarily acquired through direct sexual contact and is asymptomatic in nature affecting neither the semen quality nor the sexual behaviour although in some cases, early death of developing foetus has also been observed [5e7] . Literature rationale has also revealed that the parasite provoked cell death to bovine oviduct epithelial cells [8] and extracellular products secreted by T. foetus were cytotoxic to bovine sperm [9] . Although the use of artificial insemination in breeding cattle has led to the virtual eradication of this organism from the cattle population in many countries, bovine trichomonad infection still is responsible for significant economic losses in the free-ranging cattle industry around the world. In light of this current problem, the identification of new chemotherapies for this pathogen is still warranted.",

An extensive investigation on the synthetic versatility of isatin has disclosed many interesting aspects of organic synthesis allowing the generation of a large number of structurally diverse analogues derived from electrophilic aromatic substitution at positions C-5 and C-7 of the phenyl ring, nucleophilic additions onto the C-3 carbonyl group, chemoselective reductions, oxidations, ring-expansions, and spiroannulations [21] . However there are only few reports regarding the antineoplastic activities of N-alkyl and N-aryl isatins. Vine and coworkers have reported the apoptosis behaviour of N-alkyl/aryl isatins through introduction of various hydrophobic substituents like N-phenethyl, N-benzyl and N-2-naphthylmethyl on the parent nucleus that significantly increased their cytotoxicity towards lymphoma cells and against a wide range of human cancer cell lines, including MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast adenocarcinoma cells and U937 human monocyte-like histolytic lymphoma cells [22] . Recent report from our lab has shown the synthesis of N-alkylisatin along with their cytotoxic profiles against a panel of cancer cell lines [23] . The approach has been further extended towards the synthesis of 1H-1,2,3-triazole-tethered isatin conjugates with four of the synthesized scaffolds being twice as potent as 5-fluorouracil on THP-1 cell line [24] .",

Mechanistically, the reaction is thought to proceed by an initial formation of Cu-acetylide I which undergoes Mannich addition as shown in Scheme 1.

As evident from Table 1 , the anti-trichomonas activity of the test compounds were found to be dependent upon the nature of substituent at C-5 position as well as the presence of nature of secondary amine. The presence of a eCH 3 substituent at C-5 position of isatin ring of the synthesized Mannich adducts considerably improved the activity profile as evident by compounds 3ae3p and 5ae5d. Further, the introduction of 7-chloro-4-piperazin-1-yl-quinoline moiety remarkably improved the anti-trichomonas activity with a preference for halogen substituent at C-5 position of isatin ring. The most potent of the synthesized hybrids 7b and 7c showing 100% growth inhibition at 50 mM. The active compounds viz. 7a, 7b and 7c from the preliminary inhibition data were chosen in order to determine their IC 50 which is the minimum concentration required for 50% growth inhibition and the results are tabulated in Table 2 . As evident from Table 2 , although the synthesized conjugates are not as active as the standard drug metronidazole, the compounds showed potent activity against the veterinary protozoal pathogen T. foetus. The compound 7c having a chloro-substituent at C-5 position of the isatin ring proved to be the most potent of the synthesized scaffolds with an IC 50 of 11.3 mM. The synthesized compounds were further evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human prostate (PC-3) cancer cell lines in order to confirm if the observed activity profiles are because of their intrinsic anti-trichomonas activity or the cytotoxicity. The cytotoxic evaluation results of the test compounds at 0.2, 2.0 and 20 mM are enlisted in Table 1 . As evident, virtually all the synthesized Mannich adducts are devoid of cytotoxicity except 5a and 5f, showing that the bis-adducts were cytotoxic against PC-3 cell lines compared to the mono-adducts. The most potent anti-trichomonas scaffolds viz. 7a, 7b, 7c and 7d showed no cytotoxicity against PC-3 cell line and can be considered as a good hit.",

The synthesized scaffolds were evaluated for their activity against veterinary protozoal pathogen T. foetus. The preliminary evaluation data revealed that the introduction of 7-chloroquinoline ring markedly enhanced the activity profiles with the most active compound 7c exhibiting an IC 50 of 11.3 mM. The cytotoxic studies against human prostate (PC-3) cell lines showed that the synthesized Mannich adducts are virtually devoid of any cytotoxicity and the isatin-7-chloroquinoline framework can act as an ideal starting point for the synthesis of new pharmacological templates against T. foetus.",
