At the end of the nineteenth century, when the microbial The Nature and Classification etiology of many infectious disof Animal Viruses eases had been established, pathologists recognized that there since been discovered, but two still apply: (a) unlike even the smallest microorganisms (chlamydiae), viruses contain no functional ribosomes or other cellular organelles, and (b) in RNA viruses the whole of the genetic information is encoded in RNA, a situation unique in biology. Other distinctions apply to some but not all viruses, e.g., the isolated nucleic acid of viruses of several genera is infectious (i.e., the virus can be generated intracellularly from a single molecule of nucleic acid), and viruses of most genera contain either no virus-coded enzymes, or one or more enzymes that belong to particular classes (neuraminidases and nucleic acid polymerases). It is impossible to define viruses satisfactorily in a sentence or even a paragraph, bearing in mind both their intracellular states and the extracellular particles or virions. Virions consist of a genome of either DNA or RNA enclosed within a protective coat of protein molecules, some of which may be associated with carbohydrates or lipids of cellular origin. In the vegetative state and as \"provirus\" (see Chapter 5), viruses may be reduced to their constituent genomes, and the simplest \"viruses\" may be transmitted from one host to another as naked molecules of nucleic acid, possibly associated with certain cellular components. At the other extreme, the largest animal viruses, e.g., the poxviruses and the leukoviruses, are relatively complex.",

However, the operational division of viruses made according to type of host continues to be used by the majority of virologists most of the time, and it is significant that the International Committee on Nomenclature of Viruses (ICNV), although dedicated to a universal classification, operates through Subcommittees on Bacterial, Invertebrate, Plant, and Vertebrate Viruses (Wildy, 1971 ).",

Three structural classes were distinguished: isometric particles, which were usually \"naked\" but in some groups were enclosed within a lipoprotein envelope; long tubular nucleoprotein structures, always (with viruses of vertebrates) surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope; and in a few groups, a more complex structure. Accepting a number of new terms defined by Lwoff et al. (1959a) , Caspar and his colleagues analyzed the principles underlying the structure of simple viruses (review: Caspar, 1965).

The virus particles are nonenveloped straight rods, which consist of 2100 repeating polypeptide (chemical) units, which are the structural units and also, without clustering, constitute the capsomers. These protein molecules are arranged in a helical manner so that except at the ends of the particles every capsomer is in a structurally equivalent position in relation to the long axis of the rods. Many plant viruses and a few bacteriophages have similar nonenveloped tubular virions, their capsomers being arranged in helices whose pitch is characteristic for the virus group. Such viruses are structurally defined by their length and width, the pitch of the helix, and the number of capsomers in each turn of the helix.",

The best studied example, the nucleocapsid of Sendai virus, a paramyxovirus, is a helix about 1 /xm long and 20 nm wide, with a pitch of 5.0 nm (Finch and Gibbs, 1970) . There are about 2400 hourglass-shaped structural units in the nucleocapsid, with either eleven or thirteen units per turn of the helix. The structural units are single polypeptides with a molecular weight of about 60,000 daltons, arranged with their long axes at an angle of about 60\u00b0 to the long axis of the nucleocapsid, which therefore has a herringbone appearance in electron The Structure of Animal Viruses 9 micrographs (see Plate 3-16).

            "text": "Although the only detailed studies have been made on a few plant and bacterial viruses (review: Tikchonenko, 1969), it is clear that the interaction between the viral nucleic acid and the capsomers is different in nucleocapsids with helical and icosahedral symmetry. In tobacco mosaic virus, there is a maximum regular interaction between the single strand of viral RNA and the protein subunits which form a protective coat around it. A similar relationship probably exists in most animal viruses with tubular nucleocapsids, but in some viruses (e.g., influenza virus) the integrity of the tubular structure is destroyed by treatment with RNase but not by proteases, suggesting a different relationship of RNA and protein. In icosahedral viruses, on the other hand, there can be no such regular relationship of the nucleic acid and each polypeptide subunit. In the simplest isometric viruses, the folding of the flexible single-stranded RNA may have some regularity in relation to the capsomers and their constituent chemical subunits. X-ray diffraction studies of turnip yellow mosaic virus (Klug et al., 1966), for example, show that a significant portion of the single RNA chain is deeply embedded within the protein shell, large segments being intimately associated with the 180 structural units, which as hexamers and pentamers make up the 32 capsomers. The presence of the RNA in and about these positions enhances the definition of 32 capsomers seen in electron micrographs (Finch and Klug, 1966) . Except for some togaviruses, even the simple isometric viruses of vertebrates have a more complex structure than this, since they contain several virus-coded poly pep tides. One or more of these poly pep tides are known to be \"internal\" to the capsid and it is thought that these rather than the capsomers interact with the viral RNA. Reovirus particles have two concentric protein shells, each consisting of well-defined morphological units. The proteins of the larger DNA viruses are arranged in several layers, not all of which display symmetry. The internal proteins of many DNA viruses are highly basic and are thought to be bonded to the viral nucleic acid, constituting a core within the isometric capsid.",

Enveloped viruses contain 20-30% of lipid, all of which is found in the envelope. Chemical analyses show that the lipid is derived from the cellular membranes through which the virus matures by budding, but all the polypeptides of viral envelopes are virus-specified. Herpesvirus is the only virus of vertebrates that matures by budding through the nuclear membrane, and its envelope contains several virus-specified glycoproteins. All other enveloped viruses bud through cytoplasmic membranes, and contain one or more different polypeptides. The Togaviridae have an isometric core to which a lipid layer is directly applied, and virus-specified glycoprotein peplomers project from this. All animal viruses with tubular nucleocapsids are enveloped, and in these the lipid layer from which glycoprotein peplomers project is probably applied to a protein shell (the membrane protein; see Fig. 1 -1), which may be relatively rigid, as in Rhabdovirus, or readily distorted (as in the myxoviruses) so that in negatively stained electron micrographs the virions appear to be pleomorphic.",

International Codes of Nomenclature with rigid sets of rules, and Judicial Commissions to pass judgement on proposed names, have been set up for the naming of plants and of animals. An International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria and Viruses was approved in 1947 and has since been revised (Buchanan et ah, 1958). Although they are primarily concerned with nomenclature, all these Codes involve agreement upon a system of classification. Codes are based on \"acceptances,\" i.e., beliefs we would like to justify but are unable to prove, the principal one being that we are able to arrange living things in an orderly system that is indicative of both rank in a hierarchy and phylogenetic relationships (Cowan, 1966) . Classifications of animals and plants attempt to be scientific by deriving their taxa from a consideration of phylogenetic relatedness.

Indeed, nucleic acid hybridization may be too critical a method to be useful except for the comparison of closely related viruses, and less exacting tests for the similarity of viral genomes may be more pertinent when considering different viral species. Bellett (1967a,b) analyzed the data available in 1966 on the molecular weights and base ratios of the nucleic acids of different viruses. His results on the \"clustering\" of the viruses of vertebrates are consistent with the genera proposed by the ICNV (Wildy, 1971). However, newer knowledge about the fragmented nature of the genomes of some RNA viruses and of the varied modes of their transcription and translation (Baltimore, 1971b) suggests that these data, where available, should be added to the parameters used by Bellett.

Many serological types have been isolated from human sources. These have an antigen that is shared by all mammalian strains, but differs from the corresponding antigen of avian strains. Allocation to the genus is made primarily on the basis of the characteristic size and symmetry of the virion as seen in electron micrographs (icosahedron with 252 capsomers). Most adenoviruses are associated with respiratory infection and many such infections are characterized by prolonged latency. Some multiply in the intestinal tract and are recovered in feces.

When examined further, such viruses were found to be DNA viruses that multiplied in the nucleus, and have now been included in the genus Herpesvirus. Table 1 -4 shows some of the viruses now regarded as members of this genus; a more complete list is given by Andrewes and Pereira (1972). There is a group-specific antigen(s) associated with the nucleocapsids and demonstrable by immunodiffusion, and several type-specific antigens associated with the nucleocapsid and envelope. Some type-specific antigens crossreact (e.g., herpes simplex viruses type 1 and type 2 and B virus). Different herpesviruses cause a wide variety of types of infectious diseases, some localized and some generalized, often with a vesicular rash. A feature of many herpesvirus infections is prolonged latency associated with one or more episodes of recurrent clinical disease. This genus (irido = iridescent) was defined on the basis of several viruses of insects whose structure and nucleic acid content have been carefully studied 18 1. Nature and Classification of Animal Viruses (Bellett, 1968; Wrigley, 1969) . Several DNA viruses of vertebrates that are similar in morphology and certain other characteristics have been tentatively grouped with the genus Iridovirus (Table 1-5) . Like poxviruses, but unlike other DNA viruses, iridoviruses multiply in the cytoplasm. Their DNA consists of a single linear molecule, with a molecular weight of about 130-140 million daltons, and the virion is a large and complex nonenveloped icosahedron, with an outer shell composed of about 1500 capsomers. The vertebrate ''iridoviruses\" may be enveloped. Several enzymes are found within mature virions. The best studied of the vertebrate \"iridoviruses\" are some viruses of frogs, notably FV3 (review, Granoff, 1969); the most important economically is African swine fever virus (review, Hess, 1971). The poxviruses (pock = pustule) are the largest animal viruses, and contain a larger amount of DNA (160-200 million daltons of double-stranded DNA) than any other virus. The structure of the brick-shaped virion is complex, consisting of a biconcave DNA-containing core surrounded by several membranes of viral origin. There is a poxvirus group antigen which is probably an internal component of the virion, and can be demonstrated by complement fixation or gel diffusion tests. Several enzymes, including a transcriptase, are found within mature virions. Multiplication occurs in the cytoplasm and the virions mature in cytoplasmic foci. Occasionally, the virion may be released within a loose membrane derived from the cytoplasmic membrane. This is not essential for infectivity, and must be distinguished from the envelope of viruses that mature by budding through cellular membranes.",

They are an important cause of respiratory disease in man and other animals, and some of the avian influenza viruses may cause severe generalized infections. In contrast to the orthomyxoviruses, the paramyxoviruses (para = alongside; myxo = mucus) are enveloped viruses whose RNA occurs as a single linear molecule with a molecular weight of about 7 million daltons (Table 1-12) . The tubular nucleocapsid has a diameter of 18 nm and is about 1.0 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b9 long. It is enclosed within a pleomorphic lipoprotein envelope 150 nm or more in diameter; long filamentous forms with the same diameter also occur. Three serologically related viruses, those of measles, distemper, and rinderpest, have been tentatively allocated to the Paramyxovirus genus on the basis of the morphology of the virion and nucleocapsid; they do not have a neuraminidase; respiratory syncytial virus is different again.",

All members share a group-specific antigen. Envelope encloses \"granules\" 20-30 nm in diameter; some of these are cellular ribosomes. The Bunyamwera \"supergroup\" of arboviruses (Bunyamwera, a locality in Africa) was established by Casals (World Health Organ., 1967) to bring together a number of minor arbovirus groups linked by distant serological reactions between occasional \"bridging\" viruses. The subgroups of viruses included are shown in Table 1 -15. All these viruses, numbering well over 100, are known or suspected to be arthropod-borne. Morphologically, those that have been studied have enveloped roughly spherical virions 90-100 nm in diameter with a tubular nucleocapsid. Several other arboviruses serologically unrelated to those of the \"supergroup\" have a similar morphology (Table 1 -15). Their genome consists of single-stranded RNA probably occurring in several pieces; its molecular weight has not been determined. The outstanding characteristic of the genus Leukovirus (leuko = white) is that all members contain an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (\"reverse transcriptase\"). The viruses contain three or four pieces of single-stranded RNA, with a total molecular weight of 10 to 12 million dal tons, associated with a helical nucleocapsid, which is enclosed within a capsid with cubic symmetry.",

Subgenus A includes the \"C-type particle\" viruses, some of which cause leukemia-sarcoma and are currently being subjected to intensive study. The mammary tumor virus, which is the best known representative of the subgenus B, differs from viruses of subgenus A in morphology and maturation (\"B-type particles\") and shows no serological cross-reactivity with the murine viruses of subgenus A. Subgenus C includes a group of serologically related viruses that cause slowly progressive diseases in sheep. They have all the physicochemical properties of leukoviruses. Although they do not cause neoplastic disease, they will transform cells that are nonpermissive for viral growth (Takemoto and Stone, 1971). The viruses of subgenus D (foamy agents) include a number of viruses of monkeys, cats, and cattle, that have no known pathogenic potential but have been frequently isolated from tumors (as \"passenger viruses\") or healthy animals. They have a different morphology from other leukoviruses (Clarke et al., 1969) and produce an intranuclear antigen as well as cytoplasmic antigens in infected cells (Parks and Todaro, 1972), but they contain a reverse transcriptase and are much more resistant to UV irradiation than other RNA viruses. The rhabdoviruses (rhabdo = rod) are enveloped RNA viruses with singlestranded RNA of molecular weight 4 million daltons. The RNA is associated with a very regular double-helical nucleocapsid 5 nm in diameter, enclosed within a bullet-shaped shell that measures about 175 X 75 nm (Table 1-17) . Several arboviruses belong to this genus, which also includes rabies virus and the virus of hemorrhagic septicemia of trout. It has been claimed that rabies virus can be adapted to multiply in Drosophila melanogaster (Plus and Atanasiu, 1966).",

Because both can be transmitted orally it is better to use noncommital names for them, and \"serum hepatitis\" is now termed hepatitis B; infective hepatitis, hepatitis A. Study of these viruses has been greatly inhibited by the lack of susceptible laboratory animals (chimpanzees may get clinical hepatitis; marmosets and rhesus monkeys subclinical infection, while other laboratory animals are insusceptible), and the difficulty of obtaining reproducible cytopathic changes in cultured cells. The recognition in the sera of cases of serum hepatitis of lipoprotein particles of characteristic serological specificity, called \"Australia antigen/ 7 hepatitis-associated antigen (HAA), and now hepatitis B antigen (HB-Ag), has led to a great expansion in studies on the incidence and pathogenesis of hepatitis B, but the actual virions have not yet been unequivocally demonstrated (see Chapter 3).

We can only speculate about their origins and relationships to each other, except in cases where the relationship is very close. It seems likely that different viruses belonging to any one genus, and in at least some cases, different genera allocated to a particular family, may be phylogenetically related. No use-34 1. Nature and Classification of Animal Viruses fui suggestions can be made concerning the relationships between families or genera (except in some of the cases where genera have been allocated to the same family), a fact which underlines the undesirability at this stage of our knowledge of erecting any taxa at levels higher than the family.Two suggestions have been made concerning the origin of viruses: (a) that they are the result of progressive parasitic degeneration of microorganisms (Green, 1935) and (b) that they have developed from components of the cells of their hosts (Andrewes, 1966; Luria and Darnell, 1967) , or are indeed still a permanent part of the host's genome (Todaro and Huebner, 1972) . With our present knowledge of the morphological and chemical complexity of the poxviruses, it is not difficult to envisage these agents as being the next degenerate step in the series: bacterium, rickettsia, chlamydia. Although they resemble bacteria in most important respects, rickettsia and chlamydiae are, like viruses, obligate intracellular parasites lacking the metabolic equipment for independent multiplication.On the other hand, some DNA viruses could well have arisen from episomes, by the acquisition of genetic information specifying a protein coat. Even this may not be essential, if Diener's (1972b) observations on potato spindle tuber virus are confirmed and generalized. The two alternatives are not mutually exclusive; some viruses may have evolved from cellular organelles like chloroplasts or mitochondria, themselves probably derived from bacteria (Swift and Wolstenholme, 1969). It is difficult to see where most RNA viruses could have originated except from cellular RNA's.Comparing the nearest neighbor nucleotide doublet frequencies of the nucleic acids of several large and small viruses, Subak-Sharpe (1969) noted that the patterns shown by small viruses with genomes of less than 5 million daltons (two enteroviruses, three parvoviruses, two polyoma viruses, and two papilloma viruses), closely resembled the pattern of mammalian DNA. On the other hand, the doublet frequency patterns of several viruses with large genomes (two herpesviruses and a poxvirus) differed strikingly from that of mammalian DNA. The doublet patterns of three adenoviruses resembled each other and showed a slight resemblance to the pattern of mammalian DNA, which could derive from some earlier natural fusion of genomes, like that recognized as a laboratory artifact with adenoviruses and SV40 (see Chapter 7). This evidence supports the notion that the small viruses may have originated from vertebrate cells whereas the herpesviruses, poxviruses, and probably the adenoviruses did not. These large viruses may have originated from the nucleic acid of cells of a different phylum, or as suggested earlier, by parasitic degeneration of microorganisms.",
