To better understand the biological characteristics and pathogenicity of the current prevalent Chinese PEDV field strains, in this study, a highly virulent Chinese genotype GIIa PEDV strain, CH/HBXT/2018, was isolated and serially propagated using Vero cells. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that strain CH/HBXT/2018 contained novel insertion and deletion mutations in the S gene region relative to the classical strain and belonged to the genotype GIIa, similar to other recently isolated PEDV strains from China and the United States. Pig infection studies indicated that the CH/HBXT/2018 strain was highly virulent in suckling piglets, and the median pig diarrhea dose (PDD 50 ) was 8.63 log 10 PDD 50 /3 mL at 7 days postinfection (DPI). The results of the present study are important for future PEDV challenge studies and the development of new PEDV vaccines based on prevalent field strains for the prevention and control of PED in China.",

In October 2010, a widespread outbreak of PED caused by highly virulent PEDV variants that differed from the classical European strain CV777 occurred in China and resulted in high mortality and huge economic losses. Since then, PED outbreaks have increased significantly and spread rapidly nationwide [6, 7] . PEDV variants emerged in the United States starting in May 2013 and then spread rapidly throughout the nation. Many American, Asian and European countries, including Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Japan, South Korea, the Philippines, Thailand, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland have also reported outbreaks of PED [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

The PEDV genome is approximately 28 kb in length and is composed of a 5\u00b4 untranslated region (UTR), seven open reading frames (ORFs), and a 3\u00b4UTR [14] . The seven ORFs encode three non-structural proteins, namely ORF1a, ORF1b and ORF3, and four structural proteins, designated receptor-binding spike glycoprotein (S), envelope protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N) [15, 16] . ORF1a and ORF1b play vital roles in viral replication and transcription and may be related to cell adaptability and virulence [17] . The spike protein is a type I membrane glycoprotein consisting of S1 and S2 domains, which play important roles in receptor binding, cell membrane fusion, induction of host immune responses and virus neutralization by antibodies [18] . The E protein is important for viral budding, and loss of the E protein reduces viral virulence. The M protein can induce neutralizing antibodies and is the most abundant constituent of viral particles [19] . PEDV N binds to RNA, and capped N gene transcripts can improve replication rates during virus rescue [20] .",

From 1986 to 2010, PED caused by the classical European strain CV777 was mostly regional and occurred sporadically in China but did not cause significant economic losses to the swine industry [22] . In 2010, a largescale epidemic caused by a PEDV strain with sequences that were distinct from those of CV777 caused outbreaks in China resulting in high morbidity and mortality and serious economic losses [22] . In the past, many commercial vaccines, such as killed/inactivated or attenuated PEDV vaccines based on the classical CV777 strain, were widely used on Chinese pig farms and played an important role in the prevention and control of PED [2] . However, since 2010, new highly virulent PEDV variants characterized by partial insertion and deletion mutations in the S gene relative to classical strains became prevalent in China. These new highly virulent PEDV variants belong to the GII genogroup and cause 50-100% mortality. Commercial vaccines based on the classical strain do not provide effective protection against these variants [26] . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new vaccines based on current, prevalent, highly virulent PEDV variants. Improved understanding of the biological characteristics and pathogenicity of currently prevalent Chinese PEDV variants is very important for the prevention and control of PED in China. For this purpose, we isolated and passaged a current, prevalent, highly virulent Chinese genotype GIIa PEDV strain, CH/HBXT/2018 (GenBank accession number MH816969), in Vero cells, and we investigated its biological characteristics and pathogenicity.",

Compared to the classical strains CV777 and DR13, the highly virulent PEDV variants of the GII genogroup show insertion, deletion and substitution mutations in the S gene, suggesting that the increased virulence of PEDV variants is mainly due to mutations in the S gene [15, 25, 26] . Analysis of the S protein sequence of CH/HBXT/2018 showed that it contains typical insertions and deletions that have also been found in other recently isolated highly virulent PEDV variants from China and other countries. The consistency of the S gene sequence between the CH/HBXT/2018 strain and currently, prevalent, highly virulent PEDV variants suggests that the CH/ HBXT/2018 strain may provide better protection than classical strains against currently, prevalent, highly virulent PEDV variants. However, this hypothesis requires further evaluation.",

In this study, typical PEDV clinical symptoms and intestinal pathological damage were observed in pigs infected with strain CH/HBXT/2018, and the PDD 50 of the CH/HBXT/2018 strain was determined to be 8.63 PDD 50 /3 mL at 7 dpi. Compared to the PC22A PEDV strain (7.83 log 10 PDD 50 /3 mL, 24 hpi) [25] , the infectious titer of the CH/HBXT/2018 strain was higher (8.63 log 10 PDD 50 /3 mL, 7 dpi).
