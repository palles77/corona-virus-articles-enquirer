This procedure has also been used in other pulmonary diseases such as desquamative interstitial pneumonia with good results. We describe a case of extremely severe respiratory failure due to concurrence of PAP and Influenza A H1N1 virus pneumonia which resolved with the help of this procedure. The patient, a 41year-old woman, needed less mechanical ventilation after undergoing lobar fiberoptic bronchoscopic lavage. Moreover, a rapid and progressive improvement in the computed tomography of the lungs was observed. Flexibile fiberoptic bronchoscopic lobar lavage is a simple, safe procedure used not only in milder disease, but also in particular severe cases in which the physiological derangement of whole lung lavage would not be tolerated by patient or when extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is not available.",

            "text": "Lobar or total lung lavage by flexibile fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) is an alternative to whole lung lavage (WLL) in the treatment of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP). [1] [2] [3] [4] Bronchopulmonary lavage was introduced by J. Ramirez and used not only in alveolar proteinosis but also in status asthmaticus 5 and in desquamative interstitial pneumonia 2 with good results.The use of multiple segmental or lobar lavage by FOB has been reported in English medical literature in less than 10 cases but often with interesting results. [1] [2] [3] [4] 6 Partial lung lavage, performed with bronchoscope has been considered a possibility when WLL is potentially harmful as in the case of severe hypoxemia and when extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is not feasible. 7 This option is also indicated for children. Since there is no pediatric-size double-lumen endotracheal tube available,unilateral lung lavage by bronchofiberscope and selective ventilation, with cuffed endotracheal tube, is an alternative. 7 Paquet and Karsli also utilized a twocuffed endotracheal tube for the treatment of a pediatric patient. 8 Based on these experience we report a case of a patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and presenting an influenza A H1N1 pneumonia treated and resolved with helping of FOB.",

The clinical presentation of PAP varies from asymptomatic (31% of acquired cases) to a more chronic presentation with dyspnoea and cough sometimes accompanied by sputum described as white and gummy or chunky. 9 Pulmonary function test usually reveals restrictive lung disease, decreased carbon monoxide diffusion capacity and rarely hypoxemia. Chest CT scan findings are non-specific and often show smooth thickening of sepal lines superimposed on areas of ground-glass opacities, known as crazypaving. 10 The gold standard for PAP diagnosis is open lung biopsy. Bronchoalveolar lavage is usually performed to exclude infection. The classic findings include a milky fluid containing large amounts of granular cellular eosinophilic (proteinaceous) material with morphologically abnormal foamy macrophages filled with PAS-positive intracellular inclusions. When electron microscopy is available, the presence of concentrically laminated phospholipid structures called lamellar bodies can confirm the diagnosis. 9,11 Associated infections have been reported in 5-20% of PAP cases. The infectious agents include Nocardia, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, Pneumocystis jirovecii, and cytomegalovirus. 11 An association with influenza A has not reported. Single lung lavage by FOB was performed in conscious patients as well as patients under general anaesthesia and mechanical ventilation; [7] [8] [9] [10] [12] [13] [14] in recent years the use of BAL lung lavage has increased; it seems to be effective as whole lung lavage. 7, 8, [12] [13] [14] It has similar long-term effects when compared with the latter. BAL lung lavage a is well-known and established procedure in primary pulmonary alveolar proteinosis. 1,3-5,7-8,12-14 BAL lung lavage was previously used in other pulmonary alveolar disorders. 2 The only effective treatment of PAP is bronchoalveolar lavage: the procedure is safe and does not require anesthetic support. It is recommended only in milder disease or conversely, in particular severe cases, in which the physiological derangement of WLL would not tolerated by patient or when extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation is not available. Our case report illustrates that extremely severe respiratory failure can be successfully managed with the alternative technique of lobar lung lavage by flexibile fiberoptic bronchoscopy. ",
