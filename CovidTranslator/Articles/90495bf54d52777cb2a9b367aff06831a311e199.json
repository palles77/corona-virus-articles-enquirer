This can be done using three basic assays: antigen detection, nucleic acid detection, and viral cultivation. For antigen detection, cellular materials (mucosal swabs, fluid sediment, tissue impressions, and fixed tissues) on glass slides can be probed by fluorescent or immunoperoxidase-labeled specific antibody. Although rapid and inexpensive, these assays have relatively low sensitivity. For some pathogens, specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests are available. These include feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and parvoviral infections (canine parvovirus type 2 [CPV-2] and feline panleukopenia [FPL] ). Sensitivity of these assays is regarded as high. Nucleic acid detection involves polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplification of the viral genetic material in biologic samples, including blood, mucosal swabs, feces, and fresh or fixed tissues. These assays are relatively fast and very sensitive. Viral cultivation, done on fresh samples, remains the gold standard but may take several (1 to 4) weeks. Serological analysis of the dam may provide information of previous infection or vaccination status but is often inconclusive.",

The critical periods are Neonatal and puppy-kitten mortality rates (animals dying before 1 year of age) are often used as clinical indicators of the general level of health in the community, including the level of vaccination that is used in the area (Table 16-1) . Infectious diseases are a major threat to the health of neonatal animals and may contribute to the mortality rate. Neonatal puppies and kittens depend in large part on the presence of sufficient maternal immunity, which provides short-term, passive immunity to protect them against microbial pathogens in the neonates' environment. The severity of clinical symptoms (disease) in puppies and kittens that may result from infectious microorganisms depends on several key factors (Box 16-1). In addition to current maternal passive immunity, they include preexisting maternal infection status, maternal and neonatal nutrition, neonatal thermoregulation, concurrent neonatal infections and parasitism, and hereditary defects of the immune system. Viral pathogens in particular can be life threatening for the neonate because for most infections, no specific antiviral therapy is available. Spread within a litter can be rapid as a result of the contagious nature of these pathogens. Adults with subclinical infections, including the dam, can be an important source of infection. Although some viruses, such as the feline retroviruses, are relatively labile outside the carrier host, others such as feline calicivirus and canine parvovirus are extremely hardy and can persist for months in contaminated environments. Transmission from dam to offspring can occur in utero or during birth of the neonate, whereas others are transmitted via nursing or grooming. The efficiency of the various modes of transmission varies with the agent involved.",

The virus can be carried by adult dogs in the respiratory tract and is commonly shed in aerosols. The virus is enveloped and highly susceptible to environmental and chemical inactivation. Although there is only one serotype of CDV, there are numerous strains that vary in their tissue tropism and pathogenicity. Although considered a disease of domestic dogs, many other canids are equally susceptible, as are mustelids (e.g., ferrets). Felines are reported to be infected, but clinical symptoms are rare except in exotic felines (e.g., lions, tigers). The route of infection with CDV is usually by aerosols, saliva, or grooming. The virus spreads rapidly to the oropharyngeal lymphoid organs, where it then enters the first of two viremic phases. During the first phase, there is generalized immune suppression. There may be fever, anorexia, and mild respiratory symptoms during this phase (7 to 10 days postinfection). During the second viremic phase, the virus is more disseminated to the GI tract, central nervous system, and skin. Hemorrhagic diarrhea may occur 10 to 20 days postinfection. Mortality rate in dogs symptomatic with this form may be as high as 50%. In classic forms of distemper, conjunctivitis is observed first, followed by a dry cough. The cough becomes progressively wet and productive, concurrent with oculonasal discharge. The discharge becomes mucopurulent within several days. Affected dogs are usually pyretic (>104\u00b0 F, 40\u00b0 C), depressed, and anorectic. It is estimated that at least 50% of CDV infections are subclinical and that dogs may shed virus for up to 60 days postinfection. and immunization with modified live CPV-2 vaccines of adult dogs in the population and the susceptible puppies (Table 16 -3).

Queens infected during gestation have aborted secondary to severe respiratory disease, but no placental lesions were found. Recrudescence of latent infections may occur during queening, leading to exposure of the kittens. Infected kittens may exhibit mild conjunctivitis and serous ocular and nasal discharge; those with insufficient passive immunity may develop severe clinical disease with lower respiratory tract involvement. Secondary bacterial infection may occur following infection, and mortality rates may be high. Affected kittens are inactive, anorectic, and exhibit profuse mucopurulent oculonasal discharge and respiratory distress. In kittens that have not yet opened their eyes, accumulation of purulent material behind the eyelids may occur, leading to noticeable distention. Viral detection through virus isolation from clinical samples (mucosal swabs antemortem or respiratory tract tissues postmortem) remains the gold standard but may take 2 days to 2 weeks for results. Antigen detection may be done on cells collected from mucosal surfaces or tissue impressions using immunofluorescence. Alternatively, nucleic acid detection on mucosal swabs or tissues using PCR can be done. These latter two assays have a fast turnaround time and are relatively inexpensive. For antigen detection, sensitivity is low to moderate, whereas PCR is high in sensitivity but may detect subclinical or even latent infection. Antiviral therapy is an option for FHV, although the safety of these regimens in neonatal kittens is not known. In vitro nucleotide analogs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir have shown efficacy. L-lysine is used to minimize recrudescent episodes and functions as an antagonist to arginine uptake, thus inhibiting FHV replication.

Cats with ELISA-positive results only may clear the virus, but this is unlikely in kittens aged less than 16 weeks as compared with adults. Serial testing in kittens born to infected queens may be necessary to confirm their infection status. Genetic detection by PCR is not routinely done, as antigenemia-negative cats are unlikely to be infected; however, at least one investigation has indicated that a small minority of infected cats may remain latently infected with nonreplicating virus capable of reactivation and detectable only by PCR.",

The primary target cell is the T-helper lymphocytes, but the virus also infects cytotoxic T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and some epithelial, fibroblast, and neural cell lines. As with FeLV, the replication cycle involves conversion of the RNA genome into dsDNA and integration into host cell DNA. It is shed in saliva and is transmitted efficiently by penetrating bite wounds. Other body fluids are also infectious, and transmission to kittens may occur in utero or via vaginal fluids or milk. The former is not as significant as a mode of transmission as the latter unless the queen is suffering acute infection, has declining CD4+ lymphocyte levels, or is in an advanced disease state. Transmission via milk or grooming by the queen is more likely to result in transmission to the offspring. One study has indicated that the virus is concentrated in milk in early lactation.",

These asymptomatic carriers are usually the source of viral infections to puppies and kittens early in life. Other sources of viral infections are the environment where wildlife cohabitate and interspecies infections between animals in the same household or facility. As was mentioned in Chapter 14, the dam and queen are unusually susceptible to infections and to exacerbation of preexisting infections as a result of temporary immune suppression. The immunologically naive neonatal puppy and kitten are equally susceptible to infections. Several viral infections that have emerged during the past few years are more virulent strains of CCV causing enteritis and respiratory disease, more virulent calicivirus strains affecting both dogs and cats, and influenza strains being spread from horses to dogs (canine influenza) and from birds to cats (avian influenza). More virulent strains of CDV have been reported within some dog populations, as well as in large felids. The clinical recognition of unusual outbreaks of viral disease will most likely occur initially in pregnant animals and neonates and then proceed to susceptible animals before involving the general population of dogs and/or cats.",

Although there are several mechanisms whereby a virus may persist in an animal population, interspecies spread or crossover has become of particular interest. This is because interspecies spread hampers control efforts in a population and may allow for emergence of new strains of multihost viruses. There are three particular types of dogs and cats that are susceptible to interspecies viral and bacterial spread. This susceptibility is directly correlated with the immune status of the host (see Chapter 14). The three types are pregnant animals, neonatal animals, and those animals that have genetic or acquired immunodeficiencies. The viruses that have been reported to cross over include canine distemper to cats, feline calicivirus to dogs, canine coronavirus to cats, and CPV-2 variants to cats. Another source of potential interspecies spread occurs from immunization of high-risk animals with contaminated vaccines. This occurred when a MLV canine vaccine that contained bluetongue virus was used in pregnant dogs. The vaccine was administered to booster maternal antibody but proved to be fatal for the puppies and a high percentage of the pregnant dogs. Nonpregnant dogs that received the contaminated vaccine did not develop clinical symptoms, and there was no evidence that further virus spread occurred.",

The syndromes are multifactorial in nature and are generally used to describe litters of puppies or kittens that fail to thrive (see Chapter 11). The syndromes can occur from birth up to 9 to 10 weeks of age. The affected neonates decline quickly, and the mortality rate can be high. There are at least three potential causes for these syndromes. They include environmental effects, genetic effects, and infectious microorganisms. The environmental effects include hypothermia or hyperthermia. Neonates that are too cold or too warm are unable to nurse and digest food correctly. Heart rates become erratic, and respiratory systems may collapse. Maternal factors that contribute to these syndromes are dams that are overweight and maternal neglect leading to inadequate colostral antibody intake.",
