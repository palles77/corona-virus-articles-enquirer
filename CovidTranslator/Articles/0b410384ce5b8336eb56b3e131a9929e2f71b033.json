Determination of appropriate isolation precautions for hospitalized pediatric patients with potential respiratory coinfection is an important intervention to prevent health care-associated infections (HAI). 10 Cohorting of patients with clinical bronchiolitis symptoms has also been recommended in centers without private patient rooms for all admissions. However, because clinical bronchiolitis may be caused by more than 1 etiologic agent, 10 the use of rapid respiratory testing platforms gives clinicians information that may allow for more focused isolation and cohorting of patients in real time. The study hypothesis is that the use of combined isolation precautions should be continued, even after the H1N1 pandemic, in pediatric patients with URI symptoms based on the detection of pathogen coinfections by use of a small volume polymerase chain reaction (SVPCR) array respiratory panel (RP) that requires both droplet and contact isolation precautions. This SVPCR array RP is the first US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved molecular method capable of detecting 17 viral and 3 bacterial respiratory pathogens and has been compared with other molecular testing methods. 11, 12 ",

This SVPCR array RP assay is rapid, takes 2 minutes of hands-on time/sample, and does not require special molecular training for the operator. This SVPCR array RP detected at least 1 pathogen in 344 (69%) of the 499 NP samples, whereas standard RAT and virus culture techniques detected only 99 (20% of the total and 29% of those with SVPCR array RP-detected pathogens). This rate is in the middle of the range of other studies using molecular methods for respiratory pathogen detection, which reported positive rates ranged from 46% to 93%. 5,15-18 Based on SVPCR array RP results, there was a significant difference in the number of children 24 months and younger with a detected pathogen compared with those aged 25 months and greater. This difference may be related to the developing immune system of the younger age group, lack of previous virus exposure during early life, or to possible colonization. 17 Those 25 months and older presenting with URI symptoms may have various other non-SVPCR array RP tested pathogens causing their symptoms. The FDA-cleared SVPCR array RP assay package insert reports 87.4% to 100% sensitivity and 94.6% to 100% specificity, based on pediatric and adult data (65% were children 5 years) obtained from the prospective clinical evaluation of the SVPCR array RP assay (excluding Bocavirus). 19 In our patient population, coinfection with 2 or more pathogens, including the 3 bacteria included in the SVPCR array RP, was noted in 57 (17%) of 344 SVPCR array RP-positive specimens, with 8 of these having 3 detected pathogens. Other investigators have also reported \"mixed\" viral infection or coinfection in children. One study from Finland, utilizing both PCR and diagnostic assays, including serology, noted mixed viral infections in 57 of 293 (19%) samples. In their study, as in ours, respiratory rhinoviruses/ enteroviruses were among the most commonly identified viruses in mixed infection. 16 A study from France found that 21.4% of PCRpositive nasal aspirate samples contained at least 2 viruses. 20 Additionally, a German group reported that 16.1% of their pediatric patients with acute respiratory tract infection had positive test results for more than 1 virus. 21 Two molecular studies from Seattle, WA, detected viral coinfection in 18% of their patients with at least 1 identified viral pathogen 17 and in 23% of their pediatric patients with symptoms of bronchiolitis. 18 Neither of these reports suggested that testing to identify respiratory picornaviruses was performed. 17, 18 However, in a multicenter study, Mansbach et al reported that 28.9% of infants and children up to 2 years of age with bronchiolitis had multiple pathogens detected, including rhinovirus. 5 The identification of viral coinfection has been associated with differing clinical outcomes. For example, Aramburo et al 22 used real-time PCR to detect respiratory viruses in critically ill children with respiratory tract disease and reported that 70.5% of the children sampled had 1 viral pathogen and that 14.5% of these patients had viral coinfections. Patients with viral coinfections had higher mortality rates, although this was not statistically significant. 22 In another study of patients with hematologic disorders, no significant differences were noted in presentation or outcome between episodes of febrile neutropenia caused by bacterial infection and those caused by mixed viral and bacterial infections. 23 Some combinations of pathogens, especially coinfection with RSV, have been associated with longer length of stay. 5 Treatment of infants and young children with URI or bronchiolitis symptoms may not be altered by viral testing or pathogen identification. 2 However, for patients hospitalized with URIs, for whom private rooms are not available, cohorting has been recommended. 10 Additionally, isolation precautions are employed to prevent transmission of specific pathogens with known methods of transmission (ie, aerosols or contact) to minimize the risk of HAI. 10 RSV transmission may be optimally prevented by the use of contact isolation precautions (gown and gloves), whereas spread of rhinovirus and influenza is prevented by droplet precautions (mask).",

[15] [16] [17] [18] [24] [25] [26] [27] The clinical significance of the multiple pathogens identified both by quantitative (viral load) and qualitative methods (present study) has been questioned before and has been variously reported to have different degrees of clinical importance. 17, [26] [27] [28] The detection of dead or noninfectious virus particles by molecular assays is theoretically possible, as is the possibility of asymptomatic carriage. 1, 5 For example, the SVPCR array RP detects Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, which have been reported to persist long after active infection has resolved. 14 The clinical relevance and transmissibility of these 2 agents require clinical correlation. In contrast, B pertussis is thought not to cause prolonged NP colonization but may become undetectable, even by molecular techniques, shortly after the characteristic whoop develops. This suggests that positive results for B pertussis may indicate detection of a true pathogen, as was noted in 2 of our patients with coinfections. Heininger et al suggested that coinfections of viruses, such as RSV and hMpV, with Bordetella spp are rare. 25 If viral coinfection does truly increase disease severity, it may be that multiple infections are overrepresented in study samples from patients seeking evaluations in the ED and especially in those admitted to the hospital.

Many of these required combined contact and droplet isolation precautions. Therefore, our center has continued the use of combined isolation (contact and droplet) precautions for hospitalized children with URI symptoms yearround. This is maintained for all in-patients with URI symptoms for the duration of the illness or until hospital discharge. Patients placed in combined isolation are cohorted upon admission when private rooms are not available. Although cohorting of patients should be based on symptoms because of the range of pathogens we cannot culture and for which no rapid diagnostic tests exist, the full impact of rapid respiratory testing platforms, such as the SVPCR array RP, may allow for more focused isolation and cohorting of patients in the future and needs further study.",

Hospital epidemiologists at CHM track and report HAI rates for RSV, as detected by RAT or culture, during January through April for annual benchmarking. No other HAI respiratory viruses were routinely monitored. For the 3 years prior to initiation of combined droplet and contact isolation (2006) (2007) (2008) , the average RSV HAI rate per 1,000 patient days was 0.25 (16 RSV cases; unpublished data). During 2009 to 2011, after the implementation of combined isolation, the rate was 0.15 (9 RSV cases; unpublished data). This difference is not significant (P \u00bc .478). However, targeted infection control interventions, including specific viral testing, isolation precautions, and cohorting, have been reported to be associated with prevention of HAI and cost savings at other centers. 4 The low number of influenza A strains detected may have reflected the timing of the influenza seasons. During the winter of 2009-2010, influenza peaked between October and December. During the winter of 2010-2011, almost all the influenza occurred during January through March. Thus, little influenza was detected by any methodology during our study periods.",

However, those same patients often had negative RAT and viral culture results because of limitations in sensitivity and in inherent detection capabilities of these assays. Nearly 70% of our patients with URI symptoms (73% of those aged 24 months) had positive SVPCR array RP results for at least 1 pathogen. Coinfection was present in 11% of all tested and 17% of those testing positive for at least 1 pathogen. Because of the pathogens and pathogen combinations detected in 11% of all participants tested, our study findings suggest that combined contact and droplet isolation precautions (gown, gloves, and mask) may be warranted to prevent HAI in pediatric inpatients with URI. Further studies will be needed to confirm these findings and to assess the effect of combined isolation precautions on prevention of HAI in pediatric hospitals.",
