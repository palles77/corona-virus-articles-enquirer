            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a murine coronavirus, replicates in the cytoplasm and synthesizes 7 viral mRNAs containing an identical stretch of leader RNA sequences at the 5'-end of each RNA. The leader-coding sequences at the 5'-end of genomic RNA are at least 72 nucleotides in length and are joined to the viral mRNAs by a unique mechanism. Utilizing a leader-specific cDNA probe, we have detected several free leader RNA species ranging from 70 to 82 nucleotides in length. The predominant leader RNA was approximately 75 nucleotides. In addition, larger distinct leader-containing RNAs were also detected ranging from 130 to 250 nucleotides in length. The 70-82-nucleotide leader-related RNAs were present in both the cytosol and membrane fractions of infected cells. They were also detected only in the small RNA fractions but not associated with the replicative-intermediate RNA. These data suggest that the leader RNAs were associated with the membrane-bound transcription complex but at least part of them were dissociated from the RNA template. We have also identified a temperature-sensitive mutant, which synthesizes only leader RNA but not mRNAs at nonpermissive temperature, indicating that leader RNA synthesis is distinct from the transcription of mRNAs. These data support the leader-primed mechanism for coronavirus transcription and suggest that one or more free leader RNAs are used as primers of mRNA synthesis.

            "text": "Seven virus-specific mRNAs ranging from 0.6 to 5.4 X 10' daltons are detected on polysomes of virus-infected cells (Lai et al., 1981 (Lai et al., , 1982a Leibowitz et al., 1981; Spaan et al., 1981) . These RNAs are arranged in the form of a nested set from the 3'-end of the genome such that the sequences of each smaller RNA are contained within the 3'-sequences of the next larger RNA species (Lai et al., 1981) . In addition to this unique genetic arrangement, it has recently been demonstrated that each mRNA and genomic RNA contain an identical stretch of approximately 72 nucleotides at their 5'-ends (Lai et al., 1983 (Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et al., 1983) . The presence of a leader RNA common to all viral mRNAs indicates that they are synthesized by joining two noncontiguous RNA segments, since the leader sequences are encoded only at the 5'-end of the genomic RNA (Lai et al., 1983 (Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et al., 1983) . These data suggest that a unique mechanism of RNA synthesis occurs during MHV infection. This mechanism differs from conventional eukaryotic RNA splicing since UV transcriptional mapping studies indicate that these mRNAs are not derived from cleavage of large precursor RNAs (Jacobs et al., 1981) . The study of replicative-intermediate RNA further suggests that the leader RNA is joined to the mRNAs during transcription, but not post-transcriptionally (Baric et al., 1983) . We have also shown that the double-stranded replicative form (RF) is of genome length, suggesting that the joining mechanism does not involve 'looping out' of intervening sequences in the (-)-stranded RNA template since such a mechanism would have generated subgenomic RFs (Baric et al., 1983) . Thus, these data are compatible with a model in which the coronavirus leader RNA is synthesized independently and then sequestered to prime transcription of the body sequences of each mRNA by binding specific initiation sites on the (-)-strand template (Baric et al., 1983) . This unique mechanism is supported by sequence data from mRNAs 6 and 7 (Armstrong et al., 1984; Spaan et al., 1983; Skinner and Siddell, 1981) , which demonstrate the presence of sequence complementarity between the 3'-portion of the leader RNA and intergenic 'start' sites on the (-) strand. Presently, the exact length of the leader RNA is not known but must consist of 57 nucleotides from the S-end of the genome plus at most 15 nucleotides which are complementary to the splice junctions on the (-)-stranded RNA (Spaan et al., 1983) . In this communization, we demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of small leader-containing RNAs in M~V-infected cells. Moreover, we have isolated a temperature-sensitive mutant which accumulates a leader RNA of approximately 72 nucleotides in length at the nonpermissive temperature. These data support the 'leader-primed' mechanism for coronavirus transcription (Baric et al., 1983) and demonstrate another mode of RNA synthesis in eukaryotic cells. The implications of these findings will be discussed.",

            "text": "It has previously been determined that the length of the leader RNA is approximately 72 nucleotides (Armstrong et al., 1984; Lai et al., 1984) . This estimate was obtained by primer extension of a synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide (5'-AGTT-TAGA'M'AGATT-3') (15-mer), which is complementary to a portion of the splice junction sites of MHV mRNAs 6 and 7 (Lai et al., 1984; Spaan et al., 1983) and also by sequencing of cDNA clones (Armstrong et al., 1984; Spaan et al., 1983) . Because of the presence of 15 homologous nucleotides between the 3'-end of the leader RNA and the start site of mRNA No. 7 on the MHV genome (Fig. f) , it has been suggested that the splice junction lies within a stretch of 15 nucleotides (AAUCUAAUCUAAACU) (nucleotides 58-72 from the 5'-end) (Lai et al., 1984; Spaan et al., 1983) . However, the exact length of the leader-coding sequences at the 5'-end of the genomic RNA is not clear. To determine the size of the leader-coding sequences on the genome, we purified the 72-nucleotide leader-specific cDNA made from mRNAs 6 and 7, using the previously described synthetic 15-mer as a primer for reverse transcription (Lai et al., 1984) . This leader cDNA was hybridized to purified 60s genomic RNA and digested with S, nuclease. No alteration in the size of the 72nucleotide cDNA was observed (Fig 2) . The minor DNAs seen in Lane A were probably due to random degradation, or the presence of contaminating truncated leader cDNAs, since longer exposure revealed similar patterns in the undigested leader cDNA control (Lane B). However, minor heterogeneity of genomic RNA cannot be ruled out. The leader cDNA was completely digested by S, when it had not been hybridized to the virion RNA (Fig. 2C) . These data indicate that a minimum of 72 bases encode the leader RNA at the S-end of the genome. However, the exact length of the leader RNA is not known.",

The larger leader-containing RNAs, ranging from approximately 130 to 250 nucleotides in length, were more heterogeneous and varied from preparation to preparation. Since similar RNA species were not detected by a cDNA probe (clone 143) which represents the first 800 nucleotides from the 3'-end of the genome (unpublished observation) (Fig. 3C) , these data suggest that they were not derived from degradation of viral RNAs.

MHV-infected cells were disrupted and separated into nuclear, cytosol (S-100) and membrane (P-100) fractions (Stohlman et al., 1983) . RNA from each fraction was separated on polyacrylamide gels and probed for leader-specific RNA sequences (Fig. 4) . All of the leader-containing RNAs were present in both the membrane and cytosol fractions while none were detected in the nuclear fraction. It is noteworthy that the leader RNAs in the range of 70-82 nucleotides were detected in roughly equimolar amounts in the cytosol and membrane fractions while the larger leader-related RNAs (greater than 130 nucleotides) were detected predominantly in the cytosol. This result is consistent with the interpretation that part of the 70-82-nucleotide leader RNA species is coupled to the membrane-associated transcriptional complex and involved in the synthesis of each mRNA. Moreover, although we can not completely rule out the possibility that our fractionation procedures might have disrupted the replication complexes, the detection of a significant portion of these RNA species in cytosol suggests that the leader RNA might also be present in a cytoplasmic pool.",

            "text": "Sequence analysis of mRNAs 7 and 6 suggests that the junction sites between the leader RNA and the body sequences of each mRNA lie between nucleotides 58 and 72 from the 5'-end of the genome (Armstrong et al., 1984; Spaan et al., 1983) . From S, mapping studies, the length of the leader-coding sequences at the 5'-end of the genome is at least 72 nucleotides, but the exact length is not known. The major free leader RNA species identified in the MHV-infected cells is approximately 75 nucleotides in length. However, these data were complicated by the presence of several additional discrete leader-specific RNAs which range between 70 and 82 nucleotides in length. Several explanations could account for the multiple leaderrelated RNAs. Analysis of the primary sequence of the leader RNA suggests that several double-stranded RNA loops, similar to tRNA structure, may be present in the leader RNA (unpublished observation). These loops could represent strong stops for RNA synthesis, causing the accumulation of discrete premature termination products in vivo. Alternatively, the different leader RNAs might be primers for transcription of the different viral mRNAs. It has previously been suggested that differences in the degree of complementarity between the 3'-end of leader RNA and different junction sequences on the (-)-strand could regulate the rate of synthesis of each mRNA species (Fig. 1) (Baric et al., 1983; Spaan et al., 1983) . The requirement for different leader RNAs might also provide an additional mechanism for the regulation of transcription of different mRNA species. The leader-primed transcription model is further supported by our recent finding that the leader sequences could be exchanged at very high frequency between two different MHV strains during mixed infection (Makino et al., unpublished observation) . These data provide strong evidence for a mechanism of MHV transcription involving a free leader RNA. However, definitive proof that these leader RNAs act as primers awaits an in vitro transcription assay. The larger leader-related RNA species which are longer than 130 nucleotides might represent intermediate RNA products caused by premature termination of transcription.",

This possibility has recently been supported by the isolation of recombinant RNA molecules during mixed infection of different MHV strains (unpublished observations). The uncoupling of leader RNA synthesis from mRNA synthesis with ts-LA10 provides strong evidence that transcription of MHV mRNAs requires more than one viral gene function. It is possible that two different polymerases are responsible for the synthesis of the leader RNAs and mRNAs, respectively. Alternatively, a specific viral protein might be required to either bind the leader RNA to the RNA template or modify RNA polymerase to allow the transcription of body sequences of mRNAs.",

However, these leader RNAs are not joined covalently to the mRNAs. While the function of the bunyavirus leader RNAs has not been determined, the 47-nucleotide VSV leader is transported to the nucleus and serves as an inhibitor of host transcription (Grinell and Wagner, 1984; Kurilla et al.. 1982; McGowan et al., 1982) . Similar functions have not been detected with coronavirus leader RNA. On the other hand, the transcription of coronavirus partially resembles that of influenza virus. Although influenza virus does not synthesize a free leader RNA, it requires a host-derived 5'-capped RNA as a primer for transcription (Bouloy et al., 1978; Plotch et al., 1981) . The leader-primed mechanism for RNA transcription employed by coronaviruses might have even more general occurrence. It has been shown that the mRNAs of the variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) in African trypanosomes contain an identical 37-nucleotide stretch at their 5'-ends (Boothroyd and Cross, 1982; Longacre et al., 1983) . More recent studies have shown that a free leader RNA is synthesized which might serve as the primer for the VSG mRNA (Campbell et al., 1984; Milhausen et al., 1984) . Thus, this leader-primed RNA transcription might represent a common alternative mechanism for generating spliced mRNAs in eukaryotic organisms.",
