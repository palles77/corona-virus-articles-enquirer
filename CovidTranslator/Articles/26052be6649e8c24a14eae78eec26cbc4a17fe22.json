A central finding of the Commission is that the HIV epidemic is not on track to end and that existing tools are insufficient. Although antiretroviral therapy (ART) has transformed the HIV response by averting deaths, improving quality of life, and preventing new HIV infections, HIV treatment alone will not end the epidemic. The UNAIDS 909090 approach must be accompanied by a similarly robust commitment to scaledup primary HIV prevention and to the development of a preventive vaccine and a functional cure for HIV. Ironically, the diminishing energy on HIV is occurring at the moment when lessons learned during the HIV response could serve as pathfinders in the quest for sustainable health for all. From its inception, the HIV response was a unique undertaking, apart from the broader health system. Although elements of a diseasespecific approach will and should be retained, the future of the HIV response will also depend on finding opportunities for integrating HIV services more closely within health systems. Wholesale abandonment of vertical HIV funding would involve considerable risks, as the laserlike focus on a single disease accounts in large measure for the HIV response's successes. Unique attributes that have defined the HIV response (including its multisectoral and inclusive approach, engagement of civil society, emphasis on equity and human rights, galvanisation of scientific innovation, and foundation of global collaboration and problem solving) must be preserved and mainstreamed across global health practice.",

In most cases, approaches to integration will and should be incremental, allowing learning by doing. To assess the health and financial benefits of such winwin scenarios, the Commission engaged modellers to examine different scenarios for incremental integration of HIVrelated and nonHIV related services. These include: models in South Africa and Kenya for screening of HIV alongside screening for diabetes, hypertension, and other NCDs; integration of HIV in reproductive health services in Nigeria; integrated management of HIV and sexually transmitted infections in India; and integration of harm reduction and overdose services and ART for people who use drugs in Russia. In each of these scenarios, integrated approaches generated concrete improvements in HIV and broader health outcomes. With one exception (antiretroviral preexposure prophylaxis [PrEP] in India), integrated models were consistently found to be costeffective.",

Unless further investments are made to accelerate expansion of HIV prevention and treatment programmes, the HIV epidemic is likely to rebound and grow far more serious in the coming years, especially as the world's largestever cohort of young people age into adolescence and young adulthood. 6 Notwithstanding the enormous progress that has been made in the HIV response, HIV remains \"the epidemic of our time\". 7 In 2015-16, an estimated 36\u00b77-38\u00b78 million people were living with HIV worldwide, including 1\u00b79-2\u00b75 million newly infected in 2015. 1, 8 More than 35 million people have died of AIDSrelated causes; 1\u00b70 million of these deaths were in 2016. 9 A refusal to follow through to achieve longterm control of the epidemic would merely repeat a longstanding pattern in global health, when failure to sustain a surge in global interest in combating particular health threats allows these epidemics to return in force. The history of malaria elimination efforts is a case in point, as the failure to sustain malariarelated control programmes, funding, and research investments led to an abandonment of the global malaria elimination campaign in 1969 and subsequent increases in the global malaria burden. 10 At a moment when the means to improve human health are greater than ever, allowing a resurgence of HIV through neglect and apathy could deal a blow from which the broader cause of global health could need decades to recover.",

The Commission was tasked with assessing the future of the HIV response in a more integrated global health and development agenda, with the aim of advising how best to achieve global control of the HIV pandemic in an era in which health and development priorities are proliferating. The Commission studied the history of the HIV response to discern how experience in responding to HIV might inform and strengthen global health more broadly. Modelling exercises were undertaken to assess the effect of various approaches to improve integration of HIV and nonHIVrelated services. The most salient threats to global health and to the goal of universal health coverage were identified.",

By taking on board the lessons of the HIV response, the global health field can be made fit for the purpose of realising the vision of sustainable health for all. Global health can serve as a driving force to repudiate and discredit the continuing retreat from international solidarity, human rights, reason, scientific evidence, and open societies. Global health can serve as a pioneer in a reengineering of the development project, from one based on charity from the highincome countries to one that tackles the central determinants of global health inequities.

In diverse countries, lowerincome households consisten tly have poorer access to health care than the more affluent and experience comparatively greater morbidity and mortality. 25 Existing global health mechanisms and practices fail to ensure ready, equitable access to international public goods such as medicines and diagnostics. Although the 2001 Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health recognised the flexibility of countries under international law to obtain access to essential medicines, the global community has yet to find a workable balance between trade and the right to health. Unfortunately, the HIV response, which achieved a 99% reduction in the annual cost of firstline ART between 2000 and 2015, largely remains an outlier with respect to medicines access in resourcelimited settings. Affordable diagnostic tools are also often in short supply. Nearly half of African countries have no cancer radiotherapy services, leaving four of five Africans without access to radiotherapy. 26 The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa underscored the ongoing crisis of global health governance. 27 Although the International Health Regulations were designed in part to discourage restrictive and coercive responses to health emergencies, nearly a quarter of the WHO member states imposed restrictions on trade and travel in response to the Ebola outbreak. 28 WHO, a cornerstone for global health governance, remains chronically underfunded and hobbled by a decentralised structure, which often inhibits rapid and effective responses to emerging health crises. 29 Deteriorating environment for human rights, sound governance, and global cooperation",

Notable reductions in the incidence of new infections and deaths associated with HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria between 2000 and 2015 led the UN to declare that these epidemics had been halted and reversed. 12 Globally, life expectancy increased faster in 2000-15 than in half a century, increasing on average a full 5 years. The greatest increase in life expectancy occurred in Africa, which had previously seen sharp reductions in life expectancy as a result of the HIV epidemic (figure 2). With three of the eight MDGs specifically focused on health, the MDG agenda catalysed a remarkable increase in official development assistance for health.",

Although numerous LMICs have made important strides in expanding health coverage, 36 400 million people do not have access to essential health services, and 6% of people in LMICs are impoverished or pushed deeper into poverty by household medical expenses. 37 More than 15 000 children younger than 5 years die every day, largely from preventable communicable diseases and malnutrition. 38 45% of childhood deaths are associated with undernutrition, 80% are associated with low birthweight, and NCDs are increasing as a major cause of death in children. 39 In 2015, 1\u00b72 million adolescents died, largely from preventable causes. 40 Adolescents are at high risk of sexually transmitted infections (including HIV 41 ), unintended pregnancy, unmet contraceptive need, and contraceptive failure. 42 NCDs (eg, cancers, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes) account for 70% of deaths worldwide, and more than 75% of NCDrelated deaths occur in LMICs. 43 In the future, LMICs will account for up to 80% of the anticipated global increase in cancer cases and deaths. 44 NCDs are projected to exact economic costs of $47 trillion in the next two decades, 45 and progress in combatting NCDs will affect the world's ability to attain at least nine of the 17 SDGs. 46 While the world mobilises to address NCDs as the primary driver of mortality and disability, the global community must follow through on its commitments to make communicable diseases a thing of the past. Tuberculosis, for example, is the leading cause of death by single infectious agents, the ninth leading cause of death overall (accounting for 1\u00b77 million deaths in 2016 38 ), and the leading cause of death in people living with HIV. 47 Africa accounts for roughly 80% of all cases of and death from combined HIV and tuberculosis. Unlike HIV, tuberculosis is a curable infection. Nearly half of the world's population is at risk for malaria, and no meaningful progress in reducing malaria cases and deaths was seen in 2016. 48 Likewise, the challenge of addressing viral hepatitis remains considerable ( figure 3 ). An estimated 71 million people worldwide have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, and 2\u00b77 million of these people have HIV infection. 51 An estimated 1\u00b734 million people die from viral hepatitis each year, and this includes an estimated 399 000 deaths related to HCV infection. 51 Alcohol and drug use disorders are associated with extensive morbidity, disability, and mortality 52 and are also closely linked with HIV transmission through the sharing of syringes and the effects of specific drugs (eg, amphetamines) on condom use and sexual HIV transmission. 53 In 2016, mental health disorders accounted for nearly 16% of years lived with disability worldwide. 52",

Although only 680 000 people were receiving ART in 2000 (most of them in highincome countries), by June 2017, this number had risen to 20\u00b79 million people (18\u00b74 million-21\u00b77 million), or 57% of all people living with HIV worldwide. 57 In 2016, an estimated 1\u00b76 million deaths were averted worldwide as a result of ART. 1 The history of ART and its effect on the global HIV epidemic is one of multidisciplinary collaboration, continual improvements in the quality and durability of treatment regimens, everincreasing aspirations for service coverage, and passionate advocacy to overcome the resistance that HIV treatment expansion elicited. Public and private sector researchers combined to generate the therapies capable of halting viral replication; civil society advocacy and competition from and within the generic pharmaceutical industry coalesced to produce marked reductions in the prices of ART; robust funding, primarily at the outset from international donors, enabled rapid introduction and expansion of treatment programmes; and programme planners and implementers (as well as affected communities) have helped to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of HIV treatment service delivery. As the scientific evidence expanded, normative guidance on HIV treatment evolved, and in 2015, WHO recom mended the initiation of ART for all people living with HIV, irrespective of disease stage, both for clinical benefit to the individual living with HIV and for the prevention benefits of successful viral suppression on onward transmission. 58 Substantial scientific advances have also been achieved in primary HIV prevention. Principally due to implementation of ART for pregnant women and other measures to prevent vertical HIV transmission, the number of children newly infected with HIV decreased from 470 000 children in 2002, to 160 000 children in 2016. 1 Since results of clinical trials more than a decade ago showed that medical male circumcision reduces the risk of femaletomale sexual HIV transmission by about 60%, 59 nearly 15 million men in subSaharan Africa have been circumcised. 60 PrEP has substantial HIV prevention efficacy, 61 and cash transfers might reduce young people's HIV risk behaviours or the odds of acquiring HIV, or both. 62",

            "text": "As part of the SDGs, UN member states have pledged to end the AIDS epidemic as a public health threat by 2030, which has been defined as reducing the number of new HIV infections and AIDSrelated deaths by 90% relative to 2010. The cornerstone of this global undertaking is the UNAIDS 909090 approach, which follows that by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV will know their HIV status, 90% of people with an HIV diagnosis will receive ART, and 90% of people receiving ART will achieve viral suppression. 65 The 909090 approach is grounded in the considerable evidence that ART sharply reduces the risk of HIV transmission. 66 Within the FastTrack strategy proposed by UNAIDS to reduce the incidence of new HIV infections to less than 200 000 annually by 2030, UNAIDS estimates that scaledup ART will account for 60% of HIV infections averted during this period. 64 However, it is increasingly clear that the 909090 approach on its own will be inadequate to end the epidemic. Even as ART coverage has steadily increased and as the HIV response has adopted an almost singular focus on HIV treatment expansion, the rate at which the incidence of new HIV infections is decreasing remains far too slow to achieve epidemic control. A case in point is Botswana, which might already have achieved the 909090 target, 67 but the decrease in new HIV infections is far too modest to end the country's epidemic. 1 Outcomes across the HIV treatment continuum in eastern and southern Africa, Latin America, and high income countries are cause for optimism that the 909090 target might be achieved by 2020 in these settings ( figure 4 ). However, in other regions, the proportion of people living with HIV who had suppressed virus in 2016 was far off the pace for the 73% target viral suppression benchmark for 2020 under the 909090 approach (viral suppression was achieved for 34% of people with HIV in the Caribbean, 25% in west and central Africa, 22% in eastern Europe and central Asia, and 16% in the Middle East and north Africa). 1 Ensuring widespread viral suppression is also a challenge in many highincome countries such as the USA, where only 49% of people with HIV were virally suppressed in 2014. 68 The prevention benefits of expanded ART would be substantially enhanced by a similarly vigorous scaleup of other strategic prevention interventions. In Uganda, the combination of steady expansion in ART coverage, a neardoubling of the rate with which HIV viral suppression is achieved, and rollout of medical male circumcision was associated with a 42% reduction in HIV incidence in 10 years. 69 In cities in highincome countries, the prioritised rollout of PrEP as a complement to the testandtreat approach has con tributed to sharp decreases in the incidence of new HIV infections, especially in gay and bisexual men. 70, 71 Although the socalled combination prevention approach has long been recommended as the optimal means to reduce the risk of new HIV infections, the approach has seldom been implemented at scale because national HIV responses have increasingly come to be dominated by an overwhelming emphasis on HIV treatment. Less than one in five people at risk of HIV acquisition have access to prevention programmes because of chronic underfunding of HIV prevention. 6 An alternative future for the HIV epidemic: persistent settings and communities with heavy HIV burdens Far from putting the world on course to vanquish AIDS, existing approaches are leaving numerous populations behind. In subSaharan Africa, young people and men of all ages consistently have suboptimal outcomes along the HIV treatment continuum. 5 Various marginalised populations at increased risk of HIV infection, including gay and bisexual men, people who inject drugs, sex workers, transgender people, and the sex partners of people in these groups, accounted for 44% of new HIV infections worldwide (80% of new infections outside subSaharan Africa). 5 Contrary to optimistic expectations of ending AIDS, these trends point toward the likelihood of a much more concerning scenario. Athough the desired benefits of populationlevel viral suppression could be realised in settings and populations where access to HIV testing and treatment services is widespread, those people living in countries or belonging to marginalised populations in which services are difficult or impossible to obtain will remain highly vulnerable to HIV acquisition.",

For example, even as the incidence of HIV infections in the USA have decreased overall since 2008, 72 black gay and bisexual men now have a 50% lifetime chance of acquiring HIV (figure 5). 73 Rates of viral suppression in people living with HIV in the USA have steadily improved, 74 but black gay and bisexual men living with HIV are markedly less likely than other people living with HIV to receive ART, remain engaged in care, and achieve viral suppression. 75 Major pockets of endemic HIV are also apparent in Russia, where HIV infections are heavily concentrated in six subnational regions (referred to as Federal Subjects) in eastern and western Siberia, along principal overland heroin and opium trafficking routes out of Afghanistan. In the case of people who inject drugs, in Russia and elsewhere, access to prevention and treatment services is extremely limited. 76 A similar clustering of susceptibility to HIV is apparent in the KwaZuluNatal province of South Africa, where adolescent girls and women younger than 25 years are roughly three times more likely than men younger than 25 years to be living with HIV. 77 The persistence of large, highprevalence, and high incidence areas in the midst of epidemics that are large and small, decreasing and increasing, is a global phenomenon. Compared with the population as a whole, gay men and other men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs, sex workers, and transgender women are 19 times, 78 13\u00b75 times, 79 22 times, 80 and 49 times, 81 more likely to be living with HIV, respectively. Yet although these marginalised populations have a disproportionate and growing HIV burden, they are often the groups least likely to obtain access to HIV prevention, treatment, and care services. 78 With the failure of existing service approaches to address persistent susceptibility or to reach those people who are in greatest need, it is clear that new and scaled up service delivery and community engagement stra tegies will be needed. The transmissionpreventing potential of scaledup ART must be matched with an equally strong reduction in the risk of HIV acquisition and transmission. 7, 82 And programmes for the delivery of prevention and treatment services must be coupled with renewed efforts to address the social and structural factors that increase risk and susceptibility and diminish utilisation of essential services.",

In the epidemic's early years, gay communities in several countries mobilised to resist the imposition of coercive measures in what was then a new and frightening epidemic. Across the world, chapters of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT UP) marched in the streets and infiltrated decision making bodies to demand greater investments in HIV research and expedited, peoplecentred approaches to the evaluation and approval of new medicines. In South Africa, activism by Treatment Action Campaign and other groups led to dramatic changes in national HIV policies, which have reverberated around the world. In every region, activists have emerged to challenge high prices for HIV treatments and to insist on approaches to intellectual property that take into account the needs of people with lifethreatening diseases.",

However, as the incidence of HIV infections and AIDSrelated mortality have decreased, and as funding for civil society activities has diminished, so have the magnitude and intensity of AIDS activism. In particular, the kind of cohesive activist voice that united the global north and south and laid the foundation for the HIV treatment revolution is no longer evident.

Rather than look to oftenoverburdened health systems to manage HIV as one of many health problems, specific vertical funding mechanisms and frequently diseasespecific service delivery channels were established to respond to the global emergency. In 2000-01, diverse global stakeholders spearheaded the creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which, by the end of 2016, had allocated more than $17 billion for HIV programmes in more than 100 countries, while also providing much needed support to chronically neglected tuberculosis and malaria. 83 Created in 2003, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) is the largest bilateral health programme ever devoted to a single disease. The UN also took a distinctly unorthodox approach to HIV, vesting UN leadership on the epidemic, not with the designated health agency WHO, but in the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), a multidisciplinary and cosponsored programme. 84 Whether such an exceptionalist approach will remain feasible is unclear. Overall investments in the HIV response, taking into account both domestic and inter national sources, has remained relatively flat in recent years, at about $19\u00b71 billion, roughly $7 billion short of the amounts needed to achieve 909090 and the broader UNAIDS FastTrack strategy. 5 In 2016, total resources for HIV programmes actually decreased by 7%. 85 In the midst of growing insecurity and disorder in the regions that have historically led in mobilising international financing for the HIV response (namely, North America and Europe), HIV seems less frightening than in earlier times. African leadership in the HIV response, so crucial to success under the MDGs, is also less visible. In a globalised world where attention spans are limited, the temptation to pretend that HIV is a problem that has been solved has proven to be powerful.",

Experience in integrating HIV in broader health systems underscores both the benefits and potential risks associated with a more integrated and less exceptionalist approach to HIV, illustrates the challenges confronting greater linkage and integration, and highlights potentially valuable opportunities to rethink further how the HIV response fits within the broader global health enterprise. This experience further shows that the options for future programmatic approaches to HIV are not confined to a binary choice between exceptionalism or wholesale integration, but rather that several opportunities exist in the immediate term for more incremental integration and for learning by doing. In all cases, steps toward integration should be undertaken thoughtfully, retaining the key principles that have defined the HIV response.",

Childhood vaccination programmes, including pro grammes sup ported by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, have generated exceptionally high and increasing rates of immunisation. 39 Between 2000 and 2014, measles vaccination is estimated to have saved 17\u00b71 million lives. 86 Between 2010 to 2015, the mortality from malaria in children younger than 5 years decreased by 35% 87 because of dramatic increases in the coverage of key malaria interventions. 39 The HIV response illustrates both the potential of focused global action to improve the health of children as well as the persistent failures of health systems to address children's needs. As the proportion of pregnant women living with HIV who receive antiretroviral medicines has increased, the incidence of new HIV infections in children has sharply decreased. In 2016, the 160 000 new HIV infections in children represented a 47% decrease since 2010, and a 66% decrease since 2005. 1 By contrast, little progress has been made with respect to integrated interventions that rely on regular contacts with the health system. Comparing utilisation data for 2000-08 with that of 2009-14, met demand for family planning services increased only modestly, from 54% to 64%, the proportion of pregnant women who visited antenatal care at least four times increased only from 50% to 56%, the share of births with a skilled attendant increased only incrementally, from 55% to 65%, and similarly modest increases (less than 10%) were reported for exclusive breastfeeding, oral rehydration therapy, and careseeking for pneumonia. 39 Shortcomings in health systems that undermine health outcomes for children include weak laboratory systems, inadequate systems for monitoring mother-child pairs from antenatal to paediatric care settings, fragmented service delivery systems that invite discontinuity of care, and frequent drug stockouts.",

            "text": "The HIV response has galvanised interdisciplinary work to clarify young people's reasons for engaging in unprotected sex and effective means to reduce sexual risks. Data from extensive research have conclusively shown that abstinence is a failed strategy for HIV prevention. 96 Effective prevention of HIV and sexually transmitted infections and advancement of broader sexual and reproductive health in young people necessitates evidencebased, tailored, flexible, and client centred approaches to sexual harm reduction and comprehensive sexual education (figure 8). 97 Ready access to contraception and other family planning services is essential because half of pregnancies in girls aged 15-19 years are unintended. 98 Changing lifestyles mean that an increasing number of adolescents are susceptible to the health risks associated with poor diet, tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse, malnutrition (including anaemia and obesity), and NCDs such as diabetes and cancer. In turn, these risks are associated with preventable mortality in adulthood. Mental health issues are among the top five causes of adolescent disabilityadjusted lifeyears (DALYs) lost, with more than 75% of mental illnesses originating before age 24 years. 99 All adolescents have the right to accessible health services. Helping youth to prioritise health and engage in services is challenging when low mortality and good health is expected in young people, prior experience in healthcare interaction is limited, and concern about confidentiality breaches is high. 99 Among the key lessons learned in the HIV response is that health services must be tailored to young people's needs and preferences and should offer an integrated combination of services. Integrated service packages must include comprehensive health checks relevant to adolescents and take into consideration other priorities such as education and economic opportunities, which, if unaddressed, lead to poor health and wellbeing. 89 Achieving universal health coverage demands the availability of adolescentfocused health services in all health facilities and in other more accessible multi purpose spaces. Adolescentfriendly services offer operating hours outside of work or school, create a friendly and non judgmental environment, engage peers in support functions, promote health in ways that appeal to young people, and use modern technologies and innovations already incorporated in the daily lives of adolescents. 100, 101 Meeting the needs of women Women's health needs often differ from those of men. Whereas breast cancer is not a leading cause of death in men, the breast is the most common site of cancer diagnosis in women (accounting for 25% of all cases in 2012). 44 Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cancer diagnosis in women and the fourth leading cancer related cause of death in women. 44 Although maternal mortality has decreased, an estimated 830 women die daily from preventable causes associated with pregnancy and childbirth. 102 In addition to heightened physiological vulnerabilities to many diseases and health conditions, women's health risks are often closely linked with their unequal status in societies. For example, an estimated one in three women worldwide will experience physical or sexual violence, and those women who do are roughly twice more likely to experience depression or have an alcohol use disorder and 16% more likely to have a baby with low birthweight than those women who do not. 103 Because of both increased physiological susceptibility to HIV acquisition during penile-vaginal intercourse and because of genderrelated challenges in negotiating safer sex, women are especially susceptible to HIV, accounting for 56% of all people living with HIV in subSaharan Africa. 1 Women's experience of intimate partner violence has been correlated with a 50% increase in the risk of HIV acquisition, 104 and emotional abuse by partners is linked with rapid progression of HIV disease in women. 105 The HIV response has long joined forces with the broader women's health agenda through political advocacy for gender equality, programmes to promote healthy gender norms, and strategies to prevent gender based violence. At national, regional, and global levels, women living with HIV have organised networks to provide mutual support and to increase recognition of HIV as a women's health issue. Substantial resources have been invested in condom programming and other interventions to reduce women's sexual risks and in research to develop prevention methods that women can control on their own.",

Among people living with HIV, women are more likely than men to know their HIV status, receive ART, and achieve viral suppression. 5 The proportion of pregnant women living with HIV who receive effective antiretroviral medicines increased from 47% in 2010, to 76% in 2016. 5 There is growing recognition that the women's health agenda must move beyond its traditional focus on sexual and reproductive health and tackle women's growing burden of NCDs. 105 The Pink Ribbon Red Ribbon partnership, working in six countries in subSaharan Africa and Latin America, aims to leverage momentum and infrastructure from the HIV response to reduce the cancer burden in women. Through the third quarter of 2017, the partnership reported that it had screened more than 465 000 women for cervical cancer and more than 34 000 women for breast cancer, administered the vaccine for human papillomavirus to nearly 148 000 girls, and provided treatment services to almost 30 000 women diagnosed with cervical cancer. 106 ",

            "text": "Health outcomes are consistently worse in men than in women. In 2015, mean life expectancy was 5\u00b78 years higher in women than in men (74\u00b78 years [uncertainty interval 74\u00b74-75\u00b72] for women vs 69\u00b70 [68\u00b76-69\u00b74] for men), and this gender gap in life expectancy is increasing over time. 107 These patterns are vividly reflected in HIV related outcomes; in 2016, men accounted for less than half of all adults (>15 years) living with HIV but for an estimated 58\u00b74% of AIDSrelated deaths. 1 A key driver in gender differences in health outcomes appears to be men's comparatively lower utilisation of health services. In a national survey in 2013, 108 men in the USA were markedly less likely than women (72% vs 86%) to report a regular source of care or to report having seen a healthcare provider in the previous 2 years (75% vs 91%). Across regions, men are consistently less likely than women to know their HIV status, to receive ART, and to remain engaged in care once they initiate HIV treatment. 5 In many countries, especially in LMICs, the best developed healthservice delivery platforms (eg, antenatal, maternal, paediatric, sexual and reproductive services) are often designed primarily for use by women or children, or both. In many settings, few, if any, healthservice delivery channels have been developed specifically with men in mind. This has led to the common belief that clinics are not meant for men, 109 deterring men from accessing health services. Often, health services are accessible only during working hours, further discouraging male workforce participants from obtaining the services they need. Popular notions of masculinity might also disfavour receipt of health services as a sign of weakness. 110 In view of the severe gender gap in health, it is striking how little attention the HIV response or the global health field has given to men's health issues. To close the gender gap, decision makers must expressly value men's lives and prioritise action to increase men's access to and use of health services. In the case of HIV, a growing body of evidence suggests that communitycentred programmes that specifically work to engage men and address their needs and preferences (including flexible clinic hours, mobile services, workplace programmes, and private access) can effectively diminish the gender gap in men's utilisation of health services. 111 To reach nearly 15 million men with voluntary medical male circumcision in 14 African countries in 2008-16, and thereby avert more than 500 000 new HIV infections through 2030, 60 circumcision programmes worked with men and local communities to forge new social norms, offered services at hours that corresponded to men's needs, used a variety of service delivery approaches (eg, mobile outreach), and integrated circumcision services with multiple other health services. 112 Innovative service models could diminish or eliminate gender gaps in HIV service utilisation ( figure 9 ). SEARCH, a communitycentred research project in 32 rural communities in Kenya and Uganda, integrated HIV testing in multidisease health fairs and used innovative approaches to deliver ART through colocated services. To help avoid a gender gap in testing utilisation, SEARCH created menonly discussion groups that invited men to discuss HIV and sexual health issues. After 2 years of the intervention, gender gaps across the 909090 cascade had effectively disappeared, with men achieving the first two 90s and 88% viral suppression. 113 ",

A further irony is that these failed policies also spawned one of the most successful of all HIV prevention strategies. Harm reduction is a practical and rightsbased approach that aims to mitigate the negative consequences of behaviours, including when cessation of the behaviour is infeasible or not desired by the individual. This approach has potential applicability to a host of health problems beyond bloodborne pathogens such as reducing alcoholrelated problems, minimising road trauma, and preventing skin cancers.

Harmreduction services have the added public health benefit of facilitating linkages to other HIV related services, drug treatment, and primary health care. Harm reduction is increasingly being adopted in diverse settings, although large gaps in the scale and coverage of harmreduction programmes limit the ability of many countries to halt HIV and HCV epidemics. 115 The USA, long a leading proponent of the global war on drugs, appears poised to undertake a rapid expansion of MAT in response to a surge in opioid addiction, offering poten tial opportunities to alter the global discourse on harm reduction.",

Reductions in the prison population might free up resources for scaling up ART, drug treatment, and primary health care in prison settings and reduce the incidence and risk of infectious diseases. In pursuing locally tailored drug policy reform, nation states and states within nation states can help build a compelling evidence base that can guide and inform reform efforts, unlock new efficiencies in prison systems, and build new constituencies for drug policy reform. To transcend polarising political debates that have limited its support, harm reduction itself needs to expand and mainstream its ethos and more integrate its application beyond drug use across a wider spectrum of stakeholders and public health issues.",

In 2017, more than 70 countries criminalised consensual samesex relations, 119 and the legal and policy barriers confronted by gay men have only increased in recent years, including through enactment of Russia's socalled gay propaganda law and a draconian antigay law in Nigeria that went into effect in 2014. The past 2 years witnessed a sharp increase in the number of arrests of gay men in Indonesia 120 and the forced closure of dropin clinics providing HIV and other health and social services to gay men in Tanzania. 121 Such a climate of fear and hostility inevitably increases gay men's susceptibility to HIV and reduces their access to essential prevention and treatment services. In India and in Moscow, only a small minority of gay men living with HIV have achieved viral suppression, with lack of knowledge of HIV status serving as the most serious service bottleneck. 122, 123 Coverage of PrEP, a potentially transformative prevention tool for gay man and other marginalised populations, is only minimal outside of highincome countries. 5 A crucial barrier to a more effective HIV response for gay men (and an unfortunate reflection of the neglect of gay men's needs) is the shortage of robust evidence for action in this population. Although findings from focused studies continue to demonstrate extraordinarily high HIV prevalence and incidence in gay men in broadly diverse settings, evidence on gay men from standard surveillance systems is extremely limited, primarily because these systems focus on adults of reproductive age, especially in highburden settings. Many countries still have no estimates of the size of the gay population, and half of those countries with estimations employ methodologies that call the reliability of these estimates into question. 124 ",

In part through regional cooperative compacts, more countries are taking steps to introduce health insurance approaches that explicitly cover migrants, yet implementation of these approaches remains incomplete 129 and many migrant workers in such settings are unaware of the health benefits to which they are ostensibly entitled. 130 The stigmatisation and scapegoating of immigrants, including the risk of death or injury from increasingly coercive border control practices and acts of anti immigrant violence, contribute immeasurably to their susceptibility. Migration could lead to discontinuity and fragmentation of health care, a particularly serious problem for people with chronic diseases. Health risks are compounded when migration is the forced result of military conflict or humanitarian emergency, which can create especially chaotic conditions and prove particularly disruptive to service systems. In 2018, results of a phylogenetic analysis in Ukraine suggested that migration resulting from civil conflict in eastern Ukraine led to a rapid redistribution of HIV infection westward and an apparent increase in HIV drug resistance. 131 In an increasingly mobile world, steps to address the health needs of people on the move are crucial to the future of global health. In the push to achieve universal health coverage, countries need to take on board lessons learned from Thailand's pioneering provision of comprehensive health coverage for migrants living within its borders. 132 In regions with extensive cross border migration, innovative regional efforts will be needed to ensure continuity of care. Migrants should have access to health navigators and other health services in their own language. In close collaboration with other civil society partners, health advocates should energetically oppose demagogic efforts to stigmatise migrant communities.",

Due to the effectiveness of ART, the HIV population is steadily ageing over time, with the number of people older than 50 years who are living with HIV increasing by 36% between 2012 and 2016. 1 In 2016, subSaharan Africa was home to 3\u00b77 million people (65 %) of the world's people living with HIV who are older than 50 years. 1 As people live longer with HIV and depend on ART for decades, the care of people living with HIV will increasingly focus on prevention and management of NCDs. People living with HIV have an increased risk of many ageassociated diseases, 133 including cardiovascular diseases, 134 neurocognitive disorders, 135 endstage renal disease, and nonAIDSdefining cancers. 136 NCD risks appear to be less pronounced for people who initiate HIV treatment at higher CD4 counts and, presumably, for those using modern ART regimens with fewer known negative sideeffects. 137 As diverse stakeholders coalesce to create a global movement to address NCDs, experiences in the HIV response (including its advocacy successes, community engagement, models of care, and innovation to ensure access to essential diagnostics and medicines) potentially hold important lessons for the NCD community. 138 Already, the global attention to NCDs has surged, as reflected in the creation of the NCD Alliance and the Lancet NCD Action Group, the upcoming Third High Level Meeting on NCDs at the UN's General Assembly in 2018, the WHOcommissioned Independent High Commission on NCDs, and grassroots movements to increase cancer awareness and funding for cancer research. However, much greater political commitment, and the willingness to stand up to entrenched financial interests such as the tobacco and food industries, 139 will be needed if NCDs are to receive the attention they warrant. 140 The NCD agenda has a clear potential to catalyse action to address the structural determinants of health. Structural approaches (ensuring smokefree environ ments, banning or restricting advertising for tobacco or alcohol products, using taxes to discourage use of tobacco or alcohol, reducing salt and sugar content in packaged foods and beverages, and replacing transfats with healthier alternatives) are pivotal to efforts to reduce NCDs. 141 Given the powerful degree to which socio economic status influences susceptibility to NCDs, 142 strategies to alleviate poverty also support prevention of NCDs. As structural action to address NCDs requires action in multiple domains (eg, social protection, trade, agriculture, taxation and finance, agriculture, manu facturing, labour), it is important that health routinely be taken into account in policy development processes. Toward the goals of more integrated and universally accessible health systems and sustainable health for all, policy development should prioritise structural approaches that generate health benefits for diverse populations and health conditions. As prevention of NCDs involve substantial shifts in social norms and practices (eg, smoking and alcohol consumption, diet, indoor cooking practices), engagement of communities is essential.",

Until recently, the global health discourse on NCDs focused almost exclusively on prevention, implicitly assuming that treatments would remain out of reach for the foreseeable future. The growing global movement on NCDs, as in the HIV response that preceded it, is rightly insisting on urgent action to make NTD treatments affordable and widely available. 143 Although the HIV response is justifiably proud of having created service systems capable of delivering ART to millions of people, the healthsystems challenges associated with NCDs are even greater than they were for HIV. Effectively addressing NCDs will require reconfiguration of health programmes and individual clinics and will demand new investments in health workforce training and development 144 to increase expertise in management of cardiovascular disease, oncology, geriatric medicine, radiotherapy, and other NCDrelated disciplines. Comprehensive and integrated care needs to be established as the working norm for health systems, with primary care as the cornerstone. Models of communitybased and communitydelivered care, which prioritise selfcare and differentiated services for people living with HIV, have potentially broad applicability to the management of NCDs. 145 Capacitating health systems to address multiple health problems in an integrated manner, including through colocated services, will improve efficiencies and aid in destigmatising both HIV and NCDs.",

Consequently, other elements of SRHR (eg, abortion, contraception, and comprehensive sexuality education for youth) became easy targets for political agendas already seeking to eliminate access to such services. Moreover, this separation has undermined efforts to firmly establish HIV and SRH service delivery in a human rights framework, prioritising bodily autonomy, sexual rights, and access to information and services, 150 which has been a contributing factor to violations of sexual and reproductive rights of women living with HIV, such as the use of forced or coerced sterilisation or abortion. 151 Although notable, if uneven, progress has been made in integrating services for the prevention of motherto child HIV transmission in broader SRHR approaches, 152 progress in addressing the SRHR needs of women, girls, and sexual minorities remains wholly inadequate. Even in highburden settings in subSaharan Africa, where a substantial number of women need services to prevent both unintended pregnancy and HIV, integrated services are rare. 153 Marginalised populations at increased risk of HIV infection (including sexual minorities) have additional SRHR needs that are often unaddressed by SRHR services that primarily cater to married or coupled women of reproductive age. 153 ",

Observational data suggest a potential association between use of the progestinonly injectable contraceptive depot medroxy progesterone acetate (DMPA) and risk of HIV acquisition in women exposed to the virus. 155 In updated guidelines, WHO in February, 2017, recommended that women considering use of progestinonly injectables be advised about these concerns, the uncertainty over whether the association is causal, and how to minimise their risk of acquiring HIV. 156 Services for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of sexually transmitted infections offer an important plat form for integrating HIV in broader SRHR services. Fully capturing the potential synergies and comple mentarities between sexually transmitted infections and HIV prevention will necessitate a more holistic and contextspecific approach to sexual health. As an example of HIV-STI integration, the Dean Street Express clinic in London, UK, provides a comfortable dropin facility where individuals input sexual risk information in kiosks, privately selfcollect their oral, rectal, and genital specimens for detection of sexually transmitted infection, have specimens delivered via pneumatic tube to an onsite laboratory, and receive their results via text messaging within several hours. Another approach to enhance sexual health is the New York City PlaySure sexual health programme, which educates atrisk persons that HIV medications used for treatment, PrEP, or postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) can protect the health of individuals irrespective of serostatus. Paired with an integrated package of sexual health services that include routine sexual health screenings and rapid initiation of antiretroviral medications for either prevention or treatment, New York's Status Neutral model uses sexual health services as a gateway to transition from safety net services to more longitudinal and comprehensive care.",

With increasing popu lation pressure, urbanisation, travel and displace ment, climate change, habitat destruction, and global antimicrobial use, the world will inevitably see more frequent health emergencies related to infectious dis eases. 157 Some of these emergencies are highly likely, such as pandemic influenza, which will always reappear. 158 Others emergencies such as Middle East respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome might be entirely new infections that will require rapid collect ion of data to understand the natural history. New presentations could be of known infections but in nonimmune communities, as recently seen with the Zika virus outbreak, or the emergence of drugresistant strains of known pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and HIV. 159 Many diseasecontrol interventions are relevant irrespective of the particular health challenge, including communitybased care delivery, the requirement for and training of a diverse health workforce able to handle infectious diseases, control of nosocomial spread, research methodology, and infrastructure for effective community engagement ( figure 11 ). All infectious disease emergencies require strong laboratory and surveillance systems to detect and understand the rapidly changing epidemiology and drive an evidenceinformed and countryspecific response. The HIV response has been an example of community engagement and empowerment that has led to accelerated research and more effective programme implementation in many parts of the world. The strengths of the HIV response can therefore inform responses to global health emergencies.",

Health workforce shortages undermine effective management and control of HIVtuberculosis coinfection, and health workers addressing HIV-tuberculosis coinfection are also at substantial risk of occupational exposure to tuberculosis. As HIV and tuberculosis programmes were developed separately, with different funding streams and constituencies, ensuring ongoing communication and collaboration between these programmes might be hindered by resistance from turfconscious programme implement ers and planners. Tuberculosis and HIV-tuberculosis coinfection are particularly challenging issues for incarcerated persons worldwide. 163 According to a review of HIV, viral hepatitis, and tuberculosis burden in prisoners and detainees, the most effective way to reduce these infections in prisoners and in the broader communities from which they come is to reduce mass incarceration for people who inject drugs. 163 Numerous efforts worldwide, often extremely suc cessful, have been made to improve HIV-tuberculosis collaboration and linkages. In Khayelitsha, South Africa, HIV and tuberculosis programmes were physically merged in 2003 to enable socalled onestop shopping for people with HIV-tuberculosis coinfection. 164 In Tanzania, PASADA, a faithbased organisation providing comprehensive HIV care, collaborated with national tuberculosis authorities to integrate tuberculosis services and improve laboratory capacity, harmonise staff train ing and reporting, dedicate a room within the clinic for patients with tuberculosis, and link services with a strong social support system.

Hepatitis B virus was isolated much earlier than Hepatitis C virus, and global coverage of the vaccine, which is cheap and effective, for newborn babies reached 84% in 2016. 166 The HIV epidemic, including the desperation for effective therapies it elicited in its early years and the changes it wrought to drug development, regulatory policies, and the global infrastructure for clinical trial enrolment, laid the foundation for the development of the highly effective, safe, alloral, curative therapies that have emerged for HCV infection. As in the case of HIV, originator companies have entered voluntary license agreements with generic manufacturers to produce and distribute directacting antivirals, which has substantially lowered treatment costs in the LMICs covered by these agreements. Due to differences in epidemiological burden between HIV and HCV, with substantial concentration of HCV infection in many uppermiddle income countries and highincome countries that are excluded from voluntary licenses for directacting antivirals, costs of these drugs remain prohibitive in many parts of the world. 167 Community mobilisation has had an essential role for responses to both HIV and HCV.

These services for drug addiction are fully compatible with HIV prevention and treatment services, including HIV testing and provision of ART, PrEP, syringes, condoms, and overdose prevention (eg, naloxone). A team in northeast USA developed culturally tailored programmes that use innovative means to provide MAT, work with correctional systems, and understand the interplay between substance use, violence and victimisation, sex work, and behavioural health morbidities. 178 This approach was subsequent ly adapted to other settings, including Ukraine and Malaysia.",

People with substance use disorders are often excluded from MAT or other services if they have a comorbid psychiatric disorder (and vice versa), an approach that not only worsens health outcomes but also compounds the marginalisation experienced by people with these disorders. In many settings, treatment for substance use and HIV operate in silos, resulting in fragmented care and suboptimal clinical outcomes. Meaningful integration of services for people with substance use and HIV requires a health workforce that is culturally competent and professionally skilled to create clinical environments that promote service access, engagement, retention, and medical adherence.

            "text": "There are multiple reasons for the frequent cooccurrence of mental health disorders and HIV, with many stemming from the internalised stigma and stress that are often associated with behaviours that can result in HIV transmission (eg, sex between men, gender variance, or injecting drug use). 179 Internalised stigma associated with HIV is common not only in marginalised populations but also in settings with highburden epidemics in heterosexual people, linked in many cases to shunning or shaming by families, friends, and social arbiters, including faith leaders. In one recent US cohort, more than one in five patients had clinically significant depression, 22% of the cohort had an anxiety disorder, and a comparable proportion of the cohort had a clinically significant substance use disorder. 180 The linkages and overlaps between HIV and mental health are multifaceted. Depression, especially when it occurs alongside substance use and other health and social conditions, can contribute to risky sexual behaviours. 181 Untreated depression is also correlated with reduced capacity for selfcare and retention in HIV care. 182 These associations are hardly unique to HIV as untreated depression and other psychiatric disorders are strongly linked with nonadherence in patients with cardiovascular and other NCDs. 183 One of the most striking features of the intersection between HIV and mental health is the common cooccurrence of multiple coexisting psychosocial and clinical challenges in people with or at risk of HIV. 184 The presence of these syndemic conditions potentiates sexual transmission risk 182 and nonadherence to antiretroviral medication regimens. 172 Because of the centrality of mental health to the management of a broad array of health conditions, mental health services should be fully integrated into the health system and ideally colocated with other related health services such as treatment and care for HIV, NCDs, and substance use disorders. 185 However, as confirmed by findings from a situation analysis in five LMICs, most health systems are not prepared to provide an integrated and scaledup access to mental health services. 186 Although mental health disorders are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide 52 and one in four people will need mental health services at some point in their lives, many countries invest as little as 2% of total health spending on mental health services. 187 Immediate efforts are needed to implement the actions outlined in WHO's mental health action plan 2013-20. 188 Implementation of these action steps will require major new investments in mental health training for health personnel and a decentralisation of mental health services to increase access to communitybased services. 189",

In addition to essential new investments in traditional medical education, the shifting or sharing of clinical tasks from highercadre to lowercost health workers will be needed to improve healthservice efficiency and expand the reach of health services, especially for remote and marginalised communities. Increased use of trained community health workers offers an important taskshifting strategy for rationalising health spending and bringing services closer to the communities that need them. Compensation and training costs for community health workers are much less than for highercadre health workers, and the availability of community health workers enables doctors and nurses to focus more time on the skills for which they are specially trained. 192 Numerous models for community health workers are already in operation in diverse regions, including in highincome countries. Ideally, community health workers are drawn from the communities they serve, receive extensive training that enables them to diagnose and address multiple health conditions, and are compensated, supervised, and fully integrated into health systems. Integrating community health workers into health systems has been shown to increase immunisation rates, enhance access to diverse health services, and reduce childhood mortality. [193] [194] [195] The financing of health care can have a major effect on the efficiency of health services. To improve efficiency and quality of care, policy makers are advised to optimise the mix of payment strategies (eg, capitation, casebased reimbursement, feeforservice, per diem) that incentivises service access, quality of care, satisfaction of provider and client, and other system priorities. 196 Evidence suggests that carefully designed financial incentives to patients could increase use of preventive care, which improves health outcomes and potentially averts more costly therapeutic interventions in the future.",

Global Fund grants have underwritten a variety of activities to buttress procurement and supply management, including expanded warehousing capacity in Tanzania, digitising and streamlining supply logistics in Laos, and revising and updating of the essential medicines list in Cambodia (Shakarishvili G, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, personal communication). Despite these strategic investments, stockouts of antiretroviral medicines remain a persistent problem in subSaharan Africa, 198 especially with respect to new regimens. 199 Weaknesses in procurement and supply management are not confined to Africa or to HIV medicines but instead represent a systemic challenge that demands highlevel and sustained attention. For example, in the Mekong region, where a rapid surge in malaria resistance has caused global alarm, fake or substandard antimalaria medicines are common. 200 Maintaining separate diseasespecific systems for procurement and supply chain management wastes money, reduces incentives for service integration within health systems and facilities, and siphons scarce funding away from needed systemic investments.",

Movements to integrate HIV into health systems will and should be incremental at the outset, with integrated approaches tailored to national conditions.

Platforms that integrate screening for these three diseases have the potential to address the urgent need for improved diagnosis of diabetes and hypertension. Several mobile multidisease screening interventions have been piloted in South Africa 207 ( figure 15 ) and other African countries. 208, 209 To assess the potential effect and cost of introducing a mobile screening service for diabetes, hypertension, and HIV in South Africa, we extended an HIV model that was previously developed for South Africa, to incorporate diabetes and hyper tension screening (panel 3). The model estimates that if such a multidisease screening programme were introduced in 2018-28, and reached 10% of South African adults each year, the programme would diagnose 492 000 new HIV cases, 1\u00b721 million new diabetes cases, and 6\u00b735 million new hypertension cases.

The total number of new treated HIV, diabetes, and hypertension cases would be expected to increase by 197 000, 543 000, and 2\u00b71 million, respectively.

Unlike South Africa and Kenya, where more than 95% and 80% of eligible women receive prevention of mothertochild transmission (PMTCT) services, respectively, 1 PMTCT coverage in Nigeria has stagnated at 30%, resulting in an estimated 75 000 new infant HIV infections per year. 219 Similarly, only 15% of Nigerian women aged 15-49 years use contraception for limiting and spacing of births. On average, a Nigerian woman gives birth to 6\u00b75 children in her lifetime. As 16% of currently married women have an unmet need for family planning services, linking all married women who wish to space or limit their children to contraceptives would increase the prevalence of contraceptive use to 31%. 220 The modelling scenario for integration of HIV and reproductive health services in Nigeria is shown in panel 5. In the absence of additional intervention, the baseline model estimates a 37% increase in the number The care cascades for HIV, hypertension, and diabetes in adults before and after first year (2018) of implementation in intervention communities and in Kenya, respectively. Intervention communities constitute representative 10% of the adult population (aged \u226515 years), with assumption of 90% screening uptake and treatment uptake after diagnosis of 81% for HIV, 23% for hypertension, and 45% for diabetes. NCD=non-communicable disease. ART=antiretroviral therapy. See Online for appendix of women of reproductive age in the next decade (2018-28) because of population growth, resulting in a growing need for family planning services in Nigeria. Expansion of contraceptive use to 31% was estimated to result in a 15\u00b75% reduction in the total fertility rate (ie, from 6\u00b75 children per woman at baseline to 5\u00b749 children per woman in 2028; figure 17 ). This reduction in fertility would avert more than 8 million cumulative unintended pregnancies between 2018 and 2028 when compared with a baseline level of contraceptive use of 15%. Increasing PMTCT coverage to 90% of HIVpositive pregnant women in Nigeria by 2023 is estimated to reduce the number of infants acquiring HIV by 56% ( figure 17 ), averting more than 237 500 vertical HIV transmissions cumulatively in the next decade. Expansion of PMTCT services along with family planning resulted in a further estimated 12% reduction in HIV incidence at the national level, which is equivalent to averting more than 295 500 new HIV infections by 2028 ( figure 17 ) and a 3\u00b75% reduction in populationlevel HIV prevalence. Increasing access to PMTCT would require $31\u00b73 million in 2018, which includes $17\u00b73 million in screening costs and $14\u00b70 million in PMTCT costs. With full scaleup in 2023, $172\u00b72 million would be required to identify and deliver PMTCT to an additional 142 000 HIV positive pregnant women. Although the number of women receiving PMTCT would decrease through 2028, the costs would increase slightly to $181\u00b70 million because of the larger number of pregnant women requiring screening as the prevalence of HIV decreases. From 2018 to 2028, the scaleup of PMTCT would avert 8\u00b76 million DALYs at a cost of $169 per DALY averted and, compared with the GDP per capita of $5861 in 2016, would be highly costeffective.",

Increasing the coverage of ART in MSM to 54% would avert substantial numbers of new HIV infections and AIDSrelated deaths. Further addition of PrEP can provide marginal improvements in HIVrelated outcomes, although the populationlevel implementation of PrEP in these populations in India is not costeffective. As suggested by previous studies, PrEP should be tailored to highrisk populations who stand to benefit the most from it. On the other hand, despite assuming a higher level of achievable coverage in FSW (up to 90%), similar programmes resulted in smaller improvements to HIV incidence over time in this population, primarily stemming from the decreas ing prevalence of HIV in FSW in India. Integrated programmes provide an opportunity for mass screening and treatment of other sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis. Even ignoring the potential effect for averting future syphilis transmissions and reducing the Using data from the Avahan programme, we modelled a joint community-outreach campaign for HIV and sexually transmitted infection screening in MSM over a 5-year period (2018-23). On the basis of reported levels of population coverage from Avahan, we assumed that this programme could reach 60% of MSM and 90% of FSM and will provide an infrastructure for maintaining all improvements in HIV treatment and PrEP coverage over the subsequent 5 years (2024-28). To model the potential effect on HIV-related outcomes, we assumed that this integrated intervention can successfully deliver ART to 81% of individuals with diagnosed HIV who are not currently receiving HIV treatment (ie, 90% linkage and 90% engagement). This corresponds to a 54% and 81% reduction in the unmet need for ART in HIV-positive MSM and FSM, respectively. We modelled this effect as a linear increase in the rate of ART coverage from 2018 to 2023. Furthermore, to estimate the potential effect of PrEP, we modelled two additional scenarios for implementation of oral PrEP in these two populations at low (10%) and high (30%) levels of coverage. In these scenarios, PrEP coverage was increased linearly from 2018 to 2023 (continuing at fixed levels through 2028), and PrEP adherence was assumed at 50% for those individuals on PrEP.",

We assumed no baseline coverage of any harm reduction and minimal ART coverage (26% of HIV-infected people who inject drugs in 2014). We modelled harm reduction scale-up through exploring different scenarios of harm reduction programme availability: high coverage NSP only, non-naltrexone MAT only, or combined NSP and MAT service, either alone or integrated with expanded ART for people who inject drugs. NSP and non-naltrexone MAT were assumed to reduce injecting-related HIV transmission risk. Non-naltrexone MAT was additionally assumed to increase ART recruitment rates, reduce treatment drop-out, and reduce rates of fatal overdose.

As such, there is an urgent need in Russia first for legal changes and capacity building to provide basic health services for people who inject drugs, ideally in an integrated programme that could reduce HIV, HCV, fatal overdose, and mass incarceration.

New institutional frameworks or approaches might be needed to elevate health as a central global priority and to usher into place comprehensive, integrated, and peoplecentred health systems that provide universal health access.

PMTCT=prevention of mother-to-child transmission.in subsequent years will depend in part on the rate of infection and reinfection in individuals who were previously treated.In the intervention scenarios, recruitment and HIV testing and referral costs would increase from $34\u00b71 million in 2018 to $190\u00b74 million in 2028. With 81% uptake of ART by individuals who are diagnosed, the number of people receiving ART would increase over the baseline by 55 000 in 2018 and by 107 000 in 2028. Excluding PrEP, the programme of testing and treatment would be highly costeffective, averting 2\u00b77 million DALYs at $656 per DALY averted (percapita GDP of $6571 in 2017), with an incremental cost of $1797 million over the basecase cost of $1\u00b7315 million. Neither of the PrEP scenarios (10% or 30% coverage) would be costeffective, with an incremental cost of $21 531-58 812 per DALY averted compared with the no PrEP scenario.",
