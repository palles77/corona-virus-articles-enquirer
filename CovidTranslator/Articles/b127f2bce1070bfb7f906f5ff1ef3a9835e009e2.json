[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] We previously performed two studies that evaluated the prevalence of acute respiratory viral infections in patients, including those with COPD. 8, 10 Both studies utilized cell culture and serologic methods to identify acute respiratory virus infections. Study 1 examined the frequency of specific respiratory virus infections in persons with acute respiratory tract condition that lead to hospitalization. 10 In study 2, a longitudinal cohort of COPD patients were tested for RTVIs in an ambulatory setting, although some patients were also hospitalized. 8 Respiratory viral infections were identified in 19% of COPD subjects with acute respiratory illness.",

Persons with exacerbations of COPD enrolled in this study were identified using discharge diagnosis codes (ICD9 codes 491. 2, 491.21, 492, 493.2, 496) . Study 2 was a longitudinal study conducted between September 1991 and May 1995 to evaluate the incidence of RTVIs in a cohort of 62 patients with COPD. 8 The criteria for diagnosis of COPD were as defined by the American Thoracic Society. 14 An exacerbation of COPD was defined as meeting one or more of the criteria from Anthonisen et al. 15 increased dyspnoea, sputum production or sputum purulence. RTVIs in both studies were identified by virus culture of combined nasal wash/throat swab specimens and by serologic assays as previously described. 8, 10 For this evaluation, available samples collected between September 1991 and June 1995 were used for analysis. Combined nasal wash/throat swab samples were transported to the laboratory on wet ice, inoculated onto cell culture (usually within 12 h), and then stored at K80 8C prior to the performance of viral RT-PCR assays. Microneutralization assays were used to measure antibody levels to influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza types 1, 2 and 3 viruses, and coronavirus 229E. Hemagglutination inhibition assays also were used to measure influenza A and B virus antibody, and an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure antibody to coronavirus OC43. 8, 10 RT-PCR studies",

Nucleic acids were extracted from nasal wash/throat swab samples using the Q1Amp Viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen Inc.; Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RT-PCR/PCR assays were performed as previously described using primers listed in Table  1 . 13, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] For detection of human metapneumovirus infection, cDNA was synthesized for 1 h at 43 8C. After an initial 5-minute heat denaturation at 94 8C, 40 cycles of heat denaturation at 92 8C for 15 s, annealing at 55 8C for 30 s, and primer extension at -IIA AAT TGC TII  TCT TGT TCT .

            "text": "The application of RT-PCR assays to clinical specimens collected from patients with COPD and acute respiratory illness significantly increased the number of illnesses in which an associated respiratory viral infection was identified. When culture and serologic studies were used for virus identification, 23.4% of the sampled illnesses were associated with a respiratory virus infection. The addition of RT-PCR assays increased the overall percentage of respiratory virus-associated illness to 41.8%. This is similar to the w40% of patients Seemungal et al. 3 noted to have a respiratory virus infection in association with an acute exacerbation of COPD and somewhat lower than the 56% prevalence rate Rohde et al. 22 noted in COPD patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation and the 64% reported by Seemungal et al. 9 in a later study. The percentage of dual respiratory infections (7/81, 8.6%) is also similar to rates reported in previous studies. 23 Picornaviruses and coronaviruses were the most likely viral pathogens to be detected using RT-PCR assays. Picornavirus infections, especially those caused by rhinoviruses, are the most prevalent of respiratory virus infections identified in COPD patients with acute respiratory illnesses in this (44%) and other recent studies (36-58%). 3, 22 Many rhinoviruses grow poorly in cell culture and are only detected when RT-PCR assays are used. 3, 12, 13, 24, 25 Similarly, coronaviruses are either difficult to grow (229E) or do not grow at all (OC43) using current cell culture methods, so it is not surprising that the number of infections identified increases with the application of RT-PCR techniques. Coronaviruses are associated with 11-20% of viral illnesses in COPD patients when RT-PCR assays are used. 3, 25 Influenza virus remains an important cause of virus infection in COPD patients, especially in the hospitalized patient. Fifteen of the 77 (19%) illnesses in Study 1 were associated with an influenza virus infection compared to only four of 117 (3.4%) in Study 2. Less than half of the patients in Study 1 had received influenza vaccine in the previous year while almost 90% of the patients in Study 2 had accepted influenza vaccine in the same time frame. The use of influenza vaccine is safe, effective and recommended for this population. [26] [27] [28] Nevertheless, lack of use of influenza vaccine persists as a modifiable risk factor in patients hospitalized with COPD. 29 Respiratory syncytial virus is increasingly being recognized as an important viral pathogen in older adults. [30] [31] [32] Just under 4% of the illnesses evaluated in the two studies were associated with RSV infection, a number similar to that observed in some studies but lower than that reported in others. 3, 22, 33 Differences in methods used to identify RSV infection and differences in the sensitivities in the RT-PCR assays likely contribute to the differences observed between studies. 34 Human metapneumovirus is a newly recognized paramyxovirus that causes lower respiratory disease in children. 35, 36 The importance of this pathogen in adults is less well defined. Falsey et al. 37 found up to 10% of subjects admitted with acute cardiopulmonary conditions had serologic evidence of acute human metapneumovirus infection. Prevalence rates were somewhat lower in an ambulatory geriatric population, and there was considerable variability between the two study years. Cases of human metapneumovirus infection also have been observed in elderly patients hospitalized with chronic lower respiratory diseases or immunosuppression. 38, 39 In contrast, we failed to identify any illnesses associated with human metapneumovirus infection. Our RT-PCR assay for human metapneumovirus was designed to detect all known groups of human metapneumovirus and has detected these viruses in another study involving hospitalized children (unpublished data), differences in assay performance could explain the results observed. Alternatively, virus circulation during the seasons studied may have been low enough to prevent detection. 37 A potential weakness of this study is that we did not evaluate the impact of respiratory viruses in our two populations during times of clinical stability. Seemungal et al. 9 reported detection of respiratory viruses other than RSV in 16% of COPD patients during clinical stability and detection of RSV in 23.5%. We have recently completed an evaluation of another cohort of chronic bronchitic patients during periods of clinical stability (unpublished data). The prevalence of RT-PCR positivity (excluding coronavirus 229E and human metapneumovirus) ranged from 0 to 2% for individual agents, with an overall prevalence of 6.4% in 143 encounters. The overall frequency of identification of a respiratory viral infection during illness was similar to that seen in this study. Thus, our experience with the application of RT-PCR assays to cohorts with COPD differs from that described by Seemungal et al. 9 In summary, the application of RT-PCR assays to clinical specimens collected from patients with COPD during clinical respiratory illness significantly increased the number of respiratory viruses identified. Rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and influenza viruses were the most common respiratory virus infections in this patient population, and no human metapneumovirus infections were found. Respiratory virus infections are an important cause of respiratory illness in COPD patients.",
