            "text": "The effect of liposome-encapsulation on the immunomodulating and antiviral activities of interferon-7 (IFN-),) was evaluated in this study. The immunomodulating activity was measured by increases in phagocytic activity and in nitric oxide production by peritoneal macrophages from mice treated with both free and LIP-IFN-7 (4000 U/mouse, intraperitoneal injection). Resident peritoneal macrophages harvested from mice treated with free unencapsulated IFN-7 or muramyl dipeptide showed significant increases in macrophage yield, and enhanced ability to phagocytize zymosan particles. In mice treated with liposome-encapsulated IFN-7 (LIP-IFN-7), both macrophage yield and phagocytic activity further increased by 2-fold over unencapsulated IFN-7. In addition, the activation of peritoneal macrophages with LIP-IFN-7 showed enhanced production of NO when the cells were cultured ex vivo. Using a murine respiratory influenza infection model, intranasally administered LIP-IFN-~ conferred protection to 70% in mice challenged intranasally with 10 LDs0 doses of influenza A/PR/8 virus compared with a 20% survival rate using free IFN-7. Together these results suggest that liposome-encapsulation increases the immunomodulating and antiviral activities of IFN-7. Liposome-encapsulation of IFN-7 may provide additional therapeutic advantages by reducing IFN-7 toxicity while prolonging its body retention.",

IFN-7 is also an important regulator of a number of immunological functions such as increasing the expression of major histocompatibility antigens and regulating the production of antibody by B-lymphocytes (Joklik, 1990) . IFN-7 stimulates macrophage function by increasing the macrophage production of interleukin-1 and hydrogen peroxide (Joklik, 1990) . Thus, activation of macrophages by IFN-7 may play an important role in their ability to destroy invading microorganisms, particularly infectious viruses or parasites. More recently, interferons have been demonstrated to stimulate the production of reactive nitrogen intermediates, in particular, nitric oxide (NO), which mediates intracellular killing and a wide range of host responses (Fortier et al., 1992; Green and Nacy, 1993; Zhang et al., 1994) including the inhibition of viral replication (Karupiah et al., 1993) .",

However, the therapeutic potential of IFN-7 as an antimicrobial or immunomodulating agent is limited by its partial effectiveness in vivo and its known toxicities to cardiac, renal and CNS functions (Joklik, 1990; Quesada et al., 1986 ). In addition, as a small protein, IFN-,/ administered into the body is likely to be subjected to immediate dilution, rapid clearance from the body and may not reach its target cells (Bino et al., 1982; Gutterman et al., 1984; Kurzrock et al., 1985) . These problems can potentially be overcome with the use of a liposome delivery system for Liposomes are microscopic lipid vesicles which have a number of characteristics making them an attractive drug delivery system for various antimicrobial and immunomodulating agents Poste et al., 1980; Gregoriadis, 1990; Wong et al., 1992) . Therapeutic agents encapsulated within liposomes can be protected from in vivo degradation and dilution Poste et al., 1980; Wong et al., 1994) . The encapsulated drugs are readily released from liposomes in a gradual and sustained manner, thus increasing their prophylactic/therapeutic efficacies while reducing their intrinsic toxicities Poste et al., 1980 Poste et al., , 1984 Petenazzo et al., 1989) . Liposomes are particularly well suited as carriers of macrophage stimulating agents such as IFN-7 since they are readily taken up by the macrophages upon systemic, pulmonary or peritoneal administration and the agents can be delivered to macrophages in concentrated levels Poste et al., 1980 Poste et al., , 1984 , without adversely affecting healthy, non-target cells.",

Its potential efficacy against viral infections, however, remains unexploited. In addition, the effect of liposome-encapsulation on the intrinsic immunomodulation effect of IFN-~ has not been studied extensively. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a liposome delivery system in potentiating the antiviral as well as immunomodulatory activities of IFN-),. The specific modulation of cell-mediated immunity by free and liposome-encapsulated IFN-), (LIP-IFN-7) was determined by increase in macrophage activation, measured by increased phagocytic activity and production of NO. The antiviral activity was assessed in vivo for the efficacy of IFN-7 and LIP-IFN-~ to protect mice against a lethal respiratory influenza A infection. The approach to use a delivery system for IFN-r may provide a useful means to enhance the host's defence resistance to respiratory virus infections, and has the potential to decrease the inherent toxicity associated with the use of interferons.",

The lipids were then rehydrated with 1 ml of 100 mM HEPES buffer in normal saline, pH 6.7 (HEPES buffer). IFN-7 was then added to the lipid mixture and freeze-dried overnight (total volume of 400 ktl, 100 000 U/ml). The mixture was reconstituted in 100 ~tl of HEPES buffer and vortexed for 2-3 min. The reconstituted liposomes were then left for rehydration for 2 h at room temperature and then were washed twice with 8 ml of HEPES buffer and ultracentrifuged at 125 000 x g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C after incubating at room temperature for 2 h. After ultracentrifugation, the liposome pellets were resuspended in 1 ml HEPES buffer prior to use. The liposomes were negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate (pH 7.4) and the morphology and vesicle size distribution were analyzed by electron microscopy.

IFN-7 may be considered useful in the prevention of respiratory influenza infection since it provokes both an antiviral and immunomodulating response in the susceptible host. However, one of the major drawbacks of interferon therapy is that interferons are toxic molecules which can cause severe toxicities to the central nervous system, renal and cardiac functions (Quesada et al., 1986; Joklik, 1990) . Although the effect of liposome-encapsulation on IFN-v toxicities was not determined in this present study, Hockertz et al. (1991) had demonstrated that toxic effects seen in mice injected with IFN-7, such as necrotic lesions, loss of body weight and MHC class II expression, were absent in mice treated with the same dose of INF-7 encapsulated in liposomes. Therefore, liposomeencapsulation may prove extremely valuable in interferon immunotherapy because liposomes have the potential to significantly reduce interferon toxicities through their slow release characteristics. In addition, the targeting of IFN-~ by liposomes to specific infection sites may therefore avoid causing toxic effects in non-target cells and organs (Hockertz et al., 1991; Melissen et al., 1993) .",

This liposome type has been shown by a number of investigators to be more efficiently taken up by macrophages than positively-charged or unilamellar vesicles Poste et al., 1980 Poste et al., , 1984 . The freeze-dry method was used for the production of liposomes because it is a relatively mild method that does not require IFN-7 to be exposed to organic solvent, sonication or detergent and this method has been previously demonstrated to be suitable for the encapsulation of a number of biologically active compounds Poste et al., 1980; Wong et al., 1992 Wong et al., , 1994 . LIP-IFN-7 administered to mice appears to act as chemotactic agent for phagocytic cells resulting in a 5-fold increase in accumulated peritoneal macrophages in comparison with placebo-treated controls. The chemotactic nature observed with LIP-IFN-7 may be entirely or in part due to liposome effect since sham liposomes also resulted in an increased ac-cumulation of peritoneal macrophages, although this increase of macrophage accumulation due to sham liposomes did not result in an increased protection against viral infection in vivo. The chemotactic nature of LIP-IFN-7 presents an effective mechanism of delivery whereby the encapsulated IFN-y may be released gradually from the liposomes into close proximity of the congregating macrophages. Multilamellar liposomes have been shown to be naturally taken up by pulmonary macrophages via phagocytosis Fidler et al., 1980; Fidler, 1988) . The uptake of LIP-INF-y by macrophages has been reported to allow the IFN-7 to bind to intracellular receptors of macrophages (Fidler et al., 1985) . In addition, IFN may exert its antiviral effect on the target cells in the lungs via a receptor-independent delivery of IFN provided by liposome delivery (Killion and Fidler, 1993) .",

Our findings that IFN-7 alone did not induce nitrite production in peritoneal macrophages appear to be consistent with this observation. However, when IFN-7 was administered in its liposomal form, significant levels of nitrite were produced. Liposomes may, therefore, provide the same type of phagocytic stimulus previously observed to stimulate NO production. Since liposomes are readily taken up by macrophages, IFN-7 may be directly released from the liposomes into the intracellular compartment. However, this phagocytic route of entry may also result in the lysosomal degradation of the liposomes as well as IFN-7. To overcome this potential problem, we are investigating the feasibility of developing 'fusogenic' liposomes to be capable of fusing directly with the membrane of the target cells, thus permitting content of the liposomes to be delivered intracellularly bypassing the degradative phagocytic process (Nayar and Schroit, 1989) .",

Protection against influenza mortality could be observed in mice pretreated with free and LIP-IFN-7. The major advantage of this approach is a single dose of LIP-IFN-7 provided the same level of protection to mice as 3 doses of IFN-7. Three days of pretreatment with LIP-IFN-7 resulted in up to 70% survival of infected mice, compared to 20% for IFN-7 treated mice. This increase in IFN-7 efficacy may also to be the result of the increased retention of IFN-~, in the lungs afforded by liposome encapsulation. Indeed, radiotracer studies using ~25I-IgG indicated that lung retention of liposome-encapsulated IgG was 3-fold more than unencapsulated IgG even at 24 h post-administration (Wong et al., 1994) . The observed decrease in survival after 4 days of LIP-IFN-7 pretreatment may reflect a relatively narrow optimum dose range for IFN-7 (Merigan, 1987) .",

Liposome-encapsulation of IFN-7 results in increased non-specific cell-mediated immunity and increased survival against lethal doses of influenza A. A major benefit of this form of treatment is that the gradual release of IFN-7 from liposomes allows the host immune system time to elicit a natural specific immune response to fight the infection. In addition, the ability of LIP-IFN-7 to augment the production of NO by mouse macrophages may play an important role in the further enhancing the body's defence mechanisms to fight viral infections. NO is an effector molecule produced by various mammalian cell types including macrophages. NO and its oxidized intermediates, nitrite (NO2-) and nitrate (NO3-), are known to play a important role in the cell-mediated killing of a wide range of pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses (Karupiah et al., 1993) This present study demonstrates that liposomeencapsulation can significantly affect the antiviral and immunomodulating activities of IFN-7. Liposome delivery was found to enhance the non-specific activation of macrophages, resulting in increased phagocytic activity and NO production. The efficacy of IFN-7 to protect mice against lethal respiratory infection by influenza A virus was also significantly improved by liposome-encapsulation. These immunological and therapeutic advantages, in combination with the potential of liposome delivery to significantly reduce IFN-7's intrinsic toxicity, may therefore provide a valuable and beneficial approach for the clinical use of IFN-7 for antiviral and immunotherapy.",
