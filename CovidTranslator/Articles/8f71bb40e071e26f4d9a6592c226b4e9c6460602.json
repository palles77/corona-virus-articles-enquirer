Economic circumstances in generating and receiving countries help to shape fl ows of tourists and their spending patterns and the nature and speed of development, which also react to general economic movements. Such economic forces may operate to create both opportunities and problems for the tourism industry, certain of the latter having the potential to evolve into a crisis.",

Attention is also given to how the economic impacts of tourism may themselves be a cause or catalyst of crises and measures that can be adopted to lessen the risk of these occurring. Case studies at the end of the chapter explain how outbound tourism from Japan has been damaged by economic uncertainty and describe the repercussions of the 1997 Asian fi nancial crisis for tourist activity, both indicative of the linkages which connect tourism and economics.",

Depending on the nature of change, it will stimulate or depress demand in source markets and make destinations more or less attractive regarding prices and products. Costs of travel and perceptions of these costs, as well as an individual's fi nancial position, also play an important part in vacation decisions. The health of an economy additionally helps to determine resources available for investment at home and abroad in the transport, accommodation and attractions sectors which are essential to tourism. Business travel too benefi ts from the heightened trading which is generated by economic progress (Davidson and Cope, 2003) .",

This was evident during the years following the Second World War in the West when rises in personal disposable income allowed lower and middle income groups to spend more on tourism than ever before. Destination choices expanded from nearby locations to more distant centers with a corresponding shift from national to intra-regional and then inter-regional travel (Murphy, 1985) . Such a trend was later apparent amongst the Asian \"tiger\" economies of Korea, Taiwan and Singapore and is now spreading to other countries experiencing development. Affl uent middle classes of consumers are emerging, notably in China which has seen rapid expansion in domestic and international tourism fueled by its exceptional economic achievements (Zhang et al., 2000) .",

The recession of the 1990s on the US mainland contributed to a decline in Hawaii's tourism from 1990 to 1993, and Japan's economic diffi culties had adverse consequences for its outbound tourism in the same decade, including travel to Hawaii (see Case One). Deterioration in the global economy at the end of the twentieth century was considered partly responsible for a slowing down in worldwide tourism, recovery believed to be driven partly by the economic cycle. At the same time, domestic industries can gain from these reversals as it seems that many tourists choose less expensive options and remain closer to home when anxious about monetary and employment matters. Such a pattern of response suggests the importance of drawing tourists from a range of overseas markets, rather than relying on only a few, together with the need for domestic promotion.",

            "text": "Currency values and their fl uctuation are an additional determinant of tourist trends and investment. Substantial alterations are felt by tourists and refl ected in the prices charged by operators and agents with consequences for demand. An exceptionally strong currency may deter inbound visitors but encourage outbound travel, as demonstrated by Switzerland, where the hotel industry confronted a crisis due to uncompetitive prices in the 1990s. Switzerland became an expensive destination for foreigners while its nationals were lured abroad to take advantage of their enhanced purchasing power there, accommodation occupancy levels declining as a result. Hotels were advised to be more creative and energetic in their marketing in order to regain lost market share and attract more mature travelers interested in escaping from the stresses of everyday life to the delights of an alpine environment (Marvel and Johnson, 1997) . A markedly appreciating currency and prevailing notions of the costliness of locations are thus challenges for the tourism industry, which must strive to offset a drop in arrivals by stimulating greater expenditure among those who do elect to visit. A currency which is falling dramatically in value does not inevitably boost arrivals and excessive volatility may deter investors and make tour operators and travel agents cautious about selling places thus affl icted. The Turkish lira depreciated by 70% over a few days at the beginning of 2001, but this did not have a favorable effect on inbound tourism and severely curtailed departures (Okumus et al., 2005) . Brazil's 2002 currency crisis led to an overall contraction in inbound visitors, especially from other Latin American countries (Euromonitor, 2004) like Argentina where there was also economic and political turmoil. Visitors caught up in the chaos were seriously inconvenienced and tourists in Buenos Aries described being unable to cash travelers checks or use credit cards because of emergency banking measures intended to stem cash withdrawals. Surcharges were imposed and retailers raised prices in anticipation of a continuation in the collapse of the peso. Outbreaks of violence were reported (BBC News, 2002b) , indicative of how economic anxieties can fuel broader unrest which might endanger tourist safety.",

Studies suggest different experiences and the presence of success factors which enabled some destinations to manage the crisis better than others. While at the heart of the economic turbulence, Thailand exhibited an ability to weather the storm attributable to its long-standing reputation as a tourist destination, range of attractions and amenities and intensive advertising. Indeed, the crisis was exploited as an opportunity to reposition Thailand as a country of nature-based, cultural and MICE (meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions) tourism rather than mass tourism coastal resorts. Indonesia lacked these advantages and the economic crisis there was a source of a social and political agitation, posing a more serious threat to tourism and impeding effective action and the pace of recovery (Henderson, 1999a) .",

Such environmental damage must be factored into any analysis which attempts to calculate the overall value of tourism for destinations (Tisdell, 2001 ). There will be additional spending on administration, planning and marketing and authorities may offer an assortment of subsidies and rebates to developers and operators in a bid to win projects and investment. In some situations, host communities appear to be subsidizing tourism and this could provoke hostility which is aggravated when tourist demand infl ates prices for goods and services. Land and property may become more expensive and perhaps exceed the reach of the local population. Outsiders from second home owners to foreign hotel developers are thus privileged at the expense of residents and these issues can be a matter of political contention, any disputes interfering with the functioning and prospects of the tourism industry.",

Financial constraints delayed existing and new projects, some of which were abandoned. There were doubts about the survival of some businesses and a number of hotels chose to charge in US dollars so that guests were denied the advantages of lower prices due to weak currencies. Events attracted widespread media coverage around the world and several stories were devoted to the social and political tensions associated with economic collapse.

Emphasis was given particularly to increased domestic and international promotion. Attempts were made at innovation in pursuit of a more diversifi ed product offering and wider market. However, National Tourism Organizations (NTOs) found that the purchasing power of their budgets was substantially reduced outside Asia and therefore explored possibilities of partnerships and greater private sponsorship. The fi nancial allocation of marketers was cut in some cases and they had to cope with this alongside rationalization of air services due to declining passenger traffi c, higher accommodation costs and a heavier taxation burden on tourists.",

Most of the tourist destinations which had been hit were also returning to normality and actually drawing more international arrivals than they had been prior to the onset of the crisis. Nevertheless, tourism was revealed to be very vulnerable to economic change and its full recovery was also dependent upon economic improvement.
