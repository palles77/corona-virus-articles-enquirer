The literature is limited regarding studies of HCWs' use of PPE in patient care tasks. Methods: A pilot study was conducted to examine the feasibility of using a simulated health care environment to assess HCWs' technique when implementing standard airborne and contact isolation precautions. The participants (n 5 10) were assigned patient care tasks based on their specific professional roles. The encounters were digitally recorded during donning and doffing of PPE, as well as during interactions with the simulated patient. Powdered fluorescent marker was used as a measure of contamination.",

Conducting a study of this topic in an actual patient care area would raise both ethical and legal concerns. At the bedside, such a study would involve not only allowing an error to occur, but also documenting the occurrence of poor behavior. Consequently, we conducted a study in a simulated patient care environment to examine the feasibility of using a fluorescent marker to monitor for contamination and videotaping to assess HCWs' adherence to the use of standard airborne and contact isolation precautions.",

The potential for errors in PPE technique is significant. For instance, a poorly sealed respirator might not provide the necessary protection when caring for a patient with a contagious respiratory illness. Certain hairstyles could prevent the proper alignment of respirator straps for the best face seal. Touching a soiled bedsheet or patient gown with a glove or isolation gown could easily transfer microorganisms to the HCW's face or hands if PPE is removed in the improper order. Tying only one gown fastener or not placing the entire dirty gown inside a hamper in a contact isolation room could result in exposure of garments and later aerosolization of infectious particles. Many such errors occur repeatedly during patient care activities, given the lack quality control at the bedside. Infection control programs need to focus not only on the policies for the use of PPE, but also on the quality of the PPE techniques used while caring for patients. Historically, simulation has been used in various educational strategies and tools in medical education, including skill trainers, computer-based modules, simulated patients (live actors), and high-fidelity human patient simulator manikins. 4 In recent years, the nursing literature has exploded with content on simulation. Kaakinen and Arwood 5 conducted a systematic review of this literature, with a focus on the use of learning theory. Of the 120 articles on nursing simulation that they cited, 94 discussed simulation as a teaching strategy. Only 16 articles described learning as the basis of the simulation development, and only 2 articles examined cognitive changes as a result of participation in the simulation.",

Videotaping a patient care skill to demonstrate competency along with performance feedback has been used successfully in nursing students. 6 Kinsella 7 described Sch\u20ac on's theory of reflective practice as balancing technical rationality and research-based knowledge with the wisdom of experience.

In another study, Hassan et al 16 investigated hand hygiene using videotaping and selfreporting in a private hospital in Jordan. The major findings included overall low compliance, lower levels of compliance in higher-acuity settings, and sexrelated differences in hand hygiene.

The study was conducted in a simulated patient care environment, with a study team member acting as the patient. The simulated patient followed a specific narrative for the scenario and engaged in conversation with the HCW during the patient care encounter. The simulation room had features of a typical patient care room, including a hospital bed, wall unit with pressurized air, storage cabinets, television, bedside table, and tray table. Immediately outside the room were an isolation cart and handwashing facilities. The room had two discretely mounted cameras in the ceiling that could be positioned and focused in real time from a neighboring viewing room. The cameras fed into an audiovisual retrieval system to which the digital videos could be downloaded from secured system servers for data analysis. In addition, another high-definition digital camera was strategically placed outside the room to better capture the HCW's PPE donning and room exiting behaviors. This allowed for consistent capturing of the underlying sources of contamination for each HCW during the 3 stages of the simulation: PPE donning, patient care, and PPE doffing.

In a pandemic simulation exercise conducted over 24 hours in a nursing unit following procedures mandated by the United Kingdom pandemic influenza infection control guideline, HCWs demonstrated uncertainty in such areas as donning and removal of PPE and decontamination of room equipment. 18 Retrospective reviews of outbreaks such as SARS and novel H1N1 have shown inconsistent use of PPE in HCWs who developed infection. Possible barriers to adherence in these outbreaks may include personal beliefs, fatigue, inadequate training or systematic approaches, and lack of PPE supplies. 12, 16 The results of these previous studies support the need for further studies related to training in and reinforcement of PPE techniques for HCWs.",

As noted previously, a compliance study using videotaping by Hassan et al 16 found similar low levels of compliance with handwashing in an actual patient care setting. Actions such as neglecting to check the seal of the mask or neglecting to tie the gown at both the neck and the waist have been commonly observed in practice by the research team. Some of the actions observed in the present study were less predictable, such as leaving the room without completing the doffing sequence and unnecessarily touching surfaces in the room. The number of participants who performed PPE donning and doffing out of sequence was higher than expected. We had anticipated a smaller number in the group that had access to the CDC guideline poster in the donning and doffing areas, but that did not prove to be the case.",

The participants sometimes put their gloved hands on surfaces contaminated with the fluorescent marker and then touched an area such as the face. We were not always able to document the transfer to the face under the black light when we evaluated the individual for fluorescent marker contamination once he or she completed the simulation experience. In some other cases, small paper towel fragments on the participant's hands following hand hygiene initially appeared to be massive contamination of the hands with the fluorescent marker. This might have skewed our data related to hand contamination. This problem possibly could be resolved in future studies by using a different color of powdered fluorescent marker. The most common location of actual fluorescent marker contamination was on the back of the head, which the review of the video capture identified as resulting from an incorrect PPE doffing sequence. Casanova et al 14 used the same fluorescent marker in their study on removing PPE in 10 participants, but they directly contaminated the surface of the PPE before the patient care task and PPE removal. They also found the fluorescent marker to be an inconsistent contamination indicator. The use of a fluorescent maker alone in training scenarios might not adequately demonstrate the potential for transfer of infectious materials and might inadvertently reinforce poor technique. The video recording seems to provide a more reliable account of HCW behaviors.",
