Data were used from a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial into the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in which smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of the trial. A total of 1838 subjects aged 60 years or older, of whom 1531 subjects (321 smokers, 1152 non-smokers and 58 cigar/pipe smokers) who returned the smoking questionnaire and were not previously vaccinated, were used in the analyses. The main outcome measures were serological in\u00afuenza (fourfold increase of antibody titre between 3 weeks and 5 months after vaccination); clinical in\u00afuenza as determined by criteria of the Dutch Sentinel Stations from self reported symptoms in postal questionnaires 10 weeks and 5 months after vaccination; increases after vaccination and decreases after 5 months in logarithmic titres of antibody against the vaccine strains. No relation between smoking and either serological or clinical in\u00afuenza was found, although the risk for serological in\u00afuenza was slightly (not signi\u00aecantly) elevated in smokers compared to non-smokers. A statistical interaction was found between smoking and vaccination when serological in\u00afuenza was the outcome measure indicating that the ecacy of vaccination was greater in smokers than in non-smokers (comparison of model with and without interaction; likelihood ratio test, p < 0.0001). This \u00aending is supported by a greater titre rise 3 weeks after vaccination for two out of four strains, but not by the antibody response after vaccination in previous studies on in\u00afuenza and other infectious diseases. Also, this possible dierence of immunogenicity is not re\u00afected in a better protection for clinical in\u00afuenza. The rise in antibody titre 3 weeks after vaccination was higher in smokers for A/Singapore/6/86 and B/Beijing/11/87, but not for the other two strains. Decline in titres after 5 months was similar for smokers and non-smokers. We conclude that smoking has no clinical or preventive signi\u00aecance for risk of in\u00afuenza in the elderly. #",

            "text": "An eect of smoking on in\u00afuenza would be more plausible if smoking in\u00afuences the susceptibility to other viral infections as well. Cohen et al. found that smokers were at greater risk for getting common colds than non-smokers [16] . Smokers were more likely both to develop infection with rhinoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and coronavirus (OR = 2.23; 95% CI = 1.03, 4.82) and to develop illness following infection with these viruses (OR = 1.83; 95% CI = 1.00, 3.36). In their review on cigarette smoking [17] . To summarize, studies on non-in\u00afuenza respiratory infections consistently show smokers to be at an increased risk. Vaccination of smokers against in\u00afuenza was serologically more ecacious compared to non-smokers in our study (see Table 3 ). As this was not expected and no other studies investigated the ecacy of in\u00afuenza vaccination in smokers and non-smokers, we sought support for this \u00aending in the antibody response after vaccination. A greater titre rise due to vaccination was observed in smokers compared to non-smokers for two out of four strains 3 weeks after vaccination. A greater antibody response was also found by Finklea et al. [9] . In their study pre-vaccination titres (that were lower for smokers than non-smokers) leveled up after vaccination. A possible explanation is that smokers develop a better immunological protection after vaccination, resulting in a lower incidence of serological in\u00afuenza compared to non-smokers. The clinical relevance of this \u00aending appears to be low, because no dierence in ecacy of vaccination was found for clinical in\u00afuenza between smokers and non-smokers in our study. Also, MacKenzie et al. and Knowles et al. found no greater antibody response in smokers compared to non-smokers after vaccination with in\u00afuenza vaccine [3, 8] . Instead, hepatitis B vaccination has been shown to be less immunogenic in smokers versus nonsmokers in several studies [18\u00b120]. For example, for subjects receiving hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1 and 6 months (standard schedule) it was found that vaccinated smokers had lower antibody levels than nonsmokers after 3, 7 and 13 months [18] . In summary, the tendency for smokers to have a higher antibody response than non-smokers found in our study is not found in other studies on in\u00afuenza vaccination (except Finklea et al.) and hepatitis B vaccination. The greater protection against serological in\u00afuenza in smokers Table 3 The ecacy of vaccination in smoker and non-smoker for people not previously vaccinated (rate as %) [14] . e Not corrected for covariables. f Corrected for age, sex, risk group and protective titre before vaccination. g Dierence in ecacy between smoker and non-smoker was signi\u00aecant (likelihood ratio = 11.81; p < 0.005; corrected for age, sex and risk group). Table 2 The eect of smoking on the incidence rate of in\u00afuenza in people not previously vaccinated and strati\u00aeed according to current vaccination status (rate as %) compared to non-smokers found in our study is therefore hardly supported by other immunological data. In our study the decline in titres 5 months after vaccination was similar for smokers and non-smokers, which is consistent with the \u00aending of Knowles et al. after a 3 month follow-up [8] . However, MacKenzie et al. and Finklea et al. found a depressed persistence of hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody after 1 year in smokers compared to non-smokers [3, 9] . This raises the question if a depressed antibody titre in smokers compared to non-smokers after vaccination manifests itself only after several months. However, this question can not be decided with our data that covers a period of 5 months.",

            "text": "It is important to consider potential limitations regarding the internal validity of the design. A possible bias is that the measurement of the smoking status could be in\u00afuenced by the outcome of clinical in\u00afuenza, because smoking status was measured 10 weeks after the start of the investigation. However, the hypotheses about smoking were not known to the patients during the data collection, making it unlikely that patients tried to report their smoking status dierently in order to please the investigators or to try and explain why they got in\u00afuenza. Selection biases are unlikely to occur because the data used in this study resulted from a randomized clinical trial. Beyer et al., Palache, Gross et al. and Poirier et al. pointed out some shortcomings in the research on in\u00afuenza vaccination [6, 21\u00b123] . In many studies on the ecacy of vaccination pre-vaccination titres, previous vaccination status, age, gender and the health status were not taken into account. In our study previously vaccinated patients were excluded, no dierences were found in pre-titres for smokers and non-smokers and corrections were made for age, gender and health status. Also vaccine doses are relevant for the interpretation of the results [23] . These vaccine doses were the same for all subjects. The in\u00afuenza activity in the in\u00afuenza season 1991\u00b11992 in the Netherlands was dominated by the strains A/Singapore/6/86 (H1N1) and A/Beijing/353/89 (H3N2) and therefore matched Geometric mean titre (GMT) = 10 logtitre : change(GMT) = 10 logchangevalue *10 logprevalue \u00c010 logprevalue . a CI indicates con\u00aedence interval. b Corrected for age, sex and risk group, but not for protective titre before vaccination (possible intermediate factor). c Subjects with serological in\u00afuenza were excluded (=a titre at end-titre r4 times the titre at post-titre) causing a small dierence to occur in the post-titre used in post-titre\u00b1pre-titre compared to the post-titre used in end-titre\u00b1post-titre. at least two of the strains used in the vaccine for that season [24] . In summary, no real threats to the validity of our results are found.",

A slightly elevated, but not signi\u00aecant, risk for serological in\u00afuenza in the placebo group was found in smokers compared to non-smokers. This was consistent with previous studies, but did not result in a clinical dierence. Smokers were better protected than non-smokers against serological in\u00afuenza after vaccination and titre rise due to vaccination was higher in smokers than non-smokers for some (but not all) strains. However, little support for this \u00aending was found in the antibody response after vaccination in previous studies on in\u00afuenza or other infectious diseases. Finally, smokers did not have a lower immune titre 5 months after vaccination compared to non-smokers. We conclude that smoking may enhance the immunological response to vaccination in smokers, resulting in a higher protection against serological in\u00afuenza in smokers compared to non-smokers. Nevertheless, we found no clinically sig-ni\u00aecant eect of smoking on risk of in\u00afuenza and vaccine ecacy.",
