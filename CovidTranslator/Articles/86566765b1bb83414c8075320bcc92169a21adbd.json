Animal workers may encounter hundreds to thousands of animals each day, which increases the risk of exposure to biological, physical, and chemical hazards. In recent years a number of emerging infectious diseases have first appeared-as deadly outbreaks among workers with animal exposures. In addition to zoonotic disease risks, high rates of allergic disease, physical injuries, and psychological stress have also been reported in animal handlers. Many animal workers in both developing and developed countries are not enrolled in formal occupational safety and health programs or may receive medical care from human health care providers who are not familiar with the occupational risks these workers face.",

However, many individuals who work part-time or full-time with animals may receive little or no preventive health services related to their work exposures. For example, staff at pet swap meets, pet store employees, volunteers at zoos and county fair animal exhibits, wildlife rehabilitators, wildlife biologists, volunteer animal rescue workers, individuals engaged in home slaughter of animals for family consumption, and subsistence (bushmeat) hunters may all face significant \"occupational\" health risks related to their contact with animals, yet may never receive preplacement examinations, prophylactic vaccinations, or follow-up surveillance examinations to prevent or detect work-related disease. If they do see a medical provider for care of a work-related injury or illness, that medical provider may not be aware of the range of health risks these workers face, and therefore the treatment or recommendations for prevention may not be optimal.",

The veterinarian may be the health professional who is most familiar to the workers and with whom the workers have established a trusting relationship. The veterinarian may also be in regular contact with the employer or worksite supervisor and be able to advocate for the provision of occupational health services for the workers.

            "text": "A hazard related to work around areas of bird or bat droppings is the exposure to potentially pathogenic fungi including Histoplasma, Cryptococcus, and Blastomyces. Histoplasma capsulatum is a fungus that exists in two forms: a mold form in the soil environment and a yeast form that develops when human beings or other animals inhale or ingest the spores. Although many infected human beings are asymptomatic, some may develop complications ranging from mild flulike illness to chronic lung and eye infections and pericarditis. 29 Skin infection can also occur. Immunocompromised individuals are at increased risk of severe disease. The nutrients in bird or bat guano can encourage the growth of spores in the environment. Therefore areas of pigeon and other bird roosting where bird droppings accumulate may be more likely to have high levels of H. capsulatum spores that can lead to inhalation or ingestion by human beings. Poultry litter can also contain Histoplasma spores. Farmers, construction workers, forestry workers, and other workers exposed to disturbed soil or poultry guano can be at risk of infection, especially if individuals are immunocompromised. Unlike birds, bats appear to shed infectious Histoplasma in their droppings. Caves and other areas where bat guano accumulates have been associated with human cases of histoplasmosis. 30 The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has published guidelines for reduction of occupational risk of Histoplasma infection that also can be applied to the risk of other fungal pathogens such as Cryptococcus and Blastomyces. These guidelines include the use of respiratory protection, disposable protective clothing and shoe coverings, and gloves that avoid skin trauma to reduce the risk of skin infection. The types of respirators that should be worn during occupational activities with exposures to spore-contaminated dusts depend on intensity of exposure. In low-risk situations (e.g., site surveys of bird roosts), disposable, filtering facepiece respirators may be adequate, whereas extremely dusty work such as removing accumulated bird or bat manure from an enclosed area such as a barn or attic may require full-facepiece, powered air-purifying respirators. 31 Cryptococcus is another genus of potentially pathogenic fungi found in soil. Like Histoplasma, high concentrations of Cryptococcus spores can be found in soil enriched by bird droppings. Cryptococcus neoformans is found worldwide and can cause significant infections, including meningitis, in immunocompromised individuals. However, C. neoformans has not been extensively associated with occupational or environmental exposures. In contrast, Cryptococcus gatii infection (a species formerly thought to be confined to the tropics) has been tied to environmental and occupational exposures to disturbed contaminated soil in both human beings and domestic animals (including cats, a ferret, and a llama) in North America. In these recent outbreaks, human C. gatii infection has involved both chronic pulmonary manifestations as well as meningitis. 32 Another fungus associated with environmental exposures is Blastomyces, which can cause chronic lung disease in human beings and other animals as well as extrapulmonary manifestations. The typical human case of blastomycosis related to occupational or environmental exposure is a male who works or recreates outdoors where there is wildlife activity. A history of a pet dog with the disease helps support the diagnosis because dogs appear to act as sentinels for environmental exposure risk. 33 ",

Taking an occupational health approach to such hazards involves using a hierarchy of controls that range from most effective to least effective methods to reduce the health risks to workers. This hierarchy is listed in Table 12 -2. Many hazards can be eliminated at the source, or a less-dangerous substance or process can be substituted. Engineering controls include physical methods to reduce exposures such as improved ventilation and use of nonporous surfaces on counters that can be easily disinfected. Administrative and work practice controls involve job restrictions for susceptible persons, limiting individual worker exposure times in high-exposure areas, and preventive practices such as hand hygiene. Reliance on personal protective equipment such as gloves, gowns, and respirators is considered to be the least effective and often most cumbersome approach to hazard control. Table 12-1 shows examples of such controls for handling biological, chemical, physical, and psychosocial hazards in animal work. Obviously the most effective controls vary by the specific type of hazard, and the occupational health team must consider the most feasible type of control for each particular hazard. Although they may require a greater upfront investment, controls at the top of the hierarchy, such as elimination, substitution, or engineering controls, may be most cost effective at preventing work-related health problems. For example, eliminating a zoonotic disease (such as brucellosis) in an animal population through vaccination and other preventive veterinary care may be more cost effective over time than relying on personal protective equipment such as respirators and gloves for animal workers. Similarly, substituting a less-toxic cleaning agent (see Chapter 8) may be more cost effective in reducing health complaints of eye and throat irritation among exposed workers than the use of gloves and respirators.",

To do this, the medical provider may need to consult a veterinarian, biosafety professional, or other members of the occupational health team to learn more about specific risks of the job. For example, a person with valvular heart disease may need to be restricted from working in a research facility with pregnant sheep because of the risk of Q fever. A worker who developed allergy to mice or rats in a previous job may need to be restricted from future contact with such animals. In discussing disease risks with other professionals, it is important (although sometimes a challenge) to keep medical information about the worker confidential and prevent possible workplace discrimination because of a medical condition. If work restrictions are necessary, they can be indicated on a work status form that can be given to the employer to outline such restrictions without revealing confidential health information about the employee. In general, confidential health information on employees should not be shared with the employer, supervisor, or other management personnel by the human health clinician evaluating the worker. 42 Vaccinations A number of preventive vaccinations may be indicated for animal workers. Previous vaccination history should be assessed at the preplacement evaluation and the need for additional vaccination determined. As with other aspects of the preplacement risk assessment, consultation with a veterinarian may be advisable or clear instructions conveyed to the health care provider regarding necessary vaccinations. All animal workers should be up to date with respect to tetanus vaccination. Table 12-3 lists vaccines to consider for particular groups of workers.

Such training should be provided by an individual familiar with the risks of a particular workplace and the safety policies in place, such as a safety officer. Training should be documented. Follow-up training in health and safety can take place on a regular basis with animal workers to identify and mitigate hazards, address institutional occupational health policies (including record keeping), address personal hygiene, provide points of contact for more information or for when to seek medical attention for work-related problems, review unit inspection standards, and evaluate future training needs.",

Consult with local infectious disease specialists, public health authorities, and other resources for appropriate management. accidents and occupational disease was almost three times as great as that of general medical practitioners and their staff, and the rate of severe accidents resulting in lost work time was nine times greater. The most common occupational diseases reported were skin disorders (39%), followed by allergic respiratory diseases (31%) and infectious diseases (19%). 46 In the United States federal law requires veterinary practices to implement a workplace plan to comply with OSHA Hazard Communication Standards (http://www.avma.org/ issues/policy/workplace_hazards.asp). It also appears that veterinarians may be held liable for harm if their employees develop a work-related illness such as a zoonotic infection. 47 It is not clear how many workers in veterinary practices receive occupational medicine services from human health care providers or have access to members of the occupational health team, such as industrial hygienists or infection control specialists. Many veterinary offices are located in rural or other areas where shortages of occupational medicine providers exist. 48 The practice director, who is often a veterinarian, or another staff member may have to perform a number of functions such as identifying hazards and designing control strategies. The National Association of State Public Health Veterinarians (NASPHV) has published a compendium of veterinary standard precautions that provides useful practice guidelines as well as a model infection control plan (Figure 12-4) . 41 The veterinarian may need to educate local medical providers to ensure adequate and confidential preplacement screening, medical surveillance, and acute injury/ illness follow-up of veterinary care workers. Having a designated medical provider as well as a designated emergency medical care facility that is aware of the special exposures of the veterinary workers can help ensure improved preventive and acute care of exposure-related health problems.",

Recommended work practice controls include training new employees in practices such as hand hygiene before and after each patient encounter and after contact with body fluids, secretions, or excretions as well as after eating, drinking, smoking, using lavatories, and cleaning animal areas. Additional work practices include bite prevention and avoidance of needlesticks by not recapping needles. Bite prevention could include physical or chemical restraints, muzzles, and bite-resistant gloves. Personal protective equipment recommendations include gloves or sleeves and facial protection with a mask or goggles when splashes or sprays are expected. An N-95 respirator should be worn when evaluating abortions in small ruminants, poultry deaths, sick psittacine birds, and other situations with the risk of aerosolized pathogens. 41 The NASPHV document also recommends that immunocompromised individuals and pregnant workers be counseled about their increased risk of zoonotic disease, especially when working with high-risk animals such as young animals and animals that are parturient, unvaccinated, stray or feral, housed in shelters or crowded conditions, fed raw meat diets, or with parasites; wildlife; reptiles and amphibians; and exotic or nonnative species. 41 Such counseling should ideally be done by a health care professional who is aware of the zoonotic disease risks faced by the worker. For this reason the NASPHV document recommends that all workers inform their health care providers of their work activities, but additional direct communication between a health care provider and a veterinarian about disease risks may be advisable. However, as previously mentioned, such communication needs to respect patient privacy and confidentiality of medical information (see Chapter 2).",

Adverse reproductive outcomes, such as spontaneous abortion, have also been reported among workers exposed to these anesthetic agents. 54 Control of anesthetic hazards involves ensuring 100% fresh air and 100% exhausted air for dilution of waste gases and odors in animal rooms, filtering of supplied air prior to recirculation, and institution of a scavenging system for waste anesthetic gases and vapors. This scavenging system should be checked periodically to ensure it is working properly. Air levels of anesthetic gases can also be monitored periodically. 55 ",

If workers use respirators, repeat medical evaluations may be required under the OSHA Respiratory Protection standard if a change occurs in workplace conditions. NASPHV also recommends that veterinary personnel who have a change in their health status, such as pregnancy, should discuss their work exposures with their medical providers.

As with other animal workers, it is ideal that the health care provider treating veterinary workers for acute work-related injuries and illnesses be familiar with the hazards in the workplace.

This group of Asiatic monkeys includes rhesus macaques, pigtailed macaques, and cynomolgus monkeys. Human beings who work with these monkeys can be infected by bites, scratches, needlesticks, and mucocutaneous exposure. 65 In monkeys herpes B can be subclinical or cause lesions on the oral mucosa. In human beings herpes B can result in fatal encephalomyelitis. Although rare, death has been reported in up to 80% of cases. Workers dealing with these nonhuman primates must be informed of the risk of herpes B infection and receive training in proper use of appropriate personal protective equipment, including gowns, gloves, masks, and face shields and the maintenance of a safe workplace. They should seek medical care immediately if an exposure occurs because early prophylaxis with antiviral agents has resulted in favorable outcomes. 66 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has developed guidelines for assessment and medical management of monkey scratches and bites, wound contaminations, cage scratches, and other potential exposures. 67 Simian Retroviruses. A number of simian retroviruses, including simian immunodeficiency virus and simian foamy virus, are found in a variety of nonhuman primates. Cases of transmission of these viruses to laboratory workers with nonhuman primate exposure have been reported. Prevention is similar to that for herpes B infection. 68 Measles. Measles (rubeola), a paramyxovirus infection, is primarily a disease of human beings. The primary concern for laboratory animal workers is therefore reverse zoonosis (anthropozoonosis) when working with nonhuman primates because measles can cause lethal infection in these animals. Outbreaks of measles in captive nonhuman primates usually originate from an infectious human animal handler. 69 Therefore animal workers with contact with nonhuman primates must have documented measles vaccination and receive booster vaccinations if necessary. Viral Hepatitis. Hepatitis A, B, and C are primarily viral diseases of human beings. However, chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates have been experimentally infected. 70 Therefore there is risk of reverse zoonosis. Workers in animal facilities who have direct contact with nonhuman primates should be immunized against hepatitis A and B, 64 have baseline serology for protective hepatitis B antibodies (HbSAb), and consider having baseline serology for hepatitis C.",

New employees who have not had a TB skin test in the previous 5 years should be tested with a two-step technique (retesting after 1 week if the first test is negative) to detect boosted immunity from previous infection. Alternative testing methods include an assay for interferon specific to TB (see Chapter 9) . 71 Workers with positive TB tests should be evaluated medically. Such evaluation may include a chest radiograph to exclude active disease and a determination of the need for treatment with antituberculous medication. 72 Rat-Bite Fever (Streptobacillosis).

Depending on the zoo, the diversity of species may far exceed that encountered by most other animal workers. Workers are employed in only one area of the zoo or aquarium, and therefore their occupational health needs may differ widely. Although the animals in a particular collection are likely captive bred, some have originated in the wild, where potential for zoonotic infections could be greater. Many zoos and aquariums are also open to the outdoor environment, allowing contact between wild animals and the captive specimens, with the possibility of disease introduction. For example, outbreaks of highly pathogenic animal influenza (HPAI) have been reported in captive birds in zoos after contact with wild birds. Cases of avian influenza have also occurred in captive felids, presumably as a result of feeding on infected poultry carcasses. Both of these introductions posed infectious risks to zoo workers. For these reasons, zoo workers (as well as zoo animals) may serve as sentinels of emerging infectious disease threats. For example, primate workers in zoos have been found to have evidence of possible infection with simian viruses considered to have potential for emergence. 76 A special issue with zoo and aquarium workers is the significant number of volunteers working in many facilities who may not receive medical screening or prophylactic vaccinations.",

If individuals have contact with rodents in a hantavirus-endemic area, they should undergo respirator medical clearance and respirator fit testing as required under the OSHA respirator standard. Serum banking should be considered for individuals at high risk of zoonotic disease exposure. Immunizations should include tetanus prophylaxis as well as vaccine rabies for individuals working with bats, raccoons, skunks, or other potentially rabid animals. Personal protective equipment should include respirators (Figure 12 -6) and gloves for working with rodents in hantavirus-endemic areas. In other areas, gloves and masks are advisable when handling rodents. Hunters should use adequate hearing protection while hunting and impermeable gloves while preparing carcasses.",
