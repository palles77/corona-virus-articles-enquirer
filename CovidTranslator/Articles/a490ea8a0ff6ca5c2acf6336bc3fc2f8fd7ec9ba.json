After 6 h, DBTmACE2 cells were either direct transfected with small RNA mimics or infected with SARS-CoV-MA15 wt (MOI 1). For direct transfection, 25 nM of small RNA mimics (miScript miRNA mimic, Qiagen) of svRNAs (Table 1 ) and cellular miR-877-5p used as positive controls, were transfected by using 1.5 \u00b5l of TransIT-X2 (Mirus Bio LLC) as described above. For sequence-specific inhibition of small RNA function, 75 nM of synthetic single stranded, 2-OMe modified, RNA oligonucleotides (miScript miRNA Inhibitor, Qiagen) perfectly complementary to each svRNA or miR-877-5p were also transfected as described above. After 18 h, the growth medium was removed and cells were lysed using Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Firefly luciferase activity and red fluorescence from Red Fluorescence Protein (RFP) were measured using Tecan INFINITE F200 Microplate Fluorescence Reader (Gain 100 for RFP and 2 s pre-measurement delay, followed by 10 s measured period for Light Units). The relative luciferase activity was calculated as the ratio of Firefly luciferase activity to the red fluorescence of RFP, used to normalize to the transfection efficiency. The normalized luciferase activity of cells transfected with each pMirTarget plasmid in the absence of small RNA mimics was set to 100%, whereas the luciferase activity of cells either transfected with RNA mimics and RNA inhibitors or infected was expressed as the percentage of that obtained in the absence of RNA mimics.",
