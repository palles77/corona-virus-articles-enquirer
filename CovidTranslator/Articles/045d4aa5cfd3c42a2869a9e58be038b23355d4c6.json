For example, X-ray crystallographic and NMR spectroscopic techniques have been employed to determine binding modes between carbohydrates and proteins. Surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) can provide information on the binding affinities of carbohydrates to proteins. Many wellestablished immunochemical methods have been applied to determine the specificity and cross-reactivity of carbohydrate-antibody and carbohydrate-lectin interactions. These classical approaches were, however, designed to monitor carbohydrate-based molecular recognition on a one-by-one basis and have limited analytical power or throughput in practical applications.",

In spite of their technological differences, these carbohydrate microarrays are all solid-phase binding assays for carbohydrates and their interactions with other biological molecules. They share a number of common characteristics and technical advantages. First, they contain the capacity to display a large panel of carbohydrates in a limited chip space. Second, each carbohydrate is spotted in an amount that is drastically smaller than that required for a conventional molecular or immunological assay. Thus, the bioarray platform makes an effective use of carbohydrate substances. Third, they have high detection sensitivity. The microarray-based assays have higher detection sensitivity than most conventional molecular and immunological assays. This was attributed to the fact that the binding of a molecule in solution phase to an immobilized microspot of ligand in the solid phase has minimal reduction of the molar 360 X. Zhou et al.",

Carbohydrate microarrays constructed by various methods may differ in their technical features and suitability for a given practical application. Some platforms may be applied complementarily to solve biological questions. The method of nitrocellulose-based immobilization of carbohydrate-containing macromolecules, including polysaccharides, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, is suitable for the high-throughput construction of carbohydrate antigen microarrays ( 25 , 6 2 , 6 3 , 67 , 6 8 ) . This platform of carbohydrat e m icroarrays is readily applicable for the large-scale immunological characterization of carbohydrate antigens and anti-carbohydrate antibodies. It is also useful for the initial screening of carbohydrate-binding proteins, such as those newly identified by the human genome project with preserved carbohydrate-binding domains and are predicted to have carbohydrate-binding properties. However, the detection specificity of this carbohydrate microarray would be at the level of a carbohydrate antigen, not a glycoepitope, if the native carbohydrate antigens were spotted. This is owing to the fact that many carbohydrate antigens display multiple antigenic determinants or glycoepitopes. Examining the finer details of the binding properties would require the use of microarrays of defined oligosaccharide sequences. Oligosaccharide array-based binding assays can be applied, in combination with saccharide competition assays, to decipher precise saccharide components of a specific antigenic determinant or glycoepitope (25, 64) .",

Since the horse antisera has no reactivity toward agalacto-orosomucoid (AGOR), which lacks galactose in the upper stream nonreducing ends, the glycoepitopes with terminal galactose may contribute significantly to the antigenic reactivity of SARS-CoV. This glycan array finding gave an important lead in terms of identifying appropriate immunological probes to further characterize the glycoepitopes expressed by SARS-CoV. A microarray containing a panel of galactose-containing complex carbohydrates was created to scan for immunological probes specific for the ASOR-glycans. The lectin PHA-L was shown to be highly specific for the spotted ASOR preparation. The latter is known to be specific for the glycoepitopes that are composed of tri-antennary Galb1-4GlcNAc (Tri-II) or multiantennary Galb1-4GlcNAc (m-II) (see Fig. 1 for an asialo-Tri-II structure of N-glycans) (72) . With this specific probe, the authors characterized SARS-CoV-infected and -uninfected cells. PHA-L was found to stain cells infected with SARS-CoV and this reactivity could be inhibited by ASOR but not AGOR. The authors concluded, therefore, that the glycoepitopes Tri-II or m-II of ASOR are highly expressed by SARS-CoVinfected cells.",

Thus, the human immune system is generally nonresponsive to these \"self\" carbohydrate structures.

The microarray could also be used to probe the effect of charge, size, sulfation, fucosylation, and sialylation on the binding specificity. The binding specificity between two previous pandemic strains of HA, 18NY and 18SC, could be distinguished by the microarray since the 18NY recognizes both a2-6 and a2-3 linkages whereas 18SC recognizes only a2-6 linkages. Only two mutations are required to make the avian strain sufficiently virulent toward humans.

B. anthracis, the etiological agent of anthrax infection, is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium. The most lethal form of human anthrax is the pulmonary infection caused by inhaled spores. In view of the risk of B. anthracis spores as a biological weapon of mass destruction (WMD) (69) , it is necessary to achieve the capacity for the rapid and specific detection of B. anthracis spores in various conditions (41, 71) . It is also important to develop new vaccines to block the anthrax infection at its initial stage before spore germination takes place (11, 60) . In this context, identification of highly specific immunogenic targets that are displayed on the outermost surfaces of B. anthracis spores is of utmost importance. A photogenerated oligosaccharide array was introduced to facilitate identification and characterization of anthrax spore-specific immunogenic carbohydrate moieties (64). In essence, the authors utilized a photoactive surface on glass substrates for covalent immobilization and micropatterning of carbohydrates (7) . They then applied this glycan array to probe specific antibodies that were elicited by immunizations using anthrax spores. The authors assumed that if B. anthracis spores express potent immunogenic carbohydrate moieties, immunization with the spores would elicit antibodies specific for these sugar structures. Such antibody reactivities would then be detected by glycan arrays that display the corresponding sugar structures. A schematic overview of this biomarker identification strategy is shown in Fig. 2 .",

In order to examine whether desired glycoepitopes or antigenic determinants are preserved after immobilization, the authors stained the microarrays using well-characterized monoclonal antidextran antibodies. These include antibodies bearing either the groove-type or the cavity-type antibody-combining sites (10, 65 ) . The form er recogni zes the internal linear chain of a (1,6)dextrans; while the latter is specific for the terminal nonreducing end structure of the polysaccharide.

The molecular forces for the carbohydrate-nitrocellulose interaction remain to be characterized, but it has been suggested that the three-dimensional (3D) microporous configuration of the nitrocellulose on the slides and the macropolymer characteristics of polysaccharides play important roles for the stable immobilization of many polysaccharides on the nitrocellulose surface.

This result suggests that methyl-a-mannoside could not be immobilized on the glass surface. Probing the microarrays with the two other lectins also gave the expected results: Lotus tetragonolobus bound to the spots presenting a-fucose (Fig. 5B) , whereas Erythrina cristagalli bound only to spots presenting lactose and galactose (Fig. 5C ). Nonspecific adsorption was not observed on the spots arrayed with cellobiose and rhamnose and essentially no fluorescence was obtained from surfaces without carbohydrates. The weak signal obtained from the glucose spots when the microarray was probed with L. tetragonolobus may be caused by the weak crossreaction of the lectin L. tetragonolobus. However, this weak cross-interaction that gave less than 8% of signal compared with the specific interaction would not affect the rapid determination of the presence or absence of specific carbohydrate epitopes. Overall, these results demonstrated that the binding of lectins with the prepared carbohydrate microarrays are specific and multiple-analytic characterization can be achieved on the aminooxyacetyl-functionalized slide with good selectivity. Furthermore, periodate oxidation of the immobilized oligosaccharides with NaIO 4 resulted in the loss of lectin binding. These experiments verify that the fabricated carbohydrate microarray is well suited for the selective identification of carbohydrate-binding proteins. Figure 6 shows the dose-response curves of lectins applied to the fabricated oligosaccharide microarrays. It was apparent that an increase in lectin concentration resulted in a corresponding increase in the fluorescence emitted from the arrayed spots, and saturation of affinities was obtained at high concentration. The calculated limit of detection (LOD, the concentration which gives a fluorescent signal higher than the background\u00fethree standard deviation units) was determined to be approximately 0.008 mg/ml for Con A, which is lower than the microtiter plate assay developed by Hatakeyama. Carbohydrate arrays have the characteristics required for quantitative assays of multiple protein-carbohydrate interactions with minimal quantities of reagents. To assess the utilization of carbohydrate microarrays fabricated on aminooxyacetyl-functionalized slides for quantitative assays, a-methyl mannose was applied to inhibit Con A binding to the immobilized mannose spots. A series of mixtures containing biotin-labeled Con A (2 mM in PBST) and a-methyl mannose (0-4 mM in PBST) was applied on the microarray surface and incubated for 1 h at 25 C. The substrates were rinsed with PBST, stained with 5 mg/ml of Cy3-streptavidin, and analyzed with a fluorescence scanner to quantify the amount of bound Con A on the spots of mannose and glucose. The amount of lectin that bound to the chips for each concentration of soluble ligand (i.e., a-methyl mannose) is shown in Fig. 7 . The IC 50 (concentration of inhibitor required to prevent 50% of lectin binding to array spot) was determined using a-methyl mannose as an inhibitor of Con A binding to glucose and mannose. The results verified that the microarray spots of mannose (IC 50 \u00bc60 mM) competed more effectively with the soluble carbohydrate for Con A than that of glucose (IC 50 \u00bc23 mM). The relative binding affinities of these carbohydrates for Con A is consistent with those obtained in previous studies (31) .",

Upon exposure to UV light, the photoactive aromatic carbonyls presumably react with the C-H groups of the sugars by hydrogen abstraction followed by radical recombination to form a covalent bond (Fig. 8) . Immobilization of unmodified carbohydrates by this approach was demonstrated to be much less dependent on the MWs of the spotted carbohydrates compared to a nitrocellulose-coated slide. Furthermore, for oligosaccharides the grafting efficiency was shown to be much higher than nitrocellulose. However, the method of photocoupling, which is expected to target any CH-group on the sugar rings with varying specificity depending on the structure of the ring, may interfere with the protein-binding specificity of monosaccharides. Wang et al. recently used this approach to generate a glycan array containing a large panel of synthetic carbohydrates and characterized their antigenic reactivities with pathogen-specific antibodies (64). As described in Section I, this investigation led to the discovery of a highly specific carbohydrate moiety of B. anthracis spores. Another type of photoactive microarray platform, based on dextran-coated glass slides (PhotoChips from CSEM, Switzerland) was reported by Sprenger's group (2) . The dextran-based polymer OptoDex is functionalized with aryl-trifluoromethyldiazirine groups. On illumination, aryl-trifluoromethyl-diazirine groups form reactive carbenes, which can undergo a variety of reactions with a vicinal molecule that result in covalent bond formation including insertion into s and p bonds, addition of a nucleophile or electrophile and hydrogen abstraction. The authors have demonstrated that this substrate immobilizes polysaccharides and glycoligands. However, since the aryl-trifluoromethyl-diazirine-functionalized surface can react with any type of biomolecule, this type of array substrate is not suitable for preparing carbohydrate microarrays with unpurified carbohydrate extractions from cells or plants. Precaution must be made when applying this platform for serological studies since antidextran natural antibodies are frequently detected in human circulation (33, 67) .",

These methods are especially useful when working with complex oligosaccharides isolated from natural sources and when derivatized carbohydrates are not available. In many cases, the glycoepitopes contained in these microarrays are reactive toward appropriate antibodies, lectins, or other carbohydrate-binding partners of defined carbohydrate-binding specificities. However, these methods of saccharide immobilization are not expected to be site specific. Instead, the carbohydrates are attached without control of the orientation of saccharide display. A given saccharide spotted may, thus, present a glycoepitope in a spectrum of different configurations, although one or a few might be predominant. Thus, in order to further characterize the fine specificity of carbohydrate binding, especially the orientation effect of epitope display, one may want to explore the technologies described in the subsequent sections.

The oligosaccharide probe can be modified with a tag or coupled to a larger carrier molecule for noncovalent immobilization. A research group led by Feizi has developed oligosaccharide microarrays by noncovalently immobilizing NGLs on nitrocellulose (25, 44) . The oligosaccharides were obtained by chemical or enzymatic methods by using glycoproteins, glycolipids, proteoglycans, polysaccharides, or whole organs, or from chemical synthesis. The chemical derivatives of the oligosaccharides were synthesized by reductive Carbohydrate Microarrays as Essential Tools amination of the oligosaccharides to the amino phospholipid 1,2-dihexadecylsn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine or its anthracene-containing fluorescent analogue. The immobilization efficiency of the NGLs on nitrocellulose was found to be high irrespective of the size of carbohydrates. The carbohydrate-binding proteins were investigated with known monoclonal antibodies, the E-and L-selectins, a chemokine (RANTES), and a cytokine. Binding was detected by colorimetric ELISA-type methods. It was shown that carbohydrate-binding proteins could single out their ligands, not only in arrays of homogeneous, structurally defined oligosaccharides but also in an array of heterogeneous O-glycan fractions derived from brain glycoproteins. The unique feature of this carbohydrate microarray technology is that deconvolution strategies are included with mass spectrometry for further determining the sequences of ligand-positive components within mixtures.",

The fabricated glycan microarray has shown utility for profiling the specificity of a diverse range of glycan-binding proteins, including C-type lectins, siglecs, galectins, anti-carbohydrate antibodies, lectins from plants and microbes, and intact viruses. A microarray substrate for covalent immobilization of aminophenyl-derivatized carbohydrates is commercially available (GlycoChip, Glycominds, Lod, Israel). This substrate is functionalized with an oligomer of 1,8-diamino-3,6-dioxaoctan. Schwarz et al. reported the application of this substrate to fabricate oligosaccharide microarrays by using p-aminophenyl-derivatized carbohydrates via a cyanurchloride-activated linker (50) . This approach allows the covalent attachment of glycans containing a terminal aliphatic amine by forming an amide bond under aqueous conditions at room temperature. The fabricated oligosaccharide microarray was used to analyze the glycan-binding antibody repertoire in a pool of affinity-purified IgG collected from a healthy human population. In addition, a novel anti-cellulose antibody was detected that binds specifically to b4-linked saccharides with a preference for glucopyranose over galactopyranose residues with the oligosaccharide microarray.",

The glass slide surface was first functionalized with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers bearing 64-aminofunctional groups with the purpose of maximizing potential reactive sites on the surface. The amino groups of the PAMAM-modified slide were then converted to terminal carboxylic acid groups by reacting with glutaric anhydride. The carboxylic acid of the dendrimer film was finally converted to a phosphane group by reacting with the 2-(diphenylphosphinyl)phenol. The phosphane group has a high reactive efficiency to azide-derivatized molecules. The azide-derivatized carbohydrate moieties were prepared by solid-phase Figure 12 Carbohydrate microarrays prepared by covalent immobilization of cyclopentadiene-derivatized carbohydrates to a benzoquinone-functionalized substrate. synthesis using a safety-catch linker strategy. The azide-derivatized carbohydrates were found to be efficiently immobilized onto the phosphane-functionalized slide surface. A spot volume of a 0.25 nl sample arrayed on the phosphane-functionalized slide surface produced a spot size of 400 mM in diameter. A mannose-containing carbohydrate microarray was fabricated on this substrate. Carbohydrate-protein interactions were evaluated by incubating with Alexa647-labeled Con A. This shows that the immobilization of azide-derivatized carbohydrates via the Staudinger reaction is highly efficient and can be employed to detect biomolecular interactions.",

Immobilization of amino-derivatized oligosaccharides was achieved by the formation of a covalent bond between the amino group and the growing polymer chain during photo-initiated polymerization in the presence of a cross-linking agent. The authors have demonstrated that a hydrogel carbohydrate microarray contains three different classes of glycomolecules, which are as follows: (i) oligosaccharide derivatives bearing a primary amino group, (ii) oligosaccharide-polyacrylamide conjugates bearing allyl groups, and (iii) oligosaccharide derivatives bearing 2-aminopyridine groups. All of the three types of oligosaccharide derivatives are readily subjected to covalent attachment in the same conditions during the radical process of gel formation. For hydrogel microarray manufacturing, the gel-forming monomers, that is, methacrylamide, methylenebisacrylamide, and oligosaccharide derivatives are printed onto hydrophobized glass and irradiated with UV light. The double bond of methylenebisacrylamide readily reacts with the amino group of the oligosaccharide derivatives at pH 10.5 giving rise to a Michael addition product. After polymerization, an array of individual 3D approximately 1-nl gel drops, 150 mm in diameter, and 25 mm in height was formed. The authors have shown that the 3D hydrogel provides high sensitivity in probing proteins due to the large amount of carbohydrates immobilized in the 3D hydrogel spots.",

Technical issues that require immediate attention may include but are not limited to optimization of existing technologies for array construction, quality control, and technical standardization in both microarray production and application, establishment of specialized bioinformatic tools to handle the massive amount of carbohydrate microarray data, and to effectively extract diagnostic or research information from each microarray assay. Taking care of these issues would facilitate biological and medical applications of carbohydrate microarrays. Exploring the repertoires of glycoepitopes and their receptors represents a long-term goal of carbohydrate research. How big is the repertoire of glycoepitopes? Addressing this question is one of the most important topics in the postgenomics era. It was estimated that there are about 500 endogenous glycoepitopes in mammals (17) . However, this estimation did not consider the repertoires of the \"hybrid\" structures that are generated by protein posttranslational modification, including both N-and O-glycosylation. Furthermore, the conformational diversity of carbohydrates and microheterogeneity of carbohydrate chains substantially increases the repertoire of carbohydrate-based antigenic determinants or glycoepitopes (39, 63, 66) . Considering carbohydrate structures of the microbial world, which are directly relevant to medicine, the sizes and diversity of the repertoires of glycoepitopes are unpredictable. Establishment of high-throughput platforms of carbohydrate microarrays provides powerful means to facilitate the identification and characterization of carbohydrate-based pathogen signatures and other biomarkers.",

These biomolecules are critical for defining glycoepitopes and are useful for detection of glycoepitopes in living organisms. Thus, using specific immunological probes to characterize glycoepitopes is equally important to the structural determination of glycoepitopes. Similar effort has been successfully made for protein-based biomarkers. A notable example is the establishment of a large collection of monoclonal antibodies for cell differentiation antigens (CD antigens). Availability of specific probes for CD antigens, in combination with the state-ofthe-art technologies of flow cytometry (Hi-D FACS) (59), has revolutionized research in cellular biology and immunology and medical applications of CD antigens, especially in the clinical diagnosis of leukemia and other human diseases. Exploring the repertoires of glycoepitopes and their cellular receptors, with the aid of carbohydrate microarray technologies and specific immunological probes, represents one of the highly active areas of postgenomics research that may last for a few decades and likely accompanied with a fruitful outcome.",

Zhou et al. stability of the oxime linkage and hydrazide linkage for oligosaccharides up to pH 9. However, reactions of aminooxy or hydrazide groups with free carbohydrates are slow when the carbohydrate MW increases because of the reducing activity of the aldehyde group of the carbohydrates. To improve the immobilization of larger carbohydrates, such as polysaccharides, on the aminooxy-and hydrazidefunctionalized slide substrates, Zhou et al. have been investigating the utilization of microwave radiation energy to facilitate the fabrication of carbohydrate microarrays on a 3D polymer film bearing aminooxy-and hydrazide-functional groups (Zhou X., personal communication). Using microwave radiation to facilitate the reaction, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides can be covalently linked on the aminooxy-and hydrazide-functionalized surface within minutes.",
