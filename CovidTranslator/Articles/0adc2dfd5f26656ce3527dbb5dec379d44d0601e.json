Bacteria were responsible for 82 (46%) infections, most commonly bacteremias due to Staphylococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, and Enterobacteriaceae. Of 11 invasive fungal infections, 9 were aspergillosis, 4 of which were fatal. Overall mortality was 56% in the first year. Thirteen deaths were from infection; 11 occurred in the first 100 days and 7 in the first 30 days post-UCBT. Of 10 patients who never engrafted, 9 died, 6 from infection, within 100 days post-UCBT.",

The use of UCB cells has been mostly studied in children with hematological malignancies, but it has extended to the adult population because of the paucity of related or matched donors [1, 2] . Advantages to using UCB cells for HCT include the ability to use human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched cells without significant adverse effects on graft function and the decreased incidence of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after transplantation [1, 3] . However, both the decreased quantity of cells available for transplantation and the immunological immaturity of UCB cells have been linked to delayed engraftment after UCB transplant (UCBT) [3, 4] .",

The clinical significance of asymptomatic HHV-6 viremia remains controversial; however, HHV-6 reactivation has been independently associated with graft failure after UCBT [25] . We did not find a significant relationship between HHV-6 and graft failure in our patients. With the onset of viremia, patients were treated with foscarnet, and this may have blocked the development of end-organ disease due to HHV-6. Human herpesvirus 6 was responsible for the death of 1 patient, who developed limbic encephalitis more than 100 days after UCBT; this patient had been previously treated with foscarnet for 2 episodes of HHV-6 viremia, 1 of which was accompanied by pneumonitis. Receipt of an UCBT has been described previously as a risk factor for the development of limbic encephalitis; this condition is associated with high plasma HHV-6 viral loads, which were observed in this patient [26] .",

Acyclovir resistance was confirmed in 1 patient who died of disseminated HSV-1 infection. Acyclovir resistance appears to be more common after HCT, particularly in the setting of T-cell depletion, and may be related to prolonged use of acyclovir for prophylaxis [27, 28] . None of our patients were on high-dose acyclovir, which is used at some centers for antiviral prophylaxis after HCT; this raises the question of whether this prophylaxis strategy might have prevented these fatal herpesvirus infections [29] .",
