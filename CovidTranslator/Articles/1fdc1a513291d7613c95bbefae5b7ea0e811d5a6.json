The presumptive cause of CHF is ventricular diastolic dysfunction, because most cats with HCM have a normal to hyperdynamic LV ejection fraction. \u2022 Diastolic dysfunction is the inability to fill the left ventricle with normal LA pressures. \u2022 Early diastolic dysfunction is characterized by abnormal myocardial relaxation with a vigorous LA contraction to support late diastolic filling. This situation is associated with the atrial (S4) gallop so often detected in these cats. \u2022 Progressive ventricular disease is associated with reduced chamber compliance with loss of passive LV ventricular distensibility. Tissue injury and fibrosis increase myocardial and chamber stiffness, requiring elevated LA filling pressures. This creates a situation of rapid early diastolic filling that becomes restricted as the stiff ventricle is distended. This correlates to a ventricular (S3) or summation (S3+4) gallop. \u2022 As the left atrium distends, a loss of atrial contractility may develop. This reduces filling effectiveness and also predisposes to stagnant flow, formation of atrial thrombi, and atrial fibrillation. \u2022 The roles of myocardial ischemia, infarction, and neurohormonal activation in the pathogenesis of progressive tissue injury and cardiac dysfunction are possible therapeutic targets because b-blockers and angiotensin system inhibitors blunt these detrimental responses. \u2022 Demand ischemia-the sudden increase in myocardial oxygen demand that outstrips coronary blood supply-may contribute to the sudden development of left-sided CHF (flash pulmonary edema) so often observed in stressed cats with HCM. Ischemia impairs myocardial filling and contraction. For this reason, drugs with anti-ischemic effects (atenolol, diltiazem) are often prescribed in this disease. \u2022 Systolic abnormalities are identified in some cats with HCM. These include subtle abnormalities detected only by tissue Doppler echocardiography; identification of apical or free wall-infarcts; regional wall motion abnormalities; or rarely, a global loss of LV systolic function. \u2022 Dynamic and labile pressure gradients between the LV and aorta are often identified during ejection across the LV outflow tract. In most cases, systolic gradients stem from either septal and papillary muscle hypertrophy (midventricular obstruction) or systolic anterior motion (SAM) of the mitral valve causing mitral septal contact. These abnormalities can be documented on high-quality echocardiographic studies. The presence of significant SAM is invariably associated with an eccentric jet of mitral regurgitation (MR), readily seen by color Doppler examination. \u2022 Some chronic cases of HCM appear to evolve into a restrictive form of cardiomyopathy with either regional wall dysfunction (suggestive of myocardial infarction) or globally reduced LV systolic function (suggesting fibrosis or ischemia). Rarely, a cat will progress to a grossly dilated form of disease.",

LV hypertrophy usually decreases except in the cat with concurrent diseases of uncontrolled hypertension or with primary (idiopathic) HCM. Hypertension may improve or resolve as cardiac output decreases with reduction of thyroid concentration; however, other causes of hypertension may endure (especially primary renal disease), requiring medical management with amlodipine. Sinus tachycardia and premature beats usually resolve with initiation of anti-thyroid medication (methimazole, Tapazole). Persistent tachycardia may indicate concurrent CHF or a need for lowdoses of a beta-blocker (atenolol, 1 / 4 of a 25-mg tablet PO, once or twice daily). \u2022 In a small percentage of cats, the cardiac effects of hyperthyroidism are manifested in a more clinically significant manner.

Re-examination of the patient may indicate prominent jugular pulses or overt jugular venous distension, compatible with plasma volume expansion and heart disease. In advanced hyperthyroidism, there can be sufficient cardiac dysfunction and volume expansion to cause more generalized cardiomegaly. Echocardiography often shows biatrial dilatation with normal or even reduced LV shortening fraction despite thickened LV wall measures. Affected cats should be evaluated for concurrent hypertension, anemia, or renal failure. Great care must be taken when administering fluid therapy as large pleural effusions may occur. Thoracocentesis may be needed. In cats with advanced cardiac disease, anti-thyroid medication should be initiated without delay; beta-blockers avoided to prevent cardiac depression; and an ACEI prescribed for cardiac protection, control of incipient (or overt) CHF, and for antihypertensive effects. \u2022 Therapy of hyperthyroid heart disease is predicated on controlling the underlying disorder and is discussed in Chapter 31.

            "text": "\u2022 Therapy with Atenolol-b-blockers are recommended in the management of HCM with moderate to severe LV outflow tract obstruction. Atenolol is most often prescribed for this purpose as it is a twice daily drug (compared to tid propranolol). The usual starting dose of atenolol is 1 / 4 of a 25-mg tablet PO for 3 days and thereafter 1 / 4 tablet PO q12h. Dosage is adjusted to achieve an examination heart rate of 120 to 160/min. Typically cats receive 1 / 2 tablet in the AM and either 1 / 4 or 1 / 2 tablet in the PM. \u2022 Atenolol effectively reduces LVOT gradients and consistently slows the heart during times of stress (for example, a veterinary examination). \u2022 Cardiac benefits of beta-blockers in cats with HCM include preventing sinus tachycardia, reducing dynamic outflow obstruction, decreasing SAM and attendant mitral regurgitation, and prolonging diastole. Myocardial oxygen demand is reduced through decreases in heart rate, contractility, and blood pressure. \u2022 Unfortunately, the net effect of beta-blockade on diastolic function in cats with HCM is unknown (see \"Cardiovascular Drugs\" for a discussion). \u2022 Beta-blockade is especially helpful for reducing pressure gradients caused by dynamic LV outflow obstruction in cats with HCM. The murmur of mitral regurgitation generally becomes softer following beta-blockade, and the peak outflow tract velocity is substantially reduced in the majority of cats given an adequate dose of atenolol. In a small European study, another beta-blocker (propranolol), was associated with regression of LV hypertrophy, but this finding is inconsistent, and should not be expected. \u2022 Beta-blockers are contraindicated in cats with overt hypotension, bradycardia, uncontrolled pulmonary edema, AV block, or recent arterial thromboembolism (until collateral circulation has been restored); furthermore, their value in cats with recent-onset CHF appears to be unfavorable, based on a recent multicenter study, and should not be routinely prescribed for short-term management of the CHF patient. \u2022 Therapy with Diltiazem-When HCM is characterized by moderate to severe LV hypertrophy without obstruction, and especially when there is concurrent LA dilatation, diltiazem may be a therapeutic consideration. Dosing typically involves a longacting preparation as standard diltiazem dosed at 1 / 4 of a 30-mg tablet PO q8h is simply impractical for most cat owners. Dilacor XR (brand of diltiazem) can be administered at a dosage of 30 mg once or twice daily (open the 240 mg capsule and cut the four 60-mg pills in half). Others have used long-acting diltiazem capsules (Cardizem CD) compounded in a palatable syrup, starting at 30 mg of diltiazem once daily. The bioavailability and dosing regimens of these preparations have been issues. Diltiazem is thought to improve LV relaxation, but the precise mechanism for this benefit has not been elucidated (See \"Cardiovascular Drugs\" for a discussion). \u2022 Overall, diltiazem should reduce myocardial oxygen demand by decreasing contractility, blood pressure, and heart rate (though less effectively than atenolol). \u2022 While diltiazem is a negative inotrope, effects on reducing dynamic outflow tract gradients have been somewhat disappointing at the doses commonly used. \u2022 While the chronic administration of diltiazem has been reported to decrease LV hypertrophy in cats with very severe HCM, it is very uncommon to observe regression, even with prolonged therapy. \u2022 Thus, the main reason to choose diltiazem therapy in cats with HCM is for potential improvement of diastolic function and for prevention or treatment of CHF in HCM. \u2022 Contraindications to administration of diltiazem in cats are uncontrolled CHF, sinus bradycardia, hypotension, and AV block. \u2022 Bradycardia, hypotension, depression, and skin reactions (erythema/edema) have been observed in some cats receiving this drug. Anorexia is a relatively common client complaint. Adverse effects were reported in just over 20% of cats in one clinical report. \u2022 As with atenolol, diltiazem does not appear to have a role in the short-term management of CHF in cats. \u2022 ACEI Therapy-The potential of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) to benefit HCM has not been demonstrated thus far, except in cats with overt CHF. Theoretically ACEI, especially with more 'tissue-sensitive' ACEI (such as ramipril) could prevent progressive myocardial injury or fibrosis in asymptomatic HCM. However, with no firm evidence of benefit, the authors' recommendations are to reserve an ACEI for cases of documented CHF or when moderate to severe LA dilatation is documented by echocardiography (especially in the setting of Doppler evidence of elevated LA pressure).",

While this distinction may seem academic, there is a clear trend to use cardioprotective drugs such as beta-blockers and ACEIs in dogs with occult DCM. Thus, one's perspective on the requirement to demonstrate systolic dysfunction before labeling a patient \"occult\" DCM may influence whether or not early intervention is prescribed. \u2022 Most diagnoses of occult DCM are made after a breeder requests that a cardiologist screen an important dog or following a veterinary examination that uncovers a murmur or arrhythmia.",

These drugs are also potentially cardioprotective if the AF is a premonitory sign of future DCM. For the first three days, the initial dose of the betablocker should be 50% of the prescribed dose, to prevent undue lethargy. Thereafter, the drug dose can be titrated up over 2 to 4 weeks to achieve an appropriate average daily heart rate (generally in the range of 70-80/min). \u2022 Diltiazem therapy for heart rate control-The use of this calcium channel blocker (dosed at 1-2.0 mg/ kg PO q8h) is effective in controlling heart rate but does not confer the \"cardioprotection\" of betablockers should the arrhythmia represent early DCM. An initial dose of 0.6 mg/kg PO q8h for the first day is recommended before increasing the dose. Diltiazem can be used in combination with a beta-blocker. A long-acting preparation of diltiazem can also be used if q8h dosing is difficult (using the same total daily dosage, divided q12h). \u2022 Digoxin therapy-While digoxin can be prescribed for lone AF, cardiac glycosides are less effective for controlling excessive exercise-related rates and are not recommended by us when there is no evidence of heart failure. \u2022 Cardioversion -The conversion of AF back to sinus rhythm is definitely possible in dogs with lone AF. The use of procainamide, sotalol, or amiodarone for this purpose has met with mixed, and generally unfavorable, results. However, electrical DC biphasic cardioversion is highly successful in the setting of lone AF, especially in giant breeds, provided lowdose amiodarone is administered following the",

Principles of Hospital Management of CHF include \u2022 Administer furosemide (2-5 mg/kg IV); follow this with repeated IV or IM injections. Alternatively begin a constant rate infusion of furosemide. \u2022 Provide supplemental oxygen by nasal prongs or other method appropriate for the size of the dog. If oxygen is unavailable, direct a fan to the facial region to minimize dyspnea. \u2022 Administer nitroglycerin ointment topically (1-1.5 inches for a large breed dog q12h). \u2022 Treat life-threatening pulmonary edema with afterload reduction using an infusion of sodium nitroprusside (0.5-2.5 mcg/kg/min is the typical dosage range) with careful attention paid to arterial blood pressure. Titrate the infusion to a systolic value of 90 to 100 mm Hg. A less effective alternative for load reduction is enalapril at 0.25 to 0.5 mg/kg PO q12h. \u2022 Perform thoracocentesis if there is a moderate to large pleural effusion. \u2022 For CHF with systemic hypotension begin an infusion of dobutamine (2.5-10 mcg/kg/min) for 24 to 48 hours. Dobutamine can have benefits beyond the period of infusion. \u2022 In the setting of hypotension, arterial vasodilators such as nitroprusside or an ACEI should be avoided until the pressure is stabilized by dobutamine. \u2022 In dogs with AF, digoxin (0.01mg/kg PO q12h for the first two doses; 0.005 mg/kg PO q12h thereafter) is prescribed to control the ventricular rate response. \u2022 Principles of long-term home management of CHF include \u2022 Furosemide (2-4 mg/kg PO q8-12h) \u2022 Spironolactone (1-2 mg/kg PO once or twice daily) \u2022 Enalapril or benazepril (0.25 mg/kg PO q12h; increase to 0.5 mg/kg PO q12h after the first reevaluation) \u2022 Digoxin (0.003-0.005 mg/kg PO q12h) unless there are contraindications for therapy such as ventricular ectopy or renal failure. \u2022 Pimobendan (Vetmedin, 0.2-0.3 mg/kg PO q12h)if available, generally supplants digoxin except in AF when both drugs are administered. \u2022 A sodium-restricted diet.\u2022 A b-blocker may be considered to blunt the cardiotoxic effects of the sympathetic nervous system; however, heart failure must be well controlled first. Consider carvedilol (Coreg), starting at 0.05 to 0.1 mg/kg PO q12h; up-titrate the dose every 2 to 4 weeks to a target of 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg PO q12h.",

Once this had been done, and if a decision is made to treat the arrhythmia, a long-term plan for management should be established. \u2022 Relative Risk-Clearly the presence of clinical signs (collapse, syncope) is an indication to control ventricular tachycardia if the clinician is certain that a tachyarrhythmia is the basis for the episodes. In most cases, the situation is less clear cut, and the clinician must \"grade\" the arrhythmia in terms of severity. Isolated PVCs or runs of monomorphic, \"slow\" VT (usually <160/min) frequently are not treated. Couplets are not necessarily more dangerous than single PVCs, but closely timed couplets may indicate a higher \"grade\" of arrhythmia. Polymorphic VT (including torsade de pointe); non-sustained but flutter-like runs of VT; long runs of monomorphic, fast VT (exceeding 200/min); frequent multiform PVCs; and PVCs falling on the prior T-waves (R on T) suggest a higher grade or complexity of the arrhythmia. Anti-arrhythmic therapy is usually recommended. When serious arrhythmias are evident on a routine ECG, there is probably no need to perform a Holter ECG until after therapy has begun, especially in the dog with clinical signs. When a routine ECG shows \"low-grade\" arrhythmias such as isolated PVCs or runs of \"slow\" VT, it is reassuring to know if the results of a 24-hour Holter ECG support a low grade of complexity before deciding not to treat. When doubt remains, obtain consultation if possible.M Key Point Decisions about initiating anti-arrhythmic therapy are imperfect, and dogs with recurrent PVCs or VT-whether on or off therapy-always carry a risk for sudden cardiac death. No antiarrhythmic drug has been proven to prevent sudden death in dogs.\u2022 Isolated PVCs-Generally, it is better not to treat isolated PVCs. However, when they are frequent (such as >10,000 per day or about 7 PVCs per minute) they may be difficult to ignore. One well tolerated approach is to prescribe a beta-blocker such as atenolol (0.5-1 mg/kg PO q12h), which will likely reduce the total number of ectopics but not create a pro-arrhythmic situation. \u2022 Ventricular Tachycardia -When treatment is elected, the choice of drug depends largely on personal preference, but some recommendations can be advanced. The Chapter \"Cardiovascular Drugs\" describes the clinical pharmacology, use, and adverse effects of these drugs. Sotalol (1-2 mg/kg PO q12h) is generally well tolerated in dogs and clearly improves Holter ECG recordings in some breeds (such as boxers). This drug should not be used in German shepherds with inherited ventricular ectopy. Mexiletine-An oral drug related to lidocaine, mexiletine (Mexitil) is an effective ventricular antiarrhythmic in many dogs (5-8 mg/kg PO q8h). We combine it with a b-blocker such as propranolol (0.5-1 mg/kg PO q8h) or atenolol (0.5-1 mg/kg PO q12h). Anorexia, tremors, and vomiting are adverse effects. For unresponsive patients, sotalol (1 mg/kg PO q12h) can be substituted for the other beta-blocker. Amiodarone (Cordarone) is an effective drug for VT, but may be more pro-arrhythmic and carries a higher incidence of adverse effects than sotalol. With a long elimination half-life, a loading dose is used initially (5-10 mg/kg PO q12h) followed by a lower maintenance dose (4-6 mg/kg PO once daily). Procainamide -The use of a long-acting procainamide preparation (15-20 mg/kg PO q8h) is recommended as procainamide HCl has a very short elimination half-life in dogs. As with mexiletine, it may be more effective when combined with a beta-blocker.",
