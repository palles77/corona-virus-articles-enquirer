Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of RNA structure would inform a broader understanding of RNA biology and facilitate exploiting RNA as a biotechnological tool and therapeutic target. Determining the pattern of base pairing, or secondary structure, of RNA is a first step in these endeavors. Advances in experimental, computational, and comparative analysis approaches for analyzing secondary structure have yielded accurate structures for many small RNAs, but only a few large (>500 nts) RNAs. In addition, most current methods for determining a secondary structure require considerable effort, analytical expertise, and technical ingenuity. In this review, we outline an efficient strategy for developing accurate secondary structure models for RNAs of arbitrary length. This approach melds structural information obtained using SHAPE chemistry with structure prediction using nearest-neighbor rules and the dynamic programming algorithm implemented in the RNAstructure program. Prediction accuracies reach \u226595% for RNAs on the kilobase scale. This approach facilitates both development of new models and refinement of existing RNA structure models, which we illustrate using the Gag-Pol frameshift element in an HIV-1 M-group genome. Most promisingly, integrated experimental and computational refinement brings closer the ultimate goal of efficiently and accurately establishing the secondary structure for any RNA sequence.",

In addition to its classically understood role as the intermediary between genome and proteome, RNA plays direct roles in fundamental cellular processes including biological catalysis, gene regulation and host defense. RNA also serves as the genome for many viruses. All of these functions depend on, or are modulated by, the ability of RNA to fold into higher order structures.

However, only limited sets of RNAs are candidates for current high resolution crystallography and NMR approaches. A simpler problem is to determine the base pairing pattern (termed the secondary structure) of an RNA. Secondary structure determination, independent of higher order structural information, is possible because the hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions that collectively form secondary structure are usually stronger than tertiary interactions [1] [2] [3] [4] , and because RNA folding is often hierarchical [5, 6] , with many secondary structural motifs forming prior to tertiary contacts. Additionally, knowledge of the secondary structure greatly restricts possible three-dimensional conformations and facilitates tertiary structure prediction [7] [8] [9] . Moreover, a subset of RNA functions may depend more directly on secondary structural motifs than on global folds.",

Sequence-based folding generally includes two main elements: an energy function based on experimentally derived thermodynamic parameters, and an algorithm that explores the conformational space available to the RNA and ranks computed structures. Most energy functions use the Turner et al. [10, 11] set of nearest neighbor parameters, derived from optical melting experiments. A summary of these parameters is available at the Nearest-Neighbor Database [12] . Exploring conformational space is challenging because of the vast number of possible secondary structures, which is estimated to scale exponentially as ~1.8 N , where N is the number of nucleotides in the RNA [13] . This means that a \"brute force\" approach that samples every possible conformation is impossible both from a computational standpoint and from the perspective of efficient RNA folding in vivo. Consequently, the intrinsic thermodynamics and kinetics of RNA folding must conspire to restrict the folding pathway to a narrow subset of these structures, only one (or perhaps a few) of which is likely to dominate the equilibrium ensemble. Especially for short RNAs, thermodynamic considerations are likely paramount and thus the structure with the lowest free energy is the biologically active one.",

These algorithms are deterministic, meaning that given a defined set of energy rules, they always find the lowest free energy structure. The Zuker algorithm scales as O(N 3 ) in time, where N is the number of nucleotides in the sequence. This means that doubling the sequence length requires eight times as much time to predict the structure. Nevertheless, on modern computers, the time to make a prediction is reasonably fast. The guarantee that the optimal structure can be computed and the relative computational efficiency are made possible, first, by incorporating simplifying assumptions into the energy function, and second, by limiting the types of allowed RNA folds.",

Helix energy terms are sequence-dependent, reflect the energetic bonus of adding a base pair to a helix, and implicitly include both canonical hydrogen bonding and base stacking.

However, comparative sequence analysis cannot be applied to many RNAs of interest because the method requires multiple divergent sequences with a common secondary structure. The sequences must be similar enough to admit a multiple sequence alignment, yet divergent enough to show sufficient variation. Sequences corresponding to open reading frames are especially recalcitrant to analysis because selective pressure at the protein coding level further restricts the degree of variation. Finally, constructing a model from a sequence alignment is an iterative process that requires considerable user effort and skill.",

However, the net improvement gained from using traditional reagents is often modest. First, traditional reagents tend to react with only a subset of nucleotides, so the absence of reactivity cannot usually be taken as evidence for likely base pairing. Second, different reagents are required to react with all four RNA nucleotides and some of the more useful reagents, like dimethyl sulfate (DMS), react at different base functional groups depending on the nucleotide. Third, the dynamic range for many reagents is low, making it difficult to distinguish levels of reactivity beyond a qualitative \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" scale. Finally, while alternative chemistries such as in-line probing [36] and hydroxyl radical footprinting [37] provide valuable insight into higher order structures and react broadly with all four RNA nucleotides, they less directly report the intrinsic nucleotide flexibilities that largely characterize secondary structure. Thus, it is challenging to create quantitative relationships between reagent reactivity and RNA secondary structure.",

SHAPE yields quantitative reactivity information for nearly every nucleotide in an RNA. Advantageously, SHAPE is not limited by RNA size and is remarkably insensitive to solvent accessibility [38, 40, 41] . Additionally, SHAPE can be applied to both in vitro transcripts and also to RNAs from native-like cellular and viral environments. Combining SHAPE information with a thermodynamics-based dynamic programming algorithm, as implemented in RNAstructure [11] , results in highly accurate secondary structure models [30] . This approach has been benchmarked and shown to yield secondary structures for diverse RNAs, including the E. coli 16S rRNA (1542 nucleotides), with >95% accuracy as judged by sensitivity (percentage of known base pairs predicted correctly) and positive predictive value (PPV, percentage of predicted base pairs in the known structure) [30] (Table 1 ). SHAPE has been used to propose experimentally-informed secondary structural models for many RNAs and RNA states whose structures are unlikely to be determinable by covariation or high resolution experimental approaches [30, 39, [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] . In this work, we will briefly review the SHAPE experimental protocol and data processing steps. We will then describe in detail how SHAPE experimental information is incorporated into a nearest neighbor dynamic programming algorithm to create accurate secondary structure models. We close with an analysis of a novel SHAPE-supported model for the HIV-1 frameshift element.",

This reaction occurs more readily with conformationally unconstrained or flexible nucleotides such as those in single stranded regions, loops, or bulges (spheres, Fig. 1B ). Flexible nucleotides react preferentially because they more readily sample conformations conducive to nucleophilic attack. In contrast, nucleotides in highly structured regions are conformationally constrained and less frequently achieve an optimal geometry, making them less reactive towards SHAPE reagents. In general, solvent inaccessible, but unconstrained, nucleotides are still reactive by SHAPE.",

The optimal reagent concentration varies and can be system-specific: too high a concentration of SHAPE reagent results in significant signal decay and reduced read lengths, while too low a concentration yields data with a poor signal. Background signals in the primer extension reaction are measured by performing a no-reagent control in which DMSO is added in place of the SHAPE reagent, in an otherwise identical reaction.

This is corrected using the Signal Decay Correction tool. Third, the Mobility Shift tool is used to align (+) reagent, (\u2212) reagent, and dideoxy sequencing traces, since the different fluorescent dyes introduce small offsets in the raw electropherogram in their respective labeled cDNA fragments. Mobility shifts are performed manually using the sliding traces function in ShapeFinder. Fourth, the (+) and (\u2212) reagent traces are scaled to each other to account for differences in signal intensity between the dyes. In general, the lowest (+) reagent peaks, corresponding to low or no SHAPE reactivity, should be scaled to overlap with their corresponding (\u2212) reagent peaks. Finally, the Align and Integrate tool is used to align all peaks with the known primary sequence (supplied as a .seq text file), to make minor adjustments in peak alignments, and to integrate all peaks in the (+) and (\u2212) reagent traces. When the calculation is complete, a text file called the peaks file is generated (Fig. 2 ).

The thermodynamics-based computational methods outlined above (Section 1.1) are highly useful for rapid computation of candidate structural models. However, prediction accuracies are inconsistent for many RNAs and tend to be particularly poor for large RNAs. These limitations can be broadly attributed to simplifications inherent in the nearest-neighbor model and incomplete knowledge of RNA energetics. However, for many RNAs, it is possible to obtain robust secondary structure predictions by incorporating SHAPE reactivities into the energy function used in a nearest neighbor dynamic programming algorithm.

The NMIA and 1M7 SHAPE reagents react with all four RNA nucleotides with limited base-dependent preferences [65] .

Given the large size (2,904 nts) of the E. coli 23S rRNA and the diversity of structural motifs it contains, these parameter values are also likely to work well for other RNAs. We empirically find this to be the case, although slightly different parameter values, still in the sweet spot (Fig. 3) , can be chosen heuristically to refine predictions for some RNAs [41] . The logarithmic relationship between SHAPE reactivities and the derived \u0394G SHAPE term has the effect of forgiving differences among the most highly reactive nucleotides. The usefulness of this behavior reflects the observation that highly reactive nucleotides are the most sensitive to signal processing artifacts and have the highest variance. Furthermore, the logarithmic relationship between SHAPE reactivity and pseudo-free energy change loosely reflects a statistical mechanical interpretation of SHAPE reactivity, which indirectly measures the number of conformational states accessible to each nucleotide.",

Nucleotides with high SHAPE reactivities have positive pseudo-free energies and those with low SHAPE reactivities have negative pseudo-free energies (Eqn. 1). \u0394G SHAPE terms are only added to the free energy calculation for base paired nucleotides (Fig. 4 , black numbers). \u0394G SHAPE terms for nucleotides at the ends of helices are counted once and those in the interior of helices are counted twice since they contribute to two stacks (Fig. 4 , blue \u00d71 and \u00d72 symbols, respectively). Base paired nucleotides with high SHAPE reactivities contribute large positive pseudo-free energies (for example, see the red G in Fig. 4) . Such nucleotides are more likely to be allowed at the end, as opposed to the interior, of a helix because they are added to the total free energy only once. This is consistent with the observation that nucleotides at the ends of helices are more dynamic, and experience greater fraying, than interior nucleotides. On the other hand, unpaired nucleotides with low SHAPE reactivities represent an incomplete model and could suggest non-canonical interactions that are not currently predicted by the algorithm (for example, see the tandem black G residues in the apical loop of Fig. 4) . The total folding energy (\u0394G total ) is simply the sum of all nearest neighbor thermodynamic terms (\u0394G NN ) and pseudo-free energy (\u0394G SHAPE ) contributions (Fig. 4) . This sum is used to rank RNA structures and should not be interpreted as a physical energy because it includes both thermodynamic terms and SHAPE-derived pseudo-free energy change terms.",

After excluding these outliers, the next 10% of intensities are averaged and all reactivities, including outliers, are divided by this value. Generally, we suggest using the box-plot method if the sequence is long enough for meaningful statistics to be calculated (typically > 300 reactivity measurements).

More than 99% of all known ribosomal RNA pairings span less than 600 nucleotides and applying this restriction increases prediction accuracy for the 16S and 23S rRNAs [30] . Applying this constraint is also attractive from the perspective of RNA folding kinetics, since RNA folding likely occurs co-transcriptionally, and nucleotides located very far from each other are unlikely to have the opportunity to base pair.

For such positions, one of two methods is used to signal the RNAstructure program to use only thermodynamic parameters when calculating energies involving these nucleotides. The row containing the nucleotide number and its reactivity can be deleted from the .shape file or the SHAPE reactivity can be replaced with a value \u2264 \u2212500.

Finally, known single stranded regions or those that interact with another RNA or protein can be prohibited from forming base pairs by assigning these nucleotides a high SHAPE reactivity value (by convention, we set these to 100).

            "text": "We conclude this review with an example from HIV-1 biology describing how SHAPEconstrained RNAstructure calculations can be used to propose new structural models for RNA domains. The human immunodeficiency virus maximizes coding efficiency through the use of overlapping reading frames in its RNA genome. The gene coding for Pol, the polyprotein precursor for viral enzymes, does not have its own start codon but, instead, is encoded in an open reading frame that is offset by -1 nucleotide relative to the upstream Gag reading frame. In order to translate Pol, the ribosome initially translates Gag before pausing, backing up 1 nucleotide, and proceeding to translate the pol reading frame [69] . This process is called frameshifting and occurs at a conserved heptanucleotide UUUUUUA \"slippery\" sequence with a frequency of approximately 5-10% [70, 71] . The precise level of frameshifting is crucial for viral replication and the ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol polyprotein products appears to be tightly regulated [72] . The HIV-1 frameshift element is thus an intriguing target for antiretroviral drug development [71, 73] .",

However, comparisons with ribosomal frameshift structures from other retroviruses and experimental evidence that this classical stem-loop is necessary, but not sufficient, for frameshifting [75, 76] have motivated alternative proposals for this element. These alternative structures include pseudoknots [77] [78] [79] and a two-stem model (Fig. 5B ) [80] .

Most strikingly, nucleotides in the slippery sequence (blue boxes, Fig. 5 ) have mostly low SHAPE reactivities. These experimental measurements indicate that the slippery sequence is base paired (or otherwise constrained) rather than being single stranded in the intact genome as isolated from viruses. Furthermore, when SHAPE reactivities are used to direct RNAstructure folding calculations of the entire intact genome, analysis of the frameshift region in its global context suggests that this functional element is one part of a much larger, 140-nucleotide long, structural unit (Fig. 5C) . Further work will clearly be needed to discriminate among these models and to determine whether the frameshift element might adopt multiple conformations during HIV-1 replication. However, this example illustrates the ability of SHAPE-constrained folding to identify elements of current models that may be incomplete and to facilitate development of new RNA structure models in the context of their global, native-like, sequence and structural environments.",

            "text": "The SHAPE-constrained RNA folding approach outlined here provides a straightforward way of proposing, validating, and refining accurate secondary structure models for nearly any RNA. Current limitations in the SHAPE approach remain active research focuses, including the requirement for pmol-scale amounts of RNA, which can be difficult to obtain in some cases, and the inability to directly predict pseudoknots and other tertiary interactions. SHAPEconstrained RNA folding is particularly valuable for the large universe of functionally important RNAs for which there is little evolutionary data and for which high-resolution structure determination is unrealizable. In addition, the ability to probe RNA structures in cellular and viral environments or in native-like extracted forms can provide biological insights that are not obtainable using simplified in vitro models. Continued development of SHAPE reagents and of algorithms for using experimental information to constrain RNA structure prediction will expand the classes of RNA motifs and structure-function relationships that can be understood at a molecular level. Overview of the SHAPE experimental and data analysis steps. Adapted from ref. [60] . Overview of the steps involved in processing capillary electrophoresis data, obtaining normalized SHAPE reactivities, and calculating experimentally-informed RNA secondary structure models [11, 30, 39, 60] . Summary of thermodynamic and SHAPE-derived free energy change contributions for a simple HIV-1 hairpin (NL4-3 nucleotides 594 -626) [41] . Favorable nearest-neighbor stacking and unfavorable loop thermodynamic terms are shown in green and red, respectively. The total nearest neighbor free energy change \u0394G NN is the sum over all these contributions. \u0394G SHAPE pseudo-free energy change terms are shown for base paired (black) and non-base paired (gray) nucleotides; only base paired values are included in the net free energy change. The \u0394G SHAPE term is added once for each nucleotide at the ends of helices and twice for interior nucleotides (blue symbols). The \u0394G SHAPE calculations used m = 3.0 kcal/mol and b = \u22120.6 RNA secondary structure models for the HIV-1 M-group Gag-Pol frameshift element. All models are colored by their SHAPE reactivities as reported in [41] using the scale shown in Figure 4 . The \"slippery sequence\" where frameshifting occurs is enclosed in a blue box. The numbering is for the NL4-3 reference sequence. (A) Classical model [69] . (B) Two-stem model [80] . (C) SHAPE-supported model [41] . Table 1 RNA secondary structure prediction accuracies for folding calculations performed without and with SHAPE constraints Sensitivity and PPV are the percentage of known base pairs predicted correctly and the percentage of predicted base pairs in the known structure, respectively. Calculations were performed using RNAstructure [11] . Accuracies for SHAPE-constrained structures are typically \u226595%. However, accuracy for the RNase Pspecificity domain is significantly lower, likely because many base pairs in this RNA only form in concert with the tertiary structure [62] . Data are from refs.
