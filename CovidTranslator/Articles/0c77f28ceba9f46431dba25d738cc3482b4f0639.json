            "text": "The Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is an infectious disease of high virulence and mortality caused by a negative sense RNA nairovirus. The genomic RNA of CCHFV is enwrapped by its nucleoprotein. Positively charged residues on CCHFV nucleoprotein provide multiple binding sites to facilitate genomic RNA encapsidation. In the present work, we investigated the mechanism underlying preferential packaging of the negative sense genomic RNA by CCHFV nucleoprotein in the presence of host cell RNAs during viral assembly. The work included genome sequence analyses for different families of negative and positive sense RNA viruses, using serial docking experiments and molecular dynamic simulations. Our results indicated that the main determinant parameter of the nucleoprotein binding affinity for negative sense RNA is the ratio of purine/pyrimidine in the RNA molecule. A negative sense RNA with a purine/pyrimidine ratio ([1) higher than that of a positive sense RNA (\\1) exhibits higher affinity for the nucleoprotein. Our calculations revealed that a negative sense RNA expresses about 0.5 kJ/mol higher binding energy per nucleotide compared to a positive sense RNA. This energy difference produces a binding energy high enough to make the negative sense RNA, the preferred substrate for packaging by CCHFV nucleoprotein in the presence of cellular or complementary positive sense RNAs. The outcome of this study may contribute to ongoing researches on other viral diseases caused by negative sense RNA viruses such as Ebola virus which poses a security threat to all humanity.",

Although, the difference seemed trivial, but statistical analyses indicated significantly higher ratio for negative sense RNA compared to positive sense one at p value \\.05. Given their higher abundance, the larger purine bases bind stronger (via stacking and/or hydrogen bonding) to counter amino acids residues on CCHFV nucleoprotein than pyrimidine bases. In order to test this hypothesis, we first constructed four mono nucleotides of G, A, C and U by ArgusLab software and optimized their chemical structures. The optimized nucleotides then were docked to CCHFV nucleoproteins (3U3I and 4AQG for monomeric and 4AQF for trimeric forms) using Hex 6.3 and blind mode of docking. Binding energy of the best 100 docked structures then averaged as binding affinity. As expected, our data showed that the binding energy of mononucleotides to 3U3I nucleoprotein were -454.58, -128.84, -122.78 and -122.56 kJ/mol for G, A, U and C respectively. The same patterns were seen when using monomeric 4AQG and trimeric 4AQF nucleoproteins as targets (data not shown). As evidenced, purine nucleotides show higher binding energies than pyrimidine nucleotides. Furthermore, the content of each nucleotides in the genomes of negative sense RNA viruses calculated as percentage (mean \u00b1 SD) were 31.20 \u00b1 2.44, 21.09 \u00b1 2.07, 26.46 \u00b1 1.97 and 21.22 \u00b1 2.09 for A, G, T and C nucleotide respectively, showing prominently higher content for A nucleotide. The same calculation for genome composition of positive sense RNA viruses indicated 28.49 \u00b1 2.10, 20.45 \u00b1 2.57, 31.74 \u00b1 3.14 and 19.31 \u00b1 3.87 % for A, G, T and C nucleotide contents respectively. Interestingly, when the actual count of genomic nucleotides for negative and positive sense RNA viruses (as listed in Tables 1, 2) are multiplied by their corresponding energies, the resulting total binding energy of negative sense RNA become significantly higher than that of positive sense RNA by 0.5 kJ/mol per nucleotide. This energy builds up a significant barrier for positive sense RNA to be packaged, as genetic material, by CCHFV nucleoprotein instead of/or concomitantly with negative sense RNA during virus assembly. This confers the negative sense RNA with a greater affinity for CCHFV nucleoproteins and hence preferential binding, As evidenced, this binding preference is driven by higher proportion of adenine rather than other nucleotides. What remains to be answered, at this stage, is whether the preferential binding of CCHFV nucleoproteins Viral Nucleoproteins in CCHFV 93",

Using single-stranded oligonucleotides with 2-8 nucleotides long, our serial docking experiments revealed that the binding interface of CCHFV nucleoprotein and RNA involves only 3-4 nucleotides and their counter residues. Therefore, to study the effect of nucleotide sequence on binding energy, we constructed 64 possible sequences of trimeric and 256 possible sequences of tetrameric nucleotides using G, A, C and U nucleotides and optimized their chemical structures. These nucleotide structures were then docked to optimized structures of CCHFV nucleoproteins (3U3I and 4AQG for monomeric and 4AQF for trimeric forms). ANOVA analysis of the best 100 resulted structures from each docking experiments showed that the binding energies of trimeric and tetrameric sequences are significantly sequence independent (p value \\.05). In other words, the binding energy of oligonucleotides is only dependent to the total content of purine bases but not to the sequence of nucleotides in RNA string. In the next step, a short RNA (21 nucleotides) as well as a long RNA (42 nucleotide) both in negative and positive sense states were used and docked to monomeric (3U3I and 4AQG) and trimeric (4AQF) forms of CCHFV nucleoproteins. Figure 1 plots average binding energies obtained for the best 100 structures of each negative and positive sense RNAs with different nucleoprotein structures. As indicated, negative sense RNA exhibited significantly higher binding energy than positive sense RNA (p value \\.05) with either monomeric (3U3I and 4AQG) or trimeric (4AQF) nucleoproteins as docking targets. This finding suggests that CCHFV nucleoproteins bind more tightly to negative sense RNA than positive one.

In all cases, the same outputs were obtained for short and long RNAnucleoprotein complexes. Figure 2a shows root mean square displacement (RMSD) curve of CCHFV nucleoprotein during simulation of its complexes with both negative and positive sense RNAs. The curve indicates that CCHFV nucleoprotein undergoes similar patterns of structural alterations in the presence of either senses of RNA which ultimately converge towards equilibrated states. As the structural alterations exerted by MD force are similar during these simulations, therefore, both systems may be used for further comparative studies. Figure 2b illustrates RMSD change of RNA chains against protein back-bone for both negative and positive sense RNA complexes. This curve provides a good tool to explore the movement of RNA relative to protein backbone during simulation. The initial phase of RMSD curve (0-5,000 ps) marks a sharper increase in RMSD for the negative sense RNA in contrast to positive sense RNA. Towards formation of RNA-CCHFV nucleoprotein complexes, the faster movement of negative sense RNA means that this docked RNA chain has a closer position to that in the final conformation and so proceeds faster to reach the final state. After this initial phase has elapsed, the negative sense RNA reaches a more stable state which restricts further movement, hence, its RMSD curve progresses with steeper slope than that of its counter RNA (Fig. 2b) . However, the positive sense RNA does not reach a stable state until about 12,000 ps of simulation after which both systems of RNA chains attain certain stable conformations with no further reasonable increase in RMSD values.",

The lower RMSF of CCHFV nucleoprotein complex with negative sense RNA compared to its complex with positive sense RNA indicates lower flexibility and therefore more stable conformation of the former complex.

This Fig. 1 Binding energy for CCHFV nucleoproteins (monomers of 3U3I, 4AQG and trimer of 4AQF) to negative and positive sense RNAs' with short and long length obtained from blind docking experiments using Hex 6.1 software parameter indirectly reflects the stability of RNA-nucleoprotein complex against applied MD forces. The sharper increase of MSD curve for the positive sense RNA indicates reduced stability of its complex with CCHFV nucleoprotein and its free movement inside protein during simulation. This finding is yet another indication on the stability of the negative sense RNA-nucleoprotein complex. Figure 5 shows the hydrophobic solvent accessible surface (SAS) of the nucleoprotein for complex formation with negative and positive RNA during simulation. Increase in SAS during simulation could be interpreted as to be the result of structural alterations of nucleoprotein which leads to orientation of hydrophobic residues towards outside for RNA binding. Showing an elevated SAS curve, the negative sense RNA seems to exert more structural alterations in CCHFV nucleoprotein during simulation than its counter RNA does. This is again another indication of a stronger binding of the negative sense RNA with the nucleoprotein. The stronger binding of the negative sense RNA is also confirmed by a significant decrease in the content of the protein secondary structure of alpha helix (p value \\.05) from 35.14 \u00b1 2.5 to 30.2 \u00b1 3.0 % (mean \u00b1 SD) as shown in Fig. 6 . This finding also is in agreement with increased changes in nucleoprotein structure caused by the presence of negative sense RNA. Figure 7a represents the final conformation of positive and negative sense RNA complexes with CCHFV nucleoprotein. In order to clarify the binding pattern, we only showed the secondary structure elements of the protein instead of showing all atoms. Helices of a 5 and a 6 which are placed in the vicinity of CCHFV binding site are shown in blue, while RNA molecules are shown as balls and sticks. As seen, negative sense RNA (right scheme) fits better to CCHFV binding site in the region between head and stalk domains. In contrast, positive sense RNA (left scheme) is placed somewhat far from binding site. Figure 7a -b reconfirm the fact that the negative sense RNA binds better and fits more effectively than the positive sense RNA to its binding crevice throughout simulation.",

Our docking experiments confirm higher binding energies of 0.5 kJ/mol per nucleotide for negative sense RNA.

Attenuated curve of RMSF for CCHFV nucleoprotein in complex with the negative sense RNA compared to the positive sense RNA (Fig. 3) indicates the formation of a more stable complex with lower flexibility in CCHFV nucleoprotein. Moreover, curves of the hydrophobic solvent accessible surface (SAS) (Fig. 5 ) and the significant decrease in secondary structure (Fig. 6 ) confirmed stronger interactions between the negative sense RNA and CCHFV nucleoprotein during simulation hence inducing structural alterations of CCHFV nucleoprotein. Finally the extracted structures of binding site residues indicated the presence of more positive residues in CCHFV for negative sense RNA binding ( Fig. 7a-b) . ",

Outward movement of these helices in gating mechanism open the binding site and permit RNA entrance and binding to virus nucleoprotein [46] . Nevertheless the negative and the positive sense RNAs here bind almost to the same binding site reported for Lassa Virus (Fig. 7) . However, our simulation trajectories indicate that there is neither a significant movement in a 5 and a 6 helices nor a significant disturbance in residues string of 112-122 to support the gating mechanism. Instead, we conclude that CCHFV nucleoprotein may act via different mechanism. Cocrystallization of CCHFV nucleoproteins with negative and positive sense RNAs, X-ray crystallography and performing MD simulations in conditions similar to those in virus seems to be the only way to elucidate the precise mechanism underlying RNA binding to CCHFV nucleoprotein.",

The positively charged groups lining the binding sites which make electrostatic interactions with negative backbone of RNA are labeled. These binding sites are extracted from the first and last frame of simulated systems trajectories for positive (top couple) and negative (bottom couple) sense RNA complexes using WebLab Viewer Lite 4.0 software. As depicted, in the top-left image, the positive sense RNA binds first to Lys 119 , Arg 177 , Arg 195 , Arg 225 and Lys 473 . After 20 ns simulation, RNA experiences a slight alteration (top right image) and gets attached to an additional positive residue of Arg 202 . While, in negative sense RNA, the binding site (bottom-left image) comprises Lys 119 , Arg 177 , Arg 195 , Arg 225 and Lys 292 and Arg 298 with two more positive residues. This finding verifies that the negative sense RNA binds more tightly to CCHFV nucleoprotein. This is because, upon performing 20 ns simulation, the negative sense RNA comes in contact with three extra positive residues including Lys 251 , Lys 282 and Lys 286 (bottom right).",
