This is hampered by the lack of standardized diagnostic testing for many pathogens and the often atypical presentation of infectious diseases in immunocompromised patients. Additionally, many of the more commonly used antimicrobials have signifi cant drug interactions with immunosuppressive medications, putting the patient at risk for allograft rejection or toxic adverse effects. 4 Some drug-drug interactions of importance are listed in Table 90-1 ; however, the clinician should always check for drug interactions before prescribing any antimicrobial, preferably with the input of a clinical pharmacist, if available.",

One helpful method of thinking about infection in the transplant patient is to consider how much time has elapsed since the transplant occurred, because some infections tend to manifest during certain time windows after surgery. This fi nding has been summarized in chart form by Fishman 5 (Fig. 90-1 ). In the fi rst month post-transplant, nosocomial infections tend to predominate, including wound and catheter-related bacterial and fungal infections, and fl ares of prior latent or allografttransmitted viruses if no prophylaxis is given (i.e., herpes simplex virus [HSV] , hepatitis B, hepatitis C). During the following 5 months, viral infections predominate, including reactivation or primary infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), or cytomegalovirus (CMV), although if the patient is receiving antiviral prophylaxis, disease may be delayed until prophylaxis is discontinued. Patients are also increasingly susceptible to communityacquired respiratory viruses, environmental fungi, and parasites as they begin to travel and congregate with others outside the healthcare setting. After 6 months, the risk of opportunistic infections declines as the period of maximum immunosuppression passes, and community-acquired pathogens and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) tend to be more common.",

            "text": "Cytomegalovirus is the most important viral infection that develops after solid organ transplant and is associated with signifi cant morbidity and mortality. 9 CMV is a member of the Betaherpesvirus family; its seroprevalence in the general adult population ranges from 50% to 80% by age 40, and the virus establishes lifelong latency in the host. 10 Primary infection with CMV in the immunocompetent host may be asymptomatic or may manifest as fever, malaise, and a mononucleosistype syndrome. After primary infection, the virus typically remains latent with no systemic signs or symptoms of reactivation. However, in the transplant recipient, the effects of CMV are myriad, including a viral syndrome with fever, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia that may be compounded by immunosuppressive medications, and also tissue-invasive disease, potentially involving the transplanted organ as well as the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract and, rarely, the retina. 11 CMV also has been associated with several indirect effects in solid organ tranplant patients, including increased risk of rejection, reduced long-term survival, increased risk of other opportunistic infections, bacterial infections, and allograft dysfunction. 12 Prior to the widespread use of antiviral prophylaxis, most CMV disease occurred in the fi rst 3 months after solid organ transplantation, with donor-seropositive/recipient-seronegative patients at the highest risk for disease. In addition to donor seropositivity, other major risk factors for CMV infection and disease include the degree of immunosuppression, including the use of antilymphocyte and OKT3 monoclonal antibody therapy for induction or treatment of rejection, rejection itself, and other concurrent viral infections (e.g., human herpesvirus 6 [HHV-6] infection). 9 Primary CMV infection via the transplanted organ in the seronegative recipient, reactivation of latent disease in the seropositive recipient, and superinfection of donor virus in the seropositive recipient can all cause symptomatic disease. Two strategies have been used for CMV prevention in at-risk patients: universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy.",

            "text": "Universal CMV prophylaxis involves giving antiviral therapy to all \"at-risk\" patients (i.e., those with either a CMVseropositive donor or recipient) at the time of transplantation or immediately afterward for a specifi ed period with the goal of preventing CMV disease during the period of maximum immunosuppression. This approach may be preferable in patients in whom close monitoring for CMV disease is not possible or practical. Although numerous approaches (including acyclovir, valacyclovir, and CMV immunoglobulin) have been associated with a reduction in CMV disease, ganciclovir has been the mainstay of both CMV treatment and prophylaxis in solid organ transplant recipients after studies showed improved effi cacy over acyclovir in this population. [13] [14] [15] The intravenous form of ganciclovir has given way to oral formulations at many centers due to ease of administration. Oral ganciclovir has a signifi cantly lower bioavailability than the intravenous form, but at doses of 1 gram three times a day it has proven effi cacy in reducing the incidence of CMV disease. 16 The valine ester prodrug of ganciclovir, valganciclovir, has improved bioavailability compared to oral ganciclovir, and at doses of 900 mg daily has been shown to be equally effi cacious in renal transplant patients, 17 with a slightly increased incidence of neutropenia compared to ganciclovir (8.2% vs. 3.2%). Valganciclovir is not indicated for patients undergoing combined liver and kidney transplantation due to reports of breakthrough CMV disease in liver transplant recipients receiving valganciclovir prophylaxis. 18 Preemptive therapy requires close monitoring of patients for signs of CMV reactivation or primary infection, with prompt initiation of anti-CMV therapy to prevent progression to CMV disease. Blood CMV DNA or RNA levels or CMV antigenemia assays can be utilized at weekly intervals for the initial post-transplantation phase, and then at longer intervals as immunosuppression is reduced. Culture techniques, including shell vials, have fallen out of favor due to long turnaround times or poor sensitivity. A randomized trial of prophylactic or preemptive oral valganciclovir was published in 2006, comparing prophyloctic valganciclavir 900 mg daily for 100 days posttransplant and preemptive valganciclovir 900 mg twice a day for 21 days; the trial measured whether CMV DNA levels rose above 2000 copies/mL in blood samples assessed weekly for the fi rst 16 weeks and then at 5, 6, 9, and 12 months post-transplant. There were no signifi cant differences in effi cacy in the prevention of CMV disease, and a costsensitivity analysis was similar for both approaches. 19 The optimal duration of CMV prophylaxis remains unclear. Now that many centers use prophylaxis for the fi rst 3 months after transplant, CMV disease typically occurs later after transplantation, most often at a median of 5 months post-transplant in donor-seropositive/recipient-seronegative patients. 20, 21 Unfortunately, extension of prophylaxis beyond 3 months raises concerns of drug toxicity or the development of drug resistance, although a study of 301 high-risk solid organ transplant patients who received 100 days of valganciclovir prophylaxis failed to show the development of drug resistance. 22 Monitoring immune markers of CMV also does not appear to be predictive of the development of CMV disease, as a recent study by LaRosa and colleagues 23 suggests. This study examined interferon gamma release from T cells at biweekly intervals between 4 and 6 months after transplant. No association was found between presence or absence of T-cell response and development of CMV disease. 23 However, the failure to develop IgG antibodies at 6 months' posttransplant in patients seronegative at the time of transplant may be predictive of late-onset CMV disease (10% developed disease vs. 1.3% of patients with CMV IgG by 6 months). 24 Standard treatment of CMV disease uses intravenous ganciclovir, 5 mg/kg twice daily (with dose adjustments for renal insuffi ciency) and reduction of immunosuppression until resolution of symptoms and CMV viremia. Unfortunately, ganciclovir-resistant CMV has emerged as an uncommon but growing problem in the solid organ transplant population, perhaps due to prolonged use of oral ganciclovir prophylaxis and more potent immunosuppression regimens. 25 Although this has not been commonly reported in recipients of kidney transplants alone, it may occur more frequently in pancreas transplant recipients; a major risk factor for this is prolonged exposure to low-dose ganciclovir during periods of asymptomatic infection. Resistance can be detected via phenotypic or genotypic testing, but usually requires additional time. Failure to respond to adequate dosing of ganciclovir should raise a suspicion of ganciclovir resistance, and substitution of another antiviral agent may be warranted. Options for the treatment of resistant CMV include foscarnet with or without ganciclovir and cidofovir, both of which may be highly nephrotoxic, especially when used in the context of calcineurin inhibitors. Adjunctive intravenous immunoglobulin (CMV specifi c or nonspecifi c) has been used for treatment of refractory CMV disease, although there are no large-scale trials or specifi c guidelines for its use. 11",

            "text": "Similar to CMV, EBV is a ubiquitous herpesvirus that also establishes latent infection in the host. EBV is a member of the Gammaherpesvirus family along with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8)/Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). EBV infection in the immunocompetent host may be asymptomatic if acquired during childhood or may result in infectious mononucleosis in young adults. More than 90% of the population is seropositive by adulthood. In the transplant recipient, EBV is associated with PTLD, a group of disorders involving varying degrees of abnormal B-cell and T-cell proliferation. Patients at highest risk for PTLD are seronegative recipients who acquire primary infection after transplantation, making pediatric patients especially vulnerable. The virus is effi ciently transmitted via saliva and other body fl uids, but may also be transmitted by lymphocytes in the transplanted allograft. The risk of PTLD varies by the organ transplanted, with small-bowel transplant recipients at highest risk; lung, heart, pancreas, and liver patients at moderate risk; and renal transplant recipients at lowest risk (approximately 1%). [26] [27] [28] Other risk factors include the type and duration of immunosuppression, including OKT3 and polyclonal antibody use. A recent analysis of the French Registry of PTLD in renal transplant recipients demonstrated an incidence of 1.18% after 5 years, with a 61% survival rate at 5 years after diagnosis. 29 Infection with hepatitis B or C was also noted to be a risk factor for patient death, in addition to the more commonly recognized risk factors.",

Staging should be performed with special attention paid to allograft involvement, the presence of multifocal disease, including involvement of the central nervous system, and the category of PTLD (i.e., monomorphic vs. polymorphic, B cell vs. T cell). EBV viral load testing has not yet been established as an accepted diagnostic test for PTLD because viremia is variable and does not correlate specifi cally with the presence or absence of PTLD. A low viral load has good negative predictive value, but a high viral load is nonspecifi c, and certain subtypes of PTLD are EBV-negative. 30, 31 Studies are currently underway examining different EBV antigens as markers for patients at risk for developing PTLD and possibly also as surrogate markers for global immunosuppression levels.",

Identifi cation of high-risk recipients is recommended, specifi cally EBVseronegative recipients and those at risk for CMV disease. Avoidance of overzealous immunosuppression should be encouraged as well, because this has been shown to be a risk factor for development of PTLD. The benefi t of antiviral prophylaxis specifi cally targeted toward EBV has not been established, but CMV prophylaxis regimens may have some benefi t in reducing the risk for PTLD. The use of prophylactic CMV intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) did not prove effi cacious in a small clinical trial. 32 Treatment of early PTLD begins with reduction of immunosuppression, which may result in spontaneous regression in 23% to 50% of cases. In renal transplant patients, confi rmed PTLD should prompt cessation of immunosuppression, even at the expense of rejection of the allograft. Retransplantation after recovery from PTLD is possible, with a recent OPTN/ UNOS database study showing retransplantation patient survival of 100% and graft survival of 88.9% at a mean follow-up of 742 \u00b1 107 days. 33 Other treatment modalities include surgical debulking of the tumor or explant of the allograft, if involved; referral to an oncologist for monoclonal B-cell antibody therapy (rituximab) if the tumor cells are CD20\u03e9; and cytotoxic chemotherapy for refractory disease. A variety of other treatment modalities are under investigation, including anti-interleukin-6, interferon alfa, and adoptive immunotherapy using the patient's own lymphocytes activated ex vivo. 27 Late-onset or EBV-negative PTLD typically does not respond as well to reduction of immunosuppression and thus requires more aggressive therapeutic measures, so early consultation with an oncologist is prudent in these patients.",

Both tend to cause primary infection in childhood, such as roseola infantum, exanthema subitum, or other nonspecifi c febrile illnesses, and then establish latency in adults, with 90% of adults demonstrating seropositivity for the viruses. 34 The role of reactivation of these viruses in the post-transplantation period is still under investigation, but it appears that they may have immunomodulatory effects either independently or in combination, especially in that reactivation of HHV-6 and HHV-7 is often found in the context of CMV disease. Primary disease caused by HHV-6 has been reported to include bone marrow suppression, encephalitis, hepatitis, colitis, pneumonitis, and fatal hemophagocytic syndromes, 34,37-39 whereas primary HHV-7 syndromes have been less well-described. In a prospective study of Betaherpesvirus viremia after renal transplantation, CMV was the most commonly detected virus, occurring in 58% of patients; HHV-7 occurred earliest (in 47%) of patients, and HHV-6 occurred in 23% of patients. 40 Interestingly, the authors found a correlation between HHV-7 viremia and increased number of rejection episodes in an analysis restricted only to patients with rejection (overall there was no association between presence of Betaherpesvirus viremia and occurrence of rejection), and there was an increased incidence of CMV disease in patients who demonstrated infection with both CMV and HHV-7. 40 Detection of HHV-6 and HHV-7 can be accomplished by nucleic acid testing, but prevention strategies remain undefi ned. Ganciclovir may be effective for HHV-6 prophylaxis, but variability of susceptibility to this agent may exist between the A and B variants of the virus. HHV-7 does not appear to be affected by ganciclovir prophylaxis, 41 and both viruses appear to be resistant to acyclovir. Optimal treatment of these viruses is clouded by frequent coinfection with CMV. Ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir appear to reduce HHV-6 and HHV-7 viremia when used for coincident CMV disease, but it is unclear if this reduction is due to clearance of CMV and resolution of its immunomodulatory effects, or direct antiviral effects on HHV-6 or HHV-7. Individual case reports of reduction of immunosuppression and ganciclovir treatment for HHV-6 infection have been published. 37",

Seropositivity for HHV-8 is more geographically restricted than for other herpesviruses, with highest prevalence rates in Africa and the Middle East. In the United States, seroprevalence is estimated to be less than 5%, although in certain populations (i.e., men who have sex with men) the rates may be higher. 42 Seroconversion post-transplant appears to depend on the donor status and perhaps the geographical location of the recipient, although a study of 100 solid organ transplant recipients in Pittsburgh showed seropositivity rose from 5.3% to 15.8% after transplantation with presumed donor-negative organs (90% documented as negative via serum sample), regardless of patient age or type of organ received. 43 Incidence of KS has been estimated to be up to 500 times higher in solid organ transplant recipients as compared to the general population, 44 and rates in the United States have been reported to be from 0.5% to 6%. Most U.S. patients present with cutaneous KS, and disease occurs a median of 30 months after transplantation. 34 Detection of HHV-8 antibodies is useful for establishing seroconversion, and an assay for the detection of serum nucleic acid is available for detection of viremia. No guidelines exist for prevention of disease, although the replicating virus appears to be susceptible in vitro to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. 34 Treatment of post-transplantation KS depends on the extent of disease (i.e., cutaneous or visceral involvement), but typically begins with reduction of immunosuppression; if necessary radiotherapy and chemotherapy may be added for more extensive disease. Recently a series of 15 renal transplant recipients with post-transplantation KS were successfully treated with discontinuation of cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil and addition of sirolimus. 45 Sirolimus, an immunosuppressive medication that targets mTOR and prevents interleukin-2-induced proliferation of T cells, inhibits the growth of several tumor cell lines in vitro, and inhibits Akt, a protein kinase in the mTOR signaling pathway that has been implicated in KS pathogenesis. Sirolimus trough levels were maintained between 6 and 10 ng/mL, and no episodes of rejection occurred in any of the patients. 45 Respiratory Viruses (Adenovirus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Infl uenza, Parainfl uenza) the hospital are the primary means of prevention of these viruses, along with yearly infl uenza vaccination for all transplant recipients, household contacts, and healthcare workers.",

            "text": "RSV is a common pediatric pathogen that causes seasonal disease in the winter months, usually among children age 2 and younger. It appears that immunity to the virus is not lifelong, and transplant recipients may manifest more severe disease than immunocompetent hosts. Manifestations are typically pulmonary, and the development of lower respiratory tract disease portends a worse prognosis. 48 The benefi t of prophylaxis with palivizumab or RSV-IVIG in adult transplant recipients has not been proven. Data are limited for treatment of established RSV disease in solid organ transplant patients, but some benefi t may exist for the use of aerosolized ribavirin in combination with palivizumab or RSV-IVIG early in lower tract disease. 48 The mainstay of prevention of infl uenza A and B is the yearly vaccination of the transplant recipient and their close contacts. 6, 49 The preferred vaccine is a combination of inactivated antigens from strains of infl uenza A and B that are predicted via epidemiological studies to circulate for a given year; thus, the composition may change on a yearly basis. Although the response of transplant patients is lower than that of healthy immunocompetent individuals, suffi cient levels of protection are likely to occur in most individuals. Early concerns about an increased risk of graft rejection as a result of the immune response to vaccination have not been supported by the literature, and a recent multicenter retrospective analysis of rejection in more than 3000 heart transplant recipients found no association between infl uenza vaccination and episodes of rejection. 50 If infection is suspected, rapid treatment should be initiated within 48 hours of symptom development concurrently with a diagnostic test such as nucleic acid detection. Neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivir) have become the mainstay of therapy because they are effi cacious against both A and B strains of infl uenza; however, studies specifi cally evaluating their effi cacy in transplant recipients have yet to be conducted. 48 Treatment dosing of oseltamivir is 75 mg orally twice a day for 5 days (zanamivir is only available as an inhaled agent). Prophylaxis with oseltamivir may also be benefi cial within 48 hours in cases of known or suspected exposure to infl uenza at a dose of 75 mg orally once a day for a minimum of 10 days. The use of amantidine or rimantidine has fallen out of favor due to the lack of effi cacy against infl uenza B and the recent reports of resistance of infl uenza A during the 2006 infl uenza season. 51 Parainfl uenza viruses 1 and 2 tend to circulate in the fall and winter months, and typically produce nonspecifi c upper respiratory tract symptoms. There is currently no vaccine, prophylaxis, or accepted treatment regimens for these viruses. 48",

Widespread use of the hepatitis B vaccine was adopted in 1982, further reducing the incidence of hepatitis B acquisition. 52 Vaccination of all patients with compensated renal disease well in advance of dialysis dependence should be encouraged using a four-dose vaccine schedule (0, 1, 2, and 6 months), and yearly monitoring of HBsAb titers should be conducted, with booster vaccination given as needed. 53 Currently the prevalence among hemodialysis patients is approximately 1.6%. Among dialysis patients who seroconvert, 80% may develop chronic hepatitis B, and a subset of patients who undergo transplantation after becoming HBsAg-negative will reactivate after the transplant. 54 Patients who receive a transplant when HBsAg-positive have a poorer prognosis with high rates of chronic hepatitis by 10 years (85%) and also an increased likelihood of sepsis and hepatocellular carcinoma in the posttransplant period. 54 A high risk of HBV transmission exists when grafting an HBsAg-positive organ into a seronegative recipient, so this circumstance should be avoided. Transplantation of a hepatitis BsAg-negative/cAb-positive kidney may be undertaken in a seronegative recipient if the recipient is fully vaccinated and the donor is HBV DNA-negative; although the recipient may seroconvert based on the presence of new HBcAb, this did not affect patient survival or graft function. 55 Close follow-up of these recipients with monitoring for transmission of hepatitis B is important; the use of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and pharmacotherapy may be warranted in this situation.",

Treatment with lamivudine typically results in a large reduction in HBV DNA, but resistance may develop with prolonged use of the drug (\u03fe1 to 2 years). 56 This approach is advocated before transplantation to suppress the viral load and should be continued after transplantation in nonhepatic recipients with chronic hepatitis B. Tenofovir and adefovir have both been associated with nephrotoxicity in patients who are not transplant recipients, raising concerns about their safety in renal transplant recipients. Recent data regarding the use of long-term (up to 5 years) adefovir in chronic hepatitis B patients was recently published, suggesting that this agent is well tolerated, with a small risk of renal insuffi ciency at 1 to 3 years and a low risk of development of resistance after 5 years. 57 A smaller analysis of renal transplant recipients with chronic hepatitis B resistant to lamivudine was reported that showed a signifi cant reduction in hepatitis B DNA with no evidence of adefovir-related renal toxicity after a median of 15 months of treatment, although several patients required phosphorus supplementation. 58 Pretransplant treatment with interferon-alfa to reduce viral load and promote seroconversion has been investigated in renal transplant recipients, but specifi c guidelines regarding its use have not been published; this approach is not currently recommended.",

Because transmission of the virus occurs frequently, HCV-seropositive donors now are considered extended-criteria donors and are typically reserved for HCV-positive recipients or other special circumstances. Nucleic acid testing for hepatitis C RNA in antibody-positive renal donors can help identify those donors who are viremic and therefore likely to transmit hepatitis C. 61 The effects of HCV positivity on graft and patient survival have been variable. In a cohort of patients on a renal transplant waiting list, HCV-positive patients had a higher risk of death compared to HCV-negative patients regardless of whether they remained on dialysis or underwent transplantation. 62 However, HCV-positive recipients who underwent transplantation or seronegative recipients who received a HCV-positive kidney had improved long-term survival compared to patients who remained on dialysis after 6 months. 60, [63] [64] [65] HCV infection in the post-transplant period is associated with increased chance of new-onset diabetes mellitus, sepsis, and HCV-related glomerulonephropathy; long-term mortality; and graft failure. 54, [66] [67] [68] [69] Recent studies have suggested that hepatitis C infection in renal transplant patients may not necessarily predispose recipients to rapid progression of liver disease. 70 Increased variability of the hypervariable region (HVR-1) of HCV E 2 glycoprotein may be a predictor of lack of progression of fi brosis. 70, 71 Because of the implications of chronic hepatitis C infection in the post-transplant period, efforts should be made to stage the extent of disease in transplant candidates. Serum transaminases do not refl ect the extent of liver fi brosis or cirrhosis, so a liver biopsy should be performed during the transplant evaluation to determine the extent of liver damage. Treatment of hepatitis C in the pretransplant period should also be considered in an effort to eradicate the virus. 66 Ribavirin and PEG-interferon-alfa combinations are the treatments of choice, but adverse effects such as anemia prevent the use of ribavirin in this population. After transplantation, interferonalfa has been associated with an increased risk of renal failure and possible graft rejection, so it is generally not recommended for use after renal transplantation. 54, 72, 73 ",

            "text": "The BK virus is a double-stranded DNA polyoma virus that infects up to 90% of the adult population and appears to be primarily asymptomatic in the immunocompetent host, although upper respiratory symptoms and cystitis have been reported. 74 In the renal transplant recipient, BK virus can be transmitted by the transplanted organ or can reactivate from latency in seropositive recipients. Typically the virus causes asymptomatic viruria in this population, but in some patients nephropathy with allograft dysfunction or ureteral stenosis or stricture develops as a result of BK disease. The risk factors for development of BK viremia or viruria are unclear, but the extent of immunosuppression appears critical, as does antirejection treatment. 75 The methods and screening intervals used for the diagnosis of BK virus infection are not well-defi ned, but include frequent urine cytological examination looking for abnormal epithelial decoy cells and more sensitive PCR methods of detection of both urine and blood specimens. 76 Nucleic acid techniques also can provide a quantitative assessment of viral load and are able to differentiate between BK virus infection and other viruses that may produce a similar cytological appearance of epithelial cells (i.e., JC virus). Plasma viral loads greater than 10 4 copies/mL and urine viral loads greater than 10 7 copies/mL are suggestive of underlying BK virus nephropathy (BKVN). 77 The diagnosis and staging of BKVN requires renal biopsy, and the incidence of BKVN appears to range between 1% and 10% of renal transplant recipients. Recent research has examined the utility of nucleic acid-based detection techniques as screening tools for the development of BK viruria, viremia, and nephropathy. 78 Both the level of BK viremia and the presence of recurrent viremia have been correlated with the presence of BKVN. 75, 79 Treatment and prevention of BK virus is still evolving. Reduction of immunosuppression remains the mainstay of prevention and therapy of BK viruria, viremia, and nephropathy. Antiviral agents have not been uniformly effi cacious in the prevention or treatment of BK viruria, but several have been anecdotally reported, including cidofovir and lefl unomide. Unfortunately, no randomized, controlled clinical trials have been performed with either of these agents, but their use may be warranted in patients who have severe BKVN with concurrent rejection that may limit reduction of immunosuppresion. 80 Cidofovir has activity against polyoma viruses in vitro, but its nephrotoxicity has led to reduced dosing in renal transplant patients for treatment of BK virus infection (0.25-1 mg/kg given intravenously every 1-3 weeks), and clinical results remain mixed. 80 Of 26 patients with BKVN treated with cidofovir at the University of Pittsburgh, viremia cleared in 25 patients, and 15% lost the graft, compared to a historical graft loss rate of 45% without cidofovir. 81 Lefl unomide, a drug used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, also has antiviral activity against BK virus in vitro, and a limited amount of data is available regarding its clinical utility.",

Radiographic fi ndings may be atypical in transplant recipients and can manifest as diffuse ground-glass infi ltrates, more focal consolidation, or pneumothorax. 87 Prophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for the fi rst 6 months after transplant is strongly recommended, because it also reduces the risk of other opportunistic infections, such as toxoplasmosis, listeriosis, and nocardiosis, as well as bacterial urinary tract infections (UTIs). If the patient cannot tolerate trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, other agents can be used, such as aerosolized pentamidine, atovaquone, and dapsone, but care must be taken to monitor for compliance and adverse effects of the medications. 87 Treatment of Pneumocystis disease should be with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 15 to 20 mg/kg daily in four divided doses, with corticosteroids given if hypoxia with a PO 2 lower than 70 mm Hg by arterial blood gas is documented. A minimum 14-day course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is often suffi cient if immunosuppression can be reduced, and 40 to 60 mg of prednisone for 5 to 7 days followed by a taper is recommended for concomitant hypoxemia.",

The impact of early UTI in renal transplant recipients has been associated with pyelonephritis, bacteremia/septicemia, and increased mortality compared to the general population [88] [89] [90] [91] ; late UTI may also be associated with increased mortality, 92 although most tend to mimic UTIs in the immunocompetent host.

In patients in whom latent TB infection is suggested, treatment with 300 mg of isoniazid daily for 9 months is recommended after evaluation for underlying liver disease. Ideally, prophylaxis should be completed before transplantation and the onset of more severe immunosuppression; however, if the donor had risk factors for latent TB infection, the recipient should receive prophylaxis after transplantation to reduce the risk of transmission of disease. 101 Liver function tests should be monitored every 2 weeks for the fi rst 6 weeks of therapy, then monthly, looking for elevations of transaminases greater than 4 times normal.",

After transplantation, these patients require close monitoring, because the pharmacokinetics and drug interactions of antiretroviral medications and immunosuppressive medications may be complex; notably, there are signifi cant drug interactions between calcineurin inhibitors and antiretroviral agents, including both protease inhibitors and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. 108, 111 Frequent assessment of serum drug levels of the calcineurin inhibitors is therefore mandatory for patients on protease inhibitor-based HAART. More comprehensive guidelines have been established by the Cooperative Clinical Trials in Adult Transplantation group and include specifi c recommendations regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria and pharmacological considerations for HAART, immunosuppression, and prophylaxis regimens. 111 Management of infectious disease complications continues to pose a challenge for physicians treating transplant recipients.
