            "text": "Biological and agricultural diversity are connected to food security through strengthened resilience to both anthropogenic and natural perturbations. Increased resilience to stress via increased biodiversity has been described in a number of natural systems. Diversity in food production can be considered on the following three levels: (a) genetic diversity as reflected in the range of cultivars which can be selected for production; (b) species diversity, captured through production of a wide range of crops on each farm; and (c) broad ecosystem diversity, described by the diversity of production between farms and within the broader food system. A network of locally based food producers and entrepreneurs provides opportunity for high diversity at each network stage, with increased adaptive capacity and the ability for rapid response to disturbance. We argue that production techniques that use carefully planned diverse plantings, such as biointensive cultivation, increase resilience by increased water use efficiency, yield and nutrient retention while reducing pressure from pests and pathogens. We present a model for a diverse, distributed food system in the North Carolina Piedmont and analyze an existing distributed network by a food hub in South Carolina. Through these models, we argue that a shift in the food network has the potential to increase local food security by having food more reliably available where it is needed and by contributing to local resilience through community economic development. The shift in food production and distribution systems serves multiple goals: When crop loss occurs, other crops still contribute to overall harvest, reducing net loss. Diverse on-farm production can support a more distributed network of food aggregators, processors, and markets than the current approach of large-scale consolidation. Finally, a distributed food supply network supported with diverse agricultural products can increase resilience by providing access to diversified markets for producers and improved food access to consumers with more food choices, while expanding the need for skilled jobs supporting the regionally based food industry.",

Resilience can be measured by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed before the system is redefined into a different state (Gunderson 2000) . In the case of agriculture and food security, resilience can be considered from the perspective of food availability with a return to a predictable and adequate supply following a disturbance. In this case, disturbances may occur in production (as with the loss of a crop following a plant disease or pest outbreak, severe weather, or climate change), transportation, processing, distribution, and access/supply.",

            "text": "Building on this, the insurance hypothesis for ecosystem resilience through conservation of functional diversity and responsive scale may be transferable to food systems. In the case of food systems, diversity in farm scale and number, diversity of crops, type of market opportunities, and higher numbers of farms equate to high numbers of species that respond differently to external pressures in ecosystems where diversity provides Binsurance^if one component of the system declines or is lost. To overcome such risks, species with similar traits may be functionally redundant; if a crop is lost because of high disturbance sensitivity (drought or disease, for example), other crops will still provide agricultural product (Mori et al. 2013) . Some techniques such as biointensive agriculture which emphasize high biological diversity are most easily adaptable to small acreage. A concern can be about yield loss under such production techniques. However, intensively managed biointensive farms can produce yields which are comparable and often greater than conventional methods, while enhancing ecosystem structure and functions such as biogeochemical cycles and pest population controls. The contemporary food system is built on a complex network of related activities, ranging from on-farm production to harvest and sale to distribution, processing, and marketing, ending with consumer access, purchase, consumption and resource, and waste recovery. Many related factors including environmental, social, and economic disruptions have the potential to contribute both chronic and acute disturbance to all points in this complex system. It is important to consider resilience at all points in the food system, minimizing vulnerability in each individual sector. Therefore, it is crucial to link the shift in food production systems with a shift in the food distribution mechanisms. Indeed, greater crop diversity offers opportunities for more diverse markets, and a locally embedded network of markets for food sale and access may provide greater resilience by insuring multiple points of entry for sale and access if the system is disrupted. As the two models below, North Carolina Central Piedmont Network and the South Carolina Food Hub demonstrate, decentralized models that link producers to consumers provide opportunities for farmers that utilize high-yield, low input techniques such as biointensive and other agroecological techniques a convenient and reasonable access to markets. Since the techniques can be developed both in urban and rural areas on smaller acreage farms, they can reduce the upfront capitalization costs for a start-up farm and also provide access to food related entrepreneurial opportunities and to food for low-income, ethnically and racially diverse consumers. This paper explores the link between diversity and resilience in our food networks-from production to distribution. We first illustrate risks from loss of biological diversity in food production systems and discuss how biointensive techniques can help overcome such risks. We then discuss two models of food value chains in the Carolinas and how a shift in food distribution mechanisms built on principles of biological diversity can help build food security and community resilience. We also discuss the challenges of establishing such models on the ground and thus offer guidelines for practitioners on how to establish decentralized/local/ networked food production, distribution, and access systems.",

Biointensive production emphasizes high crop spatial and temporal diversity via crop selection and multi-cropping practices. Soil is highly managed for fertility and biological activity through an initial deep tillage and frequent carbon and nitrogen additions through green manures and compost. These techniques are often most suitable for small-scale farming and are able to provide product to the local food supply network for sale and distribution. There is also efficient land use and minimal reliance on mechanized equipment. These options are severely limited in conventional agriculture which is dependent on high acreage, uniform mechanized production (Jeavons 2006) .",

The number of American farms with DTC sales increased by 17 % and sales increased by 32 % between 2002 and 2007; however, between 2007 and 2012, the number of farms with DTC sales increased 5.5 %, with no change in total DTC sales. That DTC sales did not increase may be a reflection that consumer demand has been met (Low and Vogel 2011) .",

In the event of a disruption (natural disaster, economic collapse, contamination of a supply chain), there are multiple alternative channels that can supply a population's food needs, including supplies closer to communities needing food. Disaster notwithstanding, the resilience of the local economy may be increased because of the geographically-linked, skilled jobs that are created: farming, logistics, marketing, storage and distribution, value-added processing, equipment maintenance, input supplier, and many other jobs that cannot be outsourced to non-local entities. In the current national food system, where food is grown and harvested several states away and aggregated by large, centralized corporations, these jobs and skills are not available locally.

Of those, 19,563 worked more than 200 days off farm (US Department of Agriculture 2014). For many of these families, small farm operations provide much needed household income to supplement off-farm, low-wage job earnings (US Department of Agriculture 2014). Small farming operations also present economic opportunities for partially-or fullyretired growers, as well as opportunities for beginning producers interested in scaling up to full-time farm businesses. When farmers utilize high-yield, low input techniques such as biointensive and other agroecological methods, farming businesses can be developed in both urban and rural areas, as smaller acreage farms (typically 0.5-5 acres) are proving their viability.

Similarly, while the prevalence and growth of farmers markets across the Piedmont is certainly a welcomed addition, a food system dependent on a small number of relatively high-priced, geographically distant markets with limited hours lacks the resilience possible in a food system that includes markets characterized by a high diversity of product, price, location, and methods of sale.",

Figure 1 shows the model developed. Dashed boxes, focusing on micro-, small-, and medium-scale aggregators, are assets that could provide opportunities for sale and distribution of local foods from small-and micro-scale producers that currently lack many opportunities for indirect sales of their products. These small-scale aggregators would fill a niche that links a diverse set of producers (part-and full-time, rural and urban) and diverse agricultural products to retail outlets that cater to populations that currently lack access to local food, such as small rural grocers, urban convenience stores, locally owned mid-priced restaurants, and city-and county-managed institutions. Diversifying crops also provides opportunities for consumer access to more diverse produce and other foods, such as culturally important or desired foods.

This led to much public support for getting fresh, local foods into a variety of markets and food access programs. Working with larger farmers and distributors has made a difference in the prevalence of local foods available to consumers. However, smallscale farmers are often not able to sell to these markets. For example, during the 2012-2013 school year, the North Carolina Farm to School Program purchased strawberries from only 7 farms and sweet potatoes from 11 farms. For comparison, there are 4155 North Carolina farms of 1-9 acres identified in the US Department of Agriculture Agricultural Census, who are also potential suppliers for this program (North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services 2014; US Department of Agriculture 2014).

GrowFood Carolina is presented below as a case study of a food hub that is helping the Charleston food system move toward a fledgling level of resilience. GrowFood Carolina provides a model for one of the nodes in Fig. 2 -an aggregation/distribution hub that connects small-scale growers to consumers in the same region. It also has the potential to serve as a central hub networked to smaller aggregation and value-added processing centers throughout the region, like the spokes of a wheel. Charleston, South Carolina is the center of one of the Southeast's real estate development booms, aided by an influx of retirees moving to the area due to its climate and the availability of still-relatively affordable land. Charleston County has grown from 350,000 in 2010 to almost 373,000 in 2013, a 6.5 % increase (US Census 2014). A corollary to the above growth and international recognition for Charleston's reputation is the recent development of a vibrant, local food culture. Green Grocer Farms on Wadmalaw Island, located outside of Charleston is representative of this growing local food culture. In the 1990s, the farm grew a variety of row crops under regional organic certification, which were sold in Savannah and Atlanta. Now, 15 years later, pastured eggs and pastured raw milk are produced, and the farm is unable to keep up with local demand for their products.",

In contrast, high biological diversity has the capacity to decrease risk with genetic diversity within a single crop and through distribution of risk between a variety of products being grown for harvest and sale. These insights should help us think more clearly about what are long-term goals for a truly resilient food system.",

Highly managed, low acreage production systems such as the biointensive technique have shown greater yields per unit area than conventional production systems reliant on larger acreage. These highly managed systems also result in more efficient water use, reduced pest/pathogen pressures, and protection of adjacent environments. Interspersing small farms with large farms and returning some lands to a non-farmed condition to provide localized ecosystem services has the potential to engender social, economic, and environmental resilience through regionally-enhanced, responsive, and more highly-integrated food networks.",

            "text": "Development of small, diverse farming operations can help communities respond to chronic economic stress by providing supplemental income for some growers and opportunities to build larger, full-time farm businesses for others. High-yield, low acreage techniques can also make farming accessible to a diverse community of people who had not been involved with agriculture, such as urban residents, minorities, and women. However, one barrier to small farmers is often inconvenient access to markets for sale of their products. To have a resilient food system, you have to make it economically viable to farm. Therefore, it is crucial to link the shift in food production systems with the shift in food distribution networks.",

            "text": "There is a growing emphasis for the need for new, locally based markets that can be the portal for sale of products by small-scale, locally connected producers. Indeed, several regional food hubs and networks have emerged in the USA that aim to close the gap between producers and consumers. Regional food network and hub models can increase opportunities for direct consumer purchase, or they can serve as aggregation centers for food to be passed into a centralized distribution network, connecting with large volume sellers such as grocery stores, processing facilities, and wholesale distributors. A food system that is predicated upon supporting and cultivating farmers of all scales, who utilize various sustainable production methods for a diversity of crops, and have a variety of market outlets will inevitably be stronger, more resilient, and more adaptable to change than a system that only responds to one scale or type of farmer or one type of market.",
