            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) membrane protein is an abundant virion protein, and its interaction with the nucleocapsid protein is crucial for viral assembly and morphogenesis. Although the interacting region in the nucleocapsid protein was mapped to residues 168-208, the interacting region in the membrane protein and the interaction nature are still unclear. In this work, by using yeast two-hybrid and surface plasmon resonance techniques, the residues 197-221 of the membrane protein and the residues 351-422 of the nucleocapsid protein were determined to be involved in their interaction. Sequence analysis revealed that these two fragments are highly charged at neutral pH, suggesting that their interaction may be of ionic nature. Kinetic assays indicated that the endodomain (aa102-221) of the membrane protein interacts with the nucleocapsid protein with high affinity (K D = 0.55 \u00b1 0.04 M), however, this interaction could be weakened greatly by acidification, higher salt concentration (400 mM NaCl) and divalent cation (50 mM Ca 2+ ), which suggests that electrostatic attraction might play an important role in this interaction. In addition, it is noted that two highly conserved amino acids (L218 and L219) in the membrane protein are not involved in this interaction. Here, we show that electrostatic interactions between the carboxyl termini of SARS-CoV membrane protein and nucleocapsid protein largely mediate the interaction of these two proteins. These results might facilitate therapeutic strategies aiming at the disruption of the association between SARS-CoV membrane and nucleocapsid proteins.",

Both the M and E proteins are essential for coronavirus morphogenesis (de Haan, Kuo, Masters, Vennema, & Rottier, 1998; Vennema et al., 1996) , and interactions between these two proteins seem to drive the coronavirus envelope assembly, thus producing virus-like particles in the absence of other viral components (Escors, Ortego, & Enjuanes, 2001b) . The M protein is able to bind to the nucleocapsid protein in the absence of S and E protein (Narayanan, Maeda, Maeda, & Makino, 2000) , and the M protein binds to nucleocapsid with its carboxyl terminus in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Kuo & Masters, 2002; Narayanan et al., 2000) and transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) (Escors et al., 2001b; Escirs, Ortego, Laude, & Enjuanes, 2001c) . Moreover, two homologous segments, residues 201-224 of MHV M protein and residues 233-257 of TGEV M protein, were mapped to be involved in the M/N protein-protein interaction (Kuo & Masters, 2002) . Recently, SARS-CoV M/N interaction in the absence of viral RNA was validated in vivo through the mammalian two-hybrid system, which reinforced the fact that the M/N interaction makes the formation of the crucial structure for coronavirus (He et al., 2004) . However, the knowledge about this interaction is still limited and more explorations are needed.",

The preparation procedures of the wild type and the mutant of SARS-CoV ME are similar to each other. Here we described the preparation procedure for the wild type as an example. The recombinant plasmid of pET15b-ME was transformed into BL21 (DE3) E. coli bacteria. Clones were grown overnight in LB medium containing 100 mg L \u22121 ampicillin. Expression of the protein was induced at an OD 600 of 0.5-0.7 with addition of isopropyl-\u2424-d-galactoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 0.2 mM.

The lysate was cleared by centrifugation and the supernatant was loaded on a Sepharose Ni-NTA column (Amersham Pharmacia) equilibrated with buffer A. The column was eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole) after being washed by wash buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole). The elution fraction was further applied to a gel filtration column (Hiprep TM 16/60 sephacyl S100) on an FPLC system. The column was pre-equilibrated with HBS buffer (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) before loading the protein sample. ME protein was thus eluted by HBS buffer, and concentrated by Ultrafree4 tube (Milipore Co.) The protein purity was determined by SDS-PAGE and concentration was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm in HBS buffer using the extinction coefficient of 13075 L mol \u22121 cm \u22121 .",

The flow cell immobilized with lysozyme (2200 RU) was used as the negative reference, and all responses on the experimental flow cell were subtracted to the responses on the control flow cell. The interaction between SARS-CoV ME and the immobilized SARS-CoV N protein were shown as in Fig. 4A (gray curves). It is found that the binding response increased from zero up to 700 RU with the increasing ME concentrations from 0 to 5 M, indicating that SARS-CoV ME could bind directly to SARS-CoV N protein. The kinetic parameters for SARS-CoV ME/N interaction (k on and k off ) were successfully determined by evaluating the curves according to the 1:1 Langmuir binding model. The evaluated curves were found to superpose the experimental curves very well (Fig. 4A ) and the reliability of the fitting model could be also reflected by the small residuals (Fig. 4B) . The rate associate (k on ) and dissociate (k off ) constants for this interaction were evaluated as 4.18 \u00b1 0.32 \u00d7 10 3 M \u22121 s \u22121 and 2.23 \u00b1 0.19 \u00d7 10 \u22123 s \u22121 , then K D (K D = k off /k on ) was calculated as 0.55 \u00b1 0.04 M, revealing that SARS-CoV ME binds to SARS-CoV N protein with a high affinity.

SARS-CoV ME/N11 (N4) interactions were studied with the purified N11 and N4 immobilized on the CM5 sensor chip surface. As shown in Fig. 5A , 30 M of SARS-CoV ME showed only 13 RU in response when binding to N4, and 5 M of SARS-CoV ME demonstrated up to 700 RU when binding to the full-length N (Fig. 4A) , this indicated that N4 almost lost the ME-binding capability. By contrast, as shown in Fig. 5B , the immobilized N11 interact with SARS-CoV ME with a high affinity (K D = 0.61 \u00b1 0.06 M) close to that of SARS-CoV ME/N interaction (K D = 0.55 \u00b1 0.04 M). These results thus further proved that the carboxyl terminus of SARS-CoV N protein, residues 341-422 in particular, are critical for SARS-CoV M/N interaction. Moreover, our result also indicated that the reported residues 168-208 (He et al., 2004) might not contribute greatly to SARS-CoV M/N interaction, in accordance with the abovementioned yeast two-hybrid results. In fact, for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and TGEV, their M proteins have been believed to bind to the carboxyl terminuses of the N proteins (Kuo and Masters, 2002) . Although SARS-CoV N shares only little homology with other coronavirus N protein, there might be a general pattern common to all the coronavirus N proteins: the protein is highly basic overall, and there is a concentration of acidic residues in its carboxyl terminal domain (Laude and Masters, 1995) . Thus it is possible that the carboxyl terminus of N protein binding to M protein might be the common feature for coronavirus.",

Then the interaction between ME1 and the immobilized SARS-CoV N was studied on Biacore 3000. The results showed that SARS-CoV ME1/N interaction is very weak (Fig. 6A) . Together with the above-mentioned fact that SARS-CoV ME bind stongly to SARS-CoV N protein (Fig. 4A) , it suggested that residues 197-221 of SARS-CoV M protein were involved in SARS-CoV M/N interaction. To further confirm the contribution of these 25 residues to this interaction, the MCT peptide (RYRIGNYKL-NTDHAGSNDNIALLVQ, residues 197-221 of SARS-CoV M) interaction with the immobilized SARS-CoV N protein was also quantitatively investigated on Biacore 3000. Fig. 6B clearly showed that the MCT peptide could bind to the immobilized SARS-CoV N protein, and the related kinetic parameters could be determined by 1:1 Langmuir binding model as k on = 509 \u00b1 42 M \u22121 s \u22121 , k off = 0.0394 \u00b1 0.002 s \u22121 and K D = 75 \u00b1 5 M. Moreover, the inhibition of the MCT peptide against SARS-CoV ME/N interaction was also studied. In the surface competition assays, 5 M SARS-CoV ME protein was mixed with different concentrations of the MCT peptide before injection. As shown in Fig. 6C , the responses for the mixtures decreased with the increase of the MCT peptide, which thereby suggested that the MCT peptide could inhibit SARS-CoV ME protein binding to the immobilized N protein. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6D , the fact that the control peptide (AGGAGAGGEA) did not interact with the immobilized SARS-CoV N and rendered no effects on SARS-CoV ME/N interaction suggested the specificity of SARS-CoV N/MCT peptide interaction.",

By multiple sequence alignment (Fig. 8A) , we found that in the Cterminus of SARS-CoV M, there was no 'LLR(K)' or 'R(K)LL' motif but a conserved \"LL\". We thereby suspected that L218 and L219 of M protein might also contribute to SARS-CoV M/N interaction.

Furthermore, as indicated by the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 8C) , the double-site mutated SARS-CoV ME showed the similar N protein binding ability to the wild type SARS-CoV ME protein.

SPR kinetic assays revealed that the endodomain (aa102-221) of SARS-CoV M interacts with SARS-CoV N protein with high affinity. This binding affinity, however, could be weakened greatly by acidification, high concentration salt (400 mM NaCl) and divalent cation (50 mM Ca 2+ ), thus suggesting that the electrostatic attraction might play an important role in SARS-CoV M/N interaction. These results clearly showed that SARS-CoV M protein interacts with N protein mostly through their carboxyl termini by electrostatic attraction. According to our results, the residues 168-208 of SARS-CoV N might be involved in but not contribute greatly to SARS-CoV M/N interaction, which seems to be not compatible with the reported result that these residues might be critical for SARS-CoV M/N interaction (He et al., 2004) . While we are preparing this manuscript, Fang et al. published the result that residues 194-205 of SARS-CoV M were involved in SARS-CoV M/N interaction by GST pull-down method (Fang et al., 2005) , this region is within our proved residues 197-221 in SARS-CoV M responsible for binding to SARS-CoV N protein. As discussed above, the electrostatic attraction might play an important role in SARS-CoV M/N interaction, it is thereby suggested that the three basic amino acids, R197, R199 and K204 in the overlapping sequence (aa197-205, RYRIGNYKL) of SARS-CoV M might be responsible for its binding to SARS-CoV N protein. In addition, it is noted that the two highly conserved amino acids (L218 and L219) of SARS-CoV M protein are not involved in SARS-CoV M/N interaction. Our current work will hopefully help understanding the molecular mechanism of SARS-CoV M/N interaction and provide valuable clues for mutagenic studies to disrupt virion assembly.",
