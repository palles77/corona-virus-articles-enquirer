Coronavirus S proteins assemble into homotrimers and this most likely also occurs with the S proteins of toro-and bafiniviruses. The bulbous membrane-distal part of the peplomers, comprising the receptor-binding domains, are largely composed of S1 subunits, whereas the C-terminal S2 subunits form a membraneanchored stalk. Heptad repeat regions in S2 are assumed to drive membrane fusion during entry by undergoing a series of conformational changes culminating in a six-helical bundle.

Sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the conservation of functional domains in the replicase polyproteins is the result of a continuous evolution from a common nidovirus ancestor. Activities and functions have been identified for many of the conserved replicase domains and the corresponding cleavage products. Replicase subunits conserved across all nidoviruses include (from N-to C-terminus): (i) a chymotrypsin-like protease (3C-like or main protease; 3CL pro , M pro ) that is flanked by two hydrophobic transmembrane domains (tm-M pro -tm) in the viral polyprotein and has a substrate specificity resembling that of picornavirus 3C proteases, (ii) a large RdRp, (iii) a 5\ue039-to-3\ue039 helicase domain containing a putative multinuclear Zn-finger-like domain at its N-terminus (Zn-HEL). Some replicase subunits are present only in a subset of nidoviruses. A nidoviral endoribonuclease specific for uridylate (NendoU) was long considered to be shared by all nidoviruses and to represent a unique diagnostic molecular marker that would distinguish the members of this order from all other RNA viruses known to date. However, a very recent study shows roniviruses to lack this domain. A 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN) and ribose-2'-O-methyltransferase (O-MT) are conserved in the large nidoviruses, but not in arteriviruses. An ADP-ribose-1\"-phosphatase (ADRP, also called macrodomain) and a noncanonical \"secondary\" RdRp with possible primase activity (coronavirus nsp8), have been (tentatively) mapped only in members of the family Coronaviridae.

Each carries a short 5\ue039 leader sequence of 55-92, 170-210 nt, and 42 nucleotides, respectively, which is identical to the 5\ue039 end of the viral genome. It was established early on that leader and \"body\" sequences are not joined through splicing, but via a process of discontinuous RNA synthesis. A key observation was the presence of mirror-copy nested sets of sg minus-strand RNAs in corona-and arterivirus-infected cells. Combined experimental evidence from biochemical and reverse genetics analyses indicates that these sg minus-strand RNAs are in fact the templates for sg mRNA synthesis. Replicative intermediates (RI)/replicative forms with sizes corresponding to the different sg mRNAs were shown to be actively involved in transcription. According to the prevailing 3\ue039-discontinuous extension model, the discontinuous step occurs during the production of sg minus-strand RNAs and entails attenuation of RNA synthesis at the TRSs, followed by a similarity-assisted copy choice RNA recombination event. In corona-, arteri-and bafiniviruses, a TRS is present immediately downstream of the genomic leader sequence. It is believed that, during minus-strand RNA synthesis, the replicase complex upon encounter of an internal TRS dissociates from the template and is transferred to the 5\ue039 end of the genome, guided by sequence complementarity between the anti-TRS on the nascent strand and the genomic TRS.

The spike (S) protein induces virus-neutralizing antibodies; sera from BToV-or PToV-infected animals cross-neutralize EToV. Comparative sequence analysis of bovine and porcine torovirus field variants revealed several instances in which coding sequences for the HE ectodomain had been exchanged through intergenotypic homologous RNA recombination. Bovine torovirus variants currently prevalent in the field (genotypes II and III) have apparently arisen from a recombination event during which the ancestral BToV (genotype I) swapped its N gene for that of porcine torovirus.",

For the main bifurcations, support from 100 bootstraps is given. (Sub)families and genera are highlighted and/or labeled. For arteriviruses, the four main clusters, prototyped by EAV, SHFV, LDV and PRRSV (only one of two currently recognized genotypes shown), are indicated. The divisions between large (Coronaviridae, Roniviridae) and small (Arteriviridae) nidoviruses and the one between Corona-and Torovirinae are indicated by black dotted lines.

GP5 of EAV, LDV, and PRRSV are modified by heterogeneous N-acetyl lactosamine addition. Due to extensive and heterogeneous glycosylation, GP5 is of highly variable size (between 26 and 42 kDa).
