We generated live attenuated human influenza A vaccines (LAIVs) by rationally engineering mutations directly into the genome of a pandemic-H1N1 virus. Two LAIVs (NS1-73 and NS1-126) were based on the success of LAIVs for animal influenza A viruses. A third candidate (NS\u03945) is a unique NSmutant that has never been used as a LAIV. The vaccine potential of each LAIV was determined through analysis of attenuation, interferon production, immunogenicity, and their ability to protect mice and ferrets. This study demonstrates that NS\u03945 is an ideal LAIV candidate, provides important information on the effects that different NS mutations have on the pandemic-H1N1 virus and shows that LAIVs can be engineered directly from the genomes of emerging/circulating influenza A viruses.",

            "text": "Influenza A viruses are highly contagious human and animal pathogens in the family Orthomyxoviridae. Annual influenza A epidemics result in 250-500 million infections, which cause 250,000-500,000 fatalities worldwide [1] . The influenza A viral genome is composed of eight negative sense single-stranded RNA segments (vRNAs) that together encode 10-11 proteins [2] . Influenza A virus vaccines have to be updated frequently because of \"antigenic drift\" variants that escape antibody neutralization and rapidly displace the previously circulating strains. We also need to swiftly generate vaccines to combat unpredictable intermittent influenza A virus pandemics (e.g., 1918 (H1N1), 1957 (H2N2), and 1968 (H3N2)), which are caused by \"antigenic shift\" viruses that can emerge from animal reservoirs [3] . An error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, large and diverse viral reservoirs, frequent interspecies transmission, and reassortment of the segmented RNA genome during co-infections are powerful evolutionary mechanisms that make influenza A viruses extremely challenging pathogens to predict or to control with antivirals or vaccines.",

            "text": "The unique influenza A virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic provides the most recent example of the evolution and rapid dissemination of a pandemic virus. In late April 2009, the first H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) isolate was identified at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, and sequence analysis indicated it to be a quadruple reassortant virus. The genomic vRNAs of the H1N1pdm virus were originally derived from North American classical swine viruses (HA, NP, NS), North American human H3N2 viruses (PB1), North American avian viruses (PB2, PA), and Eurasian avian-like swine viruses (NA, M) [4] . Because the H1N1pdm was antigenically distinct from the seasonal H1N1 virus that has circulated in humans since its re-introduction in 1977, there was little pre-existing immunity to the H1N1pdm in the human population, particularly among individuals born after 1950 [5] . Thus, the H1N1pdm virus spread globally, resulting in millions of infections and tens of thousands of deaths [6] . Prior investments in pandemic preparedness provided an increased global capacity for production of large quantities of H1N1pdm vaccines, and the extraordinary efforts of many health care professionals yielded a safe and fairly effective vaccine by the fall of 2009. However, the lack of H1N1pdm vaccine for the first 2009 winter season in the Southern hemisphere and the shortage of vaccine early in the 2009/2010 influenza season in the Northern hemisphere illustrate the need to develop methods to improve influenza A virus vaccine production.",

Both the inactivated vaccines and LAIVs are produced by creating reassortant viruses that generally contain six vRNAs (PB2, PB1, PA, NP, M and NS) from a master donor strain, plus the two glycoprotein vRNAs (HA and NA) from a virus that antigenically matches the strain predicted to circulate in upcoming influenza season (e.g. A/CA/07/2009). The reassortant vaccine seed stocks are prepared using both classical reassortment techniques and increasingly by the use of plasmid-based reverse-genetics. Although reverse genetics has enhanced our ability to generate influenza virus vaccines, the current LAIV and inactivated approaches both require significant lead time for vaccine production, and it is clear that innovative strategies need to be developed and tested in animal models [7;8] .",

The NS1 protein of influenza A virus is a multifunctional protein that plays important roles in virus replication and as potent type I IFN antagonist [10;11] . Mutations and/or deletions in NS1 typically induce stronger IFN responses by the host; those in turn suppress the replication of influenza virus [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] and can enhance immune recognition [15] [16] [17] [18] . Carboxy terminal deletions in the influenza A NS1 protein have been successfully exploited to create experimental LAIVs for avian, equine, and swine influenza A viruses [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . However, some of the ideal NS-based LAIVs (NS-LAIVs) for these animal viruses have different NS1 deletions due to the influence of strain specific variation in the NS gene, virus lineage, and gene constellation. The H1N1pdm is a novel reassortant, and its NS1 protein has unique properties that distinguish it from the NS1 proteins of typical influenza A viruses (e.g., it lacks 11 residues at the C-terminus), so the mutations required to generate the optimal H1N1pdm NS-LAIV candidate were unknown. Therefore, we created a panel of experimental H1N1pdm NS-LAIV candidates that have different deletions in the NS vRNA and analyzed the vaccine potential of each NS-LAIV in vitro and in vivo to identify the best candidate(s).",

All of the NS-LAIV candidates induced high levels of INF-\u03b2 mRNA production, whereas WT induced only low levels of mRNA; the mock-inoculated cells had no detectable mRNA (Fig. 3B) . Quantitative RT-PCR (qRTPCR) was used to further investigate the production of mRNA for type I and III IFNs and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in A549 cells. Compared to the mock-inoculated cells, the WT virus infection induced a 10-fold increase in IFN-\u03b2 mRNA by 12 hpi, while the NS-LAIV candidates induced 100-(NS1-73) to 3,000fold (NS1-126, and NS\u03945) increases (Fig 3C) . qRTPCR analysis of the type III IFN, IFN-\u03bb1 (IL-29) mRNA indicated that the NS-LAIV candidates induced 10,000-to 100,000-fold increases in mRNA by 16 hpi, whereas the WT virus showed only a 100-fold increase (Fig.  3D ). Although WT virus induced a 60-fold increase in the chemokine IP10 (CXCL10), the vaccine candidates induced 1,800-to 10,000-fold increases in IP-10 mRNA (Fig. 3E) . The ISG Mx is important in host resistance to influenza viruses and the production of human MxA was blocked in WT virus-infected cells. In contrast, \u223c100-fold induction of MxA mRNA was observed in cells infected with anyone of the NS-LAIV candidates by 12 hpi (Fig. 3F) . The qRTPCR data (Fig. 3C-F) correlate with the results of the IFN bioassay (Fig.  3A) and with the attenuation of the NS-LAIV candidates seen in a human lung cell line (Fig.  2B) . Nevertheless, the qRTPCR results help to delineate differences in the host response to the various NS-LAIVs. NS1-126 and NS\u03945 consistently induced the greatest host antiviral response. While the induction of IFN and ISG mRNAs by NS1-73 lagged behind the induction by the other NS-LAIVs (Fig. 3C-F, 12 hpi) , it was considerably greater than that of the WT virus.",

Mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 5 TCID 50 of the WT, NS1-73, NS1-126, or NS\u03945 viruses, or were mock-inoculated. Clinical signs of disease such as ruffled fur were observed in mice inoculated with WT virus as early as 2 days post inoculation (dpi) (data not shown). Weight loss became evident at 3 dpi and the mice did not recover until 9 dpi (Fig. 4A) . In contrast, mice inoculated with any one of the vaccine candidates showed no clinical signs of disease and continued to gain weight at the same rate as did the mock-inoculated mice (Fig.  4A) . Students t-test showed that the weight loss caused by WT virus was statistically different from NS\u03945 and the other NS-LAIVs from days 3-to-8 (p < 0.05). Viral titers in the lungs of NS1-73, and NS1-126 infected mice were approximately 100-fold lower than titers from WT virus-infected mice, at all the time points analyzed (1, 2, and 5 dpi) (Fig. 4B) . The titer of the WT virus was significantly higher than any of the NS-LAIVs at 1, 2, and 5 dpi (p < 0.05, students t-test). Notably, the NS\u03945 LAIV was cleared from the mouse lungs very rapidly and the average titers were approximately 100-fold and 50,000-fold lower than the titers of the WT virus at 1 and 2 dpi, respectively (Fig. 4B) . Although there was an average of 10 6 TCID 50 /lung in mice infected by WT virus on day 5 pi, the average NS\u03945-LAIV titer was below the limit of detection. The NS-LAIV candidates also showed 10-to 100-fold lower titers in the upper respiratory tract (Fig. 4C ). The differences observed between the titer of WT virus and the NS-LAIVs in the upper respiratory tract were also statistically significant. For example, comparison of the titers of WT with NS1-126 by students t-test showed that they were significantly different (p \u2264 0.001) at all of the time points examined (Fig. 4C) . Nevertheless, all of the vaccine candidates were detectable through 5 dpi (Fig.  4C) , and this could promote a strong adaptive immune response.",

Intriguingly, virus antigen was detected in all lobes of the lungs of mice inoculated with all of the recombinant viruses except in mice inoculated with NS\u03945. At 2 and 5 dpi NP antigen positive cells that are depicted in Fig. 5D were infrequently detected in mice infected with NS\u03945.",

Microneutralization assays demonstrated that the vaccine candidates elicited neutralizing antibodies in all of the NS-LAIV immunized mice, with the average antibody titer of each group ranging from 300 to 500 at 21 dpi (Fig.  6A ). When the mice were challenged with a lethal mouse-adapted variant of NY1682 (NY1682-MA7) at 30 dpi, each of the NS-LAIV candidates or prior infection by the WT virus protected the mice from the challenge. No disease symptoms were observed in the mice immunized by any of the NS-LAIV candidates or the WT control. In contrast, disease symptoms including ruffled fur, hunched posture, and weight loss were observed in the mock-immunized mice as early as 2 days post challenge (dpc); the symptoms progressed to severe disease, and the animals showed statistically significant (p<0.001, students t-test) weight loss compared to the WT or NS-LAIV immunized mice (Fig. 6B) . The mice became moribund, and succumbed to infection by 5-6 dpc. High titers of virus were also present in the mock-immunized mice at 3 dpc (4\u00d710 7 TCID 50 /ml) and at 6 dpc (1\u00d710 7 TCID 50 /ml) (Fig. 6C) .

In vitro, the NS-LAIV candidates replicated efficiently in canine MDCK cells, which produce type I IFN but lack the ISG Mx [34] . Efficient replication in MDCK cells has important practical implications because this is an approved cell line for production of influenza A virus vaccines. Importantly, pronounced attenuation was observed in the human lung epithelial cell line A549, correlating with the induction of type I IFN and ISGs by the NS-LAIVs, and this is consistent with previous studies showing that influenza A viruses with deleted or truncated NS1 proteins are attenuated in IFN-competent cells [35;36] . The results from the IFN bioassays and RT-PCR analysis show the host innate immune response was induced at much higher levels in the human lung epithelial cells infected with NS1-126 and NS\u03945 than in those infected with the WT H1N1pdm virus. This data also indicates that NS1-126 and NS\u03945 are likely to be strong inducers of IFNs and ISGs in humans and other primates. Stimulation of the innate immune system is a major advantage to the NS-LAIV strategy because this acts as a natural adjuvant and enhances the adaptive immune response of the host [15-18;37] .",

NS\u03945 is a new type of NS-LAIV that has a subtle in-frame deletion (15 nt), which affects both the NS1 (residues 196-200) and NEP (residues 39-43). The NS\u03945 H1N1pdm LAIV was designed to be analogous to a naturally attenuated variant (A/SW/FJ/03) of a normally highly pathogenic H5N1 virus [33] . The NS1 deletion in A/SW/FJ/03 (NS1 residues 191-195) was shown to reduce binding of NS1 to host cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF), reduce NS1 protein stability, and enhance the type I IFN response of an H5N1 virus [33] . Our data prove that deletion of these 15nt in the NS vRNA of the quadruple reassortant H1N1pdm virus also stimulates the host innate immune response (specifically, IFN-\u00df, IFN-\u03bb1, IP10, and MxA), and attenuates this virus. The fact that NS\u03945 attenuates two distantly related influenza A viruses suggests that this region of the NS gene/ protein(s) is a good target for NS-LAIVs against many diverse influenza A viruses and potentially for the development of anti-viral compounds. The role of the deletion of residues 39-43 from NEP has not been elucidated, but the induction of IFN and ISGs by NS\u03945 was similar to, or slightly lower than their induction by NS-126, suggesting that the NEP mutation may also have an attenuating effect, which warrants future investigation. LAIV safety and the potential problems associated with reassortment of LAIVs with other circulating influenza A viruses are also of paramount importance, and are challenges for the experimental approach described in this study. The currently licensed LAIVs have six internal-protein encoding vRNAs derived from the cold-adapted temperature sensitive A/ Ann Arbor/6/1960 master donor strain (ca A/AA/6/60), which is an H2N2 virus that was originally isolated in 1960 and then subjected to many serial passages in vitro [38;39] . This licensed vaccine has many point mutations in multiple vRNAs (e.g., PB1, PB2, NP) [40] [41] [42] that both attenuate the virus and enhance its safety by inhibiting the rapid generation of revertants and/or single-gene reassortants that have lost the attenuating temperature sensitive phenotype, but contain wild-type HA and NA vRNAs. Although the NS-deletions used in this study are large enough so that rapid reversion to a wild-type phenotype via point mutation is highly unlikely, substitution of the NS vRNA segment via reassortment with either wild-type H1N1pdm viruses or other seasonal viruses would remove the single attenuating vRNA. This is a very serious concern, particularly in situations where the emerging strains have pandemic potential but have not yet become widespread. Therefore, we envision swapping the cis-acting segment-specific packaging signals in the vRNA segments such as the HA and NS, which was recently effective with A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) [44] , in order to prevent reassortment and enhance safety of future NS-based LAIVs. Additional animal studies and human trials with specific NS-LAIVs such as the recent study by Wacheck et. al. [43] are needed to help to define safety parameters for NS-LAIVs in humans.",

            "text": "A drawback of using the 6 internal-protein encoding vRNAs of ca A/AA/6/60 is that the cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes present in influenza A virus have mutated because of host immune pressure, which reduces immune recognition of the internal proteins expressed by currently circulating strains [45] [46] [47] [48] . Additionally, many immune evading amino acid substitutions are present when novel reassortants like the H1N1pdm virus emerge from animal reservoirs. Our strategy can be accomplished with equal, or greater, speed than typical reverse-genetics based vaccine approaches, which often require virus isolation prior to RT-PCR amplification with HA and NA specific primers. Most importantly, the LAIV approach outlined in this study has the advantage of stimulating the host's innate and adaptive immune system with the entire repertoire of proteins expressed by circulating or new emerging strains.",

            "text": "In summary, we rapidly generated a panel of recombinant LAIVs, directly from a patient specimen, by introducing attenuating mutations into the NS gene of an emerging pandemic influenza A virus. Our results demonstrate that two deletion mutations (NS1-126 and NS\u03945) in the NS vRNA in the unique gene constellation of the H1N1pdm virus attenuate this virus in a human lung epithelial cell line, in mice and in ferrets. A new type of NS-LAIV (NS\u03945) was designed and shown to be highly attenuated, and to elicit strong innate and adaptive immune responses, resulting in protection of mice from subsequent challenge with a lethal mouse-adapted variant of NY1682, and ferrets from challenge with A/Mexico/4482/2009. The creation of LAIVs by the rational introduction of attenuating mutations to the genome of emerging or currently circulating strains of influenza A virus could be integrated with current and future vaccine production scheme(s) and it has important potential advantages over the reassortant-based vaccine seed stock production strategies that are currently used. 6 week-old female BALB/cJ mice were inoculated intranasally with 10 5 TCID 50 of WT, the NS-LAIVs, or were mock inoculated. (A) Body weight of inoculated mice (n=12/group) was recorded daily and is represented as the percent of the animals weight on the day of inoculation (day 0). (B) Viral titers in the lung homogenates of inoculated mice (n=6/group) were determined for each mouse by TCID 50 assay at 1, 2, and 5 dpi. (C) Viral titers from nasal airway of inoculated mice (n=9/group). The average of each group is shown with error bars determined by SEM, and the limit of detection for virus titration is indicated by the dotted line (B, C). ",

NS1 protein is directly translated from the full length mRNA and is shown on the top of the gene; NEP protein is translated from spliced mRNA and is illustrated below the gene. Selected amino acid positions are labeled for NS1 and NEP. LAIV candidates NS1-73, NS1-126 express truncated NS1 but intact NEP; NS\u03945 expresses NS1 and NEP proteins each having a five amino acid in-frame deletion.
