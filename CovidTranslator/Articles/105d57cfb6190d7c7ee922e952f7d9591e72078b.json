The sensing signals were the drain current change of the HEMTs induced by the protein-dsDNA binding. Binding-site models using surface coverage ratios were utilized to analyze the signals from the HEMT-based sensors to extract the dissociation constants and predict the number of binding sites. Two dissociation constants, K D1 = 0.0955 nM, K D2 = 51.23 nM, were obtained by fitting the experimental results into the two-binding-site model. The result shows that this technique is more competitive than isotope-labeling electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). We demonstrated that AlGaN/GaN HEMTs were highly potential in constructing a semiconductor-based-sensor binding assay to extract the dissociation constants of nucleotide-protein interaction.",

More than 8000 probable infected cases and 774 deaths were reported worldwide ranging 29 countries, according to World Health Organization (WHO) [1] . This disease is caused by the SARS coronavirus. A coronavirus protein, nucleocapsid protein (N protein), encapsidates the coronavirus genomic RNA playing an important role in the virus replication. SARS-N protein has been shown its capability of interacting with RNA and DNA, and therefore is known as a nucleic acid binding protein [2] [3] [4] [5] . Investigating the nucleotide-SARS-N protein interaction can help us to explore the virus genome packaging process to construct a genome packaging model for SARS coronavirus. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and filter binding assay have been widely used to study protein-nucleic acid interaction in the last 30 years [6] [7] [8] [9] . However, these two methods require labeling of fluorescent probes or isotope elements on nucleic acids to provide signals for quantitative molecule detection. Thus, the cost for these methods is high, and the labeling may alter the binding affinity of molecules. Developing an efficient and molecule-labeling free binding assay with low cost and high sensitivity becomes a very important issue.",

The AlGaN/GaN HEMT sensors have shown high sensitivity due to the high concentration of twodimensional electron gas induced by the piezoelectric polarization of the strained AlGaN layer and the spontaneous polarization [10, 15, 17] . The gate region of the HEMTs can be modified or immobilized with various sensing materials to interact with analytes, which result in potential change on gate area leading to the current change of transistors. Gallium nitride (GaN) is thermally stable because of the wide-bandgap property. Devices made of GaN can operate up to 500 \u2022 C. GaN is also chemically stable. Most acids and bases cannot etch GaN in regular condition. Only molten NaOH or KOH is known to be able to etch GaN. Therefore GaN-based sensors are particularly suitable for detection with salt, ions, chemicals, or biomolecules in liquid. The AlGaN/GaN HEMT-based sensors are excellent candidates for detection under harsh environments such as in buffered solution, serum, or in sea. In addition to the good thermal and chemical stability, the AlGaN/GaN HEMT has advantages such as real-time detection, fast response, high sensitivity, small size, light-weight, low cost and good reliability. These advantages ensure the AlGaN/GaN HEMT-based sensors to be an excellent platform to investigate the binding affinity of ligand-receptor complexes.",

            "text": "The AlGaN/GaN HEMTs are not only can be used as biosensors to detect various biomolecules, but can also be used to study the binding affinity of ligand-receptor complexes. The ligand-receptor pairs may include antigen-antibody, DNA-DNA, protein-DNA, protein-RNA, protein-protein, drug-protein, or substrate/inhibitor-enzyme systems. On the gate region of the HEMT sensors, receptors are usually immobilized to detect the ligand concentration in the bulk solution. The sensing mechanism is through the ligand-receptor affinity, which can be quantitatively expressed as equilibrium constant (affinity constants) or dissociation constants. Besides, a receptor may bind with more than one ligand, and each binding site on the receptor may have a unique dissociation constant with the ligand. With a quantitative analysis of the signals from the sensors through binding-site models, we are able to reveal how many binding sites are on the receptor (dsDNA) for certain ligands (SARS-N protein) and what the dissociation constants are for ligand-receptor complexes. Due to the fast response and low price of the AlGaN/GaN HEMT sensors, the analysis can be quickly done and the information about the ligand-receptor binding affinity can be obtained with very low expenses. Conventional methods to study ligand-receptor interactions also include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [18] , isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) [19, 20] , ultra-violet/visible light (UV/VIS) spectrum [21] , surface plasmon resonance (SPR) [22, 23] , total internal reflection ellipsometry (TIRE) [24] , and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [25] . Typically, ELISA and UV/VIS spectrum require labeling probes. ITC usually needs a large amount of sample. The commercial equipment (BIAcore) utilizing SPR technology has been used to characterize binding affinity of ligand-receptor complexes [17] . However, the equipment is expensive and therefore the cost for research is high. TIRE or HPLC also have good performances, but their prices are much higher than that of AlGaN/GaN HEMT sensors. In sharp contrast, the AlGaN/GaN HEMT sensors can achieve very good performances as the above mentioned while in the meantime keep a very low cost for research.",

Real-time current monitoring spanned the range of protein concentrations from 0.003 nM to 3000 nM, and showed saturation as the concentration of N protein larger than 300 nM. The current drop for different protein concentration was due to the binding between the protein and the dsDNA on the gate region of the transistor, resulting in the change of the surface potential on the gate region, leading to the drain current drop.

The equation is shown as [R] max = [R] + [RL]. Fig. 4(b) shows the curve of surface coverage ratio from Eq. (5) using the dissociation constant extracted from Fig. 4(a) and the I/ I max obtained from the experimental results shown as dots versus the ligand concentration in log scale. It is obvious that the curve of the surface coverage ratio does not match well with those experimental dots. From Eq. (5), it is shown that the surface coverage ratio actually depends on the ratio of dissociation constant to the concentration of ligand, that is K D /[L]. When K D equals 10 folds or 10% of [L], the surface coverage ratio goes to around 9.09% and 90.91%, respectively. Beyond 90.91% or below 9.09% of the surface coverage ratio, increasing or decreasing the concentration of antigen does not change the surface coverage ratio much. Therefore, we conclude that for a one-binding-site model, the most significant change of the surface coverage ratio is within the range of the ligand concentration between one order higher and one order lower than the value of the dissociation constant. This was also shown by experimental data in literature [29] . Thus, ideally once the dissociation constant is determined, the highest sensitivity for the sensor is only within this two-order range of ligand concentration. On the other hand, for any experimental result, the surface coverage ratio between 9.09% and 90.91% should only cover two orders of ligand concentration for an ideal one-binding-site model. However, in Fig. 4(b) , it is significant that between 9.09% and 90.91% of the surface coverage, the experimental data points cover more than 3 orders of the ligand concentration. Therefore, it is not possible to fit these experimental points well into the surface coverage ratio with the one-binding-site model. The wide range of the ligand concentration within that coverage ratio (9.09-90.91%) may be resulted from multiple binding sites of the receptor. Compared with Fig. 4(a) , Fig. 4(b) is clearly more sensitive to see whether the onebinding-site model can really fit into the experimental data. Thus, the surface coverage ratio versus the ligand concentration will be used for finding out the number of binding sites and the associated dissociation constants. Here a two-binding-site model is proposed as the following.",

The experimental data points nicely fit into the two-binding-site model. Two dissociation constants, (K D1 = 0.0955 nM, K D2 = 51.23 nM, c 1 = 0.7506, and c 2 = 0.2494) were extracted from the two-binding-site model. The correlation coefficient r 2 is 0.988. This result suggests that there are at least two SARS-N protein-CTD binding on the dsDNA. It was not reported the dissociation constants between the dsDNA and the SARS-N protein-CTD. However, it was observed in literature [5] that both RNA and dsDNA have very strong binding with the SARS-N protein-CTD, while the ssDNA has weaker binding compared with RNA and the dsDNA. RNA aptamer was reported to have a dissociation constant as 0.8 nM when binding to the SARS-N protein-CTD [31] . There is only single dissociation constant obtained due to the extraction of the dissociation constant simply from a one-bindingsite system. The value of the dissociation constant for RNA from the literature [31] is just between our K D1 and K D2 . Since both dsDNA and RNA have strong binding affinity with the SARS-N protein-CTD, we believe that the values of our dissociation constants are in a reasonable range. In another literature, ssDNA aptamer was reported to have dissociation constant as 4.9 nM when binding to the SARS-N protein-CTD [32] . Although the sequence of the RNA aptamer and the ssDNA aptamer is different from ours, the values of the reported dissociation constants are consistent with our results. Our results are obtained based on dealing with the whole system with full spectrum of the protein concentration.",

To investigate that possibility, three-binding-site model was used to fit the experimental data, and it looks like the fitting is also very nice, as shown in Appendices A and B. However, we can easily find that for the three dissociation constants extracted from the three-binding-site model, the K D2 and the K D3 are very close, and their values are almost the same as the K D2 extracted from the twobinding-site model. Needless to say, the K D1 extracted from the three-binding-site model is almost the same as the K D1 extracted from the two-binding-site model. We therefore can conclude that if two-binding-site model can be well fitted with the experimental data, it is not necessary to try with higher number of binding-site model. The methodology that we adopt in the analysis of the dissociation constants and the number of binding sites in this research mainly relies on the full range of the protein concentration, from low surface coverage to full saturation, which allows us to see the whole response for full range of the protein concentration. This is a very important key to investigate the complete information about the affinity between the protein and the dsDNA. If the sensor was only tested with a small range of the protein concentration, but not the full range until saturation, then the information about the number of binding sites and the dissociation constants extracted from the curve-fitting technique may be misled into wrong results and conclusion. We found that for some researches the range of the ligand concentration is sometimes ignored. To investigate the full range of the ligand concentration, the model that utilizes the surface coverage ratio is very successful to handle such many orders of magnitude of the ligand concentration. Therefore, the binding-site model using the surface coverage ratio together with the HEMTs becomes a simple and useful tool for the analysis of the binding affinity between the SARS-N-protein and dsDNA.",
