As the SARS-CoV-2 entry receptor, ACE2 is widely expressed in multiple organs5  , we postulated that in certain types of cells infected by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, virus replication is incompletely suppressed even after clinical recovery for unknown reasons, resulting in the disconnectedly shedding of trace amount of zombie virus post-discharge. Therefore, our result indicated that the detectable viral genome in discharged patients only means the presence of viral fragments and that an infection origin could hardly form for its extremely low concentration.
