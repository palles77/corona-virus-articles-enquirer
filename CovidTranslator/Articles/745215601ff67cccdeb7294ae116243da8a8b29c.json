We examined whether the MxA polymorphisms were related to the risk and severity of enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection in Chinese populations. The MxA C-123A and G-88T polymorphisms were genotyped in two independent case-control populations in China by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). MxA messenger RNA was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from 45 healthy children and 19 patients with EV71 infection. Significantly decreased susceptibility to EV71 infection was observed for the -123A allele and -88T allele carriers, with ORs (95 % CIs) estimated as 0.56 (0.39-0.81) and 0.64 (0.47-0.88), respectively, in the 1 3 family. EV71 has been regarded as the most important neurotropic enterovirus after the primary eradication of the poliovirus. There is no specific antiviral therapy or vaccine for EV71. Since its discovery in 1969, EV71 outbreaks have been reported periodically throughout the world. The size and frequency of EV71 outbreaks have greatly increased over the past decade in the Asia-Pacific region, especially in southeast Asia (Solomon et al. 2010) . In mainland China, EV71 infection has become more and more severe and led to 509 and 569 deaths in 2011 and 2012, respectively, according to the report of Ministry of Health, China.",

Similar to other infectious diseases, EV71 infection may also be the result of complex interactions between pathogen, environmental factors and host genes.

The Myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are dynamin-like GTPases that are induced by IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 and have antiviral activity against RNA viruses (Sadler and Williams 2008) . In humans, two distinct Mx (MxA and MxB) are encoded on chromosome 21, while only MxA has exhibited antiviral activity (Sadler and Williams 2008) . Transfected cells (Chieux et al. 2001; Kochs and Haller 1999) and transgenic mice (Pavlovic et al. 1995) overexpressing MxA acquire a high degree of antiviral resistance against several RNA viruses. In humans, synthesis of MxA protein is induced during viral infections and may protect humans from infection (Roers et al. 1994; von Wussow et al. 1990 ). As for EV71, it has been shown that type I IFN subtypes can inhibit EV71 replication and the antiviral effect was caused by a strong induction of the downstream antiviral effectors especially MxA (Yi et al. 2011 ). On the basis of the functional role of MxA in the pathogenesis of viral infections in vivo and in vitro, we hypothesize that MxA might be a potential candidate susceptibility gene for EV71 infection.",

The electrophoretic mobility shift assays shown that these two polymorphisms could influence the binding of nuclear protein(s) (Ching et al. 2010) . Furthermore, by luciferase reporter assay, the basal promoter activity was demonstrated to be higher in promoter constructs containing the minor alleles of the two polymorphisms (Furuyama et al. 2006; Hijikata et al. 2001; Torisu et al. 2004 ). We and other investigators have reported the association between the aforementioned MxA functional SNPs and risk of infections of viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Ching et al. 2010; Hamano et al. 2005; He et al. 2006) , hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Cao et al. 2009 ), hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Hijikata et al. 2000) and measles virus (Torisu et al. 2004) . The role of the MxA polymorphisms in EV71 infection, however, has never been investigated. In the present study, we examined whether polymorphisms in the MxA gene were related to the risk and severity of EV71 infection among Chinese populations.",

Furthermore, consistent with the results of population-based association study, higher MxA messenger RNA levels in IFN\u03b21a-stimulated PBMCs from the -123A or -88T allele carriers were observed. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report a genetic association between MxA and susceptibility to EV71 infection, confirming the initial hypothesis that MxA may play a role in the pathogenesis of this disorder. The genetic association between MxA polymorphism and EV71 infection is biologically plausible. MxA is an antiviral protein induced by type I IFNs that can inhibit viral replication. Following stimulation with type I IFNs, MxA protein accumulates to high levels in the cytoplasm on intracellular membranes. At the point of infection, MxA are released and bind viral nucleocapsids or other viral components, to trap and then degrade them (Sadler and Williams 2008) . With regard to EV71, it has been shown that the superior anti-EV71 effect of type I IFN was caused by a strong induction of the downstream antiviral effectors, especially MxA (Sadler and Williams 2008) . In addition, Fig. 2 Quantitative real-time RT-PCR for MxA in healthy children. Expression of MxA for three different genotypes of C-123A and G-88T was measured in RNA from 45 healthy children (20 from the northern population and 25 from the southern population) stimulated with IFN\u03b21a. Normalization for mRNA quantity was performed with human GAPDH control primers for each sample and final abundance figures adjusted to yield an arbitrary value of 1 for -123CC or -88GG genotype. Columns mean from triplicate measurements; the vertical bars indicate the standard deviation (SD). a Correlation of MxA mRNA expression with C-123A genotypes in the northern population.

The subjects that are homozygous for the major C-123A and G-88T haplotype (CC/GG) had lower levels of MxA mRNA than subjects that are heterozygous (CA/GT) (t test; P < 0.05) it has recently been reported that the antiviral activity of MxA extended to coxsackieviruses B virus, a member of the enterovirus family (Chieux et al. 2001) . Thus, it is highly possible that MxA can bind to the components of EV71 and exert its role as an antivirus, although additional studies are needed to clarify this possibility.",

Furthermore, the C-123A and G-88T polymorphisms are in strong LD and the A -123 -T -88 haplotype displays higher promoter activity compared with the C -123 -G -88 haplotype in luciferase reporter assay (Furuyama et al. 2006; Hijikata et al. 2001; Torisu et al. 2004 ). In the present study, we also detected higher MxA transcription in IFN\u03b21a-stimulated PBMCs from the -123A or -88T allele carriers. Given the well-characterized antiviral role of MxA, one might expect that individuals who carry the -123A and/or -88T alleles, and thus have increased expression of MxA, may be at a lower susceptibility to EV71 infection.",

Although administration of type I IFN can inhibit EV71 replication in vitro and in mouse model, a recent study found that EV71 inhibits the expression of IFN-\u03b2 in infected cells (Lei et al. 2010) , which suggests that the virus evades the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2. As the C-123A polymorphism affects basal MxA expression without IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 induction, whereas the G-88T polymorphism influenced MxA expression after IFN-\u03b2 stimulation, the C-123A SNP probably exerts greater effect on basal MxA expression in innate immune response against EV71, in which endogenous IFN induction is suppressed. In addition, we found markedly elevated MxA transcription in response to IFN\u03b21a stimulation for genotypes of the G-88T polymorphism, while the response is not so marked for the C-123A polymorphism. Our results are also consistent with previous findings that the C-123A polymorphism plays a more important role in modifying basal MxA expression, and contributes more significantly to the innate immune response against SARS (Ching et al. 2010) .",
