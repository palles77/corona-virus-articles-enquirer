The airborne viruses were collected on heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) filters in an experimental apparatus and also sampled upstream of these test filters using AGI-30 and BioSampler impinger samplers. To study the effects of relative humidity (RH) on TGEV collection by the filters and samplers, the virus was nebulized into air at 30, 50, 70, and 90% RH. There were no significant changes in virus titer in the nebulizer suspension before and after nebulization for either nebulizer at any of the pressures utilized. Aerosolization efficiency -the ratio of viable virus sampled with impingers to the quantity of viable virus nebulizeddecreased with increasing humidity. BioSamplers detected more airborne virus than AGI-30 samplers at all RH levels. This difference was statistically significant at 30 and 50% RH. Nebulizer type and pressure did not significantly affect the viability of the airborne virus. Virus recovery from test filters relative to the concentration of virus in the nebulizer suspension was less than 10%. The most and the least virus were recovered from filter media at 30% and 90% RH, respectively. The results suggest that TGEV, and perhaps other coronaviruses, remain viable longer in an airborne state and are sampled more effectively at low RH than at high humidity.",

Particles the size of single viruses will be captured primarily by Brownian diffusion (Lee and Liu 1982) . However, few studies have measured the collection efficiency of filters challenged by virus particles.

Although the value of c decreased from 1.11 at 7 psi to 0.86 at 15 psi, changes in c with pressure were not significant (P = 0.57).

At 30 and 50% RH, the difference was statistically significant at P = 0.049 and P < 0.001, respectively. This suggests that, relative to AGI-30 samplers, BioSamplers may have a higher physical sampling efficiency for the TGEV-containing particles and/or sample in a way that reduces inactivation of TGEV. Our finding of higher virus levels measured with the BioSampler for the coronavirus TGEV is, in general, opposite the results reported by Hogan et al. (2005) showing higher airborne concentrations measured using the AGI-30 for MS2 and T3 bacteriophages. However, our aerosolization efficiency was similar to those of reoviruses nebulized using a Chicago atomizer without prehumidification of secondary air (Adams et al. 1982) . These authors also found that aerosolization efficiencies increased by approximately tenfold following the prehumidifying of the secondary air in the Chicago atomizer.",

The authors were careful to note that vaccinia strains are more robust than many other viruses. When Agranovski et al.

If it were possible, higher titers in the nebulizer suspension might have yielded quantifiable concentrations of TGEV in the samplers. However, our methods were optimized to produce titers that were as high as possible for TGEV propagated in ST cells. The inability to quantify TGEV in the samples may be caused primarily by inactivation during travel through the air and during sampling. In addition, the recovery calculated in Eq. 3 may also be inaccurate because the size-selective sampling efficiency of AGI-30 samplers and BioSamplers is low for particles the size of individual viruses (Hogan et al. 2005) Fig. 2 Aerosolization efficiency, g A from Eq. 2, as a function of relative humidity (RH) measured using the AGI-30 all-glass impinger (AGI) and the BioSampler (BIO). Error bars represent \u00b1 1 SD from the mean for each condition Aerobiologia (2007) 23:239-248 245 and the size distribution of the TGEV-containing particles being sampled is not known. Figure 3 shows the results for virus recovery according to Eq. 4 as a function of RH. Overall recovery was less than 10%. Potential reasons for recoveries less than 100% include (1) inactivation during nebulization, (2) inactivation during transport through the air, (3) inactivation during collection and retention on the test filter, and (4) penetration through the test filter. Because nebulization losses were shown to be minimal and the filters tested in this study were fairly efficient, most losses are probably due to inactivation during transport or during collection and/or retention on the test filter. The results in Table 2 and Fig. 3 suggest that Eq. 4 is a more useful expression for evaluating TGEV recovery from filters than Eq. 3.",

Although the reasons for this behavior are uncertain, they may be related to TGEV's structure. In general, influenza virus survives best at low RH and low temperature (Loosli et al. 1943; Hemmes et al. 1962) . Reoviruses show the least airborne viability near 50% RH (Adams et al. 1982) , while bacteriophage MS2 Virus recovery from filters relative to nebulizer titers, R n from Eq. 4, as a function of relative humidity (RH). Error bars represent \u00b1 1 SD from the mean for each condition aerosolized from 0.1 M NaCl was found to have the least relative recovery near 70% RH (Trouwborst and De Jong 1973) . Unlike coronaviruses such as TGEV and influenza viruses, neither reoviruses nor MS2 have an envelope. Our results, combined with those just mentioned, suggest that enveloped viruses may be equipped to survive more effectively at low RH than at high RH, whereas non-enveloped viruses may behave differently. Trouwborst and De Jong (1973) suggested that the inactivation of airborne virus is related to the airwater interface and that this may be an important mechanism for lipid-containing viruses like TGEV. Many biological materials are hygroscopic and demonstrate hysteresis in their water sorption isotherms. Following wet dissemination, the rate of desiccation depends on the prevailing RH. The most portable target molecules of RH stress are outer membrane phospholipids and proteins (Cox 1989 ). This mechanism may partly explain the sensitivity of TGEV to relative humidity.",

Titration of TGEV in an aqueous suspension before and after the suspension was nebulized indicated that the act of nebulization did not inactivate the virus. Not surprisingly, our results indicate that neither the type of nebulizer, the pressure of the air supplied to the nebulizer, nor the duration of nebulization affected the viability of TGEV significantly. Virus recoveries calculated based on the amount of the TGEV-containing suspension nebulized (R n ) showed a dependence on RH, with higher virus recovery at 30% RH than at higher humidities. The reason for this behavior is uncertain, but the results are consistent with those of previous investigations and suggest that enveloped viruses have a different relationship between virus recovery and humidity than non-enveloped viruses. Aerosolization efficiencies were also higher at lower RH, and BioSamplers collected airborne TGEV viruses at a significantly higher efficiency than AGI-30 samplers at 30 and 50% RH. All of the results reported here are specific to TGEV, and the extent to which these results with TGEV apply to other coronaviruses like the SARS virus has not yet been tested. However, TGEV's behavior is likely to be comparable to that of other coronaviruses due to structural similarities. Other viruses, particularly those from other genera, may behave differently.",
