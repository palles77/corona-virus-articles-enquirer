Homology analysis of the sequences of S1 genes of the 19 isolates and 37 reference IBV strains revealed that the identity of the nucleotides and amino acid sequences of the S1 genes between the 15 LX4-type isolates and other IBV strains were 71.9-99.3% and 72.1-99.1%, respectively, while those of the analyzed IBV of LX4 type were 96.0-99.9% and 94.3-99.8%, respectively. The results from this study and other published results in the GenBank database showed that isolates circulating in Sichuan province in recent years were mainly LX4 genotype, which is the predominant genotype circulated in China in recent years.",

The disease affects chickens of all ages, causes respiratory and nephritic syndromes in broilers, and reduces egg production in layers and breeders. The etiologic agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the family Coronaviridae and genus Coronavirus, replicating primarily in the respiratory tract and also in some epithelial cells of the gut, kidney, and oviduct. Currently, dozens of serotypes and genotypes of IBV have been detected, and many more will be reported in the future. Natural outbreaks of IBV are often the result of infections with strains that differ serologically from the vaccine strains [2, 3] , and the antigenicity of IBV was constantly evolving.",

The protease cleavage motifs are usually associated with one or more pairs of basic amino acids (e.g., Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg M41) [9] .

In addition, the S1 protein N-terminus plays an important role in tissue tropism and the degree of virulence of the virus. It is well known that the S1 subunit is highly variable; insertions and deletions can be introduced into the viral genome by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases which lack proofreading capabilities, and by genetic recombination which occurs via a genomic templateswitching mechanism [12] . This has led to the continuous emergence of new IBV serotypes or variants, and has complicated the design of appropriate control programs. Serotypes and genotypes are usually used to character IBV strains. Traditionally, VN and HI tests were used to differentiate and classify IBV strains [13, 14] , and monoclonal antibodies have been developed against several serotypes of IBV [15] [16] [17] , although serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies are only available for a small number of serotypes. In recent researches, S1 gene sequencing and subsequent genetic analysis have provided a fast and accurate method for classifying and predicting IBVs [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] .",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is currently one of the important contagious diseases in poultry production. It not only causes the death of birds, but also causes the chicken to be more sensitive to other pathogens such as E. coli. It can also interfere with the immunization of NDV lentogenic vaccine strain such as Lasota. Immunization failure has frequently occurred and caused severe economic losses in recent years in China, though vaccines such as H120, H52, Ma5, 28/86, and W93 were widely used in flocks. The reason for immune failure is the poor cross-protection between field virus and vaccine strain and the frequent emergence of new variants, and so antigenic characterization of IBV isolates from the recent outbreaks in a region or country is important for selecting the appropriate vaccines and developing new vaccines for the corresponding geographical regions. IBV strains can be classified into dozens of serotypes by VN test and HI test [3, 14, 24] ; subtypes also existed in some serotypes by VN analysis. RT-PCR and sequencing or restriction endonuclease (RE) analysis of S1 gene to characterize IBVs is now increasing [21, 22] . Sequence analysis of field strains has also suggested that the evolution of IBV involves recombination [25] [26] [27] . IBV isolates with S gene of very similar sequence can vary substantially in other parts of the genome, and so isolates of the same serotype could belong to different genotypes. Monoclonal antibodies have been developed against several serotype of IBV [15, 28] , which can be used to characterize the VN epitopes [17] , analyze the antigenic difference of IBVs [16] , and cause development of antibody-based blocking of competition ELISA [29] .",

The phylogenetic results showed that the 19 isolates were grouped into four genotypes, but most of the IBV isolates in this study belonged to the LX4 type or QXIBV (15 out of 19). LX4 was isolated by Liu and Kong in 1999 in Xinjiang [18] , while QXIBV was isolated by Wang in 1997 in Qingdao, China [30] . In addition, two other IBV strains isolated in Sichuan in 2005 and 2007 were also included in this genotype [20] . However, IBV strains CK/CH/LSC/95I, CK/CH/LSC/99I, SC021202, DY04, and CQ04-1 isolated in Sichuan or Chongqing between 1995 and 2004 were grouped into CK/CH/LSC/99I type. One isolate, CK/CH/SCYA/10I was grouped in J2-type, and two isolates, CK/CH/SCNC/08I and CK/CH/SCSN/10I, were grouped in mass-type, but CK/CH/SCNC/08I was H120-like strain as it showed 99.8% similarity of nucleotide sequence to H120 strain. Remarkably, one IBV strain of TW-type CK/CH/SCMY/10I was isolated, which had not been reported in the mainland of China so far-how did this happen was an enigma. The results from this study and other published results in the GenBank database showed that LX4 genotype has become the prevalent genotype circulated in vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks in recent years since 2005 in Sichuan province, China. Furthermore, the incidence of LX4-or QX-type IB have been reported in other areas outside China, such as Europe, Africa, and Japan, and the prevalence has been increasing [31] [32] [33] . The IBV vaccine strains commercially applied at present in China were correlative mainly with the Massachusetts, such as H120, H52, and 28/86, but it induced poor protection against virulent IBV isolates of different genotypes [34] , indicating that vaccines developed from LX4 genotype may be a better choice to control the IBV infections in China.",

Serotype differences of IBVs generally correlated with variations in the HVR of the S1 protein [36, 37] , but the significance of HVR in IBV pathogenicity is not clear yet. The unique discontinuous transcription system and the viral polymerase ''jumping'' possibly contribute to the high RNA recombination frequency in IBVs; Simplot analysis and multiple genes, phylogenetic analysis have been used to detect the recombination events [26] .",

The low nucleotides and amino acids identities between the vaccines and the LX4-type isolates may explain why immune failure and outbreak of IB frequently occurred in recent years in commercial flocks. Furthermore, this study suggested the necessity of developing new vaccine strains derived from LX4 genotype. As new genotypes or variant strains may emerge in the future, Fig. 2 Sequence alignment of S1 amino acid sequences of 40 IBV strains. Dot indicates amino acid identical to that of H120 strain. Dash indicates amino acid deletion in comparison with H120 strain.

HVR represent hypervariable region constant surveillance of new IBV strains is necessary to reveal the molecular character of epidemic IBV strains and to develop better control program of IB in poultry flocks.",
