Onset of resistance normally becomes evident by the 10th day when inoculation is made with 10 5 pfu or less . The resistance could be abrogated in 15 day old animals by increasing the dose two-fold, but with rare exceptions, in 35 day old rats an 80-fold increase in pfu fails to surmount resistance . However, treatment with the immunosuppressant drug cyclosporin A (CsA) abolished resistance, whereby rats challenged at 35 days of age were susceptible to JHMV . The histopathological evidence and disease symptoms in the CsA treated group resembled closely those observed in our previous study with athymic, nude rats . Microscopic examination of the CNS from untreated, infected rats revealed extensive inflammatory responses characterized by perivascular cuffing and mononuclear infiltrates into the neuropile . The parallel CsA treated group showed that inflammatory responses of this type in the CNS were either minimal or absent . From the present evidence, we conclude that JHMV infection, which involves both neuronal and oligodendrocytic elements, is kept in check by the cellular immune system . When cellular immunity is suppressed or absent the disease process is altered from one in which white matter demyelination predominates to another form of disease in which neuronal involvement is prominent .",

When older pre-weanling rats are challenged, a delayed, chronic disease frequently develops, which is characterized by progressive paralysis and presence of extensive lesions in the white matter .` In Wistar Lewis (WL) as well as several outbred rat strains tested by us, animals become resistant to JHMV by about 34 the 10th day of life, whereas Wistar Furth (WF) rats remain susceptible to the virus until weaning, about 21 days after birth .\"' We hypothesized that these age-related differences between the WL and WF strains may be connected with dissimilar growth rates and maturation of the CNS .' -8 This idea is supported by in vitro studies which demonstrated that a relationship exists between oligodendrocyte differentiation/ maturation and resistance to infection by JHMV . 9`0 Another factor controlling neurological disease induced in rats by JHMV is cellular immunity . Rats either immunosuppressed with cyclosporin A (CsA) or genetically athymic remain susceptible to the infection beyond the normal age of resistance, even well past weaning . 4 To further clarify the role of JHMV and the cellular immune system, in this study we examined the influence of inoculum size, age and CsA immunosuppression on the disease process .",

To examine whether resistance prior to and after weaning can be overcome by increasing the virus dose, we challenged one group of 16 day old animals (group 2a in Table 1 ) with 105 pfu, another at 15 days of age (group 3a) with 2x10' pfu and a third 35 day old group (4a) with 8x 105 pfu . It is evident from the data in Table 1 that only one of the eight rats in group 2a developed neurological symptoms whereas five of the seven rats in group 3a, receiving five times more virus at about the same age as 2a, became diseased . Among 4a animals challenged with 8x105 pfu JHMV when 35 days old, only one out of 11 developed a late onset, progressive, paralytic disease of the type described by us previously . 2 It is apparent from these data that at 15 days of age inoculation i .c . of about five to 10 times more virus than the standard dose of 5x10' pfu may be sufficient to overcome resistance . However, by 35 days, 80 times greater JHMV inocula very occasionally surmounted resistance of WL rats .",

Data from the present study revealed that CsA treatment abrogated the normal age-related resistance to JHMV of rats challenged on the tenth, 16th and 35th day of age (Table 1) . However, to be effective the drug had to be administered 2 days ahead of the virus inoculation and continually thereafter, as with rats in group 2b of Table 1 . When initiation of CsA treatment was delayed until 10th day after injection of virus, as in group 2c, or until the 14th day, as in group 4c, or when treatment around the time of inoculation was terminated and not resumed, as in group 4d, no disease developed presumably because resistance was maintained .

Occurrence of necrotic lesions, albeit small, in the white matter, indicates that oligodendrocytes and perhaps other non-neuronal cell types may also be affected .

Undoubtedly, this was progeny virus because the infectiousness of the inoculum is rapidly eclipsed to undetectable levels . However, the infectious potential of the inoculum has to be maintained in the brain for the virus to become subsequently triggered into productive replication, which occurs very often in immunosuppressed rats and rather infrequently in untreated animals . From studies with normal WF rats, there is evidence that latency with JHMV occasionally can be very prolonged, whereby virus expression in the CNS is detectable beyond 138 days after i .c . inoculation .\" The initial period of a few days around the time of inoculation must be critical for establishing the latent virus reservoir because immunosuppression with CsA has to be in effect during this decisive interval .",

Occurrence of prominent inflammatory responses in the form of perivascular cuffing and monocytic cell infiltrates into the neuropile, reported previously by others, 16-19 and noted here is consistent with the autoimmune mechanism of demyelination . However, the similarity in the paralytic disease, with predominantly white matter demyelination, which develops in WL and WF rats infected with JHMV brings into question the relevance of autoimmunity to the chronic CNS disease of rats because in the WF strain inflammatory responses are either minimal or absent (unpublished observations from this study) . It should also be noted from this study that WF rats are not inducible for EAE by immunization with neural antigen(s), providing additional evidence against the likelihood that demyelination associated with JHMV is the consequence of an autoimmune disease process .From the current findings we continue to favour the hypothesis that in JHMV infected rats, the paralytic form of the disease which develops and is associated with demyelination, is the consequence of an infection of the oligodendrocyte targets . The simultaneous tropism of this virus for neurons can result in an acute encephalomyelitis, evident when very young rats are challenged, 1-3 or in a grey matter disease of the type described here, when older athymic' or CsA treated rats are infected .Materials and methodsAnimals . Inbred Wistar Lewis (WL) and Wistar Furth (WF) rats were obtained as breeding stock from Harlan Sprague Dawley and bred in house as reported previously .'",
