We report about a case of unusual bilateral radial nerve palsy in a term-born girl who recovered completely after 10 months and review the English-speaking literature about this condition. Review of the literature shows less than 60 reported cases of radial nerve palsy, most of them unilateral. Conclusion: Besides the clinical examination, in most cases, no further diagnostic investigation is necessary. An incomplete restitution is rare as recovery mostly occurs within 3-6 months.",

Prolonged labour (>18 h) was present in about 85 % [1-4, 7, 11-13] . This leads most authors to the conclusion that intrauterine constriction/amnion bands or pressure on the arm either in utero or during delivery causes local fat necrosis, irritating the radial nerve when leaving the radial groove which therefore could be responsible for the radial nerve palsy. However, our reported child did not have any history of prolonged or complicated delivery and no skin marks were [1, 3, 7, 9] and 15 % without complications at birth [1, 6, 9, 14, 15] although suffering from isolated radial nerve palsy. Most authors assume that pressure due to abnormal intrauterine position accounts for radial nerve palsy, too. In general, the outcome of this lesion is good: complete recovery was seen in 52 (94 %) children during 4 days to 2 years, treated with wrist splinting and physiotherapy [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . In two children, there was improvement at the last follow-up (3 weeks, 1 month) [2, 9] , and only one child underwent surgery [14] . All children with a bilateral manifestation completely recovered.",

In an ultrasound, one author detected a thickening of the radial nerve [13] . In other cases, histology fat necrosis [7, 10] and a granulomatous reaction [10] were reported in histological examinations and an EMG showed either normal results [11] , absent sensory and motor response [7, 8] or fibrillation [15] . In most cases, no further investigation has been done. In a recently published case [5] , a subcutaneous fat necrosis and a deep-seated hematoma in the region of the radial nerve are documented. In our case, we decided to renounce further investigation due to the typical clinical features.",
