The activities of these cytokines have been studied extensively in vitro and in rodents, but in vivo studies on the role of these cytokines in infectious diseases of food animals are few. This review concentrates on in vivo studies of cytokine involvement in infectious respiratory diseases of swine, with an emphasis on viral infections. First evidence for the role of early cytokines in pneumonia in swine came from experimental infections with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. The role of TNF-a and IL-1 in the symptoms and pathology of porcine pleuropneumonia has recently been proven by use of an adenovirus vector expressing the anti-in\u00afammatory IL-10. In the authors' laboratory, studies were undertaken to investigate the relationship between viral respiratory disease and bioactive lung lavage levels of IFN-a, TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6. Out of three respiratory viruses\u00d0porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine in\u00afuenza virus (SIV)\u00d0only SIV induced acute respiratory disease and severe lung damage by itself. Disease and lung pathology were tightly associated with the simultaneous production of IFN-a, TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6. In challenge studies of SIV-vaccinated pigs, levels of IFN-a, TNF-a and IL-6, but not IL-1 were correlated with clinical and virological protection. Multifactorial respiratory disease was reproduced by combined inoculations with PRCV or PRRSV followed by LPS from Escherichia coli. In comparison with the respective single inoculations, which were subclinical, there was a true potentiation of disease and production of TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6. TNF-a and IL-6 were best correlated with disease. In further studies, we will use more speci\u00aec strategies to dissect the role of cytokines during viral infections. #",

Each of these cytokines has a number of local and systemic effects, among others: upregulation of adhesion molecules on the vascular endothelium and leukocytes, activation of neutrophil and macrophage antimicrobial activities, fever, induction of acute phase proteins, catabolic effects on muscle and fat cells (for reviews see Murtaugh et al., 1996; Bogdan, 2000; Dinarello, 2000) . TNF-a and IL-1, the classical``proin\u00afammatory'' cytokines, stimulate nearly all local and systemic in\u00afammatory responses. IL-6, which can be induced by TNF-a and IL-1, is pyrogenic, induces Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 87 (2002) 161\u00b1168 the release of acute phase reactants by the liver, and in turn switches off proin\u00afammatory cytokine production. While TNF-a and IL-1 mediate the initial adhesive reaction of neutrophils to the endothelium, IL-8 appears to be essential for the directed migration of leukocytes into the infected tissue (Strieter and Kunkel, 1994) . IFN-a, though best known for its antiviral effects, can exert all of the systemic effects mentioned here and induces adhesion molecules in some in vitro systems. Due to their diverse actions, cytokines such as IFN-a and IL-6 have been classi\u00aeed as``proin\u00afammatory''bysome researchers andas``anti-in\u00afammatory'' by others. The term``early cytokines'' applies to all cytokines mentioned here and will be used further.",

            "text": "The amount of in vitro studies on cytokine actions and interactions is impressive, but there are rather few in vivo studies on cytokines in infectious disease models of food animals. Still, the response of cells to cytokines can be markedly affected by the``context'', and the expression in vivo veritas is more valid for cytokine studies than for any other type of research. Here we focus on in vivo research of cytokine involvement in infectious respiratory diseases of swine. This type of research encounters some particular problems. First, cytokine production during pulmonary infections is mainly restricted to the lung and diffusion of cytokines across the blood\u00b1alveolar barrier is rather limited (Nelson et al., 1989) . Samples of the lower respiratory tract, such as lung tissue, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells or\u00afuid, are thus needed to study cytokine production, and these are dif\u00aecult to obtain from living animals. For cytokine studies in particular, it is problematic to perform serial in vivo lung lavages because the procedure in itself causes lung damage with neutrophil in\u00aeltration which can in\u00afuence cytokine production. Also, the amount of cells and\u00afuid recovered in this way is rather small and not representative of the whole lung. Second, the possibilities for intervention in the form of treatment with speci\u00aec cytokine-blocking antibodies or antagonists are limited. The major problem here is the delivery of such molecules to the deeper lung over a prolonged time period. This is the reason why most studies have only demonstrated associations between lung cytokines and other parameters, without proving a true cause\u00b1effect relationship. Third, respiratory infections occur with a high prevalence in swine, and the upper respiratory tract harbors commensal bacteria that can easily colonize the lungs in the presence of predisposing events. Also, some of the early cytokines are induced readily by a variety of stimuli. Thus, pigs of a high-health status are required for the study of cytokines at the lung level.",

Dyspnoea, increased respiratory rate, fever, depression and inappetence occur as early as 2 h after endotracheal inoculation of A. pleuropneumoniae (Baarsch et al., 2000) . TNF-a, IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA levels in the lung increased at the same time and cytokine expression was localized to the periphery of lung lesions (Baarsch et al., 1995; Choi et al., 1999; Huang et al., 1999) . The studies by Baarsch et al. (1995 Baarsch et al. ( , 2000 illustrate perfectly that the results of cytokine measurements are dramatically affected by the sampling compartment and the detection method used, as well as by the time of sampling. IL-6 mRNA, for example, was detected by Northern blotting in lung parenchyma but not in BAL cells, whereas in situ hybridization (ISH) on BAL cells was clearly positive. Similarly, TNF-a mRNA in BAL cells appeared to be increased in ISH, but TNF-a bioactivity in BAL uids was undetectable in a standard L929 cytotoxicity assay. In later experiments by the same group, however, elevated TNF-a levels were found in BAL uids by ELISA (Morrison et al., 2000) . In summary, TNF-a as well as bioactive IL-1 and IL-6 have been detected in lung lavage\u00afuids and the role of the \u00aerst two cytokines has recently been proven by administration to the lung of a recombinant replication-de\u00aecient adenovirus which expressed the anti-in\u00afammatory cytokine IL-10. IL-10 expression reduced IL-1 and TNF-a secretion, and this was associated with clinical protection and a signi\u00aecant reduction of lung pathology (Morrison et al., 2000) .",

We chose to detect bioactive cytokines in these studies because bioassays have the greatest biological significance. The major \u00aending was that cytokines may provide a clue for the remarkable differences in pathogenicity between the three pulmonary viruses. After intratracheal inoculation of gnotobiotic pigs with high virus doses, both PRCV and PRRSV were unable to induce overt respiratory signs. The infection with PRCV, which replicates in alveolar epithelial cells, was asymptomatic, though gross lung consolidation consistently occurred. Microscopic lung in\u00afammation and airway epithelial necrosis, on the other hand, remained very mild. Of the four cytokines (IFN-a, TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6) examined, only IFN-a was found at high and sustained levels. PRRSV, a macrophage-tropic virus, caused a transient fever, anorexia and lethargy without respiratory disease. There was massive in\u00aeltration of alveolar septa and spaces with macrophage-like cells. Lung epithelial damage, neutrophil in\u00aeltration and gross lung consolidation, on the contrary, were minimal. Only IL-1 was consistently recovered from BAL\u00afuids of PRRSV-infected pigs.",

The hallmarks of the infection are a fulminant virus replication in bronchial, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelia, degeneration and desquamation of epithelial cells, neutrophil in\u00aeltration, and the appearance of well-demarkated, dark red areas of gross pneumonia. Neutrophils are the predominant cell type in BAL\u00afuids and they are thought to be responsible for the typical breathing dif\u00aeculties and lung damage. Fig. 1 illustrates the time course of pathogenetic events and the corresponding cytokine pro\u00aele after intratracheal inoculation of gnotobiotic pigs with SIV. Disease, peak virus titres and neutrophil in\u00aeltration developed as early as 18\u00b124 h after inoculation. Clinical signs and neutrophil in\u00aeltration resolved very rapidly and virus titres had decreased signi\u00aecantly by 72 h. Excessive amounts of bioactive IFN-a, TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6 were found in BAL uids of these pigs. There was a tight correlation between cytokines on the one hand and disease, neutrophil in\u00aeltration and peak virus titres on the other. As clinical signs and lung in\u00afammation subsided, IFN-a and IL-6 titres decreased and TNF-a and IL-1 became undetectable. Because of the synergistic interactions between these cytokines, the cytokin\u00e8`q uartet'' is likely to have much more potent effects than each cytokine on its own. Furthermore, cytokines other than those examined here may also contribute to the pathogenesis. One candidate cytokine is IL-8, the primary neutrophil chemoattractant. IL-8 is one of the more dif\u00aecult cytokines to detect by bioassay and commercial ELISAs for porcine IL-8 have only recently become available. Consequently, the secretion of IL-8 in body\u00afuids of pigs has never been demonstrated so far and its signi\u00aecance in diseases of swine remains to be proven.",

All three cytokines were directly correlated with the viral load and with disease severity. This type of study however does not really prove the role of cytokines in disease. Because replication of the challenge virus was signi\u00aecantly reduced in the vaccinated pigs, direct pathogenic effects of the virus could probably not occur.

All pigs were euthanatized between 3 and 72 h after LPS, or at corresponding times after the single PRCV inoculation. The effects of separate virus or LPS inoculations were subclinical and failed to induce high and sustained cytokine levels. The combination of both agents, on the contrary, resulted in marked labored breathing, dullness and loss of appetite during the \u00aerst 10\u00b112 h after LPS. Prior infection with PRCV truly potentiated the cytokine response to LPS, with 10\u00b1100 times higher titres of TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6 than after the respective single inoculations. Despite very high IFN-a titres in the dually inoculated pigs, similar titres may also occur after a single PRCV infection (Van Reeth et al., 1999) . Experiments with different time intervals between PRCV and LPS inoculations have demonstrated a distinct time frame post-viral infection during which the synergy between virus and LPS is maximal. That is, typical respiratory disease was seen with 8\u00b132 h intervals between virus and LPS, but not with shorter or longer intervals. Titres of TNF-a and IL-6 were also critically dependent on the time interval, and those cytokines were best correlated with disease. IL-1 and IFN-a, on the other hand, were not affected by the time interval and appear to play a minor if any role. The time interval experiments suggest that one virus replication cycle in the lungs must be completed at the time of LPS inoculation for enhanced disease and TNF-a/IL-6 production to occur.",

Still, PRRSV and PRCV differ completely from a pathogenetic point of view. Unlike PRCV, PRRSV has a speci\u00aec tropism for lung macrophages and the infection produces a massive and long-lasting in\u00aeltration of the lungs with macrophagelike cells. Macrophages are pre-eminent producer cells of TNF-a and IL-1 upon in vitro LPS exposure. Because absolute numbers of macrophage-like cells increase approximately 5-fold after PRRSV infection, one would assume that the lungs contain more potentially LPS-responsive cells than after any other virus infection. Still, TNF-a, IL-1, as well as IL-6 pro\u00aeles were remarkably similar to those seen in PRCV\u00b1LPS experiments. This raises questions about the importance of macrophages relative to other lung cells in virus\u00b1LPS induced cytokine responses. The in vivo situation is probably much more complicated than any in vitro system, and several types of lung cells may be involved. In contrast with the cytokines just mentioned, IFN-a levels were some 1000 times lower than in the PRCV\u00b1LPS model. PRRSV is a very poor inducer of IFN-a in itself (Albina et al., 1998; Van Reeth et al., 1999) , and the subsequent LPS inoculation apparently did not affect IFN-a titres.

Consequently, we will use the PRRSV\u00b1LPS model to test preventive or therapeutic measures and study the role of cytokines in more detail. In ongoing experiments, we are studying the effect of treatment with pentoxifylline (PTX) on the clinical response to PRRSV\u00b1LPS. PTX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, has been documen-ted to block the production of TNF-a, and may also reduce production of IL-1 and IL-6 (Neuner et al., 1994) .

One important issue is that the same cytokines mediating disease may also regulate disease resistance. In fact, IFN-a has extremely potent antiviral effects, and in vitro antiviral effects have also been attributed to TNF-a and IL-1. Fever and neutrophils are part of the innate immune response to pathogens, and their suppression has proven deleterious in many instances. With the exception of IL-8, the early cytokines are also involved in speci\u00aec immunity by activation of T cells, B cells and macrophages. In the case of SIV, virus clearance from the lungs and the development of a speci\u00aec immune response occur within days. It is conceivable therefore that cytokines mediate both clinicopathological manifestations and the resolution of a SIV infection.
