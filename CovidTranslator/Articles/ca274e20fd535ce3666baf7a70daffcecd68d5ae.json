Magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral swelling of the hippocampus with T2 hyperintensity and contrast enhancing image, suggesting hippocampal necrosis. The cat completely recovered after treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AED) and administration of prednisolone (1 mg/kg PO q24h for 4 days and tapered). However, cluster seizures reoccurred and developed into status epilepticus despite increasing doses of AED. Although the convulsions were resolved by other AEDs, stupor and renal failure developed, and the cat was euthanized. Pathological findings were consistent with hippocampal necrosis. Immunological analysis for leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) autoantibodies was negative, but antibodies against DCC (deleted in colorectal carcinoma) known as netrin-1 receptor were found. This report describes a case of feline autoimmune limbic encephalitis and hippocampal necrosis that were presumably associated with DCC autoantibodies.",

These clinical findings suggested the cat was in postictal state, in nonconvulsive status epilepticus, or extreme sensitivity to the adverse effects of PB. Phenobarbital was discontinued, and zonisamide (ZNS; 4.6 mg/kg PO q12h), meloxicam (0.3 mg/kg SC q24h), ampicillin (25 mg/kg IV q12h), and IV fluid therapy with glycyrrhizin and glutathione were administered. Two days later (day 7), seizures were under control, and the above-mentioned neurological findings and temperature had recovered. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (0.4 Tesla Aperto; Hitachi, Japan) of the head was performed on day 8, which revealed bilateral hippocampal swelling with T2-weighted/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity and T1-weighted hypointensity that showed strong contrast enhancement after IV administration of gadodiamide (0.2 mL/kg; Omniscan, Daiichi-Sankyo, Japan) on transverse ( Figure 1 ) and dorsal planes.",

In 1 study of cats, 1 of 5 cats with anti-VGKC LE had papillary adenomas in the lung. 14 In the present case, although no tumor could be confirmed by thoracic and abdominal radiographs, these findings could not necessarily exclude a neoplastic disease. Whole-body necropsy would have been necessary to address this. Therefore, we are not able to define whether there was an association with a neoplasm or not.",

To our knowledge, diseases associated with DCC or its antibodies have not been reported in cats (nor in dogs) to date. Although DCC was first suggested as a candidate tumor suppressor gene for colorectal cancer, subsequent studies proved DCC is 1 of the receptors of netrin-1 that is an axon guidance molecule (secretory protein). 15, 16 Netrin-1 and DCC mediate axon guidance or neuronal migrations. Netrin-1 and DCC knockout mice have commissural dysplasia in the central nervous system. 10, 15 Also, DCC has been identified as a causative gene of congenital mirror movement in human. 17 DCC regulates synaptic function including NMDA receptordependent synaptic plasticity in maturated brains. 18, 19 Anti-DCC autoantibodies are associated more with thymoma and myasthenia gravis and less with LE. 8, 20 In 1 human study, however, 4 of 12 patients with DCC antibodies were diagnosed as LE although F I G U R E 4 The case cat serum antibodies do not bind to leucinerich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1). COS7 cells were transfected with cell-surface expressed LGI1 tagged with the FLAG epitope and GPI anchor signal. Transfected cells were fixed and doubly stained with serum immunoglobulin G (IgGs) (right column, red) together with the antibodies to the FLAG tag (left column, green). Human LE patient serum was used as a positive control (tops). Nuclear DNA was stained by Hoechst 33342 (blue) to distinguish untransfected cells. Scale bar, 20 \u03bcm. See also the Supporting Information the association was not statistically significant. 8 These LE patients with DCC antibodies had also LGI1 antibodies that were significantly associated with LE. Thus, LE of these patients might have originated from LGI1 antibodies rather than DCC antibodies. However, we excluded the association of LGI antibodies in the present cat; therefore, this might be the first LE case associated only with DCC antibodies through human and feline autoimmune LE. Recent studies suggested DCC and netrin-1 contribution to synaptic excitation. 18, 19 Therefore, the possibility of direct contribution of DCC antibodies to the pathogenesis of LE should be considered in the future.",

Generally, in human medicine, paraneoplastic LEs have poor response to immunosuppressive treatment, whereas non-paraneoplastic LEs show comparatively good response. 11 In addition, it is also described that human patients with paraneoplastic epilepsy are poorly responsive to antiepileptic drugs and require earlier treatment for underlying tumors. 13 We could not define whether the present cat was paraneoplastic or non-paraneoplastic, whether it was associated with DCC antibodies only or whether there was coexistence of multiple antibodies, and whether F I G U R E 5 Immunoprecipitation of the cell surface target protein with cat serum antibodies.

From the owner's description, the seizures were consistent with focal limbic seizures (bilateral mydriasis, chewing, salivation, and gazing), that is, focal seizures with impaired responsiveness (former; complex partial seizures) with orofacial involvement, with and without evolving into generalized seizures. Phenobarbital (2.7 mg/kg PO q12h) was prescribed for 4 days by another veterinarian. At the time of presentation (day 5), although the convulsive seizures were controlled, neurological examination showed obtundation, tetraparesis, loss of postural reactions in all limbs, bilateral loss of menace response, and bilateral mydriasis with normal pupil light reflex. Nociception and spinal reflexes were normal. These neurological findings suggested diffuse bilateral forebrain disease.

However, clustering focal limbic seizures with or without evolution into generalized seizures recurred on day 39 and the clinical condition of the cat gradually deteriorated. In spite of increased dosing of ZNS (7.5 mg/kg; 20.9 \u03bcg/mL), the cat developed status epilepticus on day 94. Traditional treatment for status epilepticus, including IV administrations of diazepam, PB, and levetiracetam, and continuous rate infusion administrations of diazepam, inhibited convulsive seizures, but consciousness was not recovered. Finally, owing to stupor and severe azotemia with myoglobinuria, the cat was euthanized (day 96). After euthanasia, the brain was removed and histopathologically examined. However, a full necropsy was not allowed by the owner. Histopathological methods are summarized in the Supporting Information. Microscopically bilateral hippocampal atrophy and loss of pyramidal cells were observed (Figure 2A). Perivascular infiltration of mononuclear cells was observed (Figure 2B). In such areas, scattered glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive gemistocytic astrocytes were observed (Figure 2c). Some pyramidal cells were positive for feline IgG (Figure 2d). Immunohistochemistry for CD3 and CD20 revealed that the mononuclear cells were predominantly CD20-positive B cells (data not shown). Iba1-positive phagocytic cells were found in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (data not shown). Changes such as neuronal loss, astrocytosis, or immunoglobulin G deposition were limited in the cerebral cortex and absent in the cerebellum.

This indicates that the feline serum contained other antibodies than LGI1 antibodies. To identify the target antigen, we conducted immunoprecipitation with the feline serum antibodies from rat-cultured hippocampal neurons. A protein with a molecular mass of 190 kDa (p190) was specifically detected only in the immunoprecipitate of the case cat, but not in those of the control cats (Figure 5). Note that there was no specific antigen for serum of the 1 healthy cat (#1) which bound to rat cultured neurons (Figure 5, the lane of Healthy cat #1). Liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry analysis of this protein band showed that molecular weights of 3 peptide fragments derived fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).

Although 1 healthy cat serum (#1) bound to rat cultured neurons, we confirmed that the serum has no apparent target antigen by immunoprecipitation (see Figure 5, lane of healthy cat #1).

The score of SEQUEST search algorithm from Bio-Works software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was 28.13, indicating a high confidence score (>20). Although 190 kDa was larger than the estimated molecular weight of rat DCC (157.74 kDa), a previous study indicated that the molecular weight of endogenous DCC on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was about 190 kDa. 10 This difference is explained by the post-translational modification of DCC protein in neurons.
