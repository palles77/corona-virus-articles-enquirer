It causes a highly contagious disease which affects the respiratory, reproductive, neurological and renal systems of chickens, resulting great economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide. The coronavirus (CoV) main protease (M pro ), which plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication through a highly complex cascade involving the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins, is an attractive target for antiviral drug design. In this study, IBV M pro was overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Crystals suitable for X-ray crystallography have been obtained using microseeding techniques and belong to space group P6 1 22. X-ray diffraction data were collected in-house to 2.7 \u00c5 resolution from a single crystal. The unit-cell parameters were a = b = 119.1, c = 270.7 \u00c5 , = = 90, = 120 . Three molecules were predicted to be present in the asymmetric unit from a calculated self-rotation function.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the prototype of the genus Coronavirus (Spaan & Cavanagh, 2004; Lai & Holmes, 2001) , the members of which can infect humans and multiple species of animals, causing a variety of highly prevalent and severe diseases (Spaan & Cavanagh, 2004; Ziebuhr, 2005; Pereira, 1989; Lai & Holmes, 2001) . For instance, a previously unknown human coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the emergence of which was most likely to have been the result of animalhuman transmission (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005) , was identified as the aetiological agent of a global outbreak of a life-threatening form of pneumonia called severe acute respiratory syndrome (Peiris et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Drosten et al., 2003) . From their genome sequences, coronaviruses can be classified into three distinct groups (Spaan & Cavanagh, 2004) . IBV belongs to group III (Lai & Holmes, 2001) , which only infects avian species, and leads to a highly contagious disease affecting the respiratory, reproductive, neurological and renal systems of chickens, resulting in a drop in egg production in adult birds and damaging the developing reproductive system in young birds. IBV infection predisposes chickens to infection with secondary pathogens. The incidence of IBV-related nephritis can result in high mortality rates (Siddell et al., 2005; Cavanagh, 2005; Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000) . IBV infection is prevalent in all countries with an intensive poultry industry, with the incidence of infection approaching 100% in most locations, causing great economic loss worldwide (Ignjatovic & Sapats, 2000) . At the present time, control of IBV relies almost exclusively on vaccination and management (Holmes, 2001; Siddell et al., 2005) . However, there are two major problems associated with the use of vaccines. Firstly, there are many serotypes of IBV; secondly, there is at least circumstantial evidence to suggest that new serotypes may emerge by recombination, possibly involving the live vaccine virus itself (Lee & Jackwood, 2000; Cavanagh, 2003) .",

However, there are no structures available for group III coronaviruses, which are distinct from those belonging to groups I and II.

The positive clones harbouring the recombinant plasmid were grown to an OD 600 of 0.6 at 310 K with shaking in 1 l LB medium containing 0.1 mg ml \u00c01 ampicillin. The GST-fusion protein, GST-IBV M pro , was then expressed by introducing 0.5 mM IPTG and incubating at 289 K for 10 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl) and sonicated at 277 K. The cell lysate was centrifuged, the supernatant was collected and the fusion protein was purified by GST-glutathione affinity chromatography. The GST tag of the fusion protein was cleaved with GST-rhinovirus 3C protease. The recombinant IBV M pro was further purified using anion-exchange chromatography. The purified and concentrated IBV M pro (25 mg ml \u00c01 ) was stored in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM DTT for crystallization.",

The crystal was mounted on a nylon loop and flash-cooled in a cold nitrogen-gas stream at 100 K using an Oxford Cryosystems cryostream. The cryoprotectant solution contained 20% glycerol, 2% PEG 4000, 9.6% 2-propanol, 0.08 M sodium cacodylate pH 6.5. A total of 120 frames of data were collected with an oscillation angle of 0.6 and an exposure time of 180 s for each image (Fig. 2) . All intensity data were indexed, integrated and scaled with the HKL-2000 programs DENZO and SCALEPACK (Otwinowski & Minor, 1997) .",
