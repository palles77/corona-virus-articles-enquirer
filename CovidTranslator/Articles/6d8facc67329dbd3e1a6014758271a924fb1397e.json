            "text": "Major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I, or HLA-I in humans) molecules are cell-surface glycoproteins. Their function is to select peptides derived from the intracellular protein metabolism and present them to cytotoxic T cells of the adaptive immune system, thereby allowing the protein content of cells to be surveyed and controlled (reviewed in Guermonprez et al., 2002) . The specificity of MHC-I molecules determines which peptides will be presented and potentially recognized by the immune system. The HLA system is highly polymorphic in a manner that effectively diversifies immune responsiveness. Almost 1600 different HLA-I alleles have been identified in human populations, making MHC-I the most polymorphic gene system known. In an attempt to reduce this complexity, it has been suggested that the majority of HLA-I molecules can be clustered into one of 12 currently defined HLA supertypes. More than 120 different HLA-I crystal structures have been reported and the majority of these belong to the HLA-A2 supertype; other supertypes are sparsely populated or not at all. Only a few structures of HLA-I alleles belonging to the HLA-B62 supertype have been reported, including two structures of HLA-B*1501 (R\u00f8der et al., 2006) . HLA-B*1501 is the prototypical member of the HLA-B62 supertype. HLA-B*1501 is frequent in Southeast Asian and in European populations, where it often accounts for more than 10% of the HLA-I phenotype.",

To this end, we are generating structural (Blicher et al., 2005 R\u00f8der et al., 2006) and biochemical (Buus et al., 1995; Sylvester-Hvid et al., 2002; Lauem\u00f8ller et al., 2000) information on peptide-HLA interactions and using this information to generate fast computational predictions of peptide binding (Stryhn et al., 1996; Buus et al., 2003; Peters et al., 2006) . A detailed understanding of peptide-MHC interactions will support a general understanding of the nature of T-cell recognition and a rational exploitation of human immune responses (Lauem\u00f8ller et al., 2000) . Thus, predictive algorithms allow entire genomes to be rapidly and accurately screened for potential immunogenic epitopes (Wang et al., 2007) . One approach, which might be independent of large-scale biochemical experimentation, would be to use structural information to predict peptide binders (Rognan et al., 1999) . To populate the 'structure space' of HLA molecules, we have previously reported two HLA-A*1101 (Blicher et al., 2005 and two HLA-B*1501 structures (R\u00f8der et al., 2006) . Here, we report a crystal structure of HLA-B*1501 in complex with a SARS coronavirus-derived nonapeptide (VQQESSFVM).",

Structural superpositioning of this and a previously published HLA-B*1501 structure (PDB code 1xr9) using the first 181 CA atoms in the -chain yields a root-mean-square deviation of 0.34 \u00c5 . The structure consists of all of the residues of the heavy (a) and light (b) chains and the bound peptide (p) (see Table 1 for details). The model was refined to an R value of 18.8% and an R free value of 22.7%. Generally, the electron density is clearly defined and all the residues lining the peptide-binding groove and the peptide residues are completely resolved (see Fig. 2 ). Furthermore, the disulfide bond in the 2 domain of the peptide-binding groove is clearly defined, as depicted in the inset in Fig. 1 . It has been speculated that the oxidation state of this disulfide bond is important for the loading of the peptide-binding groove with a peptide (Park et al., 2006) . When this disulfide bond is oxidized and a peptide is bound, the 1 and 2 domains are thought to be more stable. Some solvent-exposed residues (including pSer5 of the peptide) are found in multiple conformations. A Ramachandran analysis estimated that 91.4% of the residues are found in the favoured regions and no residues are found in disallowed regions.",
