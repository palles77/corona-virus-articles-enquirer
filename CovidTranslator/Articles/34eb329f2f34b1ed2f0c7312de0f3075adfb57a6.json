            "text": "Disinfection guidelines exist for pathogen inactivation in potable water and recycled water, but wastewater with high numbers of particles can be more difficult to disinfect, making compliance with the guidelines problematic. Disinfection guidelines specify that drinking water with turbidity 1 Nephelometric Turbidity Units (NTU) is not suitable for disinfection and therefore not fit for purpose. Treated wastewater typically has higher concentrations of particles (1e10 NTU for secondary treated effluent). Two processes widely used for disinfecting wastewater are chlorination and ultraviolet radiation. In both cases, particles in wastewater can interfere with disinfection and can significantly increase treatment costs by increasing operational expenditure (chemical demand, power consumption) or infrastructure costs by requiring additional treatment processes to achieve the required levels of pathogen inactivation. Many microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, protozoans) associate with particles, which can allow them to survive disinfection processes and cause a health hazard. Improved understanding of this association will enable development of cost-effective treatment, which will become increasingly important as indirect and direct potable reuse of wastewater becomes more widespread in both developed and developing countries. This review provides an overview of wastewater and associated treatment processes, the pathogens in wastewater, the nature of particles in wastewater and how they interact with pathogens, and how particles can impact disinfection processes.",

Increasing population growth and demand, combined with reductions in available freshwater due to climate change and drought (specifically the Millennium drought from 1995 to 2009), have driven developments in wastewater recycling and water management within Australia (Chiew, Young, Cai, & Teng, 2011; Greenway, 2005; Lazarova et al., 2001; Moe & Rheingans, 2006; Pigram, 2007) . Similar challenges have affected other countries, including the United States, Western Europe, and Israel, leading to an increased focus on wastewater reuse internationally (Wade Miller, 2006) . The State of California has been impacted particularly by water shortages, and an extreme 5-year drought prompted local water resource authorities to make regulatory provisions for direct and indirect potable reuse of wastewater (ORDER-WQ-2016 -0068-DDW, 2016 . In Australia the percentage of wastewater reuse varies in different states, but overall has increased from 2001 to 2015 (Table 1 ). The nonpotable reuse of treated wastewater includes irrigation of crops and parklands, dual reticulation within domestic and commercial buildings (Moe & Rheingans, 2006) , and recreation and mining (Dillon, 2000) . Wastewater can also be treated to high standards for direct or indirect potable reuse applications, such as the supplementation of surface or groundwaters for drinking (Moe & Rheingans, 2006) .",

In Australia regulatory authorities have deemed that the tolerable risk from any given pathogen in reuse water is no more than 1 micro-DALY per person per year. The removal or inactivation of pathogens by various treatment and disinfection processes can be impaired by particles in the wastewater, leading to noncompliance with health standards and increased risk to end users. It is therefore critical to understand the interactions between particles, pathogens, and wastewater treatment processes to enable optimal removal of pathogens and the production of safe reuse water. This paper provides an overview of wastewater, the pathogens and indicator organisms of interest in wastewater, the treatment processes commonly used for the production of reuse water, the interactions between wastewater particles and pathogens, and how these can affect treatment processes and impact upon wastewater reuse.",

While many of these bacteria are commensal and beneficial to their hosts, some are pathogenic and these enteric bacterial pathogens constitute the majority of bacterial pathogens in wastewater (Varela & Manaia, 2013) . Major human bacterial pathogens in wastewater include Salmonella spp., Escherichia spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Klebsiella spp., Leptospira spp., Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas hydrophila, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium spp., and Pseudomonas (Cai & Zhang, 2013; Kristian Stevik, Aa, Ausland, & Fredrik Hanssen, 2004; Maynard et al., 2005) . Enteric bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella spp., Escherichia spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., and V. cholerae typically cause gastrointestinal infections such as diarrhea, dysentery, and gastroenteritis (Anastasi et al., 2010; Okoh, Odjadjare, Igbinosa, & Osode, 2007; Varela & Manaia, 2013) . Helicobacter pylori, which causes gastric ulcers and is linked to some cancers, might also be waterborne but transmission pathways for this pathogen have not been conclusively demonstrated Table 2 The major pathogens of concern in municipal wastewater and diseases or illness associated with them Name of pathogen (Anastasi et al., 2010) . Other diseases caused by bacteria in wastewater include wound infections (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), respiratory infections (L. pneumophila, Mycobacterium avium) and leptospirosis (Leptospira) (Gerardi & Zimmerman, 2004; Levy, Fine, & Bar-Tal, 2010) . Some bacteria, such as L. pneumophila, M. avium, P. aeruginosa, and A. hydrophila, are environmental and are opportunistic rather than frank pathogens, since they cause disease in a host with a predisposing factor, such as reduced immunity or with reduced physical barriers to infection due to burns or wounds (Gerardi & Zimmerman, 2004) . Escherichia coli are genetically diverse and predominantly harmless bacteria that are part of the normal gut flora of warm-blooded animals, including humans. This species has been widely used as an indicator of fecal contamination and is found in densities of 10 5 e10 10 colony-forming units per liter of raw sewage (Matthews, Stratton, Schreoder, & Toze, 2010) . Some strains of E. coli possess additional genes, encoding virulence determinants such as adhesion factors and toxins, which allow them to be pathogenic and cause intestinal or extraintestinal diseases. These pathogenic strains can cause gastroenteritis, diarrhea, urinary tract infections hemolytic uremic syndrome, and meningitis (Anastasi et al., 2010) .",

Untreated wastewater can have as many as 10 3 e10 7 virus particles per liter of wastewater (Keegan et al., 2010; Okoh et al., 2007) . However, the density of viruses in treated wastewater depends on various factors such as type of treatment process, season, and geographical area (Kitajima, Iker, Pepper, & Gerba, 2014) . Many of the viruses are poorly removed by the secondary treatment processes used to remove bacterial pathogens (Ottoson, Hansen, Bj\u20ac orlenius, Norder, & Stenstr\u20ac om, 2006) . The major viral pathogens in wastewater are enteric viruses such as hepatitis A, norovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, astroviruses, and the various enteroviruses (Ashbolt, 2004; Cai & Zhang, 2013) . The site of virus multiplication in the host is generally related to the type of disease caused, with most enteric viruses multiplying in the host's intestine, although in some cases other tissues can be infected (Wyn-Jones et al., 2011) . Consequently, enteric viruses can cause a variety of diseases in humans, such as gastroenteritis, meningitis, hepatitis, and myocarditis (Ashbolt, 2004) . These enteric viruses are shed in high quantities, 10 5 e10 11 virus particles/gram of feces, by infected individuals (Fong & Lipp, 2005; Okoh, Sibanda, & Gusha, 2010) . Several emerging viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human parechovirus, can also be excreted in feces and found in wastewater (Wyn-Jones et al., 2011) . Industrial waste from slaughterhouses can add zoonotic viruses to wastewater, such as animal adenoviruses, sopaviruses, and hepatitis E (Wyn-Jones et al., 2011) . A variety of pathogenic plant viruses, such as pepper mild mottle virus and tobacco mosaic virus, have been identified in human feces and wastewater .",

Protozoan parasites, such as Cryptosporidium parvum, Cryptosporidium hominis, and Giardia duodenalis are commonly detected in sewage (Li, Craik, Smith, & Belosevic, 2009 ), although their abundance may be seasonal, depending on country and climate. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are intestinal parasites that infect humans and animals. In the case of Cryptosporidium, there is no effective drug treatment that directly kills this parasite in the host and so infection can be fatal in patients lacking a functional immune system (Abrahamsen et al., 2004) . The transmissive stage of Cryptosporidium is a nonreproductive and dormant oocyst (Searcy, Packman, Atwill, & Harter, 2005) , which is shed in feces and is highly infective. Cryptosporidium infects host enterocytes, causing diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, a condition commonly referred to as cryptosporidiosis (Fletcher, Stark, Harkness, & Ellis, 2012) . G. duodenalis is a unicellular flagellate eukaryote that is another major waterborne pathogen causing intestinal infection (Adam, 2001) . The transmissive stage of G. duodenalis is a dormant cyst (Adam, 2001 ) and infection, known as giardiasis, can cause acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, malabsorption, and weight loss (Fletcher et al., 2012) . Other pathogenic protozoa, including Cyclospora, Entamoeba histolytica (which causes amoebic dysentery), Isospora belli, and Enterocytozoon bieneusi, have also been reported in outbreaks of waterborne illness (Khanum et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Wastewater is a reservoir for pathogens and poses a major health risk, particularly when discharges enter recreational waters on in the case of reuse. Culture-based methods are traditionally used for detecting microorganisms, but their usefulness is limited due to the occurrence and prevalence of pathogens and because many are not easy to culture, cannot be cultured, or are otherwise expensive to isolate and enumerate (Gilbride, Lee, & Beaudette, 2006; Keegan et al., 2010) . Since it is not practical (or in some cases possible) to detect and monitor all known pathogens, indicator organisms are employed as surrogates for the presence of fecal contamination and hence possible presence of pathogens (Harwood et al., 2005) . A good indicator should be present in the pathogen source and absent from unpolluted areas. It should be present in abundance, nonpathogenic, easy to culture, and show similar behavior as the pathogen (Bosch, 2010) . The most widely used indicator organisms are enteric bacteria, primarily due to the ease and low cost of the relevant culture detection methods. E. coli, in particular, is considered a mandatory fecal indicator by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and European Union for risk characterization of drinking water sources, compliance monitoring of drinking water, and monitoring of recycled water and wastewater discharges (Stevens, Ashbolt, & Cunliffe, 2003) . Other bacteria, such as enterococci, have also been used as fecal indicators (Stevens et al., 2003) . However, given differences in size and structure, it is unlikely that all groups of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and helminths) will behave in the same way, therefore it is not ideal to have a single, universal microbial indicator (Ashbolt, Grabow, & Snozzi, 2001) . Bacterial fecal indicators have been shown to be poor surrogates for viruses and protozoans, highlighting the need for different indicators for different groups of pathogens (Duran et al., 2003) . Bacteriophage, such as somatic coliphage, F-specific RNA coliphage, and Bacteroides fragilis bacteriophage have been suggested as potential viral fecal indicators, as well as indicators for monitoring the effectiveness of treatment processes (Duran et al., 2003; Monis et al., 2015) . Fecal indicator organisms are only linked to the presence or absence of fecal contamination (and hence risk of pathogen presence), but they do not necessarily give any information about the movement, removal, or inactivation of pathogens. Therefore, there is a need for process indicators or model organisms, which are defined as groups of organisms that are indicative of pathogen behavior in similar environments (Ashbolt et al., 2001) . Process indicator organisms include E. coli and F-RNA phage . Alternative targets, such as particles or measuring particle size distributions (PSDs), are also potential process indicators. Analysis using PSD was found to be a useful surrogate method for helminth ova detected in wastewater influents and effluents (Chavez, Jimenez, & Maya, 2004) and was also predictive of pathogen removal in a pilot scalee activated sludge reactor (Keegan et al., 2010) .",

Therefore, indicator organisms such as E. coli have been used as an indicator for other enteric bacteria. The majority of enteric pathogenic bacteria respond to water treatment in a similar fashion to E. coli (Keegan et al., 2010) and hence it was used as a model organism for assessing ultraviolet (UV) inactivation (McElmurry, Ingram, Khalaf, & Pillai, 2011) . E. coli is a Gram negative, rod-shaped bacterium approximately 1.8 mm long and 0.8 mm in diameter, which lives in the gut of warm-blooded animals (Berg, 2004; McElmurry et al., 2011) . It is safe and easy to culture, inexpensive to analyze, and does not generally regrow in wastewater, making it an ideal process indicator for bacterial pathogens when monitoring the efficacy of wastewater treatment processes.",

However, these viruses are pathogenic and norovirus is not readily cultured, requiring highly specialized threedimensional cell culture methods to produce the fully differentiated enterocytes needed to support infection and virus propagation. It has been suggested that fecal bacteriophage (viruses infecting enteric bacteria), such as somatic coliphage and F-specific coliphage, can be indicators for pathogenic viruses Skraber, Gassilloud, Schwartzbrod, & Gantzer, 2004) . However, there is not a universally accepted enteric virus indicator, in part because there is such diversity in virus size, shape, and genome type. Bacteriophage have been used as model organisms because they show similar resistance to disinfection processes as most of the enteric viruses and they also have similar or higher abundance compared to enteric viruses in natural water and wastewater (Ashbolt et al., 2001; Duran et al., 2003; Grabow, 2004) . Phages have been used as models to examine raw and treated drinking water supplies (Grabow, 2004) . F-RNA coliphage, which are viruses that infect coliform bacteria that possess an F plasmid and are actively expressing conjugative F pili, are the most attractive surrogates because their structure, morphology, and composition resembles that of human enteric viruses (Grabow, 2004) . In addition, they are unable to multiply in natural water environments in the absence of actively growing host cells and have similar responses toward disinfectants as human enteric viruses (Grabow, 2004) . MS2 is an F-RNA coliphage that has been used as a model organism for norovirus (Dawson, Paish, Staffell, Seymour, & Appleton, 2005) . E. coli is the host for MS2, which bypasses the need for complex mammalian cell culture for enumeration of MS2 (Dawson et al., 2005) . In addition, MS2 is relatively easy to propagate using E. coli cultures and so can be used for challenge testing if higher numbers of virus are required to validate the performance of treatment processes.",

Clostridium is found in abundance in sewage as it is associated with the feces of warm-blooded animals (Ashbolt et al., 2001) . The small (1 mm) spores, which are 4e10 times smaller than protozoan oocysts or cysts, do not interact with soil grains and in some ways behave like colloids, making them highly resistant to degradation and inactivation (Schijven, De Bruin, Hassanizadeh, & de Roda Husman, 2003) . These spores have been associated with the occurrence of Cryptosporidium oocysts and Giardia cysts in wastewater (Cheng, Broaders, Lucy, Mastitsky, & Graczyk, 2012) and have similar partitioning behavior to Cryptosporidium and Giardia in storm water (Cizek et al., 2008) .

Preliminary treatment typically consists of screening and grit removal and can use bar, drum, cutting, or band screens that are inclined toward the inflowing water and trap objects as the sewage water flows thorugh them (Templeton & Butler, 2011) . The captured debris can be manually or mechanically removed and fibrous materials can be further dewatered. Grit removal involves removing abrasive inorganic materials such as sand, gravels, and other heavy particulate matter, and is necessary to avoid clogging and abrasive damage to the equipment and sewage pipes downstream (Templeton & Butler, 2011) . There are different types of grit channels; velocity channels or aerated channels, which reduce the velocity of influent and allow the heavy abrasives to settle to the bottom before removal. ",

It is generally described as the first level of treatment and removes approximately 50e70% of total suspended solids (TSSs), 65% of oil and grease, and 25e50% of BOD (Sonune & Ghate, 2004) . Major physical modes for separating solids from wastewater are flocculation and sedimentation, which involves settling solids under the influence of gravity (Templeton & Butler, 2011) . The most common sedimentation tanks (also known as clarifiers) are rectangular or circular ( Fig. 3 ) in shape. In rectangular tanks, water enters from one end and leaves from the other end ( Fig. 3A ) whereas in circular tanks water enters from the center and moves outward radially (Fig. 3B ). An important feature of these tanks is a weir. In sedimentation, the speed of water affects settling of solids. Therefore, weirs are carefully designed physical barriers which determine the flow rate (Templeton & Butler, 2011) . Dissolved and colloidal substances are not removed at this stage (Sonune & Ghate, 2004) .",

The heterogeneous microbial culture is termed \"activated sludge\" (Okoh et al., 2007) and the biomass is normally arranged in microbial aggregates called flocs, which are kept in suspension by aeration and mechanical mixing (Seviour & Nielsen, 2010; Sustarsic, 2009 ). The most basic ASP setup for this first stage comprises an aeration tank and an aeration source. However, there are many modifications to this basic design (Fig. 4) to include anoxic and/or anaerobic zones to improve total nitrogen removal by nitrification/denitrification and phosphorous uptake (Fux & Siegrist, 2004; Okoh et al., 2007; Seviour, Mino, & Onuki, 2003; Sustarsic, 2009; Vaiopoulou, Melidis, & Aivasidis, 2007) .",

The clarified supernatant is sent for tertiary treatment, while a large portion of the settled biomass (termed return activated sludge or RAS) is recycled back to the head of the ASP. While the main purpose of an ASP is biological removal and stabilization of nutrients, it is also recognized to be an effective treatment barrier against pathogens via predation (by higher organisms) and by attachment, adsorption or entrapment to or within the biological floc (Bitton, 2005; Keegan et al., 2010; Okoh et al., 2007) . Reports describing the efficacy ASP for pathogen removal vary and this may be related to operational differences between wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and also the effect of season on pathogen density and treatment performance. Removal of E. coli has been reported to be between 1.5 and 2.5 log 10 , while Cryptosporidium removal was reported to be between 1 and 3 log 10 (Keegan et al., 2010; King et al., 2015) . In contrast, removal of viruses varied between different WWTPs and also appeared to be different for some viral species (Keegan et al., 2010) .

The removal of pathogens and the final effluent density of pathogens is also related to pond depth, detention time, number of ponds, and pond geometry (Von Sperling, 2005) . WSPs remove fecal coliforms, E. coli and other pathogenic microorganisms through photooxidative DNA damage arising from sunlight, as well as through other physicochemical factors such as temperature and pH (Davis-Colley, Donnison, & Speed, 2000) . Sunlight and temperature have also been found to inactivate Cryptosporidium suspended in a WSP . Predation by other microorganisms or zooplankton can also contribute to removal of pathogens, especially bacteria and protozoan parasites Stott, May, Matsushita, & Warren, 2001) . WSPs have shown removals of 2e 4 log 10 for viruses, 3e6 log 10 for bacteria, 1e2 log 10 for protozoan cysts (Templeton, Andrews, & Hofmann, 2005 ) and up to a 3 log 10 for helminth eggs (Jim\u00e9nez, Mara, Carr, & Brissaud, 2010) . Protozoan removal in WSPs can be highly seasonal, with higher removal in the summer/autumn months (2.5e3 log 10 ) and lower removal in the winter/spring months (0.5e 1.2 log 10 ) reported for an Australian pond system .",

In general, the density and hence settling velocity of microorganisms is low [e.g., 30 mm/day for Cryptosporidium oocysts (Medema, Schets, Teunis, & Havelaar, 1998) ], so attachment of pathogens to denser particles is required for sedimentation to occur.

Pathogen removal in these ponds is a complex process involving factors such as sedimentation, sunlight-mediated inactivation, high pH, low carbon dioxide, and high oxygen concentrations (Campos et al., 2002) . These ponds consist of different functional layers or zones, namely anaerobic, heterotrophic and photic zones (Bitton, 2010) . The lowest zone is anaerobic and removes sedimented organic matter in the absence of oxygen while producing gases such as methane and carbon dioxide (Faleschini & Esteves, 2011) . In the heterotrophic zone, carbon dioxide stimulates algal growth, which provides oxygen for heterotrophic aerobes to decompose organic matter (Bitton, 2010) . The top or surface zone, also known as the photic zone, is characterized by high rates of algal photosynthesis causing the water to become highly oxygenated. This oxygen is utilized in the aerobic decomposition of organic matter by heterotrophic bacteria (Von Sperling, 2007) . Facultative ponds are generally shallow and range from 1 to 2.5 m in depth, with detention times that range from 5 to 30 days (Bitton, 2010; Shilton, 2005) ",

These are generally shallow ponds that are well mixed to promote the growth of green microalgae (Craggs, Park, Heubeck, & Sutherland, 2014) , which provides reductions in the organic load and pathogen numbers (Araki, Martin-Gomez, Becares, De Luis-Calabuig, & Rojo-Vazquez, 2001 ). An added benefit of HRAP is it can also cause pathogen inactivation, with one study measuring a 97% reduction in Cryptosporidium infectivity (Araki et al., 2001) . In addition to secondary treatment, HRAP provides some tertiary treatment, with the algae removing contaminants such as heavy metals (Ramanan, Kim, Cho, Oh, & Kim, 2016) . While HRAP has a higher energy demand compared with other pond systems, it is relatively low energy and cost-effective compared with other secondary treatment options, especially if energy-efficient paddle mixers are used. HRAP can be used either directly with primary effluent or with wastewater that has been pretreated by anaerobic ponds or clarifiers to remove solids (Craggs et al., 2014) . If carbon is limiting in the wastewater then the performance of HRAP can be enhanced by aeration with CO 2 (Craggs et al., 2014) . There has been increased interest in HRAP as an option for culturing algae for biofuel production, as well as a treatment option for limiting blooms of cyanobacteria since HRAP allows better control of the bacterial/microalgal community compared to WSPs (Ramanan et al., 2016) . The smaller footprint of HRAP systems (compared with WSPs) makes them an attractive option for urban or semiurban regions that are rapidly expanding and require a decentralized sewage treatment option that is low cost with minimal land use.",

The selection of treatment processes is dependent upon the desired end use. In the case of applications such as woodlot or subsurface irrigation, where human contact with the reuse water is unlikely, secondary treated effluent might be suitable without the need for further treatment. However, the tertiary treatment requirements for reuse water increase as the likelihood of human exposure to the reuse water increases. In general, the effluent needs to be treated and/or disinfected sufficiently to reduce pathogen numbers to levels that meet public health safety requirements. These target numbers are determined by risk assessments that consider exposure routes, exposure amounts, infectious doses, and disease outcomes (AGWR, 2006) . Nutrients such as phosphorous can be precipitated out by the addition of lime or alum (Templeton & Butler, 2011) and, less commonly, microalgae (e.g., using HRAP) have also been reported to effectively remove nitrogen and phosphorous (Aslan & Kapdan, 2006) . Pathogens can be physically removed by filtration methods, such as dissolved air flotation filtration or microfiltration for bacteria and protozoans and ultrafiltration for virus removal. Membrane filtration methods are highly effective for the removal of pathogens, especially larger organisms such as protozoa and bacteria (Ottoson et al., 2006) . Filtration has the added benefit of removing particulates to improve downstream disinfection processes that are required to inactivate remaining pathogens.",

            "text": "The final and possibly most important step in tertiary treatment (in terms of microbial safety at least) is the disinfection of the wastewater prior to reuse. UV radiation and chlorination are widely used and well characterized disinfection processes. Chlorine is added to treated wastewater for predetermined periods of time designed to optimize microorganism exposure and inactivation (described in more detail in Section 7.1), following which any residual chlorine is neutralized prior to discharge to the environment or aquifer storage (Templeton & Butler, 2011) . By convention, chlorine disinfection targets are set by contact time, or CT, which is measured as the product of the chlorine dose (in mg/L) and time (in minutes). It is therefore possible to achieve the same CT using a high dose/short time or low dose/long time. The CT is affected by the level of free available chlorine, which is determined by temperature and pH. This is an important consideration since the required CTs for pathogen inactivation are much higher in cold water [e.g., a CT of 8 mg min/L for viruses 5 C, (EPA, 2003) ] than in warmer water [e.g., a CT of 3 mg min/L for viruses 20 C, (EPA, 2003) ]. The CTs for chlorine disinfection of drinking water or wastewater have been determined for the major enteric pathogens and these are defined in many guidelines (AGWR, 2006; EPA, 2003; WHO, 2006) . Achieving the desired CT in reuse water can be more difficult compared with drinking water on account of higher chlorine demand and also due to the formation of chloramine in cases when ammonia is present, both of which make the CT calculation more complex (Keegan, Wati, & Robinson, 2012) . Chloramine is a far less potent oxidant compared to chlorine and requires orders of magnitude higher CTs to achieve the same level of disinfection as chlorine (Keegan et al., 2012) . Common enteric bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, and E. coli, have relatively low chlorine CTs of 1 mg min/L or less (WHO, 2006) . Viruses are also effectively inactivated by chlorine, although they are slightly more resistant compared with enteric bacteria. Chorine is ineffective against some protozoan parasites, particularly Cryptosporidium [CT 15,300 mg min/L for 3 log 10 inactivation, (WHO, 2006) ] and Toxoplasma [CT >144,000 mg min/L, (Wainwright et al., 2007) ].",

However, UV disinfection also tends to be more expensive than chlorination, especially for building the required infrastructure. UV treatment involves exposure of wastewater to a UV-C light source (described in more detail in Section 7.2), usually a UV lamp enclosed in a quartz sleeve within a stainless steel pipe or suspended in a concrete channel (Gadgil, Kazakevicius, & Drescher, 2002) . UV is particularly effective against bacteria and enteric protozoans (Giardia and Cryptosporidium) but some viruses, in particular adenovirus, have high UV resistance (Hijnen, Beerendonk, & Medema, 2006) . A combination of UV and chlorination can be particularly effective, using suitable doses of chlorine for virus inactivation and UV for Cryptosporidium inactivation, allowing the most costeffective use of each treatment technology. Other disinfection methods have also been developed and tested. Ozone has been proven to be effective against viruses, protozoan cysts, and helminth eggs (Paraskeva & Graham, 2002) and peracetic acid has also been considered a strong disinfectant because of its effective bactericidal, fungicidal, sporicidal, and virucidal properties (Kitis, 2004) . Conductive-diamond electrochemical oxidation (CDEO) has proven effective in disinfecting wastewater and a combination of CDEO with ultrasound technology increased the disinfection efficacy by reducing the agglomeration of E. coli cells (Llanos, Cotillas, Ca\u00f1izares, & Rodrigo, 2015) .

It is always essential to monitor turbidity when treating drinking water or wastewater because it interferes with disinfection processes, such as chlorination and UV radiation (Berman, Rice, & Hoff, 1988 ; Dietrich, Ba\u015fa gao glu, Loge, & Ginn, 2003; Madge & Jensen, 2006; Rowe & Abdel-Magid, 1995) . Turbidity can be defined as the optical property of water that causes light shone through the water sample to be scattered rather than absorbed or transmitted (Hannouche et al., 2011) . Turbidity also defines the clarity or cloudiness of water (Madhavi & Rajkumar, 2013) . In wastewater, the suspended matter (particles) contributing to turbidity includes clay, grit, organic or inorganic matter, and algae or other microorganisms (Madhavi & Rajkumar, 2013) . In the effluent of a WWTP after different treatment steps, turbidity provides a measure of the remaining suspended solids or particulate matter in the treated effluent and can provide a measure of treatment performance. High turbidity is associated with the availability of a support medium for the transport of attached pathogenic microorganisms and with increased disinfection demand (Mccoy & Olson, 1986) . Turbidity is an indicator of particulate pollution and can be used to measure and control effluent quality, which is particularly important for effluent discharge since suspended solids can have adverse environmental impacts (Hannouche et al., 2011) . Increases in wastewater turbidity have been associated with increased densities of bacteria, Cryptosporidium oocysts, and Giardia cysts (Crittenden, Trussell, Hand, Howe, & Tchobanoglous, 2012).",

CEPT has been shown to be effective in removing particles in the size range of 20e80 mm; however, it was not effective in removing particles <10 mm, whereas CBF was highly effective at removing particles >5 mm (Zhang et al., 2007) . The majority of organic particles in wastewater are colloidal and supracolloidal; however, after biological treatment (CBF), the remaining organic matter is in the soluble fraction (Garc\u00eda-Mesa et al., 2010) . Particles can transform during biological treatment, with most of the settleable and suspended organic matter metabolized and incorporated into sludge mass or active organisms suspended in the bulk water. This biotransformation of particles also occurs in subsequent secondary or tertiary treatment steps. Most of the settleable and suspended inorganic particles are entangled in the sludge mass, while nonsettleable, nonbiodegradable, or dissolved organic and inorganic particles pass out in the primary effluent (Henze et al., 2008) .",

Flocs are made up of a diverse community of microorganisms and nonliving organic matter, such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which are secreted by microorganisms and play an important role in floc formation (Fig. 8) . Bacteria, fungi, and protozoans attach to the internal and external surfaces of the flocs, which are typically in the size range of 10e1000 mm (Davies, 2005) . Secondary clarifiers remove most of the flocs and the clarified water can be disinfected and discharged to the environment or subjected to tertiary treatment. Particle size analysis of effluent from a conventional secondary clarifier identified with a size range of 1e10 mm (Wu, Jiang, & Wheatley, 2009) . Particle size and load within clarified effluent is influenced by the settling performance of the activated sludge biomass, as poor settling biomass (termed sludge bulking) results in the carryover of high concentrations of suspended solids and attached pathogens, which can also impact negatively on downstream tertiary treatment processes such as filtration and disinfection. Tertiary treatment, depending on the process, further reduces the loads of particulates and organic contaminants, and disinfection is used as the final step to reduce pathogen numbers to below guideline levels for reuse (Shon et al., 2007) .",

Different techniques for measuring the size of particles include microscopy, electrical sensing, light scattering, light obstruction, and membrane filtration (Aguilar, Saez, Llorens, Soler, & Ortuno, 2003) . Analysis by microscopy allows direct visualization of the particles, with measurements typically made using computer-aided image analysis, which can automate both particle sizing and counting from the captured images (Emerick, Loge, Thompson, & Darby, 1999) . The only issue with microscopy is that the sample needs to be dispersed in such a way that large and small particles are uniformly distributed on the slide (Aguilar et al., 2003) . The electrical sensing technique applies voltage across a small orifice through which the particles are passed. The changes in electric potential are directly related to the volume of particles passing (Aguilar et al., 2003) . Coulter counters and multisizers are such instruments, which have been used previously for measuring PSD in raw untreated wastewater samples (Chavez et al., 2004) .",

In the case of light obstruction, the amount of light blocked by a particle is measured as it passes through a sensing zone. A particle analyzer uses this principle and measures the size and quantity of particles that pass through the diode (Jolis, Lam, & Pitt, 2001) . The light scattering method uses a similar principle to flow cytometry, with the magnitude of light deflection around the particle (equivalent to forward scatter) used to estimate particle size (Aguilar et al., 2003) . Instruments such as the Coulter laser granulometer and Sequoia LISST (laser in situ scattering and transmissometry) use this method and have been used to measure PSD in wastewater (Azema et al., 2002; Keegan et al., 2010) . A limitation of the light-based methods is that the optical properties of the particles can affect sizing. Apart from size, the refractive index of a particle will also influence how the light scatters, and some diffraction-based particle analyzers use specific calibration factors for different compounds to improve the accuracy of particle sizing. As a consequence, when measuring the PSD of a water or wastewater sample using light diffraction, it is important to understand the nature of the particles being studied (e.g., are they organic or inorganic, if inorganic what type of material?) to enable the selection of appropriate calibration factors.",

These methods are cheaper and simpler than using PSD analyzers and have the added advantage of collecting the particles for further characterization. This approach is useful for studying the partitioning behavior of chemical or microbial contaminants, which can be measured in the different fractions. For example, particles in a water sample can be stained with a colored dye and filtered using a series of membranes with different pore sizes. Particles captured on the filters can then be observed under a microscope and analyzed by an image analyzer (Dietrich, Loge, Ginn, & Ba\u015fa gao glu, 2007) . When using flat-bed membranes for size exclusion, caution must be employed to avoid overloading the filter and blocking the membrane pores because this results in the capture of particles smaller than the nominal pore size of the membrane, which would lead to erroneous results.",

There are two different types of particlee microorganism interactions; particles physically associated with microorganisms as clumps, and particles not physically associated with microorganisms but providing protection by shielding them from UV light or by contributing to disinfectant demand (Sophonsiri & Morgenroth, 2004) . It has been found that the shielding effect of particles increases with increasing particle size (Madge & Jensen, 2006) . The binding of microorganisms to particles can be through electrostatic attractions, hydrophobic interactions or physical entrapment (Templeton et al., 2005) . The association between microorganisms and particles can change with time, as the formation and disaggregation of biological flocs is a continual process in environmental waters (Malham et al., 2014) . Microorganisms associated with denser particles settle quickly, whilst microorganisms associated with lighter particles tend to stay suspended in water and survive for longer (Characklis et al., 2005) .

            "text": "Overbeck (DLVO) double layer theory (Hipsey, Brookes, Regel, Antenucci, & Burch, 2006; Kristian Stevik et al., 2004) . According to the DLVO theory, bacterial attraction occurs at two zones around a particle, the first (\"primary energy\") is within 1 nm of the particle surface and the second (\"secondary energy\") is within 5e10 nm of the particle surface (Hipsey et al., 2006; Kristian Stevik et al., 2004) . There are consequently two steps involved in the adsorption of bacteria to a particle surface. The first step occurs within the secondary energy zone and is weak and can be reversed (Hipsey et al., 2006; Kristian Stevik et al., 2004) . In this step, the bacterial cell overcomes any repulsive electrostatic forces and adsorbs to the particle's surface. Weak Van der Waal and electrostatic forces contribute to this adsorption and can be easily overcome by other physical forces such as a change in the ionic composition of the medium or hydraulic shear forces (Hipsey et al., 2006; Kristian Stevik et al., 2004) . The second adsorption step, also known as adhesion, occurs within the primary energy zone and is stronger and irreversible. It occurs when the bacterial cell forms a permanent bond with the surface and involves a large amount of energy (Hipsey et al., 2006; Kristian Stevik et al., 2004) . The adhesion can be mediated by extracellular polymers such as EPS, via the formation of by dipoleedipole interactions or hydrogen bonding (Kristian Stevik et al., 2004) . Apart from direct adsorption to a particle surface, bacteria can associate with particles by either harboring in the cracks of particles or by adhering to biofilms (LeChevallier, Hassenauer, Camper, & McFeters, 1984; Winkelmann & Harder, 2009 ). The formation of biofilm requires actively growing bacteria. Considering that pathogenic bacteria are unlikely to replicate under the nutrient and temperature conditions typical of wastewater treatment systems (Keegan et al., 2010) , it is more likely that heterotrophic bacteria will mediate the formation of biofilm or production of EPS and bacterial aggregates, which form a substrate for the binding of pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or protozoans.",

Analysis of rainfall runoff flowing into a drinking water reservoir identified a relationship between turbidity and coliform/E. coli counts, with the strongest correlation (R 2 \u00bc 0.8) being with particles in the size range of 3.2e17 mm (Hipsey et al., 2006) . While the authors speculated that this strong correlation was due to association between the particles and bacteria, analyses (such as size fractionation or microscopy) were not conducted to verify the association. Analysis of bacteria in estuary water demonstrated that the numbers of bacteria associated with particles (measured using 3 mm filters) increased with increased turbidity (Bidle & Fletcher, 1995) .

            "text": "Enteric viruses (15e80 mm) are much smaller than bacteria (1e10 mm) and are generally associated with much smaller particles, less than 10 mm in size (Madge & Jensen, 2006) . The association of viruses with particles ( Fig. 11 ) depends upon the surface charge of the particle and virus charge, morphology, and size (Madge & Jensen, 2006) . Different virus species have different proteins that protect their genome (called a capsid or virus coat), these differences are likely responsible for differences in charge and removal through treatment processes and mediate adsorption to particles. Viruses, depending on species, can be readily adsorbed onto sand particles, clay particles, suspended colloids, transparent extracellular polymer, and fecal matter via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (Mari, Kerros, & Weinbauer, 2007; Templeton, Andrews, & Hofmann, 2007) . These associations increase their survival rates and render them more resistant to disinfection processes (Templeton et al., 2007) . Although there have been many studies of the occurrence of viruses in wastewater (reviewed by Keegan et al. (2010) ), there have been few studies of the association of viruses with particles in wastewater. The association of norovirus with wastewater particles has been successfully demonstrated using cascade filtration of water from a WSP (Silva et al., 2008) . In this report, sets of different-sized filters were used to capture particle-associated norovirus. The filters were then analyzed for the presence of virus to determine the size of particles to which the virus was attached (Silva et al., 2008) . Norovirus, detected using reverse-transcription PCR, were found free in solution and on a wide range of particle sizes, including large settleable particles >180 mm, smaller particles captured on a 0.45-mm filter, and colloidal particles. This finding contrasts with a study of viruseparticle associations in wastewater from an ASP, which used continuous flow centrifugation of filtration to size separate particles and detected enteroviruses using cell culture of buffalo green monkey kidney cells (Hejkal, Wellings, Lewis, & LaRock, 1981) . This study reported minimal association between viruses and large particles, with 72% of virus particles associated with particles <0.3 mm in primary effluent, and 96.6% of virus particles associated with particles <0.3 mm in clarified secondary effluent. As discussed earlier, a possible reason for the differences between the two studies could be the physical differences between the different virus species (norovirus vs enterovirus), although it is also possible that the differences could be due to differences in the particles in activated sludge and pond systems.",

Oocysts and cysts are not thought to attach to inorganic particles in the water column (Dai & Boll, 2003) ; however, considering the effect of organics on oocyst binding in soil it is possible that the organics in wastewater could similarly facilitate binding of oocysts to inorganic particles. The surface charge characteristics of particles and microorganisms can alter during the wastewater treatment processes (Medema et al., 1998) and certain surface macromolecules can hinder the attachment of oocysts to surfaces (Kuznar & Elimelech, 2006) . It is therefore possible that the nature of the interactions can change depending on the stage of treatment. Oocyst age or integrity might also play a role in particle associations. Characterization of oocysts in raw sewage and clarified secondary effluent suggested that damaged, noninfective oocysts were preferentially removed during ASP treatment . In this study, the total number of oocysts decreased following ASP treatment, but the proportion of infectious oocysts in the clarified effluent (31%) increased compared with the proportion of infectious oocysts in the raw sewage (10%), suggesting selective removal of noninfectious oocysts . However, this study did assess if particle binding was responsible for the oocyst removal. While it is possible for oocysteparticle association, a PCR-based detection study suggested that oocysts in secondary effluent were not particle associated (Tsuchihashi, Loge, & Darby, 2003) . The association of protozoan parasites with wastewater particles still requires further investigation to determine if this occurs at different treatment stages and how this might impact oocyst removal and inactivation.",

Chlorine has high oxidizing capacity and is mostly used in high concentrations to kill pathogens, although high dosages can cause the formation of harmful by-products (Virto, Manas, Alvarez, Condon, & Raso, 2005) . Excessive use of chemicals beyond that required to achieve target levels of disinfection is also not cost effective and increases the cost of producing recycled water. Chlorine reacts with the cell membrane and alters or damages vital cell functions (Venkobachar, Iyengar, & Prabhakara Rao, 1977) . Exposure to chlorine causes stress to microorganisms via irreversible cell injuries and in some cases it causes bacteria (e.g., Salmonella typhimurium) to enter a viable nonculturable state if the dose is not high enough to cause outright cell death (Oliver, Dagher, & Linden, 2005) . A major disadvantage of chlorination is that the majority of protozoans with cyst forms (Toxoplasma, C. parvum, and G. duodenalis), helminths, and certain strains of bacteria are highly or moderately resistant to chlorine (Liberti, Notarnicola, & Petruzzelli, 2003) . After disinfection, dechlorination is generally carried out to remove residual chlorine, which increases the overall cost of the process (Lazarova, Savoye, Janex, Blatchley, & Pommepuy, 1999) . This step is critical to protect the environment that receives any wastewater discharges because chlorine and derivatives (e.g., chloramines) are toxic to many aquatic organisms.",

The protective effect is related to the nature of the particle, with organic particles providing more protection compared with inorganic particles (Berman et al., 1988) . Chlorine is able to penetrate particles by radial diffusion (Dietrich et al., 2003; Winward et al., 2008) in a two-step process in which it passes through different boundary layers of the wastewater particle (Fig. 12) . Chlorine penetration of particles is therefore controlled by the initial chlorine concentration, which influences the diffusion rate (Winward et al., 2008) . The presence of organic matter increases the chlorine demand of wastewater; the residual-free chlorine reduces with an increase in the amount of organic matter and reduces the availability of free chlorine for disinfection (Winward et al., 2008) . The presence of organic matter can also stabilize the cell membrane and reduce the sensitivity of bacteria to chlorine by reducing the access of chlorine to the cell membrane (Virto et al., 2005) . Pathogens embedded in a particle are further protected from chlorine due to the presence of the extracellular materials that surround it (Templeton et al., 2005) . The protective effects of particles in terms of chlorine (or other oxidants) therefore can be linked to chlorine demand, membrane stabilization, or the incomplete penetration of the chemical into the particle in the case of embedded pathogens (Dietrich et al., 2007) .",

Tailing is characterized by no further increase in the inactivation of microorganisms even though increased amounts of disinfectant are applied (Liang et al., 2010) . This phenomenon is problematic for the production of reuse water, since the survival of any pathogens or key process indicators will mean that the water is not fit for use and will require additional treatment to make it safe. Therefore, it is important to tailor the treatment processes so that disinfection processes can work with maximum efficiency, minimizing the chlorine dose required and any the residual chlorine, as well as minimizing the number of surviving cells.",

UV radiation is preferred to chlorine because it does not cause the formation of toxic by-products (Hassen et al., 2000; Lazarova et al., 1999) . The UV light spectrum can be split into UV-C (200e280 nm), UV-B (280e320 nm), and UV-A (320e400 nm), with only UV-C used for disinfection (King, Hoefel, Daminato, Fanok, & Monis, 2008) . The other components of UV (UV-B and UV-A) occur in natural sunlight. Key biological components required by microorganisms are DNA and RNA, these molecules absorb light at 260e280 nm and so can be damaged by UV. The germicidal wavelength of UV light is 254 nm, which is the wavelength that causes maximum DNA damage by inducing DNA adducts called thymine dimers, which hinder normal transcriptional and DNA replication processes and prevent cell division (Gehr, Wagner, Veerasubramanian, & Payment, 2003) . Other wavelengths of UV across the spectrum cause cell death by damaging critical proteins that are required for cell function (King et al., 2008) . There are two types of UV lamps used for disinfection, low-pressure UV lamps, which produce UV light around 254 nm, and medium-pressure lamps, which produce UV light of range 200e300 nm (Chen, Craik, & Bolton, 2009; Craik, Weldon, Finch, Bolton, & Belosevic, 2001) .",

There are two main formats for UV reactors, open channels, where UV lamps encased in quartz sleeves are suspended in the channel as water flows through it, and closed pipe systems, which are normally constructed of stainless steel with the lamps enclosed in a quartz sleeve and sited in the middle of the pipe (Hassen et al., 2000; Lazarova et al., 1999; Templeton & Butler, 2011) . UV disinfection has been shown to be very effective for the inactivation of pathogenic protozoans such as C. parvum and G. duodenalis, with UV doses of 25 mJ/cm 2 resulting in 3 log 10 reduction of Cryptosporidium oocysts and doses of 40 mJ/cm 2 have shown 4 log 10 reduction of G. duodenalis (Craik et al., 2001; Linden, Shin, Faubert, Cairns, & Sobsey, 2002) . Many studies have shown that low pressure UV doses of 30e40 mJ/cm 2 can cause 4 log 10 inactivation of pathogenic viruses; however, a high dose of 200 mJ/cm 2 is required to inactivate (4 log 10 ) adenoviruses (Eischeid, Meyer, & Linden, 2009 ). In the case of adenovirus, medium pressure UV is more effective, with a lower wavelength around 220 nm associated with the inactivation (Chen et al., 2009 ). UV has also been shown to cause 0e1.5 log 10 reduction of Ascaris lumbricoides eggs, which are one of the most resistant pathogens to other disinfection processes (Brownell & Nelson, 2006) .",

Particles around 10 mm affect disinfection because they are capable of shielding embedded bacteria from UV radiation. In addition, some smaller particles (such as inorganic silica) can scatter the UV light and limit light penetration through the reactor, protecting microorganisms. Larger particles can be easily removed by filtration prior to disinfection in drinking water treatment facilities (Templeton et al., 2005) .

            "text": "Smaller particles can easily pass through filters, and viruses are associated with these smaller particles (Hejkal et al., 1981) . However, these smaller particles tend to provide less shielding, although this is dependent on whether the particle is organic or inorganic (Jolis et al., 2001; Templeton et al., 2005) . Bacteria can contribute to the formation of particles by forming aggregates, a natural phenomenon known as bioflocculation. This is often mediated by EPS, which not only holds the bacterial floc together but also provides protection to the enmeshed bacteria by absorbing UV radiation. Consequently, bacterial flocs are also a cause of tailing (Farnood, 2014) . The formation of flocs can be related to the density of microorganisms, and similar aggregation can also occur in the absence of EPS when there are high densities of virus particles or protozoan (oo)cysts. This aggregation of microorganisms presents a challenge for measuring UV doseeresponsesdif the number of organisms used in experimental systems is too high then tailing caused by aggregation occurs and the dose response will not be correctly determined. In addition, the aggregation of microorganisms confounds culture-based enumeration and affects the accuracy of direct counting methods such as microscopy of flow cytometry.",

To realize these benefits, wastewater needs to be treated sufficiently to ensure that it is affordable while still protecting public health. This is an important consideration because without public confidence in recycled water it will not be accepted, but at the same time if it is too expensive then consumers will use the cheapest water available, which is often surface water or groundwater.",

While chemical contaminants are also important, health regulators tend to focus on contaminants that cause acute disease, especially in the context of nonpotable reuse of wastewater when chronic human exposure is unlikely. With this in mind, an understanding of the fate of pathogens through wastewater treatment and disinfection processes, as well as knowledge of the factors that influence these processes, is required to ensure optimal treatment for managing the risk from pathogens in wastewater. One of the major influencing factors on the fate of pathogens in water is association with particles. It is therefore important to understand the nature of pathogeneparticle associations, the factors influencing formation and stability of the association and how the association affects treatment disinfection processes.",

However, there have been few studies characterizing particles in wastewater and the nature of the associations between pathogens and particles in wastewater remains a knowledge gap. Similarly, there have been studies on the impact of particles on the disinfection of some pathogens or pathogen indicators in wastewater, but these have not examined the nature of the pathogeneparticle interactions and how these affect disinfection. Future studies need to characterize particles and pathogeneparticle interactions along different stages of the wastewater treatment train, to provide a better understanding of how the different treatment steps influence the nature of the particles present and their interaction with pathogens. A better understanding of this behavior may identify ways to modify processes to alter pathogen partitioning or identify other treatment strategies for dealing with particle-associated pathogens. Controlling pathogeneparticle associations provides an opportunity to enhance wastewater treatment and reduce treatment costs; increased levels of association can enhance removal by sedimentation processes, reduced levels of association can enhance disinfection.",
