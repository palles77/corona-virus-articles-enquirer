Viral RNA in patient samples was tested using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. Antibodies against H7N9 virus in serum samples were tested using hemagglutination inhibition and pseudovirus based neutralization assays. Results: All household contacts were extensively exposed to the case-patients without the use of measures to protect against infection. Viral RNA was detected in the specimens from case-patients for approximately 7-11 days after confirmation of infection. However, the results of the analyses of serum specimens taken from the household contacts 15-26 days post exposure revealed no evidence of transmission of H7N9 virus from the case-patients to the contacts. Conclusion: Despite ample unprotected exposures to case-patients during the virus shedding period, household members in this report were not infected by the H7N9 virus.",

Being frequently exposed to case-patients during the contagious phase, household contacts are at a high risk for infection. Similar to infection with seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, a substantial number of H7N9 virus infected individuals are estimated to manifest mild to moderate symptoms [2, 3] . Case ascertainment among most of the contacts in previous large epidemiologic reports has been mostly based on clinical symptoms and detection of virus using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay [3, 4] . This approach may not detect the asymptomatic cases or the individuals that have cleared the virus. Detection of antibodies to H7N9 virus in serum specimens may reveal these undetected cases and may provide new information that aids in the understanding of the transmission of this novel influenza virus among humans. Here we report the results of epidemiologic investigations and serologic findings on household contracts for three H7N9 infected patients hospitalized at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center (SHAPHC), China [5] .",

Our investigation suggests that for cases reported in this study, the H7N9 virus was not transmitted from the case-patients to their household contacts after prolonged and unprotected exposure. Consistent with the observations in studies of H7N9 virus transmission in animal models, our results indicate that compared with globally disseminated seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, the H7N9 virus is not readily transmitted in certain household settings [10] [11] [12] [13] .",
