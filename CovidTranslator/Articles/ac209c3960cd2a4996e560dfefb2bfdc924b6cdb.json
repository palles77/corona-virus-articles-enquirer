            "text": "N-myc oncogene amplification is associated but not present in all cases of high-risk neuroblastoma (NB). Since oncogene expression could often modulate sensitivity to oncolytic viruses, we wanted to examine if N-myc expression status would determine virotherapy efficacy to high-risk NB. We showed that induction of exogenous N-myc in a non-N-myc-amplified cell line background (TET-21N) increased susceptibility to oncolytic vesicular stomatitis virus (mutant VSV\u0394M51) and alleviated the type I IFN-induced antiviral state. Cells with basal N-myc, on the other hand, were less susceptible to virus-induced oncolysis and established a robust IFN-mediated antiviral state. The same effects were also observed in NB cell lines with and without N-myc amplification. Microarray analysis showed that N-myc overexpression in TET-21N cells downregulated IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) with known antiviral functions. Furthermore, virus infection caused significant changes in global gene expression in TET-21N cells overexpressing N-myc. Such changes involved ISGs with various functions. Therefore, the present study showed that augmented susceptibility to VSV\u0394M51 by N-myc at least involves downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions and alleviation of the IFNstimulated antiviral state. Our studies suggest the potential utility of N-myc amplification/overexpression as a predictive biomarker of virotherapy response for high-risk NB using IFN-sensitive oncolytic viruses.",

            "text": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common cancer in the first years of life, and the most common solid tumor of childhood. Patients are risk-stratified using a combination of clinical, pathological, and molecular characteristics. The survival of patients with high-risk disease has not improved and remains less than 60%. 1 Historically, standard therapy for high-risk disease includes chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, and bone marrow transplant, which appear to provide some control of disease progression, but is complicated by significant morbidity and mortality. 2, 3 Innovative approaches such as GD-2 antibody-mediated immune therapy have demonstrated the first improvements in survival for high-risk NB patients in over two decades, though mechanisms limiting its efficacy still occur. 4 Therefore, novel approaches to this disease are necessary. Viral oncolysis is a novel approach to NB that has shown promise in various preclinical cancer models. 5, 6 Despite their promise as therapeutics, oncolytic viruses (OVs) face application hurdles due to our incomplete understanding of the role of the tumor microenviroment and antiviral immune responses on virotherapy. In general, OVs can selectively kill tumor cells while leaving normal cells intact. 7 They achieve this by exploiting the same cellular defects that promote tumor growth. One of such defects is the type I interferon (IFN) signaling, which sensitizes tumor cells to IFN-sensitive OVs such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Newcastle disease virus. [8] [9] [10] In this study, we used VSV based on its known efficacy as a potent oncolytic agent to several tumor types. [11] [12] [13] The deletion of a single amino acid of the M-protein (VSV\u0394M51) increases safety by restricting its infection to cancer cells with defects in type I IFN response. 13, 14 However, tumors with functional type I IFN signaling can hamper its clinical application. 12 N-myc amplification, although not present in all cases, 15 is the best-characterized aberrant genetic alteration associated with poor prognosis in high-risk NB. 16 The mechanisms whereby MYC proteins (c-myc, N-myc and L-myc) sensitize cancer cells to OVs remain unexplored. Previous studies have shown that some c-myc-amplified cancer cell lines are highly susceptible to VSV-induced cell killing. 17 Though not studied in the context of oncolytic virotherapy, c-myc negatively regulates type I IFN signaling through STAT-1, which is one of the mechanisms of pathogenesis in Burkitt's lymphoma and uveal melanoma. 18, 19 Since oncogenic expression often correlates with increased susceptibility of cancer cells to OVs [20] [21] [22] and the effects of N-myc on virotherapy are unknown, we reasoned that N-myc overexpression, due to amplification, could be a clinically important biomarker of virotherapy efficacy to high-risk NB. We showed that N-myc-amplified NB cell lines and a non-N-myc-amplified cell line (TET-21N) induced Since VSV infection induces the expression of type I IFNs, 27 we hypothesized that N-myc-driven regulation of these cytokines promoted differential susceptibility of all NB cells to virus-induced cell killing. As positive controls for these assays, cells were treated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C) for 12 hours. Poly I:C is a strong inducer of type I IFNs when delivered intracellularly (transfection) or extracellularly (in cell culture medium). Intracellular and extracellular poly I:C mainly activate the retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I) and toll-like receptor-3 (TLR-3) signaling, respectively, for the expression of type I IFNs. 28 Cells were either infected at MOI of 0.1 or treated with poly I:C (intracellular and extracellular) and cells and cell culture supernatants were harvested at indicated time points. Secreted IFN-\u03b2 was detected and quantified by ELISA while RT-PCR was used to detect the transcription of IFNs-\u03b1 and -\u03b2.",

This cytokine was best detected at 18 hpi and thus our analysis was focused at this time point (Figure 2a) . IFN-\u03b2 levels increased in the TET-21 cells in response to infection, except for TET-21C (dox -). However, the increased levels of this cytokine did not differ significantly to basal levels (P > 0.05), except for, surprisingly, TET-21C (dox +). IFN-\u03b2 levels increased upon stimulation with poly I:C, either intracellular or extracellular ( Figure 2b ). Interestingly, the increased levels of this cytokine in TET-21N (high N-myc) did not significantly differ to basal levels (P > 0.05). In contrast, endogenous levels of IFN-\u03b2 significantly increased in TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) upon poly I:C treatment (P < 0.05). IFN-\u03b2 levels in virus-infected and poly I:C-treated TET-21N (high N-myc) did not differ significantly (P > 0.05). In contrast, levels of this cytokine in poly I:C-treated TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) were significantly higher than levels observed in virus-infected cells (P < 0.05). These observations collectively suggest that, regardless of N-myc expression status, virus infection does not seem to induce enough levels of IFN-\u03b2 to stimulate the antiviral state in cells, while N-myc seems to have negative effects in the expression of this cytokine when stimulated with poly I:C. At the transcriptional level, significant increases of IFN-\u03b2 was observed upon infection and intracellular poly I:C. Interestingly, IFN-\u03b2 transcript levels were lower in TET-21N (high N-myc) than those in TET-21N (low N-myc) (Supplementary Figure S2a ). Transcription of IFN-\u03b1 was detected upon infection and stimulation with extracellular poly I:C in TET-21N (high and low N-myc) but not in TET-21C cells (Dox-/+).

Activation of this pathway results in phosphorylation of STAT-1 and STAT-2 at tyrosine 701 and 690, which allows them to heterodimerize and translocate into the nucleus to associate with IRF-9 and form the ISGF-3 complex. ISGF-3 activates promoters for the expression of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). The collective contribution of ISGs renders cells in the antiviral state. 29 We therefore studied the IFN signaling through Jak/STAT by analyzing the expression of the ISGF-3 complex and activation of STATs 1 and 2 by phosphorylation. We analyzed the expression of RIG-I as readout for the induction of the Jak/STAT signaling. Cells were infected at MOI of 0.1 and harvested at indicated time points before cytopathic effects were apparent, and components of the ISGF-3 complex were analyzed by western blot. As controls for these assays, cells were treated with exogenous IFN-\u03b2 (200 U/ml) and extracellular poly I:C. Intracellular poly I:C was not included in the analysis due to its poor induction of the Jak/STAT signaling in TET-21 cells, based on STAT-1 and RIG-I expression (Supplementary Figure S3) .",

Virus infections in TET-21 cells did not induce significant changes in the levels of the ISGF-3 Figure 1 Effects of N-myc overexpression on VSV\u0394M51 spread and oncolysis. Human-derived neuroblastoma (NB) cell lines consisting of N-myc-amplified cells (IMR-5, IRM-32 and LAN-1) and non-N-myc-amplified cells (SK-N-SH, SK-N-AS, and SH-EP) were seeded in 35 mm cell culture dishes. The number of cells for each cell line was calculated to achieve 80-90% confluency and the multiplicity of infection (MOI) (0.5) was calculated accordingly. After infection with VSV\u0394M51 (MOI of 0.5) for 1 hour at RT, cells were washed five times with serum-free medium followed by incubation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. Aliquots of culture supernatants were collected at indicated time points for virus titration in BHK cells and generation of multi-step growth curves. Virus production was normalized and titers were expressed as numbers of pfu/1 \u00d7 10 5 cells (y axis) (a). To examine the virus-induced killing rates, the analyzed cells were seeded in 96-well plates and infected at MOI of 0.5. Viability was determined by Alamar Blue at indicated time points (b). Before infection, TET-21 cells were seeded in 35 mm cell culture dishes and treated or not with 1 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline (dox) for 48 hours. Subsequently, cells were infected with VSV\u0394M51 (MOI of 0.5) and cell culture supernatants were collected at indicated time points for virus titration in BHK cells and generation of multi-step growth curves. Virus titers were expressed as numbers of pfu/1 \u00d7 10 5 cells (y axis) (c,d).

However, at 18 and 24 hpi, its levels slightly increased and decreased in TET-21N (high N-myc) and TET-21N (low N-myc), respectively. These observations suggest that VSV\u0394M51 does not induce robust changes in the Jak/STAT signaling in TET-21 cells, probably due to insufficient levels of IFN-\u03b2 expression. Treatments with IFN-\u03b2 or extracellular poly I:C upregulated the expression of IRF-9, RIG-I and STAT-1 and significantly increased the levels of phospho-STAT-1 (Y701 and S727) and STAT-2 (Y690) in TET-21 cells regardless of N-myc expression status ( Figure 2c) . Furthermore, the level of these proteins were similar between cells with low and high N-myc. Relative to TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox-/+), RIG-I levels were slightly lower in TET-21N (high N-myc) after treatment with IFN-\u03b2 or poly I:C (Figure 2c ). These observations suggest that the Jak/STAT signaling is functional regardless of N-myc expression status.",

Cells were either treated or not with poly I:C and IFN-\u03b2 (200 U/ml) for 12 and 6 hours, respectively, followed by virus infection (MOI of 5) at indicated time points. As expected, infection of control cells resulted in cell death. Interestingly, treatment of TET-21N (high N-myc) with exogenous IFN-\u03b2 induced a weak antiviral state insufficient to protect cells from virus-induced cell killing during the course of the experiment (Figure 3a ). In contrast, TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) established a robust antiviral state that fully protected cells from virus-induced cell killing (Figure 3a To further investigate the negative effects of N-myc expression on the establishment of the antiviral state, we studied the antiviral activity of conditioned media from poly I:C-treated TET-21 cells. We also included conditioned media from TET-21 cells infected with VSV\u0394M51 at 18 hpi, which was UV treated for 5 minutes to inactivate virus. SK-N-AS cells (non-N-myc-amplified) were used as indicators due to their ability to establish a robust antiviral state as demonstrated in this work and by others. 30 Since extracellular poly I:C Figure 3 Effects of N-myc on the establishment of the antiviral state. TET-21N and TET-21C cells were either pretreated or not with 1 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline (Dox +/-) and incubated for 48 hours. Cells were then treated with either 200 U/ml IFN-\u03b2 (a,b) or extracellular poly I:C (c,d) for 6 and 12 hours, respectively, followed by virus infection at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5. Viability was determined with Alamar Blue at indicated time points. NB cell lines were transfected with 2.5 ng (in a 24-well plate format) or treated with 10 \u03bcg/ml poly I:C for 12 hours. Alternatively, cells were treated with exogenous IFN-\u03b2 (200 U/ml) for 6 hours. Cells were subsequently infected with VSV\u0394M51 at MOI of 5 (e,f). Viability was determined with Alamar Blue. Error bars correspond to mean \u00b1 standard deviation of the mean from three replicates. Dox (-), no doxycycline added. Dox (+), doxycycline added. Microarray analysis and identification of ISGs Since N-myc levels correlated to the differential susceptibility to virus-induced cell killing, we then sought to perform microarray assays in TET-21N cells to study the N-myc-driven global changes in gene expression in response to infection. For these assays, we used VSV\u0394M51-GFP to monitor virus infection based on GFP expression. Upon optimization, we found that infections at MOI of 0.5 for 18 hours were the most suitable for microarray analysis for the following reasons: (i) Earlier and later time points showed limited infection to TET-21N (low N-myc) and extensive cytopathic effects in TET-21N (high N-myc), respectively; (ii) infections, based on GFP expression, reached between 50-60% of cells with limited cytopathic effects in TET-21N (high N-myc) (not shown); and (iii) infections with RNA viruses at high MOIs are known to interfere with the microarray analysis. 31 Comparisons were made as follows: group 1, TET-21N (low N-myc, infected/uninfected); group 2, TET-21N (high N-myc, infected/uninfected); and group 3, TET-21N controls (high N-myc/low N-myc). Figure 4 illustrates the comparison groups and the numbers of identified probe sets (numbers in black). A total of 60 and 670 probe sets were identified in TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21N (high N-myc), respectively, in response to infection. These data suggest that the higher number of changes in TET-21N (high N-myc) in response to infection seems to correlate to the increased susceptibility to virus-induced cell killing.",

To validate our findings, cells were infected with VSV\u0394M51 at MOI of 0.5 for 12, 18, and 24 hours. As controls for DDIT-3/CHOP expression, cells were either treated or not with 1 \u03bcg/ml tunicamycin (an ER poison) for 18 and 24 hours.

Tunicamycin treatment robustly induced DDIT-3/ CHOP in all cells regardless of N-myc expression status (Figure 5a) . We further validated our findings in the analyzed NB cell lines. At the protein level, DDIT-3/CHOP could not be detected despite several attempts. At the transcriptional level, DDIT-3/CHOP in response to infection varied among the analyzed NB cells regardless of N-myc expression status (Figure 5b ). For example, slight upregulation of DDIT-3/CHOP was observed in LAN-1 (N-myc-amplified) and SK-N-AS (non-N-myc-amplified) while no changes were observed in IMR-32 (N-myc-amplified) and SH-EP (non-N-myc-amplified).

It is now understood that the interaction of cancer cells and stroma contribute to cancer progression, metastasis, resistance to chemo drugs, recurrence after treatment, 39, 40 and resistance to virotherapy. 41 Due to the highly heterogeneous nature of NB, it is not surprising if some subpopulations of tumor cells with differences in permissiveness to virus infection or functional IFN signaling would hamper the virotherapy efficacy. We performed in vitro assays to study N-myc expression, virus susceptibility, and innate immunity in the context of virotherapy for NB. In this study, we used TET-21N cells, which have been a powerful system to study N-myc in NB biology. 26 This cell system allows the overexpression of N-myc at will by adding and removing tetracycline from the cell culture medium (Tet-OFF system). However, limitations of this system include the use of tetracycline, known to alter the cellular gene expression and thus confound microarray analysis, 42 and the lack of tumorigenic capacity of TET-21N (low N-myc) to perform in vivo studies in mice. 43 Tetracycline seemed to have had a major effect on IFN-\u03b2 expression in TET-21C (Dox +) in response to infection, though the expression of this cytokine by poly I:C treatment, virus replication, virus-induced cell killing and establishment of the antiviral state did not seem to have been affected by this antibiotic. Furthermore, SK-N-AS cells were not protected by conditioned media from infected TET-21C (Dox +) cells (not shown) suggesting limited effects of doxycycline in virus-induced cell killing. Although cautious interpretation of data from the Tet-system (ON and OFF) is paramount, many of the microarray hits from TET-21N cells (ArrayEpress, accession number E-MEXP-2340) have been validated. 26, 44 Some validated hits such as c-myc 45 and some Wnt signaling pathway genes 46 were consistent with our microarray data. Although we did not include TET-21C in our microarray analysis and the effects of tetracycline could not be ruled out, validation of some hits (STAT-2, IRF-9, c-myc and IFITM10) by semiquantitative RT-PCR in both TET-21N and TET-21C confirmed our microarray analysis (not shown).",

In this study, we found that N-myc did not cause significant changes in the levels of virus replication, either in the analyzed NB or TET-21 cells. However, N-myc-amplified cells and TET-21N (high N-myc) had increased susceptibility to virusinduced cell killing and failed to establish a robust antiviral state induced by exogenous IFN or poly I:C (either extracellular or intracellular). Virus infection did not cause serious changes in the Jak/ STAT signaling, probably due to insufficient levels of secreted IFN-\u03b2. Treatments with exogenous IFN-\u03b2 or poly I:C, on the other hand, caused significant changes in the expression and phosphorylation levels of these proteins regardless of N-myc expression status. Overall, our western blot and microarray data suggest that N-myc overexpression does not affect the IFN signaling through Jak/STAT pathway directly but rather the expression of some ISGs stimulated by this pathway. Therefore, these findings suggest that the increased susceptibility of NB cells to VSV\u0394M51 and alleviation of type I IFN-induced antiviral state by N-myc at least involves the downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions.",

Most of the identified ISGs have unknown antiviral functions, but it is highly likely that the collective contribution of ISGs and non-ISGs further sensitizes cells to virus infection and alleviates the IFN-stimulated antiviral state. Interestingly, DDIT-3/CHOP, known for its proapoptotic function, was the most highly upregulated ISG in TET-21N (high N-myc) in response to infection. This finding, confirmed by western blot, suggested a possible link between N-myc and DDIT-3/CHOP. However, the expression of DDIT-3/CHOP in response to infection was cell line-dependent regardless of N-myc expression status. Since NB is a highly heterogeneous malignancy, it would not be surprising if this link were restricted to the TET-21 cell system or, perhaps, other NB cell populations. The same seems to be true for the link between N-myc and type I IFN transcription in response to infection and poly I:C treatment (Supplementary Figure S2b) . Though our studies with the TET-21 cell system and NB cell lines suggest a link between N-myc and the observed effects on virus susceptibility and establishment of the IFN-induced antiviral state, such link may not be true for all NB cell populations.

            "text": "In summary, we show that N-myc-amplified cells and cells induced to overexpress N-myc were more susceptible to virus-induced cell killing and failed to establish a robust antiviral state by type I IFN. High N-myc levels correlated with increases in susceptibility to virus-induced cell killing and changes in global gene expression. Our data suggest that N-myc-driven downregulation of ISGs with antiviral functions may be some of the mechanisms promoting differential virus-induced cell killing. These studies suggest that N-myc amplification, a hallmark of high-risk neuroblastoma, can be a potential biomarker of VSV\u0394M51 response, while virotherapy efficacy in high-risk disease with non-N-myc amplification may be suboptimal. Therefore, oncolytic virotherapy for high-risk NB with no N-myc amplification would probably require sensitization of tumors with chemo drugs prior to infection. Development of syngeneic models with isogenic cell lines expressing low and high N-myc levels would provide insights into functional relationships between tumor and stroma, which may determine the virotherapy efficacy in vivo. Viruses and infections VSV\u0394M51, a genetically modified VSV strain derived from the Indiana serotype of VSV, 14 was propagated on BHK cells. This mutant virus has a deletion of methionine 51 in the M protein and insertion of an extra cistron encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) between the G and L sequences. 14 Cells were infected at indicated multiplicity of infections (MOIs) and cell culture supernatants were collected at various time points for virus titration in BHK cells. Virus growth curves (one-and multi-step) and Alamar blue assays (Invitrogen, Frederik, MD) were carried out to study virus replication and spread and cell viability, respectively.",

Cells were then incubated in fresh DMEM medium without serum for another 12 hours. Cell culture supernatants were harvested, centrifuged and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was added to 5% final concentration. Alternatively, cell culture supernatants were fourfold concentrated and FBS was added. Both concentrated and nonconcentrated supernatants from poly I:C-and virus-infected cells were used as conditioned media. SK-N-AS cells were incubated in either conditioned media or regular medium (5% FBS) for 24 hours followed by infection (MOI of 5) for another 48 hours. Nonconcentrated conditioned media, from controls, virus-infected or poly I:C-treated TET-21 cells, did not protect SK-N-AS from virus-induced cell killing (not shown). Treatment of SK-N-AS with concentrated conditioned media from poly I:C-treated TET-21N (low N-myc) and TET-21C (dox -/+) established a robust antiviral state (SupplementaryFigure S4a,b). Interestingly, concentrated conditioned media from poly I:C-treated TET-21N (high N-myc) did not protect SK-N-AS from virus-induced cell killing (SupplementaryFigure S4a). Conditioned media from infected TET-21 cells did not protect SK-N-AS from virus-induced cell killing (not shown).
