In addition to the transplacental route, an infant may acquire CMV during passage through the birth canal, from breast milk, or from blood transfusion [13] . Most infections are asymptomatic; only about 10% of infected infants have clinical disease. The characteristic features are hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, petechiae, thrombocytopenia, pneumonia, chorioretinitis, and brain damage, including periventricular calcification and microcephaly. Infants with CMV usually are small for gestional age, reflecting intrauterine growth retardation. Gastrointestinal (GI) signs and symptoms have rarely been noted or emphasized. However, in 1981 Dimmick presented clear pathologic evidence implicating CMV as a cause of hypoganglionosis and bowel dysmotility in an infant [4] ; a total of four cases have been documented to date [5, 17] .",

At 2 days of age, he received a double -volume exchange transfusion for hyperbilirubinemia. His urine was positive for CMV at 5 weeks. He had three episodes of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Pneumatosis intestinalis was present on X-rays of the abdomen. During the third episode of NEC, at 6 weeks of age, he developed pneumoperitoneum. At operation, a focal ileal perforation was exteriorized as an ileostomy. His postoperative course was characterized by prolonged ileus and thrombocytopenia.

Only a few pediatric cases have been reported. Victoria et al. described a 16-month-old child with AIDS who developed pyloric obstruction from an extensive inflammatory infiltrate of the pyoloric epithelium and muscle by CMV [20] . Dimmick and Bove described three infants with CMV infection of the bowel. Infected enteric ganglion cells were found in two of the infants, one of whom had hypoganglionosis and colonic dysmotility. The third infant had classic short-segment Hirschsprung's disease and colitis, believed to be acquired from CMV infection [5] . A similar case in a 2-month-old child with CMV infection of the myenteric plexus was reported from France [17] . The microscopic features of CMV infection consist of cytolysis, focal necrosis, and inflammatory response featuring the pathognomonic enlarged cells with intranuclear inclusions (cytomegalic cells) [13] (Fig. 2) . Healing results in fibrosis and often calcification, which may cause structural damage to developing organs in the fetus. Vasculitis and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) may occur [18] .",

In case 1, the jejunoileal atresia may have been related to intrauterine vasculitis of the developing midgut. In case 2, ileal perforation occurred in an infant with CMV and NEC. Other intestinal vi-ruses that have been associated with NEC are Coxsackie B2 [7] , rotavirus [15] , and coronavirus [2] . The pathogenesis of NEC in these instances may be by mucosal injury from the virus, which then permits invasion of the gut wall by gas-forming enteric bacteria [10] . In case 3, the gastrointestinal manifestations of CMV mimicked total colonic Hirschsprung's disease and in case 4, NEC. The presentations in cases 3 and 4 were probably secondary to CMV colitis with superimposed Gram-negative bacterial sepsis. The postoperative course of three of our four infants was characterized by prolonged ileus, thrombocytopenia, GI bleeding, and failure to thrive. These manifestations led to clinical suspicion of intestinal obstruction or intra-abdominal abscess, but no obstruction or abscess was ever found on multiple contrast studies of the bowel or radiographic scans. Platelet transfusions caused only transient improvement in the thrombocytopenia. Two infants subsequently died with disseminated CMV infection. Proctosigmoidoscopy and biopsy might have documented CMV colitis, ganglionitis, or hypoganglionisis in all four infants, but we failed to perform the procedure because we recognized the association only in retrospect.",

The diagnosis of CMV infection can be made by culture of the virus from urine, other body fluids, or tissue specimens. Serologic diagnosis is made by demonstration of IgM antibodies or persistent or rising IgG antibodies to CMV. Flexible proctosigmoidoscopy is feasible and indicated in infants with suspected colitis. Rectal suction biopsies should be evaluated for both the presence of ganglion cells and of viral colitis and ganglionitis. Repeat biopsies may be diagnostic in infants in whom abdominal distention persists. Because the reported cases of ganglion-cell infection and/or destruction have always involved the distal colon [5, 17] , a decompressive colostomy or ileostomy might be beneficial in severe cases of CMV colitis.",
