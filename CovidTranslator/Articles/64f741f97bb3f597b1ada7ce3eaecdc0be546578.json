This term arose from the notion that major reaction pathways in the living cell are carried out by specific subsets of the proteome. Time-ordered interaction and complex formation within these ensembles of macromolecules facilitate an autonomous function. Functional modules include the important group of macromolecular machines organised as a compact structure, such as the ribosome or the proteasome. However, there are also ensembles that are more dynamic by changing their composition and/or organisation during function. To include the latter group as well, the term \"functional module\" is used. Common to all modules are a characteristic time domain at which the respective functional cycle proceeds and a certain sequestration from the rest of the cell by spatial limitations, by chemical specificity, and/or by the time domain at which function proceeds.",

            "text": "In terms of systems analysis [1] , functional modules mean ensembles of molecular elements that are integral parts of a network but can be separated from its other parts. The separation is not only a method to facilitate the quantitative analysis of interaction data. It is rather supposed to reflect biological reality in the sense of the general definition of module as \"a self-contained unit of a system that performs a specific task in support of its major function\". Specific network motifs such as \"hubs\" or \"cliques\" can now be assigned to stable or dynamic protein complexes [2] . An alternative to such a \"holistic\" systems approach is a \"bottom up\" approach that starts from known properties of the single macromolecules and their interactions and attempts to reconstruct the behaviour of macromolecular assemblies from the behaviour of their elements. This approach is based on the methods and concepts of molecular biology, biochemistry and biophysics. It is naturally limited to small ensembles but has the potential to elucidate how the system's performance arises from the combination of its microscopic molecular properties. This becomes most important when the biological function of the module depends crucially on a specific molecular detail and/or a specific time window. Examples include the \u03b3-secretase module, in which specific key amino acids determine the kinetics and extent of monomer assembly and eventually the toxicity of the whole polymer [3] . Another example are signal transduction modules, where the functional cycle comprises sequential interactions, which areoften with GTPases as timersonly activated in certain time windows. Also mechano-chemical GTPases of the dynamin superfamily employ nucleotide binding and hydrolysis to set a sophisticated time window in which their self-assembly, their membrane remodelling activity and their disassembly are coordinated (Oliver Daumke, personal communication).",

The first case includes the macromolecular machines with compact structure, such as the ribosome or the proteasome, while the latter case includes signal transducers and intracellular transport vesicles. Oriented on the machines, we assume that modules go through functional cycles. On receiving an input, only one (or a few) elements are initially activated. Subsequently the elements involved increase in their number and may form transient structures of higher hierarchy, each performing a well-defined subtask. This is the submodular level, which performs regulatory functions such as checking the input, signal amplification or negative feedback, which cannot be performed by single elements. On the modular level the submodular contributions are integrated and the output is generated. Towards the end of the functional cycle more and more elements are deactivated until eventually all elements of the module are back in place again [4] .",

The different steps are accomplished by submodular entities, which work together in a coordinated process. These include the sorting of cargo, the budding and scission of the vesicle from the donor membrane, the uncoating, and finally the tethering, docking and membrane fusion at the acceptor compartment [4, 5] . Each transport step, e.g. between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi or between the Golgi and the plasma membrane, depends on its own specific protein repertoire [6, 7] . This does not exclude that, as will be discussed below, certain elements such as the Bet3 and p115 proteins can be associated with more than one submodular (or even modular) function [8] . One concept to explain the occurrence of multifunctional proteins might be called \"protein parsimony\". In this view, there are simply not enough protein species (only 25,000 genes in humans) to serve all the different functions in a complicated eukaryotic cell under a variety of physiological states. Protein parsimony is especially important for replication of viruses, which is a race against time until the immune system of the host has acquired the ability to stop further spread and transmission of the virus. Thus, there is constant selection pressure for viruses to speed up their replication. One factor to achieve this goal are multifunctional proteins (and thus fewer genes), which allow faster amplification of the viral genome.",

Analogously, we define the inclusion of the viral genome into virus particles preassembled at membranes of infected cells as the input into the viral module and the release of the genome into the cytoplasm of an uninfected cell as the modular output. In spite of their quite different donor and acceptor compartments, the individual steps of vesicle transport and virus replication can be divided into clearly defined and functionally conserved submodules and follow basically the same series of events: 1. assembly of elements, 2. vesicle budding from the donor membrane, 3. uncoating or maturation, 4. tethering and docking of the vesicle or virus to the acceptor compartment and finally 5. membrane fusion and cargo release.

In the following, we will focus on small, enveloped viruses, mainly on influenza virus, but also mention other well-characterized pathogens such as the retrovirus human immunodeficiency virus (HIV; see glossary for a list of abbreviations) or model viruses such as the alphavirus Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV).

Both contain a membrane bilayer with a lipid composition identical (or very similar) to that of the membrane from which the vesicle or virus is derived. Transmembrane proteins are inserted into the bilayer and mediate attachment of the vesicle or virus to and fusion with the acceptor membrane. The bilayer is lined, either on the inside or on the outside, with coat proteins. Cellular vesicles involved in intra-Golgi transport contain a COP I coat, those that promote transport from the ER to the Golgi a COP II coat and for transport from the trans-Golginetwork to the endosome as well as for trafficking within the endocytic pathway a clathrin-coat is required. In the case of viruses the term \"coat\" comprises a variety of proteins, which might also have other functions. In the simple alphaviruses, such as SFV, the coat is an icosahedral capsid, which has also the function to encase the genome. In HIV, both functions are encoded by the gag-gene, whose product is proteolytically cleaved during virus budding to yield the coat and the capsid. Para-and orthomyxoviruses as well as VSV contain separate genes for the matrix protein, that builds the coat, and for the capsid protein. The large herpes viruses contain an amorphous structure beneath the envelope, called the tegument, which contains a multitude of proteins with a wide variety of functions. These coat proteins often drive the formation of the vesicle or virus by assembly and oligomerization at the budding site, and/or they define the shape of the particle. The interior of the particle contains the cargo, either cellular proteins or the viral genome encased in an icosahedral or helical capsid. Furthermore, cellular transport vesicles and enveloped viruses have almost the same size (50-100 nm and 40-300 nm, respectively), indicating that the curvature of their membranes is similar. A summary of the functional elements of the vesicle module and two representative viruses, influenza virus and HIV, is given in Table 1 .",

For that purpose both vesicles and viruses rely on interactions with the cytoskeleton. In Fig. 1 . Cellular coated vesicles and enveloped viruses: basic composition. Both vesicles and viruses contain a membrane bilayer (thin black circle) derived from the donor membrane, which is lined by a coat (red circle) assembled from soluble, monomeric subunits. Inserted into the bilayer are transmembrane proteins (blue) required for targeting of the vesicle or virus. The interior contains cargo (grey ellipse), either protein or the viral genome. Insets: EM-pictures of COP I vesicles (left, by courtesy of Christoph Rutz and Britta Br\u00fcgger, Biochemiezentrum, Heidelberg) and of influenza viruses (right, recreated 1918 influenza virus particles, taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Public Health Image Library, identification number #8160). Note that the scheme is a drastic simplification to compare analogue structures in viruses and vesicles. Especially the term \"coat\" often comprises a multitude of different proteins, which might also have additional functions. particular, directed polymerization of actin or the actin-myosin system facilitates transport underneath the plasma membrane and probably inside the nucleus. Transport from the cell's periphery to the nucleus (or more precisely to the perinuclear microtubuli organising center) and vice versa is achieved by the motor proteins dynein and kinesin, respectively, which move particles along microtubules. Viruses do not only misuse the cytoskeleton of the cell for their own purpose, but also hijack its vesicular transport system. During virus entry the endocytic pathway is used for virus transport towards the nucleus, whereas the exocytic pathway is utilized to deliver spike proteins to the plasma membrane or to secrete virus particles that bud into the lumen of exocytic organelles, such as the ER or the Golgi [9, 10] .",

The individual steps of vesicle transport and virus replication are shown to follow a similar sequence of submodular events, comprising assembly of elements, budding from the donor membrane, uncoating of vesicles or maturation of viruses, tethering and docking of the vesicle or virus to the acceptor compartment, membrane fusion, and cargo release and uncoating. Note that some viruses bud into the lumen of membranous organelles of the exocytic pathway (ER/Golgi) and are subsequently secreted by the cell. Likewise, some viruses enter the cell via the endocytic pathway and fuse with the membrane of early and late endosome or with vesicles that transport cargo between them. Maturation of viruses often occurs also inside the cell, e.g. in the exocytic pathway or after endocytic uptake. Furthermore, for herpes viruses the term \"maturation\" refers to the acquisition of tegument and envelope by the nucleocapsid, which originates from budding of capsid through the inner nuclear membrane and their subsequent fusion with the outer nuclear membrane. See text for details. perform their function usually only once, recycling (in the sense of re-use of an element after performing its function) does not occur. Even more, elements of the viral module are amplified after delivery of the cargo using the machinery of the freshly infected host cells.",

This ensures that a maximal number of virus particles are produced, at the expense of cellular integrity. Thus, the original notion of a module as a unit that performs a task in support of the major function of the system, i.e. in that case an infected tissue, organ or organism, does not apply for viruses. On the contrary, viruses subvert cellular (sub)modular processes for their purpose and their buildup as a functional module.",

Although small G-proteins play pivotal roles for almost every cellular module, structural proteins with nucleotidetriphosphate hydrolyzing activity (with the exception of RNA-or DNA-polymerases) are apparently absent from virus particles. As a consequence, input of energy into the functional cycle of a virus occurs only during synthesis of proteins, which must therefore be equipped with sufficient conformational energy to perform their various functions. Since most viral proteins or submodules (again with the exception of polymerases) perform their function only once, input of additional energy and thus the integration of GTPases into a viral module are not required.",

In vesicular transport, the hydrolyzing activity of small GTPases is used to uncoat the vesicle in the cytosol. In contrast, uncoating of viruses occurs after their entry into a freshly infected target cell. Assuming a similar function, i.e. uncoating, for a hypothetical viral GTPase, highenergy GTP would have to be integrated into virus particles. However, the labile phosphodiester bonds of GTP would be prone to hydrolyzation in the harsh environmental conditions that the virus particles can encounter during their passage from one organism to another. Hence, virus uncoatingwhich ought to occur only after entering the target cellwould be disturbed. To prevent this, viruses have adopted other strategies than \"own\" GTPases to uncoat their genome in freshly infected cells as will be described below.",

            "text": "To create a functional vesicle or virus several elements of the module must work together. Since transport is a vectorial process, the membrane from which the vesicle or virus is supposed to bud must be defined and cargo and components of the prospective vesicle must be specifically transported to the budding site. The assembly of the components often occurs via semistable submodular intermediates each with a specific function. Certain elements must check the input into the module, i.e. select the appropriate cargo and enrich it inside the vesicle or virus. Besides the cargo other elements must be incorporated into the particle and exposed on its surface to mediate recognition of and fusion with the correct target membrane. The budding process itself needs an element which physically drives the curvature of membranes to generate a bud. This is often achieved by assembly and polymerization of cytosolic coat proteins on the membrane. Other elements serve to select the site on the membrane where the coat proteins should polymerize. After formation of a bud the coat proteins (or other elements) must catalyze the fission of the vesicle/virus from the donor membrane. Finally, the activity of all elements must be orchestrated such that only functional vesicles, i.e. those that contain all required elements and the cargo, are released from the membrane [6, 11] . In the case of viruses, selection of their elements is less precise since the majority of released particles of many virus families are non-infectious, i.e. they lack at least one of the necessary components. This functional imperfection of virus budding is overcome by the sheer abundance of particles released by an infected cell (several thousands). For that purpose viruses can exploit the resources of the infected cell, whereas a similar wasteful strategy for vesicular transport would probably be detrimental for the cell's physiology. The elements which perform the described functions will now be discussed and compared for cellular transport vesicles and enveloped viruses.",

The matrix protein M1 participates in transport of vRNPs out of the nucleus, but also localizes peripherally to cellular membranes. Meanwhile, the glycoproteins HA and NA first form homooligomers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which are transported to the plasma membrane and enriched in specific membrane subdomains termed membrane rafts (Fig. 3 , right, see below). The cytoplasmic tails of HA and NA are believed to bind to M1 via weak interactions, which are amplified by oligomerization of M1 and which draw M1 to membrane rafts. As a consequence of these molecular interactions, cellular proteins are displaced causing the formation of the second submodular structure, namely, viral envelopes preassembled at the budding site. Finally, vRNPs bind to M1 causing assembly of the complete virus module and its budding from the membrane [14, 15] .",

In contrast, due to the large amount of capsid-like particles present in the cytoplasm of infected cells, one model for budding of SFV suggests that assembly of its capsid and integration of the viral genome occur inside the cell. However, since virus mutants defective in intracellular capsid formation can still form functional particles, it is possible that the capsid-like particles in the cytoplasm are dead end products and that, even for wild-type SFV, assembly of infectious viruses occurs at the plasma membrane [18, 19] . Some submodular structures are not only transient intracellular building blocks of virus particles, but stable functional units on their own. An example are cells infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), which secrete subviral lipoprotein particles, viral envelopes devoid of the capsid, at a 10,000fold higher concentration than virus particles, probably as decoys for the immune system [20] .",

After cotranslational myristoylation, the fatty acid is initially hidden inside a hydrophobic cleft of the monomeric protein. Gag then binds via electrostatic interactions to phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P 2 ), a specific component of the plasma membrane. Binding to the membrane facilitates multimerization of Gag and exposes myristate, which now inserts into the lipid bilayer (myristyl switch).

This anchors the G-protein to specific membranes and serves as a platform for assembly of the coat proteins [30] .

Molecular level: molecular interactions (left; red arrows) between the viral RNA, the three polymerase proteins (PA, PB1, PB2) and the structural protein NP build the viral ribonucleoproteinparticle (vRNP). The glycoprotein HA (right) forms trimers, which associate with rafts in the plasma membrane. The coat protein M1 associates with membranes, where it binds weakly to the cytoplasmic tail of HA; these molecular interactions are illustrated by green arrows. Submodular level: oligomerization of M1 strengthens the weak interactions with HA and draws M1 to the viral budzone, preassembled viral envelopes. This submodular entity contains also the second viral glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) and a few copies of the viral proton channel M2. Finally, the vRNPs bind to M1, a complete virus particle buds from the membrane and is released.

Furthermore, both viruses and vesicles must incorporate other elements into their membrane that facilitate targeting to and fusion with the target membrane. As already mentioned above, the input check of viruses tends to be less precise compared to vesicles since many released virus particles are non-infectious. Likewise, the formation of virus-like particles, containing a minimal number of proteins, but lacking the genome, is possible (see below).

For example, retroviral genomic RNA, which bears all hallmarks of cellular mRNA, constitutes much less than 1% of an infected cell's cytoplasmic RNA population. A component of the viral coat must therefore recognize unique features in the viral genome. In retroviruses these packaging signals are several hundred nucleotides long, sometimes discontinuous stretches of RNA, which are absent in spliced or subgenomic viral RNA molecules. The NC domain of the Gag-precursor binds to the packaging signal via a zinc-binding motif and adjacent basic amino acids. NC is inherently flexible, and it is therefore possible that different NC molecules bind to different regions of the packaging signal, which is too long to be bound by a single NC molecule. As retroviruses contain a diploid genome, specific base pairing between loop sequences of individual RNA molecules ensures packaging of dimers into virus particles, which is important for reverse transcription in a freshly infected cell [33] .",

A random packaging mechanism, in which any eight RNA segments were incorporated into virus particles, would yield a maximum of one infectious particle for every 400 (8!/ 8 8 ) assembled. As several thousands of virus particles are released by one infected cell, a random mechanism of packaging in principle would not preclude production of viruses capable of infecting other cells [33] . Nevertheless, recent cryo-electron microscopy (EM) tomography has shown that each virus particle contains exactly eight vRNPs, arranged as a specific pattern, seven in a circle surrounding one in the center. Each vRNP visible in the tomogram had a different length showing that eight different genes are present in a virus particle [34] . These argues in favour of a highly selective mechanism of genome packaging, but the individual packaging signals present in each vRNP still need to be identified.",

            "text": "Besides the genome, budding virus particles must also incorporate spike proteins to be infectious, but have to exclude most cellular membrane proteins. The viral proteins contribute only 1% (or less) of the surface proteins of the infected cell and yet the budded virus particles contain just a few, if any, cellular proteins. Initial budding models have proposed that very specific interactions between the cytoplasmic tails of viral transmembrane proteins and the viral coat ensure the integrity of virus particles [35] , but this has been proven so far only for budding of SFV as described below. Despite many efforts, binding sites for cytoplasmic tails of viral spike proteins have not been identified in coat proteins of other viruses, suggesting that they are of low affinity [36] . It is also noteworthy in this regard that during a mixed infection of a host cell with various unrelated viruses, so-called pseudotypes can appear. These are virus particles that contain the genome and the coat protein of one virus and the envelope proteins of another. The largest numbers of examples of pseudotyping were reported for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and other viruses containing a matrix protein [37] . Thus, viral coat proteins have the remarkable ability to discriminate between cellular and viral transmembrane proteins, although the latter do not possess sequence homology in the region which may possibly interact with the coat. A possible solution to this paradoxon would be a spatial separation of viral from cellular proteins within the membrane. Rafts could perform this function since many viral glycoproteins are present in detergentresistant-membranes, which are considered the biochemical correlate of membrane rafts [38] . However, this correlation does not seem to hold true in all cases [39] [40] [41] and other microdomains in the membrane, besides rafts, may be responsible. Upon expression at the plasma membrane, HA is neither randomly distributed, nor accumulates only in domains with the size of a raft. Instead HA molecules form irregular clusters on length scales from 40 nm up to many micrometers. Thus, HA (and possibly other viral glycopoteins) somehow accumulate in microdomains of the membrane or even induce their formation, which leads to their separation from most cellular proteins [22, [42] [43] [44] . Alternatively, binding of the matrix protein to the inner leaflet of the bilayer might modify the biophysical properties of the membrane such that microdomains are formed that are recognized mainly by viral glycoproteins.",

Transmembrane proteins supposed to be retrieved from the Golgi to the ER contain a cytoplasmic KKXX sequence that binds to a yet unknown component of the COP I coat. The majority of cargo proteins that travel along the exocytic pathway are concentrated in COP II vesicles prior to export from the ER. Transmembrane proteins possessing di-acidic, di-basic or short hydrophobic motifs in their tail bind to the sec24 subunit of the COP II coat. The diversity of signals explains the ability of COP II to package a wide variety of proteins. Endocytosis of surface receptors by clathrin-coated vesicles requires adaptor proteins connecting the receptor to the coat. The adaptors recognize sorting signals in the cytoplasmic tail of receptors, such as critical tyrosines, di-leucines or conjugated ubiquitin. If soluble components need to be transported, transmembrane cargo receptors, such as the KDEL-receptor for retrieval of lumenal proteins from the Golgi to the ER, are required, which must also be incorporated into the vesicle. Likewise, certain vesicular (v-) SNARE-proteins must be included to allow fusion of the vesicle only with the anticipated acceptor membrane. SNAREs involved in ER-to-Golgi transport bind to distinct sites of the Sec24 subunit of the COP II coat ensuring that vesicle budding and subsequent fusion are mechanistically integrated [6, 30] .",

As an example, two membrane proteins essential for budding at the inner nuclear membrane are absent from mature virus particles. Furthermore, capsids direct budding at the inner nuclear membrane, but do not trigger secondary envelopment.

Budding may also require cellular functions, which are recruited to the budding site by viral proteins. This mechanism was first found for the Gag protein of the retrovirus HIV-1, where a so-called \"late domain\" (L-domain), which affects late steps in virus budding, was identified. Viruses with a mutation in this domain assemble and bud, but remain linked to the infected cell by a thin bridge of continuous membrane bilayer, i.e. scission of virus particles does not occur. Viral late domains are also present in proteins of other viruses (but probably not in influenza viruses) and consist of short amino acid sequences, such as P(S/T)AP (Gag of HIV) or PPEY (M of filoviruses), which are partially interchangeable between viral proteins. Each L-domain binds to a different cellular protein of the family of \"class E VPS factors\" (VPS = vesicular protein sorting), which assemble to so-called ESCRT complexes (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport). In the cellular context ESCRT complexes are involved in sorting of proteins into vesicles that bud into the lumen of endosomes thereby forming multivesicular bodies (MVB). No detailed mechanistic understanding of the budding process is available yet, but ESCRT proteins must mediate similar functions as coat proteins, e.g. sorting of cargo proteins, induction of membrane curvature, and membrane fission. However, in contrast to coated vesicles, which bud into the cytosol, ESCRT-mediated budding occurs, like budding of viruses, out of the cytosol. Thus, many enveloped viruses have hijacked a cellular budding machinery (or parts thereof) for their own purpose making use of a well-established and fine-tuned cellular module. This interplay leads to the formation of new submodules using viral and cellular components that maintain modular regulation properties of the original cellular module, but lead to formation of the viral module [21, 47, 52] .",

In both cases addition of a small G-protein (Arf1 or Sar1) preloaded with GTP and the subunits of the coat (coatomer plus cytoplasmic tails of cargo receptors or sec24/24 and sec13/31) to liposomes leads to the formation and release of vesicles. Thus, assembly of cytosolic coat protein at membranes and their subsequent polymerization mediated by the small G-protein drives the budding reaction, further elements for scission of the vesicle are apparently not required [53, 54] . In contrast, release of clathrin-coated vesicles requires the large GTPase dynamin, which forms a ring around the neck of the budding vesicle, and GTP-hydrolysis provides the energy for scission [55] . Overall, the budding of coated vesicles bears the closest similarities to those viruses where assembly of cytosolic coat proteins on the surface of a membrane and their subsequent polymerization are the driving force for budding. This includes the retro-, rhabdo-, filoand paramyxoviruses. The second principle of virus budding (by polymerization of proteins within the membrane) is apparently also used by cells. Endocytosis of caveolae is probably executed by polymerisation of caveolin, a protein that has two cytoplasmic domains and inserts into membranes with a hairpin configuration. Binding of caveolin to cholesterol, a raft-lipid, is also required for endocytosis, emphasising that not only proteins, but also lipids are key players in budding of vesicles and viruses [56] .",

Both require the bringing together of many componentstransmembrane proteins, coat proteins and the cargoat specific sites of cellular membranes so that an ordered series of specific interactions leads to recognition and assembly. Often the components to be assembled are concentrated and segregated from the other cellular components so that the appropriate interactions become more likely. Most of the required interactions are probably rather weak since it must be easy to disassemble the module after it has fulfilled its function. Recognition of weak signals is enhanced by cooperativity, e.g. oligomerisation of coat proteins, and assembly of the components in a two-dimensional milieu, e.g. at a membrane or even at a specific microdomain of a membrane. This enhances the effect of the individual recognition steps so that a weak preference for interaction between two components becomes amplified by cooperation among many. Consequently, assembly in two dimensions must use a hierarchy of sorting steps and mechanisms for regulation and control that allow selection of the correct components and exclusion of incorrect ones.",

For instance, all enzymatic activities of the viral genome of influenza viruses are inhibited by assembly of vRNPs into a compact structure and their subsequent transport out of the nucleus. A key role in this process is played by the viral M1 protein. M1 is transported into the nucleus, where it binds to the vRNPs and mediates (in collaboration with the viral nonstructural protein NS2/NEP) their export through the nuclear pore to the budding site. The transcription activity of the vRNPs is not resumed before M1 is released from vRNPs in the low-pH environment of the target cell's endosome (see below). Thus, binding of M1 to vRNPs and subsequent release can be regarded as a molecular switch regulating the activity of the influenza virus genome [14, 57] .",

The saturated fatty acids may collect other saturated-chain lipids and cholesterol when HA is concentrated in the plasma membrane before budding. Since ordered lipid domains are especially prominent at ambient temperature they are thought to stabilize virus particles against environmental conditions, which is especially critical for viruses spread by airborne transmission [59] . Thus, unlike vesicles, which are processed after release from their donor compartment, the elements of a virus generally remain in an inactive, \"frozen\" state after virus release to protect the virus genome against harmful environmental conditions.

This can be achieved by virus-induced down-regulation of the virus receptor on the cell surface, by limiting the budding to a distinct part of the cell surface or by an enzymatic reaction. The latter is found in the case of influenza virus, where viral HA interacts with cellular surface glycoproteins containing sialic acid. This step is required for binding of viral particles to a cell to be infected, but disadvantageous when freshly assembled virus particles are to be released from an infected cell. The second viral glycoprotein NA cleaves sialic acid from every cellular glycoprotein and glycolipid it encounters during its transit through the exocytic pathway to the plasma membrane and thus destroys the cellular receptor on the infected cell. Likewise, NA cleaves sialic acid also from viral HA to avoid aggregation of virus particles and loss of infectivity [60] .",

The coat protein of HIV is synthesized largely as a Gag-precursor containing the matrix protein (MA), the capsid protein (CA), the nucleocapsid protein (NC) and the p6 protein (containing the recognition motif for elements of the cellular ESCRT-complex, see above) as one large polypeptide chain. Smaller amounts (5%) of a Gag-Pol fusion protein containing also a protease (PR) and the polymerase are also made. After its synthesis the polyprotein binds to the plasma membrane and polymerizes, which initiates budding of virus particles as described above. The low autoproteolytic activity of the Gag-precursor cleaves the polyprotein into the mentioned subunits. This releases free protease, which is more potent and rapidly attacks further Gag-precursors causing the release of more protease. Thus, a positive feedback mechanism exists until every polyprotein is cleaved. Upon cleavage, the spherical Gag shell typical of the immature particle undergoes structural rearrangement to form a morphologically distinct mature particle, which can even be recognized in EM-pictures. Whereas immature particles have a disorganised central core, the matrix protein lines the inner side of the envelope in mature virus particles, and the capsid protein forms a cone-shaped core containing the genome complexed to the nucleocapsid protein and the polymerase. Proteolytic cleavage of the Gagprecursor is not required for budding, but prepares the virus for the subsequent uncoating of its genetic material in a freshly infected cell. This process must be regulated such that the initial proteolytic attack does not occur in the cytoplasm, but only during or shortly after the budding of the virus particle [26, 61] .",

Proteolytic cleavage is an essential step of virus maturation since it primes the fusion protein for subsequent activation at the cell the virus is about to infect. Proteins with a polybasic stretch of amino acids at the cleavage site are proteolyzed inside every cell by a ubiquitous protease of the furin-family present in the TGN. Fusion proteins with a monobasic cleavage site are not recognized by this protease; therefore, they have to be cleaved by an extracellular protease, which usually takes place in the organism to be infected [62] . The fusion proteins of other viruses (e.g. SARS corona virus, Ebola) are cleaved after uptake into the endosome by proteases of the cathepsin family [63, 64] .",

Small G-proteins present in the vesicle, Arf or Sar, hydrolyze GTP, which causes retraction of their hydrophobic N-termini from the membrane and detachment of the G-proteins from the vesicle membrane. This destablilizes the coat, which is disassembled, and its constituents are released into the cytosol, where they serve as a pool for the formation of new vesicles (recycling).

These events must be temporally coordinated for successful infection of cells: for instance, the infectivity of the virus would be irreversibly destroyed if the fusion activity were triggered prior to virus binding to the target cell. Thus, recognition of the cellular receptor by the viral glycoprotein is a modular switch that activates the further processing events of the module, which are schematically depicted in Fig. 4 .",

            "text": "The presence of a suitable receptor on the cell surface is recognized by a viral glycoprotein and is one of the factors that determine the type of cell a certain virus can infect. Some receptors are present on many cell types, such as glycoproteins and glycolipids containing terminal N-acetyl neuraminic acid (sialic acid) recognized by influenza virus HA (see Fig. 4 , green box, for the molecular details of this interaction). However, avian and human viruses have a different preference for the type of linkage that attaches the sialic acid moiety to the penultimate sugar of the carbohydate chain, galactose. Human viruses preferentially recognize an \u03b12,6 linkage, whereas avian viruses require an \u03b12,3 bond. Since the matching receptors are distributed correspondingly in human and avian epithelial cells, the type of receptor represents a species barrier an avian virus, e.g. the H5N1 virus, has to overcome to become a human pathogen [65, 66] . Other viruses recognize even more specific receptors on the target cell, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor present on motoneurons, which is used by the G-protein of rabies virus, or CD4 present on T-helper cells, which is recognized by gp160 of HIV. Successful infection of T-helper cells by HIV requires a second component, a member of the chemokine receptor family. Thus, HIV uses a \"two step mode\" of cell binding; other viruses, e.g. herpes viruses, also require two types of receptors to which they bind with low and high affinity, respectively. This two step mode of binding thus resembles reversible tethering and irreversible docking of cellular vesicles. Binding to the first receptor allows viruses to sample whether the second, highaffinity receptor is presentif no receptor is found virus particles are discharged. Release of unproductively bound viruses may also be exerted by a receptor-destroying activity present in one of the viral glycoproteins. An example is the neuraminidase of influenza and paramyxoviruses, which removes virus particles from their receptor if subsequent steps of virus entry do not follow. This is especially important during virus invasion into an organism since virus particles have to make their way through the sialic acid containing mucus present in the airways until they encounter a susceptible cell. Thus, the input signal for the switch that activates the virus might be turned off if subsequent steps of virus entry do not occur [67, 68] . Cellular transport vesicles also use a two step binding mode to attach to their acceptor compartment. Each membranous compartment is equipped with specific tethering complexes, either large multisubunit particles, such as TRAPP or the exocyst, or long putative coiled-coil proteins, such as p115. Tethering complexes interact with appropriate transport vesicles, where they activate a member of the family of rab-proteins, small GTPases of the ras-superfamily. Activated rab then interacts with its downstream effectors, which triggers a cascade of events that prime the subsequently acting SNARE-proteins to fulfil their function, docking and fusion [69, 70] .",

Thus, tethers, rabs and SNAREs collaborate in a sequential series of events to ensure that cellular membranes fuse at the correct time and place. However, it does not universally hold true that each module or submodule has its unique protein inventory. For example, the TRAPP subunit Bet3, which we know to be associated to the submodular function of vesicle tethering, is also found to interact with subunits of the COP II vesicle coat. Since the coat is removed from the vesicle before tethering, this means that Bet3 must be associated to more than one submodular function [8] .",

Some viruses, such as retroviruses and paramyxoviruses, fuse directly with the plasma membrane of the cell, and this activity is triggered by binding to a cellular receptor. The viral fusion protein might be identical with (retroviruses) or different from (paramyxoviruses) the receptor-binding protein. In the latter case a signal generated by binding to the cellular receptor must be transmitted to the fusion protein. Other viruses, such as influenza, are taken up by endocytic vesicles, which they use as a ferry for their transport from the periphery of the cell to a perinuclear location. However, since endosomes ultimately fuse with lysosomes, the virus has to leave the compartment early enough to avoid degradation by hydrolytic enzymes. The increasingly acidic pH generated by a membrane proton pump V-ATPase in the endosome triggers a conformational change in HA that executes fusion of viral and endosomal membranes thereby allowing access of vRNPs to the cytoplasm [67, 68, 71, 72] . Enveloped viruses often exhibit flexibility in cell entry, being able to use different pathways. Influenza viruses uses both clathrin-dependent and -independent endocytosis for uptake and HIV, which can fuse with the plasma membrane, can also utilize endocytotic vesicles for cell entry [73, 74] .",

A second conformational change then bends HA (c), which leads to hemifusion with exchange of lipids (d) and opening of a fusion pore (e). For clarity, the receptor-binding HA 1 subunit (grey) is omitted in b to e. Picture modified from Ref. [85] . and after membrane fusion, has led to a model on how conformational changes of HA execute membrane fusion. An internal hydrophobic segment (fusion peptide) at the N-terminus of the subunit HA 2 , which is buried inside the trimeric structure at neutral pH, becomes exposed on the molecule's surface after acidification. It is thought to insert into the cellular membrane allowing the molecule to exert force on the bilayer. A second conformational change then bends HA thereby drawing the fusion peptide towards the transmembrane region. The second conformational change requires two so-called \"heptad repeats\", amphipathic helices in the vicinity of the fusion peptide and the transmembrane region, which interact to form a stable coiledcoil domain. The two conformational changes resemble the opening and subsequent closing of one blade of a pocket knife. This leads to a close apposition of viral and endosomal membranes, hemifusion with exchange of lipids, opening of a fusion pore and eventually complete merger of both lipid bilayers [65] . (See Fig. 4 , red box, for detailed series of events.) Many other viral fusion proteins, e.g. the F-protein of paramyxoviruses and gp160 of HIV, have a similar helical coiled-coil structure as influenza virus HA after fusion suggesting that they cause membrane fusion by a similar mechanism. Other viral fusion proteins do not exhibit a helical coiled-coil structure after fusion, but the basic principle of their fusion mechanism is the same: exposure of a fusion peptide that is hidden in the unactivated state, its insertion into the cellular membrane and a second conformational change, which pulls on and finally fuses the membranes [75] . Membrane fusion is not an achievement of fusion proteins alone, since specific lipids must be present at the fusion site to allow negative and positive curvature of the bilayer required at the different steps of membrane merger [76] .",

Thus, a control mechanism, i.e. a switch must exist to shift the equilibrium of metastable interactions to assembly in the cell the virus is about to leave and to disassembly in a newly infected cell. During influenza virus infection this is achieved by chemically different environments upon assembly and disassembly. Assembly of influenza virus occurs at the neutral pH of the cytoplasm, whereas disassembly is accomplished through the low pH which the virus encounters in the endosome. The protons in the endosome trigger an irreversible conformational change in the hemagglutinin, which thereby gets activated to catalyze fusion of viral and endosomal membranes (see above). At the same time the interior of virus particles is acidified through the proton-channel activity of the third viral envelope protein, M2 [78] . The protons induce the dissociation of M1 from vRNPs, which are then released through the fusion pore into the cytosol [57] . Thus, upon infection, the fragmentation of the viral module into submodules and single components is achieved via spatial sequestration and chemical specificity (see Fig. 4 ).",

The switch from mRNA to vRNA synthesis is regulated by the number of NP-molecules, which bind to elongating RNA-strands thereby allowing the polymerase to make a vRNA copy. Thus, in the absence of NP, as it occurs when the viral genome has just entered the cell, mRNAs (and subsequently viral proteins) are made, whereas later in infection, when NP (and other viral proteins) are abundant, a switch to genome replication occurs. The submodular activity of transcription and replication is finally switched off by export of vRNPs from the nucleus, which is regulated by binding to M1 and which requires also the nonstructural protein NS2/NEP [13] .",

A step in this direction is the drug Fuzeon \u00ae , which was licensed in 2003 as a new class of antiretroviral drugs for HIV therapy. Fuzeon, a peptide that corresponds in its sequence to one of the mentioned heptad repeats of the fusion protein gp41, prevents the second conformational change of the glycoprotein, which executes membrane fusion. The efficiency of such drugs can even be increased by linking them to cholesterol, which targets the molecule to raft domains where HIV fusion occurs [80] . However, the application of Fuzeon has led to the appearance of resistant virus strains, since the binding site of the peptide in the other heptad repeat region can change without affecting the fusion activity of the protein [81] .",

Interesting in this respect is a study describing a peptide that binds to the capsiddomain of gag of HIV thereby inhibiting assembly of immature and mature capsids in the test tube [24, 82] . Such drugs might be even better if they block the interaction surface between two different components of a virus particle, for example between different proteins of a viral coat or between spike proteins and coat proteins. The use of such therapeuticals might be less prone to the formation of resistant virus strains, since this would require several mutations on different submodules or molecular components, which must simultaneously occur to confer drug resistance.

Viruses do make use of cellular modules, such as signal transduction cascades (activated by binding of viruses to a receptor on the cell surface), ribosomes for protein synthesis and vesicles for transport of newly synthesized glycoproteins to the viral assembly site. Inhibition of such non-redundant cellular modules would block replication of a virus, but would obviously also disturb vital functions of the cell. An exception might be the various vesicular transport pathways, such as phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, clathrin-, caveolae or raft-mediated endocytosis, which a cell uses to internalize extracellular compounds [67, 68] . Most, if not all, viruses hijack one of these pathways to gain entry into the host cell. The exact composition of the endocytic modules and submodules is currently an emerging area of research. Protein kinases, which selectively control one of several different entry pathways, have been identified as promising drug targets. The strategy is based on the assumption that cells are robust enough to allow temporal inactivation of one of their endocytic pathways, whereas simple viruses are not prepared to use backup strategies if their obligatory entry pathway is blocked. Furthermore, since genetically unrelated viruses might use the same entry pathway, it is even imaginable that broad-spectrum antivirals might be developed [83] . Thus, the search for such drugs might be very promising, but requires a better understanding of the modular features of the viral life cycle and the fine-tuned interplay between viral and cellular function.",

The similarity does not arise from the same or similar elements which are usedthere is not even a high degree of sequence homology between any of the analogous elements that constitute the vesicular and viral modules. The similarity rather arises from the basic composition and functionality of the underlying structures and their dynamics. For example, it is a decisive property of biological membranes, indispensable to life, that they allow the selective and controlled passage of cargo. To transit the membranes that sequester intracellular compartments from one another, life has invented proteins to induce membrane bending, using the fluidity of the lipid bilayer. The virus mimics this ability by employing virus fusion proteins (which replace the vesicular SNAREs). The \"fraud\" which viruses commit is not on the level of the same or similar molecular inventory but on the level of submodular function. We have seen that this extends to the essential properties and hallmarks of cellular modules: Functional input-output cycles, spatial sequestration of elements, amplification of signals and negative feedback occur also during the replicative cycle of an enveloped virus. The occurrence of the same schemes in two entirely different domains of life may imply that these submodular functions are indeed a critical level of biological organisation [1] , reflecting general biochemical and biophysical design principles.",

            "text": "Fig. 2. Functional input/output cycles. The figure illustrates the notion of enveloped viruses as \"vesicular carriers of the viral genome\". The input into both vesicular and viral transport modules is the uptake of cargo, either protein or the viral genome, from a donor compartment, the output is the release of cargo into another membrane-encased acceptor compartment. The individual steps of vesicle transport and virus replication are shown to follow a similar sequence of submodular events, comprising assembly of elements, budding from the donor membrane, uncoating of vesicles or maturation of viruses, tethering and docking of the vesicle or virus to the acceptor compartment, membrane fusion, and cargo release and uncoating. Note that some viruses bud into the lumen of membranous organelles of the exocytic pathway (ER/Golgi) and are subsequently secreted by the cell. Likewise, some viruses enter the cell via the endocytic pathway and fuse with the membrane of early and late endosome or with vesicles that transport cargo between them. Maturation of viruses often occurs also inside the cell, e.g. in the exocytic pathway or after endocytic uptake. Furthermore, for herpes viruses the term \"maturation\" refers to the acquisition of tegument and envelope by the nucleocapsid, which originates from budding of capsid through the inner nuclear membrane and their subsequent fusion with the outer nuclear membrane.

Molecular level: molecular interactions (left; red arrows) between the viral RNA, the three polymerase proteins (PA, PB1, PB2) and the structural protein NP build the viral ribonucleoproteinparticle (vRNP). The glycoprotein HA (right) forms trimers, which associate with rafts in the plasma membrane. The coat protein M1 associates with membranes, where it binds weakly to the cytoplasmic tail of HA; these molecular interactions are illustrated by green arrows. Submodular level: oligomerization of M1 strengthens the weak interactions with HA and draws M1 to the viral budzone, preassembled viral envelopes. This submodular entity contains also the second viral glycoprotein neuraminidase (NA) and a few copies of the viral proton channel M2. Finally, the vRNPs bind to M1, a complete virus particle buds from the membrane and is released. The hallmarks of functional modules (grey lettering) are described in the text, Sections 3.1 and 3.2.",
