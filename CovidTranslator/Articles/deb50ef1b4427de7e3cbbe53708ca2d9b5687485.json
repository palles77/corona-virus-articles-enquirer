After 3 years of age, rhinovirus (RV) accounts for 75 to 80% of the virus-induced attacks leading to hospitalizations and emergency room (ER) visits, and the majority of these children are atopic (1, 5) . Evidence to date also indicates that an RV infection together with sensitization and exposure to inhaled allergens increases the risk for acute symptoms, suggesting that these risk factors may act synergistically to provoke asthma exacerbations (1, 5, 6) . Whether these observations can be generalized to children living in countries with tropical climates is not clear. In studies from Brazil and Trinidad the prevalence of infections with RV among children treated for asthma was less than half of what has been reported in countries with temperate climates (7, 8) . Recognizing that additional studies are needed from tropical environments to gain a better understanding for role of viral infections in the etiology of asthma exacerbations worldwide, the purpose of this investigation was to examine the prevalence of viral respiratory tract infections among children treated for acute wheezing in Costa Rica and to evaluate the results in relation to their atopic status.",

Similar to other countries near the equator, Costa Rica has two seasons: a \"dry\" season (generally December through April) and a \"rainy\" season (May through November). Exposure to helminthes, which, like environmental allergens, can stimulate the production of IgE, is common in economically-deprived regions of Hispanic America. However, antihelminth medications are given annually to children in Costa Rica starting at one year of age. Thus, active parasite and enteric infections during childhood are not frequent in that country (e.g., \u2264 2% for infections with A. lumbricoides) (9, 10) .",

At present, however, there is little information about the relevance of viral infections to acute attacks of asthma in this country. Additionally, recent evidence from countries with temperate climates suggest that Group C strains of RV may be strongly related to asthma exacerbation compared to other strains (14) (15) (16) . This information is also lacking in studies of asthma in tropical countries. Thus, our objective was to investigate the relationship between respiratory viruses, including different strains of RV, and episodes of asthma requiring acute treatment. Aditionally, we took advantage of the dominance of dust mite sensitization in Costa Rica to investigate the relationship of titers of IgE antibodies to exacerbations of asthma with or without evidence of a recent viral infection.",

Data from the non-asthmatic controls in the present investigation, as well as from younger children evaluated for respiratory infections in other studies, suggest that the frequency of infections with Group A and C strains may be similar (16, 21) . This suggests that the airway in patients with asthma may be more susceptible to infections with Group C strains. At present, the receptor used by Group C viruses to infect epithelial cells is not known. The cell surface receptor used by Group A strains is the adhesion molecule, ICAM-1 (23, 24) . Previous studies, including our own, indicate that the expression of ICAM-1 (both soluble and membrane ICAM-1) is reduced in the asthmatic airway (25, 26) , which might give Group C viruses a selective advantage for infecting the asthmatic respiratory tract epithelium. In our patient population, FE NO and specific IgE levels were similar among children infected with Group C and Group A strains. Additionally, the risk for wheezing with RV among children with high titers of IgE antibodies to dust mite allergen was not significantly increased among those infected with Group C strains. Recently, the significance of allergy in the response to RV was also suggested by the significant decrease in asthma exacerbations among children treated with omalizumab (27) . The beneficial effects of inhaled corticosteroids, which also reduce Th2 inflammation and prevent asthma exacerbations during childhood, also support this observation (28, 29) .",

These results are consistent with results from our experimental challenges with RV-16 demonstrating that the levels of FE NO were significantly increased before the virus inoculation among asthmatics with high levels of total IgE (25) . Together, the results suggest that pre-existing allergic inflammation is the main risk factor for an asthmatic response to RV. In the present study, the positive correlation between titers of IgE to Dp, Df, or Bt and FE NO levels provides further evidence for the relevance of dust mite allergen to the pathogenesis of airway inflammation.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this investigation highlights the significant risk for asthma attacks caused by RV among children with high titers of IgE antibodies, which was most often associated with sensitization to dust mite allergen in Costa Rica. Thus far, anti-viral treatments, including vaccines, to treat infections with RV have been difficult to develop, because of antigenic diversity among RV strains. The predisposition of asthmatics to become infected with Group C strains might offer a more targeted approach for developing anti-viral treatments. However, this approach would not be effective for the 40% of wheezing children who did not test positive for RV in this study, and may not be effective in preventing attacks of asthma caused by Group A strains. Alternatively, treatments focused on decreasing allergic airway inflammation could provide a broader approach to prevent and/or decrease the severity of asthma exacerbations caused by RV. Thus, results from this study provide strong evidence that characterizing the atopic status of asthmatic children in greater detail, including their titers of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, is needed both to enhance investigations focused on mechanisms of RV-induced attacks of asthma and to identify children who are most likely to benefit from allergen-specific therapies.",
