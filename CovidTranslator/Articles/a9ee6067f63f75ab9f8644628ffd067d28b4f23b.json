Subsequently, virus isolation was preformed with PCR-positive samples, and then PCR product of 5 0 -untranslated region (UTR) of BVDV isolate was sequenced and analyzed. Among the samples collected, 20 (from 17 bovine abortuses, one intestine, and two diarrheal stools) were positive for BVDV RT-PCR; four BVDVs (from two bovine abortuses, one intestine, and one diarrheal stool) were isolated. When the four isolates were biotyped in cell culture, one BVDV isolate from a bovine abortus was cytopathic and the others were non-cytopathic. In addition, three isolates were genotyped as BVDV-1 and one isolate from a diarrheal stool as BVDV-2. In phylogenetic analysis, it suggested that the BVDV-2 isolate in Korea is closer to the North American strains than Asian strains. This is the first report on the identification and isolation of BVDV-2 in Korea.",

Clinically severe disease outbreaks associated with acute, uncomplicated BVDV infection have been reported in the US, Britain, Canada, and Germany (Carman et al., 1998) . BVDV infection causes various clinical symptoms such as diarrhea, respiratory disorders, and immunosuppression . Meanwhile, infection with a highly virulent virus, BVDV-2 could result in prolonged fever, leukopenia, severe thrombocytopenia, and diarrhea (Bolin and Ridpath, 1992; Corapi et al., 1989) . In particular, transplacental infection of BVDV in pregnant cows results in reproductive failure such as abortion, mummification or congenital defects according to the gestation stage (Nagai et al., 2001) . During the first trimester of gestation the virus infection may produce persistently infected (PI) calves, which are immunotolerant to the infected virus. Thereafter, PI calves maintain significantly a large reservoir, shedding large quantities of the virus in their lifetime, in addition to being a risk group for the mucosal disease (Nettleton and Entrican, 1995; Thiel et al., 1996) .",

            "text": "Together with classical swine fever virus (CSFV) and border disease virus (BDV), BVDV belongs to the genus Pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae. The virus genome consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (approximately 12.5 kb in length), which has one large open Research in Veterinary Science 76 (2004) [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] www.elsevier.com/locate/rvsc reading frame (ORF) coding about 4,000 amino acids (Collett et al., 1988; De Moerlooze et al., 1993; Deng and Brock, 1992) and its polyprotein is proteolytically processed during virus replication to generate viral structural and non-structural proteins (Meyers and Thiel, 1996) . Further, the genome contains untranslated regions (UTRs) at both ends (5 0 and 3 0 UTRs). Pestivirus 5 0 -UTR includes several short ORFs of unknown function and has been predicted to form a highly structured RNA element that may serve as an internal ribosome entry site to initiate cap-independent translation of ORFs (Brown et al., 1992) . The 5 0 -UTR is particularly attractive for the purpose of viral differentiation because it is highly conserved among members within each pestivirus species (Boye et al., 1991; Berry et al., 1992) . On the basis of the 5 0 -UTRs analysis, BVDV was segregated into two genotypes, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2. Sequence homology within each group was over 93%, while between groups 1 and 2 dropped to 74% (Ridpath et al., 1994) . Moreover, BVDV-1 was subdivided into BVDV-1a including reference strain NADL, and BVDV-1b including reference strain Osloss (Pellerin et al., 1994; van Rijn et al., 1997) . In general, BVDV was also subdivided into cytopathic BVDV (cpBVDV) and noncytopathic BVDV (ncpBVDV) biotypes based on cell culture results.",

In particular, the major economic damage caused by BVDV in susceptible animals is primarily the result of intrauterine infection (Doherty, 1986) . Pathological studies of the virus predominantly focused on the establishment of persistent infections and the development of mucosal disease. Originally identified in outbreaks of severe disease, BVDV-2 was initially thought to be a new and invariably virulent virus. Subsequent studies demonstrated that the virus of genotype 2 has been circulating among the North American cattle population for at least 20 years (Carman et al., 1998) . Genotype 2 has been identified in Europe (Wolfmeyer et al., 1997) , South America (Canal et al., 1998) and North America (Evermann and Ridpath, 2002) , indicating that it is likely to be identified in other countries as well as the epidemiological investigation proceeds (Canal et al., 1998; Evermann and Ridpath, 2002) . Characterization of BVDV genotype has revealed distinction in the 5 0 non-coding region of pestivirus RNA (Harasawa, 1994; Harasawa and Sasaki, 1995) . In this study, primers for BVDV detection were designed on 5 0 -UTR to determine two BVDV genotypes. The sensitivity of the established RT-PCR was reasonable to detect BVDV from clinical samples. In addition, the specificity of PCR was distinct from other bovine viruses. Because CSFV does not infect cattle and BDV is not present in Korea, these viruses were excluded in the test. Most of the collected samples were aborted fetuses derived from bovine reproductive studies, and the ratio of abortion related to BVDV infection was approximately 6.8%. This result was similar to that of a recent report in Korea (Lee et al., 1999) , in which a major cause of 73 abortions or stillbirths determined by pathological findings was neosporosis (21%). The report suggested that BVDV only or co-infection of other viruses and bacteria was 8%. For genotyping the isolates, BVDV-2 specific primer set was designed on the N pro region, with which was appropriate for differential RT-PCR. This study clarified that two genotypes, BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, are present in the Korean cattle population. It was also reported that a Korean isolate of BVDV-2 was a non-cytopathogenic virus. Sequencing efforts were restricted to the four viruses that were able to grow in culture. But, it would have been better to include all 20 positives in this analysis. This would also have helped in determining the relative abundance of type 1 versus type 2 viruses, although this study showed for the first time the existence of type 2 viruses in Korea. It would not be able to discriminate as to whether or not animals are infected with the two types of virus simultaneously. Through direct fluorescent assay, the possibility to be a bovine parvovirus, bovine coronavirus, bovine rotavirus, and bovine adenovirus was excluded.",

Further homology analysis through the BLAST search revealed that BVDV, Bo388 strain had 97% and 95% homologies with BVDV, 5521-95 strain (Accession No.: AF039174) and BVDV, KZ-91-CP isolate (Accession No.: AB003619) that were known to be a BVDV-2. These results indicate that BVDV, Bo388 strain is more similar to BVDV, 5521-95 strain than BVDV, 890 strain. Thus, it was suggested that BVDV, Bo388 isolate may be a variant of BVDV-2. This is the first report on the isolation and identification of BVDV-2 in Korea.",

It was difficult to compare with other strains from various geographical origins, because the first isolation of Korean BVDV-1 was reported in 1987, becoming endemic in the Korean bovine herds (Seok, 1987) . BVDV-1 had been existed in Korea for more than 20 years, it may be suggested that Korean isolates (Bo 41, Bo 333, Bo 373) could make a domestic own cluster. In BVDV-2, the first Korean isolate was grouped into a different cluster with reference BVDV-2 strains, 890 and NewYork \u00d593 strains. The Korean isolate was closer American strains than Japanese strains. This was supported by 77% of bootstrap replicates.",
