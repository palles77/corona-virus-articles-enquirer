Bacterial pathogens such as enteropathogenic E. coli and Salmonella sp. play an important role as a cause of primary and secondary enteric infections. However, in the last decade since Mebus discovered rotaviruses as a cause of diarrhea in neonatal calves, numerous previously unrecognized viruses have been found in diarrheic feces of a variety of animals and man. Part of the reason for this upsurge was the fact that virologists started using the electron microscope as a diagnostic tool, looking for viruses directly in negatively stained fecal preparations as an adjunct to the routine procedure of inoculating tissue cultures. Many of the viruses such as corona-, rota-, parvoand adenoviruses are difficult to isolate from clinical specimens and propagate in cell cultures with present techniques. The presence of mixed enteric viral infections, which are not as uncommon as the literature might suggest, would remain undetected in most cases without the employment of the electron microscope.",

In a large farrowing house, piglets were born normally and were healthy for the first week of life. ~ At 1-2 weeks of age the piglets stopped nursing and rapidly became unthrifty with some vomiting. Morbidity was high (approx. 80~) while the mortality was low (approx. 10~). Older pigs and sows did not show any clinical signs except for excessive nasal discharge. The 4 piglets submitted were leukopenic (2000-6000 white blood cells/ml) and rectal temperatures averaged 41\u00b0C. Encapsulated E. coli and the following viruses were found in the intestines of the 4 piglets: adenovirus, parvovirus (possibly adenoassociated virus), picornavirus and rotavirus. The microscopic lesions pointed to an involvement of any or all of these viruses in the pathogenesis of this syndrome. Lymphocytic cuffs were noted around small veins in the hippocampus of one piglet and in the muscularis of the stomach of all 4 piglets. Also, some ganglia in the gastric wall of all 4 animals were infiltrated with lymphocytes. All of these viruses would have been missed had routine tissue culture isolation procedures been used because some of the viruses (picornavirus, adenovirus and parvovirus) were found to be coated with antibodies and rotaviruses simply do not replicate well in tissue cultures.",

Subsequently, adenoviruses also were isolated from lambs with respiratory illness [16] . Respiratory as well as enteric signs were induced in experimentally inoculated colostrum-deprived lambs [16, 17] . The first adenoviruses in lambs in the U.S.A. were encountered in the following field case submitted to TVMDL: one thousand and fifty 6-8-month-old lambs were purchased through a sale and vaccinated against Clostridium perfringens type D at that time. One week later a few lambs were anoretic and had a watery diarrhea. They were found dead 2 5 days later. Ultimately 90 lambs became ill and all affected lambs died despite specific antibiotic treatments against Salmonella sp. which was isolated from the intestine. Adenoviruses as well as parvoviruses (possibly adeno-associated viruses) were demonstrated in the intestinal contents (Fig. 2) . It is interesting that all affected lambs apparently originated from the same farm. Since latency in adenovirus infections is not uncommon, it is conceivable that these 90 lambs already harbored adenoviruses when they entered the sale at which time they may also have become infected with Salmonella sp. The dual infection was lethal to the lambs while the salmonella infections alone might have been controlled with antibiotics as determined by antibiotic sensitivity tests. Of course, the reverse is also possible, i.e. lambs were latently infected with salmonella upon entry into the sale where they became exposed to adenoviruses.",

Occasionally the center may become stained giving a doughnutshaped appearance. The length of the peplomers is 20 nm with variations ranging from 16 to 24 nm. The shape of the peplomers may differ and have been variously described as petals, clubs or teardrops. The peplomere is, however, always larger in diameter at the distal end than at the site of attachment to the virion (Fig. 3) . This characteristic as well as the length of the peplomers differentiates coronaviruses from orthomyxovirus. Certain cell artifacts such as parts of nuclear or cytoplasmic membranes or parts of organelles may be confused with coronaviruses.

Storz and co-workers [40] found a high percentage of animal sera including commercial batches of fetal bovine sera to contain parvovirus hemagglutination inhibition antibodies. These sera, if used in cell cultures, could certainly inhibit parvovirus replication. Parvoviruses are also frequently aggregated in vivo (Fig, 6) . Isolation of parvoviruses at TVMDL was only possible in cases where the majority of the parvovirus particles were observed to be unaggregated on electron microscopic examination. Morphological identification of parvoviruses is generally not difficult since these viruses are present in high numbers and are of uniform size and shape. Frequently one can also find a few empty capsids with a vague hexagonal outline (Fig. 7) .",

Feces from a foal with diarrhea contained only the smaller, single-capsid layer particles [52] .

Laboratory tests indicated that these signs were due to ostertagiaisis. The few virus-like particles observed in the feces all had 4 centrally-located capsomeres of 10-nm diameter with 'empty' capsomeres outlining the surface. In comparing these particles morphologically with known virus families one could speculate that on the basis of the size and shape of the capsomeres, they may represent partially denatured herpesviruses.",

The ubiquitous nature of many of these viral agents makes prevention difficult since vaccines are not available. However, since at least some of the viruses exist in the form of subclinical infections in a delicate balance with the host, factors shifting this balance in favor of the parasite should be controlled. Maintaining the animal in a healthy state, avoiding overcrowding and minimizing exposure are preventative factors to be considered. Adenoviruses may cause severe enteric signs in isolated cases in man as well as in animals under certain circumstances. Pathogenicity of individual strains, genetic susceptibility of animals, concurrent infection with other pathogens as well as other factors need to be further elucidated. As the field cases reported herein illustrate, adenovirus infections are probably most prevalent in places with high animal densities such as ovine or bovine feedlots. In comparison, adenovirus infections in man also represent the most serious problem among military recruits during 'boot camp'.",

While some case reports implicate coronavirus in man and dogs as a cause of diarrhea, other studies do not associate these viruses with any specific disease state. The role of these viruses in enteric infections of man and dog must await experimental and pathogenetic studies. The pleomorphism of coronaviruses makes these viruses difficult to identify on a strictly morphological basis, and some of the electronmicrographs in the literature cast some doubt as to whether they are indeed coronaviruses.",
