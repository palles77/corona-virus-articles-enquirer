A detailed modelling study of disease transmission in the state of Georgia, USA, found that in extreme scenarios when 25% of the population participated in a 2day long gathering shortly before the epidemic peak, peak prevalence could increase by up to 10% [8] . More realistic scenarios resulted in minimal population-level changes [8] .",

Contacts were defined as those with whom participants had a face-to-face conversation within 3 metres and/or physically touched skin-on-skin. Participants were able report individual contacts and up to five groups of contacts, for instance church groups, weddings, large work functions or multiple contacts at work. The 'groups' question was designed to aid participants in reporting multiple similar contacts. Group contacts were defined in the same way as individual contacts, i.e. if a person attended a concert with 1,000 people, but only spoke to 5 people, the number of recorded group contacts would be 5. Participants were asked whether members of the group knew each other.",

The SCS specifically asked about groups of similar contacts. These groups are not necessarily public or mass gatherings, and represented groups that both knew each other and those that did not. The SCS asked about contacts on a single day, therefore did not capture multi-day events; simulation studies have shown that prolonged mass gatherings were necessary to alter the course of an epidemic [8] . Our analysis was based on social contact data collected between 2009 and 2010; contact patterns may have altered in the past decade. We also did not account for individuals changing their behaviour if group activities were cancelled.",
