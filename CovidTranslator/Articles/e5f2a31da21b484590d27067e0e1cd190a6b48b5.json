Affected communities look for known symptoms, prevention measures, and treatment strategies. On the other hand, health organizations try to get situational updates to assess the severity of the outbreak, known affected cases, and other details. Recent emergence of social media platforms such as Twitter provide convenient ways and fast access to disseminate and consume information to/from a wider audience. Research studies have shown potential of this online information to address information needs of concerned authorities during outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. In this work, we target three types of end-users (i) vulnerable population-people who are not yet affected and are looking for prevention related information (ii) affected population-people who are affected and looking for treatment related information, and (iii) health organizations-like WHO, who are interested in gaining situational awareness to make timely decisions. We use Twitter data from two recent outbreaks (Ebola and MERS) to build an automatic classification approach useful to categorize tweets into different disease related categories. Moreover, the classified messages are used to generate different kinds of summaries useful for affected and vulnerable communities as well as health organizations. Results obtained from extensive experimentation show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

However, during an ongoing epidemic situation, in order for health organizations to effectively use this online information for response efforts or decision-making processes, the information should be processed and analyzed as quickly as possible. During an epidemic, social media users post millions of messages containing information about disease sign and symptoms, prevention strategies, transmission mediums, death reports, personal opinions and experiences.",

While the key information contained in these tweets is useful for the health experts in their decision-making process, we also observe that different disease categories contain different traits (e.g., specific symptoms characteristics), which can be exploited in order to extract and summarize relevant information.",

These are not affected people but they are vulnerable. (ii) Affected population: people who are already under the influence of disease and trying to recover from the situation.

Our proposed system tries to extract various small-scale precautionary measures like signs and symptoms (such as 'fever', 'flu', 'vomiting', 'diarrhea'), disease transmission mediums ('Transmission of Ebola Virus By Air Possible') etc., from related informational categories of tweets in order to assist these vulnerable groups. Automatic extraction of such precautionary measures or symptoms is a challenging task due to a number of reasons. For instance, we observe that such an information is floated in two flavors-(i) positive (confirmations): e.g. someone confirms that \"flu\" is a symptom of the Ebola virus or a tweet reports that people should follow x,y,z measures to avoid getting affected (ii) negative (contradictions): e.g. a tweet reports that \"fever\" is not a symptom of the Ebola virus. In this case, our system should clearly specify that \"fever\" is not a symptom of Ebola. In order to effectively tackle this, our system extracts the contextual information (positive or negative) of the terms related to precautionary measures such as symptoms, preventive suggestions and accordingly assists people during epidemics.",

Many a time, travelers from foreign countries also get affected by sudden outbreaks.

After classification of tweets into different informative categories (symptom, prevention etc.), we propose novel ILP based information extraction-summarization methods for each of the classes which extracts disease related terms and maximizes their coverage in final summary. Figure 1 provides an overview of our approach. Experiments conducted over real Twitter datasets on two recent disease outbreaks (World Health Organization (WHO) show that the proposed low-level lexical classifier outperforms vocabulary based approach (Imran et al. 2014) in cross-domain scenario (Section 4). Next, we show the utility of disease specific keyterms in capturing information from different disease related classes and summarizing those information (Section 5). We evaluate the performance of our proposed summarization scheme in Section 6. Our proposed ILP based summarization framework (MEDSUM) performs better compared to real time disaster summarization approach (COWTS) proposed by Rudra et al. (2015) . Section 7 shows how extracted information satisfies needs of various stakeholders. Finally, we conclude our paper in Section 8.",

Most of these works have focused on extracting a broad class of medical conditions (e.g., diseases, injuries, and medical symptoms) and responses (e.g., diagnoses, procedures, and drugs), with the goal of developing applications that improve patient care (Friedman et al. 1999 (Friedman et al. , 2004 Heinze et al. 2001; Hripcsak et al. 2002) . The 2010 i2b2/VA challenge (Uzuner et al. 2011) presented the task of extracting medical concepts, tests and treatments from a given dataset. Most of the techniques follow Conditional Random Field (CRF) or rule based classifiers. Roberts et al. (Roberts and Harabagiu 2011) built a flexible framework for identifying medical concepts in clinical text, and classifying assertions, which indicate the existence, absence, or uncertainty of a medical problem. The framework was evaluated on the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge data. Recently Goodwin and Harabagiu (2016) utilized this framework for building a clinical questionanswering system. They used a probabilistic knowledge graph, generated from electronic medical records (EMRs), in order to carry out answer inference. Scanfeld et al. (2010) used Q-Methodology to determine the main categories of content contained in Twitter users' status updates mentioning antibiotics. Lu et al. (2013) built a framework based on clustering analysis technique to explore interesting health-related topics in online health community. It utilized sentiment based features extracted from SentiWordNet (Esuli and Sebastiani 2007) and domain specific features from MetaMap. Denecke and Nejdl (2009) performed a comprehensive content analysis of different health related Web resources. It also classified medical weblogs according to their information type using features extracted from MetaMap. A framework based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to analyze discussion threads in a health community was proposed by Yang et al. (2016) . They first extracted medical concepts, used a modified LDA to cluster documents and finally performed sentiment analysis for each conditional topic. Recently large scale researches have been done in exploring how microblogs can be used to extract symptoms related to disease (Paul and Dredze 2011) , mental health (Homan et al. 2014 ) and so on.",

UMLS (Bodenreider 2004) , SNOMED CT (Stearns et al. 2001) ). For a given text, these systems provide extracted terms concepts of clinical terminologies that can be used to describe the content of a document in a standardized way. However, tools like MetaMap were designed specifically to process clinical documents and are thus, specialized to their linguistic characteristics (Denecke 2014) . The user-generated medical text from social media differs significantly from professionally written clinical notes. Recent studies have shown that directly applying Metamap on social media data leads to low quality word labels (Tu et al. 2016 ). There have also been works which propose methods for identifying the kind of failures MetaMap experiences when applied on social media data. Recently Park et al.

A disease independent classification of tweets requires lexical resources which provide domain knowledge and associated terms.

It comprises over 3 million concepts (virus, flu etc.), each of which is assigned to more than one of the 134 semantic types. Next, MetaMap (Aronson 2001) is used for mapping texts to UMLS concepts. For example, if MetaMap is applied over the tweet 'Cover your mouth and wear gloves there is a mers warning' then we get following set of word-concept type pairs-1. cover-Medical device, 2. mouth-Body space, 3. mers-Disease or syndrome, 4. gloves-Manufactured object, and 5. warning-Regulatory activity. As mentioned in Section 2, MetaMap does not perform well in case of short, informal texts.

SVM classifier with RBF kernel outperforms other classification models when our proposed set of features are used for training and Logistic regression model shows best performance where unigrams are considered as features. Hence, we take following two classification models for rest of the study. We compare the performance of the two feature-sets under two different scenarios (i) in-domain classification, where the tweets of same disease are used to train and test the classifier using 10-fold cross validation, and (ii) cross-domain classification, where the classifier is trained with tweets of one disease, and tested on another disease.

When we train our proposed model using Ebola dataset and test it over MERS, tweets belonging to symptom, prevention, and disease transmission classes are misclassified as non-disease in 12%, 13% and 8% of the cases respectively. A few pair of classes like 'symptoms ' and 'prevention', 'transmission' and 'prevention', etc . are inter-related.

If there is no such dependency with any negative term, then symptom s is a positive symptom of disease. We use Christopher Potts' sentiment tutorial 6 to identify strongly negative terms (e.g., never, no, wont) and Twitter dependency parser to identify the dependency relations present in a tweet. For example, in case of the tweet 'CDC announces second case of MERS virus.', the dependency tree returns following six relations -(CDC, announces), (case, announces), (second, case), (of, case), (MERS, virus), (virus, of). Table 7 shows examples of some positive and negative symptoms. After identifying both positive and negative symptoms, we try to rank them on the basis of their corpus frequency i.e., number of tweets in the corpus (symptom class) in which the symptom has been reported. However, the same symptom s I've been informed that coughing is not a symptom of Ebola might occur in multiple tweets. If a symptom s is found as a positive symptom in one tweet and also captured as a negative symptom in another tweet, then s is considered as ambiguous.

For summarization of death reports, we follow same ILP framework proposed in Section 5.3 but instead of optimizing preventive terms, here we optimize the coverage of death related terms. We consider numerals (e.g., number of casualties), keywords related to death reports, and location information as death related terms. We use Twitter-specific part-of-speech (POS) tagger (Gimpel et al. 2011) to identify POS tags for each word in the tweet. From these POS tags we select numerals for the summarization.

In the summarization, ILP framework tries to maximize the relevant class specific terms which represent a particular class. For example, in prevention category, ILP framework tries to maximize prevention related terms. If a prevention related tweet is misclassified then important terms present in that class are also wasted because such terms are not relevant to other classes (symptom, treatment etc.). Here, we measure the fraction of terms lost due to misclassification. For this analysis, ground truth is required; hence, we measure these values over manually annotated ground truth data (Section 4). We consider two different cross-domain scenarios where the model is trained over Ebola and tested over MERS and vice versa. Table 17 shows the fraction of terms missed out for symptom, prevention, and treatment class for both Ebola and MERS. For MERS, we lose around 6-8% terms for symptom, prevention and 17% terms for treatment class. Similarly, for Ebola, around 17%, 28%, and 35% terms are lost due to misclassification for symptom, prevention, and treatment classes respectively. Overall, misclassification has an impact on overall summarization output. In future, we will incorporate other distinguishing low level features to reduce misclassification rate and improve the performance of classification-summarization framework.",

To provide precise and timely information to these communities, we have presented a classification-summarization approach to extract useful information from a microblogging platform during outbreaks. The proposed classification approach uses low-level lexical class-specific features to effectively categorize raw Twitter messages. We developed a domainindependent classifier which performs better than domaindependent bag-of-words technique. Furthermore, various disease-category specific summarization approaches have been proposed. Often information posted on Twitter related to, for example, symptoms seems ambiguous for automatic information extractors. To deal with these issues, we generate separate lists representing positive and negative information. We make use of ILP techniques to generate 200-words summaries for some categories. Extensive experimentation conducted on real-world Twitter datasets from Ebola and MERS outbreaks show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
