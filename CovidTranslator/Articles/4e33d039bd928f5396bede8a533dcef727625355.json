Based on that assumption, an index case investigation was carried out. The systematic screening of contacts to confirmed MERS cases is in line with Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health recommendations. 5 The city of Amman had been experiencing a nosocomial outbreak of MERS-CoV where patient B was admitted for the femoralepopliteal bypass. 8 She had no history of travelling to any other city in Saudi Arabia that had been dealing with MERS-CoV cases. The patient's diagnosis was probably delayed due to an initial negative MERS-CoV NP swab sample, which was obtained because the patient had no cough and was unable to produce sputum. Following admission and negative NP result, infection control precautions were lifted because the patient's main complaint was an infected gangrenous foot with minimal respiratory symptoms and oxygen requirements. However, had the link between recent hospitalization of the patient in Jordan and the MERS-CoV outbreak in Jordan been noticed, more than one sample would have been obtained prior to lifting isolation precautions.",
