Additionally, there has been an evolution of thought moving away from the notion that all of CRS can be explained on the basis of sinus ostial obstruction and persistent bacterial infection to an appreciation that CRS has a significant inflammatory component that might be caused simultaneously or independently by various factors.

This decision was based on the fact that sinusitis is almost always accompanied by concurrent nasal airway inflammation, and, in many cases, sinusitis is preceded by rhinitis symptoms. Therefore, it was believed that the use of the term rhinosinusitis more accurately describes the spectrum of infectious and inflammatory conditions previously grouped under the term sinusitis. The group endorsed and adopted the previously developed definition of the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership Task Force for Rhinosinusitis: ''Rhinosinusitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the mucosa of the nose and the paranasal sinuses.'' For acute rhinosinusitis, CRS without nasal polyposis, CRS with nasal polyposis, and classic AFRS, diagnostic criteria are outlined, including the pattern of symptoms that defines each one, the typical symptoms necessary to diagnose the disease, and the objective criteria required. Measurements for monitoring progress to determine clinical efficacy are also suggested. It is hoped that the establishment of a consensus of these definitions and recommendations by recognized experts in the diagnosis and assessment of rhinosinusitis will provide clinicians and researchers with the tools necessary for developing and implementing appropriate clinical studies and serve as a catalyst for further research of rhinosinusitis.",

The presentation of AFRS might be dramatic, giving rise to acute visual loss, gross facial dysmorphia, or complete nasal obstruction, but more often, the presentation is subtle. Recent studies suggest that fungi might play an alternate role in the development of CRS, whereby patients mount innate immune responses to colonizing fungi through non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. These responses are hypothesized to lead to local eosinophilic infiltration, inflammation, and tissue injury.

It is acknowledged, however, that the histopathologic evidence of this distinction in all forms of rhinosinusitis is not carefully studied. Additionally, the 2 most hotly debated hypotheses to explain CRS relate to colonization of the sinonasal mucosa with microorganisms and the host response to their presence (eg, superantigens-producing S aureus and colonizing fungi). A substantial concern is that identifying rhinosinusitis as an infection alone might promote continued widespread use of antimicrobial agents. Current evidence to support their use, particularly in chronic disease, is limited, and there is an obvious concern that this will contribute to the increasing rates of antimicrobial resistance.",

Timing is traditionally defined on the basis of clinical onset and duration of the response. Specifically, inflammation has been referred to as acute when signs or symptoms appear over minutes to hours, subacute when it spans days to weeks, and chronic when it occurs over weeks to months. 15 The main pathologic characteristic of acute inflammation is the exudation of fluid and plasma proteins (edema) and the emigration of leukocytes, predominantly neutrophils. Chronic inflammation is histologically associated with the presence of lymphocytes, macrophages, and occasionally eosinophils and basophils and the proliferation of blood vessels, fibrosis, and tissue necrosis. 16 A clear distinction between acute and chronic inflammation is somewhat artificial because of numerous overlapping patterns of inflammation. 17 Despite the evolutionary benefits to inflammation and repair, alterations in the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators can lead to harmful effects.",

Microorganisms and rhinosinusitis Although symptoms of the common cold have been recognized since antiquity, the first cold virus, rhinovirus, was not discovered until 1956. 18 Within 30 years of its discovery, the replication strategy and atomic structure of the virus was determined. 19 The rhinovirus enters the body through the nose by means of either contaminated fingers or large airborne particles. 20 The virus is then transported in the mucus stream to the adenoid region of the nasopharynx, reaching an area where there are specialized lymphoepithelial cells (M cells) overlying lymphoid follicles. 21, 22 These lymphoepithelial cells are rich in the rhinovirus receptor intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1). 23 This series of events is very efficient. One of the central features in the pathogenesis of infections caused by rhinovirus is that in the nonimmune individual the nasal passages are unable to clear or inactivate the virus. For example, when 343 nonimmune healthy young adults were challenged by dropping rhinovirus in their nose, 321 (95%) of these individuals became infected. 24 However, only three quarters of those who became infected had symptoms of illness, reflecting an inapparent infection rate similar to that observed under natural conditions. Initiation of rhinovirus infection is not only an efficient mechanism, but also occurs quite rapidly. After intranasal rhinovirus challenge of susceptible volunteers, newly produced virus was recovered in nasal secretions within 8 to 10 hours. 25 This is the same amount of time required for rhinovirus replication in cell culture. Also, in this study symptoms were observed to appear after a relatively short time. Sore throat, nasal obstruction, and rhinorrhea were reported within 8 to 12 hours after virus challenge.",

A subset of these patients underwent repeat CT scans 2 weeks later; most of the original changes resolved spontaneously after resolution of the corresponding upper respiratory tract infection. The findings of sinus abnormalities during colds have been confirmed in adults and children. 27, 28 The nature of these findings has been debated, but one explanation is the development of thick exudates adhering to the sinus wall with such tenacity that the material is not moved by ciliary action. The epithelium of the sinus cavity contains a high concentration of goblet cells, 29, 30 and exocytosis of large amounts of mucin might occur when these cells are stimulated.

However, attention has been given to trying to define situations in which viral agents are not the sole cause; that is, the 0.5% to 2% of cases of viral rhinosinusitis that are estimated to be complicated by secondary bacterial infections. 32, 33 However, it should be recognized that no studies have ever been conducted in which the sensitivity and specificity of various clinical findings have been evaluated and the comparison standard is a positive viral or bacterial sinus aspirate culture. 33 The current clinical diagnostic criteria for a large proportion of the cases of acute community-acquired bacterial rhinosinusitis and for the use of antimicrobial treatment that is the most widely accepted today include a cold that is no better or worse after 10 to 14 days. Conversely, the current clinical diagnostic criteria for viral rhinosinusitis include a cold that is beginning to resolve after a few days and is better by a week to 10 days after onset. For purposes of research, the criteria standards for diagnosis of viral rhinosinusitis are a positive virus culture or detection of viral nucleic acid in cells of the sinus epithelium, indicating active viral replication. 34 2. Bacterial infection. Although the paranasal sinuses are believed to be sterile under normal circumstances, the upper respiratory tract, specifically the nose and nasopharynx, are heavily colonized with normal flora. 32 Normal nasal flora in adults and children include coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), Corynebacterium species, and S aureus. In children the organisms frequently cultured from the nasal cavity include S pneumoniae, M catarrhalis, and H influenzae. Normal nasal-sinus flora in patients with CRS and the role of bacterial pathogens in CRS are poorly defined. In CRS the mucosal response to bacterial colonization or bacterial infection in an otherwise normal host is likely to be different than that in acute rhinosinusitis. Given this possibility, different criteria to define colonization and infection are probably needed but have not been established. a. Microbiology of acute rhinosinusitis in children. The microbiology of paranasal sinus infection can be anticipated according to the age of the patient, clinical presentation, and immunocompetency of the host. Despite the substantial prevalence and clinical importance of rhinosinusitis in childhood, studies of the microbiology of acute and subacute rhinosinusitis in pediatric patients have been relatively limited. By using a study design similar to one described by investigators at the University of Virginia, 35 an investigation of the microbiology of acute sinusitis in pediatric patients was conducted at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh in 1979. 36 Patients were eligible for this study if they were between 2 and 16 years of age and presented with one of 2 clinical pictures: onset with either persistent or severe respiratory symptoms.",

When a maxillary sinus aspirate (by using a transnasal approach) was performed on children presenting with either persistent or severe symptoms and significantly abnormal sinus radiographs, bacteria in high density were recovered from 70%. 37 The bacterial isolates in their relative order of prevalence are shown in Table I . S pneumoniae was most common, followed closely by M catarrhalis and H influenzae. Both H influenzae and M catarrhalis might be b-lactamase producing and thereby amoxicillin resistant. Approximately a third of S pneumoniae also exhibit intermediate or high resistance to penicillin. The H influenzae found in sinus aspirates, like those found in infected middle ear cavities, are almost always the nontypeable organisms, reflecting their frequent colonization of the nasopharynx, in contrast to H influenzae type b. Only a single anaerobic bacterial species, a peptostreptococcus, was isolated. No staphylococci were recovered. Mixed infection with heavy growth of 2 bacterial species was occasionally found. In 25% of patients with bilateral maxillary sinusitis, there were discordant bacterial culture results. In some patients one sinus aspirate was positive, whereas the other was negative. In the remaining patients different bacterial species were recovered from each. b. Microbiology of subacute rhinosinusitis in children.",

            "text": "The signs and symptoms of children with subacute rhinosinusitis were described in 1989. 38 These youngsters were evaluated in the context of several different comparative trials of antimicrobial therapy. All children had persistent respiratory symptoms (ie, nasal discharge, cough, or both lasting between 30 and 120 days). These children were generally in good health, with minimal constitutional complaints, except for their respiratory symptoms. Intermittent fever was a complaint in 25% of patients but was rarely documented at the time of presentation. Some of these children had previously received one or more courses of antimicrobial agents. In each case they either failed to respond to the antimicrobial agent or improved only slightly and experienced recurrence of symptoms after cessation of antibiotics. Table II shows the bacterial species cultured from 40 children. Again, the 3 predominant organisms were S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis. 38 c. Microbiology of CRS in children. There have been 9 studies of the microbiology of CRS in children between 1981 and 2001 (Table III) . [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] Three of these studies were prospective 40, 42, 43 and 6 were retrospective. In all but one study, the maxillary sinus was sampled by means of transnasal aspiration. The most common criterion for evaluation was symptoms for at least 90 days. An attempt was made to sterilize the nose in only 5 of 9 investigations. Quantitation of bacteria was rarely performed. In part, this was a result of the frequent need for irrigation of the maxillary sinus to obtain sufficient material for culture. In 6 studies patients were receiving antibiotics up to the time that cultures were obtained. In 2 of the studies, normal nasal flora were the usual organisms recovered (ie, CNS and viridians streptococci). It is difficult to know what pathologic significance to ascribe to CNS. In the remaining studies the usual sinus pathogens were recovered in about 60% of cases (ie, H influenzae, S pneumoniae, and M catarrhalis, with H influenzae being most common). This was especially true when the criteria for entry included purulent secretions. In the remaining 30% to 40% of children, other organisms were recovered. Except for 2 studies, both performed by Brook and associates, anaerobes were rarely recovered from children with CRS. 39 In patients with acute exacerbations of CRS characterized by persistent or intermittent episodes of purulent nasal discharge, the usual microorganisms associated with acute sinusitis are causative. However, in patients with chronic persistent rhinosinusitis (nasal congestion or nonspecific rhinorrhea or cough, alone or in combination), the role of bacterial agents is less clear. Most organisms have been recovered in low density, and frequently, these were recovered at a time when the patient was receiving antibiotics to which the organisms were susceptible. The lack of quantitation of organisms also complicates interpretation because the middle meatus in children is known to be colonized with the usual sinus pathogens. The persistence of symptoms despite multiple courses of appropriate antimicrobial agents in many children is counter to the notion that bacterial infection is a significant component of CRS. All of these observations support the hypothesis that bacterial infection has a minor role in many children with CRS. d. Microbiology of acute community-acquired rhinosinusitis in adults. In adults bacteriologic information is derived mainly from cultures of mucus obtained by means of aspiration from the maxillary sinus, the most accessible of the paranasal sinuses. Although there is no certainty that cultures from the maxillary sinus can be extrapolated to all the other paranasal sinuses, the findings of sinus puncture studies performed in the United States and abroad have provided fairly similar results. In general, a sinus infection is caused by a single bacterial isolate in high density. 35 In 25% of cases, 2 bacterial species, each in high density, were recovered. The 2 most important causes of acute communityacquired rhinosinusitis in adults are S pneumoniae and nontypeable H influenzae (Table IV) . These 2 species account for more than 75% of the bacterial isolates. One remarkable change observed by Gwaltney and colleagues between 1975 and 1991 was the increase in the prevalence of b-lactamase-producing H influenzae. In the first decade, b-lactamase-mediated resistance was rare; however, from 1986 through 1991, more than half of 29 strains of H influenzae were b-lactamase producing. 32 There has been no increase in b-lactamase-positive H influenzae over the last 10 years, and this mechanism of resistance appears to have stabilized at less than 40% of isolates. 48, 49 Next in frequency were streptococci other than pneumococci, such as streptococcal a and b strains, and anaerobic bacterial species. The role of anaerobes in acute community-acquired disease is variable. Although anaerobic bacteria have a more remarkable role in chronic sinus disease, they are not as established in acute sinus disease and account for only 2% to 6% of acute cases, some of which arise from primary dental pathology.",

The actual role of S aureus might occasionally be exaggerated when surrogate nasal cultures are substituted for sinus aspirates. Although uncommon, S aureus and S pyogenes may cause serious intracranial suppuration or, rarely, subperiosteal or orbital abscess as complications of acute rhinosinusitis. e. Microbiology of nosocomial rhinosinusitis. Patients with nosocomial rhinosinusitis are usually those who require extended periods of intensive care (postoperative patients, burn victims, and patients with severe trauma) involving prolonged endotracheal or nasogastric intubation. 50 Nasotracheal intubation provides a substantially higher risk for nosocomial sinusitis than orotracheal intubation. 51 Nosocomial rhinosinusitis develops in approximately 25% of patients requiring nasotracheal intubation for more than 5 days. 52 In contrast to communityacquired rhinosinusitis, samples taken from hospitalized patients usually contain pathogens that are gram-negative enterics (eg, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens) and gram-positive cocci (occasionally streptococci and staphylococci). [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] Whether these organisms actually cause the original sinus disease is unclear; however, they might represent postsurgical colonization of an environment with impaired mucociliary transport caused by the presence of a foreign body in the nasal cavity. Table V . [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] Three studies were prospective. The importance of a prospective investigation is that there is more assurance that patients are identified and cultures are processed in a standard fashion. CNS was the most common aerobic isolate in 5 of the 7 studies, often accompanied by S aureus and viridians streptococci. The absence of quantitation or performance of Gram stains in almost all studies prohibits an assessment of both the density of organisms and the accompaniment of an inflammatory response. Although CNS is traditionally discounted as a pathogen in both acute rhinosinusitis and CRS, its role as a pathogen in other body sites has been well documented and reviewed by Hsu et al 59 : neutropenic sepsis, infections of indwelling catheters, and in burn patients. Frequent bacterial recovery from swabs obtained from the middle meatus of healthy subjects suggests that these bacteria are commensals and likely contaminants. 64 Nadel et al 65 suggested that the difference might be of a quantitative nature. In the unusual situation in which a large number of white blood cells and organisms were present on Gram stains and there was heavy growth of CNS, the possibility of a true infection should be entertained.",

Obviously, more work is needed to resolve these discrepant data. A suggested strategy would be to conduct a prospective investigation in which (1) patients are carefully identified and characterized, (2) cultures and Gram stains are obtained by using aseptic techniques with rigorous and standardized handling of specimens, (3) at least semiquantitative culture methods are used so that the density of bacteria can be assessed, and (4) the inflammatory infiltrate is characterized as neutrophilic or eosinophilic (which mark different pathogenic mechanisms). g. New insights into the role of bacteria in CRS. 1) BACTERIAL SUPERANTIGENS. A number of bacteria, viruses, and fungi can produce exotoxins (sometimes referred to as enterotoxins) that are able to activate T lymphocytes by cross-linking the MHC II molecule on antigen-presenting cells with the variable beta (Vb) region of the T-cell receptor. These exotoxins are termed superantigens because they activate subpopulations representing up to 30% of T lymphocytes in contrast to classical antigens, which activate less than 0.01% of T lymphocytes. In addition, superantigens can also act as classical antigens, leading to concomitant generation of anti-superantigen antibodies. These includes antibodies of the IgE isotypes. 5, 6 A potential role for superantigens from S aureus in the pathogenesis of nasal polyposis has been suggested and is discussed in the section ''Factors involved in nasal polyposis.'' 2) BIOFILMS. A biofilm is a communicating organization of microorganisms surrounded by a glycocalyx that frequently forms on an artificial or damaged biologic surface. Organisms living in a biofilm are relatively impervious to host defenses and antimicrobial agents. Bacterial biofilms have been elegantly demonstrated in an animal model of otitis media by using scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy. 1 The possibility that a bacterial biofilm could be contributing to CRS has not been formally studied. This possibility is theoretically attractive and might help to explain the clinical situation in which patients frequently have negative cultures, improve symptomatically while receiving antibiotics, and relapse when antibiotics are withdrawn. In a biofilm, planktonic bacteria leave the biofilm, cause symptoms, and are susceptible to host defenses and antibiotics. However, the biofilm itself is relatively impervious to antimicrobial agents and is never eradicated. Mechanical debridement appears to be the only mechanism that resolves a biofilm. In some refractory patients this might explain improvement with surgery and irrigation.",

A study by Khalid et al 2 using both Pseudomonas species and S aureus in a rabbit study demonstrated similar results. Bone involvement was noted in 92% of the animals on the ipsilateral side to the infection, and in some specimens clear osteonecrosis was identified. Inflammatory bone changes were also noted on the contralateral side in 52% of the animals. The inflammation caused welldefined changes in the bone in rabbits, both adjacent to the infection and at a distance from the primary site of inflammation, which were compatible with a histologic diagnosis of chronic osteomyelitis. The inflammatory spread within the bone appears to occur as a result of well-defined changes in the Haversian canals, leading first to widening of the canals and increased vascularity, then to an inflammatory cellular collection within the canals, and later to fibrosis in the involved area. It is certainly possible that these changes, if further confirmed in patients, might, at least in part, explain why CRS is relatively resistant to medical therapy.",

Fungal colonization of the nose and paranasal sinuses appears to be a common finding in both normal and diseased states, although there is considerable debate over the prevalence of colonization. [7] [8] [9] Fungal colonization is presumed to be due to the ubiquitous nature of fungal spores in ambient air and the propensity of these spores to germinate in nasal and sinus mucus. In rare circumstances this leads to macroscopic fungal proliferation in the form of fungus balls (formerly referred to as mycetomas) or saprophytic growth of fungus. In these cases fungal mycelia accumulate and occupy available spaces within the nose and paranasal sinuses in the absence of significant mucosal inflammation. Treatment is simply directed toward extirpation of the offending fungal growth. 74 Occurring more commonly than in the case of fungus balls, microscopic quantities of fungal hyphae in sinus mucus elicit an intense local immune response. In AFRS this gives rise to the pathognomonic feature of the disease, namely the presence of allergic mucin (described below).

            "text": "Invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is often an acute fulminant disease that carries a high mortality rate. Acute fulminant invasive fungal rhinosinusitis is usually caused by fungi such as Absidia species, Aspergillus species, Basidiobolus species, Mucor species, and Rhizopus species. 75 However, in patients whose immunologic deficiency is mild or unapparent, invasive fungal rhinosinusitis might run a more indolent chronic course. The diagnosis is made on the basis of histologic evidence of invasive fungi in the nose and paranasal sinuses that is present for more than 12 weeks. Management requires repeated surgical debridements, correction of any immunologic deficiency, and long-term systemic and topical antifungal therapy. Despite close medical attention, all invasive cases of fungal rhinosinusitis can progress to a fatal outcome or become a recurrent problem. Chronic invasive fungal rhinosinusitis has been divided into granulomatous and nongranulomatous subtypes on the basis of histopathology; however, the clinical distinction in terms of prognosis and management between these 2 subtypes is not clear. Chronic invasive fungal rhinosinusitis has been specifically associated with Aspergillus species, Mucor species, Alternaria species, Curvularia species, Bipolaris species, Candida species, Sporothrix schenckii, and Pseudallescheria boydii. 74, 76 Traditional classification of fungal rhinosinusitis emphasizes differentiating these diseases on the basis of the presence or absence of tissue invasion. Little emphasis has been placed on differentiation of fungal inflammation induced by colonization versus infection. There is little question that the invasive forms of fungal rhinosinusitis constitute infection, but the issue of whether the noninvasive forms represent infection versus inflammation in response to colonizing fungi offers more confusion. At present, current data suggest that the mucosal inflammatory process with noninvasive fungal colonization represents a noninfectious process. 8, 77 a. Allergy to fungi. Unlike invasive forms of fungal rhinosinusitis, it is the potential for colonizing fungi to elicit allergic mucosal inflammation in the absence of invasion that characterizes AFRS. The ability of fungi or, more specifically, protein components of fungi to elicit IgE-mediated allergic mucosal inflammation is well documented. 78 Moreover, when those sensitized individuals are placed in environments of high fungal exposure, symptoms of airway hyperresponsiveness increase significantly over those of nonsensitized individuals in similar situations. 79 Virtually all studies of the pathophysiology of AFRS have been based on the premise that IgEmediated allergy to one or more fungi underlie the disease, with the predominant finding of eosinophil-predominant tissue infiltration akin to late-phase allergic inflammation. In this way AFRS has features quite similar to those of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. 80 b. Classic AFRS. Over the course of the past 25 years, AFRS has emerged as a clinically distinct subset of CRS. AFRS possesses characteristic clinical, radiographic, pathologic, and immunologic features. 1) HISTORY AND PHYSICAL. Occasionally, the presentation of AFRS might be dramatic, giving rise to acute visual loss, gross facial dysmorphia (described below), or complete nasal obstruction, 80-82 but more often, the presentation of AFRS is subtle. Patients typically complain of gradual nasal airway obstruction and production of semisolid nasal crusts that, on inquiry, match the gross description of allergic fungal mucin. The development of nasal airway obstruction might have been so gradual that the patient is unaware of its presence. Pain is uncommon among patients with AFRS and suggests the concomitant presence of a bacterial rhinosinusitis. 83, 84 In contrast to the often subtle symptoms of AFRS, physical findings are often more remarkable. The range of physical findings on examination is typically broad, ranging from nasal airway obstruction resulting from intranasal inflammation and polyposis to gross facial disfigurement and orbital or ocular abnormalities. 81 2) RADIOLOGIC FINDINGS. The slow accumulation of allergic fungal mucin provides unique and rather predictable characteristics to the disease. Allergic fungal mucin is sequestered within involved paranasal sinus cavities, and its accumulation eventually leads to the increasingly wellrecognized radiographic findings characteristic of AFRS (Table VI) . A recent study of sinus CT scans from 45 patients with AFRS objectively supports several previous clinical observations. 85 AFRS, although bilateral in 51% of the cases reviewed, caused asymmetric involvement of the paranasal sinuses in 78% of the cases. Bone erosion and extension of disease into adjacent anatomic areas was encountered in 20% of the patients and was more likely to occur in the presence of bilateral advanced disease. Expansion, remodeling, or thinning of involved sinus walls was common (and was thought to be due to the expansile nature of the accumulating mucin). These finding were corroborated by Nussenbaum, et al, 86 who reviewed CT scans of 142 patients treated for AFRS at a single institution and also found demineralization of bone in approximately 20% of the subjects.",

            "text": "It is the production of allergic mucin that is considered pathognomonic of AFRS. Grossly, allergic mucin is thick, tenacious, and highly viscous in consis-tency; its color can vary from light tan to brown or dark green. 93, 94 It is the mucin, rather than paranasal sinus mucosa, that provides the histologic information necessary to make the diagnosis of AFRS. 95, 96 Examination of mucosa and polyps obtained from involved paranasal sinuses reveal findings of chronic inflammation, usually with an abundance of eosinophils. Pathologic examination of these tissues should be done to establish that fungal invasion is not present. 96 The histologic appearance of allergic mucin reveals the characteristic findings of branching noninvasive fungal hyphae within sheets of eosinophils and Charcot-Leyden crystals. [97] [98] [99] Hematoxylin and eosin staining accentuates the mucin and cellular components of allergic fungal mucin but fails to stain the fungal hyphae. Fungi are recognized for a unique ability to absorb silver. This is the basis for various silver stains, such as Grocott's or Gomori's methamine silver stain, which stain fungi black or dark brown. Unfortunately, silver-based stains have high specificity but low sensitivity. A more sensitive method for identification of fungi has been recently developed that makes use of a fluorescein-labeled chitin-specific binding protein. In a study that compared mucus retrieved from 54 patients with CRS, use of this technique allowed for identification of fungal elements in 100% of specimens, whereas fungi were only detected in 41 (76%) of the 54 specimens by using a Grocott stain. 100 Using this technique, Taylor et al 100 identified fungal hyphae in the vast majority of sinus mucus samples obtained from patients with CRS, even though most of these patients lacked the other classic features of AFRS. This has become one of the major tenets of the hypothesis associated with the concept of eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis (see below). 5) CULTURE OF FUNGI. Fungal cultures of allergic fungal mucin might provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of AFRS but must be interpreted with caution. It is important to realize that the diagnosis of AFRS is neither established nor eliminated on the basis of the results of these cultures. The variable yield of fungal cultures (64% to 100%) renders AFRS in the presence of a negative fungal culture quite possible. 84 Conversely, a positive fungal culture fails to confirm the diagnosis of AFRS because it might merely represent the presence of saprophytic fungal growth. For this reason, the histologic appearance of allergic mucin remains the most reliable indicator of AFRS. 6) DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA. The constellation of clinical, radiographic, and immunologic features help to define the disease and have been the focus of a number of diagnostic criteria. 101, 102 Those patients with AFRS uniformly demonstrated 5 characteristics: gross production of eosinophilic mucin containing noninvasive fungal hyphae, nasal polyposis, characteristic radiographic findings, immunocompetence, and allergy to fungi. 102 Taking into account the current literature, the diagnosis of AFRS is minimally dependent on identifying the combination of histologic evidence of fungal hyphae within eosinophilic mucin and host allergy to that fungus. The diagnosis might be suspected on the basis of physical examination or radiographic findings; however, in most cases the diagnosis is not established until sinus tissue and mucus obtained during sinus surgery have been reviewed. At the time of surgery, the patient might have a persistently opacified sinus cavity, and eosinophilic mucus plus polypoid tissue might be found to account for this opacification. Patients nearly always have type I allergic sensitivity to fungal antigens. Because of these distinctive features plus the distinctive complications of this disease, including bony erosion and facial dysmorphia, AFRS represents a distinct subset from the much broader group of patients with CRS. c. Non-IgE-mediated eosinophilic fungal inflammation (eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis). In 1999, a hypothesis of CRS was proposed by Ponikau et al 103 that suggested colonizing fungi in sinus mucus play a much broader role in the pathogenesis of CRS. By using an ultrasensitive culture technique, 93% of 101 consecutive patients with CRS demonstrated positive fungal cultures from nasal lavage. Examination of surgically obtained specimens from these patients also revealed eosinophils and fungal hyphae in the sinus mucus of nearly all patients. It was also observed that 100% of a group of healthy control subjects had positive fungal cultures from nasal lavage. Conventional IgE-mediated allergy to fungi was not consistently observed in the patients with CRS. It was proposed that virtually all cases of CRS were associated with sensitization to colonizing fungi. It was further suggested that the term allergic fungal rhinosinusitis be replaced with eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis. 103 An intriguing issue raised by this study is the possibility that certain fungi could elicit eosinophilic inflammation in the absence of conventional IgE in subjects with CRS. This concept was supported by in vitro studies in which PBMCs from patients with CRS were found to produce large quantities of IL-5 and IL-13 after exposure to certain fungal antigens. 104 In contrast, PBMCs obtained from healthy control subjects failed to produce the same response. Thus patients with CRS show evidence of sensitization and immune activation in response to colonizing fungi in the nasal and sinus mucus, and this process might be responsible for the production of cytokines that recruit and activate eosinophils in CRS. For further discussion of this issue, see the section ''Controversy 3: Should CRS be classified on the basis of the proposed definition of eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis.''",

            "text": "1. Allergic inflammation. The contribution of allergic responses in CRS has long been controversial. Nonetheless, there is now evidence that at least perennial allergic rhinitis could be a facilitating factor for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, as demonstrated in a prospective sinus CT scan study. 105 Although seasonal allergic rhinitis has been shown to be a risk factor for orbital complications of acute rhinosinusitis in children, 106 similar evidence is not available for acute rhinosinusitis in adults. In a mouse model allergic inflammation induced by means of sensitization to ovalbumin has also been demonstrated to augment the inflammatory response to acute bacterial infection. 107 Furthermore, allergic reactivity is a poor prognostic factor after surgery in some, but not all, studies. 108 Most studies of allergic factors in CRS involved studies of NPs. The results of these studies are unclear. Slightly less than half of the patients with CRS and NPs have associated allergies. 109 Furthermore, seasonal allergen exposure does not increase symptoms or mediators in the nasal lavage of patients with NPs and ragweed sensitivity. 110 However, there is a substantial discordance between skin prick tests and evidence of local IgE antibody levels in polyp homogenates. 13 As early as 1982, Drake-Lee and McLaughlin 111 reported their finding of IgE antibody in NPs and no difference in local IgE levels in allergic and nonallergic subjects. Recent studies have found IgE in NPs specific for enterotoxins from S aureus, which act as superantigens resulting in a multiclonal stimulation of T and B lymphocytes. 13 Another study reported skewing of the Vb phenotype of T lymphocytes in NPs toward those responsive to staphylococcal exotoxins detected in the tissues. 112 It has been repeatedly demonstrated, at least qualitatively speaking, that neither IgE levels nor ECP, IL-4, or IL-5 concentrations in NPs differentiate atopic versus nonatopic subjects, indicating that the phenotype of systemic allergy defined as skin prick test positivity does not correlate with the local features of allergic inflammation in NPs. 113 The full explanation for these findings remains elusive, but the implication is that local inflammatory mechanisms might be important in NP pathogenesis. Furthermore, a positive skin test response in a patient with CRS should not be interpreted as an allergic case of CRS. One exception to this rule is AFRS, in which a systemic allergic response to fungi colonizing the sinus mucus is demonstrated in the vast majority of cases (see section ''Controversy 3: Should CRS be classified on the basis of the proposed definition of eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis'').",

Also similar to results in patients with NPs, the T-cell cytokine profiles of allergic and nonallergic subjects with CRS show differences precisely as described in subjects with NPs, namely that the full cadre of T H 2 cytokines is found in allergic subjects, and a mixed T H 1/T H 2 profile is found in nonallergic subjects. 115 However, once again, the degree of tissue infiltration with eosinophils is not substantially different in allergic and nonallergic subjects, raising the question of the relevance of systemic allergic phenotype to the underlying pathogenesis. 2. Other inflammatory features. In CRS (without NPs) a range of mediators and cytokines has been shown to be increased in comparison with levels seen in control tissue, mostly inferior turbinates. These include IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-a, IL-3, GM-CSF, ICAM-1, myeloperoxidase, and ECP. 114, [116] [117] [118] [119] CRS is characterized by a predominantly neutrophilic inflammation, with a lesser contribution of eosinophils. Interestingly, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), an adhesion molecule involved in selective eosinophil recruitment, and IL-5, a key cytokine for eosinophil survival and activity, have been shown not to be increased. 117, 118 This cytokine and mediator profile resembles very much the profile found in acute viral rhinosinusitis, with the exception of a small, although significant, increase of ECP. These findings therefore suggest that the underlying pathologic process might involve unresolved inflammation after infection or a response to chronic infection. This profile is distinct from the pattern in NP. 13, 118, 120 By comparison, many more studies have been done to describe the inflammation in NPs (see section ''Factors involved in nasal polyposis''). A hallmark inflammatory feature is the presence of abundant eosinophils. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the presence of eosinophils in NPs, as discussed below.",

SAEs furthermore stimulate T cells by binding to the variable b chain of the T-cell receptor, which induce cytokine production of IL-4 and IL-5, directly activate eosinophils and prolong their survival, and also might directly activate epithelial cells to release chemokines. 122 SAEs furthermore activate antigen-presenting cells to increase antigen uptake. In fact, when comparing SAE-IgE 1 NPs with SAE-IgE 2 NPs, the number of IgE 1 cells and eosinophils is significantly increased. The more severe inflammation is also reflected by significantly increased levels of IL-5, ECP, and total IgE in the NPs. In conclusion, SAEs are able to induce a more severe eosinophilic inflammation, as well as the synthesis of a multiclonal IgE response with high total IgE concentrations in the tissue, which would suggest that SAEs are at least modifiers of disease in NP. 122 Interestingly, similar findings have recently been reported in asthma, which is known to occur concurrently with nasal polyposiss. 123 IgE antibody formation to SAE is rarely seen in CRS in the absence of NPs.",

The following sections will review the various causal factors for rhinosinusitis, with emphasis on noninfectious and nonimmunologic causes. b. Neutrophilic rhinitis. The neutrophilic group includes acute bacterial sinusitis, cystic fibrosis, and chronic bacterial infections complicating immunodeficiencies and foreign bodies. Nasal polyps with neutrophilia in children are highly suggestive of cystic fibrosis. c. Mixed inflammatory patterns. Complex mixed or as yet poorly defined nasal mucosal cell populations are present in viral infection, autoimmune diseases, and idiopathic diseases. The leukocytes attracted to the nasal and sinus mucosa vary with the chronology and specific virus causing acute common cold syndromes (rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, coronavirus, and others), influenza (might cause epithelial destruction), potentially sterile (nonbacterial) rhinosinusitis, or adenoiditis. Because the time course of leukocyte invasion is different for specific leukocyte populations, it is necessary to synchronize the day after initiation of infection to follow this time course. This can be achieved only in longitudinal studies of groups inoculated with virus and not by crosssectional studies in which the date of onset of the infection is not documented precisely. Autoimmune, vasculitic, and other complex syndromes are included in this group by virtue of these poorly defined, mixed cellular populations. Lymphocytic infiltrates of T cells with CD4 or CD8 derivations might be present but might also change with the stage or duration of illness. An example would be sarcoidosis, with its predominance of T H 1 lymphocytes and macrophages in noncaseating granuloma. d. Epithelial dysplasia. Epithelial changes occur as CRS progresses from mild to severe. The epithelium shows an inexorable trend from normal ciliated to goblet cells predominant, microvillous cell predominant, and ultimately squamous epithelium with breaches in the basement membrane and surface erythrocytes, indicating bleeding. This epithelial progression roughly parallels CT scan severity. 126 Exposures to organic toxins, fine particulate material, oxidizing minerals (eg, iron), and other materials can lead to epithelial differentiation from ciliated to squamous metaplasia without leukocytosis. The olfactory mucosa might be particularly susceptible. An example of this type of response is the exposure to complex particulates. Some toxins cause an early and transient neutrophilic inflammation that clears rapidly once the exposure has ended. These types of changes have been examined in rodent and screening toxicologic studies, but there are much fewer data in human exposure situations. 127 2. Noninflammatory changes.",

            "text": "The second large group is the set of noninflammatory syndromes that do not show any changes in normal leukocyte infiltration. a. Trigeminal dysfunction. Many of these disorders involve afferent trigeminal and efferent autonomic nerves. They are often dismissed as a functional disorder of nasal complaints without physical findings and lumped together as vasomotor rhinitis (idiopathic rhinitis). This is a misnomer that does no justice to the patient or his or her complaints. Perennial noninfectious, nonallergic rhinitis is an alternative term. There are no clear vascular, motor, or inflammatory cellular patterns. Inquiries about key historical issues can classify and direct therapy to these symptomatic and frustrated patients. These individuals appear to have increased afferent trigeminal nerve sensitivity to inhaled irritants, disordered axon response mechanisms, and potentially altered dorsal horn processing of nociceptive input that contribute to increased perception of these mucosal or visceral stimuli and hence greater complaints of symptoms. An alternative term, irritant rhinitis, describes the syndrome more accurately. 128 Patients with irritant rhinitis typically complain of nasal congestion and rhinorrhea in response to weather, temperature and humidity changes, and irritants, such as tobacco smoke, 129 gasoline fumes, perfumes and cleaning solutions, beer, and wine. An important function of type C nociceptive neurons is their role in immediate neurogenic responses to noxious stimuli. 130 New information about the nature of nociceptive sensors, such as the capsaicinsensitive ion channel receptor (VR1, recently renamed transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily protein or TRPV1) offers a new understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to irritant gases, fine particulate material, cigarette smoke components, osmolarity, and temperature changes. 131 b. Cholinergic rhinitis. The afferent stimuli can recruit overactive parasympathetic cholinergic reflexes that mediate cholinergic (muscarinic receptor M3-mediated) glandular secretion. This mucus hypersecretion might confound observations of mucopurulent discharge and therefore suggest that rhinosinusitis is present. The effectiveness of anticholinergic agents suggests that parasympathetic cholinergic outflow is the major factor contributing to chronic or long-lasting irritant-induced (eg, cold dry air in skiers) nasal discharge in nonallergic rhinitis. Acute stimulation of nociceptive nerves (eg, by eating capsaicin-laden foods that stimulate vanilloid receptor 1 bearing type C trigeminal neurons) also recruits overwhelming lacrimal, nasal, and salivary glandular discharge. When excessive, this is termed cholinergic rhinitis. Again, anticholinergic agents are effective at blocking this CNS trigeminal-facial (Vidian parasympathetic) nerve-mediated reflex. c. Sympathetic dysfunction. Impaired sympathetic outflow can lead to default dilatation of venous sinusoids. This thickens the mucosa and reduces the cross-sectional area for airflow and therefore leads to obstructed nasal airflow. Horner syndrome is an example. d. Other. Hormonal, structural, and neoplastic disorders also lead to symptoms, including referred pain suggestive of rhinosinusitis. The hormones of pregnancy are notorious for causing nasal obstruction symptoms that can be very problematic to patients. This congestion clears with delivery of the placenta. Hypothyroidism leads to sympathetic dysfunction with ineffective noradrenergic effects and the absence of venous sinusoid vasoconstriction that results in default blood pooling and thickening of the nasal mucosa. Drugs that block this vasoconstrictor function (central and peripheral acting antihypertensive agents) will also lead to mucosal thickening and nasal obstruction to airflow.",

CRS might represent a better model to investigate neurogenic changes because of the larger magnitude of the hyperalgesia. Studies in patients with rhinosinusitis are just beginning. An important finding of this study was that subjects with chronic fatigue syndrome, particularly those who complain of CRS, had significantly lower sinus pain thresholds than the control group, as well as the acute rhinosinusitis and CRS groups. 132 This is of importance because many of these subjects have normal sinus CT scans and carry the diagnosis of nonallergic irritant rhinitis.

Although rhinosinusitis symptoms can and do occur in patients with typical GERD, 149 studies have shown that 57% to 94% of patients with ear, nose, and throat symptoms do not have typical GERD. 150 The pathophysiology of this condition is believed to be direct contact of the upper airway with gastric contents, including acid and pepsin; duodenal contents, including bile acids and pancreatic enzymes like trypsin; or both. Vagal-mediated reflexes have also been implicated. Additional possible mechanisms include defective upper esophageal sphincter pressure, esophageal dysmotility, and poor acid clearance. 151 The diagnosis of supraesophageal reflux is somewhat difficult. The tests commonly used to diagnose GERD are less effective in SERD. 152 These include upper gastrointestinal examination, endoscopy, the Bernstein acid perfusion test, manometry, and reflux scintiscanning. More effective tests for making the diagnosis of SERD include 24-hour pH monitoring, the gold standard, or an empiric therapeutic trial. 152 An empiric therapeutic trial would not be useful for a research study unless one first did a placebo-controlled empiric treatment trial to determine eligibility for the proposed research. The probe should be placed in the proximal esophagus (2 cm above the upper esophageal sphincter) or in the pharynx. 153 When this is accomplished, there is high specificity (90% to 100%); however, sensitivity varies from 55% to 95%. 152, 154 There are 2 studies that address the role of acid suppression in treating CRS. 155, 156 Both studies were open treatment protocols in children with difficult-tomanage CRS. Dual pH probe monitoring was performed, but not all enrolled subjects in one of the trials had SERD. 155 In any case patients were noted to improve in both studies. 6.

Recent studies examining the histology of middle turbinate tissues from subjects with polypoid versus nonpolypoid disease support the distinction between them. In the study by Malekzadeh et al, 164 preoperative sinus CT scans and histologic specimens of middle turbinates obtained during sinus surgery were examined retrospectively in 34 patients and compared with those of 7 control patients who underwent cosmetic and spenopalatine surgery. CT scan severity was classified according to the May classification. 165 Tissue sections were stained for mucus cells in glands with Alcian Blue. Goblet cells were often not present because of epithelial metaplasia. The area of tissue sections below the epithelial basement membrane were assessed by means of digitized image analysis, and the percentage area stained blue was determined (Fig 7) . Normal (May class 0) and mild (May class I) sinusitis showed approximately 6% mucous cells in nasal airway mucosa. A similar percentage was found in class II. However, these subjects could be divided into those with relatively normal histology and those who showed cobblestoned mucosa or small polyps during surgery. This was accompanied by suggestions of increased mucosal edema. As shown by Biedlingmaier and Trifillis, 126 these subjects have goblet cell metaplasia with a decrease in ciliated cells. A major difference in mucosal histology was seen in class III. One population of subjects showed thickened mucosa on visual inspection and had glandular mucous cell hyperplasia, with 22% of the mucosa stained with Alcian Blue. This indicates that some mechanism was active to cause glandular hyperplasia. Potential mechanisms could be similar to those suggested for chronic bronchitis and murine models showing IL-13-induced goblet cell hyperplasia. The other population of patients had visual evidence of polyposis. The histology from the patients with polyps showed a decrease in percentage Alcian Blue area as disease severity worsened from class II to class IV (pansinusitis). Ultimately, the polypoid degeneration totally obliterated normal mucosal histology in the region of the polyp root. Patients with polypoid disease were also more likely to manifest changes of pansinusitis on sinus CT. These results strongly suggest that distinct molecular mechanisms underly the polypoid and glandular hypertrophy subsets of CRS.",

            "text": "As previously stated, the histology of the epithelium has also been noted to change with radiographic disease severity, as assessed with the May classification. 126 Normal nasal epithelium is ciliated and pseudostratified. In class I and II these cells are replaced by goblet cells. In class III microvillous cells are the predominant population. Squamous metaplasia is present in class IV. Erythrocytes and patches of denuded epithelium are also seen. This suggests a mechanism for invasion of microbes through the usually protective lining. In essence, the nasal and sinus mucosa differentiates into a skin-like squamous epithelium. These epithelial changes offer novel ecologic niches for microbial colonization and invasion. This might explain the differences in bacterial organisms cultured from acute rhinosinusitis (presumably ciliated epithelium) versus CRS (microvillous to squamous epithelium) groups. These epithelial changes are amenable to treatment and might improve with intensive therapy after surgery. 169 Polypoid and nonpolypoid CRS (CRSwNP vs CRSsNP) also generally show different patterns in cellular content and gross histologic changes within the tissue, especially edema and fibrosis formation. In the sinus fluid of patients with CRSsNP undergoing surgery, inflammatory cells are predominantly neutrophils, as is observed in acute sinusitis, but a low percentage of eosinophils, mast cells and basophils might also be found. 170, 171 In a recent study evaluating the percentage of eosinophils (of 1000 inflammatory cells counted per vision field), 31 patients with untreated chronic sinusitis without NPs all had less than 10% eosinophils (overall mean, 2%), whereas in specimens from 123 untreated patients with NPs, 108 samples showed more than 10% eosinophils (overall mean 50%). 172 Among the inflammatory cells, EG2 1 (activated) eosinophils are a prominent and characteristic feature in about 80% of patients with CRSwNP. 173 Eosinophils are localized around the vessels and glands and directly beneath the mucosal epithelium. 174 The mucosal lining in patients with CRSsNP is characterized by basement membrane thickening, goblet cell hyperplasia, limited subepithelial edema, prominent fibrosis, and mononuclear cell infiltration. Histomorphologic characterization of NP tissue (CRSwNP) reveals frequent epithelial damage, a thickened basement membrane, and mostly edematous to sometimes fibrotic stromal tissue, with a reduced number of vessels and glands but virtually no neuronal structures. [174] [175] [176] The stroma of mature polyps is mainly characterized by its edematous nature and consists of supporting fibroblasts and infiltrating inflammatory cells localized around empty pseudocyst formations. In small polyps, not larger than 5 mm, growing on normal-looking mucosa of the middle turbinate in patients with bilateral polyposis, early processes of polyp growth have been studied. 177 Numerous subepithelial EG2 1 eosinophils were present in the luminal compartment of the early-stage polyp, forming a cap over the central pseudocyst area. Fibronectin deposition was noticed around the eosinophils in the luminal compartment of the early-stage polyp and formed a network-like structure in the polyp center and within the pseudocysts. The presence of myofibroblasts was limited to the central pseudocyst area. Interestingly, albumin and probably other plasma proteins were deposited within the pseudocysts adjacent to the eosinophil infiltration. These observations suggest a central deposition of plasma proteins, regulated by the subepithelial eosinophilic inflammation, as a pathogenic principle of polyp formation and growth. The extravasated plasma, for reasons of distance, binding force, or extracellular matrix damage or abnormality, might not find its way to the airway surface. 178 For additional discussion of the significance of polypoid versus nonpolypoid CRS, see the section below on controversy 1 (p. S181).",

Unfortunately, although other evidence presented in this conference would suggest that there might be infectious and noninfectious-inflammatory subtypes of CRS, there is a general lack of information to support or refute this on histologic grounds. This is an important area in need of further study. Most of what we know about the pathology of NPs comes from studies of inflammatory NPs; that is, those that would best fit the description of edematous, eosinophilic type NPs but might include some NPs with neutrophilic or mixed inflammation cells. Initial studies found heterogeneity in the appearance of NPs, despite the fact that all subjects had symptoms of CRS for a minimum of 12 weeks in association with a history of bilateral NPs and mucosal thickening on sinus CT scans. 179 Likewise, other studies have reported heterogeneity in the histologic appearance of NPs. 174, 175 The pathologic significance of this heterogeneity is unclear but should be kept in mind when interpreting data from NP studies.",

Mast cells can be detected in both the epithelium and the stroma of NPs, as also seen in the nasal mucosa of patients with allergic rhinitis. By contrast to that in the allergic nasal mucosa, the majority of degranulated mast cells are localized to the deep stroma, suggesting that mast cells in NPs are not likely to be activated by inhalant allergens. These mast cells express a variety of cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-13, GM-CSF, TNF-b, and IL-8, and mast cell mediators, such as histamine and tryptase. IL-4 and IL-13 are capable of upregulating the release of RANTES, GM-CSF, stem cell factor, and thymus and activation-regulated chemokine from NP epithelial cells, fibroblasts, or both, indicating a vicious cycle perpetuating the eosinophilic inflammation. In fact, it was recently observed that there are increased levels of tryptase and ECP in recurrent NPs compared with levels found in fresh untreated NPs. 190 Also, a good correlation was detected between the levels of ECP and tryptase. These findings are further supported by the observations of Di Lorenzo et al 198 that the levels of tryptase and ECP in nasal lavage samples of patients with NPs correlated with symptom scores. Furthermore, histamine from mast cells can upregulate the production of fibronectin and chymase, and tryptase can upregulate the production of MMP-9. 190 Because mast cells can be stimulated in a variety of ways other than conventional allergy, (eg, bacteria, virus, fungi, complement, or autoantibodies), mast cells might contribute to the induction of eosinophilic inflammation through the release of various inflammatory mediators and indirectly through the activation of structural cells, thus contributing to the formation and progression of NPs.

A. In allergic subjects with CRSwNP, the presence of the complete T H 2 profile of cytokines suggests that late-phase allergic inflammation might contribute to the disease. However, on the basis of studies of Adkins et al, 209 it is doubtful that airborne allergens penetrate into sinus cavities. This leaves open the question as to how the late-phase inflammatory process is driven in the sinuses. The answer might lie in systemic cross-talk of allergic inflammation (ie, the ability of allergen-induced inflammation at one site to induce a similar response at a remote site). This type of interaction has been demonstrated between the nose and the lungs, [210] [211] [212] and preliminary studies suggest that a similar interaction might occur between the nose and the sinuses. 213 Increased levels of IgE receptor (FceRI) expression were detected in NPs from atopic subjects, and the functional relevance of this could be to cause an increase in IgE-dependent histamine release from NP mast cells. 183, 190 In these patients the levels of specific IgE have been found to be higher in the NP tissue compared with that found in the serum of the same patients, indicating local IgE synthesis. 190 ",

            "text": "CRSwNP are very preliminary, but evidence suggests that peripheral blood T lymphocytes from patients with CRS proliferate and produce IL-5, IL-13, and IFN-g in response to fungal antigens, particularly those from the dematacious fungi Alternaria and Candida species (see section ''Non-IgE-mediated eosinophilic fungal inflammation''). 104 This cytokine profile matches that found in NP tissues or T lymphocytes isolated from NP, therefore supporting the concept that this might be an important immune response pattern in CRSwNP. However, this response profile is not specific for fungi and can also be seen in response to superantigens. 214 C. Bacterial infection might also be associated with IgE sensitization and increase in bacteria-specific IgE and a shift to a T H 2-type cytokine profile. 215 In fact, Bachert et al 13 detected specific IgE to staphylococcal enterotoxins A and B in NPs and found that the levels of IgE correlated with the eosinophilic infiltration. They demonstrated multiclonal IgE, including specific IgE to staphylococcal enterotoxin A and staphylococcal enterotoxin B in 50% of bilateral eosinophilic NPs. Similar levels of superantigenspecific IgE were found in atopic and nonatopic subjects, suggesting a potential common inflammatory response in these 2 groups. Most of these subjects also had asthma. Because IgE can upregulate mast cell FceRI expression and mast cell activation, these observations further suggest a role for mast cells in regulating the chronic eosinophilic inflammation. D. Holtzman et al 216 described a mechanism of T-cell transmigration through the epithelium that involves ICAM-1 and the C-C chemokine RANTES. They proposed that the epithelium in asthma is ''constitutively dysregulated'' (ie, expressing ICAM-1 and producing RANTES independent of exogenous stimuli). This dysregulation does not appear to be associated with increased nuclear factor kB activation in the airway epithelium. The functional consequence of these actions is to facilitate T-lymphocyte migration through the epithelial compartment. They further showed that this dysregulation involves overactivity of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and does not require the presence of IFN-g. 217 Given the many similar inflammatory features of asthma and CRSwNP, it is possible that a similar type of dysregulation is present in CRSwNP.",

Furthermore, an imbalance of MMPs with an upregulation of MMP-7 and MMP-9 in CRSwNP has been found, whereas in CRSsNP MMP-9 and TIMP-1, a natural antagonist, are increased. 218 This results in the enhancement of MMP-9 in CRSwNP, whereas in CRSsNP MMP-9 activity is inhibited. 219 Differences in TGF-b1 and metalloproteinase levels might account for edema formation with albumin retention in CRSwNP versus fibrosis in CRSsNP.",

This might be the case, for instance, in a drug study in which the putative action of the drug might be to prevent the recurrence of NPs.

Other manifestations of polypoid tissue on the nasal turbinates or in the sinus cavities have unclear significance and do not satisfy the criteria for NPs.

However, there is an increasing appreciation of the complexity of this disorder and acknowledgement that persistent inflammation is usually present in CRSsNP, frequently including some degree of tissue eosinophil infiltration. 220 Glandular dysfunction might also play an important role in the pathogenesis of CRSsNP, as suggested by Malekzadeh et al. 164 The phenotype of CRS also appears to affect prognosis after surgical or medical intervention. Using a rhinoscopic grading system, Kennedy et al 108 found that patients with advanced mucosal polypoid changes preoperatively had a much higher rate of recurrence of disease and relapse after endoscopic surgery.

Within the category of eosinophilic CRS would fall classic AFRS; eosinophilic inflammation without fungal hyphae (also described as eosinophilic mucin rhinosinusitis by Ferguson 222 ); aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease consisting of NPs-CRS, asthma, and aspirin sensitivity; and eosinophilic granuloma. In terms of the classification scheme in Fig 8, nearly all cases of CRSwNP and a subset of cases of CRSsNP would fall into the category of eosinophilic inflammation. Eosinophilic diseases limited predominantly to the nasal cavity are worth mentioning because of their strong association and potential overlap with rhinosinusitis. These include allergic rhinitis, nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome, and blood eosinophilia with nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome. Obviously, the finding of nasal and sinus eosinophilia is the common element that groups these very diverse and distinct pathogenic syndromes into a single classification that can then be further delineated by other findings, such as the presence of atopy, mucosal edema (polyposis), and fungal hyphae.",

In contrast, the pathologic processes believed to be most likely in CRS without eosinophilic inflammation are those that impair local or systemic immunity (innate or acquired), mucociliary clearance, or sinus ventilation.",

            "text": "The recent hypothesis of Ponikau et al 8 to describe CRS as eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis or eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis was discussed. This hypothesis was based on the finding of fungal hyphae in association with degranulating eosinophils in the sinus mucus of 93% of patients with CRS, regardless of the presence or absence of allergy, NPs, or other classic features of AFRS. The authors proposed that eosinophilic fungal rhinosinusitis accounts for the vast majority of cases of CRS. Their proposal has stimulated a great deal of controversy. One contentious issue pertains to the prevalence of finding fungal hyphae in sinus mucus and what level of hyphae would be considered abnormal. Using greatly refined mucus collection and staining methods, Ponikau et al 8 found fungal hyphae in the mucus of nearly all patients with CRS. Confirmatory results were recently published from Graz, Austria, by using similar methods of mucus handling and histologic staining for fungal hyphae. 223 The apparent differences between the findings of Ponikau et al 8 and those of earlier reports might be due to the different techniques used for mucus handling and fungal staining, but because this has been a controversial issue, it will be helpful to have additional studies to confirm Ponikau et al's observations. Part of the controversy seems to stem from the fact that an inflammatory process stimulated by fungal hyphae had previously been implicated in only a small subset of cases defined as AFRS. The Ponikau et al proposal to redefine CRS as AFRS seems to dismiss the importance of defining a small subset of cases as AFRS. However, the consensus opinion expressed at the conference was that the term classic AFRS should be retained as the name for the condition classically described as having distinct immunologic, allergic, clinical, and histologic features (see previous discussion of these features). If the Ponikau hypothesis is ultimately widely accepted, the subgroup of patients with classic AFRS are still likely to represent a distinct clinical subset based on these distinctive features. 224 Given the emerging data from the Ponikau group, it is clear that the role of fungi in CRS pathogenesis could assume much greater importance than was previously ascribed to it on the basis of studies of classic AFRS.",

The distinction between factors that are directly evident in the disease versus factors that underlie the disease is somewhat arbitrary but was viewed as the most practical means for classifying CRS. Important distinguishing features in the scheme are (1) controversial, but bacterial infection is regarded as a potentially important factor in both CRSsNP and CRSwNP. Similarly, other underlying or predisposing factors to the disease, such as mucus recirculation, humoral immune deficiency, abnormal mucociliary function, and allergic rhinitis, are extremely important and are listed. Anatomic abnormalities have anecdotally been listed as a predisposing factor for rhinosinusitis, but existing studies do not support this role. An important question arising from the classification scheme is how strongly are certain factors, such as bacterial infection, associated with either CRSsNP or CRSwNP. At present, it is not possible to provide definitive answers to this question. Precise classification of a patient in terms of inflammatory features, namely as having eosinophilic or other inflammatory features, requires evaluation of sinus tissue and sinus mucus. In cases in which this information is unavailable, the minimal clinical classification will be either CRSsNP or CRSwNP.

Several classifications of relevant symptoms have been proposed. 12, 226 The first, developed at a meeting sponsored by the AAAAI, lists symptoms associated with ''acute bacterial rhinosinusitis'' (Table VIII) . Another classification was developed through the Task Force on Rhinosinusitis, sponsored by the AAO-HNS. This one is less specific for the etiology of the rhinosinusitis (Table IX) . Like the earlier list, symptoms are divided into major and minor groups. However, it is not clear whether these categories were based on the prevalence rates, the severity degree, or the specificity of the symptoms. Additional lists have been generated. These do not necessarily divide symptoms into major and minor categories. 227 Some suggest symptoms such as facial erythema and maxillary toothache have high specificity but low sensitivity in the diagnosis of acute community-acquired bacterial rhinosinusitis. 228, 229 Others state the same symptoms are seen with both acute rhinosinusitis and CRS, although they might be more vague in patients whose symptoms have persisted for a longer time. 157 Although a single symptom or sign might have only fair sensitivity-specificity, the combination of symptoms has very good predictive value.",

Patients with tension headaches often believe they have rhinosinusitis because their pain is localized in the forehead and relief is obtained from over-the-counter sinus medications. Migraine headache is an idiopathic recurring disorder with attacks that last approximately 4 to 72 hours. Characteristic of migraine are unilateral location, pulsating quality, moderate-to-severe intensity, associated nausea, and phonophobia or photophobia. 231 Some of the distinctive features of migraine with aura are the complex neurologic symptoms that develop before the onset of the acute headache.

This will help define the magnitude of a patient's disease and allow for more refined assessments of interventions.

The most common symptom scoring range in clinical trials of upper respiratory diseases has 4 options: 0, none; 1, mild; 2, moderate; and 3, severe. 227 A 6-point Likert scale would range as follows: 0, none-absent; 1, very mild; 2, mild; 3, moderate; 4, severe; and 5, very severe. This scale has been used to identify which symptoms are typically the most problematic for patients with CRS (Table XI) . 230 Another scoring system option is a visual analogue scale that ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 100 (maximum severity). The Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters (representing the AAAAI; the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; and the Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology) has developed a method for assessing severity of symptoms of allergic rhinitis. It includes an assessment of nasal symptom severity, an assessment of nonnasal symptom severity, a global assessment of nasal and nonnasal symptom severity, an assessment of QOL issues related to allergic rhinitis, and the effectiveness and adverse profile of current and past rhinitis medications. 232 This method for severity assessment of allergic rhinitis symptoms still requires internal and external validation. Nonetheless, it appears to have potential for both assessing patient management and facilitating clinical research. In addition, by using this method as a guideline, a variation of it can be suggested and could be adapted for evaluating rhinosinusitis. Although patients might characterize the severity of rhinosinusitis as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of one dominating symptom, there is often a mixed degree of severity of the individual symptoms that comprise the full clinical picture.",

            "text": "d There are several validated rhinosinusitis outcome measures, and the instrument that seems best suited for the particular research question should be selected. QOL is a very important consideration in the evaluation of the severity of rhinosinusitis. QOL measurements reflect the effect symptoms have on the patient's daily life. Outcomes research studies the effects of diverse therapies on patient outcome and is increasingly recognized by physicians, third-party payers, and the federal government as crucial for the demonstration of treatment effectiveness and the establishment of patient care guidelines. 236, 237 One of the key features of outcomes research is the expanded definition of outcome. The new outcomes measures used in outcomes research include patient-based measures of symptoms, functional status, social and emotional consequences of disease and treatment, and satisfaction with care. Outcomes research refers to the degree of change of the physical, mental, emotional, or social states of being. 237, 238 Generally, outcomes refers to the outcomes of an intervention and the change in these states associated with a treatment or intervention. 239 Outcomes can also change without intervention. Outcome measures can focus on the traditional hard biologic measures, such as blood pressure and laboratory values, or soft measures, such as pain and functional limitations. 240 Health-related QOL assessment refers to the description of health and disability from the individual's perspective. [241] [242] [243] QOL instruments generally include measures of physical and emotional impairment, functional disability, and handicap. 244, 245 Over the last 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in the use of QOL instruments and the reporting of QOL outcomes. Unfortunately, not all results with QOL instruments are easy to understand or can be integrated into the clinical care of patients.",

The 2 leading methods of objective assessment are nasal endoscopy and sinus imaging with CT.

Nasal endoscopy helps identify erythema, edema, polyps or polypoid swelling, crusting, eosinophilic mucin, and mucopus or frank pus deep in the nasal cavity.

They differ mainly in terms of patient tolerance and safety. With regard to patient comfort and direct access to sinus cavities, flexible endoscopy is generally superior to rigid endoscopy. However, image clarity, the facility to obtain cultures and sample tissues, the ability to control epistaxis, and the ability to perform surgery is superior with rigid endoscopy. Photo documentation of an endoscopic evaluation (photoendoscopy) has been used by some as a research tool. Despite a difference in patient comfort, even rigid nasal endoscopy can be well tolerated. This is evidenced by unpublished data collected during an evaluation of the microbiology of the nasal cavities in 20 healthy medical students. 259 The subjects underwent topical decongestion and anesthesia followed by rigid nasal endoscopy and were asked to rate their overall experience with rigid nasal endoscopy before culture sampling on a 1-to 5-point scale. On average, the subjects rated the experience between tolerable and mildly uncomfortable (2.5). 259 Although it is generally a very safe and well-tolerated procedure, the most common adverse effects of endoscopy are patient discomfort-pain, epistaxis, and vasovagal events. With regard to patient comfort during endoscopy, it is worth noting that there appears to be decreased sensitivity in the nasal passageways of patients with nasal polyps. [260] [261] [262] This, in part, might be explained by data that suggest that substance P levels are depleted in polyp tissues. This information also helps support the fact that patients can be an unreliable gauge of their own disease. Severe and very rare complications have been reported, albeit rarely, with office endoscopy, including orbital hematoma and death (associated with suctioning near the carotid artery).",

There are 2 nonendoscopic approaches to the maxillary sinus, either through the canine fossa or the inferior meatus.

This quantitative definition increases the probability that organisms recovered from the maxillary sinus aspirate truly represent in situ infection and not contamination. In fact, most sinus aspirates from infected sinuses are associated with colony counts in excess of 10 4 cfu/mL. If quantitative cultures cannot be performed, Gram staining of aspirated specimens affords semiquantitative data. If bacteria are readily apparent on a Gram stain, the approximate bacterial density is 10 5 cfu/mL. Of 12 cases in which an antral puncture showed at least 10 5 cfu/mL pathogens, the Gram stain demonstrated either organisms or white blood cells in all 12 and organisms and white blood cells in 9 of 12. 264 The Gram stain is especially helpful if bacteria are seen on smear and the specimen fails to grow with standard aerobic culture techniques, in which case anaerobic organisms or other fastidious bacteria, such as a bacterial biofilm or an antibiotic-suppressed infection, should be suspected. Performance of a Gram stain will also permit an assessment of the local inflammatory response. The presence of many white blood cells in association with a positive bacterial culture in high density makes it likely that a bacterial infection is present. A Gram stain does not easily differentiate neutrophils from eosinophils, and therefore an eosinophil-rich smear with bacteria would be interpreted as showing many white blood cells by many laboratories. Alternatively, a paucity or absence of white blood cells in association with the presence of a positive culture in low density suggests that the bacteria are contaminating the culture rather than causing infection. b. Endoscopic specimens. Recently, there has been interest in obtaining cultures of the middle meatus endoscopically as a surrogate for cultures from a sinus aspirate. The endoscopically obtained culture is less invasive and associated with less morbidity. 264 Unfortunately, in healthy children the middle meatus has been shown to be colonized with the same bacterial species, S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis, as are commonly recovered from children with sinus infection. 268 Accordingly, this technique is controversial because of the potential for misinterpretation in children.",

Several studies in adults have shown a good correlation between cultures of the middle meatus and the sinus aspirate in patients with acute sinusitis, especially when purulence is seen in the middle meatus 164, 264, 270 ; however, other studies have not. 271, 272 CNS is usually interpreted as a nonpathogen in acute sinusitis. Talbot et al 264 correlated the results of endoscopically obtained cultures and cultures obtained from maxillary sinus aspirates. They reported no situations in which the puncture demonstrated CNS of greater than 10 5 cfu/mL; however, a swab of the middle meatus grew CNS in 6 of 53 patients. Interpretation of the pathogenicity of S aureus is more difficult. Two of 53 patients had greater than 10 5 cfu/mL, which correlated with the endoscopic swab. However, in an additional 6 patients, there was no agreement between sites. 264 In rare instances neither a sinus aspirate nor a specimen obtained endoscopically is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus infection. In these instances, biopsy of the sinus mucosa and broth culture and appropriate stains might be required to ascertain the microbiology.",

Subjects were treated with loratadine or placebo for 7 days and then underwent a nasal challenge with histamine. Twenty-four hours later, while receiving the medication, a catheter was placed in the sinus cavity, and the subjects underwent a sinus challenge with histamine. Not surprisingly, in patients receiving placebo, nasal challenge with histamine led to increasing vascular leak indicated by increasing levels of albumin in nasal lavage specimens. When treated with loratadine, an H 1 antihistamine, the effect of histamine challenge was blocked. Although a similar effect was noted in the sinus challenge, the sinus mucosa was 10 times less sensitive to histamine compared with the nasal mucosa. A contralateral response, indicative of a nasonasal reflex, was also evaluated. Although the nasal challenge produced a significant reflex, no effect was noted with sinus challenges. This study showed the feasibility of challenging a sinus directly and suggested differences between the response of the sinus and nasal mucosa to the same stimulus.",

Pelikan and Pelikan-Filipek 289 conducted 73 nasal challenges with antigen in 37 patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis. This resulted in 41 positive nasal responses (in 29 patients), as measured by using rhinometry. Interestingly, 32 of the 41 challenges showed an increase in mucosal edema or opacification of the maxillary sinuses on plain radiographs. They concluded that there was a role of nasal allergy in some patients with chronic maxillary sinusitis. In another study, Baroody et al 213 evaluated the effect of antigen challenge in the nose on inflammation within the sinus. Using a Sinojet (Atos Medical, distributed by Bivona Medical Technologies, Gary, Ind), an instrument used to obtain sinus lavage fluid from the maxillary sinus, they found that nasal allergen challenge induced an eosinophilic sinus mucosal response that was not seen with control challenge. In another study subjects were challenged to assess the effects of nasal allergen challenge on the ipsilateral versus the contralateral sinus. Although eosinophils were present on both sides, the number of eosinophils was significantly less on the contralateral side. 290 A significant increase in maxillary sinus eosinophils was also found during the allergy season compared with that seen in patients out of season, confirming the findings of the nasal challenge studies. 291 Overall, these results suggest that sinus inflammation occurs after nasal allergen challenge.",

For instance, nasal challenge with lysine-aspirin has been used to confirm a history of aspirin sensitivity. 292 Nasal challenges have also been used to confirm allergy, to assess nasal threshold responses, and to study the inflammatory cells and cytokines involved in allergic inflammation.

The premise of this model is that the chronic allergic respiratory syndrome has a spectrum of severity. At the low end, its manifestations are clinically evident in the form of rhinitis, and at the high end, manifestations include asthma and possibly rhinosinusitis. The reason why the nose is in the center of the syndrome is because it constitutes the primary deposition site for aeroallergens. In the presence of rhinitis alone, the lack of clinical manifestations of the syndrome in the lower airways and the paranasal sinuses should not be interpreted as a lack of involvement. The lower airways of individuals who only have allergic rhinitis have been repeatedly found to be inflamed or even remodeled (increased thickness of the reticular basement membrane) compared with those of healthy control subjects. 294 Also, lower airway hyperresponsiveness can be detected in a significant number of individuals with allergic rhinitis but without lower airway symptoms. 295 Several observations support the aforementioned model. First, both allergic rhinitis and nonallergic rhinitis are risk factors for asthma in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. [296] [297] [298] [299] Second, rhinitis is almost ubiquitous in asthma. 298, 300 Furthermore, the nasal mucosa of patients with asthma shows evidence of inflammation, even in the absence of nasal symptoms. 301 Third, the rhinitis of asthmatic patients tends to be more severe than the rhinitis of nonasthmatic patients. Although this concept has not been adequately investigated and the available data are still in preliminary form, 30, 302 recent epidemiologic evidence provides some support for this theory. 299 Finally, data from pathologic and clinicoepidemiologic studies suggests that in asthmatic patients the severity of asthma and rhinitis tracks in parallel. 303, [304] [305] [306] [307] [308] [309] An additional aspect of the relationship between nasal and lower airway disease in the context of the chronic allergic respiratory syndrome is that events that take place in the nasal cavities might affect the lower airways. A nasal allergic reaction induced by localized provocation, for example, can result in increased responsiveness in the lower airways 310, 311 or even in late reductions in lung function. 312 Inversely, treatment of allergic rhinitis with topical glucosteroids has been shown, in several studies, to improve various asthma outcomes. [313] [314] [315] [316] [317] [318] [319] [320] [321] However, the mechanisms of this apparent interaction between the nasal and the lower airways are not clear. Obviously, many functions of the nose are known to benefit the lower airways, and it would not be surprising if deterioration or improvement of these functions accounted for the interactions. On the other hand, allergic reactions and their inflammatory consequences appear to propagate systemically, and the interactions between nasal and lower airways might represent the manifestations of such a systemic component. [210] [211] [212] The data relating sinus disease to asthma are far less extensive; however, they indicate similar relationships between asthma and rhinosinusitis as between asthma and rhinitis. For example, almost ubiquitous presence of paranasal sinus abnormalities in patients with moderateto-severe asthma has been reported in a study using computed tomography. 322 Because they commonly coexist, testing pulmonary functions in patients with rhinosinusitis should always be considered. Evidence of eosinophilia in the sinus mucosa is stronger in patients with rhinosinusitis and asthma, as opposed to rhinosinusitis alone. 323 Medical and surgical treatment of sinus disease appears to have beneficial effects on asthma outcomes, but the studies reporting such findings are not randomized, and the outcomes are frequently subjective. [324] [325] [326] Thus because the links between the upper and lower airway are not fully understood, additional, careful, mechanistic, and therapeutic studies need to be conducted to further clarify the relationships of rhinosinusitis in these integrated respiratory syndromes.",

For example, studies designed to demonstrate the efficacy of novel antibiotics frequently study subjects with acute symptoms combined with the presence of fluid in the maxillary sinuses as demonstrated on the basis of air-fluid levels on plain radiography or CT scanning. Given regulatory guidelines by which this class of drug is approved, this definition is understandable. However, many patients present with a similar spectrum of acute symptoms and are treated on an empiric basis without confirmatory imaging tests. [160] [161] [162] 328, 329 On review of published clinical trials, it is clear that even for the acute maxillary paradigm listed above, inclusion and exclusion criteria are inconsistent in regard to the demographics of the populations studied, the medications prohibited during any study, and the range of concomitant medications permitted.",

In studies of nonantibiotic drugs for the management of rhinosinusitis, a condition for which there is poor correlation between CT findings and symptoms, CT findings alone can not be used as a surrogate in assessing efficacy. 340, 341 Physicians routinely treat the entities of acute and chronic rhinitis and rhinosinusitis empirically on the basis of symptomatic presentation. [161] [162] [163] 329, 342, 343 In established patients with rhinosinusitis who experience exacerbations, physicians often diagnose and prescribe without physical examination because there is little evidence that physical examination is helpful in establishing the diagnosis in patients who present with typical symptoms of rhinosinusitis. If patients are refractory to therapy or if their symptoms are atypical, a detailed physical examination is generally indicated. In some cases referral to a specialist, with performance of radiographic imaging, flexible or rigid nasal endoscopy, or both, might be appropriate. 344 As experience has evolved with the use of coronal CT imaging of the sinuses, it is now accepted that appropriate timing of a CT scan is crucial. Gwaltney et al 26 showed that positive scans could be demonstrated in acute upper respiratory tract infection. For CRS, a scan taken to demonstrate the extent of residual disease after maximal pharmacotherapy, to define anatomy before surgery, or both is appropriate. 162 There have been several attempts to devise staging systems to define the extent of disease. 345 Most of these have been developed as a guide to surgical staging and have not been validated in the context of assessing the natural history of the disease or in assessing the effect of nonsurgical intervention.",

Until recently, there has been a lack of consensus regarding classification and definition of various types of rhinosinusitis, inability to diagnose rhinosinusitis with high specificity, and varying standards of care; all of these factors make design of an effective clinical study difficult. In many respects acute rhinosinusitis and recurrent rhinosinusitis are easier to study then CRS. The stage was set for further refinement of the definitions of CRS, as proposed in this document through the development of a consensus definition for CRS by the Chronic Rhinosinusitis Task Force of the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership. 352 During an acute rhinosinusitis study, evidence of efficacy depends on the drug itself. For an adjunct therapy, the study needs to show that the combination is better than the regimen to which the experimental agent is added. For a stand-alone nonantibiotic drug, the study needs to show that the experimental medication is better than placebo. For a stand-alone antibiotic drug, the study needs to show that the experimental antimicrobial agent is similar or superior to an approved antibiotic, as well as showing some evidence of bacteriological cure (www.fda.cder/ guidance: Acute Bacterial Sinusitis). For acute bacterial rhinosinusitis studies, clinical outcomes are measured by clinical cure or clinical failure, for example, a 20% difference between an antibiotic and placebo as an outcome at the end of 10 days of therapy. Microbiologic outcomes are described as documented eradication, presumed eradication, documented persistence, or presumed persistence. During a recurrent rhinosinusitis study, efficacy variables can include time to recurrence (possibly primary variable), severity of recurrence (secondary variable), and frequency of recurrence (secondary variable). Finally, it is important to determine that end points used to assess efficacy should be carefully selected to avoid confounding factors. Investigators need to define the clinically significant difference for a particular study. The ways to define clinically significant difference include a distribution-based approach with a standardized response mean and effect size and the preferred anchorbased approach, using global ratings of change.",

Therefore the use of the term rhinosinusitis more accurately describes the spectrum of infectious and inflammatory conditions previously grouped under the term sinusitis. The group agreed to endorse and adopt the previously developed definition of the Sinus and Allergy Health Partnership Task Force with the following definition for rhinosinusitis: ''Rhinosinusitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the mucosa of the nose and the paranasal sinuses.'' 352 Although the participants recognize the advantages in using the term rhinosinusitis rather than sinusitis, the committee also wants to emphasize that the term rhinosinusitis is not intended to be confused with or replace the term rhinitis, which refers to the various diseases primarily, but not exclusively, confined to the nose. It is important to maintain the distinction between rhinosinusitis and rhinitis both diagnostically and therapeutically, even though the conditions might have overlapping symptoms and signs. For instance, although the use of an antibiotic might be very appropriate for a case of acute rhinosinusitis, it would be unusual for a rhinopathy. Health care professionals are keenly aware of the problem of overuse of antibiotics for upper respiratory tract infections and are committed to adding greater precision to the diagnosis of both acute rhinosinusitis and CRS.

Individual symptoms that should be included in outcomes monitoring are drainage (anterior or posterior), nasal obstruction, facial pain-pressure-fullness, diminished sense of smell, headache, ear pain-pressure, halitosis, dental pain-pressure, cough, fatigue, fever, and sleep disturbance. Individual symptoms should be rated on a set scale. Global symptom severity should also be rated as outlined previously. A validated QOL measurement should be performed to monitor progress. Optional recommended instruments include SF-36, SNOT-20, and RSDI. Although a standardized QOL assessment should be included, the group did not reach a consensus on any one specific instrument.",
