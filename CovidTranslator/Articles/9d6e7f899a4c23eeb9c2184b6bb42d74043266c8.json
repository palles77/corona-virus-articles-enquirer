Compared to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 about which 90% Australian Hajj pilgrims were aware (Alqahtani et al., 2015b) , fewer pilgrims were aware of MERS-CoV. The Ebola outbreak severity with consequent wider media coverage probably played a role in increasing awareness.

This contrasts with the findings of Gautret et al. who showed that only 14% French pilgrims knew about the disease risk from drinking raw camel milk but 40% of them were willing to drink camel milk if offered during Hajj (Gautret et al., 2013a) , indicating that pilgrims' awareness influenced their attitude. A unique finding to emerge from our study was that departing pilgrims with knowledge about MERS-CoV were significantly more aware of the risk of drinking raw camel milk (43% vs. 23%, P < 0.01), yet a considerable proportions of them were willingness to drink raw milk and visit camel farms (respectively 15% and 23%). This possibly indicates that despite being aware of MERS-CoV epidemic in Saudi Arabia, some individuals were not fully informed about the high risk behaviors (Al-Mohrej et al., 2015) . This could be addressed by public awareness campaigns. Providing direct health education to Hajj pilgrims at entry points (e.g. airport) in Saudi Arabia could improve their understanding about the possible modes of transmission of MERS-CoV and how to avoid exposure risks (Turkestani et al., 2013) .",

An iPhone appbased small survey conducted parallel to this survey revealed that 16% of international Hajj pilgrims reported contact with camels during Hajj (Alqahtani et al., 2015a) . Consumption of raw camel products (milk, liver, meat, or urine) can lead to outbreaks of other infections such as brucellosis, plague, and rift valley fever (Bin Saeed et al., 2005; Davies, 2006; Kalimuddin et al., 2010) .
