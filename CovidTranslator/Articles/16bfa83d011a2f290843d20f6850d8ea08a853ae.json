            "text": "In the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, some unique clinical features have been described [1] . In a report of 44,672 cases from China, a case fatality rate of 2.8% for males versus only 1.7% for females was observed [2] . It has been hypothesized that this may be due a higher prevalence of comorbidities among males, in particular the rate of smoking, which is reported to be 52.1% in men and 2.7% among women in China [3] . However, decreased levels of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the reported host receptor of the virus responsible of COVID-19 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2), are observed in smokers [4, 5] . In this article, we aimed to investigate the association between active smoking and severity of COVID-19 illness.",

Therefore, 5 studies could finally be included in our meta-analysis, totaling 1399 COVID-19 patients, 288 of whom (20.6%) with severe disease [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . The essential characteristics of the five included studies are shown in Table 1 , whilst the individual and pooled OR of smoking for predicting severe COVID-19 is shown in Fig. 1 . Overall, in only one study [8] active smoking was found to be a significant predictor of COVID-19 severity, whilst in the other four studies the association was not statistically significant. Despite a trend towards higher risk was appreciable, no significant association could neither be found between active smoking and severity of COVID-19 when data of individual studies were pooled (OR, In conclusion, the results of this preliminary meta-analysis based on Chinese patients suggest that active smoking does not apparently seem to be signicantly associated with enhanced risk of progressing towards severe disease in COVID-19.",
