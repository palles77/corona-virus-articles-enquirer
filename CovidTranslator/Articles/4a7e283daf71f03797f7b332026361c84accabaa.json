            "text": "The impact on the host of microbial damage depends very much on the tissue involved. Damage to muscle in the shoulder or stomach wall, for instance, may not be serious, but in the heart the very existence of the host depends on a strong muscle contraction continuing to occur every second or so, and here the effect of minor functional changes may be catastrophic. The central nervous system (CNS) is particularly vulnerable to slight damage. The passage of nerve impulses requires normal function in the neuronal cell membrane, and viruses especially have important effects on cell membranes. Also a degree of cellular or tissue oedema that is tolerable in most tissues may have serious consequences if it occurs in the brain, enclosed in that more or less rigid box, the skull. Therefore, encephalitis and meningitis tend to cause more severe illness than might be expected from the histological changes themselves. Oedema is a serious matter also in the lung. Oedema fluid or inflammatory cell exudates appear first in the space between the alveolar capillary and the alveolar wall, decreasing the efficiency of gaseous exchanges. Respiratory function is more drastically impaired when fluid or cells accumulate in the alveolar air space.* The effect of tissue damage is much less in the case of organs, such as the liver, pancreas or kidney, which have considerable functional reserves. More * In the normal lung, bronchioles and alveoli have an immense capacity to absorb surplus fluid, as indicated by the observation that 21 litres of fluid can be given intratracheally to a horse over the course of 3.5 h with no ill effect. There are nearly 10 9 alveoli in man, richly supplied with lymphatics, and with a combined absorptive area of 90 m 2. than two-thirds of the liver must be removed before there are signs of liver dysfunction.",

The resulting circulatory changes may lead to anoxia or necrosis in the tissues supplied by these vessels. Here too, the site of vascular lesions may be critical, effects on organs such as the brain or heart having a greater impact on the host, as discussed above. Rickettsiae characteristically grow in vascular endothelium and this is an important mechanism of disease production. By a combination of direct and immunopathological factors there is endothelial swelling, thrombosis, infarcts, haemorrhage and tissue anoxia. This is especially notable in the skin, and forms the basis for the striking rashes in typhus and the spotted fevers. These skin rashes, although important for the physician, are less important for the patient than similar lesions in the central nervous system or heart. It is damage to cerebral vessels that accounts for the cerebral disturbances in typhus; involvement of pulmonary vessels causes pneumonitis, and involvement of myocardial vessels causes myocardial oedema. In Q fever, rickettsiae sometimes localise in the endocardium, and this causes serious complications.",

            "text": "There are many diseases of unknown aetiology for which an infectious origin has been suggested. Sometimes it is fairly well established that an infectious agent can at least be one of the causes of the disease, but in most instances it is no more than a hypothesis, with little or no good evidence. For conditions as common and as serious as multiple sclerosis, cancer and rheumatoid arthritis it would be of immense importance if a microorganism were incriminated, since this would give the opportunity to prevent the disease by vaccination. Accordingly, there is a temptation to accept or publicise new reports even though the evidence is weak or the observations poorly controlled. As if to warn us about this and remind us of possibilities from environmental toxins, Parkinson's disease, a chronic neurological condition in which there is a loss of neurons in a sharply defined region of the brain (substantia nigra), can be caused by exposure to the chemical MPTP. One example which raises the possibility that subtle CNS disturbances may be caused by viruses is experimental infection with Borna disease virus. This virus was used to infect tree shrews (Tupaia glis) which are primitive primates. There is little overt disease, but afterwards the male is no longer able to enact the ritual courtship behaviour, which (as students well know), is an essential preliminary to mating in all primates, and the frustrated male usually ends up bitten by the female. Thus it can be said that infection with Borna disease virus renders the male psychologically sterile. Presumably the virus in some way alters the functioning of neurons concerned in this particular pathway. All other behavioural and physiological aspects appear normal. Borna disease virus is not known to occur in man, but speculation about an analogous human situation is fuelled by the finding of Borna disease virus-specific antibodies in patients with psychiatric/ behavioural disorders. In an entirely different clinical context, infection of a particular strain of rats with Borna disease virus causes immense obesity, the underlying physiological basis of which is not understood. Since the aetiology of such diseases raises interesting problems in pathogenesis, the present state of affairs is summarised in Table 8 .1, which includes some of the human diseases whose infectious origin is probable, possible, conceivable, or inconceivable.",

            "text": "Causal connections between infection and disease states are particularly difficult to establish when the disease appears a long time after infection. It was not too difficult to prove and accept that the encephalitis that occasionally occurs during or immediately after measles was due to measles virus. But it was hard to accept that a very rare type of encephalitis (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis or SSPE), occurring up to 10 years after apparently complete recovery from measles, was also due to measles virus and this was only established after careful studies and the eventual difficult isolation of a mutant form of measles virus from brain cells. 'Slow' infections, in which the first signs of disease appear a long time after infection, are now an accepted part of our outlook. The disease kuru occurred in New Guinea and was transmitted from person to person by cannibalism. The incubation period in man appears to be 12-15 years, and the disease was caused by an unconventional infectious agent that grew in the brain. This was established when the same disease appeared in monkeys several years after the injection of material from the brain of Kuru patients (see pp. 351-353) . A similar agent called scrapie (see Ch. 7) infects sheep, mice and other animals and also has an incubation period representing a large portion of the life span of the host. In both Kuru and SSPE the agent was eventually shown to be present in the brains of patients. So far this has only been demonstrated indirectly as, despite strenuous efforts, the causative agent has yet to be isolated. If in a slow infection, the microorganism that initiated the pathological process is no longer present by the time the disease becomes manifest, then the problem of establishing a causal relationship will be much greater. This may possibly turn out to be true for diseases like multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. Liver cancer in humans and certain leukaemias in mice, cats, humans and cattle can be caused by slowtype virus infections. Cancer or leukaemia appears as a late and occa- sional sequel to infection. The virus, its antigens or fragments of its nucleic acid are detectable in malignant cells.",

But one of the earliest indications of illness is malaise, 'not feeling very well'. This is distinct from fever or a specific complaint such as a sore throat and, although it is difficult to define and impossible to measure, we all know the feeling. It can precede the onset of more specific signs and symptoms, or accompany them. Sometimes it is the only indication that an infection is taking place. Almost nothing is known of the basis for this feeling. 'Toxins', of course, have been invoked and the earliest response to pyrogens (see pp. 329-331) before body temperature has actually risen, may play a part. Interferons may have something to do with it because pure preparations of human (z or ~ interferons cause malaise and often headaches, and muscle aches after injection into normal individuals. Soluble mediators of immune and inflammatory responses, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1; see Glossary) or other cytokines doubtless also play a part. Several cytokines induce release of prostaglandin E2 which, in addition to its effect on fever, reduces the pain threshold in neurons, and this could account for aches and pains. In some infectious diseases weakness and debility are prominent during convalescence. This can be especially notable following influenza and hepatitis, but its basis is as mysterious as in the case of malaise.",

            "text": "The infections that matter are those causing pathological changes and disease. Before giving an account of the mechanisms by which these changes are produced, it is important to remember that many infectious agents cause little or no damage in the host. Indeed, it is of some advantage to the microorganism to cause minimal host damage, as discussed in Ch. 1. Virus infections as often as not fall into this category. Thus, although infection with rabies or measles viruses nearly always causes disease, there are many enterovirus, reovirus and myxovirus infections that are regularly asymptomatic. Even viruses that are named for their association with disease (poliomyelitis, influenza, Japanese encephalitis) often give an antibody response as the only sign of infection in the host. Tissue damage is too slight to cause detectable illness. There is also a tendency for persistent viruses to cause no more than minor or delayed cellular damage during their persistence in the body, even if the same virus has a more cytopathic effect during an acute infection, e.g. adenoviruses, herpes simplex (see Ch. 10). A few viruses are remarkable because they cause no pathological changes at all in the cell, even during a productive infection in which infectious virus particles are produced. For instance, mouse cells infected with LCM (see Glossary) or leukaemia virus show no pathological changes. A mouse congenitally infected with LCM virus shows a high degree of immune tolerance, and all tissues in the body are infected. Throughout the life of the animal, virus and viral antigens are produced in the cerebellum, liver, retina, etc. without discernible effect on cell function. But sometimes there are important functional changes in infected cells which lead to a pathological result. For example, the virus infects growth-hormone-producing cells in the anterior pituitary. Although the cells appear perfectly healthy, the output of growth hormone is reduced, and as a result of this, suckling mice fail to gain weight normally and are runted.",

Many virus infections result in a shutdown of RNA synthesis (transcription), protein synthesis (translation) and DNA synthesis in the host cell, but usually these are too slow to account for the death of the cell. After all, cells like neurons never synthesise DNA, and the half-life of most proteins and even RNAs is at least several hours. A possible alternative mechanism is the alteration of the differential permeability of the plasma membrane. This is important as the cell has a high internal K \u00a7 concentration and low Na \u00a7 concentration, while the reverse is true of body fluids. Viruses do alter membrane permeability, but the unresolved question is whether or not this is responsible for the death of the cell or whether it is merely an after effect.",

This is the natural process by which the body controls cell numbers and rids itself of superfluous or redundant cells during development. A familiar example is a tadpole 'losing' its tail. Cells do not disintegrate but round up, and are then removed by phagocytes. Apoptosis in virus infections can be regarded as a host strategy for destroying infected cells.* The chromatin condenses round the edge of the nucleus and a cellular endonuclease cleaves the DNA into 180-200 base pair fragments. The cell membrane forms blebs but stays intact while the cell as a whole breaks up into smaller bodies. The suicide process is more controlled, almost more dignified, than mere disintegration and necrosis.

The first are inclusion bodies, parts of the cell with altered staining behaviour which develop during infection. They often represent either cell organelles or virus factories in which viral proteins and/or nucleic acids are being synthesised and assembled. Herpes group viruses form intranuclear inclusions, rabies and poxviruses intracytoplasmic inclusions, and measles virus both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusions. The second characteristic morphological change caused by viruses is the formation of multinucleate giant cells. This occurs, for instance when human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 'fusion' proteins (gpl20-gp41) present in nascent virus particles budding from an infected cell attach to CD4 receptors in the plasma membranes of neighbouring cells; membranes then fuse and multinucleate cells are formed.

As the single cycle of growth in hepatic cells is completed, massive liver necrosis takes place, and mice die only 6 h after initial infection. The host defences in the form of local lymph nodes, local tissue phagocytes, etc. are completely overcome by the intravenous route of injection, and by the inability of Kupffer cells to prevent infection of hepatic cells. Direct damage by the replicating virus destroys hepatic cells long before immune or interferon responses have an opportunity to control the infection. This is the summit of virulence.

This view is too embracing, because it includes proteins of doubtful significance in disease, and also too restrictive, because it excludes nonprotein toxic complexes such as endotoxin. Another suggestion is that toxin must include all naturally occurring substances (of plant, animal, bacterial or whatever origin) which, when introduced into a foreign host, are adverse to the wellbeing or life of the victim. This, too, is unsatisfactory because some substances -potent toxins within the scope of this definition-are being used in some contexts as therapeutic agents! Perhaps it is pointless to strive for an all-embracing definition, although the obvious differences between bacterial and fungal toxins warrant the continued use of the appropriate prefix.

An essential virulence factor of H. pylori is a potent urease which is synthesised in vast quantity by the organism, and (at least in culture) released by autolysis and efficiently absorbed on to the surface of viable organisms. As noted in Ch. 2, it is important in local neutralisation of stomach acidity thereby allowing H. pylori to penetrate the protective mucus layer overlying the lining of the stomach where the organism attaches to gastric epithelial cells. However, urease is now considered by some as a toxin which acts outside cells, since NH3, the product of urease activity, is toxic to cells.",

Soon large areas of epidermis become lifted by a layer of serous fluid and peel at the slightest touch. Large areas of the body rapidly become denuded in this way and the symptoms resemble those of massive scalding.

The best example is the ~-toxin of Clostridium perfringens, the organism most commonly associated with gas gangrene. It is strictly anaerobic and occurs as a normal inhabitant in the large intestines of man and animals; its spores are ubiquitous in soil, dust and air. C. perfringens does not multiply in healthy tissues, but grows rapidly when it reaches devitalised and therefore anaerobic tissues. This could be after contamination of a natural wound with soil or dust, particularly on battlefields or in automobile accidents, or after contamination of a surgical operation site with clostridia from the patient's own bowels or skin. After abortions, particularly in the old days before antibiotics, intestinal clostridia often gained access to necrotic or devitalised tissues in the uterus and set up life-threatening infections. Invasion of the blood was common and soon resulted in death, the clostridia localising and growing in internal organs such as the liver after death. C. perfringens has various enzymes that enable it to break down connective tissue materials, including collagen and hyaluronidase, thereby facilitating spread of the infection along tissue planes. Most of these enzymes are toxic to host cells and tissues, but a-toxin is easily the most important one. It is dermonecrotic, haemolytic (a feature seen mainly in tissues close to the focus of infection but sometimes responsible for large-scale intravascular haemolysis in infected patients), causes turbidity in lipoprotein-rich solutions and is lethal. While it is still true that these activities are all due to one molecular species, they are not (as was once thought) different expressions of the one enzymic activity.",

It is of undoubted importance in gas gangrene. Toxoid prepared by formalin-treated toxin will protect sheep against infection caused by C. perfringens. However, one might ask why all enzymes with such biochemical specificity are not equally toxic or important in determining virulence; there are several reasons which can be put forward. We know that there are at least two functional domains in C. perfringens a-toxin. Comparison of C. perfringens a-toxin with the phosphatidyl choline-preferring, nontoxic zincmetallophospholipase of Bacillus cereus, reveals that two-thirds of the N-terminal sequence of C. perfringens (~-toxin shows homology with the entire sequence of B. cereus PLC; this portion of C. perfringens a-toxin retains its PLC activity, but not its haemolytic and lethal activities. The Cterminal part is not haemolytic, not enzymatically active and not cytotoxic for mouse lymphocytes, but is necessary for conferring toxicity on the N-terminal part of the protein. In fact, the C-terminus is a potent immunogen that will solidly protect mice-and hopefully managainst experimental infection with C. perfringens.

While haemolysis does occur in experimental gas gangrene (evidenced by haematuria), there is little evidence of massive haemolysis in naturally occurring cases of gangrene. It is now considered more likely that the basis of toxicity is not cytolysis, but rather the consequence of the ability of the a-toxin, in sublytic doses, to cause profound metabolic changes arising from release of phospholipid derivatives. For example production of inositol triphosphate (IP3), a potent secondary messenger, would affect many cell functions. The activation of the arachidonic acid cascade would result in the production of leukotrienes (increasing vascular permeability), prostaglandins and thromboxanes (causing inflammation, muscle contraction and platelet aggregation). This toxin also upregulates expression of endothelial leucocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and neutrophil chemoattractant-activator IL-8, thereby impairing delivery of phagocytes to the site of infection.",

Recent work requires that we abandon certain perceptions about these toxins which are enshrined in the older nomenclature. For example, purified toxins are not O2-1abile, and are not activated by sulihydryl compounds, and do not depend on a cysteine residue for activity. Alouf has suggested the generic term used as our heading, since the one common feature which correctly applies to all members of this group is the ability of cholesterol to irreversibly inhibit the lytic and lethal properties of these toxins. Interaction with cholesterol is thought to be the key primary event in their interaction with susceptible membranes, which leads to the impairment of the latter; cholesterol plays no further part in the subsequent damage process. However, the role of cholesterol has been interpreted in terms of mediating the oligomerisation process (illustrated in Fig. 8 .2) which leads to membrane damage.

Comparative studies in mice with both wild-type and a pneumolysin-negative mutant (PLN-A) of serotype-2 pneumococci demonstrated that pneumolysin was important in the induction of inflammation in the lung (not cell wall components as had long been believed), conferring ability to replicate in the lung and invade into the bloodstream, and altering alveolar permeability. It inhibits cilial beat in respiratory mucosa. In experimental meningitis in guinea pigs, in contrast to the mouse lung model, PLY was not responsible for the potent inflammatory response, but did cause an increase in protein content of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) presumably reflecting its ability to alter cell barriers.

Two examples are given, Serratia and Proteus cytolysins and staphylococcal leukocidins. Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic pathogen which causes a range of infections including respiratory and urinary tract infections; Proteus mirabilis causes acute pyelonephritis. Pathogenicity is multifactorial but the accumulated evidence is that a membrane-active cytolysin plays an important role in disease causation by both pathogens. S. marcescens haemolysin (ShlA) and P. mirabilis haemolysin (HpmA) represent a new type of cytolytic toxin: they are described as 'cell-associated' and have a specialised means of delivery from the bacterial cell to the target host cell. ShlA and HpmA each require a second protein, ShlB and HpmB, respectively. The B proteins form pores in the bacterial outer membrane facilitating the secretion of the corresponding A components, their concomitant activation and insertion into eukaryotic membranes. These A proteins are also cytotoxic, causing vacuolation in cells and release of a range of inflammatory mediators.",

However, the problems generated by antibiotic-resistant staphylococci has stimulated a great deal of new research on this pathogen arising from which is the recognition that PV leukocidin and y-toxin belong to a very large family of binary leukocidins. Each leukocidin consists of two proteins -S (so called because it elutes slowly) and F (it elutes fast) from an ion-exchange column. S binds first to as yet ill-defined cell receptors (important in defining target cell specificity), followed by F which acts synergistically with S to create functional pores in the target membrane. There are at least six class S proteins and five class F proteins which can give rise to ca. 30 biologically active combinations, a fact which could be highly significant in that some strains produce more than one binary leukocidin. Although various S-F combinations exhibit different target cell specificities, most are active against PMNs. It has been shown that PV, which is highly active against human PMNs, causes release of leukotriene B4, IL-8, histamine and tissue degradative enzymes, which would give rise to the chemotactic invasion of more PMNs and subsequent tissue damage.",

PES is non-toxic when injected into animals or added to cells on its own. This problem has now been resolved. It is a single polypeptide with no receptorbinding component or translocation domain (see below): it is 'injected' directly across cell membranes by a mechanism functionally similar to that already described for the translocation of Tir by E. coli (see Ch. 2, Fig. 2 .7). PES is activated by a cytoplasmic protein FAS, and ADP-ribosylates the small G-protein Ras resulting in the collapse of the cytoskeleton (see Ch. 4; Fig. 4 .1). Also included in this category are the 'phagocyte toxins' injected into phagocytes by Yersinia enterocolitica (Ch. 2) .

After proteolytic cleavage, PA sites are exposed which bind edema factor (EF), thereby facilitating translocation of EF into the cytosol directly from acidified endosomes as described for DTA ( Fig. 8.7 ). EF must be rapidly inactivated since washing toxin-treated cells results in a rapid loss of adenylate cyclase activity. EF interacts with calmodulin (CAL) to become an active adenylate cyclase enzyme in nearly all cells. Interaction of PA with EF and subsequent internalisation of EF is blocked by prior binding of LF. In contrast to EF which is active in many cells, LF protease is only active in macrophages. This model explains the characteristic hypovolaemic shock syndrome ( cAMP is a potent secretagogue), cytotoxicity to macrophages, and the immunogenicity of PA. Fig. 8 .9). The evidence is hardest for ricin, an A-B type toxic plant lectin (believed to have been located in the tip of an umbrella and used to poison a Bulgarian spy!). Newly formed toxin-containing endosomes enter those vesicular trafficking pathways which lead to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), through the Golgi and further into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This is the reverse of the normal secretory pathway and is therefore called 'retrograde transport'. This gives functional significance to the C-terminal sequence lysine-aspartate-glutamate-leucine (the KDEL motif) in the A subunit of cholera toxin and related sequences in LT and PEA. The KDEL motif is normally found in proteins which, having been processed in the Golgi, are returned to and are trapped by the ER which recognises the KDEL motif, thereby preventing such proteins being lost to the cell via exocytotic trafficking. The next part is speculative and described for CT. Either in the TGN or the ER, CTA is reduced freeing CTA1, the CT toxiphore ( Fig. 8 .5). There is another ER pathway, the Sec61p secretion channel, through which aberrantly folded molecules are returned to the cytosol to proteasomes Mode of entry of cholera toxin. This represents a much more complex route to an intracellular target. As described in the text it involves interaction of CTB subunits (shaded part of molecule) with ganglioside receptor GM1 (vertical arrow), receptor-mediated endocytosis, retrograde transport of the endosome to the trans-Golgi network (TGN), through the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and anterograde transport of liberated CTA1 from ER in vesicles directed to the basolateral membrane, the intracellular location of adenyl cyclase. This mechanism is operative at least for several other toxins.",

The schema shows a round of peptide elongation and illustrates the key role played by two enzymes, EF-1 and EF-2. EF-1-GTP interacts with aminoacyl-tRNA; this complex is docked into site A, EF-1-GTP becomes EF-1-GDP and is recycled as shown. After peptidyl transfer, EF-2-GTP catalyses transfer of the extended peptide to site P, and is itself autocatalytically converted to EF-2-GDP. DTA and PEA each ADP-ribosylates diphthamide (a modified histidine) in EF-2-GTP, which can no longer translocate the newly elongated peptide from the A site to the P site. The ShTA fragment is a specific N-glycosidase which cleaves an adenine residue from near the 3' end of the 28S ribosomal RNA.

Muscles are reciprocally innervated with sensory and motor neurons, although for clarity this is shown only for the protagonist muscle. On stretch, the stretch receptors generate an impulse which is transmitted along the afferent sensory (S) neuron of the protagonist (P) muscle. This SP neuron enters the spinal cord by the dorsal root and synapses with the motor neuron supplying the protagonist muscle (MP) and with an interneuron (I) which in turn synapses with the motor neuron supplying the antagonist muscle (MA); the efferent motor neurons leave the spinal cord by the ventral root. At the SP/MP synapse an excitatory transmitter is released which induces an impulse in MP which leads to contraction of protagonist muscle. However, excitation of I causes release of an inhibitory transmitter at the I/MA synapse which leads to relaxation of the antagonist muscle. Note that the basic reflex arc has been shown for simplicity but TeTx acts mainly on voluntary muscles. 2. A simplified version of the biochemical events occurring in synapses (lower left). Excitatory and inhibitory synapses, neurotransmitter release and erythrogenic/pyrogenic toxins A and C* of Streptococcus pyogenes (SPEA, SPEC), staphylococcal enterotoxins (of which there are eight major serotypes, A to I, designated SEA, SEB, etc.) and staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST-1 (human strains) and WSSWovine). These proteins are superantigens by virtue of their ability to bind to major histocompatibility (MHC) class II molecules, outside the antigen-binding grove. They are presented as unprocessed proteins to certain T lymphocytes expressing specific T-cell receptor (TCR) motifs located in the variable domain of the ~-chain (V~) of the TCR (see Chs 6 and 7). Nanogram to picogram quantities of superantigen will stimulate up to 20% of all T cells, compared with only 0.001 to 0.00001% T cells stimulated by conventional presentation of antigen to TCR. As a consequence of this huge proliferation ofT cells and expression/release of aberrantly high levels of cytokines and other mediators, many biological systems are affected causing lethality/shock. This represents an important interference with a coordinated immune response, and the widespread polyclonal activation and cytokine release can be regarded as a microbial strategy, a 'diversion' of host immune defences. Ironically, the superantigen not only expands the circulating T-cell population, but also reacts with developing T cells in the thymus causing the same subpopulation to decline (see Ch. 7). It seems probable that these effects on immune cells represent a more important biological function of these toxins than the one responsible for the characteristics of disease; the latter may be no more than an 'accidental' phenomenon. It turns out that similar molecules are formed by mycoplasma and by certain retroviruses (e.g. the Mls antigen of mouse mammary tumour virus).",

The latter is internalised and upsets the equilibrium between polymerisation and depolymerisation of actin. ADP-ribosylation of actin inhibits its polymerisation and turns G-actin into a capping protein which binds to the fast-growing (concave) ends of actin filaments. Capping of the concave ends increases the critical concentration for actin polymerisation. Since the slow-growing (pointed) ends of actin filaments are free, depolymerisation of actin occurs at these ends. Released actin is substrate for the toxin and will be withdrawn from the treadmilling pool of actin by ADP-ribosylation, i.e. trapped. Both reactions will finally induce the breakdown of the microfilament network. others specific to certain members of this group. The red skin rash elicited by the streptococcal toxins (which gave rise to the original nomenclature 'erythrogenic' toxins) is regarded as a secondary hypersensitive effect, but pyrogenicity is the result of direct action on the h y p o t h a l a m u s as well as release of IL-1 and T N F -a from macrophages. Sensitivity to endotoxin shock can be increased up to 100 000 times in monkeys by SPEA/C and this may be due in part to an ability to impair the reticuloendothelial system which would result in inefficient clearing of circulating endotoxin.* Staphylococci cause food poisoning on a world-wide scale; infection rates are under-reported probably because it is normally a self-limiting gastrointestinal disease. Onset of disease is rapid after consumption of enterotoxin-containing food. The main features of the disease are diarrhoea and severe vomiting, the latter being due to enterotoxin stimulation of the vagus nerve.",

Toxic shock syndrome is characterised by sudden onset of fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, an erythematous rash followed by peeling of the skin, hypotensive shock, impairment of renal and hepatic functions and occasionally death. The main symptoms of the disease have been reproduced in rabbits by implanting chamber-enclosed TSS strains in the rabbit uterus or peritoneum or by injection of TSST-1 into rabbits. Complex changes are observed including haemorrhage in kidney and liver, congestion and haematomas in the lungs, leakage of blood into the thymus, and fluid in the pericardial sac and in the gut lumen. These effects in rabbits are very similar to those seen in humans and would certainly explain the shock and diarrhoeal syndrome so characteristic of the disease.

Another entirely different type of synergistic interaction is that of the increase in toxicities of staphylococcal r and ),-toxins, diphtheria toxin and endotoxin for neonatal ferrets preinfected with influenza virus. Increases were 14-, 3-, 219-and 84-fold respectively. No increase in viral replication was observed.

Sustained active immunisation with DT toxoid has made diphtheria a clinical rarity in advanced countries. Failure to continue this policy resulted in a huge diphtheria epidemic in the early 1990s in the states comprising the former USSR. C. diphtheriae organisms multiply on the epithelial surfaces of the body (nose, throat, skin) but do not penetrate deeply into underlying tissues. The infection on the body surface causes necrosis of mucosal cells with an inflammatory exudate and the formation of a thick 'membrane' (hence the name C. diphtheriae: Gr., diphthera = membrane) and if the infection spreads into the larynx there may be respiratory obstruction. The toxin probably assists colonisation of the throat or skin by killing epithelial cells and polymorphs. DT can also be disseminated from the infection site and has important actions, especially on the heart and nervous system. However, it is a fact that the strain used for commercial production of toxin for vaccine purposes is the avirulent PW8 strain. Five per cent of all the protein made by this strain, and 75% of all protein secreted by this strain is DT and yet it is avirulent! It is the production of DT under in vivo conditions that matters.

This is particularly so among patients with impaired host defence mechanisms such as those with chronic illness, genetic immunodeficiencies, those under treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, or patients suffering from extensive burns. P. aeruginosa causes localised infection in the urinary tract, respiratory tract, burns and wound infections.

While it is not at all clear how ShT can be involved in the watery diarrhoea phase of dysentery, it is perceived as exacerbating the bloody diarrhoea phase rather than initiating it. In contrast there is now evidence that Shiga-like toxins (ShLTs) are important in haemorrhagic colitis (HC) and haemolytic urea syndrome (HUS) caused by ShLT-producing strains of enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli: EHEC has the capacity to progress disease beyond a watery diarrhea stage to HC and HUS; the latter is characterised by renal failure, thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. This virulence attribute is due to possession of one or more of a family of ShLTs. As in dysentery, the role of ShLT in the causation of watery diarrhoea is controversial and indeed it may not be absolutely necessary. However, there is no doubt that ShLT is either responsible for, or severely exacerbates the bloody diarrhoea in HC.

The massive loss of isotonic fluid with excess of sodium bicarbonate and potassium leads to hypovolaemic shock, acidosis and haemoconcentration. Anuria develops, and the collapsed, lethargic patient may die in 12-24 h. Lives are saved by replacing the lost water and salts; but the patient recovers as affected cells are shed and replaced in the normal fashion.

Very recently, spectacular advances have been made in the molecular biology of V. cholerae. Chromosomal DNA of virulent V. cholerae contains two essential genetic elements which are important in V. cholerae virulence: CTXO (the genome of a filamentous bacteriophage) which encodes the cholera toxin (CT), and a large pathogenicity island VPI (for Vibrio cholerae l~athogenicity island). VPI is now known to be the integrated genome of another large filamentous bacteriophage (VPIO) and encodes the toxin co-regulated type IV pilus (Tcp). Of the numerous colonization factors known to be produced by V. cholerae only Tcp has been proven to be important in human disease. Tcp is a remarkable entity; its subunit TcpA is a coat protein of VPIO, but it also acts as a receptor for CTXO and mediates interbacterial adherence. Thus, as a result of sequential infection by two 'pathophages', V. cholerae acquires the ability to colonise the human gut and secrete classical cholera toxin, which is a potent enterotoxin. The integration into the chromosome of these phage genomes brings their expression under the control of regulatory genes in the ancestral chromosome, whilst the replication of phages enables their interbacterial spread. CT is an 'AB' type toxin in which the pentameric B subunit recognises and binds to its cell receptor (GM1 ganglioside) thereby initiating the internalisation of the active A subunit (CTA1) and elevation of cAMP.",

A V. cholerae vaccine strain produced by the deletion/mutation of all known toxin genes yielded a vaccine strain which, although less reactogenic than wild-type virulent strains, still produced a significant diarrhoea suggesting the involvement of an inflammatory component (as yet undefined) in the causation of cholera diarrhoea. There is also experimental evidence to implicate the enteric nervous system (ENS) in cholera diarrhoea.

The causative agent, B. pertussis, is transmitted aerially from the respiratory tract of an infected individual to that of a susceptible host. The organism attaches via several adhesins -filamentous haemagglutinin, fimbriae and the 69 kDa outer-membrane protein, pertactin-to the mucosal surface between cilia, and multiplies there during the incubation period of the disease, which is commonly around 7 days. The infection then manifests as a slight fever and catarrh which is often indistinguishable from a common cold. However, 1-2 weeks later bouts of uncontrollable coughing begin. It is this paroxysmal coughing, along with the notorious 'whoop' as the child attempts to draw breath, which characterises the disease. The paroxysmal coughing stage often lasts for several weeks and no treatment is fully effective in controlling the symptoms. The only proven means of controlling whooping cough is vaccination but, in the UK at least, sporadic reports of vaccine-induced brain damage in infants has diminished public acceptance of the vaccine.

C. botulinum contaminates food, particularly inadequately preserved meat or vegetables, and produces a powerful neurotoxin. The toxin is destroyed at 80~ after 30 min -of great importance to the canning industry -and there are at least seven antigenically distinct serotypes (A-G) produced by different strains of bacteria but which have a pharmacologically similar mode of action. It is absorbed from the intestine and acts on the peripheral nervous system, interfering with the release of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses of neuromuscular junctions. Somewhere between 12 and 36 hours after ingestion there are clinical signs suggesting an acute neurological disorder, with vertigo, cranial nerve palsies and finally death a few days later with respiratory failure. A less typical form of botulism occurs in small infants. The spores, present in honey applied to rubber teats, appear to colonise the gut, so that the toxin is produced in vivo after ingestion.",

Tetanus and botulinum toxins enter neuronal tissue preferentially at motoneuronal endplates, but the nature of the relevant toxin receptors is still not known. It remains unclear why botulinum toxin acts directly at the site of uptake and not, as observed with tetanus toxin, in the central nervous system, although a considerable amount of botulinum toxin (like tetanus toxin) is retrogradely transported. Botulinum toxin blocks the release of acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions to cause flaccid paralysis. Likewise, one might ask why tetanus toxin fails to act at the motoneuronal junction at concentrations which would completely block release of neurotransmitter from GABAergic synapses. To reach inhibitory interneurons -its principal site of action tetanus toxin must leave a-motoneurons after the primary uptake step, traverse the synaptic cleft to interneurons, leave those again in order to become finally internalised again from presynaptic membranes -a route identical to that of several neurotropic viruses. It * Botulus (Latin) = sausage. In 1793 a large sausage was eaten by 13 people in Wildbad in Germany; all became ill, and six died. The disease was subsequently referred to as botulism.",

Infection of the skin in man leads to the formation of a lesion (malignant pustule; a black eschar, hence B. anthracis; Gr. anthrakos = coal) consisting of a necrotic centre surrounded by vesicles, blood-stained fluid and a zone of oedema and induration. In severe infections (nearly all cases of inhalation anthrax are fatal) there is septicaemia with toxic signs, loss of fluid into tissues, with widespread oedema and eventually death. Anthrax in man occurs mainly in those whose work brings them into contact with infected animals.

C. difficile is now established as the most common nosocomial enteric pathogen causing pseudomembranous colitis, antibiotic-associated colitis and antibioticassociated diarrhoea. The most important defence against this opportunistic pathogen is the normal colonic microflora, although the microbial species responsible for, and the mechanisms whereby they suppress the growth of C. difficile are still not understood. Disruption of the normal ecosystem by antibiotics can result in colonisation by C. difficile which, if of the right pathotype, will cause diarrhoea or, more seriously, pseudomembranous colitis. Production of proteolytic and hydrolytic enzymes and capsule, expression of fimbriae and flagella, chemotaxis and adhesion to gut receptors, may all play a part in the pathogenesis of C. difficile-induced disease by facilitating colonization or by directly contributing to tissue damage. However, toxins A and B (TcdA, TcdB) are thought to be the primary virulence determinants of this pathogen in the context of antibiotic-associated gastrointestinal disease. The toxins have identical enzyme specificities -they glucosylate the same serine residue in target proteins -but yet they have very different biological properties. B is ca. 1000-fold more cytotoxic to cultured cells than A, but does not cause fluid secretion in the gut on its own, whereas A does. A powerful case can be marshalled to implicate toxin A as the major effector in C. difficile diarrhoeal disease and of the colitis so characteristic of C. difficile infections. Several attempts have been made to explain these superficially discrepant data but perhaps the most obvious explanation is that glucosyltransferase is not the primary mechanism of toxicity! One alternative explanation is that the main effect of toxin A is to upregulate the secretion of IL-8 from colonocytes and downregulate the exocytosis of mucin. This would result in the recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells (seen in pseudomembranous colitis) with consequential indirect mucosal damage. The depression of stimulated mucin secretion (observed in toxin A treated cells in vitro) could well be explained as a secondary effect in terms of the enzymatic activity of the toxin which by disruption of the cytoskeleton would impair exocytosis.",

The latter dietary change promotes a proliferation of clostridia in the intestine which may lead to intestinal gangrene and death. ~-Toxin damages the mucosa, reduces mobility of villi and causes more bacteria to become attached to the villi. More toxin is absorbed and the mucosa and underlying intestinal wall become necrotic, leading to death in many cases.

However, the most toxic substances known to man are now being used as therapeutic agents to treat focal dystonias such as neck twists and eye squints, or eyelid closure and, more recently, some childhood palsies. The preparations are made from BoNT A and consist of toxin-haemagglutinin complex-the form in which the toxin is usually produced by the organism. This complex is less toxic than purified neurotoxin when administered parenterally but relatively more toxic when given orally; the haemagglutinin apparently protects the neurotoxin from proteolytic degradation in the gut. The effects of BoNT in relieving muscle spasms are not permanent but last for several months. Treatment has to be repeated. To date the successes significantly outweigh the failures and no long-term adverse effects have been reported. Antibody to the toxin has not so far been detected in the sera of the majority of patients. Another exciting development concerns the development and use of modified toxins as therapeutic agents. For decades, attempts have been made to make immunotoxins by coupling native toxins to antibodies specific to some surface antigen on tumour cells, with little practical success, as yet. Several attempts have been made to modify diphtheria toxin (DT), adenyl cyclase of Bordetella pertussis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A, cholera toxin and the LF anthrax toxin for selective intracellular delivery of extraneous proteins. The most successful attempt to date has been the development by Murphy and colleagues in the USA of an anticancer agent developed from DT. Their DT chimera has now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). DT comprises three functional domains: C-domain which is the toxiphore (A fragment), T-domain (in B fragment) involved in the translocation of C to the intracellular target, and R-domain (in B fragment) which recognises and binds to the receptor on sensitive cells. For DT, the receptor is an EGF-like precursor which happens to be widely distributed throughout all organ systems. DT was genetically engineered by substituting that portion of the DT structural gene encoding R domain with cDNA encoding IL-2, such that the hybrid toxin would target IL-2-receptor positive cells. The resultant fusion toxin bears a new 'cellular address', but retains all of the other biological properties of the native DT molecule as well as a three-dimensional structure nearly identical with native DT. This chimeric toxin has been shown to be safe and well tolerated and is successful in treating CTCL which expresses the high-affinity receptor for IL-2. Such constructs are potent against human CTCL and have achieved partial to durable remission of this tumour. An era of new 'magic bullets'?",

The relationship of this type of molecule to the outer membrane is also shown in Fig. 8.15 . The long-chain fatty acids interdigitate between the phospholipids in the outer leaflet and may also be linked (or interact) with lipoproteins, which in turn may or may not be covalently anchored to the rigid peptidoglycan (PG). The polysaccharide side chains project outwards. This structure is not invariant. For example, many organisms when first isolated give rise to colonies with a smooth appearance on agar but on subculture produce colonies with a rough appearance. In general, 'smooth' strains of pathogenic species are more virulent than rough strains. This S ~ R conversion is accompanied by a loss of region I side chains, which contain the deoxy and dideoxy sugars found in these LPS complexes. In addition to these somewhat drastic changes involving loss of side chains, it is possible to induce major compositional changes by manipulating the growth rate of these organisms in a chemostat. Thus the LPS of Salmonella enteriditis, when grown with a mean generation time of 20 min is nearly totally deficient in tyvelose (a dideoxy sugar), possesses 85% of the galactose and 150% of the glucose contents of LPS obtained when the generation time is 50 min. These genotypic S organisms exhibit an R-phenotype in terms of their vastly reduced O-agglutinability (see below); such observations are potentially very important in the context of the in vivo phenotype and pathogenicity, since it is well known that the growth rate of Salmonella typhimurium in mice is 10-20 times lower than in vitro.

Included among those effects which might play a role in Gram-negative bacterial infections are abortion, pyrogenicity, tolerance (not immune tolerance), the Schwartzmann phenomenon, hypotension and shock, and lethality, but the precise part played by LPS in these phenomena in Gramnegative infections is far from clear. LPS causes the release of vasoactive substances, activates the alternative pathway of the complement cascade, and also activates factor XII (Hageman factor), the first step of the coagulation cascade, which sometimes results in disseminated intravascular coagulation (p. 287). Many, perhaps nearly all, the actions of LPS are due to the stimulation of cytokine release from macrophages and other cells. There is an effect on the circulation, leading ultimately to vascular collapse. The vascular regions most affected differ from species to species; in man and sheep the main changes are found in the lungs. LPS has powerful immunological actions, which is surely no accident; as well as activating the comple-ment system, it induces IL-1 production and is a potent B-cell mitogen. Man is one of the most sensitive of all species to the pyrogenic action of endotoxin. A dose of 2 ng kg -1 of body weight injected intravenously into man causes the release of the endogenous pyrogen IL-1 and TNF from macrophages, which act on the hypothalamus to give an elevation of body temperature within an hour. It is possible that the pyrogenic action of LPS helps to generate fever in Gramnegative bacterial infections, but LPS is not the only bacterial factor capable of inducing a febrile response.

It is therefore not unreasonable to ask how many of the wellknown toxins are actually useful to the microbe as well as being important in causing disease in the host (Table 8 .4).

Host cells are destroyed or blood vessels injured as a direct result of the action of microbes or their toxins. Blood vessel injuries account for much of the disease picture in rickettsial infections (see above). Inflammatory materials are liberated from necrotic cells, whatever the cause of the necrosis. Also many bacteria themselves liberate inflammatory products and certain viruses cause living infected cells to release inflammatory mediators. Therefore it is not always clear how much of the inflammation is directly microbial rather than host in origin.* But inevitably the host (see Ch. 3) generates inflammatory and other tissue responses, and these responses sometimes account for the greater part of the tissue changes. Pathological changes can then be regarded as occurring indirectly as a result of these responses to the infection. Inflammation causes redness, swelling, pain and sometimes loss of * For instance, peptidoglycan of H. influenzae type b causes acute inflammation when introduced into the cerebrospinal fluid of adult rats. Probably much of this is caused by inflammatory mediators from the host; TNF-r is detectable in cerebrospinal fluid of most cases of purulent bacterial meningitis in humans and there are raised concentrations in the serum of patients with P. falciparum malaria. function of the affected part (see Ch. 6), and is generally a major cause of the signs and symptoms of disease. Indirect damage attributable to the host immune response is discussed separately below. In most diseases direct and indirect types of damage both make a contribution to pathological changes, but in a given disease one or the other may be the most important. In a staphylococcal abscess the bacteria produce inflammatory materials, but they also kill infiltrating polymorphs whose lysosomal enzymes are thereby liberated and induce further inflammation. This type of indirect nonimmunological damage is sometimes important in streptococcal infections. Virulent streptococci produce various toxins that damage phagocytes, and also bear on their surfaces substances that impede phagocytosis (see Ch. 4). Nevertheless, with the help of antibody, all streptococci are eventually phagocytosed and killed and the infection terminated. Unlike the staphylococci, however, killed group A streptococci pose a digestive problem for phagocytic cells. The peptidoglycan component of the streptococcal cell wall is very resistant to digestion by lysosomal enzymes. When streptococci are injected into the skin of a rabbit, for instance, streptococcal peptidoglycans persist in macrophages for as long as 146 days. Hence macrophages laden with indigestible streptococcal cell walls tend to accumulate in sites of infection. Lysosomal enzymes, including collagenase, leak from these macrophages, causing local destruction of collagen fibres and the connective tissue matrix. Macrophages secrete many other substances some of which may contribute to cell and tissue damage (see also pp. 95-96). Many macrophages eventually die or form giant cells, sometimes giving rise to granulomatous lesions (see p. 322). In this way persistent streptococcal materials sometimes cause chronic inflammatory lesions in the infected host. An additional immunopathological contribution to the lesions is to be expected if the host is sensitised to peptidoglycan components. Other pathogenic microorganisms that are digested with difficulty by phagocytes include Listeria, Shigella, Candida albicans and, of course, Mycobacteria, but the importance of this in the pathogenesis of disease is not generally clear.",

Such changes caused by the immune response are classed as immunopathological. Sometimes they are very severe, leading to serious disease or death, but at other times they play a minimal part in the pathogenesis of disease. With the possible exception of certain vertically transmitted virus infections and the transmissible 'prion' dementias (see Ch. 10), there are signs of an immune response in all infections. Therefore it is to be expected that there will nearly always be some contribution of the immune response to pathological changes.* Often the immunological contribution is small, but sometimes it forms a major part of the disease. For instance, in tuberculosis the pathological picture is dominated by the operation of a strong and persistent cell-mediated immunity (CMI) response to the invading bacillus. In the classical tubercle a central zone of bacilli with large mononuclear and giant cells, often with some necrosis, is surrounded by fibroblasts and lymphocytes. Mononuclear infiltrations, giant cells and granulomatous lesions (see p. 322) are characteristic pathological features of tuberculosis. When macrophages are killed by intracellular mycobacteria the lysosomal enzymes and other materials released from the degenerating cell contribute to chronic inflammation as in the case of the streptococcal lesions referred to above. There are no recognised toxins formed by tubercle bacilli, and there seems to be no single antigen or other component that accounts for virulence. Bacterial glycolipids (e.g. 'cord factor'), resistance to H202 (see pp. 91-92) and ability to utilise host Fe (see p. 387) have been correlated with pathogenicity, and inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion in macrophages (see p. 106) by release of unidentified bacterial components would also contribute to pathogenicity. However, none of these factors is by itself absolutely necessary for virulence, which in such a complex, ancient parasite is likely to be multifactorial. Now that the genome of M. tuberculosis has been completely sequenced, there will be opportunities for clearer definition of virulence determinants. The mere enlargement of lymphoid organs during infectious diseases is a morphological change that can often be regarded as pathological. The lymph node swelling seen in glandular fever, for instance, is an immunopathological feature of the disease, and the same can be said of the striking enlargement of the spleen caused by chronic malaria and other infections in the condition known as tropical splenomegaly.",

Slow leakage of worm antigens means that mast cells are sensitised with specific IgE antibody, and the sudden release of antigen can cause life-threatening anaphylaxis. When the larvae ofAscaris lumbri-coides pass through the lung on their journey from blood to intestine, they can give rise to IgE-mediated respiratory symptoms, with infiltration of eosinophils.",

In the infected host, these inflammatory phenomena are most of the time of great antimicrobial value (see Ch. 6). But there are nevertheless immunopathological features of the infection, and immune complex reactions sometimes do a great deal of damage in the infected individual. The mechanisms by which antigen-antibody reactions cause inflammation and tissue damage are outlined in Fig. 8.16 . IgA immune complexes are generally less harmful. Antigens absorbed from the intestine can combine locally with IgA antibody and the complex then enters the blood, to be filtered out in the liver and excreted harmlessly in bile (see p. 160). When the antigen-antibody reaction takes place in extravascular tissues, there is inflammation and oedema with infiltration of polymorphs. If soluble antigen is injected intradermally into an individual with large amounts of circulating IgG antibody, the antigen-antibody reaction takes place in the walls of skin blood vessels, and causes an inflammatory response. The extravasating polymorphs degenerate and their lysosomal enzymes cause extensive vascular damage. This is the classical Arthus response. Antigen-antibody reactions in tissues are not usually as serious as this, and milder inflammatory sequelae are more common as in the case of allergic alveolitis (see below).",

When equal amounts of antigen and antibody combine, lattice structures are produced, and these form large aggregates whose size ensures that they are also rapidly removed by reticuloendothelial cells. If, however, complexes are formed in antigen excess, the poorly coated antigen molecules are not removed by reticuloendothelial cells. They continue to circulate in the blood and have the opportunity to localise in small blood vessels elsewhere in the body. The mechanism is not clear, but complexes are deposited in the glomeruli of the kidneys, the choroid plexuses, joints and ciliary body of the eye. Factors may include local high blood pressure and turbulent flow (glomeruli), or the filtering function of the vessels involved (choroid plexus, ciliary body). In the glomeruli the complexes pass through the endothelial windows ( Fig. 8.17 ) and come to lie beneath the basement membrane.

Mesangial cells, one of whose functions is to deal with such materials, enlarge, multiply and extend into the subepithelial space. If these changes are gradual there are no inflammatory changes, but the structure of the basement membrane alters, allowing proteins to leak through into the urine. Later the filtering function of the glomerulus becomes progressively impaired. In the first place the glomerular capillary is narrowed by the mesangial cell intrusion. Also, the filtering area is itself blocked by the mesangial cell intrusion, by the accumulation of complexes (Fig. 8.17) , and by alterations in the structure of the basement membrane.

Non-neutralising antibodies help promote virus persistence because they combine specifically with virus particles, fail to render them noninfectious, and at the same time block the action of any good neutralising antibodies that may be present. Immune complexes in antigen excess are formed in the blood when the persistent virus or its antigens circulates in the plasma and reacts with antibody which is present in relatively small amounts.

In both these examples microbial antigens circulate in the blood for long periods. However, immune complex deposition does not necessarily lead to the development of glomerulonephritis, and immune complexes are detectable in the glomeruli of most normal mice and monkeys. Even in persistent virus infections the rate of deposition may be too slow to cause pathological changes as with LDV and leukaemia virus infections of mice (see Table 8 .5). During the acute stage of hepatitis B in man, when antibodies are first formed against excess circulating viral antigen (hepatitis B surface antigen), immune complexes are formed and deposited in glomeruli. However, the deposition is short-lived and there is no glomerulonephritis. Persistent carriers of the antigen do not generally develop glomerulonephritis, because their antibody is usually directed against the 'core' antigen of the virus particle, rather than against the large amounts of circulating hepatitis B surface antigen. Immune complex glomerulonephritis occurs in man as an important complication of streptococcal infection, but this is usually acute in nature with complement activation and inflammation of glomeruli, as referred to above. Antibodies formed against an unknown component of the streptococcus react with circulating streptococcal antigen, perhaps also with a circulating host antigen, and immune complexes are deposited in glomeruli. Streptococcal antibodies cross-reacting with the glomerular basement membrane or with streptococcal antigen trapped in the basement membrane may contribute to the picture. Deposition of complexes continues after the infection is terminated, and glomerulonephritis develops a week or two later. The streptococcal infection may be of the throat or skin, and Streptococcus pyogenes types 12 and 49 are frequently involved.",

They are not protected against the second virus, although it shows immunological cross-reactions with the first one. Indeed the dengue-specific antibodies enhance infection of susceptible mononuclear cells, so that larger amounts of viral antigen are produced (see p. 173).

When inoculated intranasally, the virus infects the lungs and causes a fatal pneumonia in which the airspaces fill up with fluid and cells. The reaction is massive and the lungs almost double in weight. Effectively the animal drowns. The cause is an influx of virus-specific CD8 \u00a7 T cells. Normally when an appropriate number ofT cells had entered the lungs, the T cells would issue a feedback response to prevent such overaccumulation, but it is thought that influenza virus infects the T cells and inhibits this control process, so that the lungs are eventually overwhelmed. The virus does not multiply in or kill the infected T cells, and it is presumed that it undergoes limited gene expression.",

Children with thymic aplasia show a general failure to develop T lymphocytes and cell-mediated immunity, but have normal antibody responses to most antigens. They suffer a fatal disease if they are infected with measles virus. Instead of the limited extent of virus growth and disease seen in the respiratory tract in normal children, there is inexorable multiplication of virus in the lung, in spite of antibody formation, giving rise to giant cell pneumonia. This indicates that the CMI response is essential for the control of virus growth. In addition there is a total absence of the typical measles rash, and this further indicates that the CMI response is also essential for the production of the skin lesions. Cell-mediated immune responses also make a contribution to the rashes in poxvirus infections.",

The stress changes mediated by adrenal cortical hormones come into this category. Stress is a general term used to describe various noxious influences, and includes cold, heat, starvation, injury, psychological stress and infection. An infectious disease is an important stress, and corticosteroids are secreted in large amounts in severe infections (see also Ch. 11). They generally tend to inhibit the development of pathological changes, but also have pronounced effects on lymphoid tissues, causing thymic involution and lymphocyte destruction. These can be regarded as pathological changes caused by stress. It was the very small size of the thymus gland as seen in children dying with various diseases, especially infectious diseases, that for many years contributed to the neglect of this important organ, and delayed appreciation of its vital role in the development of the immune system.",

Properly controlled experiments are difficult to mount but it is clear that the nervous system affects the functioning of the immune system. The pathways of this communication are still poorly understood, but there is a shared language for immune and neural cells. For example, neural cells as well as immune cells have receptors for interleukins, and lymphocytes and macrophages secrete pituitary growth hormone. Work on Mycobacterium bovis grew out of observations from the turn of the century that stress appears to increase the death rate in children with tuberculosis (TB). In one type of experiment mice were stressed by being kept in a restraining device where movement was virtually impossible. This resulted in the reduction of expression of MHC class II antigens on macrophages, which correlated with increased susceptibility to infection. Similarly stressing mice infected with influenza virus caused several immunosuppressive events including reduction of inflammatory cells in the lung, and decreased production of IL-2. Suppression of antibody responses is found in people suffering a type of stress familiar to students -examinations! The best responses to hepatitis B vaccine in students immunised on the third day of their examinations were found in those who reported the least stress. Finally, in a double-blind trial at the Common Cold Research Unit in England with five different respiratory viruses, it was ascertained in human volunteers that stress gave a small but statistically significant increased likelihood of an individual developing clinical disease.",

Yellow fever is a virus infection trans-mitted by mosquitoes and in its severest form is characterised by devastating liver lesions. There is massive mid-zonal liver necrosis following the extensive growth of virus in liver cells, resulting in the jaundice that gives the disease its name. Destruction of the liver also leads to a decrease in the rate of formation of the blood coagulation factor, prothrombin, and infected human beings or monkeys show prolonged coagulation and bleeding times. Haemorrhagic phenomena are therefore characteristic of severe yellow fever, including haemorrhage into the stomach and intestine. In the stomach the appearance of blood is altered by acid, and the vomiting of altered blood gave yellow fever another of its names, 'black vomit disease'. Haemorrhagic phenomena in infectious diseases can be due to direct microbial damage to blood vessels, as in certain rickettsial infections (see p. 140) or in the virus infection responsible for haemorrhagic disease of deer. They may also be due to immunological damage to vessels as in the Arthus response or immune complex vasculitis, to any type of severe inflammation, and to the indirect mechanism illustrated above. Finally there are a few infectious diseases in which platelets are depleted, sometimes as a result of their combination with immune complexes plus complement, giving thrombocytopenia and a haemorrhagic tendency (see also disseminated intravascular coagulation, p. 287).

Sometimes the host cell is transformed by the virus and converted into a tumour cell, the virus either introducing a transforming gene into the cell, activating expression of a pre-existing cellular gene, or inactivating the cell's own fail-safe tumour suppressor gene. The transforming genes of DNA tumour viruses generally code for T antigens which are necessary for transformation, and the transforming genes of RNA tumour viruses are known as onc genes.* * Onc genes (oncogenes) are also present in host cells, where they play a role in normal growth and differentiation, often coding for recognised growth factors (e.g. human platelet-derived growth factor).

On the other hand, a given infection generates antimicrobial responses such as interferon production and macrophage activation which would make a second infection less likely. Dual infections are commonest when local defences have been damaged by the first invader. The pathological results are made much more severe because there is a second infectious agent present. This can be considered as another mechanism of pathogenicity. Classical instances involve the respiratory tract. The destruction of ciliated epithelium in the lung by viruses such as influenza or measles allows normally nonpathogenic resident bacteria of the nose and throat, such as the pneumococcus or Haemophilus influenzae, to invade the lung and cause secondary pneumonia. If these bacteria enter the lung under normal circumstances, they are destroyed by alveolar macrophages or removed by the mucociliary escalator. In at least one instance the initial virus infection appears to act by interfering with the function of alveolar macrophages. Mice infected with parainfluenza 1 (Sendai) virus show greatly increased susceptibility to infection with Haemophilus influenzae, and this is largely due to the fact that alveolar macrophages infected with virus show a poor ability to phagocytose and kill the bacteria. Specialised respiratory pathogens such as influenza, measles, parainfluenza or rhinoviruses damage the nasopharyngeal mucosa and can lead in the same way to secondary bacterial infection, with nasal catarrh, sinusitis, otitis media or mastoiditis. The normal microbial flora of the mouth, nasopharynx or intestine are always ready to cause trouble if host resistance is lowered, but under normal circumstances they hinder rather than help other infecting microorganisms (see Ch. 2).",

Particularly in infants, who have a very high turnover of water relative to their size, the loss of fluid and salt soon leads to lifethreatening illness. In 1998, diarrhoea was responsible for 2.2 million deaths world-wide in children under 5 years old. In villages in West Africa and Guatemala, the average 2-3-year-old child has diarrhoea for about 2 months in each year.* Diarrhoea also interacts with malnutrition and can cause stunted growth, defective immune responses and susceptibility to other infections (pp. 377-379). Fluid and electrolyte replacement is a simple, highly effective, life-saving treatment that can be used without determining the cause of the diarrhoea. Oral rehydration therapy (ORF) means giving a suitable amount of salt and sugar in clean water, and this is something that can be done by the mother. Diarrhoea is also a common affliction of travellers from developed countries, and business deals, athletic successes and holiday pleasures can be forfeited on the toilet seats of foreign lands. The most reliable prophylaxis is to 'cook it, peel it, or forget it'. Most attacks of diarrhoea are self-limiting. Diarrhoea means the passage of liquid faeces,t or faeces that take the shape of the receptacle rather than have their own shape. This could arise because of increased rate of propulsion by intestinal muscles, giving less time for reabsorption of water in the large bowel, or because there was an increase in the amount of fluid held or produced in the intestine. In many types of infectious diarrhoea the exact mechanism is not known. Diarrhoea, on the one hand, can be * Diarrhoea on a massive scale is not always confined to developing countries. There was a major outbreak of Cryptosporidium infection in Milwaukee, USA, in 1993 with more than 400 000 cases; 285 of these were diagnosed in the laboratory and they suffered watery diarrhoea (mean 12 stools a day) for a mean of 9 days. The small (4-5 mm) oocysts, probably from cattle, had entered Lake Michigan, and then reached the community water supply because of inadequate filtration and coagulation treatment.",

            "text": "regarded as a microbial device for promoting the shedding and spreading of the infection in the community, or, on the other hand, as a host device to hasten expulsion of the infectious agent. Diarrhoea is a superb mechanism for the dissemination of infected faeces (see p. 58) and there is no doubt that strains of microbes are selected for their diarrhoea-producing powers. The advantages to the host of prompt expulsion of the infectious agent was illustrated when volunteers infected with Shigella flexneri were given Lomotil, a drug that inhibits peristalsis. They were more likely to develop fever and had more difficulty in eliminating the pathogen. Before attempting to explain the pathophysiology of diarrhoeal disease, the normal structure and function of gut will be considered. The main function of the gut is the active inward transport of ions and nutrient solutes which is followed by the passive movement of water ( Fig. 8.18 ). The driving force is the Na+/K \u00a7 ATPase situated in the basolateral membrane of enterocytes on the villus (Fig. 8.18 ), which maintains a low intracellular [Na+], thus creating the electrochemical gradient favourable for Na \u00a7 entry and a high regional [Na \u00a7 in the intercellular spaces; C1-follows Na \u00a7 A similar situation exists in crypt cells: Na \u00a7 \u00a7 ATPase drives secretion. The key difference is the location of the carrier systems responsible for the facilitated entry of the actively transported species. In villus cells the carriers are present in the brush border, whereas in crypt cells they are located in the basal membrane: this is responsible for the vectorial aspects of ion/fluid traffic in villus/crypt assemblies. However, it is clear that several factors in addition to enterocytes are involved in regulating fluid transport in the gut; these include the enteric nervous system and the anatomy of the microcirculation. The latter plays a profoundly important role in the uptake of fluid. This is illustrated in Fig. 8.19 , which shows the existence of zones of graded osmotic potential. At the tips of villi in adult human gut, osmolalities range from 700 to 800 mOsm kg -1 H20, which would generate huge osmotic forces. Thus, current perceptions are that enterocytes are responsible for generating this gradient and the blood supply acts as a countercurrent multiplier which amplifies the gradient in a manner analogous to the loops of Henle in the kidney. The hypertonic zone has been demonstrated directly in whole villi of infant mice in terms of the changing morphology of erythrocytes: in the lower regions of villi they show characteristic discoid morphology, whereas in the upper region they are crenated, indicating a hyperosmotic environment. The hypertonicity is dissipated if the blood flow is too slow and washed out if too fast. It is the villus unit rather than enterocytes by themselves that is responsible for fluid uptake. Another consequence of the microcirculatory anatomy is that villus tip regions are relatively hypoxic. In addition, neonatal brush borders contain disaccharidases (principally lactase) which break down nonabsorbable disaccharides (e.g. lactose) into constituent absorbable monosaccharides. (a) Two methods of Na \u00a7 co-transport are shown involving a glucose-linked symport and two coupled antiports; the latter results in the co-transport of C1-. The coupled antiports are functionally linked via H \u00a7 and HCO3, the relative concentrations of which are a reflection of metabolic activity. These processes occur within the same cells but are shown separately for clarity. The driving force for Na \u00a7 uptake is the low Na \u00a7 concentration maintained by the Na \u00a7 \u00a7 pump (ATPase) which creates the electrochemical gradient that promotes the inward movement of Na+; C1-follows Na \u00a7 by diffusion. Water is drawn osmotically across the epithelium paracellularly (i.e. across tight junctions) and/or transcellularly, the former pathway accounting for approximately 80% of fluid movement.",

Note the central arterial vessel (AV) which arborizes at the tip into a capillary bed drained by a subepithelial venous return (VR).

This results in a progressive increase in the osmolarity of incoming blood moving into the tip region through to VR. Tip osmolarity is about three times higher than normal.

In developing countries the most common clinical presentation is mild watery diarrhoea, whereas in developed countries disease often manifests as a severe inflammatory diarrhoea. No evidence has yet been found to suggest that the watery type and severe bloody type of diarrhoeas can be explained in terms of a C. jejuni equivalent of the ETEC and EHEC mechanisms described above.

Guillain-Barr~ syndrome is a peripheral neuropathy, and one possible cause may be an autoimmune phenomenon arising from molecular mimicry between the polysaccharide side chains of C. jejuni and neural gangliosides.* While there are reasonable models for studying colonisation and initial invasion, there is a problem regarding experimental animal models in which to reproduce the extreme form of bloody diarrhoea seen in humans. However, the situation concerning C. jejuni is probably about to change dramatically. New strategies based on the use of the new technology of 'microarrays'~ are now being used. By this means, and by reference to the genomic atlas, it is theoretically possible to identify which genes are expressed under different sets of experimental conditions including those which mimic the infection environment. Doubtless a plethora of new data is about to be generated from which we hope to learn more of the disease-conferring attributes of C. jejuni and related species.",

Oral infection of the gut induces ischaemia in villi, followed by hypoxia, enterocyte damage, and shortening of villi. The perception is that it is the induction of ischaemia and not viral replication per se that results in these changes. It is during rapid resynthesis of the atrophied villi that maximum diarrhoea occurs due to the transient accumulation of excess NaC1 in dividing cells. Prolongation of diarrhoea is seen to be due to the hyperaemic state of the newly reconstructed villi which reduces the hypertonicity of villi. Resolution of the diarrhoea occurs when microcirculation is restored to normal with concomitant restoration of hypertonic tip zones in villi.",

However, the observed pathology will be different according to age, host species, or the inducing pathogen. For example, in rotavirus-infected lambs, villus atrophy and crypt hypertrophy occur (the latter indicative of crypt cell division) but as in mice, infected lambs are not lactose intolerant. In rotavirus-infected swine piglets, crypt hypertrophy occurs but villus atrophy is severe, the animals are lactose intolerant and mortality is high; a similar situation exists for the coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus of swine. The latter has often been used as the model for infantile diarrhoea but the question is whether human infants are more like piglets or lambs. Clinical studies have shown that recovery from mild, acute gastroenteritis of rotavirus origin occurs within 2 weeks irrespective of the carbohydrate ingested. Clearly, the severity of disease and the clinical outcome will depend on the extent of 'vertical' villus/crypt involvement and the regions of intestine infected. When villus erosion is severe, then lactose may cause an 'osmotic' purge or be fermented by intestinal bacteria to short-chain fatty acids which stimulate secretion in the colon. Astroviruses, Norwalk virus, caliciviruses and certain adenoviruses all cause gastroenteritic disease by infecting enterocytes. However, parvoviruses cause severe intestinal disease in dogs by virtue of their predilection for the mitotically active crypt cells which is the cause of the nearcomplete erosion of villi similar to that seen after exposure to sublethal doses of irradiation.",

It has recently been shown that a non-structural rotavirus protein, NSP4, induces diarrhoea in mice when introduced into the ileum, by causing increased C1-secre-tion. An apparent exception to the 'rule' that viruses do not form toxins! Entamoeba histolytica causes lysis of target cells apparently by direct contact with the cell membrane. This pathogen produces under in vitro conditions a spectacular array of potential (but as yet unproven) virulence determinants including: proteases that round up cells, pore-forming proteins, collagenases and oligosaccharidases and neurotransmitter-like compounds; the latter can induce intestinal fluid secretion. Some of these factors have been implicated as the determinants responsible for liver abscess formation.",

Madshus and H. Stenmark) and publisher (Springer-Verlag GmbH & Co. KG, Heidelberg, Germany) fromFig. 1in 'Entry of ADP-ribosylating toxins into cells', Curr. Topics Microbiol.  Immunol., 1992, 175, 3, edited by K. Aktories.)    The A fragment is the 'active' toxiphore and the B fragment bears the receptor-binding domain and also mediates translocation of A into the cytoplasm. Examples include diphtheria toxin (DT), Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PEA)(Fig. 8.5), and the clostridial neurotoxins (BoNT and TeTx)(Fig. 8.6).",
