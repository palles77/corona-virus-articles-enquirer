Infectious myositis is most commonly caused by bacteria; however, a variety of viral, parasitic, and fungal agents may also cause myositis. The pathogenesis of nonbacterial infectious myositis is via direct or hematogenous infection of the musculature or immune mechanisms. Symptoms typically include muscular pain, tenderness, swelling, and/or weakness. The diagnosis of the specific microbe is often suggested by the presence of concordant clinical signs and symptoms, a detailed medical and travel history, and laboratory data. For example, immunocompromised hosts have a heightened risk of fungal myositis, whereas the presence of a travel history to an endemic location and/or eosinophilia may suggest a parasitic cause. Definitive diagnosis requires detecting the organism by specific laboratory testing including serologies, histopathology, and/or cultures. Treatment entails antimicrobial agents against the pathogen, with consideration for surgical drainage for focal purulent collections within the musculature.",

A Gram stain as well as other microbiologic stains (eg, Gomori-Grocott methenamine silver stain for fungi), histopathologic examination, and cultures should be performed as suggested by the history. In cases of diffuse muscle involvement, the workup is largely based on the presence of other clinical symptoms and examination findings. For example, in cases in which a viral cause is suspected, standard viral testing should be ordered.

Fungal myositis is uncommon, and in temperate areas, most often occurs among immunosuppressed patients. Parasitic myositis should be considered in the setting of a compatible exposure history and/or concurrent eosinophilia.
