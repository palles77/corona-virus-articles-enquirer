Meanwhile, the outbreak of this novel virus has placed 70 unprecedented challenges on hospital environmental hygiene. The occurrence of 71 medical staff-associated infections is closely related to long-lived pathogens in the 72 hospital environment [4, 5] . Thus, it is crucial to assess hospital environmental hygiene 73 to understand the most important environmental issues for controlling the spread of 74 COVID-19 in hospitals. The Chinese government quickly adopted quarantine 75 measures for confirmed and suspected patients to restrain the spread of the 76 pandemic [6] . Comprehensive monitoring of hospital environmental hygiene during the 77 outbreak of the pandemic is conducive to the refinement of hospital infection control 78 [5, 7] . It also increases understanding of the environmental challenges corresponding to 79 the reemergence of COVID-19 or similar viruses. Therefore, it is of great significance 80 to ensure the safety of medical treatment and the quality of hospital infection control 81 through the monitoring of environmental hygiene. According to a report from the The environmental monitoring methods referenced the hospital sanitation standards 106 (GB15982-2012).

The hermetic spaces of isolation 164 wards are weak in air flow, which may cause high contact with the virus. Additionally, 165 the confirmed patient underwent tracheal intubation the day before the samples were 166 collected, and this procedure produced large amounts of aerosols that spread in the 167 wards and seriously polluted the air. Siegel et al. reported that medical ventilators 168 might generate respiratory aerosols that have been associated with an increased risk of 169 occupationally acquired infections among healthcare personnel [12] . Therefore, it is 170 necessary to increase the intensity of disinfection for isolation wards with intensive 171 care patients. For example, we should enhance ventilator exhaust management by 172 adding ventilator exhaust port filters. 173 The suspected and confirmed patients stay a relatively long time in the high-risk area 174 and may influence the environment. The intrusive and other operations that can easily 175 produce aerosols may cause serious air pollution. The sites under observation without 176 patients and operations have less impact on the environment. The samples from the 177 same collection points were tested after a series of infection prevention and control 178 measures were taken, such as continuous use of an air disinfection machine for the 179 disinfection of ward air; extending the frequency of disinfection for ground and object 180 surfaces; changing gloves and cleaning hands after operations and leaving the ward; effectiveness of disinfection. In the high-risk areas, such as hospital pre-check triages 184 and the fever clinic, due to the open environment and large amount of air flowresearch reports that the routine cleaning and disinfection procedures are 187 the most likely cause of the deficiency of disinfection in the hospital environment, 188 leading to the spread of pathogens [13] . In our study, viruses were detected on the 189 surfaces of the nurse station in the isolation area with suspected patients, suggesting 190 that we need to strengthen the surface disinfection of nurse stations, especially 191 focusing on computer keyboards, mice and types of equipment that are not easy to 192 disinfect. A large number of studies have shown that the hands or gloves of medical 193 staff members may be contaminated by contact with environmental surfaces 194 contaminated by pathogens [13-15] . In the process of diagnosis and treatment, pathogens 195 may be transmitted to patients and cause hospital-associated infections. Therefore, it 196 is also very important to further strengthen the hand hygiene of the medical staff. 197 We need to formulate refinement measures based on environmental hygiene 198 monitoring data to improve the quality of hospital infection control. Due to fact that 199 \"uncultivable\" microbes widely exist, traditional methods used to measure the effect 200 of hospital infection control, such as sedimentation (exposing a microbial growth 201 plate to the environment) have shown limited effects and poor sensitivity. For which to monitor the environment and to evaluate the effectiveness of disinfection, 206 especially for highly contagious diseases or pathogenic microorganisms with a 207 potential aerosol risk, such as COVID-19. These nucleic acid detection results are 208 very important for standardized hospital infection control. This study also increases 209 our understanding of the environmental challenges corresponding to the reemergence 210 of COVID-19 or similar viruses. 211 The data obtained in this study suggest that COVID-19 exists in the air of isolation 212 wards with intensive care patients and existed on the surfaces of nurse stations and 213 that medical staff encounter this virus in the air and on surfaces during patient care 214activities. An effective disinfection procedure may reduce the biosafety risk.215    For hospital infection control, we suggest:216    1. Different people should be responsible for the isolation observation area and the 217 isolation ward area; crossing the areas should be strictly prohibited.218    2. Objects in each area should be used exclusively; equipment that must be used for 219 special purposes should be sterilized before being used in other areas.220    3. Hand hygiene rules should be observed strictly, thoroughly and at all times.",
