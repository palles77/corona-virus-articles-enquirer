            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) continues to cause zoonotic infections 17 and serious disease, primarily in the Arabian Peninsula, due to repeated spill-over from dromedary 18 camels and subsequent nosocomial transmission. Approved MERS vaccines for use in animals or 19 humans are not currently available. MERS-CoV replication requires the virus-encoded papain-like 20 protease (PL pro ) to cleave multiple sites in the viral replicase polyproteins, thereby releasing 21 functional non-structural proteins. Additionally, PL pro is a deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) that can 22 remove ubiquitin(-like) moieties from substrates, presumably to counteract host antiviral responses. 23 In previous work, we determined the crystal structure of MERS-CoV PL pro in complex with ubiquitin, 24 facilitating the design of PL pro mutations that impair DUB activity without affecting viral polyprotein 25 cleavage. Here, we introduced these DUB-inactivating mutations into the viral genome and 26 examined their impact on MERS-CoV infection both in cell culture and in a lethal mouse model. 27 Although overall replication of DUB-negative and wild-type (wt) recombinant MERS-CoV was 28 comparable in multiple cell lines, infection with DUB-negative virus markedly increased mRNA levels 29 for interferon (IFN)-\u03b2 and IFN-stimulated genes. Moreover, compared to a wt virus infection, the 30 survival rate was significantly increased when DUB-negative MERS-CoV was used to infect transgenic 31 mice expressing a human MERS-CoV receptor. Interestingly, DUB-negative and wt MERS-CoV 32 replicated to the same titers in lungs of infected mice, but the DUB-negative virus was cleared faster, 33 likely due to the observed accelerated and better-regulated innate immune responses, in contrast to 34 delayed and subsequently excessive responses in wt virus-infected mice. This study provides the first 35 direct evidence that the DUB activity of a coronaviral protease contributes to innate immune evasion 36 and can profoundly enhance virulence in an animal model. Thus, reduction or removal of the innate 37 immune-suppressive DUB activity of PL pro s is a promising strategy for coronavirus attenuation in the 38 context of rational vaccine development.",

In the DUB-negative virus group, the increase of innate immune 505 transcripts was slightly lower relative to 2 days p.i. (Fig 6) , and the variation in mRNA levels between 506 the four mice was smaller in this group at 4 days than at 2 days p.i. (S1 Fig, compare showed, however, a very strong increase in transcript levels for all tested targets between 2 and 4 510 days p.i. Especially the mRNA levels of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb, and IL-6 were remarkably upregulated (Fig 6A, B,   511 and F). Together, this demonstrates that between 2 and 4 days p.i. the mRNA levels of innate 512 immune factors, cytokines, and chemokines were already down-regulated in the DUB-negative virus-513 infected mice, in contrast to the strong upregulation observed for rMERS-CoV wt-infected mice.

Coronaviral PL pro s constitute a striking example of this kind of dual functionality, 537 as they not only cleave multiple sites in the replicase polyproteins of which they are part, but can 538 also deconjugate Ub, and Ub-like modifiers such as ISG15, presumably to suppress innate immune 539 responses (55). Studying this DUB activity in the context of the CoV-infected cell is difficult because 540 both PL pro functionalities rely on the same enzymatic active site, which cannot be inactivated without 541 killing virus replication. Therefore, in our earlier research, we explored an alternative approach to 542 selectively inactivate the DUB activity of MERS-CoV PL pro . Based on the available crystal structure of 543 the PL pro -Ub complex, we disrupted the enzyme's Ub-binding site to minimize its affinity for Ub (65).",

Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb) induce expression of interferon-stimulated 84 genes (ISGs) with the distinction that, due to receptor restrictions, IFN-\u03bb can only induce ISGs in 85 epithelial cells, whereas ISGs induced by type I IFNs can be expressed by virtually any cell type (14, 86 15). ISGs are antiviral effector proteins that limit virus replication and spread. Moreover, some ISGs 87 can enhance pathogen recognition and thereby innate immune signalling (16). NF-\u03baB-mediated 88 production of cytokines like TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8, are important for the inflammatory response as 89 well as for attracting and activating immune cells (17). Type I IFNs also play a major role in 90 stimulating expression and production of other immune mediators like IFN-\u03b3 and cytokines by 91 diverse innate immune cells. Additionally, antigen presentation by dendritic cells is enhanced and 92 also the survival and activity of B and T cells is modulated by type I IFNs, which underlines the 93 importance of type I IFNs in shaping adaptive immune responses (18, 19). The fine-tuning of innate 94 immune responses is crucial and therefore the activities of signalling molecules in these pathways 95 are tightly regulated by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination 96 (20). Ubiquitination is the covalent conjugation of ubiquitin (Ub), an evolutionally conserved protein, 97 via attachment of its C-terminal Gly76 residue to the N-terminal residue or any Lys residue of a 98 protein substrate (21). Conjugation of Ub can also occur to previously conjugated Ub moieties on the 99 N-terminus or at any of the seven Lys residues in Ub itself, leading to the formation of polyUb chains 100 with different topologies and functions (22, 23). Ubiquitination is performed by a cascade of three 101 enzymes: an E1 Ub-activating enzyme, an E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme and an E3 Ub ligase. The 102 reverse reaction, the removal of Ub from substrates, is performed by proteases that are known as 103 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) (24). In the context of the innate immune response, ubiquitination 104 is essential for the activation or induced degradation of many factors in the signalling cascade, while 105 specific cellular DUBs can downregulate the signalling to protect cells from adverse over-reactions of 106 the system (25, 26).

Accessory ORFs like ORF5 are dispensable for MERS-CoV replication in cell culture 322 and their protein products have been implicated in suppression of the innate immune response and 323 NF-\u03baB activation (45, 68). Indeed, deletion of ORF5 did not alter virus replication compared to wt 324 MERS-CoV in Vero 81, HuH7, and Calu-3 cells (45, 75). However, higher levels of inflammatory 325 cytokines were produced in Calu-3 cells upon infection with virus lacking ORF5 compared to wt virus 326 (45). To avoid complications due to ORF5 evolution and associated changes in host immune 327 suppression while generating PL pro mutant virus stocks for our studies, all PL pro mutants were 328 engineered using a full-length construct containing the premature stop codon at ORF5 codon 108. 329 Into this backbone, we subsequently introduced substitutions, based on the MERS-CoV pp1a/pp1ab 330 amino acid numbering, V1691R, T1653R, and V1674S, as well as the combinations T1653R+V1691R 331 and T1653R+V1674S+V1691R (named \"double mutant\" and \"triple mutant\", respectively, from this 332 point on).

            "text": "These results resemble the late and excessive IFN and 621 pro-inflammatory cytokine response that likely contributes to lung immunopathology as observed 622 for SARS-CoV infection in mice (38, 76). Recently, it was also demonstrated that the timing of the 623 type I IFN response was crucial in the outcome of a MERS-CoV infection in mice (82). In line with our 624 results, early administration of type I IFN was protective (comparable to responses induced by DUB-625 negative rMERS-CoV) whereas late administration promoted lethality (like in wt rMERS-CoV-infected 626 mice) (82). Together, these observations support a concept in which delayed and aberrantly 627 regulated innate immune response as a result of viral innate immune evasion importantly 628 contributes to pathogenesis during infection. Notably, it is possible that other cellular processes 629 besides innate immunity are influenced by PL pro s DUB activity, which might also affect mice survival. 630 Therefore, it remains important to make a full inventory of cellular protein targets that are 631 deubiquitinated by PL pro , and to assess how such targets affect host responses and survival by 632 influencing the innate immune system and other cellular processes. Thus, the DUB-negative rMERS-633 CoV can be an important tool to further explore CoV-host interactions. 634 In two of the mice that survived the DUB-negative rMERS-CoV infection, we could measure 635 neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. The third surviving mouse did, at this relatively early time . CC-BY 4.0 International license author/funder.

The observed variation might 637 be related to the course of infection, as the weight loss of this third mouse was the smallest of the 638 three mice that survived the infection (Fig 4C, mouse 1), suggesting that MERS-CoV infection was 639 milder than in the other two animals. It will be interesting to measure the acquired protection in the 640 DUB-negative MERS-CoV infected mice by challenging them with (lethal) MERS-CoV. Although more 641 in-depth characterization is necessary, the DUB-negative MERS-CoV may be a MLV vaccine candidate 642 that can induce antibody responses as well as T-cell responses, which both are important for 643 providing long-term effective protection against CoV infections (83-85). Interestingly, for MERS-CoV, 644 vaccines are currently being designed for use in humans as well as dromedary camels, the latter 645 aiming to reduce virus circulation and transmission to humans (84-86). 646 In summary, our results demonstrate, for the first time, that the presence of PL pro 's DUB 647 activity causes a delay in the innate immune response, which has a major impact on pathogenesis in 648 the mouse model used. Pathogenesis and lethality can thus be reduced by removal of the DUB 649 activity, resulting in earlier, better-regulated and therefore likely more effective innate immune 650 response that helps to clear the virus and decreases pathogenicity, despite the initial viral replication 651 being similar to that seen in wt virus infections. Our study has thus also provided the proof-of-652 concept for the in vivo attenuation of MERS-CoV, which provides a basis to advance the analysis of 653 the innate response as well as antibody and T-cell-mediated responses triggered by infection with 654 DUB-negative MERS-CoV. It creates the opportunity to apply this strategy to develop MLV vaccines 655 against MERS-CoV as well as other CoVs of societal or economic importance, such as porcine 656 epidemic diarrhoea virus, feline CoV, avian infectious bronchitis virus, and bovine CoV. Also in the 657 CoV field, the \"attenuation-by-design\" approach to eliminate one or more innate immune evasive 658 functions may offer a general and effective strategy for MLV development. .
