In the presently described cases, the tetrazole appears to be very minor. Consistent with the presence of the azido functionality, each neat C-2 azide displayed a prominent IR band at 2126-2130 cm \u22121 . A screen of conditions for the ligation of the azido nucleosides with alkynes showed that CuCl in t-BuOH/ H 2 O is optimal, yielding C-2 1,2,3-triazolyl nucleosides in 70-82% yields. Removal of the silyl groups with Et 3 N\u20223HF followed by deallylation with PhSO 2 Na/Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 gave the C-2 triazolylinosine nucleosides. In a continued demonstration of the versatility of O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)purine nucleosides, one C-2 triazolylinosine derivative was converted to two adenosine analogues via these intermediates, under mild conditions. Products were desilylated for biological assays. The two C-2 triazolyl adenosine analogues demonstrated pronounced antiproliferative activity in human ovarian and colorectal carcinoma cell cultures. When evaluated for antiviral activity against a broad spectrum of DNA and RNA viruses, some of the C-2 triazolylinosine derivatives showed modest inhibitory activity against cytomegalovirus.",

            "text": "The Cu-catalyzed version 1,2 of the classic Huisgen azide-alkyne cycloaddition 3-9 is a highly atom-economical reaction, often requiring mild conditions. Both factors render Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) highly attractive for the modification of complex and sensitive molecules such as nucleosides. We have recently reported a facile and general synthesis of C-6 azidopurine nucleosides and their use in CuAAC reactions, where some of these new compounds showed low cytostatic activity against ovarian carcinoma cell lines. 10 In general, azide-alkyne cycloaddition reactions have been a highly important transformation in the chemistry of nucleosides and DNA. [11] [12] [13] To our knowledge, our previous report on the CuAAC reactions of 6-azidopurine nucleosides was the first to describe such reactions at the C-6 position of purine nucleosides. 10 On the other hand, CuAAC chemistry involving C-2 azidopurine nucleosides has been reported in the context of adenosine A 3 receptor research 14 as well as in the development of antituberculosis agents, 15 and both describe reactions of 2-azidoadenosine analogues. In general, there are three methods for the synthesis of 2-azido adenosine derivatives. The first involves treatment of 6-amino-2-hydrazino ribofuranosylpurine with nitrous acid, 16 the second is a Cu-catalyzed azidation of tri-O-silyl 6-amino-2-iodo ribofuranosylpurine, 17 and the third involves diazotization/azidation of tri-O-acetyl 2amino-6-chlororibofuranosylpurine with isoamylONO/azidotrimethylsilane (TMS-N 3 ), followed by replacement of the chloride with an amino group. 18 For the current study, we were interested in the CuAAC reactions of 2-azidoinosine and its 2\u2032-deoxy analogue. Syntheses of 2-azidoinosine derivatives are less well developed in comparison to the adenosine analogues. Reaction of 2-chloroinosinic acid with NaN 3 has been shown to yield 2-azidoinosine-5\u2032-monophosphate, which was subsequently converted to 2-azidoinosine by reaction with acid phosphatase. 19 Similarly, 2-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyinosine, which requires relatively nontrivial synthesis, 20 has been converted to the 2-azido derivative within the context of a DNA oligomer. 21 For our purposes, we needed a simple, general access to 2-azidoinosine and 2-azido-2\u2032-deoxyinosine. In this paper we report the synthesis of suitable O 6 -protected 2-azidoinosine derivatives and their applicability toward CuAAC reactions. We have evaluated the anticancer and antiviral properties of C-2 (1,2,3triazol-1H-yl) inosine and 2\u2032-deoxyinosine analogues after appropriate deprotection protocols. We also report methodology for conversion of C-2 triazolylinosine derivatives to adenosine analogues via their O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl) derivatives, as well as the development of doubly reactive 2-azido-O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)purine ribonucleoside.",

            "text": "We have recently reported that O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)inosine and guanosine derivatives, as well as the corresponding 2\u2032-deoxy analogues, are exceptionally effective reagents for the introduction of substituents at the C-6 position of these purine nucleosides. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] On the basis of these results, we reasoned that O 6 -allylguanosine and 2\u2032-deoxyguanosine would be excellent precursors for the present work. 25 We have previously developed the synthesis of 2-chloro-3\u2032,5\u2032-di-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)-2\u2032-deoxyinosine from an O 6 -allyl-2\u2032deoxyguanosine precursor, 27 and as reported for 2-chloroinosinic acid, 19 this can potentially be used to generate the 2-azidoinosine derivative. Despite this, as shown in Scheme 1, it is more expeditious to directly install the azido group at the C-2 position by diazotization of the amino group in the presence of TMS-N 3 . 18 Silyl-protected O 6 -allyl-2-azidoinosine 2a(A) and the 2\u2032-deoxyinosine analogue 2b(A) could be synthesized via this procedure in ca. 60% yield. C-2 azido derivatives of purines 28, 29 and purine nucleosides 16, [30] [31] [32] [33] can exist in equilibrium with two possible tetrazolyl isomers. Similarly, 2a,b can exist as two tautomers termed 2a,b(T 1 ) and 2a,b(T 3 ), depending upon the nitrogen atom of the purine that is involved. Among the two azide derivatives, synthesis of 2b from the C-2 triflate has been reported in 26% yield, and this compound was reported not to display any tetrazole tautomer. 34 In our case, assessment by 1 H NMR indicated that both 2a and 2b exist predominantly as the azide 2a(A) and 2b(A) (\u2265 90% in CDCl 3 , acetone-d 6 , and DMSO-d 6 ) . Consistent with this, IR spectra of 2a and 2b showed absorptions at 2126 and 2130 cm \u22121 , respectively. By comparison, 2-azidoadenosine derivatives demonstrated 17-55% of the tetrazolyl isomer. 14, 15, 30, 31, 33 Apart from factors such as temperature and solvent polarity, 31, 33 the electronic nature of substituents also influences the azide/tetrazole ratio of purinyl derivatives. 33 Whereas electron-donating substituents favor the ring-closed tetrazolyl form, the azide form is preferred with electronwithdrawing groups. 33 The significantly greater proportion of the azido rather than the tetrazolyl forms of 2-azidoinosine derivatives 2a,b as compared to the 2-azidoadenosines is possibly linked to this substituent effect. Between the two tetrazolyl forms, the T 1 form is generally invoked for nucleosides. 14, 15, 32, 33 With the synthesis of the C-2 azido derivatives 2a,b completed, conditions for effectuating their ligation reactions with alkynes were evaluated (Table 1 ). In previous work with 6azidopurine nucleosides, we had observed that reduction of the azide to the amine was a competing process and that biphasic conditions were essential in order to obtain satisfactory azide-alkyne ligation. 10 Interestingly, application of those conditions here resulted in an unsatisfactory outcome (entry 1). Switching the solvent to 1:1 t-BuOH/H 2 O gave an improved result (entry 2). Cu(I) thiophene-2-carboxylate as the catalyst gave a modest improvement (entry 3), whereas CuCl proved to be the best under the conditions tested, affording a product yield of 82% (entry 4). Therefore, the generality of azide-alkyne ligation chemistry was next investigated using both the ribose derivative 2a as well as the 2\u2032-deoxy analogue 2b. Results from these experiments are summarized in Table 2 .",

Two possible sequences could be envisioned; either deprotection of the O 6 -allyl group followed by desilylation or vice versa. Desilylation by Et 3 N\u2022HF followed by deallylation was the preferred order. This is because we have noted that nucleoside desilylations with amine\u2022HF complexes can leave a fluoride contaminant in some instances, which can be difficult to eliminate. Hence, our chosen deprotection sequence offers the possibility to chromatographically purify the products of desilylation prior to deallylation. We also generally recommend checking products of desilylation by 19 F NMR. Several conditions were tested for this purpose: Pd 2 (dba) 3 /(\u00b1)-BINAP with morpholine in THF, Pd 2 (dba) 3 /(\u00b1)-BINAP with Et 2 NH 2 + HCO 3 \u2212 , in CH 2 Cl 2 , and Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 with sodium benzenesulfinate (PhSO 2 Na) in THF. The first two sets of conditions were not very successful, but use of Pd(PPh 3 ) 4 /PhSO 2 Na proved optimal. Scheme 2 shows the products prepared by deprotection.",

For this purpose, our previously described methodology for activation of the amide linkage, via the O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl) derivative, appeared to be a reasonable approach. 22, 25, 26 As shown in Scheme 3, deallylation of 3 followed by exposure of the resulting silylprotected C-2 triazolylinosine derivative to 1H-benzotriazol-1-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) and i-Pr 2 NEt in THF at room temperature led to the formation of the corresponding O 6 -(benzotriazolyl) derivative 31 in 55% yield. Reactions of 31 with morpholine and benzyl amine were conducted in 1,2dimethoxyethane (DME) to yield the adenosine derivatives 32 and 33 in 77% and 90% yields, respectively.

This in combination with chemistry leading to O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)purine nucleosides produces a powerful new approach to difunctionalization at C-2 and C-6 of the purine scaffold. At this point, we considered whether an appropriately functionalized, doubly reactive purine nucleoside derivative could be obtained. Therefore, the synthesis of a 2-azido-O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)purine nucleoside derivative was investigated. This would not only allow us to evaluate the stability of the benzotriazolyl moiety to the diazotization/azidation conditions but also provide a route to novel reactive nucleosides that can be difunctionalized at the C-2 and the C-6 positions of the purine. In this context, hydroxyl-protected O 6 -(benzotriazolyl)guanosine derivatives have been converted to the C-2 halo (F, Cl, and I) purine nucleosides. 35 We chose to diazotize O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)-2\u2032,3,5\u2032-tri-O-(tert-butyldimethylsilyl)guanosine (37) 25 with t-BuONO/ TMS-N 3 (Scheme 4), along the lines of previously published methods. 18, 31 This reaction gave a 49% unoptimized yield of 38 indicating the general stability of the O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl) group to the reaction conditions. The 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of 38 in CDCl 3 showed the presence of three isomers, presumably the azide and the two tetrazolyl forms (T 1 and T 3 ). For example, three singlets are observed in the 1 H NMR spectrum (\u03b4 8.63, 8.58, and 8.55 ppm) corresponding to the purinyl resonances. Although only two resonances are observed for H-1\u2032 (\u03b4 6.16 and 6.05 ppm), the HMQC spectrum clearly shows three C-1\u2032 resonances (\u03b4 89.61, 89.06, 88.99 ppm). The three H-2\u2032 resonances at \u03b4 4.58 (22%), 4.54 (42%), and 4.47 ppm (36%) ppm were used to determine the isomer ratio. At this time, no attempts have been made to assign structures to these isomers. The IR spectrum of 38 showed an absorption at 2128 cm \u22121 . Doubly reactive compounds, such as 38, with two preinstalled reactive entities can potentially be functionalized at the C-2 and the C-6 by CuAAC and S N Ar chemistry, respectively. Further work along these lines is forthcoming.",

Indeed, the inosine derivative 23 showed activity against CMV in human embryonic lung (HEL) cells at an EC 50 of 39-73 \u03bcM. None of the compounds showed antiviral activity against other viruses at subtoxic concentrations except the inosine derivative 17 that was endowed with moderate antivesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) activity (27 \u00b1 2.4 \u03bcM) in human cervix carcinoma HeLa cell cultures. This activity could not be confirmed in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblast cell cultures against the same virus, making the moderate activity rather cell-type specific. Yet, in the HeLa and HEL cell cultures toxicity of 17 was observed at 100-240 \u03bcM. This may also mean that the anti-VSV activity noticed for 17 in the VSV/HeLa cell assay can be due to underlying toxicity to the host cells, rather than to a specific antiviral activity of the compound.

In the series, adenosine derivative 34 emerged as the most interesting cytostatic candidate showing activity against 1A9, 1A9-PTX22, HCT116, and HCT116 p53 knockout cells.",

In contrast to the C-6 azidopurine nucleosides, these C-2 azides do not exhibit significant azide\u2022tetrazole equilibrium, and the azido form appears to predominate. In comparison, C-2 azidoadenosine analogues show a greater proportion of the tetrazolyl form. This is possibly linked to the greater electronwithdrawing allyloxy group at the C-6 position in the present cases. The products from the CuAAC reactions were desilylated and evaluated for their potential antiviral activity. Unfortunately, none of the compounds proved antivirally active at subtoxic concentrations with the exception of compound 17 that was endowed with a moderate inhibitory activity against vesicular stomatitis virus and compound 23, which showed activity against cytomegalovirus. It is, however, currently unclear whether the anti-VSV activity is a specific antiviral effect or due to underlying compound toxicity.",

S N Ar substitution of the benzotriazolyloxy group with amines then furnished C-2 triazolyl adenosine analogues. In addition, we have converted silyl-protected O 6 -(benzotriazol-1Hyl)guanosine to a doubly reactive 2-azido-O 6 -(benzotriazol-1H-yl)purine nucleoside derivative. Interestingly, based upon the NMR results, this compound appears to exist as the azide and two tetrazolyl isomers. This nucleoside derivative, which can react at the C-2 via CuAAC and at the C-6 via S N Ar, should find broad utility in greatly diversifying the purine nucleoside scaffold via generally simple operational procedures.",
