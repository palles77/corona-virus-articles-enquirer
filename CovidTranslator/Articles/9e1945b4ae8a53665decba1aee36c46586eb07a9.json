Formal, integrated global health programs within pulmonary and critical care fellowships are relatively new but are built on principles and ideals of global health that focus on the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and social justice. Although core competencies consistent with these overarching themes in global health education have not been formalized for pulmonary and critical care trainees, relevant competency areas include clinical knowledge, international research training, cultural competency, and clinical and research capacity building. Existing global health education in U.S. pulmonary and critical care medicine training programs can generally be classified as one of three different models: integrated global health tracks, global health electives, and additional research years. Successful global health education programs foster partnerships and collaborations with international sites that emphasize bidirectional exchange. This bidirectional exchange includes ongoing, equitable commitments to mutual opportunities for training and professional development, including a focus on the particular knowledge and skill sets critical for addressing the unique priorities of individual countries. However, barriers related to the availability of mentorship, funding, and dedicated time exist to expanding global health education in pulmonary and critical care medicine. The implementation of global health training within pulmonary and critical care medicine programs requires continued optimization, but this training is essential to prepare the next generation of physicians to address the global aspects of respiratory disease and critical illness.",

There are several reasons for this. First, the focus on global health reflects a wave of social justice activism among students (4) . Second, trends in globalization and mass migration highlight the importance of understanding global epidemiologic, geographic, cultural, social, and economic determinants of disease (5) . Third, recent infectious disease epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS, 2002) , H1N1 influenza (2009), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV, 2012), Ebola (2014), and Zika virus (2016), vividly demonstrate the implausibility of medical isolationism. Fourth, global health training opportunities afford tangible benefits in physician knowledge, skills, and attitudes in caring for diverse patient populations (6) . Global health is especially important in pulmonary and critical care medicine (PCCM) fellowship training, as respiratory and critical illness contribute tremendously to the global burden of disease (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) .",

The PCCM global health pathway leverages these longstanding collaborations in Kenya to conduct studies of chronic lung diseases and air pollution, in line with the Kenya Ministry of Health strategic plan to curb noncommunicable disease burden (26) .

National and international organizations can also facilitate bidirectional academic exchanges between U.S. PCCM training institutions and others worldwide. Careers in global health encompass a broad spectrum of clinical, research, and educational opportunities within the emerging, multidisciplinary model of the field. Global health training should be a relevant focus of PCCM training programs, and where infrastructure and international relationships do not already exist, crossinstitutional and/or interdisciplinary collaborations can be harnessed to bridge gaps.",

            "text": "Global Health Electives Several U.S. PCCM programs offer structured, recurrent global health electives during fellowship at established international sites. For example, Columbia University and Black Lion Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia have partnered to develop a 2-year pulmonary training program for Ethiopian physicians, led by faculty from the Divisions of PCCM at Columbia University and Brown University. Teaching and mentorship are provided by visiting American and European faculty, who also supervise Columbia PCCM fellows during clinical rotations in Addis Ababa. PERSPECTIVE global health. These rotations can include tuberculosis, asylum, or travel clinics as well as site visits to local nonprofit organizations, which can provide exposure to tropical diseases, global health systems, and cross-cultural exchange. Many U.S. PCCM programs offer additional research training years beyond the 3 years required by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, typically contingent on securing independent funding through institutional, foundation, or federal funding mechanisms, that can be used to undertake global health research. Similar to United States-based fellowship research, these opportunities require senior mentors with established collaborations and projects. Fellows are offered uninterrupted time at the international site to develop professional relationships and work with local collaborators in research development and implementation. Advanced training in research methodology is often pursued, leveraging important intrainstitutional collaborations with global health programs at Schools of Public Health; the aforementioned programs, Johns Hopkins University, and Harvard-affiliated programs, to name a few, provide trainees with these opportunities. Additional research years allow PCCM trainees to structure global health educational and research experiences to best suit future career plans. Respiratory and critical care societies have also taken up the mantle of global health. For instance, the American Thoracic Society has developed the Methods in Epidemiologic, Clinical and Operations Research (MECOR) and Global Scholars Programs, initiatives that focus on research and clinical training of physicians and other health care professionals from low-and middle-income countries to build clinical and research capacity and develop leadership(27)(28)(29). These platforms can connect U.S. PCCM trainees with colleagues from around the world to create opportunities for bidirectional educational, clinical, and research collaborations and peer mentoring.",
