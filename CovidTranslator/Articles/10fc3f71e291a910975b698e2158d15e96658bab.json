SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (17.5% acrylamide) of fractions from purification of the neck domain by affinity chromatography on immobilized nickel. FT, flow through. SDS-polyacrylamide gels were performed by the method of Laemmli. Expression plasmids for the extracellular domain fragments of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR 1 were altered by truncation at BsmF1 and BbsI sites, respectively, and appending of double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) to encode a glycine residue followed by histidine tags: cctgggtcatcaccatcaccatcactag for 6histidine tag on DC-SIGN, cctgggtcatcactag for 2-histidine tag on DC-SIGN, and catttgaacgcctgggtcatcactag for 2-histidine tag on DC-SIGNR. The truncated cDNAs were inserted into vector T5T 2 and transferred to Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). Protein was expressed by growing 1 liter of transformed bacteria in Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 \u03bcg/ml ampicillin at 37 \u00b0C to OD 550 of 0.8 before induction with isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactoside at a concentration of 100 \u03bcg/l. After incubation for a further 2.5 h at 37 \u00b0C, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 xg in a Beckman JLA 8.1000 rotor and were washed once with 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8 and stored frozen. Frozen pellets were suspended in 0.5 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8 and 20 mM imidazole and sonicated 4 times in 30 s bursts using the large probe of a Branson 250 sonicator, with 15 min cooling on ice between bursts. The suspension was then centrifuged 15 min at 15,000 xg in a Beckman JA20 rotor and then for 30 min at 200,000 xg in a Beckman Ti55.2 rotor. The final supernatant was applied to a 2ml column of fast flow chelating Sepharose (GE Healthcare) charged with nickel following the manufacturer's instructions. The column was washed with 10 ml of NI buffer (0.5 M NaCl and 25 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8) containing 20 mM imidazole and eluted with 6 aliquots of 1 ml of N1 buffer containing 20 mM, 100 mM and 200 mM imidazole. In some cases, further elution was performed with N1 buffer containing 10 mM EDTA. Aliquots of fractions were examined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Further purification was achieved by dialysis against 50 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, and purification on a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare) in the same buffer with a gradient of 0 to 500 mM NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min over 20 min.",
