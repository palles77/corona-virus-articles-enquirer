Suspected cases were detected through fever screening, medical inspection, self-declaration, and reporting by on-board staff. Participants completed a standardised questionnaire with questions about demographics, their travel itinerary (including detailed information about all countries or regions visited), and clinical manifestations. Nasopharyngeal swabs, sputum samples, faecal samples, vomitus, blood, and serum were collected as appropriate for diagnoses. Diagnosis was made by specific laboratory tests according to the national technical guidelines. Infections were classified as respiratory, gastrointestinal, vector-borne, blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted, or mucocutaneous. We divided arriving travellers into two groups: travellers coming from countries other than China, and travellers coming from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. We integrated surveillance data for 2014-16, calculated incidences of travel-related infections, and compared the frequency of infections among subgroups.",

Both the overall number and incidence of infection were more than five times higher in 2016 than in 2014. Case numbers and incidences also varied substantially by province, autonomous region, and municipality. Overall, 17 643 (77%) infections were detected by fever screening, but 753 (49%) blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were identified through medical inspection. 14 305 (73%) cases of respiratory infection and 96 (51%) of gastrointestinal infections were in tourists. Tuberculosis, hepatitis A virus, vector-borne, and blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections were common among Chinese labourers who worked abroad. Dengue and malaria were most commonly diagnosed in travellers arriving from Africa. 12 126 (93%) of the 12 985 cases arriving from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan were respiratory infections. Hand, foot, and mouth disease accounted for 2\u00b790% of infections in travellers from Hong Kong, Macau, or Taiwan and 0\u00b731% of infections in international travellers.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] Timely identification of infections among arriving travellers can help to alert the medical and public health communities of outbreak threats before they affect the general population of that country. Surveillance of travel-related infections is important for global public health as international travel continues to increase worldwide. 6, 7 China has become the world's fourth most popular destination in terms of arrivals, with 57 million tourists in 2015, 1 and has inevitably been affected by travelrelated infections. Malaria and dengue have been introduced by arriving travellers from countries where those diseases are endemic. [8] [9] [10] An outbreak of Chikungunya virus caused by infected travellers has been recorded in main land China, 11 and Zika virus, yellow fever, and Rift Valley fever have all been imported within the past 8 years. [12] [13] [14] [15] In response to the increasing risk of imported infections, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine of the People's Republic of China (AQSIQ) obliged all air and surface ports to do active surveillance of infections among arriving travellers. Systematic surveillance began in 2014 to reduce risk of autochthonous transmission and help to inform evidence-based advice for travellers. We integrated the data from all entry-exit ports in mainland China to characterise travel-related infections, define the demographic features of imported cases, identify risk groups and exposure countries or regions, and assess the effectiveness of surveillance for further improvement.",

We also gathered data for the total number of people arriving in each of the 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, and four municipalities of mainland China. All patient data were anonymised. Because this study constituted public health surveillance rather than research in human beings, ethical approval from institutional review boards was not required. Participants or their guardians provided written informed consent for collection of biological samples (appendix p 4). People who were suspected of having an infection but who did not consent to collection of samples were made known to local centres for disease control and prevention for potential further follow-up.",

Several identified studies were about the epidemiological features of imported malaria or about febrile illnesses or HIV infection at one port of China. We did not find any studies of active surveillance for various infections among arriving travellers at all entry-exit ports throughout mainland China.",

We characterised the range of travel-related infections, and showed how they varied by traveller type, exposure country or region, and province of arrival to mainland China. Our findings, which are based on surveillance data for 45 infections among 22 797 travellers who arrived at the 272 entry-exit ports to the mainland, are helpful for increasing public health awareness about the potential risk of imported infections. Most previous studies about this topic in mainland China explored the epidemiological features of imported malaria, or febrile illnesses or HIV infection at a single entry-exit port. 8, 9, [19] [20] [21] [22] By comparison with GeoSentinel, a clinician-based global surveillance system that tracks infectious diseases and other adverse health outcomes related to travel, 23 we actively surveyed infections among travellers upon arrival in mainland China. This method enabled us not only to profile imported infections, identify risk groups, and formulate optimum advice for travellers (as done previously on the basis of data from GeoSentinel or its linked European surveillance network, EuroTravNet), [24] [25] [26] but also to estimate the incidence of each infection by using the total number of arrivals as denominator. Additionally, active surveillance of arriving travellers enables timely identification of imported infections, allowing for alerting of public health authorities of threats before autochthonous transmission.",

We could not establish where these travellers were infected, because they usually travel frequently to and from mainland China. Detailed data about itineraries should be collected to help to clarify the infection exposure site. The warm and humid climate in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and southern China could favour transmission of hand, foot, and mouth disease. Fortunately, a vaccine against the EV71, the most prevalent virus strain, is commercially available and has a good protective effect. 35 We mapped travel-related infections globally to show differences in terms of exposure country and region ( figure 4) . Health-care professionals should be aware of the specific risks to travellers, and should provide targeted pre-travel consultations. Accordingly, countryspecific or region-specific vaccination and prophylaxis are strongly recommended to reduce the burden of travel-related infections.",

Because our findings were based on surveillance of travellers when entering mainland China, most cases had clinical manifestations of disease upon arrival (appendix pp 9-10). Patients who were infected but did not develop symptoms until after arrival were not included in our study. Thus, the frequency of travel-related infections are underestimated. By contrast, for infections such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C virus infections, HIV, and syphilis, which have long latent or incubation periods, the location of acquisition is difficult to establish. For example, Chinese citizens who travelled overseas and were diagnosed upon arrival back to mainland China could have acquired the infection before travelling. Thus, the frequency of such infection in arriving travellers could have been overestimated. Although we estimated the overall incidence of each infection, would could not calculate the numerical risk for travellers coming from a particular country or region because of the lack of denominator data. Furthermore, we could not compare the demographic characteristics of the 22 797 people with an infection to those without an infection, because demographic data were not collected for all arriving travellers.",

Between 2014 and 2016, an almost six-times increase in the number of infections was noted, whereas a five-times increase in incidence of infections was recorded(table).The number of cases imported varied greatly by province and region. Most infected people presented in coastal provinces of eastern and southeastern China, including Shanghai municipality, Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. Large numbers of cases also presented in Yunnan in southern China, which has a long inland border with other countries (figure 1A). Incidence was highest in Qinghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces (figure 1B). The five types of infections were diagnosed in substantially different proportions in different provinces. Nearly all people diagnosed in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region and slightly more than half those diagnosed in Yunnan province and Guangxi autonomous region had blood-transmitted and sex-transmitted infections (figure 1A). 142 (98%) of the 145 cases imported to Beijing were vector-borne infections.",

Cases of pneumococcal infection; acute diarrhoea including bacillary dysentery, typhoid, and paratyphoid; and vector-borne infections were detected mainly at airports, whereas most cases of chickenpox, rubella, herpes zoster virus infection, and acute conjunctivitis were identified at water ports (figure 2D).",
