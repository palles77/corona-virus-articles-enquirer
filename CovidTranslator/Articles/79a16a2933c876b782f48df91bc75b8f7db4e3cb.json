Cow-calf pairs were assigned randomly to treatment with 2 replications (pasture) per year for 3 yr. Treatments were (1) recommended stocking rate of 9.46 animal-unit month/ha with no supplementation (CON) or (2) double the recommended stocking rate (18.9 animal-unit month/ ha) and supplemented with a 30:70 modified distillers grains plus solubles: cornstalks (DM) mixture (SUPP). To replace 50% of grazed forage DMI, SUPP pairs were fed an average of 1.13% of BW (DM) over the grazing season. Pairs grazed adjacent smooth bromegrass pastures for 130 d during the summer. Gain was not different (P = 0.19) between SUPP and CON cows (0.28 vs. 0.19 kg/d, respectively). Ending cow BW was not affected (P = 0.46) by treatment. Similarly, calf gain was not affected (P = 0.31) by supplementation. In studies where confined cow-calf pairs were fed average-quality (IVDMD = 52.9%) forage, DMI was 2.58% of pair BW. Based on these data, CON and SUPP pairs consumed 18.6 and 19.1 kg of DM, respectively, of total feed per pair daily. The SUPP pairs consumed 7.1 kg of DM/pair daily of the supplement, replacing approximately 35% of grazed forage intake. These data suggest mixtures of ethanol co-products and lowquality forages can be supplemented to replace grazed forage intake of cattle, allowing for increased stocking rate without affecting animal performance.",

            "text": "Across the Midwest, pasture for beef production systems has become scarce and high priced as grain crop production has expanded (Wright and Wimberly, 2013) . Concurrently, crop residues (Ward, 1978; Watson et al., 2015) and corn co-products from ethanol production (Klopfenstein et al., 2008) represent feed resources for beef production that are becoming more abundant, and opportunities to expand their use remain. Investigating alternative management strategies to increase pasture stocking rate and maintain beef production on finite resources is warranted. A practical approach to increase stocking rate may be to replace a portion of the grazed forage by supplementing low-quality crop residues mixed with co-products. Theoretically, replacing approximately 50% of the grazed forage with supplemental feed would support a 2-fold increase in stocking rate. Therefore, the objectives of this multiyear experiment were to evaluate the effects of supplementing modified distillers grains plus solubles (MDGS) mixed with low-quality crop residues to cow-calf pairs grazing smooth bromegrass pastures on (1) cow and calf performance and (2) production economics.",

Multiparous (8.9 \u00b1 4 yr of age), nonpregnant, crossbred (Simmental \u00d7 Angus), lactating beef cows with springborn calves at side were used in a 3-yr experiment conducted on smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis) pastures at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Agricultural Research and Development Center located near Mead, Nebraska (41\u00b013\u2032N, 96\u00b029\u2032W; elevation 369 m). In a completely randomized design, cow-calf pairs (n = 16 per year; 4 per pasture) were stratified by total pair BW and assigned randomly within strata to 1 of 2 treatments with 2 replications (pasture) per treatment each year. Across all 3 yr there were a total of 48 cow-calf pairs grazing 12 pasture replicates; data were collected on 16 pairs grazing 4 pastures each year. Treatments consisted of pastures stocked at (1) the recommended stocking rate of 9.46 animal-unit month (AUM)/ha without supplementation (CON) or (2) double the recommended stocking rate (18.9 AUM/ha) with supplementation (SUPP). Pastures were 2.8 and 1.4 ha, respectively. Pastures were fertilized with 90 kg of N/ ha in the spring before the onset of the experiment. Pairs were stocked continuously on smooth bromegrass pastures from early May until mid September annually (130 d).",

Ground cornstalks were chosen as a supplement ingredient to provide rumen fill, and MDGS was added at a minimal level necessary to encourage consumption of the low-quality forage. Based on data with confined cow-calf pairs fed average-quality forage (IVDMD = 53%; Meyer et al., 2012) , predicted total forage DMI was calculated as 2.58% of average pair BW throughout the grazing period. Therefore, total estimated DMI was calculated retrospectively based on average pair BW for each treatment. It was anticipated grazed forage intake would be greatest early in the grazing season and decline with seasonal advancement. As a result, pairs were supplemented at 0.6% of BW (DM) at experiment initiation with increasing levels throughout the season on a weekly basis to account for (1) declining grazed forage quality and quantity and (2) increasing consumption by the calf. To encourage pairs to begin consuming the supplement, a 50:50 ratio of MDGS to cornstalks (DM) was initially fed, with cornstalks increasing and MDGS decreasing by 2 percentage unit increments daily until the 30:70 ratio was obtained (10 d). Before the beginning of the experiment, large-round cornstalk bales were ground (Mighty Giant; Jones Manufacturing Co., Beemer, NE) to pass through a 2.54-cm screen. Ground cornstalks and MDGS were stored separately in a partially enclosed commodity bay with concrete flooring before feeding. The supplement was mixed fresh daily using a truck-mounted feed mixer (Roto-Mix, Dodge City, KS), and water was added to reduce the DM content to 30% to enhance palatability and prevent sorting.",

The analysis was completed to model a 200-pair cow-calf enterprise located in eastern Nebraska with the primary assumption that pasture for summer grazing was available for one half (100 pairs) of the cowherd. With limited resources, grazing additional rented pasture sufficient for the remaining 100 pairs or double stocking and providing supplement during the summer grazing season were options considered. For the budget analysis, it was assumed that there would be no decrease or increase in net income between management options because performance and herd inventory would remain unchanged.

Freight expense for shipping cattle to and from pastures was calculated at $2.48/km ($4.00/loaded mile) assuming 3 semitruck loads for 100 pairs. It was assumed that pasture for 100 pairs could be rented 16.1 km (10 miles) away. Feed costs were compiled using data from weekly published feed price reports (USDA-AMS, 2015). Calculated cost for grinding baled cornstalk residue was $12.00/907 kg. Feed needs included a 5% shrink for MDGS and 10% for cornstalks. Yardage expense associated with checking and maintaining fence and caring for cattle was charged at $0.10/pair daily for CON cattle on pasture and $0.20/pair daily for SUPP cattle on pasture to account for increased equipment costs of mixing and delivering the feed. However, equipment necessary for feeding was considered already owned by the enterprise. It was assumed that supplement would be fed in a bunk. Allowing for 0.9 m of linear bunk space for each cow-calf pair requires 50 bunks that are 3.6 m in length. Therefore, bunk costs were included with a total one-time cost of $20,000 (50 bunks at $400/bunk) but were prorated across their assumed lifetime of 10 yr. Additional costs associated with breeding and salt-mineral supplementation were not different between management systems and, thus, were not included in the analysis.",

Cows double stocked and supplemented with a 30:70 ratio (DM) of wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) and wheat straw tended to have greater ADG compared with those grazing at a recommended stocking rate in similar work on upland native Sandhills range (Nuttelman et al., 2010) . Interestingly, calf performance was not affected by supplementation. In a different experiment by the same authors, both cow and calf ADG were improved by feeding a 45:55 ratio of WDGS and grass hay to double stocked pairs. The researchers attributed the improvement in calf ADG to increased milk production by the dam due to intake of a high quality feed, direct consumption of the supplement by the calves, or a combination of both factors (Nuttelman et al., 2010) . Also in agreement, nonpregnant, nonlactating cows grazing smooth bromegrass had numerically greater ADG when double stocked and supplemented with a 35:65 blend of Golden Synergy (40% wet corn gluten feed and 60% MDGS; Archer Daniels Midland Company, Columbus, NE) and wheat straw (Doerr et al., 2012) . Likewise, ADG of yearling steers grazing upland native Sandhills range at twice the recommended stocking rate was improved by supplementing a mixture of 60% forage (wheat straw or grass hay) and 40% WDGS (DM basis; Villasanti et al., 2011) . The supplementation rate in the current experiment was designed to replace grazed forage intake rather than improve performance. The small numerical increase in performance by SUPP pairs is logical, given the supplement would contain more energy than the grass it replaced. Data from Watson et al. (2012) indicated IVDMD of smooth bromegrass diet samples decreased from almost 69% in May to 51% in September, averaging approximately 59%. This is slightly lower than the 63% TDN content of the supplement in the current experiment.",

Therefore, the supplemented pairs consumed about 3 times more RUP than the control cattle, 522 g/d compared with 171 g/d, respectively.

            "text": "Across all 3 yr, average total pair BW was 722 and 737 kg for CON and SUPP pairs, respectively. Based on these BW and data from Meyer et al. (2012) , total estimated DMI was calculated to be 18.6 and 19.1 kg/pair daily for CON and SUPP, respectively. For SUPP pairs, supplement intake averaged 7.1 kg of DM/d throughout the season. By difference, grazed forage intake was calculated as 12.0 kg/d. This suggests the supplement reduced grazed forage intake by 35%, and 0.93 kg of grazed forage was replaced by every 1 kg of supplement fed. It was assumed that stocking rate changes between the SUPP and CON treatments did not affect intake, although this was not directly measured. Similar research conducted in the Sandhills (Nuttelman et al., 2010) with cow-calf pairs demonstrated grazed forage replacement values of approximately 40 to 50% when a 30:70 ratio (DM basis) of WDGS and wheat straw was fed. Daily forage disappearance per cowcalf pair was not influenced by supplementation of a 45:55 ratio of WDGS and grass hay in other work by Nuttelman et al. (2010) . Doerr et al. (2012) noted that a blend of 35% by-product and 65% wheat straw (DM) decreased smooth brome intake by 48%. Range forage intake of double stocked yearling steers was reduced 44 to 54% by feeding a low-quality forage and WDGS (Villasanti et al., 2011) . However, supplement characteristics appear to be important in determining substitution effects on forage intake. Grazed forage intake was not reduced when yearling steers were supplemented only dried distillers grains plus solubles in studies by Gustad et al. (2008) and Stalker et al. (2012) . Although previous work (MacDonald et al., 2007; Griffin et al., 2012) has suggested a substitution effect on forage intake when distillers grains are fed in forage-based diets, reductions in forage intake have not been great enough to allow for a 2-fold increase in stocking rate . This indicates using fibrous low-quality forages in the supplement is essential to reducing voluntary grazed forage DMI and achieving significant forage replacement rates. This concurs with the well-established concept that intake of forage-fed cattle is regulated by rumen fill and digesta passage (NASEM, 2016). Table 2 reports rainfall and forage production in pastures adjacent to the pastures used in the current experiment. Production in 2012 was lower than 2011 and 2013 because of limited rainfall. Based on the estimated forage intakes, harvest efficiency in the control pastures ranged from 28.7 to 49.2% across years. Calculated harvest efficiency was numerically greater in the SUPP pastures, ranging from 36.2 to 64.3%. Visual observation suggested that the pairs used the SUPP pastures to a greater degree early in the grazing season and depended more on the supplemental feed later in the season. This greater utilization early in the season maintained the brome in a more vegetative state throughout the grazing season. Because the grazing pattern was different and harvest efficiency was greater with the SUPP treatment, subsequent forage production was of interest. Forage production was measured the year following this experiment to determine the effects of 5 yr of the CON and SUPP treatments being applied to these pastures. Forage production measured on July 10, 2014, was 9,312 kg/ ha for the CON pasture and 10,558 kg/ha for the SUPP pasture. We conclude that the grazing pattern and higher harvest efficiency in the SUPP treatment actually had a positive effect on the pastures. A partial explanation for increased forage production in the SUPP pastures might be added N from the supplement. The supplemented feed contained 2% N and supplied 18.5 kg of N/pair during the grazing season. At 19% protein in the gain (NASEM, 2016) , the calves removed about 4.3 kg of N and the cows would have removed about 0.10 kg of N/yr. Assuming one half the gain came from the supplemental feed, then about 2.2 kg of N was removed by a pair. The net excretion would be 16.3 kg of N/pair or 23 kg of N/ha. This may explain the greater forage production in 2014 because of carryover of N deposited by the pairs during the previous 3 yr. It also suggests that forage production in the SUPP treatment pastures during this experiment may have been greater than that in the control pastures.",

Cows were maintained on dormant smooth bromegrass pastures and received ad libitum access to alfalfa (Medicago sativa) and smooth bromegrass hay during calving. Mean calving dates were March 13, March 25, and March 25 for calves born in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively. Cows were vaccinated approximately 1 mo before calving against bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens type C (Scour Bos 9; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN).Within 24 h of parturition, calving date, calf birth weight, and sex were recorded, and male progeny were band castrated. Approximately 3 wk before initiation of the experiment, all calves were vaccinated against Clostridium chauvoei, Clostridium septicum, Clostridium novyi, Clostridium sordellii, C. perfringens types C and D (Ultrabac 7; Zoetis Inc., New York, NY), and cows and calves were transported from the Dalbey-Halleck Research Unit to Agricultural Research and Development Center (approximately 121 km). Cows were marketed upon completion of the experiment each year. Thus, different cows were used for treatments each year.",
