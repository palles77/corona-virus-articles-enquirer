            "text": "as separate units and the evident links between them are frequently ignored in most of the developing countries including Iran. Although it has been a while since the World Health Organization (WHO) promoted the concept of Intersectoral Action for Health (IAH) as \"a recognised relationship between part or parts of the health sector with parts of another sector which has been formed to take action on an issue to achieve health outcomes (or intermediate health outcomes) in a way that is more effective, efficient or sustainable than could be achieved by the health sector acting alone\", this strategy is not yet operationalized in developing countries, including Iran (8). Another widely known but neglected concept could be the Health in All Policies (HiAP) which is \"an approach to public policies across sectors that systematically takes into account the health and health systems implications of decisions, seeks synergies and avoids harmful health impacts, in order to improve population health and health equity\" (9) . Both these overlooked concepts highlight the importance of taking the 'One Health' approach in improving the overall health of our communities. In Iran or similar settings, while the Ministry of Health needs inputs from several other sectors such as Ministry of Agriculture -which is in charge of the Iranian Veterinary Organizationand Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, those sectors may not be willing to or even required to share such a responsibility to improve health. Conversely, at the end of the day, it is the health sector that is mainly expected to provide health for the general public. Overall, we need to adopt an integrated and holistic approach when it comes to health and prevention of threats from crossing fields. It is now time to introduce the 'One Health' approach to the curriculum of the medical, veterinary, and public health schools throughout the country. Nonetheless, this strategic need requires proper vision and leadership. Such recommendations can only be implemented with the support of all governmental related sectors. In other words, the responsibility of taking the action sits on the shoulders of multiple sectors in the government and is not limited to healthcare professionals and health policy-makers. It is time to set off intersectoral studies to help develop best practices and appropriate models for the context of Iran. All related sectors in the government should decide on their future role in approaching 'One Health' and help reach the best possible health for our people, animals, and environment.",
