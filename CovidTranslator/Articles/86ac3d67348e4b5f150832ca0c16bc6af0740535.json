            "text": "Singapore is a cosmopolitan city at the crossroads of Asia, with a land area of 644 km 2 and a population of 4 million. The emergency ambulance service (EAS) is run by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and has a fleet of 30 ambulances. It is a single-tier system, which serves the whole country and handles approximately 75,000 calls annually. 1, 2 The paramedics on the EAS perform basic life support skills and are trained to defibrillate with the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs). They also start intravenous lines and administer certain drugs (e.g., adrenaline, dextrose). The complete ambulance crew comprises of a driver (trained in first aid and basic life support), a qualified paramedic, and a paramedic assistant who is a trained medical orderly. In response to road traffic accidents and certain medical emergencies such as cardiac arrest, a first line of response is dispatched before the ambulances. This represents the fast response paramedics (FRPs). They are paramedics with the same qualifications as the ambulance paramedics but they have in addition to this, training in riding motorcycles, which includes defensive riding. They carry an AED as well as essential first-response equipment on their motorcycles. These FRPs work alone and will usually hand over the cases they have attended to the ambulance paramedics for transport and further management. 1 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a form of atypical pneumonia, which was first seen in November 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China. It is a newly emerging and highly infectious disease with a high rate of transmission, especially among health care workers. As the world has become a ''global village,'' SARS has become a problem of the ''village.'' The SARS outbreak in Singapore begun in March 2003 and was traced to a traveler returning from Hong Kong. 3 Since then, several index cases and their clusters have been identified and traced. The social and economic impact of SARS has been tremendous. Up to June 20, 2003, there have been a total of 206 cases and 32 deaths (15.5%) in Singapore.",

The coordinated efforts of the SCDF with the Ministry of Health were extremely important in this respect. Mandatory steps from the preparatory phase to the initial point of contact and subsequent disposition of patients were highlighted and taught to all personnel. The best strategy was to have a high index of suspicion and be vigilant at all times for every patient. Prevention is best in the management of any infectious disease and, hence, for SARS, it behooves the system to prevent its spread. Because it would take up to one week before a diagnosis of SARS could be confirmed, universal precautions had to be undertaken for every patient being treated. This entails the adoption of full protection for every ambulance crewmember. To date, a total of seven probable and five suspected cases were conveyed by the EAS out of a total of 204 patients with SARS-like signs and symptoms.",

This format can illustrate specific medical entities, unusual approaches to field management, or complex administrative issues that a field scenario may present. Authors should pay particular attention to the educational value of the manuscript, and avoid a purely descriptive approach. Features such as a team approach and innovative solutions to atypical problems should be stressed. While an abstract and specific section headings are not required, the following sections should be considered:1. overall description of the scene, types of responding agencies and personnel, etc. 2. specific challenges encountered 3. solutions developed to address the challenges 4. discussion of medical issues involved, with review of the literature where appropriate 5. discussion of logistic and administrative issues Title page, group authorship and acknowledgments page, references, and tables and figures (where appropriate) should follow the same format as for general manuscripts (see the ''Manuscript Preparation'' section of the ''Instructions for Authors'' following the text of most issues of Prehospital Emergency Care).",
