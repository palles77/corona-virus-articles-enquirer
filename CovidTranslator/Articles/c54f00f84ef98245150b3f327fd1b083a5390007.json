These new phenanthridone alkaloid analogues were obtained in both racemic and optically active forms. High enantioselectivities (up to 99% ee) were achieved by applying (8S,9S)-9amino(9-deoxy)epiquinine as an organocatalyst. Due to a side reaction, various methoxyphenanthridine regioisomers were also prepared which afforded further synthetic trans-dihydronarciclasine analogues modified in the ring A of the phenanthridone scaffold.",

            "text": "Nowadays, hundreds of members of alkaloids are known, which have been isolated from the plants of Amaryllidaceae family. After recognising their anticancerous properties, more and more attention has been paid to their isolation and structural elucidation [1] . The alkaloids prepared from this plant family are divided into 12 groups according to their ring systems [2] . Among these diverse structures, the most potent antitumorous alkaloids can be found in the phenanthridone subgroup. Surprisingly, the detailed investigations of Amaryllidaceae alkaloids started only at the end of the nineteenth century, when Gerrard isolated lycorine (1, Fig. 1 pseudonarcissus in 1877 [3, 4] . Since then, several alkaloids have been obtained from various Amaryllidaceae plants including trans-dihydronarciclasine (2, Fig. 1 ) isolated by Pettit and co-workers from Zephyranthes candida in 1990 [5] . Compound 2 is the most potent natural anticancerous alkaloid among the Amaryllidaceae ones according to the data from National Cancer Institute (NCI, USA) [6] . Its 7-deoxy analogue (3, Fig. 1 ) was also isolated by Pettit and co-workers from Hymenocallis caribaea and Hymenocallis latifolia, in pure form, but its biological activity was found to be weaker than that of 2 [6] . This can be explained by the lack of hydroxyl group at the position A-7, similarly to the comparison of other representatives, such as pancratistatin (4) and 7-deoxypancratistatin (5) or narciclasine (6) and lycoricidine (7) (Fig. 1 ) [6] . Further structure-activity relationship studies have intensively been made to find more effective synthetic analogues, but the modifications rather touched the ring C of the phenanthridone skeleton [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] than its ring A [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

It has also inhibitory effects against reverse transcriptase enzyme in the HIV-1 virus [32] . Besides, strong antiviral activities of some phenanthridone alkaloids including compounds 4, 6, and 7 were reported by Gabrielsen and coworkers [33, 34] .

The dihydrobenzodioxine ring was formed with 1,2-dibromoethane in DMF, in the presence of K 2 CO 3 [44] to afford 2,3-dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxine-6-carbaldehyde (16) and 8-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxine-6-carbaldehyde (17) in good yield (63%). In the next step, acetone was condensed with these benzaldehyde derivatives 16 and 17 in the Claisen-Schmidt reaction applying a high excess of acetone in water and basic conditions (NaOH) to give 4-(2,3-dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxin-6-yl)but-3-en-2-one (18) and 4-(8-methoxy-2,3-dihydrobenzo[b] [1, 4] dioxin-6yl)but-3-en-2-one (19) in good yields (83 and 62%, respectively).

The structures of these regioisomers were distinguished by the chemical shifts of 5 0 -H Ar and 5 0 -C Ar of (\u00b1)-48, as well as 7 0 -H Ar and 7 0 -C Ar of (\u00b1)-49, because there were significant differences between the positions of these peaks both in the 1 H NMR (6.72 ppm for 5 0 -H Ar and 6.54 ppm for 7 0 -H Ar ) and 13 C NMR spectra (110.8 ppm for 5 0 -C Ar and 102.0 ppm for 7 0 -C Ar ). These diversions were due to the anisotropic shielding effect of the adjacent methoxy group in compound (\u00b1)-49, which resulted in lower chemical shifts for those aromatic hydrogen and carbon atoms at position A-7.",
