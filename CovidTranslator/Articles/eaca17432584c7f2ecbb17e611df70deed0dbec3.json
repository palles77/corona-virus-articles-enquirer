This situation has placed hospitals and health officials worldwide on heightened alert. In a future outbreak, rapidly and accurately distinguishing SARS from other common febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) could be difficult. We constructed a decision-analysis model to identify the most efficient strategies for managing undifferentiated FRIs within a hypothetical SARS outbreak in New York City during the season of respiratory infections. If establishing reliable epidemiologic links were not possible, societal costs would exceed $2.0 billion per month. SARS testing with existing polymerase chain reaction assays would have harmful public health and economic consequences if SARS made up <0.1% of circulating FRIs. Increasing influenza vaccination rates among the general population before the onset of respiratory season would save both money and lives.",

Since then, new cases of SARS have resurfaced in Asia, including several in the absence of laboratory exposures. This reemergence of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has sparked international concern and has prompted heightened surveillance by hospitals and health officials worldwide. Such concerns have been amplified by fears that a future SARS outbreak could coincide with respiratory infection season, when influenza infections and other febrile respiratory illnesses (FRIs) develop in large segments of the population.",

Should the timely establishment of epidemiologic links between SARS cases be lost in a future outbreak, frontline healthcare providers would be forced to rely on clinical signs and symptoms or diagnostic testing to confirm or exclude infections with SARS-CoV (2) . Unfortunately, the signs and symptoms of SARS are nonspecific and cannot be used reliably to differentiate SARS from other FRIs. Moreover, existing serologic tests for SARS-CoV cannot definitively exclude infection until at least 4 weeks has elapsed from the onset of symptoms and thus have no role in early clinical decision making (1) . Although reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays used to detect SARS-CoV can provide test results within a matter of hours, their suboptimal sensitivity makes them inadequate for ruling out SARS (3) . Furthermore, since SARS infections would likely make up a minute fraction of FRIs circulating among the general population, the pretest probability, and thus the positive predictive value of RT-PCR tests, would be extremely low, even if future generation assays had better test sensitivity and specificity.",

Should this seasonal pattern recur, rapidly and accurately differentiating SARS infections from other FRIs would become a critical component of any future outbreak containment efforts (2, 3) . This distinction will also continue to be an important issue among travelers in whom FRIs develop after their return from SARS-affected areas. However, existing diagnostic limitations place frontline healthcare practitioners in a precarious position, since clinical decisions with potentially dangerous consequences must be made in the face of uncertainty. Recognizing such limitations, WHO recently called for the development of evidence-based clinical algorithms to help address these diagnostic dilemmas (4) .",

In our analysis, the low positive predictive value of the SARS RT-PCR test translates into unnecessary costs from diagnostic testing, public health interventions, and lost opportunity costs for persons with false-positive test results. Moreover, negative consequences on quality of life would occur when persons are incorrectly diagnosed as having an infection with SARS. Our sensitivity analyses indicate that SARS diagnostic testing should not be performed unless the prevalence or pretest probability of SARS among persons presenting with FRIs exceeds 0.1%.",

In our analysis, we find that if SARS reemerged during respiratory season, higher rates of influenza vaccination among the general population would lead to both health benefits and economic savings. These savings would occur by reductions in influenza illness and death, reductions in costs related to the investigation and isolation of persons with FRIs, and increases in the pretest probability of SARS and, therefore, the positive predictive value of SARS diagnostic testing. The policy implications of these findings, however, must be carefully considered in the context of available influenza vaccine supplies and must ensure their prioritization for groups at high risk (40).",

Even if the world does not experience another large-scale, multinational outbreak, healthcare providers around the globe will continue to see patients with nonspecific FRIs who are incidentally returning from SARSaffected areas. This fact underscores the importance of having evidence-based guidelines to facilitate the timely and accurate distinction of SARS infections from other Distinguishing Febrile Respiratory Illnesses from SARS FRIs of lesser public health importance. Our analysis provides guidance on the most effective and efficient use of resources when managing persons with FRIs of undetermined etiology when the epidemiologic history for SARS is either unavailable or unreliable.
