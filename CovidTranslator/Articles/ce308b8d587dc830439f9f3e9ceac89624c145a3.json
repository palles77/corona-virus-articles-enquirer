            "text": "IFN signalling induces a broad and potent anti viral response against most viruses that infect vertebrate animals. Type I IFNs are a family of functionally and genetically related cytokines consisting of several members, with IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 being the most extensively studied 3 . Type I IFN signalling is mediated through a common receptor, the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR), which is a heterodimer of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 (REF. 4) . Signal transduction following the binding of a type I IFN to IFNAR occurs via Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and results in the translocation into the nucleus of the transcription factor complex IFNstimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3; which is comprised of IFN-regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2). Nuclear ISGF3 induces the transcription of hundreds of different IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs); indeed, it is estimated that 500 to 1,000 genes are induced per cell or tissue type [5] [6] [7] . These ISGs encode distinct proteins with diverse biological effects that block multiple stages of the viral replication cycle, including entry into host cells, protein translation, replication, assembly of new virus particles and spread. They can also have immunomodulatory functions, including effects on leukocyte recruitment and the priming of adaptive immunity. Beyond this, a subset of ISGs is induced in an IFN-independent manner after viral infection through the actions of transcription factors (such as IRF3) that respond directly to signals downstream of PRRs.",

            "text": "Abstract | Over the past few years, several groups have identified new genes that are transcriptionally induced downstream of type I interferon (IFN) signalling and that inhibit infection by individual or multiple families of viruses. Among these IFN-stimulated genes with antiviral activity are two genetically and functionally distinct families -the IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) family and the IFN-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) family. This Review focuses on recent advances in identifying the unique mechanisms of action of IFIT and IFITM proteins, which explain their broad-spectrum activity against the replication, spread and pathogenesis of a range of human viruses. 16 (IFI16) , DEAH box protein 9 (DHX9) and DHX36; and endosomal Toll-like receptors (TLRs), including TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9. Infection by RNA viruses produces RNA intermediates that are recognized as non-self by RIG-I and MDA5 in the cytosol and by TLR3 and TLR7 in endosomes. The RLRs interact with mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS), leading to the recruitment of TNFR-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5), or of IKK\u03b3 (also known as NEMO), IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2, which results in the activation and nuclear translocation of IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), respectively. TLRs interact with the adaptor proteins TRIF and MYD88, leading to the activation of IRF3 or IRF7. IRF3, IRF7 and NF-\u03baB bind to the interferon-\u03b2 (IFNB) gene promoter and induce transcription. Secretion of IFN\u03b2 by the infected cells results in paracrine type I IFN signalling through the IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor, which induces hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Phosphorylated IRF3 also can activate the expression of ISGs (such as IFIT and IFITM genes) independently of IFN signalling. DNA can be present in the cytoplasm and in endosomes during viral or bacterial infection and following the phagocytosis of dead cells. TLR9 recognizes CpG DNA in endosomes and activates MYD88. The binding of DNA by DAI or IFI16 results in stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-dependent activation of IRF3 and NF-\u03baB. RNA polymerase III transcribes this DNA to produce short RNAs containing a 5\u0374-ppp motif, which are ligands for RIG-I. DHX9 and DHX36 bind to DNA ligands (such as CpG-A and CpG-B DNA) in the cytosol and induce MYD88-and IRF7-dependent responses. ER, endoplasmic reticulum; I\u03baB, NF-\u03baB inhibitor. 13 ) and the ways in which these viruses can evade such control. In addition, systematic investigations of the antiviral functions of large groups of ISGs using ectopic gene screens 14, 15 have identified genes that coordinately control infection by several families of RNA and DNA viruses. There has been a resurgence of interest in defining ISGs with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, possibly as a means to identify new classes of drugs that activate these genes directly. Indeed, antiviral therapies that target host proteins rather than viral proteins could in theory minimize the emergence of resistance and the collateral effects associated with type I IFN therapy that limit its current clinical use. This Review describes recent advances in understanding the antiviral activity and mechanisms of action of two particular ISG families with broad-spectrum antiviral activity: the IFNinduced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) and IFN-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) families. Although these families are genetically and functionally distinct, a combined analysis of IFIT and IFITM proteins clarifies more generally how specific ISGs inhibit the replication, spread and pathogenesis of a range of human viruses.",

IFIT genes have a similar genomic structure, in that most of these genes are composed of two exons, with the second exon containing almost all of the coding sequence. IFIT gene homologues have been reported in several mammalian species, as well as in birds, fish and amphibians (reviewed in REF. 17 ). Four family members have been characterized in humans: IFIT1 (also known as ISG56), IFIT2 (also known as ISG54), IFIT3 (also known as ISG60) and IFIT5 (also known as ISG58). All four of these genes are located on chromosome 10q23. By contrast, three members are expressed in mice -Ifit1 (also known as Isg56), Ifit2 (also known as Isg54) and Ifit3 (also known as Isg49) -and they are located on chromosome 19qC1. Additional uncharacterized but highly related IFIT genes (namely IFIT1B in humans and Ifit1b, Ifit1c and Ifit3b in mice) exist in the same chromosomal regions as the known IFIT genes, although their functional significance and expression patterns remain undefined. Moreover, a non-transcribed IFIT1-related pseudogene is present on human chromosome 13 (REF. 18 ).",

Moreover, IFIT2 has a positively charged carboxy-terminal region that supports RNA binding, and the mutation or deletion of charged residues in this region altered viral RNA binding and negatively affected antiviral activity against Newcastle disease virus. This study also suggested that IFIT2 can bind to RNA containing AU-rich elements, which are sometimes found in mRNAs encoding cytokines or apoptotic factors, indicating a potential mechanism by which IFIT proteins might regulate inflammatory responses (see below).",

Examination of the cellular proteins associated with HCV translation complexes in IFN-treated human cells showed that human IFIT1 is an eIF3-associated factor that fractionates with the initiator ribosome-HCV RNA complex 41 . IFIT1 suppressed the function of the HCV IRES, whereas a mutant IFIT1 protein lacking eIF3-binding activity failed to inhibit HCV replication. Moreover, ectopic expression of IFIT1 decreased HCV infection in hepatocytes 42 . Thus, IFIT1 seems to block HCV replication by targeting eIF3-dependent steps in the viral RNA translation initiation process; these steps include the recognition of the 43S pre-initiation complex by the HCV IRES and the assembly of the 43S-mRNA complex (FIG. 3) .",

The figure shows a schematic diagram of translation initiation and the steps putatively blocked by IFIT family members. To begin translation in mammalian cells, free 40S ribosomal subunits are stabilized by eIF3 and bind to the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA) in the presence of eIF1 (not shown). This allows the assembly of the 43S pre-initiation complex, which then binds to mRNA that is capped at the 5\u0374 end and methylated at the N-7 and 2\u0374-O positions. This interaction is stabilized by eIF4E and eIF4G, and results in the formation of the 43S-mRNA complex, which is competent for AUG (start codon) scanning and mRNA translation. For hepatitis C virus (HCV) genomic RNA with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), association with eIF4E and eIF4G or other cap-binding factors is not required to stabilize the 43S-mRNA complex.",

In this study, VSV infection was uniformly lethal in Ifit2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, a phenotype that was associated with enhanced viral replication in neurons of the brain but not in cells from other organs, such as the lungs and liver. Finally, a third study showed that silencing of IFIT3 expression in human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in decreased IFN\u03b1-dependent antiviral activity against VSV. Moreover, ectopic expression of IFIT3 inhibited infection not only by VSV but also by encephalomyocarditis virus, a picornavirus that encodes the genome-linked protein Vpg, which binds to the 5\u0374 end of the viral RNA and probably blocks the uncapped 5\u0374-ppp 52 . Clearly, studies with additional RNA and DNA viruses and IFIT-deficient cells and mice are warranted to establish the mechanisms by which IFIT proteins control different families of viruses. Binding to viral proteins. IFIT1 can inhibit infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) -a large DNA virusthrough a distinct mechanism: by binding to the viral helicase E1, which is required for replication 53, 54 . E1 is a multifunctional viral protein with ATPase and DNA helicase activities. IFIT1 sequesters HPV E1 in the cytoplasm, partitioning it from the replication complex, which is localized to the nucleus. HPV replication is sensitive to the antiviral effects of type I IFNs, but silencing of IFIT1 expression using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) resulted in a loss of this inhibitory activity. In contrast to the wild-type E1 gene, transfection of a mutated E1 gene -encoding a mutant E1 protein that lacks residue 399 and cannot bind to IFIT1 -supported the replication of HPV DNA even in the presence of inhibitory levels of type I IFNs 54 .",

Two reports have suggested that IFIT proteins negatively regulate the host inflammatory and antiviral responses. One showed that ectopic expression of IFIT2 in mouse macrophages inhibited LPS-induced expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and CXCchemokine ligand 2 (CXCL2; also known as MIP2) and that this effect was mediated post-transcriptionally, possibly through effects on mRNA stability 55 . More recently, human IFIT1 and IFIT2 were reported to bind to and inhibit stimulator of IFN genes (STING; also known as MITA), which functions as a mitochondrial adaptor protein that recruits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IRF3 to a complex with mitochondrial antiviral signalling protein (MAVS; also known as IPS1, CARDIF and VISA), resulting in the downstream induction of IFN\u03b2 expression in response to viral RNA or DNA 56 . Ectopic expression of IFIT1 in human embryonic kidney 293T cells and macrophages inhibited the activation of IRF3 and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) and the transcription of IFNB in response to polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and prevented polyI:C-induced inhibition of VSV infection. Moreover, silencing of IFIT1 expression inhibited VSV infection, presumably by modulating the IRF3-and IFN-dependent responses. A biochemical analysis indicated that IFIT1 disrupted the physical interaction between STING and MAVS or TBK1. Although provocative, these data conflict with the results of experiments in human HeLa cells in which silencing of IFIT1 and IFIT2 expression resulted in increased levels of VSV infection 50 . This study also showed that the modulation of IFIT protein levels did not alter type I IFN responses in mouse fibroblasts, macrophages or dendritic cells 50 . Moreover, other groups reported recently that silencing of mouse Ifit1 suppresses the expression of inflammatory genes in response to LPSmediated TLR4 activation 57 and that ectopic expression of IFIT3 enhances IRF3-mediated gene expression 58 . In the latter study, a TPR motif of IFIT3 interacted with the amino terminus of TBK1, and bridged TBK1 to MAVS on mitochondria, such that the host antiviral responses were boosted in the presence of IFIT3. Given these ostensibly conflicting results, more investigation is required to evaluate the network of immunomodulatory effects of individual IFIT proteins in cell culture and in vivo.",

Because of their ability to bind components of the eIF3 complex and inhibit host protein trans lation, IFIT proteins might contribute to the restriction of cell division imposed by IFN signalling. Independently, IFIT proteins may modulate the expression of negative regulators of the cell cycle, leading to the accumulation of cells at the G1-S phase transition 60 . Indeed, ectopic expression of IFIT3 in U937 human myeloid cells resulted in the sequestration of JUN activation domainbinding protein 1 (JAB1; also known as COPS5), which limited ubiquitin-and proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (also known as p27 and KIP1). In other studies, IFIT1 was shown to bind and sequester the ribosomal protein L15 (RPL15). Ectopic expression of IFIT1 or silencing of RPL15 had an anti-proliferative effect on human gastric cancer cells, and higher IFIT1 levels correlated with enhanced sensitivity to IFN-induced inhibition of proliferation 61 . Finally, expression of human IFIT2, independently of IFN-mediated stimulation, was shown recently to promote cell apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway. In this study, IFIT2 formed a complex with IFIT1 and IFIT3, and IFIT3 was shown to negatively regulate the pro-apoptotic effects of IFIT2 (REF. 62 ). Thus, IFIT proteins as a complex seem to regulate cell apoptosis after the induction of type I IFN responses or other cell stress pathways.",

Moreover, recent functional studies suggest that IFIT family members might also regulate cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic immune responses, through pathways that remain to be defined and/or corroborated. As new structural and functional insights are gained about individual IFIT family members, it is likely that we will begin to appreciate the basis and complexity of the ligand interactions that explain the distinct functions of IFIT proteins in controlling viral pathogenesis and, possibly, in minimizing immune-mediated damage to the host.",

The expression of human IFITM3 and mouse Ifitm3 is also induced by IFN\u03b3 and by members of the gp130 family of cytokines (such as oncostatin M and IL-6), which all use similar JAK-STAT signalling mechanisms.

            "text": "There are several implications of this early restriction step. First, IFITM-mediated restriction precedes the induction of type I IFNs in infected cells, which might explain the high basal level of expression of IFITM proteins in many tissues. IFN induction, however, can amplify IFITM expression and protect uninfected cells in a paracrine manner, and acute-phase cytokines such as IL-6 might induce IFITM expression systemically. Second, viral escape from restriction by IFITM proteins could be more challenging than escape from inhibitory factors that function at later stages of the viral replication cycle. For example, viral proteins such as HIV-1 Vif and Vpu, which are generated after viral entry, allow the virus to evade host responses mediated by APOBEC3G or BST2 (which affect viral replication and assembly) by degrading these restriction factors. In comparison, because IFITM-mediated restriction precedes infection, there is no opportunity for the de novo synthesis of viral inhibitors. Thus, the virion must carry a protein that counteracts IFITM-mediated restriction (which is unlikely given the relatively small amount of viral protein that is delivered to a cell) or alter its site of fusion with host cell membranes (FIG. 6) .",

By contrast, infection by alphaviruses, arenaviruses and murine leukaemia virus (a retrovirus) seems to be unaffected by IFITM protein expression. VSV is weakly restricted by IFITM proteins, and HIV-1 might be restricted in a cell-type specific manner 14, 77 . These varying degrees of restriction are also observed for retroviruses pseudotyped with the entry proteins of different viruses. Viruses that are restricted by IFITM proteins tend to fuse with host cell membranes in a late endosome or lysosome.

Ectopic expression of IFITM proteins does not alter the expression of virus receptors, affect the pH of endosomal compartments or interfere with the cathepsin activity that is necessary for the fusion of some restricted viruses. Although IFITM proteins can be detected on the plasma membrane, particularly when overexpressed or induced by IFNs, they are enriched in intracellular compartments, including late endosomes, where restricted viruses fuse. Two models have been proposed to explain the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins 73, 74 (FIG. 6) . In the first model, IFITM proteins are hypothesized to modify endosomal or lysosomal vesicles such that they become inhospitable to viral fusion. IFITM proteins could achieve this by altering the lipid components of the vesicle membrane, by enriching vesicles with nonspecific proteases that inactivate entry proteins or, as proposed recently 80 , by interfering with the activity of the V-type proton ATPase, which is responsible for endosomal acidification. In the second model, IFITM proteins could alter the rate or pattern of vesicle trafficking such that viruses are redirected to a non-fusogenic pathway. The expression of IFITM proteins in many cell lines induces large vacuoles, suggesting that these proteins in some way interfere with vesicle trafficking, fusion or resolution 73 . However, the presence and size of these vacuoles do not correlate with the efficiency of restriction, and morphological changes were not observed when endogenous IFITM proteins were depleted, despite the increased levels of influenza A virus replication in these cells 72, 74 . As in the case of the IFIT proteins, the absence of obvious enzymatic domains in the IFITM proteins suggests that cellular cofactors are necessary for antiviral activity. Consistent with this possibility, IFITM proteins have species-specific signature sequences that are localized at the cytoplasmic base of both transmembrane domains (FIG. 5b) .",

Although other functions have been proposed, the primary role of IFITM proteins seems to be antiviral. IFITM3 in particular significantly contributes to the control of influenza A virus in vivo, and tissue-culture studies suggest that several of the other IFITM proteins help to restrict infection by other enveloped viruses. The expression of IFITM proteins makes cells refractory to steps in the viral infection cycle that precede viral fusion, but the mechanisms by which these proteins mediate such functions remain incompletely defined. It also remains poorly understood how IFITM proteins differentially restrict distinct viruses, and whether they can modulate the replication of other pathogens, including non-enveloped viruses, bacteria and parasites. As in the case of the IFIT proteins, additional work to characterize the activity and regulation of IFITM proteins may suggest more tailored approaches for controlling infection by specific pathogens. 82 ). These viruses are not susceptible to IFITM-mediated restriction. By contrast, viruses such as influenza A virus fuse in late endosomes and are restricted by IFITM proteins, particularly by IFITM3 (REF. 72 ). Viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Ebola virus and influenza A virus depend on lysosomal cathepsins and other lysosome-resident proteins for fusion, and these viruses are restricted mainly by IFITM1 (REF. 74 ). Mouse IFITM6 is more specialized and restricts the entry of Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus, but not influenza A virus. Trypsin treatment of SARS coronavirus allows it to fuse at the plasma membrane and bypass IFITM-mediated restriction. Retroviruses pseudotyped with entry proteins from these viruses show identical patterns of restriction, implicating the entry process in the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins. Note that the diagram is schematic and ignores much of the diversity of cellular compartments and the complexity of cellular trafficking.",

IFIT proteins function in the cytoplasm, whereas IFITM proteins traverse the membrane and are enriched in late endosomes and lysosomes. IFIT proteins suppress the initiation of translation, bind to and sequester uncapped viral RNA, and sequester at least one viral protein (HPV E1) in the cytoplasm. IFITM proteins, by contrast, prevent several enveloped viruses from fusing with endosomal or lysosomal membranes and penetrating the cytoplasm. Moreover, IFIT proteins are expressed poorly, if at all, in the absence of inflammatory or danger signals, whereas IFITM proteins are expressed basally in many tissues. IFITM proteins generally are induced to greater levels than IFIT proteins by IFN\u03b3, and possibly by members of the gp130 family of cytokines (such as IL-6). However, although there are many differences, there are some parallels between IFIT and IFITM proteins. Compared with the APOBEC family of restriction factors, the IFIT and IFITM families target a wider range of viruses. Moreover, and similarly to the APOBEC proteins, the IFIT and IFITM families comprise specialized paralogues, perhaps reflecting an evolutionary arms race with pathogens. A deeper understanding of the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of the members of each family may facilitate the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents that mimic or amplify their activities.",

Viral infection by negative-stranded RNA viruses (such as Rift Valley fever virus, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus) generates single-or double-stranded RNA with uncapped 5\u0374-ppp motifs. These RNA molecules are recognized by the cytoplasmic sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). RIG-I and MDA5 induce the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) -including IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), IFIT2 and IFIT3 -through both interferon-\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2)-dependent pathways and IFN\u03b2-independent (for example, IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3)-dependent) pathways. IFIT1 functions as a sensor of viral RNA containing the 5\u0374-ppp motif, resulting in the assembly of an IFIT1-IFIT2-IFIT3 complex. This presumably inhibits viral infection by sequestering RNA from the actively replicating pool or by promoting RNA degradation.

It remains unclear whether IFIT proteins inhibit viruses that lack 2\u0374-O methylation at the stage of protein translation by directly recognizing non-2\u0374-O-methylated viral RNA, thereby preventing the recognition of viral RNA by the 43S pre-initiation complex, or by serving as a scaffold for other proteins that regulate translation(FIG. 3). Wild-type alphaviruses of the Togaviridae family, which are positive-stranded cytoplasmic RNA viruses, lack 2\u0374-O methylation on their viral RNA48 and, thus, should be sensitive to IFIT-mediated restriction. Although further mechanistic studies are warranted, in support of this hypothesis ectopic expression of IFIT1 inhibited infection by Sindbis virus, and, reciprocally, silencing of Ifit1 expression resulted in enhanced infection49 .5\u0374-ppp RNA recognition.A recent study indicates that human IFIT1 can also function as a sensor for viral RNA by recognizing an uncapped 5\u0374-ppp and sequestering the RNA from the actively replicating pool 50(FIG. 4). Using a proteomics approach with 5\u0374-ppp RNA as bait, a mass spectrometry analysis identified IFIT1 as a primary binding partner. Subsequent experiments showed that only IFIT1 interacts directly with 5\u0374-ppp on RNA, whereas IFIT2 and IFIT3 form a complex with IFIT1 that is required for antiviral function. These IFIT-dependent interactions were relevant in protecting against RNA viruses displaying a 5\u0374-ppp, as silencing of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 expression in HeLa cells enhanced the replication of the negative-stranded RNA viruses Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza A virus to varying degrees, despite the fact that the production of mRNA encoding IFN\u03b2 was unaffected. By contrast, ectopic expression of individual IFIT proteins in cells did not confer an inhibitory effect on these viruses, suggesting that the IFIT protein complex is required for this antiviral activity. Studies with Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mouse fibroblasts and myeloid cells also showed enhanced replication of VSV despite wild-type production levels of type I IFNs and other pro-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were more vulnerable to infection with VSV, with higher virus-induced mortality observed. However, and in apparent conflict, experiments by a second group using the same VSV strain but an independently",
