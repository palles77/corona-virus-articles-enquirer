            "text": "We report a case of fatal pneumonia and viremia due to human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV-1) in a 65-year-old male patient with adult T-cell leukemiaelymphoma (ATL) treated with mogamulizumab, a brand-new therapeutic agent for ATL. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing viremia due to HPIV-1. After administering mogamulizumab, lymphocyte count in the blood was drastically decreased and the patient suffered from complicated infections including gram-negative bacterial sepsis, cytomegalovirus antigenemia and aspergillosis. Although these infections were successfully controlled by broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy, patchy ground-grass opacities in the both lungs were gradually worsened. He finally died due to acute respiratory failure. Since findings of the chest CT was consistent with typical patterns of viral pneumonia, we screened major respiratory viruses in the peripheral blood with multiplex PCR, and it turned out that RNA of HPIV-1 was positive. Although ATL cells were not detected in the autopsied lungs and a variety of other tissues, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies, which are commonly observed in RNA viral infection, were abundantly observed in the autopsied lung tissue. These findings suggest that mogamulizumab accomplished complete remission of ATL, while the chemotherapy-induced prolonged lymphopenia caused fatal pneumonia and viremia due to HPIV-1. As it has been well recognized that community respiratory viruses including HPIV-1 often cause fatal pneumonia in patients with leukemia, but also there is no specific treatment for HPIV-1, we have to enforce standard precautions especially when we treat leukemic patients with intensively immunosuppressive agents such as mogamulizumab.",

It is classified into four categories (acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types) depending on clinical features [2] . ATL is often resistant to chemotherapies, thus resulting in poor prognosis [3] . Since ATL per se induces severe impairment of cellular immunity, ATL patients are susceptible to opportunistic infections by cytomegalovirus (CMV), candida, Pneumocystis jirovecci, and Strongyloides stercoralis [4] . Mogamulizumab is a promising, brand-new therapeutic option for ATL. This agent binds CeC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) protein abundantly expressed in membrane surface of ATL cells, thereby activating natural killer cells in a manner of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [5] . In patients treated with mogamulizumab, median progression-free survival and overall survival intervals were 5.2 and 13.7 months, respectively [5] . On the other hand, its profile of robust cytotoxicity would be problematic in some cases. In fact, it has been suggested that mogamulizumab increases the risk of reactivation of CMV and hepatitis B virus [6, 7] .",

Therefore, combined regimens with VCAP (vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone), AMP (doxorubicin, ranimustine, and prednisone), and VECP (vindesine, etoposide, carboplatin, and prednisone) were started as an induction chemotherapy.

On day 2 after induction of mogamulizumab, ATL cells disappeared in the peripheral blood, and the number of lymphocytes was rapidly decreased to 460/mL, accompanied by the prolongation of severe lymphopenia (grade 3e4) (Fig. 1 ). Despite prophylactic medication had been administered with levofloxacin (LVFX), itraconazole (ITCZ), sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (ST) and acyclovir (ACV), he suffered from infectious complications including CMV antigenemia, gram-negative bacterial sepsis, and aspergillosis during the clinical course. Although these infections were well controlled by the broad spectrum antimicrobial treatment, multiple patchy ground-glass opacities in bilateral lungs, an atypical pattern of bacterial pneumonia, were appeared and gradually worsened. Due to acute respiratory failure, he died on day 48 (Figs. 1 and 2). Since chest CT showed typical patterns of viral pneumonia (Fig. 2) , the peripheral blood was collected premortally and examined with multiplex PCR kit (Seeplex RV15 OneStep ACE Detection, Seegene, South Korea), which can screen most CRVs including influenza virus A/B, human adenovirus, coronavirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, rhinovirus A/B/C, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus A/B, bocavirus 1/2/3/4, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus [11] .

On the other hand, neutrophilic infiltration and microorganisms including bacteria and fungi were not observed. Also, CCR4 antigen-positive ATL cells were not detected at all in the lung and a variety of tissues, indicating that his ATL status was complete remission. Taken together, we finally diagnosed that the cause of death was severe pneumonia due to HPIV-1 infection. ",

LRTI due to HPIV occurred in 13%e43% in patients with leukemia and HSCT recipients, and its mortality rate was 12e50% [15] . The most important risk factor for progression to LRTI is lymphopenia. Although the thresholds vary according to studies, lymphocyte count less than 200/mL is accepted as the guideline [8, 13] . In the present case, prolongation of severe lymphopenia less than 200/mL was considered as the possible main cause to develop fatal pneumonia and viremia due to HPIV-1.",

Although the typical tree-inbud opacities were not observed in the present case, centrilobular nodules suggesting bronchiolitis were observed on day 32, and the findings were worsened to diffuse patchy ground-glass opacities over the clinical course (Fig. 2) .
