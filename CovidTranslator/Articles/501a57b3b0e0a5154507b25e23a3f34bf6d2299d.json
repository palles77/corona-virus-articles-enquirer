A mechanism has been proposed by which the peptide, being positioned on the surface of the cell membrane, inhibits its fusion with the virus. In the present work, peptide-lipid interactions of C8 with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes are investigated using electron spin resonance spectroscopy of spin-labelled lipids. Three other peptides, obtained from modiWcations of C8, have also been investigated, in an attempt to clarify the essential molecular features of the interactions involving the tryptophan residues. The results show that C8 adsorbs strongly on the bilayer surface. Membrane binding requires not only the presence of the Trp residues in the sequence, but also their common orientation on one side of the peptide that is engendered by the WX 2 WX 2 W motif. Membrane interaction correlates closely with peptide antiviral activity, indicating that the membrane is essential in stabilizing the peptide conformation that will be able to inhibit viral infection.",

These glycoproteins, named gp41 and gp36, respectively, exhibit a common structural architecture consisting of a transmembrane (TM) region and membrane-proximal segment (pre-TM) that is directly involved in the virus-target cell fusion. Furthermore, both proteins present an unusual clustering of tryptophan residues in the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the ectodomain of the TM region (Giannecchini et al. 2004; Suarez et al. 2000; Salzwedel et al. 1999) .

The antiviral activity is likely to derive from adsorption of the peptide on the external surface of the target-cell membrane, where it competes with the TM glycoprotein of the virus (Schibli et al. 2001) . In this context, we have recently investigated the interactions between an antiviral peptide derived from the MPER domain of the FIV surface glycoprotein and phospholipid membranes. A 20-mer peptide named P59, corresponding to the 767 L-G 786 sequence of (TM) gp36, was synthesized and found to exert potent inhibitory activity on FIV replication ). Subsequently, we investigated interactions of P59 with phospholipid bilayers by electron spin resonance (ESR) experiments, using spinlabelled lipids (D'Errico et al. 2008) . The results demonstrate that the P59 peptide associates with lipid bilayers by binding at the membrane surface or polar-apolar interface. This is consistent with high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis of P59 in micellar environments, which revealed a region of secondary structural order in the sequence extending from Trp 770 to Ile 777 (Giannecchini et al. 2007) . In particular, an amphipathic, turn-helical structure forms, in which the polar or charged residues are positioned on one side, with the opposite side occupied by hydrophobic residues including the three tryptophans, which have a propensity to localize to the polar-apolar interface of membranes de Planque et al. 1998 ). This sequence seems to be fundamental in determining the peptide antiviral activity. Indeed, an octapeptide with the 770 Trp-Ile 777 sequence (named C8 or peptide 1; Table 1 ) was found to exert an antiviral activity comparable to that of the P59 20-mer (Giannecchini et al. 2003) .",

Peptide 1, also named C8, corresponds to the 770 Trp-Ile 777 sequence of FIV gp36 with three Trp residues separated by two dipeptide units. The other three peptides have been strategically chosen among a series of C8 mutants whose antiviral activity was tested as reported in a previous study . The changes in their molecular structure allow the analysis of the peptide molecular features driving the peptide/membrane interaction. Particularly, we have focused our attention on the spacing between the Trp residues and on their replacements with other non-natural aromatic residue. In peptide 2, the two dipeptides have been replaced by a shorter spacer: 3-aminopropionic acid (or -alanine; Ala), which reduces the distance along the peptide backbone by two atoms for each dipeptide replaced by Ala. In order to compensate for the increased hydrophobicity of peptide 2, an additional Lys residue has been added at the N-terminus. Lys is the amino acid occurring naturally at the corresponding position of the gp36 sequence. In peptide 3, the Trp residues have been replaced by a non-natural aromatic residue: 3-biphenyl-4yl-L-alanine (Bip, see Scheme 1 for the molecular structure).

For ESR experiments, appropriate amounts of DMPC in dichloromethane/methanol (2/1 v/v) and spin-labelled phosphatidylcholines in ethanol were mixed in small test tubes. A thin Wlm of the lipid was produced by evaporating the solvent with dry nitrogen gas. Final traces of solvent were removed by subjecting the sample to vacuum desiccation for at least 3 h. The samples were then hydrated with 20-50 l of 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 buVer (HBS) and vortexed. The lipid suspension thus obtained was transferred to a 100-l glass capillary and pelleted in a tabletop centrifuge. The supernatant was removed and the capillary was Xame sealed. Samples containing peptide were prepared in a similar manner, except that the lipid Wlm was hydrated directly with the peptide solution in HBS (at a concentration of 10 mg/ml). In some cases, as discussed below, it was found that the samples containing peptide 1 (C8) became optically clear and could no longer be pelleted; therefore, the sample was used as such for ESR study. In view of this limitation, the volume of the peptide solution added was minimized using a higher concentration of the peptide (20 mg/ml, obtained by gentle warming and sonication), such that the amount of sample in the ESR cavity was maximized.",

The samples investigated were spin-labelled phosphatidylcholine (5-PCSL) in DMPC membranes, in the presence and absence of peptides. As an example, ESR spectra from DMPC membranes in the presence and absence of peptide 1 (C8), recorded at temperatures above and below the chain-melting transition of DMPC (24\u00b0C), are shown in Fig. 1 . SigniWcant perturbations due to the peptide are detectable (compare solid and dashed lines). A quantitative analysis of this eVect can be done by plotting the temperature dependences of the outer hyperWne splittings (2A max ) of 5-PCSL, as shown in Fig. 2 . In the absence of any peptide, a sharp decrease in 2A max is evident at the chain-melting temperature, corresponding to the increase in the spin-label rotational mobility on transition from the gel to the Xuid phase (Ramakrishnan et al. 2003) . Addition of 0.7:1 wt/wt peptide to DMPC membranes causes changes in 2A max , the extent of which depends on the particular peptide. This peptide/lipid ratio has been chosen because, in the case of interacting peptides, it ensures the bilayer to be completely perturbed, see the following subsection. Peptide 1 (C8) causes the largest eVects of the peptides studied. The chain-melting transition is broadened almost beyond detection by the interaction with C8: 2A max decreases in the gel phase and increases strongly in the Xuid phase. Peptide 2 shows negligible interaction, hardly changing the transition and values of 2A max . Peptide 3 also produces only small perturbation of 2A max , i.e. little interaction with lipid membranes. In the presence of peptide 4, the co-operativity of the DMPC chain-melting transition is strongly reduced, even if its position remains approximately the same. Above the transition temperature, peptide 4 causes a very signiWcant increase in 2A max , although less than that observed for peptide 1.",

In the absence of peptide, the outer hyperWne splitting decreases progressively with increasing n, as the spin-label position is stepped down the chain towards the centre of the membrane.

For both peptides, the characteristic Xexibility gradient with chain position of the Xuid lipid bilayer membranes is preserved. In the presence of bound peptides 1 or 4, the outer hyperWne splitting is increased at all spin-label chain positions. This indicates that the increase in lipid packing density, which is induced by surface association of the peptide (Ramakrishnan et al. 2003; Swamy and Marsh 2001) , propagates throughout the chain region. For either peptide, there is no appearance of a second, more motionally restricted component in the spectra of the spin labels positioned towards the terminal methyl ends of the chains. This is evidence that the peptides bind solely at the membrane surface and do not penetrate appreciably into the membrane interior, as does, for instance, the myelin basic protein or apocytochrome c (Sankaram and Marsh 1993) .

Indeed, in previous work, we found that the electrostatic contribution to the interaction between the 20-mer peptide P59, whose sequence includes C8, and phospholipid bilayers is negligible (D'Errico et al. 2008) . In order to allow a straightforward interpretation of the data and a direct comparison with the results already reported for P59, we also chose not to include other lipids in the bilayer composition.

The presence of these tryptophan residues and their spatial arrangement has been found to be essential for the antiviral activity . In particular, the substitution of the indole ring of tryptophan, and/or a change of the ring orientation, led to a dramatic decrease of the peptide activity. Since tryptophan residues are usually strongly involved in the interaction with biological membranes, it is possible that the variation in the peptide antiviral activity is due to their diVerent ability to interact with the membranes. In order to investigate this aspect, we also studied the behaviour of three analogues, each of them diVering from C8 for a single molecular feature. Peptide 2 has a shorter spacing between the Trp residues. In peptides 3 and 4 the Trp residues have been replaced by a non-natural aromatic amino acid, Bip or Nal2, with diVerent side chain topology (Scheme 1).

The presence of two conjugated aromatic rings seems important because, whereas an attenuated interaction is preserved if the indole group is replaced by a naphthyl one, the interaction is lost completely if a biphenyl group is substituted. However, simply the presence of three Trp residues (as in peptide 2) is insuYcient; they must be spaced such that they are located on the same side of the putative helix. Conformational studies by CD and NMR show that all four peptides, which adopt a prevalent random coil conformation in water, assume a turn-folded conformation in DMSO/water mixtures (Giannecchini et al. 2003; D'Ursi et al. 2006 ). In the case of C8 an amphiphilic helix forms, in which the polar or charged residues are positioned on one side, the opposite being occupied by hydrophobic residues and by the three Trp residues, which are known to have a propensity to locate to the polar-apolar interface. A comparative conformational analysis shows that while the structures of peptides 1 and 4 are almost superimposable, i.e. the Trp and Nal2 side chains are iso-sterically oriented, this is not true for peptide 2, because the shorter spacer induces a backbone arrangement that minimizes interactions between the Trp rings, resulting in oppositely oriented side chains.",

Each C helix is preferentially in contact with one of three symmetry-related hydrophobic cavities on the surface of the coiled coil. In principle, compounds that are able to insert stably in these cavities should actively block the protein function, thus inhibiting viral infection. However, small peptides designed to bind in such a cavity exhibit no antiviral activity, and this has been attributed to conformational instability (Chan et al. 1998; Eckert et al. 1999) .

This is an energy-costing event that involves destabilization of the bilayer and dehydration of the interfacial regions. Our results show that C8 (and also P59) destabilizes phospholipid bilayer membranes, producing smaller micelle-like aggregates at peptide to lipid weight ratios > 0.8. This eVect is due to the synergistic action of the three tryptophan residues. In fact, a similar behaviour has been recently reported for Trp-Trp and Trp-Trp-Trp oligomers (Stano et al. 2005) . This suggests the existence of a speciWc interaction between membranes formed by phosphatidylcholine lipids and Trp-rich peptides. However, the mechanism and microstructural details of this interaction are not satisfactorily understood. Our spin-label results exclude a deep insertion of the peptide in the bilayer, rather indicating adsorption of the peptide at the membrane interface. This is further supported by Xuorescence measurements, showing that, even in the presence of excess DMPC, the tryptophan residues of C8 are not embedded in the hydrophobic bilayer inner core, continuing to be located in a polar environment, such as that deWned by the fully hydrated lipid headgroups. These results are in agreement with those in the literature. In fact, Yau et al. (1998) showed that the Trp residues of peptides interacting with biomembranes tend to be positioned at the interface. This is related to the aromatic nature of indole (comprehensive of dipole and quadrupole, H-bonding, cation-and steric interactions), which confer an amphipathic behaviour on the Trp residue, so that contact with water is disfavoured and, at the same time, deep penetration into the bilayer hydrophobic core is also precluded. Molecular dynamic calculations have also shown that indoles are preferably positioned in the region deWned by the headgroups and upper acyl chain sections of phosphatidylcholine lipids (GrossWeld and Woolf 2002), and linear dichroism measurements have indicated that the indole plane is at an oblique angle with respect to the membrane normal (Esbj\u00f6rner et al. 2007) .",

This disrupts the hydration structure of phosphocholine groups (GrossWeld and Woolf 2002) and, also because of steric reasons, increases the distance between them. Consequently, the result of the peptide solubilization is an altered lipid packing, so that the bilayer evolves towards smaller aggregates with higher surface curvature. This perturbation is more eVective because of the Trp residues closeness. It is likely that, similar to what is observed by small-angle neutron scattering measurements with P59 (D'Errico et al. 2008) , phospholipid liposomes are converted by binding of C8 into smaller rod-like micelles. This destabilizing eVect is not observed for the other peptides used here, because of their diminished or non-existent capacity to interact with the bilayer.
