Thus, the point mutation rates among RNA viruses is approximately 10 \u00ff4 to 10 \u00ff5 , whereas in DNA viruses it is 10 \u00ff8 to 10 \u00ff11 [1] . In the case of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), the in vivo point mutation rate is 4 \u00c2 10 \u00ff5 mutations per bp per replication cycle (i.e. 2 mutations in 5 new genomes produced) [2] . The mutation rate of the SARS-CoV during the 2002e2003 epidemic was estimated to be 8.26 \u00c2 10 \u00ff6 per nt per day (i.e. 3 mutations per RNA in every round of replication) [3] .",

In the case of influenza A virus, the accumulation of a series of point mutations on the influenza virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) results in amino acid residue substitutions on antigenic sites of HA [5] .

As illustrated in Fig. 1B , when two different strains of influenza A viruses co-infect the same cell, progeny viruses may inherit sets of RNA segments made up of combinations of segments from either of the parent viruses.

HIV is now not considered a zoonosis, since every case of human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is acquired from another human being. However, HIV was zoonotic in origin. It was a cross-species transmission from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), which is found in nonhuman primates, to human beings several decades earlier [20, 24] . In fact, HIV and SIV are transmitted the same way (i.e. blood-borne) and found in blood. The two viruses are very similar in genomic organization. Data from phylogenetic trees and geographic habitats show that HIV-1 is most closely related to SIVcpz, an SIV found in a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) [25] . Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is most closely identified with SIVsm, an SIV found in the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys) [26] . Although HIV causes AIDS in humans, SIV does not cause any disease in its natural hosts. SIVs might enter man via monkey blood and could be transmitted from nonhuman primates to humans either by eating raw monkey meat, drinking monkey blood, or perhaps through another method of direct exposure to monkey bodily fluids (Fig. 4) .",

In the Chinese culture, fresh foods from wild animals are considered great delicacies, (called ''wild taste''). The captured wild animals are bred in markets or restaurants for human consumption and kept in squalid animal-holding cages made of metal or wood. It has been thought that a zoonotic virus can be transmitted from animals to food handlers who handle, kill, or butcher animals.

Lacking their food supply, the fruitbats (also known as flying-foxes; Pteropus species), the natural reservoir of NiV, migrated from the forest to cultivated fruit orchards. In pigsties located around the fruit orchards, pigs ingested bat saliva from half-eaten dropped fruit containing the NiV. The virus spread easily in the overcrowded farms and allowed the transmission of NiV from the fruitbat to the domestic pigs and ultimately to humans [37, 38] (Fig. 7A) . Similar conditions occurred with the HeV outbreak in 1994e5 in Queensland, Australia [39] . During that time, horses were infected with HeV from bat placental fluid.

The warm climate triggers the increase in plant and insect populations in mountain areas. In the past 15 years, mosquitoborne infections (including dengue fever and yellow fever) are being reported at high elevations in South and Central America, Asia, and East and Central Africa since the expansion of mosquito populations [53, 54] .",

The subsequent dry spring and summer in 1999 decreased the number of predators for mosquitoes such as frogs, lacewings, and ladybugs. In the meantime, water for larvae breeding sites evaporated, and nourishing organic compounds became concentrated. The mosquito population grew very large. As more and more mosquitoes became infected, they easily spread the WNV to birds and ultimately to humans.",

EID outbreaks highlight the shortcomings in our understanding of the complexities of infectious diseases. The reasons for emergence and re-emergence are multiple and complex ( Table 3 ). Factors that contribute to the emergence of EIDs are (1) virus evolution and adaptation, (2) human factors, and (3) ecological changes. Clearly, human activities are a key factor for driving disease emergence, and the current knowledge of the various emerging viruses is far from complete. It could be said that the current global situation favors disease emergence, and we may be faced with more outbreaks or pandemics of EIDs in the future.",

However, humans and other mammals serve as ''dead-end hosts'', which do not sufficiently amplify virus for mosquito transmission. Arrows represent the route of transmission.

(B) To save storage space, the animal-holding cages are often stacked cage upon cage. Animals at the same level can transfer disease by fighting (arrow 1) or biting (arrow 2). The excreted droppings from the upper level wound increase the chance of infection in the animals held in the lower level (arrow 3).
