This investigation proposed a combined fast fluid dynamics (FFD) and Markov chain model for fast predicting transient particle transport indoors. The solver for FFD-Markov-chain model was programmed in OpenFOAM, an open-source CFD toolbox. This study used two cases from the literature to validate the developed model and found well agreement between the transient particle concentrations predicted by the FFD-Markov-chain model and the experimental data. This investigation further compared the FFD-Markov-chain model with the CFD-Eulerian model and CFD-Lagrangian model in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The accuracy of the FFD-Markov-chain model was similar to that of the other two models. For the two studied cases, the FFD-Markovchain model was 4.7 and 6.8 times faster, respectively, than the CFD-Eulerian model, and it was 137.4 and 53.3 times faster than the CFD-Lagrangian model in predicting the steady-state airflow and transient particle transport. Therefore, the FFD-Markov-chain model is able to greatly reduce the computing cost for predicting transient particle transport in indoor environments.",

            "text": "Exposure to outdoor particles has been linked to various adverse health effects, such as asthma (Pope et al. 2002) and shortened life expectancy (Pope et al. 2009 ). Although people stay indoors for most of their time (Klepeis et al. 2001) , particles that originate outdoors can enter indoor environments through natural ventilation, mechanical ventilation, and infiltration (Chen and Zhao 2011; Chen et al. 2011ab, 2012a Lee et al. 2017; Shi et al. 2017 ). In addition to particles from the outdoor environment, there are many indoor particle sources, such as cigarette smoking (Patino and Siegel 2018) , cooking (Singer et al. 2017; Zhao and Zhao 2018) , human activity (You et al. 2013; Lai et al. 2017) , and chemical reactions (Chen et al. 2012c; Yao and Zhao 2017) . Furthermore, particles exhaled by an infected person can result in the transmission of many airborne infectious diseases indoors, including influenza (Moser et al. 1979) , tuberculosis (Menzies et al. 2000) , measles (Bloch et al. 1985) , and SARS (Yu et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2011c) . In most cases, the particle concentration distribution indoors is non-uniform, and the transport process is transient in nature. Therefore, it is crucial to correctly simulate the transient particle transport in indoor environments that further facilitate the design of indoor airflow, and finally reduce health risks.",

All these studies came to the same conclusion, that the RNG k-\u03b5 model is the most robust turbulence model for indoor airflow simulations. For modelling the particle transport, researchers and engineers traditionally used the Eulerian model and Lagrangian model Zhao et al. 2008; Wang et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2013 ). The Eulerian model solves the scalar governing equation to obtain the particle concentration distribution (e.g. Zhao et al. 2009; Seepana and Lai 2012; Li et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2014ab, 2018 , while the Lagrangian model predicts the particle trajectories to reflect the particle movements (e.g. Chao and Wan 2006; Chen et al. , 2015a Zhang and Li 2012) . However, both methods are computational demanding for particle transport calculations. For example, Wang et al. (2012) found that calculating the transient particle concentration distributions in a simple room took more than 60 hours when using the two models. Therefore, it is crucial to develop faster simulation models to facilitate the prediction of transient particle transport indoors. Since both airflow and particle modeling are time consuming, it is worthwhile to accelerate the computing for both aspects. For airflow modeling, the use of fast fluid dynamics (FFD) has been proven to reduce the computing cost in comparison with CFD (Zuo and Chen 2009; Jin et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2016 Liu et al. , 2017 Liu and Chen 2018) . FFD solves the Navier-Stokes equations with a time-advancement and pressure projection method. For example, Liu et al. (2017) reported that FFD saved the computing cost of airflow prediction by 20 times when compared with CFD, with comparable accuracy. For particle modeling, the recently developed Markov chain model does not require iterations in each time step when solving the particle transport equations and was proved to be much more efficient than the Eulerian and Lagrangian models (Chen et al. 2014c; Chen et al. 2015bc; Fontanini et al. 2015 Fontanini et al. , 2017 Mei et al. 2017; Mei and Gong 2018) . For instance, Chen et al. (2015b) applied the Markov chain model to calculate inter-person particle transport indoors and the method was more than 6 times faster than the traditional models. Although FFD and the Markov chain model can accelerate the airflow and transient particle transport calculations, respectively, the combined effects on accuracy and computing cost are unknown. Therefore, this study developed a combined FFD and Markov chain model and evaluated the model in terms of accuracy and computing cost.",

However, the integration of LES into FFD has not yet been achieved, and its performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency is unknown. In regard to the Markov chain model, the current version is not able to account for particle deposition, sedimentation, resuspension, and coagulation, etc. If the model is to be applied to more complex indoor environments, these influencing factors should be considered.
