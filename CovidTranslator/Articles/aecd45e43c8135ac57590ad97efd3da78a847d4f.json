This procedure is arguably the outstanding clinical biomedical accomplishment of the last 3 decades. Potent immunosuppressive drugs have dramatically reduced the incidence of rejection of transplanted organs, but have also increased the susceptibility of patients to opportunistic infections. 1 Thus, the success of organ transplantation is dependent in part on effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of infectious diseases after transplantation. To this end, emphasis is increasingly being placed on prevention. Most transplant patients will have evidence of microbial invasion in the first year after transplant. The effects of this microbial invasion are diverse, resulting in direct and indirect consequences. The direct consequences result in a variety of clinical infectious disease syndromes such as mononucleosis, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, among other entities. The indirect consequences are mediated through cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors elaborated by the transplant recipient in response to microbial replication and invasion, which contribute to the net state of immunosuppression, the pathogenesis of acute and chronic allograft injury, and in some cases, the development of lymphoproliferative or malignant disorders.",

            "text": "The risk of infection in the solid organ transplant patient is largely determined by the interaction of 3 factors: technical/anatomic factors that involve the transplant procedure itself, and the perioperative aspects of care such as the management of vascular access, drains, and the endotracheal tube; environmental exposures (Box 1); and the patient's net state of immunosuppression (Box 2). In the case of technical/anatomic mishaps, the best way to prevent infection is to correct the anatomic abnormality under coverage of appropriate antimicrobial therapy as antimicrobial treatment alone will not eliminate the risk of developing recurrent infections related to the uncorrected problem. As a consequence, the transplant recipient remains at high risk of subsequent infections with an increased risk of developing antimicrobial resistance until successful correction of the underlying abnormality. 1, 2 When one is considering therapy in the transplant patient, the concept of the therapeutic prescription package is useful. This package has 2 major components: an immunosuppressive component to prevent and treat rejection and an antimicrobial component to make it safe. Thus, the nature of the antimicrobial program being administered must be closely linked to the nature and intensity of the immunosuppressive program required and the resulting net state of immunosuppression. 1, 2 There are 3 modes in which antimicrobial agents can be administered to the transplant recipient: a therapeutic mode, in which antimicrobial agents are administered in the treatment of established clinical infection; a prophylactic mode, in which antimicrobial agents are administered to an entire population before an event to prevent the occurrence of an infection important enough to justify this intervention: and a preemptive mode, in which antimicrobial agents are administered to a subpopulation noted to be at particular risk of clinically important infection based on clinical, epidemiologic, or laboratory markers. This review focus on preventive strategies (prophylactic and preemptive) and on the diagnosis and management of established infection.",

Although some clinical syndromes, such as pneumonia, can occur at any time point after transplant, the causes may be very different at different time points. Fig. 1 delineates the timetable for the onset of infections after organ transplantation in the absence of effective preventative strategies. When preventative antimicrobial therapy fails to completely protect the patient, a common clinical effect is to extend the time period in which the infectious complication will likely appear. For example, in the case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, in the absence of prophylaxis CMVinduced clinical disease is most common 1 to 3 months after transplantation. When prophylaxis is used, but fails, it is common for the disease to occur 4 to 8 months after transplantation (depending on the nature and duration of the prophylaxis and the immunosuppressive regimen). 2, 3 Like all patients, the transplant recipient is at risk of acquiring infections in the health care and community settings. Such infections are not necessarily transplant specific. Fig. 1 is a graphical representation of the timing of infections during the posttransplant period. 2 In general, 3 time periods are recognized, each with differing forms of infection: [1] [2] [3] ",

Examples include CMV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), and the hepatitis viruses (B and C); all of which may cause disease through acquisition of primary infection (typically from the donor) or secondary infection within the recipient under the pressure of immune suppression (secondary infection includes reactivation of latent pathogens and reinfection with a new strain). The second set of pathogens observed in this time period cause socalled opportunistic infections and include organisms such as Listeria monocytogenes, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Pneumocystis jiroveci.

Similarly for liver, heart, and intestinal transplant recipients, the major fungal infections are also caused by Candida species. For all of these patients, invasive aspergillosis and other mycoses occur uncommonly. The consequences of invasive aspergillosis and other noncandidal mycoses associated with invasive infections are frequently devastating. Lung transplant recipients are unique in that they experience proportionately more infections with Aspergillus species compared with other organ recipients. These infections are often seen in children undergoing transplantation as treatment of cystic fibrosis and reflect infection with Aspergillus that was present in the recipient before transplantation. However, Aspergillus is also frequently recovered from the lungs of transplant recipients with obliterative bronchiolitis (chronic rejection of the lung) regardless of the cause of their original lung disease leading to transplantation. 21 CMV CMV infection and disease remain important causes of mortality and morbidity among pediatric organ transplant recipients. 22 Data on the precise burden in pediatric organ transplant recipients are limited, however, by wide differences in data collection and reporting. In addition, nonuniform approaches to the laboratory diagnosis and definition of CMV disease applied in retrospective studies affects the ability to interpret available data. In 5 centers in the United States, 10% to 20% of liver transplant patients experienced CMV disease within 2 years after transplantation. 23 A review of first-time pediatric lung transplant patients indicated that among at-risk subjects, the incidence of CMV viremia was 29% to 32%, whereas the incidence of CMV pneumonitis was 20% during the first year after transplantation. 24, 25 CMV disease is often associated with fever and hematologic abnormalities, including leucopenia, atypical lymphocytosis, and thrombocytopenia. Visceral sites affected may include the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and liver. Central nervous system involvement, including chorioretinitis, is rare in organ transplant recipients.",

Currently, when antiviral agents are used to treat EBV, the agent of choice is ganciclovir, as in vitro it is 10 times more active against EBV compared with acyclovir. The controversy on the use of these agents for EBV/PTLD arises because although these agents can suppress EBV lytic infection, Infections After Organ Transplantation they seem to be of limited value in treatment nonlytic EBV proliferation, which is believed to be the dominant component of EBV-related PTLD. Increasing evidence (albeit anecdotal) supports the use of the anti-CD20 monoclonal rituximab in the treatment of EBV disease and PTLD. However, the optimal timing and treatment strategy for this agent remain to be defined. Additional alternative strategies such as the use of chemotherapy require collaborative input from oncologists familiar with the management of EBV-related disease in organ transplant recipients.

[63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] Wherever possible, vaccines should be administered in the pretransplant period to improve the chances of optimal immunologic take. A guideline on vaccinations for the transplant candidate/patient has recently been published. 73 In some situations, accelerated vaccination schedules may be used for selected vaccines. Given differences in childhood vaccination schedules in different jurisdictions, clinicians should acquaint themselves with the appropriate schedules and the circumstances under which accelerated schedules could be used. When using vaccines after transplantation, one needs to be concerned about safety as well as efficacy. In general, all live virus vaccines should be avoided in the transplant recipient. The oral polio, yellow fever, and oral typhoid vaccines are live and are contraindicated in immunosuppressed patients. The live attenuated intranasal influenza vaccine is also contraindicated. Measles, mumps, and rubella vaccines are somewhat contraindicated and their use should be limited to outbreak scenarios. The varicella vaccine is also somewhat contraindicated and is not approved for use in transplant patents. Although limited published data support the potential use of this vaccine in transplant recipients, 72 most experts continue to advise against this practice. In the cases of the nonlive vaccines, the major concern is not safety, but efficacy. Thus, in general, it is advisable to give nonlive vaccines at times when the level of immunosuppression would allow for immunogenicity. Table 3 summarizes the vaccines that are indicated and contraindicated in transplant recipients. Given the relative burden and importance of invasive pneumococcal disease in pediatric transplant recipients, the importance of pneumococcal vaccination should not be underestimated. 17, 63, 69 Donor Organ Screening",

Accordingly, screening of the donor organ is a crucial aspect of the preventive strategies aimed at minimizing adverse outcomes from infections in the posttransplant period. Despite a long-standing recognition of the importance of donor-derived infections, increased concern about this problem has emerged because of recent donor-related transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This case, as well as concerns about the lack of sensitivity of serologic testing and the relatively long time period until seroconversion against HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV), have led to interest in the use of NAT-based testing for the pathogens HIV, HCV, and HBV. Although arguments exist for and against the use of NAT testing, a final international consensus addressing if and when to use these tests is only beginning to emerge. 74 Decisions relating to the use of such tests must consider not only the reliability of this technology but also the feasibility of universal implementation of these testing procedures for all procurement organizations. Recent cases of donor-associated transmission of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and West Nile virus have also raised questions on whether the panel of routine tests performed on potential donors should be expanded to include these and other potential donorderived pathogens. To date, a consensus has not been reached on whether or not screening against these pathogens should be routinely included in donor testing panels. It is to be hoped that the implementation of working groups and committees focusing on the problem of donor-derived infections in North America and Europe will lead to improved data to better inform subsequent recommendations regarding donor testing. Current requirements for screening of nonliving donors are shown in Table 4 . At present, no specific requirements have been implemented for screening",

For example, as discussed earlier, the most likely causes of infection within the first month after transplantation are often bacterial or candidal and are largely similar to what is seen in nonimmunosuppressed patients who have undergone comparable surgery. The nature of the evaluation will depend on the clinical status of the patient and whether or not a source of infection has been identified. Examination abnormal, focus of infection defined. Admission to hospital may be indicated depending on the clinical status of the patient and the site of the infection.
