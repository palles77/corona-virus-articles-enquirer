For the first time the assessment was conducted using an improved panel regression model by taking into account of the detailed opening schedules of various HSR services during the period 2001-2014. The research findings reveal that the deployed HSR services have a significant substitutional effect on domestic air transportation in China, but the effect varies across different HSR routes, travel distance and city type. Specifically, the research found a decrease in domestic passengers of 28.2%, in flights of 24.6% and in seat capacity of 27.9% after the introduction of HSR services. The impacts are found much stronger among those air routes that connect major hub within a distance range of 500 to 800 km. The uneven nature of the impact can be seen in the different experiences of selected cities. For example, air travel declined approximately 45% after commencement of the Wuhan-Guangzhou HSR, whereas it fell by 34% after the opening of the Beijing-Shanghai HSR.",

            "text": "The domestic intercity transport system experienced a revolutionary transformation in China during the past decade with the development of high-speed rail (HSR) in the early 2000s. Unlike any HSR in the world, the HSR in China now has the largest network consisting of eight east-west-bound and eight north-south-bound HSR passenger dedicated lines (PDL), with a total track length of over 19,000 km. These new high-speed train services generally operate on dedicated track which can allow operating speeds of 250 km/h or even higher. Because of this high transport capacity and travel speed, the intercity travel demand may have been induced considerably. For instance, as illustrated in Fig. 1 , the passenger railway demand has experienced a rapid growth from 2003 to 2013. The ridership on travel distances ranging from 101 to 501 km experienced the fastest growth. In terms of passenger-km traveled, distances over a thousand km accounted for the largest share of the total passenger-km traveled, however, it is actually the rail trip ranging from 501 to 1000 km that increased the most. These statistics confirm that passenger rail travel in China has changed fundamentally in the past decade, which may have serious consequences for air transport.",

For instance, as indicated by Chen and Haynes (2015) , the Air Express service between Chengdu and Chongqing was discontinued in November 2009 after nineteen years of operation following the opening of the intercity HSR serving the same corridor. One month later, the operation of the Wuhan-Guangzhou HSR led to the cancellation of the Hainan Airline's service between those two cities. One year later, the operation of Zhengzhou-Xi'an HSR also led to a cancellation of all air services between the two cities in March 2010. It is likely that the impact upon air transportation services may be felt in more services as additional HSR services are provided.",

Considering an \"ideal\" travel time for an intercity trip can range from one to 4 hours (Givoni, 2006) , HSR, which normally runs at a speed of over 250 km/h or higher, is considered competitive for trips between 160 and 800 km (Button, 2012) , whereas air is preferable for a longer distance. Market characteristics reflect the values that travelers place upon travel cost and time, and also reflect the size of the cities involved in the link.

First, since most HSR services in China were opened recently (after 2010), there is a lack of sufficient data to capture the dynamic response of aviation service to the new competition Second, the assessment of the temporal and spatial evolution of the Chinese HSR system is challenging due to the complicated nature of its construction. Since the development of such a gigantic infrastructure system involves a multistage planning, financing and construction, the HSR lines have been completed at different times. As a result, it is difficult to generalize about the effect of competition between HSR and domestic air transportation. To capture the completion effect more accurately, we need timelines of HSR opening schedules as well as matching air transport data to provide an informed empirical assessment of impacts, and to predict likely future effects.",

The classical approach involves an assessment from a supply perspective (Dobruszkes, 2011) Gleave, 2006) , which suggest that the competition between HSR and air is limited to the medium-distance travel market. Givoni and Dobruszkes (2013) extended this thinking by suggesting the majority of the HSR demand is from induced demand and the substitution of demand from conventional trains, so that one-on-one comparisons with air are more complicated than first thought.",

On the supply side Albalate et al. (2015) conducted an econometric analysis based on a dataset of air services in Spain. Their study confirms that the supply of airline service measured in number of seats did reduce after the operation of HSR, however, when the supply of air service was measured in flight frequency, the result shows that air service did not suffer a significant reduction. On the demand side, Behrens and Pels (2012) assessed the competition between HSR and air using enplanement as a proxy.

(2016, 534-535 Difference-in-difference Mean airfare for the routes along the Jing-Hu HSR declined by 29% after the opening of the HSR underestimated given that the research only included two-years after 2010. This also reflects the fact that the treated/control group ratio is very small. In fact, as illustrated in Table 2 , there were only four major HSR PDLs (with a distance of over 400 km) in operation by the end of 2012 (excluding those opened in the fourth quarter of 2012). All these suggest that their estimation tends to be biased due to the limited number of HSRs included as part of their analysis. Second, differencein-difference (DID) is not an appropriate method for the evaluation of HSR in China. One of the key assumptions of the DID approach is that the control group and the treated group should have parallel trends over time in the absence of the treatment. In effect, the approach is more appropriate to a short-term scenario. As discussed earlier, HSR development in China has spanned at least five years, or longer in some locations. The entire HSR network covers over 28 provinces and municipalities but many HSR routes began operation on different dates. As a result, it becomes quite challenging to separate the HSR effect from the control group if the DID approach is adopted. In sum, this review point to the need for a new approach that can accommodate the complex space and time context of the Chinese experience.",

As shown in Fig. 3 (a) and (c), both the demand and supply of the air service along this corridor experienced a substantial decline after the opening of HSR in December 2009. For instance, from 2009 to 2012, the air travel demand between Guangzhou -Changsha decreased by 67%, while flights declined by 55% and between Shenzhen -Changsha demand fell 68% while flights declined 53% (Chen and Haynes, 2015) .",

However, the competitive effect of the HSR on air travel from Beijing and Shanghai has been different. It has experienced a decline after the HSR operation, but that decline is not as intensive as on the other routes, and is showing a trend to recover its earlier level. This may be attributed to a very strong demand for intercity travel between Beijing and Shanghai due to the complex and high level economic and political functions of both cities, which makes this the busiest air route within China. Once again, on this line, there is some evidence of a shift back to air services in links between Shanghai and Tianjin and Beijing and Nanjing.",

(2015) ) have suggested that the level of impact of HSR on air service can be different given differences in city type. For example, in Europe, the reduction of air service in a hub city tends to be greater than in a non-hub city. Hence, it will be valuable to test whether such a hypothesis is valid in China. Second, a distance-effect analysis is introduced. The motivation for this aspect is the inconsistent distance band adopted in the literature. Some studies suggested that HSR has a compelling advantage over automobile and air for a travel distance ranging from 160 to 800 km (Button, 2012) , whereas other scholars pointed out the most effective distance for HSR to compete with air is 200-600 km (Vickerman, 1997) while Wan et al. (2016) adopted 500 km as the lower bound and 800 km as the upper bound. Scholars tend to agree that the optimal competitive distance of HSR is 3-4 h (Fu et al., 2012) beyond which air transport is favored by the majority of travelers. That still leaves a large distance for competition, especially at high speeds. So the 3-4 h band translates into 750-1000 km at 250 km/h but reaches out to 900-1200 km at 300 km/ h. It is clear that distance is a key consideration here.",

The primary data such as enplanement, flight frequencies and seat capacities are collected from the annual statistics of aviation publication From a Statistical Look at the Civil Aviation for the period 2001-2014. The raw data contains 792 domestic airline routes with a total number of 6263 observations. However, the dataset is unbalanced as quite a few air routes only have data statistics in one or two years. Hence, to achieve a consistent panel assessment, a data filtering process is implemented to exclude those air service routes with observations of less than a decade. The cleaned data after this filtering includes 3834 observations with 295 OD city pairs. The level of competition between HSR and air is measured by the estimated elasticity of demand and supply changes in air transportation after the operation of HSR through the following equations: ",

These somewhat contradictory results can be reconciled from the following three respects: First, a comparison of the percent change of air demand between Sections 3 and 6 doesn't make sense because the former was based on descriptive statistics, whereas the latter was derived from econometric analysis. The magnitude of impact from econometric analysis is subject to various factors, such as model specifications, control variables and estimation methods being introduced. Second, the statement refers to a city-pair rather than a single city.

However, the analysis did find impacts are relatively larger than those found in early studies, which may reflect the fact that the Chinese HSR is in fact playing a significant role in transforming the nation's inter-city travel market. One should also note that as more people begin to travel by HSR, and as the network continues to grow, its impacts on domestic air transportation are expected to be even more substantial. Two implications can be drawn from the research findings. First, given that HSR is the most competitive mode for the medium-distance intercity travel that connects major cities that have a hub function within a distance of 500-800 km, future planning and development of HSR should give preference to those corridors that meet such conditions to maximize the utilization and return on investment to the rail system. Second, given that HSR is likely to play a dominant role on the mediumdistance travel market whereas air may still be a major player in the long-distance market in China, future planning should recognize that creating seamless connections between rail and air will make an important contribution to an economically sustainable and effective transportation system in China.",
