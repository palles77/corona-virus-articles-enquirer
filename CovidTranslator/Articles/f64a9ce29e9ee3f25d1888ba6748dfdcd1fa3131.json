However, the function of 3CL pro in host cells remains unknown. This study investigated how the 3CL pro affected the secretion of cytokines in the gene-transfected cells. Results: From immunofluorescence microscopy, the localization of c-myc tagged 3CL pro was detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected A549 cells. Expression of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was significantly decreased in 3CL pro -transfected cells by both RT-PCR and ELISA, but without changes in other cytokines, i.e., IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL12p40, TNF-\u03b1, and TGF-\u03b2. Furthermore, the protein levels of NF-kB decreased in 3CL pro -transfected A549 cells when compared to EGFP transfected cells.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emerged as a communicable human disease in November 2002 and rapidly spread throughout the world [1] . A coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the causative agent [2, 3] . SARS-CoV is a plus-strand RNA virus featuring a large single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 29.7 kb [4] that contains 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) with multiple enzymatic functions. These are known or are predicted to include types of enzymes that are common components of the replication machinery of plus-strand RNA viruses [5, 6] . In these nsps, the Nsp5 [main protease (M pro ) or 3C-like protease (3CL pro )] is responsible for the proteolytic processing of viral polypeptides into functional proteins and 3CL pro mutant, C145A, blocks the maturation process [7] . This viral protease has been the target for design of the inhibitors [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Recently, SARS-3CL pro was found to induce cell apotosis and interact with cellular vacuolar-H + ATPase [12, 13] . Several human proteins might possess a similar structure of SARS-3CL pro cleavage sites using computational methods [14] . Theses studies implied the SARS-3CL pro could involve in virusinduced host pathology.",

SARS-CoV reproduces rapidly and causes massive cell damage. At the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and, perhaps, autoimmunity [23, 24] , may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of SARS. One of the major causes of host death is the induction of lung fibrosis. The mechanism of the lung fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV requires elucidation. Significant efforts have been made to analyze the function of SARS-3CL pro on viral replication, but the impact of SARS-3CL pro on cytokines of the host cell is still unclear. In this study, we constructed the pEGFP-C3 vector with SARS-3CL pro gene and transfected it into A549 lung epithelial cells. The expression profiles of cytokines were validated by RT-PCR and ELISA. The results indicated that the expression and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) decrease in SARS-3CL pro transfected A549 cells. Furthermore, NF-kB, putative regulators of GM-CSF gene expression, was also decreased on its protein level in 3CL pro transfected cells.",

The expression levels of 3CL pro and C145A mRNA were determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and the protein expression levels were analyzed using 2D western blots (Figure 2A and 2B). The results indicated that the expression of 3CL pro and C145A mRNA reached the highest level in A549 cells at 12 to 24 hrs and slightly decreased their expression at 48 h after transfection. However, 2D western blots results indicated that the protein expression levels of 3CL pro and C145A steadily increased with time up to 48 hrs after transfection. To track the locations of 3CL pro and C145A proteins in transfected A549 cells, Myc-tagged 3CL pro and C145A were detected using rhodamineconjugated anti-Myc antibodies. The immunofluorescence microscopic images demonstrated 60-70% transfection efficiency (data not shown) and the localizations of c-myc tagged 3CL pro and C145A were detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected A549 cells compared to control EGFP ( Figure 3 ). compared to the EGFP transfected A549 cells at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hrs is 9%, 17%, 25%, 49%, and 56%, respectively.

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes a severe lung infection [18] [19] [20] . It is important to elucidate the mechanism of the lung fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV. The expression of 3CL pro and C145A in A549 cells was established (Figures 2 and 3 ) to elucidate the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV in lung epithelial cells. The localization patterns of 3CL pro and C145A were observed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of A549 cells by immunofluorescence ( Figure 3 ). Decreased expression and levels of GM-CSF were found in 3CL protransfected cells using RT-PCR, but not in C145A transfected cells (Figure 2A ). Down-regulation of GM-CSF expression by 3CL pro in A549 cells may be attributed in part to the reduced protein level of NF-kB ( Figure 6 ). In addition, there were no significant decreases in the mRNA expression of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL12p40, TNF-\u03b1, TGF-\u03b2 using RT-MPCR. This finding is consistent with that of Ziegler et al [27] who reported no induction of cytokines genes (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IL-28, IL-29, TNF-\u03b1, CCLl5 or CXCL10) or IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2-induced MxA gene in SARS-CoV-infected A549 cells. GM-CSF was originally defined by its ability to generate in vitro granulocyte and macrophage colonies from bone marrow precursor cells [28] . Apart from its physiological role in the control of alveolar macrophage development, it now appears more likely that its major role lies in its ability to govern the properties of the more mature myeloid cells of the granulocyte and macrophage lineages, particularly during host defense and inflammatory reactions. Recent evidence for the key role of GM-CSF in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is summarized [29] . GM-CSF-deficient mice showed an increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections [30, 31] . In addition, some studies also demonstrated that impaired production of GM-CSF played a role in the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis [32, 33] . Together, there is growing evidence suggesting that GM-CSF is an important regulator of the alveolar epithelium, surfactant homeostasis, and lung host defense [31, 34] . To support the above, our experimental results show decreased expression and secretion of GM-CSF in 3CL pro -transfected cells, and suggest that SARS-3CL pro will affect host defense.",

This method is an accurate and valid system to detect multiple gene expression by amplifying all the genes under the same conditions. The PCR derived DNA fragments, obtained by 25 PCR cycles, and was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1.7% agarose gel. The cDNAs encoding human granulocyte-macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and GAPDH were amplified by RT-PCR using the following primer pairs: 5'-TGAGTAGA-GACACTGCTGCTG-3' (forward primer for GM-CSF cDNAs), 5'-TCAAAGGGGATGACAAGCAGAA-3' (reverse primer for GM-CSF cDNAs), 5'-CATGTTCGT-CATGGGTGTGA-3' (forward primer for GAPDH cDNAs), and 5'-AGTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGCTC-3' (reverse primer for GAPDH cDNAs).

Following staining with ethidium bromide, the gels were photographed and band intensity was measured under UV light using the Alphaimager 2200 (Alphalnnotech, San Leandro, CA, USA).

RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of various cytokines and chemokines including IL-1\u03b2 (343 bp), IL-6 (403 bp), IL-8 (471 bp), IL12p40 (239 bp), TNF-\u03b1 (288 bp), TGF-\u03b2 (148 bp), GM-CSF (195 bp). GAPDH was used as control. A549 cells were used as the background. (B) Expression of GM-CSF in 3CL pro transfected A549 cells using RT-PCR. Total RNA was harvested at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hrs. RT-PCR was performed to detect the mRNA expression of GM-CSF (277 bp). GAPDH was used to normalize the cell number (307 bp). There were marked decreases of GM-CSF in 3CL pro transfected A549 cells after 24 hrs (*; p < 0.05). A549 cells were used as the background.

Amplified DNA fragments were then ligated into the cloning site of the pEGFP-C3 vector (EGFP) and transformed Decreased secretion of GM-CSF in SARS-CoV-3CL pro transfected cells. A549 cells were transfected with EGFP or 3CL pro or C145A plasmids. The supernatants were collected from cell cultures at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hrs and ELISA was performed to evaluate the amount of secreted GM-CSF. The supernatant from the cell culture of A549 cells was used as a control. A significant decrease of GM-CSF was observed in 3CL pro or C145A transfected A549 cells (p = 0.0204 and 0.0236 respectively).",
