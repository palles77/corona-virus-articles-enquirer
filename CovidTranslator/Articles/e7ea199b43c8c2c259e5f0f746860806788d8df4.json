Well-known epidemics such as the bubonic plague, AIDS, the Ebola virus in the 1980s, the influenza pandemic of 1918, and presently, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has seriously affected us. 1 SARS was first identified in February 2003 by an Italian expert, Carlo Urbani and his early work to detect SARS has heightened the global surveillance level and made many The defensive move the human will take against this disease can only be established among scientists with sufficient communications. The most common mean is through publication. 4 Garfield in 1970 also observed that a recent research focus can be reflected on its publication output. 5 Hence, a dramatic increase of SARS-related publications would be expected shortly after the outbreak. This study was intended to analyze significant SARS publication patterns, especially in international collaboration and authors' country of origin in the beginning stage of SARS outbreak.",

Then, we checked the search result to make sure that all entries were related to the SARS topic. Analysis parameters include authorship, patterns of international collaboration, journals, language, document type, research institutional address, times cited, and reprint address. Citation analysis was partly based on Journal Impact Factors, as defined by Journal Citation Report (JCR) for the journals actually published the SARS articles (Table 1) partly on the number of citations received per publication during the period studied in 2003, and relative to the average citation impact of the SARS publications covering the same period ( Table 2 ). The average citation impact, corresponding to a kind of Immediacy Index for SARS, 2003, was 0.735 citations per published article with research institutional address (97 cit./132 publ.), January-July, 2003.",

Total production was 256 papers by 38 countries with 48% being absent in recorded address. Thirty-two percent of total share was published as news features, 25% as editorial materials, 22% as articles, 13% as letters, and the remaining being biographic items, corrections, meeting abstracts, and reprints. Similar to the finding of a study on drug and alcohol journals, 6 the quantity of SARSrelated articles were found to be low. That a high percentage share of news item was found might be a faster way of communication. As shown in Table 1 , 256 documents were published in 64 SCI journals, with 61% Northern American journals, 20% in European journals, 5% in Asian journals and 3% with no records in JCR of 2002. Four journals had impact factors higher than 20, 4 journals impact factors between 10 and 20, 4 between 5 and 10, 24 between 1 and 5, and 26 below 1. Fifty-seven percent of the documents was published in journals with impact factors higher than 5. The US dominated the journal countries followed distantly by the UK. Four languages were used for all SCI publications. Ninety-eight percent of total journals was published in English. Only 3 journals published in German, 2 in Spanish, and 1 in French.",

            "text": "Domination in publication was not surprising from mainstream countries since this pattern has occurred in most scientific fields. 7, 8 High production in countries with many cases would be due to active research of the disease, mainly on identification, diagnosis, and treatment. Contra wise mainstream countries would focus on controlling the disease and developing possible drugs and vaccines. The number of SARS cases did not affect the SCI publication output. However, countries with SARS cases, especially China, may have published in non-SCI journals that were not included in this study. All documents in this study were published in English. Thus, scientists in non-English speaking countries may have disadvantages in publishing in SCI journals since English is lingua franca of science. 9,10 In a short period of time, English may not be the choice of communication language for those scientists who are not native speakers. Publishing was from Europe and Asia besides two Northern American countries. In our study, we found that only 17% of SARS-related papers were internationally collaborated. This finding is unusual since international collaboration is essential in modern science. 11 Although citation by other authors was affected significantly by visibility, 12 the citation frequency of SARS-related articles was considered to be high. Papers published from 11 countries had been cited in the short period after its appearance in print published. The country with the highest ACI value of 4.54 was the Netherlands. Except the US and the UK, all other countries have ACI higher than 1. The finding that low ACI values of these two countries was surprising because that both they had not had many reported SARS cases. In the ACI ranking, number of SARS cases has affected citation pattern. Hong Kong, where had the serious SARS outbreak and the sequencing of corona virus been completed, has the most impact to this field. Further analysis show that there is no evidence of association between number of national SARS cases and article production (Pearson r = 0.130, p value = 0.437), national citations received (Pearson r = 0.248, p value = 0.134), and national citation impact (Pearson r = -0.046, p value = 0.835). In our study, we found that 48% of publications have no recorded reprint addresses. The sum of 21 countries was counted for the remaining ones distributed 9 in Asia, 7 in Europe, 2 in Northern America, and 1 in Africa, Central America, and Australia. Countries with reprint addresses showed similar publication and citation patterns as the origin of countries. The high percentage of documents that appeared without reprint addresses may be due to the low production of articles because other document types may not include them. The US dominated the number of publications and Hong Kong that of citation ( Figure 1 ). Mainstream countries, the US, Canada, the UK, and Germany, published 81 (61%) papers. The reprint address often represents the location when the research was done. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that most SARS research was done in the US, but that 10 papers had reprint address at the Chinese University at Hong Kong, 9 at University of Hong Kong, 7 at Center of Disease Control at Atlanta, 4 at WHO at Switzerland and Prince Wales Hospital in Hong Kong. Therefore, Hong Kong ranked the top for reprint address production.",
