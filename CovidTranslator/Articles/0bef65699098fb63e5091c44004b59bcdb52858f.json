Bird meats were the source of 9 virus-containing samples (5 quail, 2 moor hens, and 2 water cocks), which indicates a risk for infl uenza virus (H5N1) contamination in bird meats, especially quail. In addition, 3 highly pathogenic avian infl uenza viruses were isolated from healthy live poultry (1 chicken and 2 ducks). However, the samples that contained infl uenza virus subtype H5N1 were detected only during the 3-month winter season (November-January). A possible explanation for virus contamination in live bird and food markets may be animal movement from outbreak areas to the markets as well as an attempt to sell infected (dead or dying) birds, especially quail, as bird meat. In addition, most animals or meats in the markets came from backyard farms, where they were in unavoidably close contact with wild birds.",

The HA cleavage site consists of multiple basic amino acids RE-RRRKKR (in 1 isolate, CU-329, REKRRKKR). All infl uenza subtype viruses harbor Glu-222 and Gly-224 at the receptor binding site, indicating preferential binding to the avian receptor SA-\u03b1-2, 3-Gal. In addition, the virus sequences contain 7 glycosylation sites as previously identifi ed in most isolates from Thailand (6) . A glycosylation site adjacent to receptor binding sites may help increase virus infectivity in host cells (7) . In some isolates, polymorphisms of amino acids related to antigenic properties of the viruses at position V86A, L138Q, and K140N were observed. All 12 subtype H5N1 viruses had a 20-aa deletion in the NA protein, typical for the NA stalk region of recent subtype H5N1 isolates (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (8, 9) . None of the subtype H5N1 isolates had any amino acids indicating oseltamivir resistance at the crucial positions 119 (E), 275",

In summary, the 12 viruses isolated from this study were similar to the viruses from other sources in Thailand, which indicates that the viruses are endemic to Thailand, are circulating in the country, and can be found in any exposed species. The route of infl uenza virus (H5N1) introduction into the markets remains to be established. We suspect that this contamination might have occurred as a consequence of animal movement from outbreak areas or from viruscontaminated cages, trucks, and equipment. Unfortunately, the original sources of animals in the markets could not be identifi ed because birds from different sources were housed in 1 or several cages. Fortunately, no human infection was found during 2007-2008 in those provinces where the viruses were isolated.",
