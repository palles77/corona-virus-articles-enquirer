Pre-existing antibody titres (as a result of natural infection) in the serum of these animals were found to be signi\u00aecantly increased as a result of a single shot vaccination carried out between 2 and 12 weeks before calving. This was re\u00afected in a similar increase in the titre and duration of speci\u00aec antibody in milk and colostrum that was passed on to the calves. The overall response observed was highly dependent on an adequate antigen payload being incorporated within the single dose vaccine. No abnormal local or systemic reactions were observed as a result of vaccination. It is hoped that this approach will lead to the production of a superior commercial vaccine for the protection of neonatal calves against enteric coronavirus infection. 7",

In calves, economic losses are suered as a result of mortality, which can reach up to 80%, and also veterinary costs and decreased productivity of survivors. The viral agents most commonly associated with this syndrome are rotavirus and coronavirus, both of which have been shown to be primary pathogens in calves [4, 5] . Although this syndrome is most overtly associated with young animals, subclinical infections are also common in adults which may therefore act as reservoirs for reinfection [6] .",

This can be achieved by allowing the neonate to ingest colostrum or milk containing these speci\u00aec antibodies from its dam (lactogenic immunity). Although most adult cattle are seropositive for both rotavirus and coronavirus antibodies [7] , during the transition from colostrum to milk production there is a dramatic decline in antibody titres which partially explains the high incidence of infection in calves older than 5 days. Successful rotavirus vaccines aimed at increasing both the titre and duration of speci\u00aec antibody in both colostrum and milk have been developed [8] , however, similar success has not been reported with vaccines targeted against bovine coronavirus [9\u00b113] .",

After washing, 200 ml of an optimal concentration of a horseradish peroxidase -conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Nordic Immunologicals) was added to each well and incubated with shaking for a further 1 h at 378C. After washing, bound conjugate was visualised using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) as the chromagen. After stopping the reaction using 2.5 M sulphuric acid, the optical density (492 nm) was proportional to the amount of bovine coronavirus antigen in the sample. Full quantitation up to a range of 100 antigen units per ml was achieved by including a set of six standards in each assay.",

Since virus neutralisation is the key parameter involved in protection by lactogenic immunity, antibody titres were only determined by VN. With the exception of study B, the serum VN antibody levels of the placebo groups did not change signi\u00aecantly during the course of the experiment. In study B however, 33% (5/15) of placebo treated animals showed an increase in serum VN antibody levels of log 10 0X5\u00b11X0 during the experiment suggesting that`wild type' BCoV was circulating within the herd. After immunisation, serum VN antibody levels in the vaccinated groups showed a signi\u00aecant p`0X05 increase in serum VN antibody levels compared with those observed in the placebo control groups. Mean serum VN antibody levels were increased by at least log 10 0X5 by 14 days post-vaccination and these levels were typically maintained until calving. Associated with this increase in serum VN antibody levels, \u00aerst day colostrum VN antibody was also signi\u00aecantly higher log 10 0X5\u00b10X8 in the test vaccine groups compared with the placebo control groups. Similar dierences were maintained in milk antibody throughout the period of study (up to day 4 on the dairy farms and up to day 28 on the beef suckler farms). The smallest increase occurred in study B where sero-conversion amongst the placebo treated animals was observed (Fig. 2b) . Serum taken from calves allowed to suckle vaccinated dams showed that levels of circulating VN antibody were up to ten-fold higher than those obtained from calves suckling placebo-vaccinated cows.",

There appear to be some minor dierences in the pattern of the antibody responses determined by either HAI or VN in that the HAI responses peak later than the VN responses. This may re\u00afect dierences in antibody anity or sub-class requirements between the two methods of antibody measurement. In terms of neutralising antibody, the major eect of increasing antigen content appears to be in the duration rather than the magnitude of the response. With a vaccine dose containing 190 antigen units of antigen the response was rapid, reaching a plateau approximately 14 days post-vaccination which was maintained until at least 84 days post-vaccination. With a dose containing 38 antigen units of antigen, the virus neutralisation response was equally rapid and of similar magnitude, although in contrast declining rapidly to 84 days post-vaccination. Selection of the correct antigen load therefore appears critical in ensuring an optimal window in terms of the interval between vaccination and calving. An additional advantage in using a higher antigen dose was also demonstrated in cow / calf study B where elevated antibody responses were still observed even in the face of circulating infection. This suggests that vaccination could still play a signi\u00aecant role in enhancing overall herd immunity even in an active disease situation. Fig. 2 .

The initial serology data therefore suggested that with a BCoV antigen load of approximately 190 antigen units, successful vaccination could take place at any time between 2 and 12 weeks pre-calving. This hypothesis was supported by the observations on the magnitude of the antibody titres found in the colostrum and milk of cows vaccinated at dierent times pre-calving with a vaccine containing 150 antigen units of BCoV.

Although this would be expected to adversely aect the statistical testing of the results, signi\u00aecant dierences p b 0X05 between test and control groups were found on the majority of days tested. This contrasts strongly with previously reported studies wherein increases in BCoV antibody titre in serum or milk following vaccination were either minimal or non-existent [9\u00b113]. The reasons for the improved responses observed with the test vaccine are related both to the concentration of BCoV antigen present and the use of an oil adjuvant, which have generally been reported to be highly eective in the enhancement of rotavirus antibody titres in mammary secretions [8] .",
