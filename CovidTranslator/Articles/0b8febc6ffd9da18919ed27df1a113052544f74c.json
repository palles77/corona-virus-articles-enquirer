Low-level expression of the brome mosaic virus (BMV) CP was found to stimulate viral RNA accumulation, while higher levels inhibited translation and BMV RNA replication. Regulation of translation acts through an RNA element named the B box, which is also critical for the replicase assembly. The BMV CP has also been shown to preferentially bind to an RNA element named SLC that contains the core promoter for genomic minus-strand RNA synthesis. To further elucidate CP interaction with RNA, Available online we used a reversible cross-linking-peptide fingerprinting assay to identify 27 May 2009 peptides in the capsid that contact the SLC, the B-box RNA, and the encapsidated RNA. Transient expression of three mutations made in residues within or close by the cross-linked peptides partially released the normal inhibition of viral RNA accumulation in agroinfiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana. Interestingly, two of the mutants, R142A and D148A, were found to retain the ability to down-regulate reporter RNA translation. These two mutants formed viral particles in inoculated leaves, but only R142Awas able to move systemically in the inoculated plant. The R142A CP was found to have higher affinities for SLC and the B box compared with those of wild-type CP and to alter contacts to the RNA in the virion. These results better define how the BMV CP can interact with RNA and regulate different viral processes.",

A model summarizing some of the effects of the CP on BMV gene expression is shown in Fig. 1a . The inhibitory effect of the CP occurs at least partially through the suppression of the translation of the replication proteins through the B-box motif in the 5\u2032-UTRs of BMV RNA1 and RNA2. 10 Interestingly, the B box is also required to interact with the 1a protein to form the membrane-associated BMV replicase, suggesting a link between the regulation of translation and BMV replicase formation. The CP can also bind to the SLC motif that contains the core promoter to direct minus-strand RNA synthesis, 11 a motif that contains a stem-triloop where two of the loop nucleotides stack with the stem and a key adenine base protrudes out into solution called a clamped adenine motif. 12, 13 Since RNA binding is a key to CP contribution to numerous regulatory events, we wanted to better define how the CP interacts with different RNAs involved in the regulation of translation, RNA replication, and RNA encapsidation using a reversible cross-linking, affinity purification, and peptide-fingerprinting assay by mass spectrometry (MS) (henceforth called RCAP). 14 The mapping data led to the identification of three mutations in the BMV CP that differentially affect the inhibition of translation and the repression of viral RNA accumulation.",

            "text": "To further understand how CP-RNA interaction is involved in regulation of translation and replication, we sought to identify mutations in the CP that could impact the regulatory effects on BMV RNA accumulation. RCAP was used to map CP binding to the B-box RNA motif (19 nucleotides) 10 and to SLD4 (25 nucleotides), a derivative of SLC ( Fig. 1a and Refs. 12 , 16 , and 17 ). Briefly, formaldehyde was used to cross-link the CP to an RNA that has been covalently attached to an inert resin through a 5\u2032 amino group (Fig. 2a) . The cross-linked complex was then subjected to trypsin cleavage, followed by extensive washing and purification of the RNA resin to remove noncovalently associated peptides. The bound peptides were released from the RNA resin by reversing the cross-links and were identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-ToF) MS and matched to the expected trypsin fragmentation pattern of the CP. Versions of this method were employed to generate a map of how several RNA-binding proteins can contact RNA and were further modified to chemically synthesize RNA coupled to resin. 14, 19, 20 The reactions led to robust signals reproducibly above background (Fig. 2b) . Several of the peptides were nested due to missed cleavage at lysines and arginines by trypsin, as would happen when the RNA prevents cleavage. The nested peptides increased confidence in the assignments of the peptides. Both SLD4 and the B-box RNAs contacted several portions of the BMV CP (Fig. 2c) . The 25 N-terminal residues of the CP, a known RNA-binding sequence, 21, 22 did not produce peptides. The remaining two-thirds of the capsid formed a more globular structure and a C-terminal stub ( Fig. 2d and e) . The two RNAs were associated with three identical peptides (from residues 90-103, residues 131-142, and residues 166-189), but SLD4 was associated with a unique peptide from residues 27-41 and the B-box motif was associated with a peptide from residues 143-165 ( Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2 ).",

BMV RNA1 and RNA2 introduced by Agrobacterium can replicate in N. benthamiana in the absence of RNA3. 9 Furthermore, transient expression of the WT CP could regulate RNA1 and RNA2 accumulations in a concentration-dependent manner. 9,10 Therefore, we examined whether the CP could affect BMV RNA1 and RNA2 accumulations. A range concentration of the three mutant CPs was tested along with BMV RNA1 and RNA2. At an OD 595 of 0.2, the WT CP reduced RNA1 accumulation to 49%, while the presence of the three mutants resulted in BMV RNAs at levels in excess of the absence of CP (Fig. 5 ). At all ranges of inoculum tested, the three mutant CPs resulted in higher levels of BMV RNA1 and RNA2 accumulations.

In a denaturing gel, RNA4 was also abundantly represented in the preparations that had virions (G. Yi, unpublished data). These results show that the mutation in vD148A renders it unable to infect systemically even though there was no obvious effect on RNA packaging.",

While single-virus-particle reconstruction with vR142A did not reveal any defects in virion structure, we wanted to assess whether interaction with the packaged RNA was affected. A differential scanning fluorimetry assay was used to assess the stability of the vR142A relative to WT virions. In this assay, the virion was subjected to a controlled increase in temperature in the presence of the dye SYPRO orange, which fluoresces in the presence of hydrophobic environment, such as denatured proteins. The temperature at the greatest transition in fluorescence is thus an apparent T m for the sample. vR142A had a T m value (77.3 \u00b0C) reproducibly lower than that of the WT BMV (79.5 \u00b0C) at pH 7.0 (Fig. 8a ), implying that vR142A had thermal dynamic properties distinguishable from the WT BMV. In this assay, a difference of 1 \u00b0C can be interpreted to be significant. 27 We used the RCAP assay to gain further insight into the effect of the R142A substitution on interaction with the virion RNA. Several peptides were identical in the R142A and the WT virions, such as those containing residues 27-64 and residues 166-189 ( Supplementary Fig.  3 ). Interestingly, vR142A lacked peptide 21-26 that was observed in the WT virion, while the R142A virion had two additional peptides, one that extended the block of residues from the N-terminal arginine-rich motif (residues 65-81) and another in the central portion of the CP (residues 112-130) (Fig. 8b) . In the context of the models of the BMV virion, the locations of the RNA-cross-linked peptides in vR142A are obviously distinct from those in the WT (Fig.  8c) . While the effects of the mutations could be complex, these results indicate that the R142A qualitatively affected CP recognition of RNA in the context of virions.",

With only seven mutations in the CP, we were surprised to find that three in the globular domain of the CP (D139A, R142A, and D148A) were decreased in the shutoff of BMV RNA accumulation. The three mutants did differ in other CP-associated activities. D139A was shown to decrease the ability to repress accumulation of BMV RNAs (Figs. 4b and 5 ) and the translation from the reporter construct 2GFP2. 10 R142A and D148A retained the ability to inhibit translation but increased RNA synthesis when expressed at concentrations that are expected to be inhibitory to RNA accumulation. Although R142A mutant can replicate, encapsidate, and move systematically, the virion appears to be less stable compared with the WT BMV as determined by differential scanning fluorimetry (Fig. 7b) . The D148A virion has lost the ability to move systematically, although it can replicate and form the virion. This result suggests that the C-terminus of BMV CP might control viral long-distance movement, as has been reported by Okinaka et al. 31 Since CP could bind with the host cellular protein, 32 it raises the possibility that D148A mutant could affect the ability to interact with the host factor(s), which is critical for viral trafficking. Indeed, it was recently reported that cellular proteins' Cajal body and nucleolus are required for groundnut rosette virus to move viral RNA long distances through the phloem. 33, 34 The effect of the three mutants on RNA accumulation was seen with both minus-and plusstrand RNAs (Fig. 4c) , suggesting that replication activity has been increased with these two mutations. At this point, our results suggest that R142A contributes to RNA-binding affinity without affecting the specific recognition of a regulatory RNA motif. However, a number of factors are compatible with the BMV CP having a role in RNA replication. First, mutations in the CP, such as R142A and D148A, can increase BMV RNA accumulation. Second, the CP can selectively bind the promoter for BMV minus-strand RNA synthesis. 11 Third, the R142A substitution that increased RNA accumulation increased the affinity for binding to RNA motifs.",

            "text": "The BMV RNA replication field has generally thought that the replicase does not require the CP. This is in a large part due to BMV RNA1 and RNA2 being able to replicate in the absence of BMV RNA3. 9, 35, 36 However, RNA accumulation in the absence of RNA3 is reduced by at least a log and the CP expressed in trans can rescue RNA accumulation to levels comparable with those seen with RNA3. 9 Results herein suggest that the CP should be reevaluated as an important component of BMV RNA replication in plants, as is the case with alfalfa mosaic virus replication. 2, 37 The multiple roles of the BMV CP in the infection process may take place as follows: After the three genomic RNAs enter the cell's cytoplasm, the viral RNAs can serve as templates for the translation of replication proteins 1a and 2a. Protein 1a induces invaginations at the ER membrane 38 and recruits RNA template as well as binds the 2a polymerase and/or host factor (s). [39] [40] [41] The progeny RNAs will template the translation of additional BMV proteins, including the CP. At low CP concentrations, it binds to specific RNA motifs to modulate replication. 11 At higher CP concentrations, binding to specific RNA elements could prevent translation of BMV proteins and/or replicase formation. It is also possible that the CP could bind elements in the three BMV RNAs with different affinities or different oligomerization states. There is already a suggestion that the one nucleotide difference in the B boxes of RNA2 and RNA3 affected RNA binding by the CP. 10 Lastly, we note that, despite being a positivesense RNA virus with a single-stranded RNA genome, the encapsidated viral RNA may contain a significant amount of RNAs that are base paired. 42 It is possible that the CP can serve an important role in preventing the recognition of the double-stranded RNA by the host innate immunity receptors. Clearly, additional roles for the multifunctional CP remain to be elucidated.",

Electron micrographs were digitalized using an Epson Projection 3200 scanner (Long Beach, CA) at 1200 dpi, corresponding to 5.5 \u00c5/pixel. The EMAN software package run under Linux was used for single-particle image analysis and three-dimensional reconstruction. 26 For all preparations, over 1000 particles were selected from the electron micrographs using EMAN's Boxer routine. The images were then filtered to remove high-and low-frequency noises, translationally and rotationally aligned, classified, and averaged without applying symmetry. For three-dimensional reconstruction, an initial model was produced from the centered particles with EMAN's Starticos program and subjected to eight cycles of refinement by projection matching. The final three-dimensional reconstruction was scaled to 5.5 \u00c5/pixel with EMAN's Proc3d program and visualized with the University of California, Santa Cruz, Chimera software. 25 Model for the study and schematics of key constructs. (a) A model for the interaction between the BMV CP and various RNA elements in the BMV RNAs. The 5\u2032-UTRs of BMV RNA1 and RNA2 contain a conserved motif named the B box, and the 3\u2032-UTRs contain the SLC motif. (b) Constructs used in this study. Plasmids pBR1, pBR2, and pBR3 result in the transcription of the three BMV RNAs, which are individually encapsidated into separate virions. The plasmids are engineered to have tandem copies of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (straight arrow) and a cis-acting ribozyme sequence (curved arrow) that will generate the authentic 3\u2032 end of the BMV RNAs. The locations of the RNA motifs of the B box and SLC are identified by the letters B and C in outline fonts. Plasmid pCP was used for the transient expression of BMV CP from tandem copies of the 35S promoter and a translational enhancer 5\u2032 of the BMV capsid coding sequence. The 3\u2032-untranslated sequence contains a polyA processing signal (AATAA). Reporter RNA 2GFP2 contains the GFP coding sequence flanked by the 5\u2032-UTR and 3\u2032-UTR of BMV genomic RNA2. Mapping of the RNA-binding residues in the BMV CP. (a) Schematic of the RCAP protocol used to map the CP peptide-RNA interaction. Three RNA samples were analyzed as diagrammed. (b) Representative MALDI-ToF MS spectra showing the signals obtained from a control sample and a sample of the CP cross-linked to the SLD4 RNA. Both were treated identically except that the control was not subjected to formaldehyde. Signals that are three standard errors above the background were considered to be significant. (c) Sequence of the BMV CP from residues 2-189 with the peptides identified by the three RNAs in color. The peptide cross-linked to all three RNAs is shown in red. The peptide that was cross-linked to the B box and SLD4 is shown in maroon. The N-terminal methionine was not included because it was processed from the mature capsid. 18 (d) Modeling of CP interaction with virion RNA. The region in the globular domain of the CP is emphasized since it was preferentially used to interact with SLD4 and the B box. The subunits that form the pentamer and hexamer are shown in green, blue, and yellow to allow better visualization of the subunits. The locations of several of the potential RNA-binding residues are identified by the names of the residues. The purple ribbons represent the fragments of RNAs seen in the CCMV crystal structure that are positioned onto the structure of the BMV capsid. The amino acids that could contact viral RNA are shown in the context of a hexamer of the BMV capsid. (e) A view of the residues in a monomer of the BMV CP that were subjected to mutational analysis. Effects of transient expression of mutant BMV CPs on viral RNA accumulation. (a) Overexpression of the WT and mutant CP on BMV RNA accumulation. A mixture of Agrobacterium expressing RNA1, RNA2, and RNA3 (each at an OD 595 of 0.1) was coinfiltrated with the culture that can express either WT CP (A-pCP) or mutant derivatives (each at an OD 595 of 1.0). Agrobacterium harboring the vector was used as a negative control. Viral RNA was detected by Northern blot assay. The ethidium-bromide-stained cellular RNA was used as a loading control. Quantification of RNA3 is shown at the bottom of the image as a percentage of the vector control. The standard error (SE) values represent one standard deviation from the mean of at least three independently assayed samples. (b) Effect of WT and mutant BMV CP on RNA accumulation when infiltrated at an OD 595 of 0.05. The samples were processed as described above. Characterization of the three BMV CP mutants that affected the ability to repress RNA accumulation. (a) Western blot of CP expression level in N. benthamiana plants infiltrated with Agrobacterium (OD 595 of 1.0) harboring the empty vector or pCP that can express either WT or mutant BMV CP. The entire leaf was macerated and clarified by centrifugation at 13,000g, and then an aliquot was subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto PVDF membrane. The primary antibody was rabbit anti-CP polyclonal antibody. A Coomassie bluestained small subunit of Rubisco was used as the protein loading control. The mean and standard error values of at least three independently assayed samples are shown below the gel image. (b) Titration of Agrobacterium expressing CP mutant D139A on BMV RNA accumulation. N. benthamiana plants were infiltrated with a mixture of Agrobacterium expressing three genomic RNAs (each at an OD 595 of 0.1) along with culture that can express either WT CP or the D139A mutant at the concentrations noted above the gel image. Viral RNA was detected by a Northern blot assay, and RNA3 was quantified at the bottom of the image as a percentage of the vector control. The standard error values represent one standard deviation from at least three independently assayed samples. Those dented with a dash were deemed to be below the limit of accurate detection by phosphorimage analysis. (c) Effects of titration of Agrobacterium expressing CP mutants R142A and D148A on RNA accumulation. The minus-strand (top panel) and plus-strand (middle panel) RNAs were detected by Northern blot with specific probe. The bottom panel contains ethidium-bromide-stained cellular RNA used as a loading control. Quantification of the plus-strand BMV RNAs is shown at the bottom of the gel image and is representative of two independent experiments with four independent samples. Effects of the three CP mutants on BMV RNA1 and RNA2 accumulations. N. benthamiana was agroinfiltrated to express RNA1, RNA2, and either WT or mutant CP from A-pCP or the empty expression vector (Vec.). The RNAs were identified by Northern blot analysis using probes to the 3\u2032-UTRs of the BMV RNAs. Quantifications were determined by phosphorimage analysis and were normalized for the input RNA, as estimated by the staining of cellular RNAs (cRNA). The accumulation of the minus-strand RNAs (not shown) parallels that of the plusstrand RNAs. Effects of CP mutants on reporter RNA translation. (a) Representative fluorescent microscopic examination of GFP expression from the 2GFP2 reporter in N. benthamiana leaves. Agrobacterium harboring 2GFP2 (at an OD 595 of 0.2) was co-infiltrated with the culture that can express either WT CP or the mutants (each at an OD 595 of 1.0). GFP images were taken at 40 hpi. (b) Western blot analysis of GFP and CP expression. The leaves were macerated, and approximately equal amounts of protein lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with either rabbit anti-CP polyclonal antibody or mouse anti-GFP monoclonal antibody. The secondary antibodies used were a goat anti-rabbit or a goat anti-mouse. \"Rubisco\" denotes the small subunit of the Rubisco protein that served as a protein loading control. Characterization of mutant viruses in N. benthamiana. (a) Electron micrographs of WT and mutant virions and three-dimensional reconstruction of viral particles. Viral particles were visualized at a magnification of 39,000\u00d7 with a JEOL 1200EX electron microscope at 100 kV. The micrographs were digitalized using an Epson Projection 3200 scanner at 1200 dpi, corresponding to 5.5 \u00c5/pixel.

(c) SDS-PAGE to detect the viral CP from the local inoculated leaves and systemic infection leaves. N. benthamiana leaves were infiltrated with a mixture of Agrobacterium expressing BMV RNA1 and RNA2 along with culture expressing either WT RNA3 or mutant RNA3 (R142A or D148A). The virions were separately isolated from locally inoculated and systemically infected leaves, respectively, and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. The agarose gel was used to detect the viral RNA isolated from WT virus or the mutant virion. Viral RNA was extracted and loaded on 1.2% native agarose gel. RNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Affinity of WT and the R142A CP for binding the B-box and SLC RNA motifs. (a) SDS-PAGE showing the quantity and purity of WT CP and R142A subunits purified from virions. The virion was purified from CsCl gradients and dissociated as described in Materials and Methods. (b) Affinity anisotropy experiment to determine the binding affinity of the CP to fluorescencelabeled SLD4. The RNA, at a final concentration of 0.2 \u03bcM, was in a 500-\u03bcL cuvette containing a magnetic stir bar, suspended in a buffer containing 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 50 mM NaCl. WT CP or R142A subunits were titrated into the cuvettes, and at least 10 anisotropy values were taken after each aliquot of CP was added. All data were corrected for the background intensity of the buffer. Binding data were fitted into the Hill equation using KaleidaGraph software. (c) Anisotropy experiment to determine the affinity of WT CP or mutants for the Bbox RNA. A summary of the peptides in the CP that contact the B-box motif, SLD4, or the virion RNA and a comparison with the peptides from the WT CP that were cross-linked to the same RNAs. (a) Schematics of the locations of the peptides that bind to the three RNAs used in the mapping studies. The peptides that differed between the WT and R142A capsid are highlighted in a darker shade. (b) Models of the BMV CP with the peptides cross-linked to each RNA highlighted in the same color scheme as that in (a). The location of the R142 residue is shown in red.",
