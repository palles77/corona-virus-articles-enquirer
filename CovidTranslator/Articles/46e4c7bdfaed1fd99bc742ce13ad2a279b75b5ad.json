The animals died cf acute hepatitis with high viral titres in the liver accompanied by many necrotic foci and high serum transaminase levels. Resistance to virus was re-established by refeeding HC mice with a normal diet for 2 weeks. This modification of pathogenesis was accompanied by an increase in the susceptibility, of hepatocyte cultures from HC mice to MHV3 and could be explained by an enhancement in virus adsorption. We hypothesize that the incorporation of cholesterol into the plasma membranes of hepatocytes of HC mice, thereby decreasing the membrana fluidity, may lead to an increase in the availability of virus receptors.",

Susceptibility to MHV3 infection is genetically determined (Le Pr~vost et aL, 1975a, b; Virelizier, 1980) . Accordingly, BALB/c mice, a susceptible strain, develop acute hepatitis and die after 3-4 days of infection, whereas A/J mice, a resistant strain, develop mild disease with the appearance of a small number of necrotic foci in the liver which disappear 8 to 12 days later. The degree of virus replication in different tissues varies from one strain of mouse to another (Virelizier and Allison, 1976; Arnheiter et al., 1982; Pereira et al., 1984a) .",

An increase in cholesterol, which alters the membrane cho!estero!-to-phospho!ipid molar ratio, interacts with the phospholipid membrane to form complexes and decreases the fluidity of the bilayers (Demel and de Kruyff, 1976; Shinitzky and Inbar, 1976) .

Since our data show disparities in the size and number of syncytia in MHV3-infected liver and hepatocyte cultures from NR as compared to HC mice, differences in the cellular processing of the S glycoprotein may be a possibility. Sturman et al. (1985) and Frana et al. (1985) have demonstrated that cleavage of 180-kDa S to 90-kDa species by host cell enzymes is required for stimulating the cellfusing activity of S glycoprotein, and thus determines the extent of MHV-A59-induced fusion of various cell lines. If this cleavage is more important or effective in HC cells than in control hepatocytes, the difference in the size of the syncytia observed can thereby be explained. The outcome of MHV3 infection may also be affected by the intracellular transportation of the S glycoprotein to the cell membrane which may be more rapid and effective in HC cells. The modification in membrane composition produced by the HC diet would thus render the cell membrane more sensitive to the fusing effects of S glycoprotein; a similar observation has been made by Daya et al. (1988) who noticed a dramatic increase in cell fusion after MHV infection (strain A59) of L2 and LM-K cells in which the membrane cholesterol content was increased.",
