Dogs with HOD-affected littermates were more likely to relapse, compared with the likelihood of relapse for dogs with no HOD-affected littermates. All 53 dogs had been vaccinated 1 to 30 days before HOD onset; no difference was found between the number of dogs with a history of vaccination with a recombinant vaccine (n = 21) versus a nonrecombinant vaccine (32). Fifty (94.3%) dogs had radiographic lesions compatible with HOD at disease onset, and the other 3 (5.7%) had HOD lesions 48 to 72 hours after the onset of clinical signs. Twelve of 22 (54.5%) dogs treated with NSAIDs did not achieve remission by 7 days after initiation of treatment. All dogs treated initially with corticosteroids achieved remission within 8 to 48 hours. Of the 33 dogs that reached adulthood, 28 (84.8%) were healthy and 5 (15.2%) had episodes of pyrexia and malaise.",

            "text": "Hypertrophic osteodystrophy, which was first reported in the 1930s, is a developmental systemic disease of rapidly growing young dogs. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Clinical manifestation of HOD ranges from mild, self-limiting disease 4, 14, 15 to severe multisystemic life-threatening illness. 5, 9, 13, 16 Clinical signs include recurrent episodes of pyrexia and malaise, often accompanied by signs of pain and soft tissue swelling over a metaphyseal region. Affected dogs have variable degrees of lameness, from a mild limp to full recumbency. Additional clinical signs that may precede the onset of ostealgia include ocular and nasal discharge, skin pustules or nodules, diarrhea, hematochezia, vulvovaginitis, and pathological respiratory sounds. 1, 4, 7, 17 Age of onset ranges between 7 weeks 6 and 8 months, 18 and the highest incidence is reported for dogs between 3 and 4 months of age. 16 Relapse is common and may occur until closure of the physes. 7 Nonspecific hematologic findings include leukocytosis characterized by neutrophilia and monocytosis as well as mild nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytosis, or thrombocytopenia. 9, 10, 12 Serum biochemical analysis may reveal hyperphosphatemia and an elevated alkaline phosphatase activity, which is characteristic of juvenile animals, 19, 20 together with nonspecific findings such as hypoalbuminemia and low BUN and creatinine concentrations. 9, 10, 12 Diagnosis of HOD is made on the basis of the medical history, clinical signs, and signalment and by ruling out infectious causes. Radiography and histologic evaluation of bone sections reveal characteristic lesions 2, 4, 5, 18 in the metaphysis of the long bones, but lesions in the vertebrae, ribs, and mandible 6 as well as the scapulae, humeri, and femurs 12, 21 and the optic foraminae 2 have also been reported. Radiographic changes include metaphyseal sclerosis, widening of the metaphyseal region, and appearance of transverse radiolucent lines in the metaphysis with or without paracortical mineralization and periosteal proliferation. 1, 7, 14 Dogs with severe HOD may develop secondary angular limb deformities. 1, 7 Histologically, necrotic trabeculae and infiltrations of polymorphonuclear cells are evident in the affected metaphyses and are accompanied by hemorrhage, hemosiderin deposits, and fibrosis. 1, 2, 7, 13 Despite extensive clinical characterization of HOD, the pathogenesis remains unknown. Suggested causes, such as vitamin C deficiency 6 and excess dietary supplementation with vitamins and minerals, 22 have been excluded on the basis of results of controlled studies. 3 Infection with canine distemper virus has also been considered as a cause of HOD [22] [23] [24] [25] ; however, an attempt to transmit HOD from affected to nonaffected dogs failed, and experimental canine distemper virus infection did not cause HOD lesions in the infected dogs. 3 In 1 study, 17 investigators found Escherichia coli bacteremia in a single HODaffected dog, but they speculated that the infection was a secondary condition and not the cause of HOD.",

Other authors have hypothesized that HOD is a vaccine-induced condition in Weimaraners. 10 Given that HOD and the age at the time of vaccination in puppies coincide (and that most of the vaccinated Weimaraners do not develop HOD), it is impossible to rule in or out the contribution of vaccination to the onset of HOD without performing additional controlled studies that include unvaccinated dogs. Other authors have proposed that a recombinant vaccine should be evaluated as an alternative to conventional vaccines for use in Weimaraner puppies. 10 In the present study, approximately 40% of the dogs were vaccinated with a recombinant vaccine. a Although no titers were available to assess the protective effect of the recombinant vaccine in comparison to the nonrecombinant polyvalent vaccines, analysis of the data suggested that in dogs genetically predisposed to HOD, recombinant vaccines did not eliminate development of the disease. Similar to results reported elsewhere, 5, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] abnormal CBC and biochemical values in the present study were nonspecific or, in the case of hyperphosphatemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase activity, are routinely detected in juvenile animals. 19, 20 The underlying mechanism for HOD is unknown, and the complex manifestation of the disease, including variation in the presence and severity of the clinical signs, suggests a multifactorial cause, such as that observed for immune-mediated disorders. 13 Further support for an immune mechanism in which an immature immune system is mounting a severe sterile inflammatory reaction is the strong positive response to immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids. 9, 10, 27 Additional studies targeting the involvement of the immune system in the course of HOD in Weimaraners are required to confirm this hypothesis. Current recommended treatments for HOD are nonspecific and are intended to alleviate the clinical signs of pyrexia, ostealgia, and malaise. Treatment with NSAIDs or corticosteroids together with supportive care are considered appropriate. 7, 8, 11, 15, 16 However, in the present study, 12 of 22 (54.5%) dogs failed to respond to treatment with NSAIDs and had to be switched to treatment with corticosteroids, which suggested that the immune suppressive action of corticosteroids was required to achieve remission. 27 Three dogs with HOD that had clinical signs of pyrexia and malaise did not have radiographic lesions at the time of initial evaluation but had typical lesions on a second set of radiographs obtained 48 to 72 hours later. The reason for the delayed radiographic lesions is unclear, and a hypothesis that the general illness may precede detectable bone lesions in extremely young animals was ruled out because the 3 dogs with delayed lesions belonged to 3 age categories. Therefore, repeated radiographs at a 72-hour interval from the onset of clinical signs may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of HOD.",
