Physical examination, neurologic examination and blood chemistry results were unremarkable at that time. Two days later, on 31 May 2018 (day 0), the cat had a generalized tonic-clonic seizure at home and was started on levetiracetam (Keppra; Lupin) (37 mg/kg PO q8h; Keppra).",

A diagnostic work-up for feline seizures was performed on day 1, including a complete blood count, chemistry and electrolyte panel, urinalysis that showed normal red and white blood cell counts, platelet count, electrolyte and acid-base balance, and liver and kidney function. Infectious disease testing submitted on day 1 included feline leukemia virus and Cryptococcus antigen testing, and feline immunodeficiency virus, coronavirus, Toxoplasma gondii and Bartonella henselae serologic testing through a commercial laboratory (Antech New York laboratory) and were negative. Preprandial and postprandial bile acid testing was also performed on day 1 through the same laboratory (Antech New York laboratory) and were unremarkable (preprandial 7.1 \u00b5mol/l [<13 \u00b5mol/l], postprandial 6.5 \u00b5mol/l [<30 \u00b5mol/l]). In addition to the levetiracetam, the cat was prescribed phenobarbital (1.6 mg/kg PO q12h) and empirically treated with doxycycline (10 mg/kg PO q12h) and clindamycin (25 mg/kg PO q12h).",

The cat's hyporexia persisted, and the cat was evaluated by its veterinarian on 8 June 2018 (day 8) for persistent hyporexia despite stopping antibiotics, at which point a temperature of 105 o F was documented. No changes in the cat's physical or neurologic examination were noted, and the cat's chief complaint was hyporexia. Laboratory work performed on day 8 included a complete blood count and chemistry panel that revealed a leukocytosis of 24,050 cells/\u00b5l (5500-19,500 cells/\u00b5l) characterized by a mature neutrophilia of 18,570 cells/\u00b5l (2500-14,000 cells/\u00b5l), a mild thrombocytopenia of 158,000 cells/\u00b5l and a mild hypophosphatemia of 2.8 mg/dl (3.4-8.5 mg/dl). It was then prescribed amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (Clavamox; Zoetis) (12.5 mg/kg PO q12h \u00d7 7) and marbofloxacin (Zeniquin; Zoetis) (5 mg/kg PO). The increased temperature did not resolve with intravenous fluids and the oral antibiotics overnight, and the cat was transferred to an emergency care facility for further treatment (day 9).",

The cat then underwent an MRI of the brain (1.5 Tesla magnet; GE Signa Legacy), which showed equivocal/mild contrast enhancement of the meninges with no overt evidence for structural or inflammatory disease. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a lack of pleocytosis (total nucleated cell count of 1 cell/\u00b5l) and no albuminocytologic dissociation (10 mg/dl protein).

The cat's fever was not documented until 3 days after discontinuing the doxycycline and clindamycin on day 1 and persisted after again discontinuing the same medications on day 11. The lack of response to initial antimicrobial therapy and inpatient supportive care from days 9 to 11 in the light of the patient's initially normal diagnostic work-up raised concern for an idiosyncratic drug reaction.

Other possible differentials for the cat's transient fever and hyporexia, such as an upper respiratory infection, were considered less likely given the clear upper airway and oral cavity and normal thoracic auscultation.

Onset of signs typically occurs 2-6 weeks after starting the causative drug. Similar reports of anticonvulsant-related syndromes have been reported in dogs and cats, as well as other hematologic and biochemical abnormalities.

The cat underwent a complete diagnostic work-up for fever of unknown origin, which revealed no underlying cause, and the temporal relationship between starting and discontinuing phenobarbital and onset and resolution of fever is consistent with reports in human beings of drug-induced fever. While we do not know whether the cat's clinical signs would have progressed in severity to include hematologic abnormalities, generalized lymphadenopathy and/or cutaneous lesions if the phenobarbital were not discontinued in a timely fashion, the lack of such findings at multiple timepoints over several days during the cat's work-up for fever of unknown origin suggests that the cat's syndrome was limited to a fever.
