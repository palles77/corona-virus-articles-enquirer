Ruminants have been useful research subjects for reproductive research such as embryo transfer, artificial insemination (AI), and control of the reproductive cycle (Wall et al., 1997) . Several important milestones in gene transfer, cloning, and genetic engineering techniques have been developed or demonstrated using these species (Cibelli et al., 1998a, b) . One of many proposed uses of genetically engineered ruminants is the production of proteins to be secreted in the milk and later isolated. Healthy sheep and goats are also often used for antibody production.",

These species have a threecompartment forestomach (rumen, reticulum, and omasum) and a true stomach (abomasum). The mature rumen functions as an anaerobic fermentation chamber in which the enzymes, such as cellulase, of the resident bacteria (10 9 -10 10 /ml), allow the animal to prosper as an herbivore. Digestion is also aided by other microorganisms, such as protozoa (10 5 -10 6 /ml) and fungi, which contribute to the rumen ecosystem. The result is the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA: acetic, propionic, and butyric). Unlike the monogastrics, fermentative digestion and VFA absorption also occur in the large intestines. These VFA serve as the main sources of energy for ruminants rather than glucose. Glucose is formed from propionic acid (or from amino acids) for metabolism in the central nervous system, uterus, and mammary gland. Plasma glucose is much lower and regulated differently in ruminants than in nonruminants. Rumen microorganisms also synthesize B-complex vitamins and vitamin K, and provide protein utilized by the animals' systems. Large amounts of fermentation gases such as carbon dioxide and methane are naturally eructated (Jurgens et al., 2013; Reece 2004) . Sheep and goats have tidy 'pelleted' dark-green feces.

Ruminants generally have fewer neutrophils than lymphocytes.

Because of the large volume of rumen water, adult ruminants can generally go several days without drinking before significant dehydration occurs. Erythrocytes may become more fragile during rehydration, resulting in some degree of hemolysis and hemoglobinuria. However, severe dehydration can occur quickly in animals that are ill, particularly in pre-ruminant neonates. Urine pH is generally alkaline in adult ruminants.",

If needed, pelleted concentrates are preferred because the goat will pick out large particles in mixes. When given access to a salt block, ruminants will generally self-regulate intake.

Colostrum contains concentrated maternal antibodies (mostly as IgG1), functional leukocytes, and cytokines. The quality of the colostrum is affected by vaccination programs and the dam's overall condition and nutrition throughout gestation and at the time of parturition. Ensuring effective passive immune transfer primarily is dependent on the timing and volume of colostrum ingested by the neonate. Reliance on suckling in dairy calves has been associated with failure of passive immune transfer (NAHMS Dairy Studies, 2007) . Frozen or 'banked' colostrum may be used for animals whose dams have poor quality or inadequate volume of colostrum. Colostrum immunoglobulin content can be estimated by specific gravity, by a Brix refractometer, or by commercial test kits designed for on-farm use (Brujeni et al., 2010) . Commercial colostrum replacers or supplements also are available. A Holstein calf should receive its first 2-l meal of colostrum within 4 h of birth and should consume at least 100 g of IgG within the first 24 h of life. In general, this IgG requirement can be met with 4 l of good-quality colostrum. After 2-3 days, dairy calves are fed milk replacer or whole milk.

Teaser animals outfitted with marking devices are also used. Other methods of detecting estrus include monitoring blood progesterone levels, change in conductivity of cervical mucus, change in vaginal pH and body temperature, and evaluating activity levels by the use of pedometry (Hafez and Hafez, 2000) .",

Placentation in sheep, goats, and cattle is epitheliochorial and cotyledonary.

Chorioretinitis and conjunctivitis are also common signs in cattle and sheep; lameness, skin lesions such as drying and cracking of the nose and mammary gland, and alopecia are also observed. Secondary bacterial pneumonia may occur, and animals may develop severe diarrhea. Sudden deaths may occur due to cardiomyopathy at any time during the disease.

The respiratory form is known as IBR or 'red nose.' Clinical signs may range from mild to severe with severity associated with the presence of additional respiratory viral infections or secondary bacterial infections. The mortality rate in more mature cattle is low, however, unless there is secondary bacterial pneumonia. Fever, anorexia, restlessness, hyperemia of the muzzle and nares, gray pustules on the muzzle (that later form plaques), nasal discharge progressing from serous to mucopurulent, hyperpnea, coughing, salivation, conjunctivitis with excessive epiphora, and decreased production in dairy animals are typical signs. Recovery generally occurs 4-5 days after the onset of clinical signs as long as there is no complication with bacterial pneumonia. Neonatal calves may develop respiratory as well as general systemic disease. Young calves are most susceptible to the encephalitic form; signs include dull attitude, head pressing, vocalizations, nystagmus, head tilt, blindness, convulsions, and coma. This form is usually fatal within 5 days. Abortion may occur simultaneously with as a sequel to the conjunctival or respiratory tract diseases regardless of the severity of the disease in the dam. Abortions are usually seen in the second half of pregnancy, but early embryonic death is possible. Infectious pustular vulvovaginitis (IPV) is most commonly seen in dairy cows; signs include fever, depression, anorexia, vulvar labia swelling, vulvar discharge, and reddened vaginal mucosa due to pustule development. If uncomplicated, the infection lasts about 4-5 days, and lesions heal in 2 weeks.

The major helminths may result in gastroenteritis associated with intestinal hemorrhage and malnutrition. The disease is associated with grazing exposure to infective larvae. Animals procured for research may have had exposure to these helminths. Mixed infections of these parasites are common. Generally, older animals develop resistance to some of the species; thus, animals between about 2 months and 2 years of age are most susceptible to infection. Because of the parasites' effects on the animals' physiology, infection in these younger animals is a major contributor to a cycle of poor nutrition and digestion, compromised immune responses, and impaired growth and development. Diagnosis is primarily based on fecal flotation techniques; however, because many of these nematodes have similarly appearing ova, hatching the ova and identifying the larvae is often required (Baermann technique). The pre-patent period for most nematode parasites is 2-3 weeks. A number of anthelmintics can be used to interrupt nematode life-cycles. (See McKellar and /or Sargison, 2012; Quinton et al., 2004 , for comprehensive reviews of treatment and control of nematodiasis.) Those nematodes with the highest potential for pathogenicity in sheep and goats include Haemonchus contortus (Barber-pole worm), Teladorsagia (formerly Ostertagia) circumcincta (Medium stomach worm), Cooperia (Small intestinal worms), Trichostrongylus spp. (Hair worms), Oesophagostomum columbianum (Nodule worm disease, pimply gut), Cooperia curticei, and Strongyloides pappilosus. In cattle, clinical parasitism is often associated with Haemonchus placei, Ostertagia LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE ostertagi, Trichostrongylus axei, Cooperia spp., Strongyloides spp., and Oesophagostomum spp. Trichostrongyles such as Ostertagia, Haemonchus, Trichostrongylus, Cooperia, Dictyocaulus, and Oesophagostomum may undergo seasonal hypobiosis or arrested development of the lifecycle. In the northern hemisphere larvae arrest and accumulate inside grazing animals in the fall, allowing the parasite to overwinter in the animal protected from winter pasture conditions. Rotation of anthelmintics due to inherent resistance development and appropriate pasture management are key principles in parasite control.",

In the continental U.S., Fasciola hepatica infections are primarily seen in southeastern and western states. Fascioloides magna infections are typically seen in the Texas; Gulf coast; Great Lakes; and northwestern states where ruminants share pasture with deer, elk, and moose. Dicrocoelium dendriticum infections occur primarily in the eastern U.S. and Atlantic provinces of Canada, however Dicrocelium also occurs in areas of Europe and Asia. Liver fluke eggs are passed in the bile and feces and hatch in 2-3 weeks to form the free-swimming miracidia. It is important to note that each fluke egg represents the source of eventually thousands of cercariae or metacercariae. The miracidia penetrate the body of an intermediate host (usually freshwater snails) and develop through sporocysts and rediae stages, finally forming cercariae. The cercariae leave the intermediate host, swim to grassy vegetation, and become cyst-like metacercariae, which may remain in a dormant stage on the grass for 6 months or longer until ingested by a ruminant. The ingested metacercariae penetrate the small-intestinal wall, migrate through the abdominal cavity to the liver where they locate in a bile duct, mature and remain for up to 4 years.",

F. magna infections in sheep and goats can be fatal as the result of just one fluke tunneling through hepatic tissue. In cattle, infections are often asymptomatic due to the host's encapsulation of the parasite. Liver fluke damage may predispose to invasion by anaerobic Clostridium species such as C. novyi that could lead to fatal Black Disease or bacillary hemoglobinuria. Chronic disease may result from fluke-induced physical damage to the bile ducts and cholangiohepatitis. Blood loss into the bile may lead to anemia and hypoproteinemia. Liver damage also is evidenced by increases in liver enzymes such as gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT). Persistent eosinophilia is also seen with liver fluke disease. Other clinical signs of liver fluke disease include anorexia, weight loss, unthriftiness, edema, and ascites. At necropsy, livers will be pale, friable and may have distinct migration tunnels along the serosal surfaces. Bile ducts will be enlarged and areas of fibrosis will be evident.",

The condition most frequently occurs in animals that recently have been fed abundant quantities of succulent forages or grains. Bloat is classified into two broad categories: frothy bloat and free-gas bloat. Frothy bloat is associated with ingestion of feeds that produce a stable froth that is not easily expelled from the rumen. Fermentation gases such as CO 2 and methane incorporate into the froth and over-distend the rumen, eventually compromising respiration by limiting diaphragm movement. Typical feedstuffs that cause frothy bloat include fresh or dried legumes (alfalfa or clover) or cereal grains (especially finely ground corn and barley). Free-gas bloat is more often related to rumen atony or physical/pathological problems preventing normal gas eructation. Some causes of free-gas bloat include esophageal obstructions (foreign bodies such as boluses, apples, etc.), positional (e.g., being trapped in a position that precludes eructation), tumors, abscesses, enlarged cervical or thoracic lymph nodes, vagal nerve paralysis or injury, traumatic reticulitis, hypocalcemia, and central nervous system conditions affecting eructation reflexes.",

Passage of a stomach tube helps to differentiate between free-gas bloat and frothy bloat. Obstructions may require manual removal prior to the use of a stomach tube; be sure to consider rabies prior to manual extraction. With freegas bloat, expulsion of gas through the stomach tube aids in treatment of the disorder. Once rumen distension is alleviated with free-gas bloat, the underlying cause must be investigated to prevent reoccurrence. Frothy bloat is more difficult to treat as the foam blocks the stomach tube. Addition of mineral oil, surfactants or antifermentative compounds via stomach tube may help break down surface tension, allowing gas to be expelled. In acute, life-threatening cases of bloat, treatment should be aimed at alleviating rumen distension by placing a trocar or surgical rumenotomy into the rumen via the left paralumbar fossa. Feeding management is critical in controlling the incidence of bloat; limiting the consumption of feedstuffs known to induce bloat can prevent the disease. In addition, feeding poloxalene will decrease the incidence of legume bloat. Ionophores such as monensin or lasalocid can reduce the incidence of frothy bloat from either legume or concentrate feeds (Streeter, 2009) .",

Acute metabolic disease usually is caused by sudden engorgement on grains or other highly fermentable carbohydrate sources or by a rapid change from a diet containing high roughage content to one containing a relatively high proportion of grain. Common cereal grains and feedstuffs such as sugar beets, molasses, and potatoes predispose to acidosis. Ingestion of large amounts of these carbohydrate-rich feeds causes proliferation of gram-positive bacteria leading to rapid fermentation with an increase in lactic acid production and reduction of rumen pH.

Early signs in ewes include stiffness and incoordination of movements, especially in the hind limbs. Later, muscular tremors, muscular weakness, and recumbency will ensue. Morbidity may approach 30% while mortality may reach as high as 90% in untreated animals. Affected does become bloated, weak, unsteady and eventually recumbent. Cows typically are affected within 24-48 h before or after parturition. Cows initially are weak and show evidence of muscle tremors, then deteriorate to sternal recumbency, with head usually tucked to the abdomen, and an inability to stand. Muscle weakness predisposes to traumatic injuries such as splayleg or hip fractures. Tachycardia, dilated pupils, anorexia, hypothermia, depression, ruminal stasis, bloat, uterine inertia, and loss of anal tone are also seen at this stage. The terminal stage of disease is a rapid progression from coma to death. Heart rates will be high but pulse may not be detectable.",

Dairy cows which have been recumbent for more than 12 h may have severe muscle damage due to 'crush syndrome.' LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE Prevention and Control In sheep, maintaining appropriate body condition during the last trimester is helpful in preventing the disease. Recent information suggests that dry cow diets which rely on legume and grass forages, which are relatively high in potassium, create a slight physiological alkalosis that decreases tissue responsiveness to parathyroid hormone (Goff, 2009) . Limiting sodium and potassium in the diet of prepartum cows to levels that will just meet maintenance requirements is critical. In herds with a high incidence or genetic predisposition to hypocalcemia, such as Jersey cows, increasing dietary chlorides is often helpful. Oral calcium supplements (gels or boluses) given to multiparous cows at the time of calving can be effective in preventing hypocalcemia.",

Negative energy balance is a result of lower intake in conjunction with increasing nutrient demands of the growing fetus and colostrogenesis. In addition, dairy cows typically mobilize body adipose stores to support the energy demands of milk production for the first 7-8 weeks of lactation. When adipose reserves are mobilized, ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetate, and betahydroxybutyrate) are produced in the liver. Although ketones are utilized by many body tissues as a source of energy, excessive levels in blood lead to ketonemia and ketoacidosis. In addition, mobilization of stored triglycerides in adipose results in increased blood nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs). A disproportionate amount of NEFA is extracted by the liver, resulting in an accumulation of liver triglycerides which can exceed 20% of tissue dry weight.",

Cattle feed and mineral blocks contain higher quantities of copper than are required for sheep. Chronic ingestion of these feedstuffs leads to copper accumulation and toxicity. Copper toxicosis has been reported in calves given regular oral or parenteral copper supplements, and in adult dairy cattle given copper supplements to compensate for copper deficient pasture.

Photosensitive chemicals are usually ingested but in some cases exposure may be by contact. Animals with a lack of pigment are more susceptible to the disease. Three types of photosensitization occur: primary, secondary or hepatogenous, and aberrant. Primary photosensitization is related to plant pigments or drugs such as phenothiazine, sulfonamides, or tetracyclines. Secondary photosensitization is more common in large animals, and is specifically related to the plant pigment phylloerythrin. Phylloerythrin, a porphyrin compound, is a degradation product of chlorophyll released by rumen microbial digestion. Liver disease or injury, which prevents normal conjugation of phylloerythrin and excretion through the biliary system, predisposes to photosensitization. The only example of aberrant photosensitization is congenital porphyria of cattle (see Section III, B, 1).",

Lesions are most likely to occur on white-haired or thinly haired areas. Initially, edema of the lips, corneas, eyelids, nasal planum, face, vulva, or coronary bands occurs. Facial edema, nostril constriction, and swollen lips potentially lead to difficulty breathing. With secondary photosensitization, icterus is also common. Necrosis and gangrene may occur.
