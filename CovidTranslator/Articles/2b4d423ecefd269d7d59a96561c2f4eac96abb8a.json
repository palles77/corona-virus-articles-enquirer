The presence of Mig in the supernatants of infected astrocytes was quantified using a specific ELISA. Secreted Mig was biologically active, inducing chemoattraction of mouse activated CD4 + T lymphocytes. Conversely, attracting activity on CD3 + resting T cells that can be attributed to chemokines as CXCL12/SDF-1\u03b1 could not be demonstrated in these supernatants. No overinduction of the gene coding for this chemokine was assessed by DNA hybridization either. Both recombinant IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 inflammatory cytokines were also strong inducers of Mig in SJL/J astrocyte cultures.",

During this process, cellular factors induce the recruitment of circulating immune cells into the central nervous system. These cells upregulate their expression of immunological signals, recruiting additional cells. This feedback expression of low levels of these immune molecules over long periods of time promotes various pathological effects, including demyelination. Main cytokines regulating inflammatory response include (1) interleukins that are responsible for communication between lymphocytes, (2) chemokines that promote chemotaxis, and (3) interferons with an anti-viral effect. During the past years, we have studied the overinduction of those immune mediators in the majority of the glial cell population, the astrocytes, as a consequence of its infection by the demyelinating Theiler's virus.",

The results of four recombinant inflammatory cytokines on the induction of Mig in astrocytes were summarized in Table 3 . TNF-\u03b1 (100 pg/mL) and IFN-\u03b3 (430 pg/mL) induced a statistically significant secretion of the chemokine into the culture supernatants (P < 0.01). IFN-\u03b3 is the stronger inducer as the name of the chemokine suggested (Mig: monokine induced by gamma interferon). Conversely, exposure to the interleukins IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6 did not trigger any upregulation of the Mig molecule. In Table 3 , we have summarized our previous results on this field (Rubio and Sanz-Rodriguez 2007; Rubio et al. 2014 ). TNF-\u03b1 is shown to be the best inducer (4 chemokines) followed by IL-1\u03b1 (3) and IFN-\u03b3 (2). IL-6 does not induce any chemokine in astrocyte cultures. The induction of Mig by IFN-\u03b3 is 4 and 3 times stronger (430 pg/mL) than TMEV infection (100 pg/ mL at a m.o.i of 100).",

The first one, to which CXCL12/SDF-1\u03b1 belongs, regulates the migration of naive T lymphocytes to secondary lymphoid tissues for activation (Kim and Broxmeyer 1999) . The second one, comprising the chemokines CXCL10/IP10 and CXCL9/Mig, induces the trafficking of activated antigen-specific T cells to virus-infected inflammation sites (Dufour et al. 2002) . The members of this second subfamily are critical for the control of infections, including corneal or genital herpes simplex virus infections (Thapa et al. 2008; Wuest et al. 2006) , as well as for T cell-mediated suppression of cutaneous tumors (Gorbachev et al. 2007 ). Members of this family also contribute to the protective T cell response of the CNS against mouse hepatitis virus infection in C57BL/mice (Liu et al. 2001) . In a situation of strong neuroinflammation, as our experimental model of TMEV-produced MS-like syndrome in mice, a clear role for chemokines inducing the recruitment of specific CD4 + T cells to sites of inflammation inside the CNS should be expected. In the present study, we experimentally show that chemokines of this class (Mig) are synthesized by TMEV-infected astrocyte in culture.",
