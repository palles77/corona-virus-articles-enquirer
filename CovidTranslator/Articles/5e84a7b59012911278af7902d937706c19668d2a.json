In the current study, a virulent strain of DTMUV, designated Du/CH/LSD/110128, was isolated from the livers of diseased ducks and attenuated by serial passage in embryonated chicken eggs. The virus was partially attenuated after 50 and 70 passages and was fully attenuated after 90 passages, based on mortality and morbidity rates and viral loads in inoculated ducklings. Fourteen amino acid substitutions were observed in the capsid, prM, envelope, NS1, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 proteins of the fully attenuated strain of Du/CH/LSD/110128, which might be responsible for the observed changes in replication and pathogenicity. A 72-nucleotide deletion was also observed in the 3= untranslated region of the virus after 30 passages. The fully attenuated virus retained the immunogenicity of the parental strain, providing effective protection to challenge with virulent Du/CH/LSD/110128, and may represent a suitable candidate as a vaccine strain against DTMUV infection in ducks. Our results also lay the foundation for future studies on the replication and pathogenic mechanisms of DTMUV.",

In addition to ducks, the disease has affected geese, chickens, and sparrows (1) (2) (3) . The infected ducks developed high fever, diarrhea, and anorexia and displayed retarded growth (4) . Hyperemia, hemorrhage, degeneration, distortion, and lymphocytic infiltration in the ovaries were the primary pathological features consistently observed in diseased ducks. The disease also caused large decreases in egg production in egg-laying ducks within 1 to 2 weeks postinfection. Based on the clinical signs and pathological features, the disease was designated duck hemorrhagic ovaritis (DHO) (5) . The disease is currently circulating in domestic duck flocks in China, and the epidemiology of DHO indicates no seasonality. In addition to the rapid spread among duck populations, DHO might have the potential to infect humans (6, 7) , highlighting the need to protect public health.",

Lacking a 3= polyadenylation sequence, the 3= terminus of the genome consists of a conserved CU dinucleotide. The genome contains one large open reading frame (ORF), within which several genes are arranged in the following order: 5= untranslated region (UTR), capsid, prM, envelope (E), nonstructural (NS) genes NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5, and 3= UTR (9) . Analysis of partial sequences of the E and NS5 genes revealed a close relationship with the Ntaya virus (NTAV) group of the genus Flavivirus. The phylogenetic and antigenic analyses revealed a close relationship to the Tembusu virus and the Sitiawan virus, both of which are members of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae (8, 10) .

Severe ovarian hemorrhage, ovaritis, and enlarged spleen were consistently observed in the ducks at necropsy. Ruptured ovarian follicles and peritonitis were also observed in some of the affected ducks. For viral isolation, the liver samples were prepared as 10% (wt/vol) tissue suspensions in 0.1% phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), clarified by centrifugation at 1,500 \u03eb g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, and filtered through 0.22-m membrane filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) before inoculation into the allantoic cavity of 9-to 11-day-old embryonated duck eggs, and the infectious allantoic fluid was collected 72 h postinoculation (15) . The DTMUV strain was identified by reverse transcription (RT) and PCR targeting a region in the prM gene (250-nt), using the forward and reverse primers 5=-AGACTGC TGGTGCAATGAGAC-3= and 5=-CGTCGTTCCCAGATTCCA-3=, respectively. Viral RNA was extracted from 200 l of Du/CH/LSD/110128 infectious allantoic fluid using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA fragment from viral RNA was amplified and directly sequenced by using the forward and reverse primers. The sequences were used for a BLAST search of the GenBank database, which revealed 98.8% nucleotide similarity with the BYDV (GenBank accession no. JQ920420), suggesting that the newly isolated Du/CH/LSD/110128 strain was a DTMUV. The duck embryopropagated viral stock of Du/CH/LSD/110128 was produced by inoculating the virus into embryonated eggs via the allantoic cavity and collecting the infectious allantoic fluid 72 h postinoculation, as described previously (15) , and was stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C.",

The embryos were observed at 7 days postinoculation for clinical signs of Du/CH/LSD/ 110128 infection. The chicken embryo-propagated viral stocks of Du/CH/ LSD/110128 at passage 30 (P30), P45, P60, P75, and P90 were produced by inoculating the virus into embryonated eggs via the allantoic cavity and collecting the infectious allantoic fluid 72 h postinoculation, as described previously (15) . The viral preparations were identified by the aforementioned RT-PCR assay and sequencing and were stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C as viral stocks.",

Each of the RT-PCRs of the viruses isolated from the P0, P30, P50, P70, and P90 inocula produced a single band of the expected size. Changes in the Du/CH/LSD/110128 genomic sequence that occurred during the 90 serial passages are summarized in Table 4 . No sequence changes occurred in NS2B. Two to four silent mutations occurred in the coding regions of the E, NS1, NS2A, NS3, NS4B, and NS5 genes. Most of the nucleotide substitutions in the NS1 and NS3 genes were observed at P30 and thereafter, and all of them resulted in amino acid substitutions. Singlenucleotide substitutions were also observed in the NS3 and NS4 genes at P70 and P90, respectively. One-and two-nucleotide mutations were observed in the 5= and 3= UTRs, respectively, at P30. Single-nucleotide substitutions were observed in the capsid and prM genes at P70. However, these two mutations were observed to have undergone reversion at P90. Single-nucleotide substitutions observed in the NS5 and E genes at P30 and P50, respectively, also underwent reversion during subsequent passages. None of the other aforementioned point mutations underwent reversion. At P30, a 72-nt deletion in the 3= UTR occurred 5 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon (Fig. 3) , which remained unaffected in subsequent passages.",

Based on these results, we concluded that the Du/CH/LSD/110128 strain of DTMUV was highly pathogenic in ducklings. In addition, almost all of the dead ducklings inoculated with virulent Du/CH/LSD/110128 developed splenomegaly, and the ducklings infected with parental virus and all passaged viruses had higher viral loads in the spleen than in other tissues. These results indicated that splenomegaly was an important pathological feature in the infected ducklings, and they suggested that cells of the spleen were optimal host cells for virus replication.",

The viral loads in almost all of the tissues in the P90-inoculated ducklings were lower than those in the ducklings inoculated with virulent Du/CH/LSD/110128, the P50 inoculum, or the P70 inoculum. Therefore, we concluded that the P90 virus was fully attenuated and produced no pathology in the ducklings. In addition, the viral loads in the spleens of birds infected with the P90 inoculum on day 28 postinoculation were slightly higher than those in birds that received the P70 inoculum. In the earlier report, researchers found that the attenuated variant of Japanese encephalitis virus changed the organ tropism, in comparison with the virulent virus (21) . The Du/CH/LSD/110128 strain might have changed tissue tropism during serial passage in chicken embryos, although the exact mechanism needs to be investigated further. Similar results showing that viral loads in the brains of ducklings that received the P90 inoculum were higher than those in birds infected with the P70 inoculum at days 3 and 21 postinoculation were also found, but virus was not detectable in the brains of the birds at day 28 postinoculation. Seroconversion was first observed in P90-inoculated ducklings on day 5 postinoculation, and more than 50% of the ducklings displayed seroconversion on day 10. Furthermore, P90 vaccination provided complete clinical protection against challenge with virulent Du/CH/LSD/110128, which indicated that P90 retained a level of immunogenicity suitable for a DTMUV vaccine candidate.",

Thus, it is possible that the NS3 protein functions in DTMUV replication. In addition, mutation of Leu to Phe occurred at position 6 in the NS4A protein between P70 and P90, and the pathogenicity of the P90 virus was decreased significantly, compared with that of the P70 inoculum. These results suggested that residue 6 in NS4A might be important for Du/CH/LSD/110128 virulence. This finding is consistent with that of a previous study, which showed that mutations in the N terminus (residue 3) of the NS4A protein of the Japanese encephalitis virus (another flavivirus) altered pathogenicity in mice (24) .",

Nonetheless, our findings are limited by the predictive nature of our estimation of the contributions of the various mutations observed in the P90 virus with regard to the attenuation of the Du/CH/LSD/110128 strain of DTMUV. Future reverse-genetics studies in animals are warranted to elucidate the contributions of the mutated residues to DTMUV pathogenicity. In addition, other aspects need to be investigated in future studies. First, although intracranial inoculation was used in the present study, other vaccination methods are required to evaluate the vaccine candidate. Second, although vaccination with the P90 virus provided effective protection against the Du/CH/LSD/110128 parental strain, practical investigations of the P90 virus are required to determine whether it might be a suitable candidate for commercial production of an attenuated vaccine strain against DTMUVs, such as studies of the effects of the candidate vaccine on the production performance of egg-laying ducks and the possibility of vertical transmission of the vaccine via eggs. Third, since flaviviruses persist as a mixture of quasispecies, the persistence of wild-type or more-virulent quasispecies in the vaccine strain should also be investigated in future studies. Lastly, experiments related to the ability of the attenuated virus to grow in and to be transmitted by mosquitoes are of importance because most flaviviruses are mosquito or tick borne.",
