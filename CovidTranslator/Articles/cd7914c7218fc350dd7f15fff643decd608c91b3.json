            "text": "Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is an uncommon disorder that is usually benign and self-limiting. A variety of causes of pneumomediastinum have been described including mediastinal, pulmonary, chest wall, and even retroperitoneal pathologies resulting from trauma, infection, connective tissue disorder, assisted ventilation, and trivial routine life activity such as vigorous coughing, vomiting, or deep respiratory efforts. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Recently, researchers have reported that spontaneous pneumomediastinum occurred in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 15, 16 Spontaneous pneumomediastinum has been reported to be a rare complication of various types of interstitial lung disease, including idiopathic interstitial pneumonia 1-3 and connective tissue disorder. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] However, previous series and case reports of pneumomediastinum associated with interstitial lung disease focused on precipitating factors, clinical presentation, and pathogenesis. To our knowledge, only one report has assessed computed tomography (CT) findings of lung parenchymal abnormalities in interstitial lung disease at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum. 2 The mechanism in which the pneumomediastinum arises in interstitial lung disease has not been clarified. The pathophysiology of pneumomediastinum was initially described by Macklin and Macklin 17 based on animal experiments. Pneumomediastinum could result from the rupture of distal pulmonary alveoli due to the rapid increase in intra-alveolar pressure in the alveoli, allowing air bubbles to travel along the vascular sheaths and connective tissue planes to the mediastinum. Considering this proposed mechanism, we hypothesized that some changes associated with the interstitial lung diseases would exist in the lung parenchyma at the onset of pneumomediastinum.",

The CT scans before and at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum was evaluated in random order without knowledge of diagnosis, and the final assessment was achieved by consensus. CT analysis included presence and location of reticular opacity, ground-glass opacity, consolidation, and honeycombing. Ground-glass opacity was defined as areas showing a hazy increase of lung attenuation through which vessels could still be seen. Consolidation was considered present when the opacities obscured the underlying vessels. Honeycombing was defined as end-stage lung damage, which was manifested as multiple thin-wall cysts. 20 The anatomic distribution was noted to be central if there was a predominance of abnormalities in the inner third of the transverse plane, and peripheral if there was a predominance of abnormalities in the outer third of the transverse plane. If abnormalities were seen along the bronchovascular bundle, the distribution was regarded as peribronchial. If the abnormality had no prediction, it was regarded as random distribution. In the craniocaudal direction, zonal predominance was assessed as upper, or lower. Upper lung zonal predominance was considered present when most of the abnormalities were above the level of the tracheal carina, and lower lung zonal predominance was considered present when most of the abnormalities were below this level.",

            "text": "Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is thought to begin with a rapid increase in intra-alveolar pressure, air leaks from the ruptured alveoli and accumulates along the bronchovascular sheath. 17 The basic requirement for alveolar rupture is the existence of a pressure gradient between the alveolus and its surrounding structure. The pressure within the adjacent alveoli is generally assumed to be equal, so the intra-alveolar wall should remain intact. However, when intra-alveolar pressure increases or perivascular interstitial pressure decreases, a gradient is created. In our study, the extent of ground-glass opacity and consolidation was decreased at the detection of pneumomediastinum in patients who had received corticosteroids or immunosuppresive therapy for exacerbation of interstitial lung disease. These patients showed various degrees of improvement following drug therapy. In patients with deterioration of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, ground-glass opacity has been shown to correspond pathologically with acute diffuse alveolar damage or active fibroblastic foci. 22 In these circumstances, alveolar collapse occurs as a result of structural changes, reduced compliance, or obliteration of alveoli. Re-expansion of the alveolus as a result of reacting to drug treatment might increase intra-alveolus pressure. Thus, pneumomediastinum may occur under such circumstances in conjunction with the existence of a damaged alveolar wall. In addition, heterogeneous or partial fibrosis might produce an area of uneven alveolar expansion in which disproportionate alveolar pressure occurs between alveoli. It is assumed there is an increased risk of rupture in the hyperinflated alveolus.",

In a study of 34 patients with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, Fujiwara 1 identified pneumomediastinum on chest CT scans in 5 patients (14.7%). However, they did not assess parenchymal abnormalities at the onset of pneumomediastinum, and assumed that honeycombing and violent cough were predisposing factors for pneumomediastinum. In our patients, the mean score for honeycombing significantly increased at the time of detection of pneumomediastinum, however, there was no patients with prominent clinical symptoms such as violent cough. O'Connor and Thomas. 3 described a case of pneumomediastinum in a patient with fibrosing alveolitis. Fibrosing alveolitis produces area of uneven lung expansion, with hyperinflation and areas of atelectasis. This author assumed there was an increased risk of rupture in the hyperinflated areas of the lung. However, in these previous reports, the mechanism in which the pneumomediastinum arises in patients with interstitial pneumonia was not clarified. On the other hand, Ichikawa et al. 9 reported a case of a patient in whom pneumomediastinum occurred in association with hypersensitive pneumonitis, and on lung biopsy, overdistention or disruption of alveoli with obliteration of the respiratory bronchioles was revealed. They speculated that increased intraalveolar pressure occurring as a result of check valve bronchiolar obstruction induced pneumomediastinum.",

First, there were few pathological diagnoses of interstitial lung disease, because most patients showed comparatively typical CT findings and clinical courses of their respective interstitial lung disease, thus pathological examinations were not required. Second, there was unequable in the period between before and at the onset of pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum might occur before the time of detection on CT scan. Third, the present sample numbers were small for evaluation of differences among various histological types or between idiopathic interstitial pneumonia and collagen vascular disease. Those differences might affect the results. Fourth, there is the possibility by except for interstitial pneumonia on cause of pneumomediastinum. Pneumomediastinum is also generated by violent cough or pulmonary function test. 30 However, our patients had not suffered from violent cough, and there was no case of pneumomediastinum generation for a few days after pulmonary function test.",

Most patients had no clinical symptom such as violent cough at the detection of pneumomediastinum, hence the changes of lung abnormalities probably causes an increase in intra-alveolar pressure. When pneumomediastinum occurs in patients receiving therapy with corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents for acute or subacute exacerbation of interstitial lung disease, increasing opacities, which indicate disease activity, have been shown to decrease. Conversely, when pneumomediastinum occurs in patients who did not receive corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents, the progress of interstitial fibrosis should be considered.",
