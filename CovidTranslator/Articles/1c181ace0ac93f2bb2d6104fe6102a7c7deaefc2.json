            "text": "The concept of microarray technology was first put forward by Ekins (1989) over 20 years ago. An ambient analyte theory was proposed that a tiny spot of a purified antibody or protein provides substantially better sensitivity than when used in conventional immunoassay formats as miniaturized features can dramatically enhance detection sensitivity. Though not exactly the same, DNA microarray technology became the first application of this theory and has been tremendously successful in gene expression profiling and other derivatized applications, such as ChIP-chip (DeRisi et al., 1997; Morley et al., 2004; Pease et al., 1994; Schadt et al., 2003; Schena et al., 1995) . However, RNA expression levels do not always correlate with protein expression levels, and biological functions are carried out primarily by proteins rather than nucleic acids (Gygi et al., 1999; Lueking et al., 2005b) . Therefore, it was the next logical step to develop a miniaturized protein-centered device, namely protein microarrays, for studies of protein functionalities in a high-throughput and highly flexible fashion.",

            "text": "A protein microarray, also known as a protein chip, is formed by immobilization of thousands of different proteins (e.g., antigens, antibodies, enzymes, substrates, etc.) in discrete spatial locations at a highdensity solid surface (typically glass) (Smith et al., 2005; Tao et al., 2007) . On the basis of their applications, protein microarrays can be classified into two types: analytical and functional protein microarrays ( Fig. 4.1) . Analytical protein microarrays are usually composed of well-characterized biomolecules with specific binding activities, such as antibodies, to analyze the components of complex biological samples (e.g., serum and cell lysates) or to determine whether a sample contains a specific protein of interest. They have been used for protein expression profiling, biomarker identification, cell surface marker/glycosylation profiling, clinical diagnosis, and environmental/food safety analysis (Kumble, 2003) . On the other hand, functional protein microarrays are constructed by printing a large number of individually purified proteins and are mainly used to comprehensively query biochemistry properties and activities of those immobilized proteins. In principle, it is feasible to print arrays composed of virtually all annotated proteins of a given organism, effectively comprising a whole-proteome microarray. Functional protein microarrays have been successfully applied to identify protein-protein, protein-lipid, protein-antibody, protein-small molecules, protein-DNA, protein-RNA, lectin-glycan, and lectin-cell interactions, and to identify substrates or enzymes in phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, acetylation, and nitrosylation, as well as to profile immune response. In this chapter, we will mainly focus on the fabrication and application of functional protein microarrays in basic and clinical research. ",

Therefore, the design and construction of oligonucleotide DNA microarrays are relatively straightforward. However, the protein world is manifested by much more complicated biochemistries, which are reflected by vast differences in protein size, shape/conformation, charge, stability, and hydrophobicity, to name a few. Furthermore, many proteins are known to require proper partners to be able to execute their biochemical activities. This implies that the fabrication and analysis of protein microarrays is substantially more challenging than that of DNA microarrays. Unlike DNA or RNA molecules, full-length proteins cannot be directly synthesized in vitro at high efficiency. Although in vitro synthesis of peptides has been feasible for decades, it still suffers from low yield, high cost, and effective limitation to short sequences. Moreover, the vast majority of proteins must be correctly folded and modified to be functional during and after translation, which may require a complex molecular machinery of chaperones and other accessory molecules that cannot be fully recapitulated in vitro. Therefore, the development of a high-throughput method that allows for purifying proteins under native conditions is the key to fabricate functional protein microarrays of high content.",

Individual cDNA clones of this library were robotically arrayed onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane laid on top of agar media and allowed to grow to full size. These cells were then lysed in situ to extract proteins. The usefulness of such an array was first demonstrated by incubation with a labeled test protein to identify interacting partners (Bussow et al., 1998) . Strictly speaking, besides the fact that only one-sixth of the cDNAs are in the proper reading frames, those correctly expressed human proteins bound to the nitrocellulose membranes were not purifieddthe majority of the proteins in every spot were bacterial proteins. Furthermore, the proteins were neither unique nor in their native conformation, given the redundancy of the library and denaturing conditions used to break the bacteria open. Though powerful as a screening technique in early days, this particular experimental strategy had limited general applications (Holt et al., 2000; Lueking et al., 1999) .",

            "text": "To overcome these hurdles, Zhu et al. (2001) in the Snyder group created a high-throughput protein purification protocol in the budding yeast ( Fig. 4. 2). Using a homologous recombination-based strategy, more than 5800 full-length yeast open reading frames (ORFs) were cloned into .2 Fabrication of high-content functional protein microarrays. Four major steps are involved to construct a functional protein microarray of high content. First, a high-quality ORF expression library is constructed to allow inducible overexpression of GST-His6 fused recombinant proteins in yeast. Second, a high-throughput protein purification protocol is applied to individually purify thousands of proteins from yeast. The purified proteins are stored in 384-well format. Third, silver stain and immunoblot analysis are employed to evaluate the quality and quantity of the purified proteins. Finally, when purified proteins pass the quality control, they are spotted in duplicate to glass slides using a robot microarrayer. The quality of printing is then tested by anti-GST probing. An image of a human protein microarray probed with anti-GST is shown in the lower panel. For color version of this figure, the reader is referred to the online version of this book. a yeast expression vector that, upon galactose induction, produces glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged N-terminal fusion proteins. The purification protocol took advantage of both a 96-well format and immobilized affinity chromatography. This strategy allowed parallel purification of unprecedented numbers of proteinsdup to 1152 per day. The success of this approach is built upon several unique aspects. First, it utilizes a eukaryotic expression system that both generates high levels of recombinant proteins and tends to produce a high fraction of soluble proteins. Compared with bacterial expression systems, in which a large fraction of recombinant proteins end up in inclusion bodies, this is a huge advantage when a large number of eukaryotic proteins are being generated. Second, the expression of recombinant proteins is only induced over about two total cell cycles, which greatly reduces toxicity and cell death. Third, a foreign eukaryotic protein purified from yeast is more likely to be active because posttranslational modifications necessary for function are more likely to occur correctly than in either bacteria or a cell-free system. Forth, the use of an N-terminal GST tag helps protein fold correctly and therefore improve its stability and solubility. Other commonly used tags include the so-called TAP tag, MPB, and Hisx6, to name a few. In fact, the same group later went on to build a TAP-tagged yeast ORF collection and purified >5,000 yeast proteins (Gelperin et al., 2005) .",

Aside from the cost of protein production, fabrication of a proteome microarray requires construction of an expressible collection of full-length ORFs, which can be both challenging and expensive when dealing with higher eukaryotes with a large number of genes, such as humans. To explore alternative approaches, several groups have attempted to test the in vitro transcription/translation systems, such as the E. coli, wheat germ, and rabbit reticulocyte systems. In these systems, proteins can be expressed directly from cDNA templates (Allen and Miller, 1999) , which can be obtained through polymerase chain reaction amplification without the lengthy and costly process of subcloning. For example, the E. coli cell-free protein expression system has been used to synthesize proteins in a 96-well format (Murthy et al., 2004) , and the improved wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system has been applied to the in vitro expression of 13,364 human proteins (Goshima et al., 2008) . More recently, the Felgner group has published a series of articles describing fabrication of protein microarrays in a variety of bacteria by directly spotting in vitro translated protein mixtures to glass (Crompton et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2011) . However, although these systems can significantly decrease the reaction volume required for generation of recombinant proteins (Angenendt et al., 2004) , the impurity of the translated proteins limits their applications.",

Similarly, in the Nucleic Acid Programmable Protein Array (NAPPA) technology, biotinylated cDNA plasmids encoding proteins as GST fusions are printed onto avidin-coated slides, together with anti-GST antibodies as the capture molecules (Ramachandran et al., 2004) . The cDNA array is then incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate to express the proteins, which become trapped by the antibodies adjacent to each DNA spot. Recently, NAPPA has been successfully expanded to high-density arrays of 1000 different proteins (Ramachandran et al., 2008) .

Fluorescent dyes, such as Cy-3/5 and their equivalent, have been used as a popular labeling method. Because most good dyes have relatively narrow excitation and emission spectra, multicolor scheme can be readily implemented for simultaneous detection and direct comparison of different samples, both reducing cost and avoiding chip-to-chip variation. Semiconductor quantum dot labeling, which is brighter and more stable than organic dyes, has also been applied to protein microarrays (Shingyoji et al., 2005; Zajac et al., 2007) .",

Enzymatic signal amplification is also a valuable labeling method. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) has been developed for protein microarray assays. For low abundance protein samples, the sensitivity of traditional fluorescence or chemiluminescence detection is relatively low, whereas RCA can detect captured proteins at femtomole level and is promising to improve the sensitivity of fluorescent detection (Lizardi et al., 1998; Schweitzer et al., 2000; Schweitzer et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2004) . Tyramide signal amplification is another way to amplify signals with enzymes, which utilizes the horseradish peroxidase conjugated on secondary antibodies to convert the labeled substrates (tyramide) into short-lived extremely reactive intermediates, which then very rapidly react with and covalently bind to adjacent proteins (Varnum et al., 2004) .",

Optical techniques of various types are emerging as an important tool for mentoring the dynamics of biomolecule interactions on a solid surface. For instance, Imaging Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy (SPR) (Nelson et al., 1999; Thiel et al., 1997) , Imaging Optical Ellipsometry (OE) (Wang and Jin, 2003) , and Reflectometric Interference Spectroscopy (Piehler et al., 1997) are three label-free optical techniques that in essence measure the same optical dielectric response of a thin film and therefore detect changes of physical or chemical properties of the thin film, such as thickness and mass density during biochemical reactions.",

            "text": "During the development of various assay types, it became obvious that surface chemistry plays an important role in the success of a new assay (Table 4 .1). For example, protein-DNA interactions were first performed on the yeast proteome microarrays on a nitrocellulose surface (i.e., FAST slide) with randomly shared yeast genomic DNA fragments that were labeled with Cy5 (Hall et al., 2004) . Later, Hu et al. (2009) also found that the FAST slide, among other tested surfaces, produced the best signal-to-noise ratio for DNA-binding assays. In another example, when our group was developing protein acetylation reactions using 14 C-labeled Ac-CoA as a donor, we first tested the NuA4 acetylation reaction using histone H3 and H4 as substrates on FAST slides, as well as aldehyde-and Ni-NTA-coated slides (Lin et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011) . The results were clear that both FAST and nickel surfaces worked, but FAST surface produced better signal-to-noise ratios (Fig. 4.4) . However, FAST surface was not suitable for phosphorylation reactions because the background noises were too high Zhu et al., 2009) . Another interest case is to develop an assay for profiling cell surface glycans on a lectin microarray. We and others found that so far the only proper surface for this type of binding assays is a commercial Schott slide, although the exact surface chemistry is not revealed (Hsu et al., 2006; Pilobello et al., 2007; Tao et al., 2008) . Several reasons may be accounted for the importance of surface chemistry. First, for low-affinity binding assays (e.g., protein-DNA interactions), a porous surface (e.g., FAST) is likely to retain more proteins and hence improving sensitivity. Second, when radioisotope-labeled small molecules are used, it is important to completely remove unincorporated radioisotopes from the surface to reduce background noise. This might explain why phosphorylation does not work well on FAST surface. Third, in the case of using live cells to probe a lectin microarray, the grafted chemical ligands must not be too repulsive to cells. Other factors, such as protein conformation and stability, can also be affected by surface chemistry. Therefore, whenever a novel assay is to be developed, a variety of surfaces should be tested first in a pilot study.",

In addition, using liposomes as a carrier for various PIPs, they identified more than 150 binding proteins, more than 50% of which were known membrane-associated proteins. Popescu et al. (2007) developed a protein microarray containing 1,133 Arabidopsis thaliana proteins and also used it to globally identify proteins bind to calmodulins or calmodulin-like proteins in Arabidopsis. A large number of previously known and novel targets were identified, including transcription (Robinson et al., 2002) factors (TFs), receptor and intracellular protein kinases, F-box proteins, RNA-binding proteins, and proteins of unknown function. Alternative approaches to identifying protein-protein interactions, such as the yeast twohybrid system and protein complex purification coupled with mass spectrometry analysis, are well-established, however, and are used as standard high-throughput methods to detect protein-protein interactions in higher eukaryotes (Krogan et al., 2006; Vidal et al., 1996) .

Surprisingly, over 300 proteins that were previously unknown to specifically interact with DNA showed sequence-specific PDIs, suggesting that many human proteins may bind specific DNA sequences as a moonlighting function. To further investigate whether the DNA-binding activities of these unconventional DNA binding proteins (uDBPs) were physiologically relevant, we carried out in-depth analysis on a well-studied protein kinase, Erk2, to determine the potential mechanism behind its DNA-binding activity. Using a series of in vitro and in vivo approaches, such as electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), luciferase assay, mutagenesis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), we demonstrated that the DNA-binding activity of Erk2 is independent of its protein kinase activity and it acts as a transcription repressor of transcripts induced by interferon gamma signaling (Hu et al., 2009) . Other than Erk2, many other uDBPs show sequence-specific DNA-binding activity, and more intriguingly, many of their consensus sequences are highly similar to those recognized by annotated TFs (Fig. 4.5) . This observation suggests that these uDBPs may synergistically work with the TFs to achieve highly accurate transcription regulation. Examples of proteins sharing similar DNA binding profiles. Each peak represents normalized signal intensity of a specific DNA motif probe, with individual motifs organized along the X-axis by sequence similarity.

Biomarker identification Though the applications described above are most useful in basic research, functional protein microarrays may have enormous impacts on clinical diagnosis and prognosis. When proteins on a functional protein microarray are viewed as potential antigens that may or may not associated with a particular disease, it becomes a powerful tool in biomarker identification. The principle is straightforward: when an autoantibody presented in human sera associated with a human disease (e.g., autoimmune diseases) recognizes a human protein spotted on the array, it can be readily detected with fluorescently labeled anti-human immunoglobulin antibodies (e.g., anti-IgG) and a profile of autoantibodies associated with a disease thus created, providing a rapid approach to identifying potential disease biomarkers (Fig. 4.7) . For example, Robinson et al. (2002) reported the first application of protein microarray technology to profile multiple human disease sera. They constructed a microarray with 196 biomolecules shown to be autoantigens in eight human autoimmune diseases, including proteins, peptides, enzyme complexes, ribonucleoprotein complexes, DNA, and posttranslationally modified antigens. The arrays were incubated with patient sera to study the specificity and pathogenesis of autoantibody responses and were used to identify and define relevant autoantigens in human autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. Hu et al. (2007) reported a new approach for high-throughput characterization of monoclonal antibody target specificity using a protein microarray composed of 1,058 unique human liver proteins. They immunized mice with live cells from human livers, isolated 54 hybridomas with binding activities to human cells, and identified the corresponding antigens for five monoclonal antibodies via screening on the protein microarray. Expression profiles of the corresponding antigens of the five antibodies were characterized by using tissue microarrays, and one of the antigens, eIF1A, was found to be expressed in normal human liver but not in hepatocellular carcinoma. Other applications include biomarker identification for ovarian cancer (Hudson et al., 2007) , inflammatory bowel disease (Chen et al., 2009) , alopecia areata (Lueking et al., 2005a) , and autoimmune hepatitis (Song et al., 2010) .",

Proteins spotted on a functional microarray can be viewed as potential autoantigens that may be associated with a particular disease (e.g., autoimmune diseases). (A) To identify such autoantigens, a protein microarray is blocked, incubated with diluted serum sample, washed, and a fluorescently labeled anti-human IgG is used to detect captured autoantibodies. Following statistic analyses (e.g., SAM) can be used to identify potential autoantigens associated with the disease of interest. (B).

These microarrays could quickly distinguish patient serum samples as SARS positive or SARS negative based on the presence of human IgG and IgM antibodies against SARS-CoV proteins, with a 94% accuracy compared with standard diagnostic methods.

            "text": "Another interesting application of the functional protein microarray is to elucidate the molecular mechanism as how a pathogen (e.g., a virus) hijacks the host pathways and machineries for its own replication. The application of high-throughput approaches has uncovered many new host factors that regulate the life cycle of infecting viruses, such as global RNAi-based screens (Brass et al., 2009; Karlas et al., 2010; Shapira et al., 2009) . However, correlating this information with a fundamental underling mechanism is often challenging. Our group in collaboration with the Hayward group hypothesized that conserved proteins from related viruses would tend to target the same host pathways using similar mechanisms (Li et al., in press ). Herpesviruses all encode conserved serine/threonine kinases that play an important role in virus replication and spread. We utilized a human protein microarray to identify shared host targets of the conserved kinases encoded by four human herpesviruses and discovered that the DNA damage pathway was statistically enriched for shared substrates. Using the gamma herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), we demonstrated that the EBV kinase activates an upstream mediator of the DNA damage response, the histone acetyltransferase TIP60. EBV also utilizes the chromatin remodeling function of TIP60 in a positive feedback loop to enhance expression of EBV genes needed for virus replication. Identification of key cellular targets of the conserved herpesvirus kinases will facilitate the development of broadly effective antiviral strategies. This work provides a new paradigm for the discovery of key virus-host interactions.",

            "text": "Recent years have witnessed a rapid growth in using functional protein microarrays for basic research (Tao et al., 2007) . Although the technology is still at a relatively early stage of development, it has become obvious that the protein microarray platform can and will act as a versatile tool suitable for the large-scale high-throughput biology, especially in the areas of profiling PTMs and in analysis of signal transduction networks and pathways (Hu et al., 2009; Ptacek et al., 2005) . As another crucial proteomics technology, recent progress in mass spectrometry has allowed global profiling of PTMs using a shotgun approach. For example, the Zhao, Mann, and Guan groups recently identified numerous acetylated lysine residues in metabolic enzymes in mice and human cells without knowing the upstream HATs (Choudhary et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2010) . In parallel, our team also identified many yeast metabolic enzymes as substrates of the NuA4 acetylation complex without knowing the actual modified sites (Lin et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2011) . Therefore, we envision that the combination of the two technologies will have enormous potential to both identify critical regulatory PTMs at the resolution of modified individual amino acids and to identify the enzymes that mediate these effects. Another emerging direction is in the forefront of understanding the molecular mechanisms of pathogen-host interactions. In the same manner in which we identified host proteins that recognized the SLD loop of the BMV virus, functional protein microarrays (e.g., a human protein microarray) can be used to discover those host proteins targeted by pathogens (e.g., HIV, HCV, and SARS-CoV). The identification of the host targets of a virus will provide alternative therapeutics that cannot be rapidly evaded via mutation of the viral genomes (Brass et al., 2009) . In conclusion, the potential of functional protein microarrays is only just now starting to reveal itself. It is expected that it will become an indispensable and invaluable tool in proteomics and systems biology research.",

Third, silver stain and immunoblot analysis are employed to evaluate the quality and quantity of the purified proteins. Finally, when purified proteins pass the quality control, they are spotted in duplicate to glass slides using a robot microarrayer. The quality of printing is then tested by anti-GST probing.
