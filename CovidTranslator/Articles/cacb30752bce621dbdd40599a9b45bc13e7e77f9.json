Built 2500 years BCE, Stonehenge in the British Isles is thought to be the first monument and evidence of mass gatherings in the Pre-Historic era [1] . Numerous burial sites have been found at the now designated UNESCO World Heritage Site adding to the belief that it was a focus of spiritual energy and ritual. Christian pilgrimage to the Holy Land has been recorded since the 4th century. The Hajj, Islam's great pilgrimage, has existed for fourteen centuries of which a body of literature devoted to the travelogues of the Hajj has existed for over ten centuries [2] . In 1750, Thomas Gray's 'Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard' referred to the 'Madding Crowd's ignoble strife' at once holding forth the sobriety on common ordinary country folk in contrast to the madding crowd which drove men to disgraceful uncontrolled and even violent behavior captured in the timeless phrase [3] . In 1852 Charles McKay published his treatise on \"Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds\" writing that 'Men, it has well been said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one,\". In 1874, the great writer Thomas Hardy wrote a novel which still remains recognized as a masterpiece of English literature, \"Far from the Madding Crowd,' focusing on the lives of rural dwellers who were left behind by the madding crowd of industrialization. Even today the 'madness of crowds' continues to fascinate and enthrall.",

The civil rights movements sweeping across the United States in the1960s and the crowds that cycles of violent lynchings had drawn prior, first captured the attention of Behavioral Scientists interested in public gatherings. Psychologists referred to the 'collective mind' (first observed by 1895 thinker Gustav Le Bon) that developed when large numbers of people gathered to be together, and the 'de-individuation' that followed as a result whereby not individuals, but the larger group determines actions accounting for violence destruction and even murder that could result [4] . Two schools of investigation developed, those focusing on disaster reliefthe public health needs of large number of people escaping or evacuating from a threat-and those who studied protest events. While many theories of behavior were proposed, researches remained mostly removed from the gatherings themselves and very little research was performed by direct observation of public gatherings themselves. At the time, modern travel had not yet permitted some of the massive scale of gatherings which have become commonplace since the late twentieth century.",

As many as three and a half million Muslims from 187 countries around the world gather for what is considered the final pillar in Islam returning them to Islam's birthplace in order to perform Hajj. Hajj is a series of week-long religious rites retracing the Prophet Mohammed's final visit to Mecca during which he drew the lines of Islamic pilgrimage which still stand today and delivered his Final Sermon revealing the final verses of the Quran and sealing the foundations of Islamic belief. Even today, true to the Prophet Mohammed's final Hajj, the modern Hajj incorporates the Prophet Abraham's footsteps centuries before Islam's inception and the legends of Hagar, Ishmael, Adam and Eve.",

Also, once a local Muslim in KSA has been to Hajj, Hajj visas cannot be issued for the next five years limiting frequent performers of hajj. Yet the major improvements in Hajj crowd management have been through engineering: the multilevel bridge at Jamarat, site of the stoning ritual which has been a previous site of stampedes at Hajj; the re-engineering of the pillars at Mina into elliptical columns in place of cylindrical columns to dissipate crowd densities and reduce crowd turbulence from developing, and the development of massive pedestrian causeways which are color coded, one way, and temporally controlled to ensure steady throughput of pilgrims by controlling pilgrim ingress into these causeways through optimized schedules. Movement of the Hajj crowds in these areas of high density and high emotion -both risk factors for stampede-is monitored in realtime through video graphic analysis. Intervention can be implemented real-time, which can be both life-and limb-saving. Detailed video recordings achieved at Hajj examining crowd dynamics are primarily the means of assessing the flow of Hajj crowds. In the future, more sophisticated assessment is likely to be achieved in a number of additional ways-through fixed-laser scanning devices, closed circuit television and fixed GPS monitors [25, 27] .",

The Hillsborough Stadium stampede was among the most disastrous events in Football and examining its causes has been instructive if extremely painful for the football community and Britain in particular [28, 29] . The 1989 FA Cup Semi-Final was held in the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield on April 15th, 1989 drawing two intense rivals-Liverpool and Nottingham Forest -for a contest place in the Final for the FA Cupthe biggest sporting event in British Football [30]. 24,000 Liverpool fans traveled to Sheffield for the event. Authorities knew of the rivalries between both teams and because of the propensity for vandalism and hooliganism among fans on both teams, their entry to the stadium was deliberately segregated, as were the 'pens' designated for fans of each team. Because of the bottleneck at the entrance and the large numbers of attendees, fans initially poured into two central 'standing only' pens-sections of the stadium demarcated by wire barriers, unaware that to either side of them thousands of empty seats were available. No one directed the congregating crowds to these more lateral areas on the right and left. As the time for kick-off was only minutes away, the Chief Superintendent (the police commander in charge of the event) allowed an additional gate to open as lines of Liverpool supporters outside the stadium had built up. Unaware that in the central standing pens crowd density was already high, the surge of 2000 additional people resulted in 96 deaths-men women and children and more than 766 injuries. All except one were Liverpool fans. Hillsborough remains the worst disaster in British sporting history. In 2016, British Jurors, delebrating for 259 days (the longest inquest in British history)-emerged to convict the Chief Superintendent \"responsible for manslaughter by gross negligence\" due to a breach of his duty of care. The tragedy was compounded by the fact that the Hillsborough Match had been the first mass gathering under his command. This spiritual commitment which is of the utmost priority for them to complete Hajj to the best of their abilities adding to a religious intensity and focused commitment despite harsh and difficult physical conditions imposed on the pilgrim whether by climate or congestion often in the face of sleep deprivation and other forms of self-denial required in the spiritual state of the Hajjee.",

In this way Hajj, like other religious mass gatherings, is infused with a collective spirituality that can be of enormous public health benefit. Further, this spirit of protecting the entire Muslim community is clearly deleinated in the teachings of Islam to be a metaphor for life beyond Hajj for all the world's Muslim community-a reminder that we must live together in harmony to peacefully collaborate and support one another through hardship and vulnerability. Additionally, these values greatly enhance the pilgrim populations' receptivity to public health planners and on site security in ensuring disaster management and crisis aversion can be achieved with as much cooperation as possible.",

Both MDMA (3,4 Methylenedioxy-N-Methylamphetamine) and the notoriously named date rape drug (gamma hydroxybutyric acid) are liberally used at these events. Lund et al. report that in a fifteen year period 68 deaths were recorded of drug related overdose at Electronic Music Dance Events. Violence at such events has also been recorded with participants reporting stabbingssome severe enough to result in tube thoracostomy. Matters are worsened by the fact that many participants self report ' preloading'drinking alcohol prior to entry to the event, a common practice at American events which can occur during 'tailgating'when Americans often picnic around the trunk of their cars in the parking lots of the venues. While for most American families this means an innocent meal of hamburgers and hot dogs, for youngsters attending rave events this could mean 'preloading' particularly if attendees to the raves are under legal drinking age, adding to their vulnerability.",

As a result of the matches, back in the team's home state of North Carolina, two mass gatherings assembled on two consecutive nights drawing a total of 52,000 fans. Celebrating their team, they lit bonfires in the downtown area of Chapel Hill where they were congregating and began fire jumpingjumping and dancing through the flames by way of a victory dance. A total of 58 revelers needed medical care including 27 from the on-the-ground EMS responders and a total of 49 who needed emergency room admission. The average age of the injured was 23.8 years and they were predominantly male. Most -65%had medical complaints relating to alcohol and didn't need hospital admission.

Further, such spontaneous gatherings are componded by the use of excessive alcohol and illicit drugs.

Important data reported by Sampsel et al. reveals that sexual assault occurs at mass gatherings peaking on specific holiday events-New Years Eve, Canada Day, Halloween and University Freshmans' week. Women were more often assaulted if they were of younger age, had consumed alcohol or drugs and unlike most sexual violence which befalls women aged 18 to 30, the assailant at mass gatherings was not previously known to the victim. More often than not, victims declined to release the findings of their 'rape kit' as evidence to the police in the hope of seeking prosecution. The sexual assaults at these mass gatherings occurred both within a friend's home and also outdoors, as in Tahrir square. Unlike sexual assaults occurring independent of mass gatherings, the majority of women did not know their assailants suggesting perpetrators may seek out mass gatherings as cover for predicating sexual assault on vulnerable victims. Sampsel noted the increase in sexual assault events in conjunction with mass gatherings which fell on Canadian holidays and surmised that in this occassions the consumption of excess alcohol was more likely. Sexual assault transpires much more often when the victim has consumed excess alcohol often spiked with covert drugs in an effort to render the victim unconscious and unable to resist assault. These patterns support the view that the nature of the revelry, and the young female revelers assembling in this gatherings are additionally vulnerable because of social behaviors at such mass gatherings leading to drug faciliated sexual assault.",
