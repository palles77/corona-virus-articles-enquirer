Canine influenza virus (CIV), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine distemper virus (CDV), canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV), canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) and canine herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1), are all associated with the CIRDC. To allow diagnosis, two conventional multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were developed to simultaneously identify four RNA and two DNA viruses associated with CIRDC. The two multiplex PCR assays were then validated on 102 respiratory samples collected from 51 dogs with respiratory illness by sensitivity and specificity determination in comparison to conventional simplex PCR and a rapid three-antigen test kit. All six viruses were detected in either individual or multiple infections. The developed multiplex PCR assays had a >87% sensitivity and 100% specificity compared to their simplex counterpart. Compared to the three-antigen test kit, the multiplex PCR assays yielded 100% sensitivity and more than 83% specificity for detection of CAdV-2 and CDV, but not for CIV. Therefore, the developed multiplex PCR modalities were able to simultaneously diagnose a panel of CIRDC viruses and facilitated specimen collection through being suitable for use of nasal or oral samples.

            "text": "Canine infectious respiratory disease complex (CIRDC), also known as kennel cough or infectious tracheobronchitis, is a highly acute respiratory disease in dogs that affects the larynx, trachea, bronchi and, occasionally, the nasal mucosa [3, 21] . The CIRDC is not only associated with infectious pathogens, but environmental factors and host immune responses also play an equally important role [7] . The pathogens causing CIRDC consist of viruses, bacteria or both, and are airborne-transmitted from infected dogs, particularly those living in poorly ventilated kennels, animal shelters and veterinary hospitals [3] . A CIRDC infection usually results in delaying of rehoming, interruption of training courses and requires high cost treatments [7] . Mildly productive cough and nasal discharge initially present as the most common clinical signs, which is self-limited within a short period in most infected dogs. It is not fatal unless other complicating factors are involved, such as secondary bacterial infection or an immunosuppressed condition [7] . Several episodes of CIRDC infection have been shown for a variety of viral agents. Canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV) is the most frequently detected agent in CIRDC dogs [16] . Canine adenovirus type 2 (CAdV-2) and canine distemper virus (CDV) have also frequently been reported in dogs with severe respiratory distress [7, 16, 17] . Canine herpesvirus 1 (CaHV-1) has been isolated from both puppies and adult dogs with fatal dyspnea [3, 7] . Canine influenza virus (CIV) [14, 16] and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) have recently been discovered from the respiratory tract of dogs with flu-like symptoms during a massive human flu outbreak [5, 6, 8] .",

Various diagnostic tests are available for these infections. However, many are not practical due to their time-consuming process, poor specificity or sensitivity, and costly diagnostic tools [10] . Thus, a rapid molecular technique is an appropriate method of choice for CIRDC virus detection. Because multiple viruses cause CIRDC, including co-infections, a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was developed and has become commercially available as a test for respiratory tract infections [1, 10, 13, 18] . Recently, multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR) has largely replaced the conventional counterpart in order to increase the sensitivity. However, it is challenging, in terms of financial support, in developing countries and so is limited in clinical and practical uses. Thus, using a multiplex PCR would be simple, sensitive and cost-effective to screen for CIRDC viruses. Accordingly, two multiplex PCR assays were developed in this study for the simultaneous detection of CIV, CPIV, CDV, CRCoV, CAdV-2 and CaHV-1.",

Reactions were performed using 3Prime G Gradient Thermal Cycle (Techne, Bristol, U.K.). Cycling conditions were comprised of an initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 30 sec. The final extension was performed at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. Subsequently, the amplified CRCoV product of the first round PCR, and cDNA of the other RNA viruses (CIV, CPIV and CDV) and extracted DNA viruses (CAdV-2 and CaHV-1) were used as a template for further simplex PCR studies. Gradient simplex PCR was performed for each virus. All reaction compositions were as mentioned above, but the gradient annealing temperature (Ta) was programmed ranging from 50\u00b0C to 59\u00b0C in order to optimize the reaction. Thermal cycling was performed with 95\u00b0C for 5 min, then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 1 min, varied Ta for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and then finally 72\u00b0C for 10 min.

            "text": "The CIRDC is an important disease that impacts on dogs, especially puppies or immunosuppressed dogs, and is frequently associated with viral infections. It has gained attention recently, because many viruses have been discovered and co-infections with multiple pathogens are often fatal. Thus, the development of diagnostic tools for CIRDC-associated virus detection is necessary to enhance the diagnosis coverage. In this study, multiplex RT-PCR and multiplex PCR for the detection of CIRDC-associated RNA and DNA viruses, respectively, were developed and compared with conventional methods. Both developed multiplex PCRs could detect several viruses associated with CIRDC efficiently. The two multiplex PCRs gave similar results equivalent to that obtained from the conventional simplex PCRs that could only detect one pathogen per reaction and so required six separate reactions per sample. Nested amplification was performed for CRCoV detection in order to increase the sensitivity of detection (Poovorawan, personal communication). Although multiplex PCR has been developed previously to detect several pathogens of CIRDC, such as CIV, CDV and CRCoV [10], its application remained limited because of the narrow range of viruses covered, with other CIRDC-associated viruses being neither detected nor ruled out. Thus, our study might provide a novel platform for whole CIRDC-virus detection. The overall sensitivity of the multiplex RT-PCR and multiplex PCR was more than 90% and 87%, respectively, compared to their simplex counterparts. However, the detection of CRCoV was modified as a hemi-nested RT-PCR to increase its sensitivity. The false negative reactions when performing multiplex PCRs in this study might be resulted from the selection of the single optimized Ta for several primer pairs and the low amount of particular target genes [1] . These suggested for the decreased sensitivity of the developed multiplex PCRs. Moreover, there was 100% specificity in both modalities for clinical sample detection. Thus, these platforms could likely be used effectively in practice. Recently, some multiplex PCR assays were developed in order to detect the CIRDC pathogens [10]; however, the test might be immature, because only CIV, CDV and CRCoV could be detected but not for others. Thus, our study expanded the coverage of CIRDC virus detection. In an evaluation of the commercially available three-antigen rapid test kit (CAdV-2, CIV and CDV), we found only CIV detection showed an unexpected sensitivity and specificity. A previous study reported that the developed multiplex RT-PCR for H3N2 CIV, CDV and CRCoV detection had an almost 100% sensitivity and specificity compared with the conventional RT-PCR and rapid antigen test kit [10] . In contrast, our study showed that the CIV-positive samples by multiplex RT-PCR were negative when tested with the rapid antigen test kit. This is consistent with reports that many rapid test kits might have a low sensitivity to detect the influenza virus, but could still be suitable for rapid in-house clinical applications [11, 15] . This reflects that the type of kit, viral copy number, duration of storage, route of sample collection, and type or virus strain may all influence the test results [19] . Interestingly, in this study, about 70% (71/102) of samples from the clinical respiratory illness dogs were found to have multiple infections. This finding supports that symptomatically, the CIRDC is a complex disease, which is mostly caused by coinfection with more than one pathogen. Recently, Jeoung et al. (2013) used both NS and whole blood samples for CIRDC virus detection, but found that only CDV (and not CIV and CRCoV) could be detected from the whole blood samples [10]. Correspondingly, respiratory swabs have been reported to be appropriate samples for the detection of respiratory pathogens [9, 16] . Thus, NS and OS served as appropriate sample sources in our study due to their ease of and noninvasive sampling nature and that they lie on the viral shedding routes. This study also suggested that the virus should be screened for in NS and OS, with detection levels at each site depending on the type of virus. The CAdV-2 and CaHV-1 mostly replicate in the lower respiratory tracts and shed via respiratory discharge, consisting with our finding that they were mostly detected in the OS, even though NS could often detect these viruses as well. However, the CAdV-2 primer pair used in this study was able to amplify CAdV-1 DNA virus which also shows airborne transmission and replicates in tonsil [3] . Therefore, the positive PCR reaction for canine adenovirus could not discriminate between CAdV-1 and CAdV-2 in this study. Additionally, CaHV-1 can be latent in various nerve ganglions, resulting in negative results from nucleic acid-based CaHV-1 detection in respiratory discharges in non-symptomatic dogs [12] . In this study, 3 out of 15 vaccinated dogs receiving, at least once, combined vaccine against CPIV, CDV and CAdV-2 showed PCR positive results for CIRDC virus detection (2 CDV positive dogs and 1 CPIV positive dog). Even though live attenuated vaccines can give false positive results with molecular testing, it is essential to discriminate between wild-type infection and recent vaccination for the prevention of false positivity in the future. This study documented CaHV-1 and CRCoV circulation in Thailand for the first time. In 2012, CIV H3N2 was discovered in Thailand from dogs with flu-like symptoms [2] . Here, CIV and CRCoV were the most frequently detected viruses in CIRDC-infected dogs, suggesting that the viruses might spread rapidly. These viruses were not only found in single infections, but they were also found as co-infections together or with other viruses.",

However, it has previously been reported that infection with CRCoV and CPIV might facilitate or initiate the disease and, subsequently, enhance the entry of other pathogens [7], so the prevalence of infected dogs is then increased. Moreover, we found that the dogs that were infected with CIV, CPIV, CDV and CRCoV showed a greater severity of clinical symptoms, such as marked bronchopneumonia and sudden death (data not shown). This finding is consistent with other investigations suggesting that co-infections might augment the severity of clinical symptoms [7, 16] . Thus, advanced genetic-based detection methods, such as multiplex PCR assays, are considered as an alternative diagnostic platform for a panel of suspected CIRDC causing viruses with a high sensitivity and specificity. Because of the cost benefit and practical usage, the developed multiplex PCR assays are suitable for a screening test for disease diagnosis, quarantine and prevention measures, especially in ",
