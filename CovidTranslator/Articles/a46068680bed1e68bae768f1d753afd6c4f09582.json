These recombinants produce S polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 68, 86, 135, and 200 kDa, respectively. Expression of the recombinant antigen driven by Ad5 promoters was inhibited by the insertion of an exogenous SV-40 promoter. Most of the recombinant antigens remain intracytoplasmic in infected cells. All the recombinant-directed expression products contain functional antigenic sites C and B (Gebauer et al., 1991, Virology 183, 225-238). The recombinant antigen of 135 kDa and that of 200 kDa, which represents the whole spike protein, also contain antigenic sites D and A, which have previously been shown to be the major inducers of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, here we show that recombinant S protein fragments expressing only sites C and B also induced TGEV-neutralizing antibodies. The chimeric Ad5-TGEV recombinants elicited lactogenic immunity in hamsters, including the production of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies. The antisera induced in swine by the Ad5 recombinants expressing the amino-terminal 26% of the spike protein (containing sites C and B) or the full-length spike protein, when mixed with a lethal dose of virus prior to administration to susceptible piglets, delayed or completely prevented the induction of symptoms of disease, respectively. \u1b67",

Sera collected at 0, 32, 47, 87, and, in some cases, at 105 and 115 days postinfection were evaluated by RIA and neutralization against TGEV. Mean serum titers and standard deviation errors are represented for each time point. The titer by RIA was defined as the inverse of the highest antibody dilution giving a binding three times higher than the background in the RIA assay. The NI was defined as the log 10 of the ratio of the PFU after incubating the virus in the presence of medium or the indicated antiserum.",

These data indicate that the amino-terminal S protein fragment might be relevant to confer enteric acid 219 (or residues close to it) might be involved in the loss of enteric tropism (S\u00e1 nchez et al., 1992) . These fac-tropism by complementing the binding of N-aminopeptidase (identified as a major TGEV receptor) to an S protein tors might be the presence of a second receptor binding site recognized by a putative second receptor (Enjuanes domain mapping close to antigenic site A (Delmas et al., 1992; Godet et al., 1994) . Another observation supports with higher titers in swine than in hamsters, although both species were permissive to virus infection. S protein this hypothesis. Ad5 vectors have been used to express the amino-terminal 564 aa of PRCV S protein, resulting has been previously expressed using E. coli (Hu et al., 1984 (Hu et al., , 1987 or poxviruses (Pulford and Britton, 1991) , but in production of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies (Callebaut et al., 1994) which did not protect against challenge with TGEV-neutralizing antibodies were only elicited with recombinant poxviruses. Expression of S antigenic site D, virulent TGEV (Callebaut and Pensaert, 1995). By contrast, the Ad-TS recombinant eliciting antiserum provid-as a fusion protein on the surface of E. coli led to induction of TGEV-neutralizing antibodies when purified re-ing passive protection against challenge with virulent TGEV carries S sequences derived from TGEV instead combinant antigen was used as immunogen, but not when live vector was administered (Bousquet et al., of PRCV. The presence of 224 aa (from residue 21 to 244) in recombinant Ad-TS06, which are deleted in the 1994). Using Salmonella typhimurium, site D has been expressed and TGEV-neutralizing antibodies have been PRCV, might have been critical to achieve the observed protection. This interpretation is in agreement with the elicited in serum and in mucosal areas using live recombinant bacteria (Smerdou et al., 1995) but protection ex-partial protection seeing with the antiserum elicited in swine by recombinant Ad-TS8, which includes the se-periments using these systems have not been reported. Ad5 vectors have a high probability of inducing effective quences deleted in PRCV, but at the same time indicates that larger spike protein fragments (as those including mucosal immunity against TGEV, since this virus showed tropism for mucosal tissues in pigs, and the animals site A) are needed to elicite full protection.",
