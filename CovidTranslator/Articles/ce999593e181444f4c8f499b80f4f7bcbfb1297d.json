Human beings become infected through tick bites, by crushing infected ticks, after contact with a patient with CCHF during the acute phase of infection, or by contact with blood or tissues from viraemic livestock. Clinical features commonly show a dramatic progression characterised by haemorrhage, myalgia, and fever. The levels of liver enzymes, creatinine phosphokinase, and lactate dehydrogenase are raised, and bleeding markers are prolonged. Infection of the endothelium has a major pathogenic role. Besides direct infection of the endothelium, indirect damage by viral factors or virus-mediated host-derived soluble factors that cause endothelial activations and dysfunction are thought to occur. In diagnosis, enzyme-linked immunoassay and real-time reverse transcriptase PCR are used. Early diagnosis is critical for patient therapy and prevention of potential nosocomial infections. Supportive therapy is the most essential part of case management. Recent studies suggest that ribavirin is eff ective against CCHF, although defi nitive studies are not available. Healthcare workers have a serious risk of infection, particularly during care of patients with haemorrhages from the nose, mouth, gums, vagina, and injection sites. Simple barrier precautions have been reported to be eff ective.",

            "text": "Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a fatal viral infection described in parts of Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the middle east. 1,2 The virus belongs to the genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridae family and causes severe diseases in human beings, with a reported mortality rate of 3-30%. 2,3 The geographic range of CCHF virus is the most extensive one among the medically important tickborne viruses (fi gure 1). Human beings become infected through tick bites, by contact with a patient with CCHF during the acute phase of infection, or by contact with blood or tissues from viraemic livestock. 4 The clinical features show common dramatic progression characterised by haemorrhage, myalgia, and fever, with some diff erences among diff erent regions suggested but not well studied. Treatment with ribavirin has not yet been approved in many countries. However, there are reports that indicate the drug may be benefi cial. The widespread geographic distribution of CCHF virus, its ability to produce severe human disease with high mortality rates, and fears about its intentional use as a bioterrorism agent 5 make the virus an important human pathogen. Moreover, ecological complexity of vectorborne diseases, therapeutic controversy, and human-to-human transmission of a zoonotic infection make CCHF an interesting topic for research.",

The signs were presence of blood in the urine, rectum, gums, vomitus, sputum, and abdominal cavity. 1 The arthropod that caused the disease was said to be tough, small, related to a louse or tick, and normally parasitising a black bird. In the modern era, Crimean haemorrhagic fever was fi rst described as a clinical entity in 1944-45, when about 200 Soviet military personnel were infected while assisting peasants in Crimea in the wake of World War 2. 1,2 The virus was isolated from blood and tissues of patients using intracerebral inoculation of newborn white mice in 1967. 1,2 The virus responsible for Crimean haemorrhagic fever was later shown to be Review antigenically indistinguishable from Congo virus, isolated in 1956 from a febrile patient in Belgian Congo (present day Democratic Republic of the Congo). 10 The common antigenic structure among Eurasian Crimean haemorrhagic fever strains 11 and Asian 12 and African strains of Congo virus 9,13,14 led to the virus being called Crimean haemorrhagic fever-Congo virus, 15 and then Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus. 1",

            "text": "The geographic range of CCHF virus is the most extensive among the tickborne viruses that aff ect human health, and the second most widespread of all medically important arboviruses, after dengue viruses (fi gure 1). 2 The history of reported outbreaks is summarised in table 1. Before 1970, most cases were reported from the former Soviet Union (Crimea, Astrakhan, Rostov, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan) 1,2 and Bulgaria, 1,2 as well as virus circulation in parts of Africa such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda. 10,13 An outbreak in 1965 in China with a case fatality rate of 80% was noted, but not presented in detail. 33 The initial recognition of haemorrhagic cases in Africa occurred in the 1960s, resulting in a series of in-depth studies in South Africa [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] and reports of additional outbreaks from Congo, 43 Mauritania, 30 Burkina Faso, 45 Tanzania, 43 and Senegal. 46 A substantial number of cases were also reported from middle eastern countries such as Iraq, 25, 26 the United Arab Emirates (UAE), 23, 24, 47 Saudi Arabia 27 and Oman, 28 and from Pakistan 20 and China. 19 By 2000, new outbreaks had been reported from Pakistan, 21, 22, 48 Iran, 29 Senegal, 49 Albania, 17 Yugoslavia, 18, 50 Bulgaria, 16 Turkey, 3,6,7 Kenya, 32 and Mauritania. 51 Serological evidence for CCHF virus has been reported from Greece, 31 India, 52 Egypt, 53 Portugal, 54 Hungary, 55 France, 1 and Benin, 1 although the virus was isolated only in Greece and the only reported human case was a Greek laboratory infection. CCHF virus is endemic in the Balkans, including Bulgaria, 16 the former Yugoslavia, 18, 50 and Albania. 17 It is of interest that the strain that caused the laboratory-related infection in Greece was exceedingly mild, possibly refl ecting chance variation; however, the virus has the greatest phylogenetic diff erence from other CCHF viruses and Greece is separated from Bulgaria by mountains approximately 1500-2500 m high. 16 The microbiology and the life cycle of the virus CCHF is a member of the Nairovirus genus of the family Bunyaviridae. Other genera within the family include Orthobunyavirus, Hantavirus, Phlebovirus, and Tospovirus. The Nairovirus genus includes 34 described viruses and is divided into seven diff erent serogroups. 56 The most important groups are the CCHF group, which includes CCHF virus and Hazara virus, and the Nairobi sheep disease group, which includes the Nairobi sheep disease and Dugbe viruses. 4 CCHF virus, Dugbe virus, and Nairobi sheep disease virus are the only three members of the Nairovirus genus that are known to cause disease among human beings.",

The viral glycoproteins are responsible for the recognition of receptor sites on susceptible cells. Following attachment, viruses are internalised by endocytosis. 4 Replication occurs in the cytoplasm, and the virions mature by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum into cytoplasmic vesicles in the Golgi region. 4 Bunyaviruses are known to bud from Golgi membranes and the budding site seems to be defi ned by retention of the glycoproteins GN and GC at that particular site. 59 GN is localised to the Golgi compartment, whereas GC is found in the endoplasmic reticulum. 59 Recently, the expression strategy and biosynthesis of the CCHF viral glycoproteins have been studied in more detail, including the identifi cation of precursor cleavage sites and the determination of the exact amino termini of the two major cleavage products, GN and GC. 60 The subtilase SKI-1 has been identifi ed as the cellular protease responsible for the processing step that generates the amino terminus of mature GN. 61, 62 Recent studies of the L RNA genome segment and predicted encoded L polymerase protein of CCHF virus demonstrate that they are approximately twice the size of those found in viruses of other bunyavirus genera. Regions containing ovarian tumour-like cysteine protease and helicase domains were identifi ed in the L segments of CCHF and Dugbe viruses, suggesting an autoproteolytic cleavage process for nairovirus L proteins. 63, 64 Phylogenetic studies and worldwide diversity",

However, the development of nucleic acid sequence analysis techniques revealed extensive genetic diversity. Most nucleic acid sequence analyses are based on the S segment of the genome, although some recent studies were done on the M RNA segment. According to these studies, there are eight genetically distinct clades. 15 Because of their low genetic divergence, the European strains are grouped together, except the Greek strain AP92. 16, 17 The strains from southeast Russia are closely related to the European strains. 62, 65 Turkish CCHF virus isolates from the recent outbreak are clustered closely with CCHF viral strains from southwest Russia and Kosovo. Bootstrap analysis showed the clade containing the Russian, Balkan, and Turkish CCHF viruses to be well supported (99%), and these viruses are clearly distinct from those in other virus clades, including the clade containing the virus detected in the CCHF outbreak in neighbouring Iran in 2002. 6 The AP92 strain, isolated from Rhipicephalus bursa ticks from Greece, diff ers from European strains 66 and forms an independent clade. This genetic diff erence may be attributable to the diff erent species of ticks vector and/ or to genetic isolation by adjacent mountain ranges. 16 The third clade is formed from the strains from central Asia-namely Kazahkstan, 67 Tajikistan, 68 Uzbekistan, 68 and China 68 -which are closely related. Phylogenetic analysis of the M segment showed that the Chinese CCHF virus isolates were clustered into three groups, one of which was more closely related to a Nigerian isolate. 69 Isolates from Iran, Madagascar, and Pakistan were found to be closely related, forming a fourth clade. 16 Partial S-segment nucleotide sequences showed that the Iranian viral isolates clustered along with strains from Pakistan and Madagascar in one distinct lineage. 70 Phylogenetic analysis also demonstrated that the Iranian isolates examined in this study and the CCHF virus strain ArTeh193-3 clustered into diff erent genetic groups, indicating that at least two genetic lineages of CCHF virus could be co-circulating in Iran. 70 The second group of strains from Iran is closely related to strains from Senegal and Mauritania, which together form a fi fth clade. 16 Finally, there are three distinct clades in Africa: fi rst, strains from Senegal, Mauritania, and South Africa; second, strains from Nigeria and Central African Republic; and third, strains from Uganda.",

CCHF virus was isolated from adult Hyalomma genus ticks in the 1960s. 1,2 Viral isolates were also obtained from fi eld-collected eggs and unfed immature stages of H marginatum, providing evidence of transovarial (ie, from infected mother to egg stage), and transstadial (ie, from larvae to nymph to adult) transmissions. 2 The known occurrence of CCHF in Europe, Asia, and Africa coincides with the global distribution of hyalomma ticks. 1,2 H marginatum marginatum is known as the Mediterranean hyalomma, and it may be the main vector of CCHF virus in Europe. CCHF virus has also been isolated from Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum and other Hyalomma spp. Isolates from other tick generaeg, Rhipicephalus, Ornithodoros, Boophilus, Dermacentor, and Ixodes spp 1,2 -may be locally important because some have transmitted virus in the laboratory, but viral isolation alone does not incriminate them as vectors without additional laboratory and epidemiological studies. 2",

            "text": "Changes in climatic conditions have been suggested to be one of the factors that has facilitated reproduction of the tick population, and consequently the increased incidence of tick-borne infectious diseases. 72, 73 In the northern hemisphere, H marginatum marginatum is usually activated by increasing temperature in the spring, particularly in April or May, and the immature stages are active in the summer between May and September. 74 For example, in the Ukrainian steppes in 1963-64, the fi rst adult hyalommas appeared when average daily temperatures reached 5-9\u00b0C on April 8 in 1963, and April 20 the following year. 1 Tick densities were reduced by the severe winter of 1968-69 in Astrakhan Oblast (a federal republic of Russia), and consequently the number of the cases of CCHF was drastically reduced. 1 The number of days with a temperature of over 5\u00b0C in April, and the daily mean temperature in April in the region of Turkey aff ected by the recent outbreak were reported to be increased in the years before the outbreak. 75 However, climate change is not necessarily the cause of the marked increased incidence of a variety of tick-borne diseases in many parts of Europe over the past two decades. 76 In general, CCHF outbreaks have developed against a background of favourable climatic factors and environmental changes benefi cial for the survival of large numbers of Hyalomma spp ticks and of the hosts of both their immature and adult stages. 1 In the former Soviet Union, environmental changes include wartime neglect of agricultural lands, introduction of susceptible military personnel or new settlers into an infected area, wide scale collectivisation of agriculture, changing pasture patterns, converting fl oodplains to farmland, and fl ood control. 1 During World War 2, after the occupation of Crimea (1941-44), normal agricultural activities were disrupted and the common sport of hunting European hares was abandoned. When Soviet troops reoccupied the hilly Crimean steppes in 1944, hares had become excessively abundant and neglected pastures were overgrown with weeds, and the fi rst outbreak of the modern era was documented. 1 Interestingly, a similar explanation was suggested for the outbreak in Turkey: 75 the fi elds in the aff ected region had been abandoned from hunting and pasturing between 1995 and 2001 because of terrorist activities in the region; in this period, the numbers of small mammals (eg, hares) and wild animals (eg, boars) increased. After 2001, the fi elds became available again for hunting and pasturing, and cattle and sheep were exposed to virus-carrying ticks.",

In South Africa, the time to onset of disease after exposure to tick bite was 3\u00b72 days, 5 days following exposure to blood or tissue of livestock, and 5\u00b76 days after exposure to blood of infected human beings. 43 The mean duration of the disease course before presenting at a hospital was reported to be 5\u00b75 days in Turkey 3 and 3\u00b75 days in the UAE. 24 The prehaemorrhagic period is characterised by the sudden onset of fever (39-41\u00baC), headache, myalgia, and dizziness. 1-4,6,7,24,44 On average, fever persists for 4-5 days. 1 Additional symptoms of diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting are also seen in some cases. 2,24,44 Hyperaemia of the face, neck, and chest, congested sclera, and conjunctivitis are commonly noted. The prehaemorrhagic period lasts an average of 3 days (range: 1-7 days). 1 The haemorrhagic period is short (usually 2-3 days), develops rapidly, and usually begins between the third to fi fth day of disease. There is no relation between the temperature of the feverish patient and onset of haemorrhage. 1 Haemorrhagic manifestations range from petechiae to large haematomas appearing on the mucous membranes and skin (fi gure 4). Bleeding from other sites, including the vagina, gingival bleeding, and cerebral haemorrhage have been reported. 43 The most common bleeding sites are the nose, gastrointestinal system (haematemesis, melena, and intra-abdominal), uterus (menometrorrhagia) and urinary tract (haematuria), and Review the respiratory tract (haemoptysis). 2,85 Atypical presentations of bleeding are also seen. For example, in one patient with stubborn abdominal pain, acute appendicitis was suspected, but haemorrhage and bleeding in the internal and external oblique muscles and caecum were detected, with no pathology of the appendix. 86 Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly have been reported to be occur in one-third of patients. 1 In Turkey, hepatomegaly was detected in 20-40% of cases, 3,6-8 and two studies reported splenomegaly, with frequencies of 14% and 23%. 7,8 The convalescence period begins in survivors about 10-20 days after the onset of illness. Patients remain in hospital for around 9-10 days. 3, 24 In the convalescent period, labile pulse, tachycardia, temporary complete loss of hair, polyneuritis, diffi culty in breathing, xerostomia, poor vision, loss of hearing, and loss of memory have been reported, 1 although none of these fi ndings were noted in the recent outbreak in Turkey.

A newly identifi ed molecule known as MxA, which is a member of the interferon-induced GTPases that belong to the dynamin superfamily, prevented the replication of CCHF viral RNA when present intracellularly, 110 and inhibited the production of new infectious virus particles by interacting with a component of the nucleocapsid.",

Simple barrier precautions have been reported to be eff ective. 111 Strict adherence to universal barrier precautions in hospitals in Turkey during the recent outbreak meant that no antibodies against CCHF virus were found in at-risk health-care workers when serologically screened after the outbreak. 112 In a recent study, prophylactic ribavirin was administered to a health-care worker who had a needlestick injury. The health-care worker did not subsequently develop CCHF. 22 The administration of oral ribavirin prophylaxis was off ered to anyone at high risk of infection, such as those who were directly exposed to the blood of CCHF patients through contact or needlestick injury. However, rigorous daily follow-up of any such individual by checking white blood cell counts and biochemical tests for at least 14 days after the exposure should be suffi cient; ribavirin should only be administered if fever develops.",
