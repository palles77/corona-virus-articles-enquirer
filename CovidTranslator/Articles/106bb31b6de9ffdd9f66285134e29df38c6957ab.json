Each year, an estimated 500,000 bacterial pneumonia-related hospitalizations and 40,000 deaths occur in the United States (4, 5) . Acute respiratory infections are caused by a wide range of microorganisms (1, 2) . Clinically, it is difficult to make a distinction between causative infectious agents, and conventional diagnosis is usually based on microbial culture. Culture techniques are time-consuming, and some pathogens like Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae are very difficult to culture. Also, Streptococcus pneumoniae can be cultured from the upper respiratory tract for as many as 68% of children and 15% of adults in the absence of respiratory disease (8) . In addition, individuals with pneumococcal infections who are receiving antibiotics can have negative culture results (10) . Thus, a variety of other diagnostic methods including antigen testing and PCR applied to different clinical specimens such as urine, blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, transthoracic needle aspirates, and nasopharyngeal (NP) and oropharyngeal swabs have been used to define both invasive and noninvasive respiratory infections (12, 15, 16) .",

Nucleic acid extracts from such specimens are limited in volume and therefore the number of assays that can be performed for various pathogens are limited. Real-time PCR assays are generally rapid, sensitive, and specific. Multiplex PCR assays could be useful for the rapid and simultaneous detection of coinfection of respiratory bacteria in a specimen without additional cost or processing. However, multiplex PCR is still challenging because amplification conditions for multiple targets are often incompatible and the high concentration of primers typically yields elevated background readings and reduced amplification efficiency. Target-enriched multiplex PCR addresses these issues via application of liquid-phase bead-based array (Luminex xMAP) technology.",

It is not intended for clinical diagnostic use. The assay amplifies and detects gene-specific DNA sequences of six respiratory bacterial pathogens: S. pneumoniae (lytA), Neisseria meningitidis (ctrA), encapsulated or nonencapsulated Haemophilus influenzae (bexA, ompP2), L. pneumophila (mip), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (ATPase), and C. pneumoniae (ompA) (4, 6, 9, 11, 13, 17, 18) . The objective of this study was to design the ResPlex I assay using modifications of CDC real-time PCR primers and probes to C. pneumoniae, L. pneumophila, M. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis, and S. pneumoniae and examine the application of this assay for the detection of bacteria associated with respiratory infections. Analytical specificity and the limit of detection of the ResPlex I assay were determined and the assay was compared with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time PCR for its ability to detect these specimens in NP swabs and FFPE tissues.",

A notemplate control sample was included by adding 5 l of water in place of the DNA sample volume. Samples were amplified in a thermocycler under the following conditions: initial PCR activation, 95\u00b0C for 15 min; enrichment cycling, 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 52\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min (15 cycles); two-step cycling, 94\u00b0C for 15 s and 70\u00b0C for 1.5 min (6 cycles); three-step cycling, 94\u00b0C for 15 s, 52\u00b0C for 15 s, and 72\u00b0C for 15 s (30 cycles); and final extension, 72\u00b0C for 3 min.

The ResPlex I bead mix was resuspended by vortexing for at least 20 seconds. Forty-five microliters of the hybridization master mix was prepared by mixing 35 l of hybridization buffer with 10 l of ResPlex I bead mix and dispensed into each well. Five microliters of PCR product was added and mixed thoroughly. Samples were hybridized at 52\u00b0C for 10 min. After hybridization, 10 l of streptavidin-phycoerythrin diluted in detection buffer was added to each sample. Samples were mixed briefly and incubated at 52\u00b0C for 5 min. The reactions were stopped by adding 120 l of stopping buffer prewarmed at 52\u00b0C. Samples were analyzed at 52\u00b0C on a Luminex 100 following the manufacturer's instructions.

The need for rapid assays is highlighted by events such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak and the threat of pandemic influenza. A variety of strategies have been advanced to combine nucleic acid amplification assays. Many of these suffer from the consequences of incompatible primer sets and nonspecific reactions (3) . The ResPlex I assay attempts to overcome these problems by use of nested primers for each target along with \"super primers\" which are used at higher concentrations later in the PCR.

In addition, some encapsulated H. influenzae strains may not react with both probes. The ResPlex I assay was less sensitive in detecting respiratory pathogens on NP swabs, as shown in Table 3 , detecting 50% of the samples positive for C. pneumoniae, 59% of those positive for M. pneumoniae, and 81% of those positive for S. pneumoniae. This study is biased in favor of the real-time PCR assays, since many of the specimens were selected based upon the fact that they were positive by these assays. The somewhat lower sensitivity of the ResPlex I assay may be compensated for by its overall efficiency as a multiplexed assay that can detect multiple pathogens from a single specimen.
