Specimens positive for KIPyV or WUPyV were tested for adenoviruses; human bocavirus; human rhinoviruses; human metapneumovirus; human coronaviruses OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1; and human PyVs BK and JC by using PCR methods (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) . Total nucleic acid was extracted from 200 \u03bcL of NA, BAL, or stool specimens by using the EasyMag System (bio-M\u00e9rieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). KIPyV was detected with an in-house real-time PCR assay targeting the VP1 gene. The primers and hydrolysis probe were designed by using Primer Express 3.0 software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The fi nal reaction volume was 25 \u03bcL and contained 12.5 pmol of SLKI-VP1s (5\u2032-GGAAATACAGCTGCTCAGGAT-3\u2032) and SLKI-VP1as (5\u2032-CTTTGATACTTGAACCGCTTTCCTT-3\u2032), 6.25 pmol of corresponding probe SLKI-VP1PR (5\u2032-6FAM-C GTGACCCCACCCCTCATTACTGGTC-TAMRA-3\u2032), 12.5 \u03bcL of TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), and 5 \u03bcL of DNA extract. The reaction was run on a 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems). The specifi city of positive specimens was confi rmed by using PCR and nested PCR with primers POLVP1-39F/POLVP1-363R and POLVP1-118F/POLVP1-324R, as described (1) . The PCR products were then sequenced and compared with the previously described sequences from Sweden and Australia (GenBank accession nos. EF127906, EF127907, EF127908, EF520287, EF520288, and EF520289). WUPyV was detected by PCR as described (3) . PCR products with the expected molecular weights were sequenced by using primers AG0044 and AG0045 and compared to published sequences (GenBank accession nos.

Results from previous reports suggest a similar frequency of both KIPyV and WUPyV infections being found in respiratory specimens, ranging from 1% to 3%. In contrast, in our series, we found a likely difference between the prevalence of KIPyV (8%) and WUPyV (1%), which suggests that the replication or reactivation of the 2 viruses in the respiratory tract may differ between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients. However, this difference requires further investigation, in particular, by using similar real-time PCR assays. Notably, a significantly higher prevalence of KIPyV infection was found among HSCT patients, which suggests that a profound T-cell defi ciency may be a factor in facilitating KIPyV replication.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the seemingly higher frequency of KIP-yV shedding in immunocompromised patients (as observed with other PyVs) and the detection of KIPyV as a single pathogen in respiratory disease (e.g., as cytomegalovirus recurrence can lead to pneumonia in immunocompromised patients) together support a reactivation hypothesis. Nevertheless, a reinfection hypothesis cannot be excluded due to immunocompromised patients' increased risk of acquiring viral infection from exogenous sources Controlled prospective studies of KIPyV shedding before and during immunosuppression will help determine the pathogenic role of this virus. The clinical implication of KIPyV detection in stools and the mechanisms underlying the concomitant presence in gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts also deserve further analysis.",
