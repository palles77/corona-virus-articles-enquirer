            "text": "Cellular immune mechanisms that regulate viral gene expression within infected brain cells remain poorly understood. Previous work has shown that systemic immunization against adenovirus after vector delivery to the brain results in complete loss of brain cells infected by adenoviral vectors. Although T cells play an important role in this process, we demonstrate herein that B cells also significantly regulate transgene expression from the CNS. After the systemic immunization against adenovirus of animals injected via the brain with an adenoviral vector 30 days earlier, we uncovered substantial infiltration by CD19 + B cells of the area of the brain transduced by the virus. This suggests the involvement of B cells in the adaptive immune response-mediated loss of transduced cells from the brain. Confocal analysis of these brains demonstrated physical contacts between transduced brain cells and CD19 + cells. To test the hypothesis that B cells play a causal role in the loss of infected cells from the brain, we demonstrated that animals devoid of B cells were unable to eliminate transgene expression at early time points after immunization. This demonstrates that B cells play a necessary role in the loss of transgene expression at early, but not late, time points postimmunization. Thus, these data have important implications for our understanding of the role of B cells as immune effectors during the immune-mediated clearance of viral infections from the CNS, and also for understanding mechanisms operating in brain autoimmunity, as well as for the potential safety of clinical gene therapy for brain diseases.",

However, priming of the systemic host immune system against any antigens present within viral vectors, and including the marker transgene or therapeutic transgene, generates an immune response that causes brain inflammation and in some cases destruction of infected cells (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Although when used as tumor immunotherapy the immune response to viral vectors may be acceptable or even desirable, deleterious immune responses have halted various clinical trials (16) (17) (18) . The long-term viability of clinical gene therapy for the treatment of neurological diseases therefore depends on approaches that will not elicit significant immune-mediated attack of transduced cells. How immune mechanisms detect and respond to viral vectors in the brain needs to be understood to predict and control untoward and deleterious immune responses. This implies a comprehensive understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the immune system detects and eventually eliminates exogenous DNA sequences and proteins introduced into the CNS is thus needed. This in turn will allow the design of safer, less toxic, and nonimmunogenic vectors.",

Although the presence of immune cells in the central nervous system (CNS) or of antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is usually associated with disease states in which the blood-brain barrier (BBB) has been compromised, activated B cells, or activated T cells, are capable of entering the brain parenchyma (20) .",

However, it has been more recently shown by Cserr and Knopf that intrathecal antibody synthesis in response to soluble antigens, such as ovalbumin, within the brain can be elicited in healthy animals with normal, noncompromised BBB permeability (22) . Thus, brain immune reactivity depends essentially on two factors. One, whether antigens are injected selectively into the brain parenchyma (does not prime a systemic immune response), or into the brain ventricles (does prime a systemic immune response), and whether the antigen injected is particulate and will thus remain restricted to the injection site in the brain parenchyma (and will not prime a systemic immune response), or can diffuse and eventually reach the brain ventricular system (and prime a systemic immune response) [reviewed in (23) (24) (25) (26) ].",

Systemic immunization is necessary because priming does not occur after the careful delivery of adenovirus, or other viruses, or infectious particulate antigens, directly into the brain parenchyma (23, 25, (32) (33) (34) . C57BL/6 mice were initially injected via the striatum with 0.5 \u03bcL of PBS containing 1 \u00d7 10 7 IU of RAd-TK. Thirty days after the striatal injection, control animals were perfused-fixed and experimental animals were immunized systemically with RAd-HPRT. Systemic immunization was conducted with RAd-HPRT to study immune responses against adenovirus, without taking into account any existing immune responses against the transgenes, which were mismatched. At 14 and 30 days postimmunization animals were perfused-fixed, and 50\u03bcm-thick serial brain sections were cut on a Vibratome to examine the influx into the brain of B cells at early times postimmunization. Immunofluorescence analysis was performed on free-floating sections, and confocal microscopy was used to determine the presence of immune cells infiltrating the area of the brain containing infected cells. These studies demonstrated infiltration of CD19 + cells exclusively into areas of the brain that contained infected cells expressing the TK marker gene (Fig. 1A-F) . Stereological quantification of CD19 + cells in the CNS of these animals demonstrated that virtually no CD19 + cells were present in the brains of control animals (0 days) that were not immunized with RAd-HPRT; however, statistically significant numbers of CD19 + cells had infiltrated the brains of experimental groups after initiation of an adaptive immune response by immunization with RAd-HPRT at 14 and 30 days after immunization (Fig. 1G) .",

Contacts were defined as close apposition, in at least two consecutive 0.5-\u03bcm optical confocal sections, of a transduced cell (TK-immunoreactive) and an immune cell (CD19-immunoreactive). No infiltrating CD19 + cells, or contacts with transduced cells, were detected in nonimmunized animals (0 days). Quantification included the percentage of CD19 + cells contacting transduced cells, the percentage of transduced cells with CD19 + cell contacts, and the average number of CD19 + cells per transduced cell ( Fig.  2A-C) . The quantitative analysis indicates that >25% of CD19 + cells contacted infected cells, and that in turn a minority of infected cells was contacted by CD19 + cells. Thus, although direct contacts exist, the majority of B cells infiltrating the brain region containing infected cells do not establish direct anatomical contacts with infected cells. Confocal microscopy analysis illustrates the specific contacts between CD19 + cells and TK-transduced cells (Fig. 2D , projection image; Fig. 2E , 0.5-\u03bcm confocal layer). These data suggest that effects of B cells on infected cells may be a result of direct contact with infected cells, or result from the release of particular mediators, or from the capacity of B cells to recruit other effectors into the brain through their function as antigen-presenting cells.",

All Igh-6 + /+ transgenic mice were on the C57BL/6 background. After intrastriatal injection of RAd-TK, evidence of TK-transduced cells could be seen in nonimmunized control and immunized Igh-6 + /+ mice at all time points analyzed (Fig. 3A) . However, unbiased stereological quantification of transduced cells in the brains of control and RAd-HPRT-immunized animals demonstrated no significant loss of transduced cells at 30 days postimmunization, but a significant loss of transduced cells at 60, 90, and 120 days postimmunization (Fig. 3B) . However, in control C57BL/6 animals that were immunized against adeno virus transgene, expression had already been eliminated by day 30 postimmunization (Fig. 3C) (and remained at low levels for up to 1 year; data not shown). In control C57BL/6 animals that were sham immunized, transgene expression levels remained stable (Fig. 3D) . Thus, the elimination of transgene-expressing cells was significantly delayed in Igh-6 + /+ mice. This suggests that B cells play an important role in the early phase of elimination of transgene expression in the brain, but are not necessary for the sustained longterm loss of infected cells from the brain (Fig. 3B ).",

Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which the immune system regulates transgene expression from virally infected brain cells is crucial for understanding how the immune system regulates expression from viral genomes that infect the CNS. Here we examine expression of a marker gene encoded by a viral vector as a model to elucidate the mechanisms eventually leading to the inhibition of viral gene expression and viral clearance from the CNS. We also believe this work will contribute to enhancing the efficacy of clinical trials in neurological gene therapy that use viral vectors as therapeutic tools, and thus rely on continued expression from the viral vectors, eventually even in the presence of immune responses (8) (9) (10) 13, (35) (36) (37) . Using a mouse model of brain immune responses to adenoviruses, we have previously demonstrated that CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are involved in the elimination of transgene expression from the brain through a combination of cytotoxic and noncytotoxic regulatory mechanisms, and that this response occurs whether animals are exposed systemically to virus before or after the delivery of viral vectors to the brain.",

Examination of the influx of B cells into the CNS was performed by immunohistochemistry, using immunoreactivity for CD19 as a marker of B cells within the brain. Quantification of immunohistochemistry showed that few CD19 + cells are present in the normal naive brain before systemic activation of the adaptive immune response by RAd-HPRT immunization, but B cells will infiltrate only those areas of the brain containing infected cells. Stereological quantification detected CD19-immunoreactive B cells within the CNS 14 days after immunization and these cells were still present 30 days after immunization. Analysis by flow cytometry, using a CD45R/B220 antibody, which is also expressed on some activated T and natural killer (NK) cells (41) , as well as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (42) , confirmed that cells expressing B cell antigens are able to infiltrate the CNS after systemic anti-adenoviral immunization. An increase in the number of CD45R/B220 + cells was detected in the CNS of Rad-HPRT-immunized mice 14 days after immunization (data not shown).",

Quantification of such contacts revealed that specific contacts exist between CD19 + B cells and transduced cells in the brains of mice only after immunization with RAd-HPRT, indicating that the adaptive immune system must be activated in order for CD19 + cells to enter the brain and engage infected cells. Only a minority (approximately 15-20%) of infiltrating CD19 + cells had established contacts with transduced cells by 14 and 30 days after immunization, and even fewer transduced cells (approximately 10-15%) were contacted by these same CD19 + cells. However, the small number of CD19 + cells that infiltrate and the absence of contacts in control animals indicate that immunization against viral vectors and the induction of an adaptive immune response are able to induce B cell infiltration into the CNS, resulting in specific contacts between immune cells and transduced cells. Whether individual B cells can contact various infected cells over time remains to be determined, using in vivo imaging technologies.",

Our unpublished data have shown that transgene expression in the brain from first-generation vectors is nearly abolished in C57BL/6 mice by 30 days after immunization, and remains low for up to 1 year later. We also demonstrated that T cells are involved in the elimination of transgene expression from the brain, as CD4 + /+ and CD8 + /+ transgenic animals were unable to clear transgene expression after immunization. Use of Igh-6 + /+ animals, devoid of B cells, demonstrates that there are still significant numbers of transduced cells in the brain 30 days postimmunization, a time point at which transgene expression is nearly eliminated in immunized C57BL/6 animals. However, at the 60-day postimmunization time point, there is a significant decrease in the number of transduced cells, indicating that the role of B cells may be functionally necessary only at early stages of the adaptive immune response. This indicates that B cells play a role in the early elimination of transgene expression from the infected brain, but do play lesser or no roles in the elimination of transgene expression from viral vectors that occurs at the later time points.",

One of the possibilities is that B cells, circulating in the blood and lymph under normal conditions, are also circulating through the CSF. On peripheral exposure to adenovirus and induction of an adaptive immune response B cells specific for adenoviral antigens are able to migrate to the site of previous adenoviral infection in the CNS and act as an antigenpresenting cell. The phenomenon of B cell trafficking to the brain in rats infused with antigen has been described previously (43) for resting B cells in brain studies of immune tolerance (44, 45) . Activation of B cells has also led to the induction of chemokine genes, leading to the recruitment of regulatory cells (46) . As such, B cells could act by facilitating the entry of other immune effectors into the brain, and their role would be taken up by different antigenpresenting cells at later time points. This would explain the delay in the elimination of transgene expression in B cell-deficient animals.",

Together with a significant delay in the elimination of transgene expression from the brains of mice deficient in B cells, these data provide conclusive evidence that B cells access the brain as part of the systemic immune response, do recognize the presence of infected cells within the brain, and significantly contribute to their elimination. The molecular mechanisms by which B cells do so remain to be explored in further detail. quantification of TK-immunoreactive cells in the striatum of C57BL/6 mice 120 days after sham immunization, showing continued transgene expression in the absence of immunization.",

This demonstrates that a minority (up to 20%) of CD19 + cells contact transduced cells; only 10% of transduced cells are contacted by a CD19 + cell; and on average only one CD19 + cell will contact a target transduced cell.
