Rep. 6, 25754). This study investigated the correlation of PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21 with the expression of Type I collagen in human lung epithelial cells and mouse pulmonary tissues. Specific inhibitors for TGF-\u03b2RI, p38 MAPK, MEK, and STAT3 proved that SARS-CoV PLpro induced TGF-\u03b21-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen in vitro and in vivo. Subcellular localization analysis of SMAD3 and SMAD7 indicated that non-SMAD pathways in TGF-\u03b21 signaling involved in the production of Type I collagen in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro. Comprehensive analysis of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins using immunoprecipitation and nanoLC-MS/MS indicated that SARS-CoV PLpro caused the change in the ubiquitination profile of Rho GTPase family proteins, in which linked with the increase of Rho-like GTPase family proteins. Moreover, selective inhibitors TGF-\u03b2RI and STAT6 (AS1517499) ascertained that STAT6 activation was required for PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen in human lung epithelial cells. The results showed that SARS-CoV PLpro stimulated TGF-\u03b21-dependent expression of Type I collagen via activating STAT6 pathway.",

The largest ORFs ORF1a and ORF1ab encode for the polyprotein replicases 1a and 1ab mainly involving in the SARS-CoV replication, as cleaved in cis and in trans by ORF1a-encoded papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like protease (3CLpro). PLpro, a de-ubiquitinating/de-ISGylating enzyme (Barretto et al., 2005; Ratia et al., 2006) , has the antagonistic activities of Type I interferon (IFN) via blocking IRF-3 and ERK1 phosphorylation, preventing the I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation, and de-ubiquitinating the STING-TRAF3-TBK1 complex (Li et al., 2011; Frieman et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012) . Recently, PLpro shows the inhibitory effect on Tolllike receptor 7 (TLR7) mediated cytokine production through removing Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains of TRAF3 and TRAF6 (Li et al., 2016a) .",

In the canonical Smad signalling pathway, TGF-\u03b21 interacts with the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor, activates receptorregulated Smads (Smad2 and Smad3) complexed with Smad4, and then translocate to the nucleus to synthesize TGF-\u03b21-induced transcriptional genes like Type I collagen (Leask and Abraham, 2004; Kubiczkova et al., 2012) . In non-canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways, TGF-\u03b21 activates MAPKs (Erk, JNK and p38 MAPK), Rho-like GTPases (RhoA, Rac and Cdc42), PI3K/AKT, WNT/\u03b2-catenin, or Ca 2+ signaling cascades in TGF-\u03b21-induced transcriptional response (Zhang, 2009 ). The activation of p38 MAPK is responsible for TGF-\u03b2-induced epithelial-tomesenchymal transition of mouse mammary gland epithelial cells under a receptor independent of receptor-mediated Smad activation (Yu et al., 2002) . The activation of RhoA in TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT response is also independent of Smad2 and/or Smad3 (Bhowmick et al., 2001) .",

This study assesses possible effects and mechanisms of SARS-CoV PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21 upregulation on the expression of Type I collagen. The induction ability of SARS-CoV PLpro on in vitro and in vivo expression of Type I collagen was characterized. In addition, subcellular localization of Smad3, Smad7, and STAT6 was performed to elucidate the key factors involved in the induction of Type I collagen by PLpro. The relationship between TGF-\u03b2 upregulation and the mechanism of Type I collagen induction by PLpro was validated by the specific inhibitors of TGF-\u03b2 receptor kinase, p38 MAPK and STAT6.",

Importantly, PLpro(H273A) with the catalytic mutation lose the ability to induce the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and type I collagen in vitro. Since SARS-PLpro had been demonstrated to stimulate p38 MAPK/STAT3mediated activation of TGF-\u03b21 production (Li et al., 2016b) , SB203580 (a specific p38-MAPKs inhibitor), U0126 (a MEK1/2 inhibitor), and Stattic (a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3 activation) were used to further confirm the correlation between the TGF-\u03b21 production and Type I collagen up-regulation in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro and pcDNA3.1 (Fig. 3B-D) . SB203580 significantly reduced the mRNA expression of TGF-\u03b21, in which was linked with down-regulation of Type I collagen in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro in presence of SB203580 or U0126 ( Fig. 3B and C) . Stattic also suppressed the mRNA expression of Type I collagen in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro ( Fig. 3D) .

            "text": "To examine whether SMAD-dependent pathways involve in TGF-\u03b21mediated up-regulation of Type I collagen in response SARS-CoV PLpro, subcellular localization of receptor-regulated SMAD3 and inhibitory SMAD7 in transfected cells were detected using the immunofluorescent and DAPI staining (Fig. 4) . Imaging analysis of transfected cells indicated that SMAD3 localized in the nucleus of pcDNA3.1-transfected cells, but not pSARS-PLpro-transfected cells (Fig. 4A) . Moreover, SMAD7 was detected in the nucleus of both transfected cells (Fig. 4B) . Interestingly, kartogenin, a stimulator for TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 signal pathway , was used to verify the inhibitory effect of PLpro on TGF-\u03b21/Smad3 signal in transfected cells (Fig. 4C) . After 24 h treatment with kartogenin, Samd3 nuclear translocation was spotted within the nucleus in vector control cells, but not in PLproexpressing cells. Most Samd3 was in the cytoplasm of pSARS-PLpro transfected cells treated with kartogenin. The result indicated that SARS-CoV PLpro inactivated SMAD-dependent pathways, implying that non-SMAD pathways in TGF-\u03b21signaling for the production of Type I collagen would be initiated by SARS-CoV PLpro. Non-Smad pathways in TGF-\u03b21 signaling include MAP kinase, Rholike GTPase, and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT pathways (Zhang, 2009) . To examine the possible pathways involved in TGF-\u03b21-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen by SARS-CoV PLpro, the profiles of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins in transfected cells with vector control and pSARS-PLpro were determined using immune-precipitation and nanoLC-MS/MS. Interestingly, several proteins of the Ras GTPase family were identified (Table 1 ), in which indicated the ubiquitination of these Ras family GTPase proteins was influenced by SARS-CoV PLpro. Fig. 5A represented the mass spectrum of Rac1 identified by LC-MS/MS. Rac1, a Rho GTPase, had an increase of the ubiquitination in PLpro-expressing cells compared to vector control cells. Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting assays revealed the elevation of Rac1 mRNA and protein expression in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control ( Fig. 5B and C) . Rho GTPases were identified in the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor signaling through activation of Jak/STAT and modulated STAT-dependent gene expression (Pelletier et al., 2003) . In addition, STAT-6-dependent collagen production has been demonstrated in human skin fibroblasts and mouse airway fibroblasts in response to bovine milk and platelet-derived growth factor, respectively (Kippenberger et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2014) . For analyzing the correlation between PLpro-induced Rac1 upregulation and STAT6 activation, co-transfection of pcDNA3.1 or pSARS-PLpro plus the Rac1 mutant plasmid pMX-IG-Rac1 T17N was performed, and the STAT6 activation in co-transfected cells was measured using immunofluorescence staining with anti-STAT6 and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. PLpro expression caused the STAT6 expression and induced the translation of STAT6 in the nucleus. Remarkably, the Rac1 mutant slightly affected the STAT6 up-regulation by PLpro, but significantly reduced PLpro-induced STAT6 nuclear translocation (Fig. 5D) . Later, the functional activity of STAT6 in TGF-\u03b21-dependent collagen up-regulation was further characterized in vector control and PLpro-expressing cells (Figs. 6 and 7) . Nuclear localization and phosphorylation of STAT6 was observed in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro, but not vector control cells (Figs. 6 and 7 A) . Importantly, SB-431542, a selective TGF-\u03b2R inhibitor, significantly reduced the entry of STAT6 in the nucleus of PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 6) . The result indicated that Rho GTPases/STAT6 was responsible for one of non-SMAD pathways in SARS PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21 signals. Furthermore, a STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 markedly suppressed TGF-\u03b21-dependent collagen expression in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7) . The results demonstrated that STAT6 activation was required for SARS PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21-dependent production of Type I collagen.",

            "text": "In canonical pathway, TGF-\u03b21interacts with type I and II TGF-\u03b2 receptors and causes the activation of a serine/threonine kinase domain in TGF-\u03b2 receptors and the recruitment and phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3. The phosphorylated SMAD2/3 complexed with SMAD4 was trans-localized into nucleus to regulate the target gene expression (Kubiczkova et al., 2012) . Subcellular localization analysis demonstrated that SMAD3 was predominant in cytoplasmic, but not in the nucleus in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control (Fig. 4) , revealing that canonical Smad-dependent signaling pathway was not involved in PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21-dependent upregulation of Type I collagen. TGF-\u03b2 also activates non-canonical non-SMAD pathways, including MAPKs (ERK1/ERK2, JNK and p38), PI3K kinases, AKT/PKB, mTOR, and Rho-like GTPase family proteins (Ras, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) (Zhang, 2009; Kubiczkova et al., 2012) . Particularly, activation of RhoA pathway was required for TGF-\u03b2mediated process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal trans-differentiaion in a dominant-negative Smad3 cells (Bhowmick et al., 2001) . In addition, Rac1 activation promoted TGF-\u03b2-dependent collagen expression in mesangial cells (Hubchak et al., 2009) . LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated that SARS-CoV PLpro influenced the ubiquitination status of Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1), Ras GTPaseactivating-like protein IQGAP1, Ras-related protein Rab (Rab5C), putative Ras-related protein Rab (Rab1C), and Ras GTPase-activating protein-binding protein (G3BP1) ( Table 1) . Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting assays indicated the increased expression of Rac1 in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro compared to vector control (Fig. 5) . Since activation of Jak/STAT pathway in a Rac-dependent manner was identified in response to the agonist of protein-coupled receptors (Pelletier et al., 2003) , STAT-dependent signals were investigated in this study. The TGF-\u03b2RI inhibitor SB-431542 significantly attenuated the phosphorylation and nuclear localization of STAT6 in transfected cells with pSARS-PLpro (Fig. 6) . Meanwhile, the STAT6 inhibitor AS1517499 meaningfully reduced TGF-\u03b21-dependent up-regulation of Type I collagen in PLpro-expressing cells (Fig. 7) . The results indicated Fig. 6 . Nuclear localization of STAT6 in transfected lung epithelial cells in response to SB-431542. For analyzing the effect of SB-431542 on nuclear localization of STAT6, transfected cells were treated with or without SB-431542 for 2 days, washed, fixed, and reacted with primary antibodies against phospho-STAT6, followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. After staining with DAPI for 10 min, imaging was analyzed by immunofluorescent microscopy. that STAT6 activation was required for PLpro-induced TGF-\u03b21-dependent expression of Type I collagen in human lung epithelial cells and mouse lung tissues. The result was accordant with the previous reports in that STAT6-dependent collagen production has been demonstrated in human skin fibroblasts and mouse airway fibroblasts (Kippenberger et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2014) . SARS-CoV PLpro affected on the ubiquitination and expression profile of Rho-like GTPase family proteins that could link with the activation of STAT6 signaling in TGF-\u03b21dependent collagen expression, in which suggested that a new GTPase proteins/STAT6 pathway might play a critical role in TGF-\u03b21-dependent collagen production in PLpro-expressing cells.",
