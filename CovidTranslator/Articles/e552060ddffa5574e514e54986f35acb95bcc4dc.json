Craig Venter Institute, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, are sequencing various pathogenic genomes, including different viral genomes. Thousands of influenza genomes and hundreds of coronavirus genomes, rotavirus genomes and other viral genomes were sequenced by MSC. Viral genomes are relatively small (ranging from a few kb to 100 kb) compared with bacterial and eukaryotic genomes. However, the genome structure and gene features can be as complex as eukaryotic genomes. In addition to the normal splicing to generate mature messenger ribonucleicacid (mRNA) like the splicing in eukaryotic genome, a variety of complex gene features, such as alternative splicing, ribosomal slippage, ribonucleicacid (RNA) editing, stop codon leakage (stop codon read-through), ribosomal shunting (alternative translation initiation) and gene overlapping, can also be found in many viral genomes. A large number of viruses, such as rhinovirus and yellow fever virus, have only one open reading frame encoded in their small genomes. The single polyprotein of these viruses needs to be processed into mature peptides that will be incorporated into virus structure and be functional during virus replication. These complex gene features must be accurately defined in order to correctly understand these genomes.",

In order to efficiently validate genome sequence data and accurately annotate the viral genomes sequenced by MSC, a homology-based viral gene prediction program called VIGOR (Viral Genome ORF Reader, http://www.jcvi .org/vigor) was developed at J.

To identify the RNA editing site, reference V or D protein sequence is aligned to the protein sequence deduced from genomic sequence to locate the frame-shifting region. In measles virus, Sendai virus, bPIV-3, hPIV-3, the sequence string AAAAAGGG immediately upstream the editing site is conserved and is screened to identify the RNA editing site (4, 5) . A single G residue is added into the complementary DNA sequence of measles virus at the editing site and the reading frame shifts from +1 to +2; in hPIV-3, bPIV-3 and Sendai virus, two G residues are inserted at the editing site.

For each individual virus types, 27 to 240 complete genomes, depending on the availabilities in NCBI, were run through VIGOR for comparison. The comparison data is presented in Table 1 . The full descriptions of correct prediction, partial agreement, missing gene and new gene were depicted previously (3) . In brief, a prediction is considered correct if both start and stop codons of the gene predicted by VIGOR are the same as these in the GenBank annotation, and if the gene-specific features (like the RNA editing site and stop read-through site) exist, then they must agree with the GenBank record. The following two types of predictions will be counted as partial agreements: stop codon and the reading frame are the same as these in GenBank record, but start codon is different; for some genes, an internal stop codon is detected and the truncated protein sequence is shorter than 95% of its reference sequence length (protein length is >150 aa), VIGOR defines these genes as nonfunctional genes and marks the predictions with 'possible sequence mutation,' but these genes are annotated as functional genes in GenBank. Missing gene means that no gene is detected by VIGOR in a region where one or more genes are annotated in GenBank. If a gene is predicted in a genomic sequence and no gene was documented in the same region with same reading frame in GenBank, this prediction will be inspected manually. If it is highly homologous to a related viral protein (E < 1e-10), the prediction will be counted as a new gene.",

The three mature peptides (C, PrM/M and E) from the N-terminus of the polyprotein are structural proteins, and the other seven or eight mature peptides from the C-terminus are non-structural proteins. One hundred seventy complete genomes of both YFV and JEV were tested by VIGOR, a total of 170 polyprotein genes were predicted by VIGOR because only a single gene is encoded in each genome (13, 14) . The start and stop codons of these genes were in complete agreement with GenBank annotations ( Table 1 ). The polyprotein of JEV is cleaved into 10 mature peptides (13) . Eleven mature peptides are encoded in YFV genome (14) .

Noroviruses constitute a genus in the calicivirus family. The viruses enclose a non-segmented, positive singlestranded RNA genome of 7.7 kb with three genes encoded (16) . The second and third genes encode viral structure proteins named VP1 and VP2. The first large ORF encodes a non-structural protein that will be digested into six mature peptides by the viral 3C-like protease (3CL pro ). The mature peptides p48, NTPase, p22, VPg, 3CL pro and RdRp are ordered from N-to C-terminus (16) . VIGOR predicted 294 genes in 98 norovirus genomes. All of these 294 predictions agreed with GenBank annotations (Table 1) . Only a small number of norovirus genomes have their mature peptides annotated in GenBank. The mature peptides predicted by VIGOR completely agreed with GenBank annotations when available. For those without mature peptide annotations in GenBank, the conserved cleavage sites (p48-(QG)-NTPase-(QG)-p22-(EG)-VPg-(EA)-3CL pro -(EA)-RdRp) were inspected, and the alignments between VIGOR prediction and homologous peptides were also examined.

The genomes of VEEV and alphavirus are 11.5 kb, and the 5' two-thirds of RNA encodes two non-structural proteins, which are cleaved into three or four peptides required for RNA genome replication. The 3' one-third of the genomes encodes a structural protein that is cleaved into three mature peptides (C, E2 and E1) by proteases (9) . In the first large gene of VEEV and some alphaviruses, a stop codon (UGA) is present downstream of the coding sequence of mature peptide nsP3. The translation stops at this UGA codon on most mRNA. However, for a small percentage of mRNA, translational read-through occurs at this stop codon, an arginine or another residue is incorporated at this position and the translation is extended to the next stop codon (9, 19, 20) . A larger non-structural protein is synthesized because of the translational read-through and one additional mature peptide (nsP4) is translated. The mature peptide cleavage sites are identified based on the alignments between the polyprotein and the homologs in the mature peptide database. Once the junction region is located between two consecutive mature peptides, the conserved signature sequences next to the cleavage sites are used to identify the exact position of the cleavage. The conserved signature sequences were documented in literature (9) .",

Like other members of the paramyxovirus family, the P gene is also polycistronic and encodes two to six different proteins. Sendai virus is the best studied virus in the paramyxovirus family. The P gene gives rise to a maximum of six different proteins by means of RNA editing, overlapping frames and ribosomal shunting (5, 22, 23, 12) . The V protein is produced from the edited mRNA. The faithful transcript encodes the P protein. Four additional proteins (C', C, Y1 and Y2) are also encoded in the polycistronic P gene by a process known as ribosomal shunting (12, 23) . Here, different start codons including a non-ATG codon (ACG or GCG for C' protein in the UTR region of the P gene) are used by ribosome to initiate translations. In the hPIV-1 genome, the P gene doesn't encode the edited mRNA that will be translated into V or D protein as is the case in other related viruses (24) . However, the small proteins (C', C, Y1 and Y2) encoded by the alternative start codons are detected in hPIV-1 genomes. The P gene of hPIV-3 encodes at least four proteins (P, D, C and V) (25) . P and C proteins are encoded by the non-edited mRNA with different frames. The D protein will be translated from this edited mRNA with the insertion of two non-templated Gs at the RNA editing site (25) . The edited mRNA of bPIV-3 encodes the D protein with two non-templated G residues inserted at the RNA editing site. A C protein is also encoded in the P gene with a different reading frame (26) . hPIV-2 and hPIV-4 are members of the rubulavirus genus. Like other members in the same genus, the P protein is encoded by the edited mRNA with the addition of two G residues at the editing site, while the faithfully transcribed mRNA encodes the V protein (8, 27) .

If reference protein sequences of a new virus are available and the genome structure and complex gene features of the new virus are well understood, virus species-specific modules can be developed to identify the complex gene features (if they exist) in the virus genomes. With the drop of sequencing cost and the increase of sequencing productivity, tremendous number of different virus species from both clinical and environmental samples will be sequenced. The accuracy and efficiency of gene prediction will be critical to interpret newly sequenced viral genomes and to understand these viruses. VIGOR can be extended to annotate the genomes of new viruses by incorporating new reference sequences into the protein database and developing the virus species-specific modules.",
