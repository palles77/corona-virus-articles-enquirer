Further, we discuss the plausibility of antibiotic resistant plague bacterium, F1-negative Y. pestis, and also the possibility of a plague mimic along with potential strategies of defense against these. An extensive literature search on the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases was conducted to collate papers relevant to plague and its deliberate release. Our review concluded that the deliberate release of plague is feasible but unlikely to occur, and that a robust public health response and early treatment would rapidly halt the transmission of plague in the population. Front-line clinicians should be aware of the potential of a deliberate release of plague and prepared to instigate early isolation of patients. Moreover, front-line clinicians should be weary of the possibility of suicide attackers and mindful of the early escalation to public health organizations.",

            "text": "Y. pestis, a gram-negative bacterium of the Enterobacteriaceae family, is a zoonotic pathogen and the causative agent of plague. 1 The Enterobacteriaceae family consists of 11 species of bacteria, of which 3 are pathogenic in humans, namely; Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica. 2 While Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica cause a self-limiting gastrointestinal illness, Y. pestis causes a severe, acute and rapidly progressing febrile illness with high mortality rates. 2 Y. pestis is a nonmotile, non-spore-forming coccobacillus, that exhibits bipolar staining. The organism can grow in a wide range of temperatures from 4 to 40\u00b0C, and can tolerate a wide range of pH, from 5 to 9.6. 1 This demonstrates how Y. pestis is somewhat resistant to environmental conditions, furthermore, when contained in small droplets at least one hour of sunlight is needed to kill the organism, and it can resist drying for many days. 3 Plague is primarily a vector-borne illness transmitted by fleas to a variety of wild rodents in many habitats in the world -representing a natural reservoir for the disease. 4 The classical vector of Y. pestis is the oriental rat flea, Xenopsylla cheopis, but 30 different flea species have been shown to be vectors of Y. pestis. 1, 5 With the use of next-generation DNA sequencing and the recovery of Y. pestis DNA from the teeth of prehistoric individuals, it has been estimated that Y. pestis evolved from Y. pseudotuberculosis around 5700-6000 years ago with the introduction of some virulenceassociated plasmids. 2 This new knowledge about the abovementioned close genetic similarity between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, the plasmids (pCD1, pPCP1 and pMT1) and the F1 capsular antigen, plays an important role in recent vaccine development efforts. However, currently there is no worldwide license for any vaccine against Y. pestis. 2,6-10",

Lasting from 1347-1351, it is one of the best historical examples of an emerging infection with rapid dissemination and a high mortality. 15 The Black Death is thought to have led to the death of 30 -50% of Europe's population at that time. 16 The third and final great pandemic originated in China in the 1860 s, but exploded across the globe after a major outbreak in Hong Kong 1894 and rapidly spread worldwide-primarily through trade routes on steamships and railways, 14 leading to the death of more than 10 million people. 13 ",

As a result, the fleas which were feeding on them lose their main food supply and start feeding on humans spreading the plague-causing bacteria through their bites. 14 Currently, the three most endemic countries are Madagascar, and The Democratic Republic of Congo and Peru. 17 From 1957-1997, internationally, there were 80,163 confirmed cases 1 notified to WHO with 6578 deaths in 38 countries. 20 More recently, from 2010-2015 there have been 3248 confirmed cases of plague in humans resulting in 584 deaths. 18 Madagascar now accounts for around 75% of the global plague cases reported to WHO. 19 During the most recent urban plague epidemic, which occurred in late 2017 in Madagascar, 2414 plague cases were reported leading to 221 deaths. This was a particularly important outbreak as, unusually, the majority (78%) of cases were of primary pneumonic plague, the deadliest form of plague, with a human-to-human transmission, leading to a large international multisectoral response to prevent international spread. 19 The index case of this outbreak was one gentleman who had spread his infection to others travelling alongside him on public transport, eventually spreading the disease throughout the capital. 19 Through epidemiological studies we can understand that plague is endemic in many areas of the world but is still very uncommon. 17,18",

Often the buboes are so painful they completely restrict movement of the affected limb, and range between 1-10 cm in diameter. 24 Rarely, the primary lymph node affected is retroperitoneal, or even intraperitoneal giving the impression of an acute surgical abdomen on examination. 26 From the bubo, in untreated patients especially, bacteria then disseminate throughout the body resulting in secondary septicemic plague, and/or secondary pneumonic plague. 27 The mortality of untreated bubonic plague can be as high as 60%, but it is largely reduced to less than 5% if detected early and treated with effective antimicrobial therapy. 25 ",

The initial purulent sputum may become tinged with blood or be acutely haemorrhagic. 27 Over time the cough becomes increasingly productive and in the final stages patients produce vast volumes of bright red sputum containing ''an enormous number of plague bacilli in almost pure culture\". 32 In pneumonic plague, if antibiotics are not started within 24 h, the mortality rates can reach 100%. 2, 25 Even with proper antibiotic treatment up to 50% of patients can still die due to the severity of the infection and many would require admission to an intensive care facility. 21 As pneumonic plague is transmissible from person to person, many studies have been undertaken to ascertain the basic reproduction number 3 34 , with many quoting an average secondary infection rate of around 1.3. 25, 34 Further modelling has developed our understanding of super spreading events (SSE) where a certain individual may infect many more individuals, while the majority of individuals would fail to transmit to anyone else. If early in a disease outbreak there are many SSEs, the rate of transmission could be much higher than the often quoted R 0 of 1.3. This could also have been the case in the recent epidemic in Madagascar in 2017 as the reproductive number quoted was 2.4 (1.6-3.6) despite Madagascar's relative preparedness from previous (although smaller) plague outbreaks. 35 ",

This first method was relatively ineffective, as they failed to bring enough people in contact with the fleas this way. Unit 731 then moved to restrict the target population's food sources and then proceeded to airdrop flea-infested wheat and other food sources. The unsuspecting famished inhabitants then rushed to gather the infested food and as a result they were bitten by the fleas initiating an outbreak of plague. [49] [50] [51] The most well-documented of these numerous attacks, in particular in a 2019 historical reconstruction, was the Ningbo outbreak that occurred on the October 27, 1940. 48 All of the cases reported were of bubonic plague, apart from one case of pneumonic plague in a health worker. The reported aim of Unit 731 was to kill 1,450 Ningbo citizens, but the outbreak killed only 112 people despite a case fatality of 68%. This was mostly attributed to the robust public health response of the population and officials, despite unfamiliarity with plague. 47, 48, 52 The community acted together to quarantine those infected and return those who were infected and had fled back to isolation hospitals, they erected 14-foot concrete walls around infected buildings and burned them to the ground, rapidly identified and isolated suspected human cases, destroyed all rodents, and killed all cats, dogs and any other companion animals. 48, 53 This evasion of social disintegration and panic, and unified response by the local population provides an example that even in the pre-antibiotic era public health response could mitigate the disruptive societal effects of a biological weapon, including plague. However, this occurred in a population that was trained to be under attack for many years, and as a result was able to develop coping mechanisms to high threat situationsquite different to our populations in the west now. 47,48",

However, for plague aerosolization, a high bacterial concentration is needed, which may require more advanced techniques. 57 Moreover, as the CDC recommends, the use of a Biosafety level 2 laboratory is required for prevention of harm to the scientist performing the experiments. 57 The presence of Y. pestis could be confirmed through PCR, or from inoculation of mice and specimen culture of those that die within 21 days. 58, 59 The question then arises, once obtained, ''how would one covertly transport the bacteria across the world?,\" for example, from the location obtained to a ''laboratory\" in another country. Through experimental data it is understood that some strains of Y. pestis are still culturable up to 138 days when stored in bottled water at 26\u00b0C, 60 and most strains are culturable until 21 days in sterilized tap water stored at 4\u00b0C. 61 Therefore, it is theoretically possible that Y. pestis can be surreptitiously transported across the world by camouflaging it using perfume bottles or bottled water to be cultured elsewhere to multiply it to larger quantities.",

The most feared and studied use of plague as a biological weapon would be a deliberate release of pneumonic plague as an aerosol. 2 Aerosolized biological warfare agents, in particulate form between 0.3-5 mm in diameter pose a huge risk to the public in a bioweapons attack 46,62 as they can penetrate directly into the alveoli with normal inhalation. Y. pestis has the potential, in an aerosol form, to be a true silent killer; the particles could be delivered into the lungs without any warning. 62 As an aerosol it would be odorless and invisible to susceptible and unknowing humans of all ages and sexes. 17, 62 Therefore, the deployment of medical countermeasures would only be undertaken once cases were found from the emergence of signs and symptoms -for pneumonic plague this could take up to 4 days for some people, although most commonly signs and symptoms occur within 2 days. 25 Aerosol generators such as a Collison nebulizer, or other makeshift devices if needed, mounted on any form of vehicle, including aircraft, would enable mechanical aerosol release of Y. pestis. 3 The WHO estimated that an aerosol release of 50 kg of plague over a city of 5 million people would result in 150,000 initial clinical cases, and 36,000 deaths. Even more dangerous they reported, would be the transmission to secondary cases leading to a total of up to 500,000 hospitalizations and up to 100,000 deaths spread over a number of weeks, not including the spread to other cities. 3 Aerosolization involves a complicated process and can spread plague in either dry or liquid form. In liquid form it would be easy to disseminate with commercially available sprayers; however, it would be difficult to prevent the bacteria from dying during this process. Although release of a freeze-dried powder would be much easier, its production would be a very dangerous process. The major difficulty in aerosolization would be producing particles less than 5 mm in diameter, as any larger particles would not be able to reach the alveoli and hence be useless in propagating the disease. Therefore, the most difficult step in the process of creating a plague bioweapon would likely be its aerosolization. 63 Another possible release strategy could include air conditioning units and the use of the London Underground as a commuter hub. 46 This is a preferred location for an attack as it offers the opportunity to infect the large numbers of people who use the trains, who are in close proximity to one another (within the necessary two meters) making it easy to transmit to secondary cases. Moreover, in this transmission process, locating the source of the release would probably prove more difficult as passengers would be traveling to and from many locations. Furthermore, being underground there would be no direct sunlight to degrade the bacteria. 14 There would be multiple surfaces for Y. pestis to seed onto and survive on, as it can survive on glass and stainless steel for up to 72 h, 64 and theoretically the air currents in the tube network could then re-aerosolize the pathogen from these surfaces causing further dissemination.",

A human (or more than one) would be purposefully infected with the pneumonic plague, then undertake the mission of infecting as many people as possible, in a similar mechanism of a super spreading event (SSE). This could be modelled in a very similar way to the recent plague outbreak in Madagascar in 2017, 19, 34 where we saw an explosion in cases of pneumonic plague originating from a single source with multiple secondary infections. Computer modelling of the transmission dynamics of pneumonic plague demonstrated an R 0 of around 1.0, but described that in the beginning of the disease if there are super spreading events then the rate of secondary infection can be much higher (R 0 1.6) and propagate the disease in the population rapidly before public health interventions are initiated. 33, 34, 65 These models were described with the SSE expected to be like that in the natural transmission of pneumonic plague, but a suicide attack could theoretically infect many more cases than estimated in the model and spread the disease much faster. Furthermore, with advancements in the understanding of transmission of pneumonic plague we know that mammal-to-mammal transmission involves the transfer of organisms that have been growing at 37\u00b0C to an environment which is also at 37\u00b0C. 2, 66 We know that many virulence factors and genes in Y. pestis are activated once the bacteria move from 26\u00b0C to 36\u00b0C, from flea midgut to mammalian tissues. 67 Therefore, the bacteria when travelling from human to human, as would occur in a suicide attack, would transmit a more virulent and already adapted form of Y. pestis probably leading to a more severe clinical syndrome. 2, 67 These suicide attackers could also wreak havoc in the public health response by refusing to wear protective face masks and aim to purposefully spread disease in hospitals and other health care centers and maliciously infect healthcare workers before the threat of the disease is realized.",

Similar to the attacks undertaken by the Japanese Unit 731 in 1940, 48 a release of fleas infected with Y. pestis could be a viable method of releasing plague as a biological weapon. 21, 53 The fleas could be infected by allowing them to feast on mammals infected with the plague that could be found in nature or given the infection by direct inoculation. 58, 68 Depending on the mechanism of releasing the fleas, for example by direct release from an aircraft by dropping nonexplosive missiles, there could be a location-based release which would have a more acute response than a covert attack. 46 Then, the initial outbreak could be identified as the casualties travel directly to emergency departments similar to what would be expected in a chemical weapons attack. 69 Assuming it was successful, an attack with fleas would primarily cause bubonic plague 21 and rarely primary septicemic plague, as the fleas feast on the humans as their primary source of blood and inoculate them with the bacteria. There would be no humanto-human transmission except by secondary pneumonic plague, which only 3% of bubonic plague cases develop into. 25 With the development and use of insecticides the contagion could be contained rapidly, so an attack like this is rendered unlikely. 48, 70 Furthermore, as bubonic plague is less virulent than pneumonic plague, 2 and antibiotics are an effective treatment -particularly if initiated early as they seemingly would be here, then mortality could be kept low -possibly even less than the estimated 5% mortality with early intervention. 25 Hence, a deliberate release of plague by using infected fleas as vectors is a feasible attack option, as it has been done to a moderate effect before, but is unlikely to be used since the response would be particularly robust, resulting in low mortality rates.",

The success of a deliberate release of Y. pestis would be quantified by the fear, societal disruption and panic rather than the number of deaths, by the attackers. 42 A deliberate release of pneumonic plague would be particularly likely to create fear in the public for a number of reasons. The pathology of pneumonic infection, which is silent in the beginning with seemingly innocent symptoms, can develop rapidly to a fatal syndrome within 24 hours, 21 so those who feel they might have symptoms may rush anxiously to seek medical attention. Also, the possibility of a relatively slower death compared to an incendiary device could cause more terror. As plague is transmissible between humans, unlike anthrax and botulinum, it could create fears of a spreading pandemic across the nation, particularly since people would know little about this modern-day infection with Y.",

With the tremendous technological advancements in science and medicine over the last few decades, the major restrictions of using biological weapons are formed by international opinion, rather than capability. 42, 63 Possible aggressors who could have a role in the deliberate release of biological weapons would include individuals, rogue terrorist states, and there is also the possibility of biological warfare from state actors. 46 Biological weapons have been known as ''the poor man's nuclear bomb\" as they are relatively cheap for the damage they cause, and can cause significant economic disruption, but they can be difficult to produce and disseminate on a large enough scale. 46 Individuals and rogue states would likely have difficulty in producing and dispersing pneumonic plague due to technical constraints related to cell culture and dispersal of plague, but it would not be impossible. 63 According to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972, nations are prohibited to undertake research to produce biological weapons or to produce and stockpile them. 71 However, the BWC has no inspection mechanism and a biological weapons research and production program would be relatively easy to hide in a nation's biotechnological infrastructure. 42 Furthermore, it does not describe which biological agents are not to be developed or what quantities would go beyond defensive research. 42 Notwithstanding those who have signed and ratified the BWC, it is fairly certain that a number of rogue nations or those willing to risk international disgrace are secretly carrying out their own biological weapons research. There are numerous allegations that many countries have biological weapons programs including China, Egypt, Iran, Israel, North Korea, Russia, Syria and the USA, but all deny these allegations. 72 The most recent chemical weapons attack on British soil was almost certain to have been undertaken by the Russian state using Novichok. 73, 74 This preposterous action could be a defining moment in a change in warfare to make state on state violence more likely, and the states would probably be able to use plague.",

The first of these people will begin to have coryzal symptoms, headache, malaise and fever, which is to be expected to lead them to their General Practitioner or local Emergency Department. It is likely that they will be diagnosed with a viral upper respiratory tract infection and be discharged home with a normal chest x-ray at such an early stage. 75, 76 3. Within the next 24 hours (with the length of time depending on their initial bacterial challenge and their immune status) a significant number of patients will suddenly deteriorate and begin to develop respiratory failure and have hemoptysis. 21 4 . Blood and sputum cultures of the bacteria causing the pneumonia will be taken and antibiotics would begin and according to national guidance, the severity of the disease would be calculated, and the treatment delivered relative to this. As we know the early and accurate initiation of antibiotics is vital in treating pneumonic plague and reducing mortality. The first line antibiotic for mild, moderate and severe community acquired pneumonia is a penicillin (in many locations) which would be ineffective against plague, but the addition of a macrolide would provide some limited coverage. The 2nd line, or for those with penicillin allergies, is doxycycline (or an alternative tetracycline) which is highly active and recommended against Y. pestis. Ideally, respiratory precautions would be undertaken with any suspicion of Influenza or Mycobacterium tuberculosis, infections these patients would be highly likely suspected of having. 77 ",

The recent testing of the international public health response from the COVID-19 pandemic has primed all populations to understand the requirements of a robust response, and be practised in implementing self-isolation techinques and social distancing.

For example, we could request all patients who suspect that they are symptomatic to come to a mass treatment center (such as a local sports hall) and evaluate all patients there for convenience and ease. However, it could have drawbacks, including increasing transmission between patients with plague and those with either no disease or with the flu -this is particularly risky in the possibility of a suicide attack event with plague. 80 Another potential treatment strategy could include a method similar to the influenza plan, with patients remaining at home and calling a phone number to be assessed over the phone and having a ''flu friend\" to go to the local pharmacy to obtain antivirals or antibiotics in the case of plague. A flu friend being someone who does not have any symptoms at all. 79 Therefore, maintaining some level of isolation of patients from each other.",

The WHO proposes two potential strategies for vaccination: a reactive vaccine to prevent plague during an outbreak and to interrupt the chains of transmission, and a prophylactic vaccine used primarily in endemic areas. A reactive vaccine would be most ideal for use in deliberate release but would require a number of ''critical\" qualities, as defined by WHO, to make it effective. It would need to provide safe and long-lasting protection, be effective against all strains and all forms of plague including pneumonic, and be easily delivered to large volumes of the population -preferably through oral or mucosal routes. 90 There are currently 17 potential plague vaccines in the pipeline, of which a number show very promising results -such as oral vaccination with Y. pseudotuberculosis as the two pathogens have surprisingly similar genetic information. 6, 7, 14, 90 Other positive recent advancements include bacteriophage vaccines 91 and another vaccine which protects against both plague and anthrax. 8 Furthermore, the food and drug administration (FDA) has granted ''orphan drug status\" 92 for a plague vaccine for marketing in 2020 after successfully completing phase 2 trials; although this is a recombinant vaccine against only the F1 capsular antigen and the low-calcium-response V antigen (LcrV) of Y. pestis. 7,10 This, however, will not provide protection against F1 negative strains of plague, which exist in nature and could be used as a bioweapon, rendering the vaccine useless.",

One could potentially obtain some of these MDR strains from nature; however they are exceptionally rare and would be extremely difficult to find. 101 From our understanding of the biology of antibiotic resistance in Y. pestis, which originated from plasmid transfer, there is significant potential for artificial creation of MDR plague.

Significant amounts of research have been undertaken into alternative therapies against Y. pestis, including, immunotherapy, immunomodulatory therapy, phage therapy, bacteriocin therapy, and the use of inhibitors of virulence factors. These have shown some promise in mouse studies, but they are a long way away from being used in clinical practice, yet hope remains they will provide a new line of defense against MDR plague. 103, 104 In summary, an attack of MDR plague, although possible, is very unlikely due to technical limitations. The public health response would be even more important in this situation, the primary aim would be the reduction in the number of people infected to begin with, then the simultaneous treatment of those infected with a wide range of antibiotics (for example trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole has successfully been used in a single case of MDR plague 98 ) and the consideration of alternative therapies. Furthermore, thoughtful consideration should be taken when treating plague in the mass casualty setting, as massive administration of singular antimicrobial medications may lead to the preferential selection of antibiotic resistant strains. 105 ",

There have previously been allegations that some nation's biological warfare programs created F1-negative strains of Y. pestis and stored them. 51 Therefore, we must be convinced of the coverage of the vaccine we roll out before we do so and rely on clinical judgement for the treatment of patients rather than solely on tests. It is also possible that a genetically modified plague is developed, depending on the creator of the bioweapon and their potential capabilities. Probably, most post-graduate level microbiologists or geneticists would have no difficulty in doing this successfully, developing already deadly bacteria into something even more evil. However, we must remember that the public health response, specifically the use of modest measures such as social distancing and simple face masks can completely eliminate the transmission of pneumonic plague.",

This could lead to a huge number of patients presenting to many healthcare centers with fear of having the symptoms of pneumonic plague, overwhelming the services.

A vaccine against Y. pestis would be ideal for reactive or prophylactic immunization. We are relatively close to producing a potential vaccine but at this moment there are no available plague vaccines, particularly against F1-negative plague, which is an additional potential danger.
