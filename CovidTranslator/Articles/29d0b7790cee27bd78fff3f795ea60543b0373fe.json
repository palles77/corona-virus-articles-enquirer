Classically, it causes a lobar pattern of consolidation that is characterized by the initial development of a peripheral opacity that rapidly becomes confluent. Air-bronchograms are common. Inflammation occurs predominantly at the level of the alveolar sac when the organism is inhaled. There is alveolar spread and the inflammatory response spreads throughout the lung through small channels-the canals of Lambert and the pores of Kohn. The spread of this process through collateral channels, rather than bronchioles, explains why this pattern of pneumonia often does not follow a segmental distribution. The infection easily crosses pulmonary segments and inflammation is limited by pleural boundaries. In addition to localized lobar consolidation, Streptococcus pneumoniae-associated pneumonia also has atypical appearances, such as bronchopneumonia or an interstitial pattern [2] . One study that investigated the radiographic appearances in 81 in-patients with culture-documented pneumococcal pneumonia demonstrated a lobar pattern of consolidation in 81% of the patients. Lobar consolidation was focal in 48% of patients and multifocal in 33%. A bronchopneumonia/ lobular pattern of consolidation, often with peribronchial thickening, occurred in 19%. A bronchopneumonia pattern results when infections begin in bronchi and bronchioles and then extend into the contiguous airspace. It usually is patchy, multifocal, bilateral, heterogeneous, and nonconfluent. The radiographic pattern is not influenced by HIV status. Pleural effusions are uncommon, and in this study, were found in 11% of patients [Figs. 1 and 2] [7] .",

Responsible viruses include influenza, adenovirus, measles, varicella zoster, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). Influenza viruses types A and B account for most viral pneumonias in immunocom- petent adults. Immunocompromised patients are susceptible to CMV and other herpesvirus. Viruses can result in several forms of lower respiratory tract infections, including tracheobronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is particularly severe in elderly and immunocompromised patients. Overall, patients who have viral pneumonia tend to have less severe illness than patients who have bacterial pneumonia, and they may complain of a dry hacking cough with minimal radiographic findings. Cultures often are necessary to make a definitive diagnosis.",

The prevalence of PCP has been decreasing with antibiotic prophylaxis. The diagnosis is suggested strongly by typical history, low CD4 count, and hypoxia. Induced sputum can establish the diagnosis, or alternatively, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage can be used in patients who are at risk but who have a negative sputum induction result. The radiographic appearance of PCP demonstrates considerable variation. The CXR can be normal; typical radiographic findings include bilateral perihilar air space disease or reticular markings [ Fig. 15 ]. On CT, acute infection classically results in perihilar ground glass opacification, often in a geographic distribution with areas of affected lung interspersed by normal lung parenchyma. A linear or reticular pattern is demonstrated frequently with thickening of the interlobular septa causing a ''crazy paving'' pattern [ Fig. 16 ] [18] [19] [20] . Some patients develop thin-walled cystic areas (pneumatoceles) that have an upper lobe distribution. Typically, these cysts do not contain fluid or other material. The exact etiology of pneumatoceles is unclear although a variety of mechanisms has been suggested, including check valve obstruction of small airways, pulmonary infarction, and production of proteases or elastases with lung digestion. Pneumatoceles may predispose to pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum [ Fig. 17 ]. Atypical manifestations of PCP include focal consolidation, mass lesions, cavitation, and adenopathy [ Fig. 18 ]. Multifocal air space consolidation can be seen if the patient has been ill for some time. Characteristically, pleural effusions are absent [2] . HRCT is highly sen-sitive and in a study by Hidalgo and colleagues [21] , 10% of HIV-positive patients who had PCP and a normal CXR had an abnormal HRCT. Ground glass areas were found in all of the patients. A normal HRCT is said to rule out PCP pneumonia [22] .",

Almost one half of cases demonstrate a radiographic pattern other than focal consolidation that can mimic infections by nonbacterial pathogens such as PCP [23] . Bacterial infections also can present as nodules that can cavitate. A study of cavitary nodules in HIV patients by Aviram and colleagues [24] , found a bacterial cause in 85% of the cases; more than one pathogen was identified in most patients. The most frequently identified organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. In most bacterial infections, mildly enlarged lymph nodes are seen frequently on CT imaging but usually not on CXR. Visibly enlarged nodes on CXR in HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts of less than 200 \u00d7 10 6 cells/L suggests TB. Pleural effusions are uncommon in patients who have PCP, but are seen more typically in patients who have pyogenic bacterial infections.",

TB is able to survive dormant within host macrophages for long periods of time and incite a delayed hypersensitivity response by the infected host. Under normal circumstances, the host sequesters the organism by forming caseating granulomas. This initial infection has been termed the ''Ghon focus'' and usually heals by developing a fibrous capsule around the focus of infection which often calcifies. Organisms may spread through the lymphatics to hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes where a similar reaction occurs; the combination of lung and hilar infection is called the ''Ranke complex.'' Usually, host defenses are sufficient to prevent overt infection. Organisms remain viable and may serve as the nidus for reactivation when conditions become more favorable [2] .",

Reactivation in these regions may be favored by high oxygen tension and tends to occur when host defenses become impaired. Latent organisms become active and overt infection develops. Unlike the healing that commonly occurs with primary Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection, postprimary TB infection is often associated with progressive disease. As inflammation mounts, tissue destruction occurs, caseous material liquefies, and communication with the tracheobronchial tissue can ensue. This produces cavitation, the characteristic pathologic and radiologic finding of postprimary MTB. Cavitation creates the opportunity for endobronchial spread of infection and communication to other individuals. If host defenses triumph, these cavities usually heal by scar formation with bronchiectasis, volume loss, and areas of emphysema. Chronic thin-walled cavities may persist. Typical clini- cal manifestations of postprimary TB include failure to thrive, fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and lowgrade fever. Bronchiectasis may result in hemoptysis [2] .",

Bone marrow transplant (BMT) or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation involves the intravenous infusion of hematopoietic progenitor cells to replace the malignant or ablated bone marrow cells. It is used in the treatment of hematologic malignancies and certain solid tumors. Allogeneic transplantation refers to the transfer of marrow from a donor to a recipient who is not an identical twin, whereas autologous transplantation involves the use of the patient's own marrow. Pulmonary complications occur in 40% to 60% of patients who undergo BMT and are a common cause of morbidity and mortality [34] . Fig. 24 . Mycobacterium avium-intracellularae pneumonia in a middle-aged woman. CT scan demonstrates evidence of small airway disease with scattered bilateral centrilobular \"tree-in-bud\" structures (circle). Bronchial wall thickening is seen in the right middle lobe. There is a predictable time course of neutropenia, immunosuppression, and recovery that allows for the development of a post-BMT timeline in patients who receive allogeneic transplants. Knowledge of this timeline is of critical importance when confronted with an abnormal CXR in a patient who has undergone BMT. This issue is especially important as the prognosis is grim for immunosuppressed patients who have pulmonary complications. The mortality in immunosuppressed patients who require mechanical ventilation exceeded 80% [35] . A study of 200 non-HIV immunocompromised patients demonstrated that a delay of greater than 5 days in identifying the etiology of infectious ''infiltrates'' was associated with a more than threefold risk of death [36] . The radiologist's role in helping to narrow the differential diagnosis in these patients is critical. Pulmonary complications can be classified chronologically as occurring in the neutropenic or pre-engraftment period (0-30 days after BMT), in the early postengraftment period (31-100 days after BMT), or in the late post-engraftment period (>100 days after BMT). CMV and Aspergillus were the most common pathogens overall in one study [37] .",

It is characterized at histologic analysis by the invasion and occlusion of small-to mediumsized pulmonary arteries by fungal hyphae that lead to the formation of necrotic hemorrhagic nodules or pleural-based, wedge-shaped, hemorrhagic infarcts [38] . CXRs often are abnormal, but nonspecific, and reveal patchy segmental or lobar consolidation or multiple, ill-defined nodular opacities. Characteristic CT findings consist of nodules that are surrounded by a halo of ground glass attenuation (''halo sign'') or pleural-based, wedgeshaped areas of consolidation. These findings correspond to hemorrhagic infarcts. In severely neutropenic patients, the halo sign is highly suggestive of angioinvasive aspergillosis; however, a similar appearance has been described in several other conditions, such as candida, mucor, herpes simplex, CMV, and Kaposi's sarcoma [ Fig. 26 ] [39] . As the patient's immune system recovers, about 2 weeks after the onset of infection, CXR or CT may demonstrate an ''air crescent sign,'' corresponding to necrotic lung around retracted infarcted lung. Although this finding is not specific for angioinvasive aspergillosis, it is highly characteristic in the proper clinical setting, especially when the initial lesion is consolidation or a mass [38] . Air crescent formation was shown to be associated with improved survival [ Fig. 27 ] [40] .",

In late 2001, 23 cases of anthrax were reported, 11 of which were inhalational. Five of the patients who had the inhalational form died [46] . The possibility of terrorism still exists and, it is important for health care providers to consider anthrax in the appropriate differential diagnosis because the clinical manifestations of early disease are nonspecific and the predicted case fatality of inhalational anthrax, based on historical data, is approximately 90% [48] . Timely diagnosis can reduce mortality substantially and initiate public health and law enforcement measures.",
