Although the intranasal route is efficient to deliver native rhCAT to the lung, the therapeutic effect is limited by rapid elimination from the blood. In this study, we modified rhCAT with the active polymer, polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether (PEG)-5000, and analyzed the pharmacokinetics of PEGylated rhCAT in mice. The high tetra-PEGylation ratio was about 60 %, and PEGylation prolonged the half-life of rhCAT in serum (75 vs. 13.5 min for native rhCAT). The protective effects of PEG-rhCAT were investigated in a mouse model of influenza virus A (H1N1)-associated pneumonia. PEG-rhCAT was more effectively delivered than native rhCAT and was associated with higher survival ratio, less extensive lung injuries, reduced ROS levels, and lower viral replication. Collectively, these findings indicate that PEGylation can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of native rhCAT and suggest that PEGylated rhCAT may represent a novel complement therapy for H1N1 influenza-induced pneumonia.",

CAT works by catalyzing the decomposition of H 2 O 2 into molecular oxygen and water (Lv et al. 2009; Ogbeyalu et al. 2009; Brian 2009 ). CAT plays an important role in the development of tolerance to oxidative stress. This process has been defined as protective against several pathological conditions, such as allergies (Yoshimaru et al. 2006) , atherosclerosis (Kudchodkar et al. 2007 ), ischemia (Hanawa et al. 2009 ), chronic granulomatous (Yu et al. 2008) , metastatic tumor progression (Nishikawa et al. 2009; Hyoudou et al. 2004) , and aging (Brown-Borg and Rakoczy 2000) . The potential of catalase as a therapeutic agent has been explored for many different diseases and in many different forms, including gene therapy (Guy et al. 1998 ) and recombinant catalase (Yabe et al. 1999) , for well over a decade. In a previous study, we found that inhalation of native recombinant human catalase (rhCAT) elicited a protective effect in mice with influenzaassociated pneumonia (Shi et al. 2010) .",

Virus invasion of the bronchi and/or alveoli in the lung destroys these structures, leading to a drastic reduction of the air space that is essential for oxygen/CO 2 exchange (Hurt et al. 2004 ). The immune response to the virus manifests as increased vasodilation and leakage of leukocytes and neutrophils into the lung tissue, ultimately resulting in life-threatening pulmonary edema and congestion. Studies to identify the mechanisms underlying cell death associated with influenza-induced pneumonia have implicated ROS in promoting the extent of lung injury and respiration compromise (Gangehei et al. 2010; Case et al. 2011; Nakamura et al. 2002) . Thus, it has been theorized that quenching ROS levels might be a promising strategy to alleviate the severity of viral pneumonia.",

Rats (n=6 rats/ group) were intranasally administered 100 kU/kg PEG-rhCAT (filled diamond) or native rhCAT (open circle), or left untreated (control; filled upright triangle). Blood samples were collected at the indicated time points and CAT activity was measured Fig. 2 PEGylated rhCAT significantly improved the survival rate of mice with viral pneumonia. On day 0, each group of mice (n=20/ group) was infected intranasally with influenza virus at an 8 TCID 50 dose. From day 0-7 post-infection, 100 kU/kg PEG-rhCAT (black circle) or native rhCAT (multiplication sign), or distilled saline (control; black square), were administered intranasally twice daily.

Malondialdehyde is a product of lipid peroxidation and is often present in tissues with oxidative injury. As expected, the levels of MDA were significantly increased in mice with influenza pneumonia, as compared to uninfected (saline) control mice. However, treatment with either native rhCAT or PEG-rhCAT led to a significant reduction in MDA levels (vs. the untreated virus control group; p\u2264 0.05 and p\u22640.01, respectively). Moreover, the PEGylated form was able to reduce the MDA level to a greater extent than the native form (p\u22640.01) bringing it much closer to the level detected in uninfected controls (Fig. 5a) . CAT and SOD are considered the key antioxidant enzymes of the antioxidant defense system. Activities of both CAT and SOD were found to be significantly decreased in untreated mice with influenza pneumonia. This finding indicated that the natural immune response ROS burst induced by an influenza virus invasion had exhausted the enzyme pools of the antioxidant system. Treatment with either PEGylated rhCAT or native rhCAT produced a rapid increase in both CAT (Fig. 5b) and SOD (Fig. 5c ) levels in lung tissue. These findings suggested that augmenting the natural CAT pool with rhCAT might help to restore the redox balance under conditions of viral pneumonia.

            "text": "The findings from our previous and current studies have described a novel and unique strategy to alleviate viral pneumonia by augmenting the available pool of CAT antioxidant enzyme. Proper administration via the intranasal route was key to achieve targeted delivery to the lung and optimize the potential therapeutic effects. This requirement was based upon the short half-life of our originally designed rhCAT in the native form, which precluded the usual delivery routes of intravenous, subcutaneous, and peritoneal. While intranasal administration of the native rhCAT form was capable of eliciting protective effects against influenza virus pneumonia in mice, it was necessary to extend its halflife of rhCAT to achieve the optimal therapeutic effect. Catalase is a macromolecular (240 kDa), and the most important factors for serum clearance of catalase were degradated by serum proteases and hepatic uptake. So low-molecular-weight PEG molecules were often chosen to conjugate with catalase, which obviously hindered the clearance rate (Hanawa et al. 2009; Yabe et al. 1999) Therefore, in the present study we modified rhCAT with active Y-shape PEG-5000, prolonging the half-life by fivefold over that of native rhCAT (to 75 min). Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of rhCAT were also significantly enhanced by the PEG modification. Based on the protective effects observed in mice with influenza pneumonia, we hypothesized that rhCAT may influence multiple pathogenesisrelated pathways in this disease condition.",

The immune response rapidly exhausts the pool of available antioxidants, as evidenced by low levels of CAT and SOD during the immediate-early stages of severe pathogenic infection. Augmenting the natural antioxidant pool with recombinant CAT can promote the system's ability to eliminate excessive ROS and help to restore redox balance. Indeed, intranasal administration of PEG-rhCAT helped to resolve the influenza-induced perturbations of MDA, CAT, SOD, and TAS in mice with viral pneumonia. In this manner, we presume that PEG-rhCAT therapy may down-regulate ROS, thereby helping to alleviate the destruction of lung tissues and promote survival.",

The persistent release of inflammatory factors causes significant damage to the underlying tissue and can compromise pulmonary function. In conditions of excessive amounts of ROS, the macrophageexpressed CD200 signaling molecule is activated. Activated CD200 induces expression of several chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn recruit peripheral inflammation-related cells to the virus-infected organ (Snelgrove et al. 2006; Rosenblum et al. 2004) . By augmenting the antioxidant pool with recombinant CAT, the excessive ROS may be eliminated, thereby helping to quell macrophage-mediated processes, such as apoptosis. The rhCAT-mediated clearance of ROS may also help to halt the massive influx of immunomodulatory cells, as was observed in our histopathological analyses of pulmonary tissue from PEG-rhCAT-treated mice with influenza pneumonia.",

ROS-mediated tissue injury during severe infections disrupts normal T cell development, thereby impairing adaptive immune responses and inhibiting clearance of an influenza infection (Case et al. 2011; Imai et al. 2008 ). In our study, untreated mice with influenza pneumonia presented with atrophied thymus and spleen on day 4 post-infection (data not shown). The structural destruction of immune organs had functional consequences on the immune system, impairing maturity of the adaptive immune T cells, and presumably hindering effective virus clearance. Therapeutic administration of rhCAT, however, lowered the viral load, possibly as a result of excessive ROS elimination, which would have decreased destruction of immune-related organs and helped to restore the specific adaptive immune response.",

On the seventh day post-infection, no mice in the virus control group survived; however, 90 % of the PEG-rhCAT-treated mice (18/20) and 40 % of the native rhCAT-treated mice (8/20) were still alive. By the 14th day post-infection, 50 % of the PEG-rhCAT-treated mice (10/20) had survived, but only 20 % of the native rhCAT-treated mice (4/20) had survived. These findings indicated that both native rhCAT and PEG-rhCAT elicited protective effects, as evidenced by the delay of death and improved overall survival time. Moreover, the effects of PEG-rhCAT were superior to those of the native form (90 vs. 40 % survival rate at day 7; 50 vs. 20 % survival at day 14).",
