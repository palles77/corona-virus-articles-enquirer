            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN)/CD13 is a widely expressed transmembrane ectoenzyme and has been implicated in a myriad of physiological processes that are specific to cell type and tissue origin, including cancer cell metastasis, angiogenesis, cholesterol uptake, apoptosis, and cell migration. Skin cells, in particular fibroblasts have a relatively high level of APN/CD13 expression. The migratory capacity of skin cells is critical for the outcome of wound repair, as successful wound healing requires timely re-epithelialization which involves reformation of epithelium over wound surface by migrating keratinocytes. While failure of keratinocytes to undergo proper migration leads to chronic non-healing wounds, the presence of excess fibroblasts may contribute to formation of hypertrophic scars and keloids. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of APN/CD13 in skin cell migration and explore its potential as a therapeutic target in wound healing. Our results show an elevated expression of APN/ CD13 in fibroblasts on the edge of the wound compared to unwounded cells. The presence of anti-APN/CD13 antibodies WM15, 3D8, and H300 reduces the migratory activity of human dermal fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner by 42, 21, and 28%, respectively. However, the antibodies have no effect on keratinocyte migration. Further, none of the anti-APN/CD13 antibodies used in this study has any antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on primary human keratinocytes or fibroblasts when used at 10 lg/ml in vitro. The differential inhibition on the migratory capacity of fibroblasts and keratinocytes presents an opportunity for anti-APN/CD13 antibodies to be used as a therapeutic agent for high fibroblast cellularity seen in fibroproliferative disorders.",

Following the inflammatory phase, basal keratinocytes at the wound edge begin migrating as a sheet to cover the wound surface -a process referred to as ''re-epithelialization'' [1] . While keratinocytes migrate and divide to generate a protective layer for the dermis, resident dermal fibroblasts from the deep layers of the reticular dermis and the hypodermis, as well as fibroblasts differentiating from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in the circulation enter the wound, and synthesize extracellular matrix components needed for structural repair [2, 3] . Clinically, defects in keratinocyte migration are associated with chronic non-healing wounds, while the presence of excess fibroblasts in the wound seems to contribute to hypertrophic scar formation [4, 5] .",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN, also known as APN/CD13; EC.3.4.11.2) is a heavily glycosylated transmembrane peptidase [6] that also serves as a receptor for coronaviruses such as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus and human coronavirus 229E [7, 8] . It is ubiquitously expressed in endothelial cells, monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, fibroblasts, fibroblast-like cells such as synoviocytes, epithelial cells, and synaptic membranes and pericytes [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . With dual roles as a peptide-cleaving enzyme and a cell surface receptor, APN/CD13 performs a myriad of functions in tumor cell invasion, proliferation/ apoptosis, differentiation, antigen presentation, and viral infection [15] . However, due to the short intracellular domain lacking obvious signaling motifs [16] , APN/CD13 was not regarded as a signal mediator until recently [17] . Since then, the functionality of APN/CD13 has expanded to adhesion, angiogenesis, and monocyte signaling [18] [19] [20] . For instance, Wulfaenger et al. associated the expression of enzymatically active wild-type APN/CD13 with diminished cell proliferation, migration and invasion in embryonic kidney cells [21] . Meanwhile, Pasqualini et al. demonstrated that APN/CD13 peptidase activity is necessary for endothelial invasion [17] . The broad functionality and wide-ranging expression pattern suggest that the function of this transmembrane peptidase may very well depend on the cell type and tissue origin.",

            "text": "The concept of inhibiting cell migration by reducing APN/ CD13 expression or activity through use of siRNA, chemical inhibitors or neutralizing antibodies has proven to be successful in tumor cells such as ovarian carcinoma cells [30] , and in lymphocytes and endothelial cells [31] . For instance, Mina-Osorio et al. utilized anti-APN/CD13 antibodies to induce adhesion of monocytes and endothelial cells [20] . In this study, we took advantage of the preferential expression of APN/CD13 in fibroblasts, and proved for the first time that the APN/CD13-neutralizing antibody WM15 can be used to effectively reduce the migration of fibroblasts into an open scratch wound without slowing down keratinocyte movement. Similarly to the previous finding using human lung cancer cells [24] , the inhibitory effect of the antibodies on cell migration is only partly due to the suppression of APN/CD13 enzymatic activity as shown by the enzymatic assay results. The most potent cell migration-inhibiting WM15 antibody is also the most effective enzymatic inhibitor. The other two antibodies 3D8 and H300 have similar effects on cell migration inhibition (21 vs. 28%) but suppress the enzymatic activity differently (35 vs. 15%), indicating that the observed cell migration-inhibitory effect is not entirely dependent on the enzymatic activity of APN/CD13. One possible reason is the differential binding avidity of 3D8 and H300 (monoclonal vs. polyclonal). Importantly, fibroblasts and keratinocytes were both able to maintain a healthy state even after days of exposure to WM15, preparing the antibody in a better position for in vivo clinical use which may require reported a direct correlation between enzyme activity and cell proliferation in HaCaT cells, but did not observe any antiproliferative effect by WM15 [32] . This reconfirmed our finding that neither fibroblast nor keratinocyte proliferation was affected by the presence of WM15. Thus, WM15 which has an effective dosage of as low as 1.0 lg/ ml in vitro is unlikely to reduce the viability of fibroblasts and keratinocytes or impair normal wound healing.",

Nevertheless, fibroblasts and keratinocytes are most likely to adopt distinctive regulatory mechanisms in cell migration due to differences in their external environments and surrounding cells. Thus, in order to understand why the APN/CD13-neutralizing antibody WM15 affects the migratory capacity of fibroblasts but not that of keratinocytes, more work on the mechanistic details involved in fibroblast migration will be needed. Meanwhile, a plausible rationale suggests that the differential effect might be due to enhanced antibody responsiveness in fibroblasts which have higher levels of APN/CD13 expression and activity than keratinocytes.",

Kehlen and colleagues [35, 36] have shown that direct cell-cell contact of lymphocytes with fibroblastlike synoviocytes resulted in an increase in APN/CD13 mRNA and cell surface protein in the lymphocytes. In that regard, fibroblasts seeded at a lower cell density (5.0 9 10 4 cell/cm 2 ) expressed less APN/CD13 possibly due to lack of cell-cell contact, while the limited space at higher cell densities (5.0 9 10 5 and 1.0 9 10 6 cell/cm 2 ) prevented cell movement by contact inhibition. Further, immunohistochemical staining of cells migrating into an artificially created scratch wound showed that compared to stationary cells, actively migrating cells as indicated by vinculin expression [37, 38] were expressing significantly more APN/CD13. This observation further supports our were analyzed for APN/CD13 protein expression by Western blotting, b An equal number of scratch wounds were made in X and Y directions on a confluent monolayer of dermal fibroblasts. ''Unwounded'' confluent cells were used as control. Cell lysate was obtained following overnight incubation and analyzed for APN/CD13 protein expression by Western blotting. b-actin expression was used as a loading control in both panels, c A scratch wound was made across a confluent monolayer of primary human fibroblasts, and the cells were stained with an anti-vinculin antibody and an anti-CD13 antibody, followed by Alexa 488 and Rhodamine secondary antibodies, respectively. The dotted line in the upper panels (910; Scale bar: 10 lm) shows the border of the scratch. Higher magnification (940; Scale bar: 80 lm) images are shown in the lower panels Mol Cell Biochem (2010) 343:191-199 197 findings on the significant role of APN/CD13 in fibroblast motility.",

In normal wound healing, timely apoptosis significantly reduced tissue cellularity and blood supply in early remodeling phase. We believe anti-CD13 antibodies can play a key therapeutic role in reducing wound cellularity by inhibiting fibroblast migration into the wound as well as in reversing high vascularity by blocking migration of endothelial cells [40] . In conclusion, APN/CD13specific antibodies may be used as a therapeutic agent for normalizing fibroblast cellularity and vessel density which are elevated in many fibroproliferative disorders.",
