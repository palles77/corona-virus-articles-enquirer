Increasing amounts of data on immune epitopes are becoming available due to technological advances in epitope-mapping techniques and the availability of genomic information for pathogens. Organizing this data poses a challenge that is similar to the successful effort that was required to organize genomic data, which needed the establishment of centralized databases that complement the primary literature to make the data readily accessible and searchable by researchers. As described in this Innovation article, the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource aims to achieve the same for the more complex and context-dependent information on immune epitopes, and to integrate this data with existing and emerging knowledge resources.",

            "text": "There is a family of such established databases, which includes SwissProt, the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases PubMed, GenBank and Taxonomy Browser (BOX 1) , all of which can claim to be widely used as the major source of information in their domains. Today, researchers are much more likely to retrieve a protein sequence from SwissProt or GenBank, rather than look up these sequences in the primary publication. For new references, such information would not even be found in the primary literature, as it is now mandatory to deposit sequences in a database before publication. Importantly, these knowledge resources can easily be interlinked, making it possible to proceed from a protein sequence to its crystal structure, to its related source organism and to the literature references that describe it. With the emergence and consolidation of new databases, this information will expand to include single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), biomedical imaging and disease association, as well as immune epitope data, such as in the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB), which is the focus of this article. Several databases devoted to immuneepitope-related information have been established before the recently developed IEDB, such as SYFPEITHI 1 , the International ImMunoGeneTics information system (IMGT) 2 , AntiJen 3 , \u03a6\u0399\u039c\u039c 4 , MHCBN 5 and HLA Ligand Database 6 , as well as pathogenspecific resources, such as the HIV database 7 and the HCV database 8 hosted at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, New Mexico, USA (see Further Information for web sites). Clearly, the design of the IEDB 9,10 would not have been possible without this pioneering work of others. The development and application of immuno-informatic databases and tools continues to be a very active and exciting field of research, as evidenced by two recent reviews of the field 11, 12 . Although the focus of this Innovation article is on the IEDB, we want to acknowledge that its success is based and is dependent on contributions of a much larger scientific community.",

The complexity of the data captured in the IEDB makes it difficult to ensure consistent annotation of the data by curators and accurate interpretation of the data by users.

Developing a complete ontology requires exhaustive information on the kinds of data present in the knowledge domain. The gathering of such data must be done in a formal way, again requiring an ontology. To escape an infinite loop, it is necessary to start with an incomplete ontology that is updated over time as deficiencies become apparent as more data are collected. This is what we have done by creating the first version of an ontology of immune epitopes 17 , which is now progressing towards a more formal ontology (FIG. 1) .

Nevertheless, we believe that this field will have a dramatic impact in immunobioinformatics and systems biology 22 . The field originates from the need to automate the extraction of meaning from massive amounts of text. Several of the pioneering data-mining applications were developed for non-biological purposes, such as security projects sponsored by various intelligence agencies, and for the purpose of mining data in patent applications. Over the years the field has become increasingly sophisticated. The basic premise is that of a program that scans through text and extracts data in a defined form (that is, a format that can be recognized by a computer, placed in a correct ontological format, and used by a database). In its basic, but already highly useful, form, a text is classified into one of several categories. For the IEDB, we are using such categorizations to identify abstracts listed in the PubMed database that probably contain epitoperelated information -a similar approach to that which has been successfully applied by others 23, 24 .",

The lack of available training sets has been a significant stumbling block in progressive training towards accomplishing more complex tasks. However, the IEDB curation may offer an opportunity to make advances in the field, because thousands of different manuscripts are being curated.

The IEDB provides several tools to predict peptide binding to MHC class I molecules, and these were recently compared to the large set of tools that are available elsewhere on the internet 27 . Such a large-scale comparison is meant to inform tool users of the current state of the art. For tool developers, this comparison provides a set of benchmark data with which to evaluate newly developed tools against, and it instructs them on which approaches have proven to be successful. In combination with predicting the ability of a particular peptide sequence to bind MHC class I molecules, predictions of its processing by the proteasome and transport by the transporter associated with antigen processing are also made available. These can be used to further narrow the set of candidate T-cell epitopes from a protein sequence. There is an ongoing formal evaluation of these tools that takes advantage of the data collected in the IEDB, as well as an evaluation of MHC-class-II-binding predictions. In addition to evaluations of existing servers, we also plan to hold prediction contests in which interested scientists can submit their predictions for a set of targets. Such contests have had a tremendous positive impact in the evaluation and prediction of protein structure 28 . Figure 1 | Generating a formal ontology for the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB). The initial ontology of the IEDB described all elements of the database as classes with associated characteristics (left panel shows this for the immunogen class). In the development process towards a formal ontology, these elements are placed in a hierarchy (simplified view depicted on the right), in which relationships between the different classes are made explicit. For example, the previously separate and unconnected classes Antigen, Immunogen and Adjuvant are now recognized as being objects (for example, Proteins), which participate in a certain role (as Immunogens) in a specific process (such as Immunization). Compared with the T-cell-epitope predictions, the state of antibody-epitope predictions is widely considered to be suboptimal 29 . In a recent workshop sponsored by the NIAID that brought together many experts from the antibody-epitope-prediction community, this concern was widely shared, and the steps needed to improve this situation were discussed 30 . There was wide agreement that the field could greatly benefit from community-assembled datasets that clarify what types of epitope should be included in an evaluation and that this should be dependent on the intended use of a prediction. Similarly, the metrics used to quantify the success of predictions should be commonly agreed on for a better comparison between different studies. This effort to establish community-accepted datasets and metrics will aid in the acceptance of a newly emerging second generation of antibody-epitope prediction tools, many of which take advantage of the three-dimensional structures that are available for antibody-antigen binding. Three steps in an advanced query for B-cell epitopes are illustrated. First, criteria are specified to query for epitopes that are recognized in mice, where the immunogen applied was the epitope source species and the species is selected to be severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (a). On submitting this query, a summary of epitope records matching these criteria are displayed (b). This includes information on the curated reference, epitope structure, epitope source, and assay used. When choosing the 'Details' link for a specific epitope, the complete curated information is displayed (c). ",

Figure 3 | Homology mapping of an epitope into its three-dimensional source protein structure. For a given epitope and its source protein, the homology tool of the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource identifies homologous proteins with known three-dimensional structures, and maps the location of epitopes in these structures. In this example, the peptide NTNSGPDDQIGYYRRATR (shown in blue), which is recognized by antibodies from mice immunized with inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 34 , is mapped to an X-ray structure of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. The arrow indicates a section of the epitope that is exposed at the surface of the virus, making it a candidate binding site for the antibody in the native protein structure.",

Several interesting, highly conserved epitopes were identified by this analysis. At the same time, the analysis can be used to probe for potential gaps in our knowledge relating to influenza-virus epitopes. Indeed, significant gaps in the current knowledge were revealed, including a paucity of antibody epitopes in comparison to T-cell epitopes (FIG. 4) , a limited number of epitopes reported for avian influenza virus strains and/or subtypes, and a limited number of epitopes reported from proteins other than haemagglutinin and nucleocapsid protein. These gaps in our collective knowledge should inspire directions for further study of immunity against the influenza A virus.",

The issues and solutions to the challenges that have been encountered in the development of this project are of relevance in the context of the general trend of initiatives that are aimed at collecting and displaying large amounts of data of genomic and proteomic origin, and in the context of host-pathogen interactions in general. The initial phase of building and starting Additional tools are provided to analyse already-identified responses. The conservancy tool (Epitope Conservancy Analysis) of the IEDB calculates the level of sequence identity with which a set of epitopes occurs across different strains of a pathogen. The population-coverage tool (Population Coverage Calculation) estimates the frequencies of responses to a set of T-cell epitopes with known MHC restrictions in different sets of populations with known MHC allele frequencies 31 . Finally, the epitope-homology mapping tool (Homology Mapping) visualizes the location of epitopes within the threedimensional structure of their source antigen using a customized epitope viewer 32 . This mapping is done through a screening of available structures in the PDB, from which proteins are selected that closely resemble the epitope source antigen and specifically conserve the sequence of the epitope itself (FIG. 3) .",

The analysis revealed over 600 different influenza virus epitopes, derived from 58 different strains and 10 viral proteins. As all the data are freely available online, this effort translates into a single resource for researchers that allows access to most existing epitope data for influenza virus. For example, because of the capacity to extract data related to specific contexts, an interested scientist can selectively view epitopes that are known to be associated with protection from challenge with influenza virus. By the use of to populate the database with epitope information is completed. The focus now is on enhancing the value of this information to the user community.
