It is now accepted that it will take decades to eliminate the H5N1 virus in poultry and 'unconventional' response approaches have been called for. Drawing on increased understandings of the epizoosis over the last 10 years, this paper investigates what conditions are required if such innovative approaches are to be generated. It argues that addressing the spread and persistence of avian influenza is primarily a political matter, and if approaches appropriate for enzooticity are to be devised, the social, political, and economic dynamics of the disease and responses to it need to be identified and prioritised. A dominant response strategy focused on outbreak events, containment and eradication has obscured these important dynamics. If innovative 'unconventional' responses are to be generated, a wider range of perspectives and expertise needs to be engaged. This will result in political processes of negotiation, which the technically led, development-orientated institutions directing and funding the global response are ill-equipped to facilitate.",

Over the last 10 years there have been a large number of outbreaks, many unreported, and hundreds of millions of poultry birds have died of the disease or through culling to prevent its spread (Alexander 2007; Alexander and Brown 2009; Kawaoka 2012) . In 2012, human H5N1 cases continue to be reported from Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam, countries which are either enzootically infected, or have land borders with one (WHO 2012). Sporadic and more persistent spread extends from these areas to Japan and the Koreas eastwards, and to Europe and the Mediterranean westwards (Dubey et al. 2012; Marinova-Petkova et al. 2012; Sakoda et al. 2012) . A deadly human influenza pandemic involving H5N1 therefore remains possible, although international concern and funding is falling.",

Membership of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and avian influenza control are correlated ). These conventional disease control methods, designed by and for economically developed countries, are encapsulated in the World Organisation for Animal Health's (OIE) codes, standards, decisions and guidelines (cf. OIE 2012) . Underlying them is a set of medicalised 'outbreak' narratives focused on contamination, containment, and eradication (Rosenberg 1992; Scoones and Forster 2008; Wald 2008) , a framing which has resonated with national health security concerns and media interests in the developed world. From 2003, when the virus reappeared in southeast Asia, to around 2008, the response to avian influenza was consequently cast as a global emergency, and in the wake of a deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) emanating from Hong Kong in 2002-2003, manifested in significant international efforts focused on affected geographical areas, which have cost around US$1 billion annually (UNSIC/World Bank 2010). This response has reflected high income country approaches, emphasising disease surveillance, wide area and local culling, vaccination, biosecurity on farms and in supply chains, and behaviour change communications.",

            "text": "As enzooticity in six countries demonstrates, this approach has had limited success and 'unconventional' approaches to designing and implementing responses have been called for (Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] 2011, xi) . This paper draws on improved understandings of the epizoosis over the last 10 years to investigate how such innovative approaches might be generated. Accepting that approaches developed in economically advanced countries have proved difficult to replicate with any sustained success in poorer regions, the paper argues that social, economic, and political factors have been primary in disease persistence, and many aspects of its spread, and that these dynamics have been occluded by technically orientated, emergency responses which have focused on disease outbreaks rather than their underlying causes. In order to respond more effectively to avian influenza, it is necessary not only to examine and take into account the dynamic biology of the virus, and the wider ecological systems in which it is in action, but also the social, economic and political environments in which the pathogen and responses to it land. Doubtlessly a reframing is required in order to provide more holistic understandings and increased space for interdisciplinary approaches, but I argue that in embracing the commonalities of human and animal health, 'One health' concepts that consider health as an outcome of social-ecological systems, and related concerns regarding animal husbandry economics, cultural practices, and the environment (Wilkinson et al. 2011; Zinsstag et al. 2011; Sims and Peiris 2012; Zinsstag et al. 2012) , political dynamics, and in particular the negotiations intrinsic to the uncertainty inherent in the virus, the disease, and responses to them, need to be recognised and prioritised. Similarly, if more networked, locally embedded arrangements are to be developed, which will necessarily involve wider expertise (Scoones 2010a), diverse forms knowledge will need to engage (Parkes 2011) , and political negotiations to find balances between differing goals and interests will be inevitable.",

Here potent national level political factors include the livelihoods of poor people, commercial agribusiness concerns, and the state of relations between people and their governments. Internationally, the health security and economic concerns of wealthy nations are also relevant, as are current shifts in global economic power and related conceptions of development. The paper next considers the current configuration of institutions and expertise arranged in response to avian influenza, and finds it ill-equipped to address or engage with the negotiations that are inherent in processes associated with formulating any 'unconventional' responses. In conclusion the paper suggests that it is only by adopting more open and participatory approaches, which encourage rather than suppress negotiation and debate, that any innovative responses will be generated, and that such plural, negotiated approaches offer further benefits related to equity, sustainability, democratic accountability, and managing uncertainty.",

In Vietnam in 2003, official announcements were delayed so as to not disrupt the imminent Southeast Asian Games (Greenfeld 2004) , and in Thailand, which was then exporting chicken meat worth US$1.3 billion annually, a diplomatic row erupted in early 2004 when H5N1 infection was officially declared just days after a senior European Union official had been assured that there was no infection in the country (Safman 2009). In Indonesia, H5N1 avian influenza was laboratory-confirmed in October 2003, but the government made no announcement until forced to by neighbouring countries' trade bans and media pressure in January 2004 (Setiogi 2004) .",

Yet in the field, and at national and international levels, surveillance efforts have been persistently frustrated by political dynamics. In the field, concerns regarding stigma, neighbourly relations, and commerce echo those related to international trade mentioned above, and surveillance is most challenged by the reluctance of many farmers to report unless timely compensation for any subsequent culling is assured, a process which creates manifold complexities associated with disbursement, reimbursement, and moral hazard. Further along commercial supply chains, through traders and marketeers, and even to financial stock markets, news of outbreaks is also suppressed in order to prevent adverse consumer reactions and reduced consumption (Charnoz and Forster 2011) .",

Any diagnosis of H5N1 infection therefore requires confirmation by a validated test to detect the virus or its genome which can slow detection and subsequent response actions. With any effective culling or movement controls dependent on early detection, and vaccination campaigns requiring continuing detailed viral surveillance (Domenech et al. 2009; Swayne et al. 2011) , the political and economic dynamics suppressing reporting in the field have adversely affected all three major technical elements of a conventional response.",

In some cases, governments have little authority to set or implement credible policy. In Indonesia, for example, small poultry farmers have experience of a catalogue of misguided government interventions dating back over 40 years (Rusastra et al. 1988; Yusdja 1996; Yusdja et al. 2004) , and particularly in the context of rising democracy, unpopular centrally determined interventions have been regularly challenged or ignored. In Thailand, as discussed above, policy was unduly influenced by business interests. In other cases, governments can ignore popular opinion and enforce ineffective policies. Few Vietnamese farmers, for example, have been consulted on any policies or plans, and have been coerced into compliance with inappropriate vaccination and culling programmes (Vu 2009). More prosaically, low commitment from some governments is understandable. Many lower income countries face more immediate and dangerous health threats than avian influenza, and building the veterinary, animal production, and laboratory infrastructures required for any effective surveillance and response systems are long-term, politically unrewarding processes.",

These are particularly potent in the case of avian influenza as a result of the mingling of national security concerns and more normative, development-orientated, global public health agendas. Given the human pandemic potential of the virus, and the potential economic effects of such an event, avian influenza surveillance and response efforts are easily perceived as designed primarily to benefit wealthy nations (Calain 2007a, b) . Indonesia's withholding of human H5N1 virus samples between 2007 and 2009, claiming that they would be used to make vaccines unaffordable to Indonesia, made plain the nature, scale, and importance of possible contestations (Fidler 2007 (Fidler , 2008 (Fidler , 2010 Sedyaningsih et al. 2008; Elbe 2010) . As global economic orders reconfigure, novel conceptions of international relations and development are emerging, remote from existing centre-periphery models (Appadurai 1996; Sivaramakrishnan and Agrawal 2003; Sassen 2007) , and beyond responding to avian influenza, global authority is increasingly fragile, and increasingly subject to negotiation, even given widespread implementation of the 2005 International Health Regulations.",

In these circumstances, the current science-based configuration of the response, which is based on rationalist, reductiveaggregate approaches to risk management, is insufficient (Stirling and Scoones 2009) . A risk management-based approach to surveillance, response planning, and disease control that depends on expert authorities assessing hazards, devising rational management strategies, and communicating with lay publics, fails in the face of the uncertainties that the virus and the disease present, and the ignorance that persists regarding aspects of both. Treating ignorance and uncertainty as risk, however, is not just an inadequate response to incomplete knowledge. Such processes also narrow response and policy options, limit the possibility of democratic engagement, and make scientific advice vulnerable to unacknowledged political dynamics (Stirling 2010) . Professionally, institutionally, and culturally, then, the current configuration of the response is not just ill-equipped to foster or broker innovative, unconventional approaches, but actually inhibits their development.",

First, it is evident that if increasingly prosperous and urbanised populations are to consume increasing amounts of poultry, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses such as H5N1 will present us not just with a long-term problem, but a permanent one. Low pathogenicity avian viruses circulate widely in aquatic wild birds and poultry, and some H5 and H7 low pathogenicity viruses have the potential to mutate to highly pathogenic ones. Furthermore, as the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic demonstrated, avian viruses and swine viruses, which are subject to the same drivers of increased meat consumption and mixed farming systems, have a lively affinity. The influenza virus-in birds, pigs and humans-is therefore unlikely ever to be eradicated. No 'control at source' is possible. The best we can do is to learn to co-exist.",

A science-based, technically driven response doubtlessly is effective in some places-the wealthier, more industrialised nations where it was devised-but the sheer variety of its consequences and effects in different social, economic, and political terrains, along with its variegated and in some cases misappropriated manifestations, suggest that a 'one-size-fits-all' approach is insufficient, and that enforcing such an approach is unlikely to be effective, and may even be counter-productive.",

It is only by encouraging debate that any 'unconventional' responses will be generated. The benefits of allowing plural, self-determined responses go beyond fostering innovation and the sustainability that accompanies democratic engagement. Accepting, or at least considering, a wider range of viewpoints reduces uncertainty. Surprises are still possible, but if as many options as possible have been considered, surprises are less likely, and in the wake of wide-ranging and open consultations, unpleasant surprises are less politically catastrophic. A more open, participatory stance also increases accountability and makes more explicit the social dynamics and political pressures acting on, and among, scientific policy advice. Opening up rather than closing down negotiations around alternative and complementary responses also brings into focus the distributive effects of any interventions. By considering who gains and who loses as a result of any interventions, or the lack of them, more equitable, and therefore more sustainable, responses can be devised.",

If it is not recognised that science presents just one of many perspectives, a dangerous rigidity ensues: alternative ways of understanding are ignored, suppressed or obscured, and iterative processes of deliberation and learning, which are essential for coping with such uncertain and dynamic circumstances as those involving an influenza virus, are precluded.",
