These instruments range from the established formal multilateral organizations of the United Nations to the newer restricted-membership institutions of the Group of Eight (G8). To decide where best to deploy scarce resources, we must systematically examine the G8's contributions to global health governance. This assessment explores the contributions made by multilateral institutions such as the World Health Organization, and whether Member States comply with their commitments. We assessed whether G8 health governance assists its member governments in managing domestic politics and policy, in defining dominant normative directions, in developing and complying with collective commitments and in developing new G8-centred institutions. We found that the G8's performance improved substantially during the past decade. The G8 Member States function equally well, and each is able to combat diseases. Compliance varied among G8 Member States with respect to their health commitments, and there is scope for improvement. G8 leaders should better define their health commitments and set a one-year deadline for their delivery. In addition, Member States must seek WHO's support and set up an institution for G8 health ministers.",

            "text": "How can international institutions encourage their member governments to commit to and comply with actions to improve global public health? This question is important for health policymakers, who now have a diverse array of institutional instruments to choose from when allotting scarce resources to achieve their goals. At the international level, governments still use long-established, functionally focused, ministerial-guided multilateral organizations such as the World Health Organization and other organizations of the United Nations system. 1 However, governments increasingly have access to newer, informal, summit-delivered plurilateral institutions, most notably those of the Group of Eight (G8). 2 Since 1996 the G8 has given particular attention to health issues, for example at its annual summit in St Petersburg in 2006. 3 Health policy-makers need to know which international institutions to rely upon. In addition, these organizations need to work together more effectively, as mutual reinforcers rather than rivals, in order to meet global health needs. For the purposes of this paper, health encompasses all references to public health, human health and wellbeing, ageing, infectious disease, healthrelated international organizations and initiatives, drug use, drug conventions, pharmaceuticals, medications, potable water, biotechnology and the impact of bio-terrorism on human health.",

            "text": "To assess the contribution of the newer G8 summit-centred system, it is important to ask whether attention from the leaders of the most powerful countries actually makes a difference to the health of people around the world. This question has given rise to a broad debate. 4 Critics argue that the G8 has failed in terms of fundraising, and has been unable to raise the large amounts of money needed to combat human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and other diseases. In addition, the old UN system organizations have been unable to induce their own members to provide the necessary funds. 5, 6 Other critics argue that the G8 has done too much of the wrong thing. They claim that its members remain attached to neo-liberal principles that are vital to improving health, and thus display \"fatal indifference\" to new patterns of disease. 7-10 Still different critics claim that the G8 fails to deliver on health because it is easily distracted by other issues, has a narrow audience and places a premium on short-term public relations success. [11] [12] [13] Those who are supportive of the G8, however, argue that the G8 is emerging as the global-health governor. This is not out of choice, but as a consequence of the poor performance of the old multilateral organizations and the high technical and economic capacity of G8 members. 14, 15 Other supporters view the G8 as a potential leader in the health field as a whole, and claim that the G8 is already forging a new path for global health governance in an era in which globalized markets threaten to overwhelm Member States. 16 Commentators have described the G8 as the emerging centre of 21st century global health governance. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] This is because of the inclusive, multistakeholder model on which the G8 is now based, and stems from the identified need for task-oriented collaboration between the private and public sectors as the model for future global health governance. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] To advance this debate, we car-ried out an evidence-based assessment of G8 health governance and explored its impact on foreign policy and the domestic behaviour of G8 Member States. These include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, the United States and the European Union (EU). 2 Drawing on the concert equality model that uses six governance functions to explain institutional performance, we will first assess the G8's performance with respect to its health commitments. These six functions are: supporting the domestic management of policies and politics; deliberating on key issues; defining new directions and future commitments; taking collective decisions about specific commitments; delivering these decisions through members' compliance with their commitments; and developing global governance by creating new and directing existing international institutions. We examine whether G8 members comply with their collective commitments, and why. We explore whether G8 leaders, through their active use of compliance catalysts, plurilateral institutions and multilateral organizations, can work to ensure greater compliance with global health goals.",

            "text": "Since the onset of rapid globalization in 1996, the G8 has emerged as a more effective leader of global health governance than other existing institutions (see Table 1 ). [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] In relation to its first function of domestic political management, the Group of Seven (G7), then without the Russian Federation, initially took up health issues that concerned the Member States at that time, such as cancer. The G7's concerns subsequently gravitated towards diseases, such as malaria, that primarily affect countries outside of the G7. When the Russian Federation became a full member in 1998, the G8 began to focus on HIV/ AIDS, which was becoming increasingly prevalent within that country. As hosts of the 2006 St Petersburg Summit, the Russian Federation's choice of infectious disease as one of three priority themes was driven by concern that the epicentre of HIV/AIDS was migrating from Africa to Eurasia, and it sought to address the issue of HIV/AIDS within its own borders. A poll taken on the summit's eve identified infectious dis-ease as a key issue, voted for by 84% of Russian respondents and 86% of those in the G8, and giving the topic second priority after terrorism. 28 The second function of the G8 is deliberation, in which outcomes are measured by the number of paragraphs devoted to health topics in summit declarations issued in the leaders' names. Compliance with these commitments, the fifth function of G8 Member States, involves the actual implementation of these collective decisions. In this respect, however, performances by G8 Member States have varied. On this issue the best systematic evidence comes from the G8 Research Group's annual assessment of members' compliance with critical commitments in the year following the summit. The role of the G8 Research Group is to assess the actions taken by member governments, including verbal reaffirmations, assigning personnel and resources, initiating new programmes and documenting whether the commitments result in their intended effect. 29 First-order compliance is measured on a scale from -100% to +100%. Minus 100% represents no action or a Member State acting against fulfilling the commitment; +100% represents complete compliance with it. Compliance with the critical health commitments made at the Summits hosted by Japan in 2000 and France in 2003 was very high, but it has been considerably lower in other years.",

Older organizations within the UN system, led by WHO, have proven increasingly ineffective in mobilizing their members' resources on the scale required and in meeting targets and timetables. 5, 14, 15 By contrast, the G8 Member States possess the globally predominant and specialized capabilities needed to combat these new diseases worldwide. Their core, common, G8-grounded principles of open democracy and social advance bring G8 leaders close to their newly democratic African partners, who are more comfortable with the multi-stakeholder approaches required to combat a new generation of diseases.

Although the concert equality model explains G8 performance on the other five functions of G8 governance, variation in performance on compliance is difficult to explain. 3, 30, 33 Recent research exploring G8 finance and development commitments suggests that compliance is linked to three factors: the conscious action of the G8 leaders as active agents at summits, the reinforcing action of the G8 ministerial institution, and the vulnerabilities and relative capabilities that constitute the structure of the international system. 48 Is the same true in the field of health? Health is a much newer focus of the G8, and at present no G8 ministeriallevel institution deals exclusively with health issues. As active agents, G8 leaders at times consciously embed within their commitments expressions of their political will. Particular catalysts provide specific guidance about how to deliver their commitments. A recent analysis of compliance with 46 of the G8's finance and development commitments from 1996 to 2005 found that two catalysts improved compliance. These were priority placement, whereby reference is made to health in the communiqu\u00e9 chapeau, introduction, preamble or Chair's Summary, and timetable, where a specific target date or year is set. However, no improvements were seen from the other catalysts, which included: targets (specific, numerical, measurable goals); remit mandates (requirements to report back at the next summit); money mobilized (new money promised at the summit);",

The timetable catalyst was divided into one-year variants and multiyear variants. International institutions were divided into WHO, the most functionally relevant multilateral organization, and \"other\". The commitment was coded as WHO when it contained a specific reference to this organization. All referenced multilateral institutional initiatives not exclusively directed by WHO, including references to the UN, the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative and the Stop TB Partnership, were coded as other because they are partly directed by other organizations. The category \"past promise\", a reaffirmation of a commitment made in a previous year, was added to capture the important impact of iteration and continuity. 49 Between 1996 and 2006 a health commitment contained up to four such catalysts and as few as none (see Table 3 ; available at http://www.who.int/bulletin). The most frequently employed catalysts across the 30 measured health commitments were, in decreasing order: priority placement (12 commitments), specified agent (10), other international institution (8), money mobilized (7), past promise (7), multiyear timetable (6), one-year timetable (4) and G8 body (4) .",

The presence of a specific timetable of one year or less tended to increase compliance with that commitment by an average of +0.65 compliance points, over and above the baseline value of average compliance with commitments without such a timetable (p-value=0.03; t-value=2.219). Similarly, delegating some responsibility for implementation to WHO tended to improve compliance with that commitment by +0.55 compliance points, in comparison to compliance with commitments not delegated to WHO (p-value=0.06; t-value=1.93). Although significant only at the 94% confidence interval level, the estimate is considered to be admissible given the small sample size. 53 To identify more specifically why compliance differs from the overall level of compliance across all commitments in a given year, we calculated a mean-adjusted compliance variable from each individual commitment compliance score. In this analysis the only significant variables that emerged were international institution and \"other\". However, by delegating some responsibility for implementation to an international organization other than WHO, compliance tended to reduce by 5.9 compliance points relative to the baseline average compliance with commitments where this catalyst variable was absent (p-value=0.07; t-value=1.83).",

Il s'agit aussi bien d'organisations multilat\u00e9rales bien \u00e9tablies du syst\u00e8me des Nations Unies, que d'institutions plus r\u00e9centes et \u00e0 composition plus restreinte, mises sur pied dans le cadre du G8. Pour d\u00e9ployer au mieux les ressources limit\u00e9es dont on dispose, il importe d'examiner syst\u00e9matiquement la contribution apport\u00e9e par le G8 \u00e0 la gouvernance sanitaire mondiale. Cette \u00e9valuation examine les contributions des organisations multilat\u00e9rales comme l'Organisation mondiale de la Sant\u00e9 et d\u00e9termine si les Etats Membres respectent leurs engagements. L'\u00e9tude a cherch\u00e9 \u00e0 v\u00e9rifier dans quelle mesure la gouvernance sanitaire du G8 aide les gouvernements des pays membres \u00e0 g\u00e9rer les politiques au plan interne, \u00e0 d\u00e9finir les principales orientations normatives, \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper et \u00e0 respecter des engagements pris \u00e0 titre collectif et \u00e0 mettre sur pied de nouvelles institutions rattach\u00e9es au G8. L'\u00e9tude a permis de constater que les r\u00e9sultats obtenus par le G8 s'\u00e9taient sensiblement am\u00e9lior\u00e9s au cours des dix derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Les r\u00e9sultats sont \u00e9galement satisfaisants au niveau des diff\u00e9rents Etats Membres du G8, chacun se r\u00e9v\u00e9lant en mesure de lutter contre les maladies. Le respect des engagements dans le domaine sanitaire varie cependant d'un Etat \u00e0 l'autre, et des am\u00e9liorations peuvent encore \u00eatre apport\u00e9es. Ainsi, les dirigeants du G8 devraient mieux d\u00e9finir leurs engagements en mati\u00e8re de sant\u00e9 et se fixer un d\u00e9lai d'une ann\u00e9e pour les honorer. En outre, les Etats Membres devraient demander l'appui de l'OMS et cr\u00e9er un organisme regroupant les ministres de la sant\u00e9 des pays du G8.",

Esos instrumentos van desde las organizaciones multilaterales oficiales de las Naciones Unidas hasta instituciones m\u00e1s recientes y restringidas del Grupo de los Ocho (G8). Para decidir la mejor forma de emplear recursos escasos, debemos examinar de forma sistem\u00e1tica las contribuciones del G8 a la gobernanza de la salud mundial. En este estudio exploramos las contribuciones hechas por las instituciones multilaterales, tales como la Organizaci\u00f3n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) e investigamos si los Estados Miembros cumplen sus compromisos. Hemos analizado si la gobernanza sanitaria del G8 ayuda a sus gobiernos miembros a gestionar la pol\u00edtica y las Resumen An\u00e1lisis del cumplimiento de los compromisos de los l\u00edderes del G8 en materia de salud (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) pol\u00edticas nacionales, a definir las principales direcciones normativas, a desarrollar y cumplir los compromisos colectivos y a crear nuevas instituciones centradas en el G8. Hemos verificado que el desempe\u00f1o del G8 ha mejorado considerablemente en el \u00faltimo decenio. Los Estados Miembros del G8 funcionan igualmente bien, y todos ellos son capaces de luchar contra las enfermedades. El cumplimiento de sus compromisos sanitarios fue variable entre los Estados Miembros del G8, y este aspecto es mejorable. Los l\u00edderes del G8 deben definir mejor sus compromisos sanitarios y fijar plazos anuales para su cumplimiento. Adem\u00e1s, los Estados Miembros deben buscar el apoyo de la OMS y crear una instituci\u00f3n formada por los ministros de salud del G8).",
