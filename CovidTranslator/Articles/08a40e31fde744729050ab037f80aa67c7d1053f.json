According to the data of the number of infected people in Israel, published by the Israeli Ministry of Health, the transmission rate would be higher, \u03b2=0.22, or R0=5.7, which is unlikely. The main reason for the discrepancy is that the number of infected people in Israel includes imported cases. As all subjects coming to Israel from abroad are isolated, in the model we did not include imported cases. Case fatality rates vary between different countries ranging from 7.2% in Italy to 0.2% in Germany (14) . Thus, for the rate of death ( ) in our basic model we considered a moderate estimate of 2.6% or 0.001 per day over 26 days of infection.

An alternative strategy of \"trace, isolate, test and treat approach\" (strategy 2) in which only individuals who are defined as being at highrisk for being exposed are isolated (relaxed isolation) and repeatedly tested will result in a total of 16,658 infected people with 432 deaths. Overall, strategy 1 is expected to save ~43 more lives, but with a cost of $102,383,282 to prevent one case of death, compared to a more focused approach. As usual ICER in cost-effectiveness analyses relates to cost per Quality-adjusted life year (QALY), and in our study the ICER was measured as cost per one avoided death, we suggest an easy transformation from the ICER in this study to the conventional ICER in cost-effectiveness analyses. Assuming that one case of death is equivalent to a loss of 10 QALYs, the ICER would be $102,383,282 divided by 10, resulting in $10.2 million per QALY.

This is the rationale underlying the efforts to \"flatten the curve\" thereby avoiding a narrow and high peak of infected patients that is necessarily accompanied by a substantial number of patients in severe condition. According to our model, a strategy of avoiding any active step to contain the virus will result in an unacceptable number of infected people (7.65 million) and an extremely high death rate (~200,000 people), and therefore is not realistic. In contrast, the difference in the peak number of infected patients between the two main strategies tested is ~360 patients, in favor of strategy 1.",
