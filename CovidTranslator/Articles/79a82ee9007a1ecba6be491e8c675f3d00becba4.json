The S protein fragment was purified from the culture supernatant of stably transformed HEK293T cells secreting a tagged version of the protein. The vaccine was given subcutaneously to 129S6/SvEv mice in saline, with alum adjuvant or with alum plus CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN). Mice immunized with the adjuvanted antigen elicited strong antibody and cellular immune responses; furthermore, adding the CpG ODN to the alum resulted in increased IgG2a antibody titers and a higher number of INF-\u2425-secreting murine splenocytes. Mice vaccinated with S318-510 deglycosylated by PNGase F (dgS318-510) showed a lower neutralizing antibody response but had similar numbers of INF-\u2425-producing cells in the spleen. This finding suggests that carbohydrate is important for the immunogenicity of the S318-510 protein fragment and provide useful information for designing an effective and safe SARS subunit vaccine.",

This newly emerging infectious disease quickly spread to 29 countries on five continents along international air travel routes, causing large-scale outbreaks in Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto in early 2003. The World Health Organization (WHO) issued a global alert for SARS on 12 March 2003 . With the support of the WHO, authorities in affected regions implemented epidemiologic surveillance and adherence to infection-control procedures, which helped contain the SARS outbreak by mid-July 2003. However, a total of 8096 SARS cases and 774 associated deaths were reported in the interim [1] .",

All predicted open reading frames (ORFs) are divided into two groups: (i) those with a clear homology to other coronaviruses and for which viral functions are proposed (such ORFs include the replicase and the structural genes) and (ii) those with no clear homology to any known genes and often referred to as group-specific genes [4] .",

This protein is responsible for binding to receptors on host cells and plays an important role in membrane fusion [6] . The main receptor for SARS-CoV is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [7] , and it has been shown that amino acids 318-510 of the SARS-CoV S protein are sufficient to bind to ACE2 [8, 9] . The S protein is an attractive target for both therapeutics and vaccine development because monoclonal antibodies to the S protein can neutralize SARS-CoV infection [10, 11] . Moreover, the S protein has been shown to induce serum neutralizing antibodies and confer protective immunity against SARS-CoV challenge [12] [13] [14] .",

Several potential strategies can be considered for vaccination against SARS-CoV, including a whole-killed virus vaccine, a viral vectored vaccine, a recombinant subunit vaccine and DNAbased vaccines [15, 16] . We have previously reported on the development of two SARS vaccine candidates, a whole-killed virus and two adenovirus-based vectors consisting of the SARS-CoV S and N proteins that induce serum neutralizing antibodies and inhibit pulmonary SARS-CoV replication [17] . In this report, we describe a third candidate a SARS-CoV subunit vaccine comprised of residues 318-510 of the S protein (S318-510) produced in a bioreactor-based mammalian cell expression system. The protein was formulated with different adjuvants and evaluated for its immunogenicity in a murine model, in both its fully glycosylated form and after deglycosylation (dgS318-510) by PNGase F.",

HEK293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method and a bulk culture resistant to puromycin (5 g/ml) was expanded and the media assayed for secreted protein levels by Western blot analysis using an anti PrA antibody (Sigma). Production of the PrA-S318-510 fusion protein was scaled-up from these adherent cells in a 2.2 l New Brunswick Celligen bioreactor using 25 g of Fibra-Cel disks (New Brunswick Scientific). The bioreactor was run in perfusion mode using CHO-S-SFM II media (Gibco) supplemented with 3% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2.25 g/l glucose, 1\u00d7 non essential amino acids (Gibco), 1 mg/l aprotinin (Bioshop, Burlington, Ontario), 5 mg/l puromycin (Bioshop, Burlington, Ontario) and 1\u00d7 penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco) at a flow rate of about 3 l/day. The harvested media was concentrated 10-fold and the fusion protein was purified by IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) affinity chromatography. The PrA-S318-510 fusion protein was then digested by TEV protease at a ratio of 6:1 (w/w) at 4 \u2022 C for 18 h to remove the N-terminal PrA fusion tag. As a result of the cloning strategy and TEV protease cleavage the resulting protein fragment contains four additional amino acids (GGRP) at the N-terminus of the S318-510 fragment. S318-510 was further purified by HiTrap phenyl hydrophobic interaction chromatography, HiTrap Q anion exchange chromatography and Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). A portion of the purified S318-510 was deglycosylated by PNGase F digestion at a ratio of 10:1 (w/w) at 37 \u2022 C for 21 h and again purified by Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography. Following gel filtration both the naturally glycosylated (S318-510) and the PNGase F deglycosylated (dgS318-510) samples were dialyzed against phosphate buffer saline (PBS) without CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 and concentrated to 0.5-1.0 mg/ml for injections.",

Alum is the most extensively used adjuvant in commercial vaccines and acts mainly by stimulating Th2-type immune responses [22] . The mechanisms by which alum produces its adjuvant effect include formation of an antigen depot and activation of antigen-presenting cells [23] . In contrast, CpG ODNs bind to the TLR9 receptor and preferentially induce Th1-biased immune responses [24, 25] . Several reports have shown that co-administration of alum with CpG ODN and antigen enhanced the effect of CpG ODN and stimulated both Th1-and Th2-type immune responses [26, 27] . The mechanism for this effect has not been investigated. Our data indicate that CpG ODN 1826 stimulates a Th1-type immune response as evidenced by the increased serum IgG2a titers (Fig. 2B) and INF-\u2425 secretion (Fig. 4) . As for the magnitude of the antibody response, we detected increased total serum SARS-CoV IgG titers after the first injection with CpG ODN, compared to alum adjuvant alone; however, after the second injection the titers were similar ( Fig. 2A and C) . These results suggest that CpG ODN 1826 may only enhance the primary antibody response against the S318-510 antigen or that the level of immunity had reached maximal levels such that further boosting was not possible.",

Furthermore, the S protein fragment developed by He et al.

In other studies [20, 34] a longer polypeptide was produced in insect cells by a recombinant baculovirus, which contrasts with our recombinant protein that was produced in bioreactorbased human cell culture system. A technology based on a human cell line is ideal for large-scale vaccine manufacturing; the strength of the cell line based technology is its safety, scalability and productivity. In addition, protein produced in human cells most closely resembles the natural viral protein, particularly in terms of post-translational modifications.",

However, the SARS-CoV specific total IgG ELISA titers and the virus neutralizing titers were both lower in the sera of dgS318-510 vaccinated mice ( Fig. 2A and  C) . We have also found that the S318-510 vaccinated and dgS318-510 vaccinated (adjuvanted with alum plus CpG ODN) mice showed similar serum IgG antibody levels against the dgS318-510 antigen (Fig. 5) .

This result suggests that common epitopes are present in both S318-510 and dgS318-510 antigens. In contrast, the dgS318-510 vaccinated mice showed higher IgG antibody levels against dgS318-510 than against S318-510. This result suggests that dgS318-510 contains epitopes that are blocked or shielded by carbohydrate in S318-510. Since we observed a decrease in the serum neutralizing titers in the dgS318-510 vaccinated mice, these epitopes presumably do not lead to a neutralizing antibody response. This suggestion is in agreement with the X-ray crystal structure of S318-510 complexed with ACE2, which shows that the three N-linked oligosaccharides are positioned on one face of the S318-510 molecular opposite to that of the ACE2 interaction face [35] . In summary, our data suggest that glycosylation of S318-510 protein is important for vaccination, because it helps to increase the amount of antibodies directed to the virus neutralizing epitopes by shielding the non-neutralizing epitopes.",

This is particularly true for a SARS vaccine since increased disease severity has been observed for a vaccine against feline infectious peritonitis virus (coronavirus) [36] . In addition, synthetic versions of S variants were tested for their sensitivity to antibody neutralization with pseudotyped lentiviruses. In these experiments, antibodies that neutralized most human isolates-derived S proteins enhanced entry mediated by the civet virus S protein [37] . Furthermore, liver inflammation was found in MVA-S vaccinated ferrets after challenge with SARS-CoV [38] ; however, there were no reports of adverse effects from other laboratories working with ferrets or other animals (rodents and monkeys). Since the mouse is not an ideal model for SARS, we did not assess the effect of immunization with the S318-510 protein fragment on disease enhancement. However, the issue of disease enhancement will have to be carefully studied if and when an appropriate animal model becomes available.",
