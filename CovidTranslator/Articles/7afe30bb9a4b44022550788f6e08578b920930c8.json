Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium vivax, and Plasmodium knowlesi are responsible for the spread of malaria, out of which P. falciparum is considered as the most virulent form [1] . According to World Health Organization (WHO) factsheet 2013, out of 3.4 billion people at malarial risk, 1.2 billion are at high risk with more than one case per 1000 people, especially in tropical areas with transmission over 97 countries [2] . In 2012, more than 207 million cases were reported globally with an estimated 6,27,000 deaths; 90% of them occurred in sub-Saharan Africa in which 77% were children under the age of five [3] . Since 2006, artemisininbased combination therapies (ACTs) have been recommended for the treatment of malaria, however, the development of resistance in the recent times to ACT in many parts of Southeast Asian regions is of great concern [4, 5] .",

One of the most potent conjugate displayed an IC 50 value of 6.92 mM against chloroquine resistant (CQ-R) W2 strain of P. falciparum. Further, Raval et al. described the synthesis of tetrahydropyrimidineeisatin hybrids and their in vitro activity against 3D7 strain of P. falciparum [19] . The most potent hybrid exhibited minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.035 mg/mL which was better than the standard CQ (MIC \u00bc 0.125 mg/mL).",

The preparation of stable metal complexes with predictable structures, ability to tune ligand affinities along with efficient biological targeting are the major advantages associated with the synthesis of organometallics [21] . Among all the metals used, ferrocene (Fc) has played a distinctive role in the contemporary medicine because of its unique features including non-toxicity and stability under physiological conditions [22] . The replacement of the organic functionality with Fc has now been recognized as a useful strategy for the development of new and effective drugs viz. anti-androgen nilutamide and ferrocenyl analogs of commercial anti-estrogen tamoxifen displayed higher cytotoxicity against breast and prostate cancer cells respectively in comparison to the reference drugs [23] . Indeed, the most symbolic example of contribution of ferrocene with enhanced biological activity into a drug molecule is that of Ferroquine (FQ); derived from chloroquine (CQ) with ferrocene appended side chain which is 22 times more active than CQ against CQ-R strain of P. falciparum [24] .",

Synthetic chemistry C-5 substituted N-alkylazido-isatins 3 were prepared following our previously reported protocol [28] involving an initial basepromoted alkylation of isatins 1 with dibromoalkanes at 60 C in DMF to yield the corresponding C-5 substituted N-alkylbromoisatins 2. The subsequent treatment of 2 with sodium azide at 60 C resulted in the formation of the desired precursors 3 as depicted in Scheme 1. The precursors' 3 and ethnylferrocene 4 were subsequently utilized in the copper promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction to yield the desired 1H-1,2,3-triazole tethered isatinferrocene conjugates 5 [29] .",

The synthetic precursor viz.
