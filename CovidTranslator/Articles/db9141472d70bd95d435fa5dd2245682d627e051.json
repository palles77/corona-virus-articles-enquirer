Three monoclonal antibodies directed against two distinct epitopes on the E2 glycoprotein of MHV-4 protected mice against lethal virus challenge and converted the infection from fatal encephalomyelitis to demyelination. A single neutralizing antihody directed against a third epitope on E2 as well as seven nonneutralizing antibodies to EZ, El, and N polypeptides did not protect against challenge. In mice which received protective antibody, MHV-4 infection was not blocked, however, virus grew to lower titers in liver and brain, and virus replication in the CNS was more restricted than in unprotected mice. Decreased involvement of neurons in the brains of protected mice was observed, and no evidence of neuronal infection in the spinal cords was found. In contrast, oligodendrocytes were infected in the presence of protective antibody, and evidence of demylination associated with mononuclear cell infiltration was found. These studies demonstrate that antibody to a single epitope on a viral glycoprotein can substantially alter the course and phenotype of disease.",

Fatal encephalitis associated with significant loss of neurons is the normal outcome of intracerebral inoculation, with resistance of mice to fatal disease apparently being controlled by a single autosomal recessive gene (Knobler et al, 1981a) expressed at the level of the neuron and macrophage. Recovery from the acute encephalitis is rare, and the infrequent survivors exhibit demyelination (Lampert et d, 1973; Weiner, 1973) . Haspel and co-workers (1978) a temperature sensitive mutant of MHV-4, designated ts 8, produced demyelination in over 90% of infected mice while producing encephalitis in less than 5%.

El is integrally associated with the membrane in both a nonglycosylated Z&000-Da form and an O-glycosylated 25,000-Da form. E2 consists of two approximately 95,000-Da subunits which form a 180,000-Da dimer constituting the large \"petal\" (peplomer) on the virion envelope (Sturman et al, 1980) . In our laboratory we have raised a library of hybridoma antibodies to these viral proteins to study the biology and biochemistry of MHV and to probe the in vivo events in VimLs neutralization.

Infection of neurons of the CNS results in rapidly lethal encephalitis usually within 6 days. We tested two passive transfer regimens as described under Materials and Methods to attempt to alter the course of this normally lethal encephalitis. Both regimens were effective, and the simpler single antibody dose protocol was adopted. Figure 1 shows the results of one such protection experiment in which we tested five different MAb to the MHV-4 E2 glycoprotein (5B19.2, 5A13.5,5B170.3,4B11.6, and 5B93.9) and as a control, a single antibody to the N protein (4B6.2). Groups of six mice were given 200 ~1 of the indicated ascites on Day-l then challenged intracerebrally with 20 PFU of MHV-4 on Day 0. Survivors were observed daily for 21 days then sacrificed in order to score demyelinating lesions in the spinal cord. Note that mice receiving nonprotective antibody (clones 4B11.6, 5B93.9, and Timing and dose dependence of passive protecticm, The effect of antibody given passively prior to infection might be argued to be simply an in vivo neutralization whereby incoming virus in the challenge inoculum is prevented from infecting targets in the CNS. To test this possibility, we altered the time of antibody transfer relative to challenge. Groups of six mice each were given a single 200-~1 dose of MAb 5B19.2 on Days -1, 0, +l, and +2 relative to virus challenge on Day 0. Mortality was again scored over a 21-day interval. As evident in Fig. 2 , groups of six mice each receiving no antibody or MAb 4B6.2 on Day -1 all died by 6 days after infection as previously observed. In contrast, mice receiving antibody on Days -1, 0, and +l showed 100, 100, and 83% survival, respectively, while 33% of those receiving antibody 2 days after infection survived for 21 days. Thus, the effect of passively transferred antibody is therapeutic and confers protection even if given after the establishment of CNS infection. To examine the quantity of antibody required to protect against lethal challenge, we gave groups of six mice increasing doses of 5B19.2 ascites 1 day prior to ic challenge with MHV-4 then scored mortality as indicated above. Table 2 summarizes the results of a typical experiment. A single dose of 25 ~1 of 5B19.2 ascites with a neutralizing titer of l:lO,OOO protected half of the challenged mice. This dose of ascites in a 25 g mouse is approximately equivalent to a l/ 1000 dilution (1 bl/g).",

Table 3 summarizes these results. We noted that titers in the brains of mice receiving MAb 5B19.2 were reduced by a factor of 20 relative to untreated controls. This reduction was not observed in mice receiving nonprotective antibody to El (5A5.2) or E2 (4B11.6). In the protected mice (group IV, Table 3 ), we were unable to detect virus in the livers at a threshold value of 200 PFU per gram whereas control mice (groups I and III) had greater than 2 X lo4 PFU per gram in their livers on Day 4. To confirm that this difference reflected actual reduction in virus replication and not merely a damping effect due to high concentration of MAb in the liver homogenates, we examined H and E sections as well as fluorescein-stained cryostat sections of livers from protected and unprotected mice. Mice which received no protective MAb showed numerous large necrotic foci of hepatocytes (Fig. 3A) , stained for MHV-4 antigens (Fig. 3B ), but only limited isolated foci of infected cells were observed in sections of livers from mice receiving protective MAb 5B19.2 (Figs. 3C, D). Taken together, these findings indicate that virus replication is substantially decreased by passively administered MAb both in the CNS and peripheral compartments. ET AL. observation of lower virus titers in the brains of protected mice suggested that virus replication was restricted to fewer cells in these animals. To test this, we compared the distribution of MHV antigens in sections of spinal cord among infected and untreated, infected and unprotected, and infected and protected mice. Figure 4 demonstrates peroxidase-labeled MHV antigens in a section from an MHV-l-infected untreated mouse. There are MHV antigens in neuronal cells in the gray matter (Fig.  4A ) as well as in oligodendrocytes with their processes surrounding multiple myelin sheaths in the white matter (Fig. 4B) .",

The observed restriction of virus replication in the neuronal cells but not oligodendrocytes suggests that infection spreads via different mechanisms in these two cell types. Whether this is due to differences in the mode of cell-to-cell spread or reflects distinct receptors for MHV-4 on each cell type is a matter for further study. In addition to the altered virus tropism in the presence of antibody, we found that the characteristics of the demyelinating lesions were changed.

            "text": "Similarly, the repertoire of response to a primary infection may influence the course of subsequent infection by a related virus. Human viral diseases such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (Vandvik, 1973) and progressive rubella panencephalitis (Wolinsky et al, 1976) occur in the presence of high titers of antibody to measles and rubella viruses, respectively. In the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis, there are elevated titers of antibodies to a number of common viruses such as measles, varicella, herpes, and others (Norrby, 19'78) . Although causal relationships between the respective viruses, the presence of these antibodies, and demyelinating disease have not been established, the present model system provides new insight into the po-tential role of selected specific antibodies in leading to host survival from fatal infection, with development of a chronic disease. Finally, this model offers the opportunity to study the factors which govern the infection of and spread within specific populations of CNS cells by MHV-4 at the molecular level.",
