            "text": "CVTree3 is the latest version of an effective web srver for inferring phylogeny from whole genome sequences and comparing the results with systematics at all taxonomic ranks. The alignment-free method based on K-tuple counting and background subtraction was termed a composition vector (CV) approach and the approach is abbreviated as CVTree. It was introduced in 2004 [Qi et al. (2004b) ] with applications to prokaryote phylogeny. The first web server was published in the same year in the Nucleic Acids Research Web Server issue [Qi et al. (2004a) ]. Since then it has been applied to Archaea and Bacteria ; Qi et al. (2004b) ; Sun et al. (2010) ; Zuo et al. (2013 Zuo et al. ( , 2104 ], viruses ; Gao et al. (2003) ], chloroplasts [Yu et al. (2005) ] and fungi [Wang et al. (2009); O'Connell et al. (2012) ; Choi et al. (2013) ]. An essential update of the CVTree web server was published in the 2009 NAR Web Server issue [Xu and Hao (2009) ]. The methodological aspects of the CV approach has been elucidated repeatedly in literature. In particular, the role and choice of the peptide length K was discussed in [Li et al. (2010) ] and [Zuo et al. (2014) ].",

An interactive, collapsible and expandable, CVTree Viewer based on HTML5 has been added to the new web server. These new features enable biologists to study phylogeny inferred from thousands of genomes and to compare the resultis directly with taxonomy at all ranks in an almost automatic manner.",

Second, one may just collect the coding sequences in the genome. Third, one makes use of the translated amino acid sequences from the coding segments of DNA. As mutation rates are higher and more variable in non-coding segments and protein sequences change at a more or less constant rate, one expects that the third choice is the best and the second is better than the first. We tried all three choices and the requirement of consistency served as a criterion. By consistency we mean the topology of the trees constructed with growing K should converge. This is best realized with phylogenetic relations obtained from protein sequences. Therefore, in what follows we concentrate on results based on amino acid sequences.",

Neutral mutations lead to some randomness in the K-string composition. In order to highlight the selective diversification of sequence composition one must subtract a random background from the simple counting results. This is done as follows.Suppose we have done direct counting for all strings of length (K \u22121) and (K \u2212 2). The probability of appearance of K-strings is predicted by using a Markov model: p 0 (a 1 a 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a K ) = p(a 1 a 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a K\u22121 )p(a 2 a 3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a K ) p(a 2 a 3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a K\u22121 )The superscript 0 on p 0 indicates the fact that it is a predicted quantity. We note that the denominator comes from the frequency of (K \u2212 2)-strings. This kind of Markov model prediction has been used in biological sequence analysis since long [Brendel et al. (1986) ]. It can be justified by virtue of a maximal entropy principle with appropriate constraints [Hu and Wang (2001) ].",

To further simplify the notations, we write a i for the i-th component corresponding to the string type i, where i runs from 1 to N = 20 K . Putting these components in a fixed order, we obtain a composition vector for the species A:A = (a 1 , a 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , a N )Likewise, for the species B we have a composition vector B = (b 1 , b 2 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , b N )",
