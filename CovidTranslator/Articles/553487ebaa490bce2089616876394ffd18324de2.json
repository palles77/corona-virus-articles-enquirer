Many early diagnostic technologies relied on cumbersome and insensitive methods such as serology, virus cultures, and antigen detection. Molecular diagnostic tests have since confirmed that coronaviruses are causative agents of respiratory distress, and have allowed identification to species. Today, reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), real-time PCR with melt curve analysis, and probe-based real-time RT-PCR are routinely used to detect human coronaviruses in nasopharyngeal swabs (Theamboonlers et al., 2007; Gaunt et al., 2010) . However, these techniques have limited sensitivity or are low throughput, precluding rapid screening of large numbers of samples.",

Swabs from infected monkeys were collected according to published methods (Yao et al., 2014) by Professor Qin Chuan at Institute of Laboratory Animal Sciences, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences. Viral RNA was detected in nasal, throat, and anal swabs within two days of infection, after which point viral RNA was most abundant in throat swabs (Supplementary Table S1 ). Notably, multiplex PCR was able to distinguish virus from Vero cell cultures at different titers (Supplementary Figure S2) . In addition, we tested the performance of two-tube real-time RT-PCR against whole blood and pharyngeal swabs collected in 2015 in Guangdong Province, China, from a Korean patient with suspected MERS (Lu et al., 2015) .

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and written informed consent Two-tube multiplex real-time RT-PCR for detection of six HCoVs was obtained from parents or guardians of all patients. As shown in Table 2 , two-tube multiplex real-time RT-PCR detected viruses in 24 (6.94%) samples, of which five (1.46%) were infected with NL63, and 10 (2.89%) were infected with 229E. Six samples (1.73%) tested positive for OC43, and HKU1 was detected in three (0.87%) samples. There were no differences between two-tube multiplex real-time RT-PCR and a previously established, one-tube multiplex RT-PCR assay with inline electrophoresis (QIAxcel, Qiagen) (Niu et al., 2014) . In addition, co-infection was detected by both assays in three patients (0.87%), of whom one was co-infected with NL63 and 229E, while the other two were co-infected with OC43 and 229E (Table 2) . Infection was confirmed (data not shown) by in-house monoplex real-time PCR (Lu et al., 2012) . Notably, one case of OC43 and two cases of HKU1 were detected by two-tube multiplex RT-PCR, but not by one-tube multiplex RT-PCR with inline electrophoresis. Nested RT-PCR and gene sequencing confirmed results from two-tube multiplex RT-PCR (data not shown), highlighting its potentially higher sensitivity for these viruses. Real-time RT-PCR is an established, rapid and effective method to detect multiple viral pathogens of the respiratory tract (Dare et al., 2007; Gaunt et al., 2010; Lu et al., 2012) . We have developed a sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR assay to detect all six human coronaviruses. Its ability to monitor HKU1 replication in cultures of human airway epithelial cells, to quantitatively measure viral RNA in monkeys experimentally infected with MERS, and to detect MERS in a human patient was demonstrated . In addition, the assay was used to assess disease burden and epidemiology of coronaviruses among hospitalized patients with acute respiratory infection, and able to detect co-infection. Finally, the assay re-quires significantly less sample than monoplex real-time RT-PCR. Thus, the assay will be widely used in coronavirus research.",
