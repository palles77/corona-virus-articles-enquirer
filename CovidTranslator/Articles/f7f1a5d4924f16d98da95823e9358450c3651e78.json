Recent years have seen dengue outbreaks all over Asia and Africa, with a WHO estimate of 50 million cases of dengue fever appear each year.

Today influenza is less of a public health threat, though it continues to be a serious disease that affects many people. Malaria almost eradicated 30 years ago, is on the rise again, affecting more than 500 million people annually, causing between 1 and 3 million deaths. Measles has seen a drastic reduction in countries where a vaccine is already available, but it is still prevalent in developing countries. Rotavirus the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis worldwide kills more than 600,000 children year each, mostly in developing countries. Tuberculosis causes nearly 2 million deaths every year, and WHO estimates that nearly 1 million people will be infected between 2000 and 2020 if more effective procedures are not adopted. Typhoid fever causes and estimated 600,000 deaths annually, out of 12-17 million cases [1] .

The major drawback is that most of these methods are laborious and time consuming as they involve the pathogen amplification step.

Methods that rely upon fluorescent molecular probes such as molecular beacons (a singlestranded DNA probe with hairpin-like structure; one end of the strand is attached to a fluorescent dye and the other end to a fluorescent quencher), suffer from severe photo-bleaching of the fluorescent dye that limits long-term analysis. Moreover, these probes are not highly sensitive for early detection. Similar limitations are observed using fluorescent protein based probes.

Surface attachment of biorecognition elements such as proteins, antibodies, DNA, etc. to NPs is usually carried out using conventional bioconjugate chemistries. Biomolecules can be attached to NPs through direct linkage by either physical adsorption or covalent coupling. In physical adsorption, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions between biomolecules and the NPs dominate over the interaction among NPs. Limitations of physical adsorption are: (i) less control on the number of attached biomolecules per NPs, (ii) orientation of biomolecules, and (iii) desorption of biomolecules. Covalent coupling is preferred to avoid these limitations. Covalent coupling of the biomolecules to NPs is usually done after modifying the surface of NPs with functional group(s) of interest, for example, sulfide, amine or carboxyl groups. In addition to providing site for biomolecule conjugation, the functional groups also play crucial role in controlling colloidal stability of the NPs.",

It has two characteristic surface proteins: F protein (fusion protein of the virus) and G protein (attachment protein of the virus); and it gets its name from the F protein which causes the cell membranes on nearby cells to merge, forming syncytia. A joint study carried out by Tripp and Nie groups demonstrated the suitability of using dual color Qdots for real-time detection of single virus particles and viral protein expression [6] . Their study was based on the principles of microcapillary flow cytometry and single molecule detection for high sensitivity that involved two types of fluorescent NPs: (i) 40-nm carboxyl-modified fluorescent NPs, (named, G NPs, 505/515; R NPs, 488/685) and (ii) streptavidin-coated Qdots 488/605. For the RSV detection, 40 nm NPs were coupled to either anti-RSV F protein or anti-RSV G protein monoclonal antibodies and allowed to interact with RSV. The photons produced by the laser excitation of the fluorophores were detected in the real time. This system operates on the concept that if two NPs are free to move in a solution, photons generated by them will arrive at the detector at different times unless they are bound to the same target. Hence, this can be used to detect target molecules at low concentrations with high sensitivity and discriminate between aggregate particles. Furthermore, a relative amount of surface F protein expression can be determined using this Qdot nanotechnology.",

For this study, two bioconjugated NPs (green and red emitting) were designed to recognize the same target molecule at two different sites. For RSV detection, the F protein antibody was conjugated to red emitting NPs and the G protein antibody was conjugated to green antibody. The sandwich-type binding brings two color-coded NPs together to form a NP pair with the RSV (wild type) for which both G and F proteins are expressed on the virus surface. Upon binding, the green-red pair moves in the solution as a single complex. When excited by a laser beam (488 nm excitation), the pair emits green and red fluorescence light simultaneously (i.e. time correlation). Real-time coincidence analysis of single photon events confirmed the presence of RSV in the sample. Tripp et al. demonstrated rapid and specific detection of RSV both in vitro and in vivo [8] using monoclonal antibody anti-F protein conjugated to 585 nm and 540 nm emitting cadmium telluride Qdots (RSV-NPs). These RSV-NPs were used also to quantitate RSV titers in a single-step fashion, thereby shortening the detection time needed to quantitate virus titers by plaque assay. These RSV-NPs were able to detect RSV plaques 2 days earlier than compared with conventional immunostaining, hence, indicating that the single-step RSV-NPs procedure is more sensitive in detecting limiting levels of RSV.",

The test was done for Salmonella typhimurium, E. coli and B. subtilis spores using CdSe/ZnS Qdots. Both antibody-Qdot and DNA aptamer-Qdot conjugates exhibited dramatic blue shift of at least 140 nm upon binding to the bacterial surface. The authors attributed this shift to the changes in the chemical environment and physical deformation of the Qdot conjugate upon binding to bacteria. The blue shift peak grows upon conjugation to antibodies/aptamers and subsequent binding to bacterial surfaces. With increase in concentration of the bacteria, the intensity of this peak increases while the intensity of the major emission peak of the Qdot either diminishes or disappears as shown in Fig. 1 .",

As a proof of concept three targets were taken (hepatitis B virus, HBV; hepatitis C virus, HCV; and human immunodeficiency virus, HIV) and three different Qdot-barcodes (QdotB) with different wavelengths (QdotB1-570 nm; QdotB2-615 nm, QdotB3-570 and 615 nm). These Qdot-Bs were then incubated in human serum sample spiked with antibodies for the corresponding viral antigens, forming sandwich assay complexes which provided the fluorescence signal peak. This assay protocol can also be integrated into microfluidic chip to minimize human involvement in the entire detection process and according to the authors the sensitivity can also be further enhanced. Because of the use of Qdots for preparing barcodes, this device can be further developed into a portable handheld point-of-care diagnostic system as a major advance in detecting, monitoring, treating and preventing infectious disease spread in developed and developing countries.",

Their study demonstrated that these engineered liposomes were able to mimic cells and recognize target toxins, thus forming a basis for toxin detection. These liposomes were labeled with fluorescent markers (rhodamine dyes) followed by a sandwich fluoroimmunoassay on antibody coated microtiter plates. Through this assay, they reported detection of toxins as low as 1 nM concentration.",

These virus particles were loaded with imaging contrast agents (fluorophore and MRI contrast agent) and targeted to a biofilm of S. aureus bacteria [35] .

The biotinylated CCMV was tagged with fluorescein, a fluorescent dye and the targeting was confirmed by flow cytometry analysis and epifluorescence microscopy. By means of fluorescence imaging, the depth of penetration of the CCMV particles into S. aureus biofilm was observed and the density of binding was found to be exceptionally high. The CCMV particles were assessed for its capacity to deliver MRI contrast agent Gadolinium-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (Gd-DOTA) to S. aureus cells. The concentration of Gd in the cell was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) which indicated a value of 1.8 \u00d7 10 5 Gd atoms per bacterial cell.

However, these assays may prove to be unaffordable in low resources settings as sophisticated instruments such as flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy are used for the detection of the diseases. These assays can be adopted if the detecting methods are made affordable and simpler. For developing countries, simple assays such as the liposome based strip test for the detection of cholera toxin, polystyrene NPs based test for malaria are ideal. Other applicable inexpensive techniques could be Qdot assisted detection of infectious diseases on an immunoassay platform which can be achieved on a lateral-flow based test device that would use light emitting diodes as excitation source.

The frequency of oscillation of these electrons is in resonance with the incident light. This resonance frequency or the surface plasmon band lies in the visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum giving rise to intense colors from solutions of colloidal metal particles [36] . This optical property known as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) can be measured by absorption and scattering spectroscopic techniques. Molecules adsorbed onto the metal surface can induce changes in the electron density on the surface causing a shift in the SPR absorption band, i.e., a change in the color. This is the basis for the application of gold and silver NPs as sensitive sensors in diagnostics [37, 38] . The SPR property is affected by the particle size, shape, material and the distance between particles (i.e., monodisperse and aggregated NPs have different properties) [37] . The SPR absorption has an absorption coefficient several orders of magnitude larger than strongly absorbing dyes [39] . The resonance light scattering property of the metal NPs has also been widely applied to detect biological species that form assemblies/aggregates with the NPs. These assemblies or aggregated species when excited by wavelength of light close to the region of their absorption bands, enhanced resonance light scattering signals are generated. Such signals can be measured spectroscopically or even by mere visualization.",

The thiolated lactose derivative plays the role of molecular recognition ligand and mimics the GM 1 ganglioside-the receptor to which cholera toxin binds in the small intestine. The lactose-NP solution has a surface plasmon band centered at 520 nm and appears red in color. When the cholera toxin binds to the lactose derivative, aggregation of the NPs is induced.

The lactosestabilized NPs were stable on freeze drying and could be resuspended in water to detect the cholera toxin in an electrolyte solution that mimicked the watery stool that is typical of cholera patients to test the selectivity for the toxin.

Using this signal amplification method, a protein chip assay was developed for simultaneous detection of HBV and HCV [48, 49] . In this protein chip assay, antigens of HBV and HCV were immobilized on a glass slide (called as chip) to capture HBV and HCV in human sera. Au NPs of 15 \u00b1 2 nm size labeled with staphylococcal protein A was mixed with the sample. The Au NPs were used as an indicator and silver staining was applied to amplify the detection signals, producing a black image on the chip. Thus, by seeing the color change, the pathogen gene could be diagnosed.",

But ELISA will not be able to detect the infection at an early stage as the antibodies against HCV antigens will not be produced then. Also, detectable antibodies could be absent in HCV infection that may be present in immunocompromised patients. The need for a direct RNA based test to detect the presence of HCV at an early stage of infection has motivated Ray and coworkers for screening and quantifying sequence-specific HCV RNA using nonlinear optical properties of Au NPs by Hyper-Rayleigh scattering (HRS) technique [51] . The assay is based on the fact that double and singlestranded oligonucleotides have different electrostatic properties. A fluorescent Raman dye rhodamine 6G tagged ssRNA was adsorbed onto the Au NPs. Fluorescence quenching of the dye and the enhancement of resonant Raman scattering from the dye were observed. Upon binding to the target RNA, duplex structure of the double stranded (ds) RNA is formed. Electrostatic repulsion between the ds RNA and the NP causes the ds RNA not to adsorb onto the Au NPs and the fluorescence of the dye persists. As soon as the ds RNA is separated from the Au NPs, a second effect is observed which is the aggregation of the Au NPs. This aggregation is evidenced by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and further confirmed by colorimetric studies. The aggregation causes increase in size resulting in increase in HRS intensity thereby confirming the detection of HCV virus RNA. Ray et al. used a similar HRS assay with Au nanorods for sensing sequence-specific HIV-1 virus DNA [52] .",

The assay was capable of detecting the H. pyroli and E. coli O157:H7 antigens at quantities as low as 10 ng.

In another study for detecting L. monocytogenes, Grossman et al. demonstrated the use of Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (SQUID) [68] . \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 of 50 nm size coupled to L. monocytogenes antibodies was added to an aqueous solution of the bacteria and the particles were allowed to bind to the target. A pulsed magnetic field was applied to align the magnetic dipole moments. Upon removal of the magnetic field, the magnetic relaxation signal of the NP-bacterial complex was measured. The basis of the detection is that unbound NPs relax too quickly to be detected while particles bound to the large bacteria were able to rotate and relax slowly. The detection limit in a 20 \u03bcl sample volume was (5.6\u00b1 1.1)\u00d7 10 6 of the cells. This assay had the advantage of doing away with the step of washing away of the unbound particles.",

However, when applying these innovations to developing countries or low resource settings, the user requirement needs understanding [82] . A diagnostic test requirement would be based on the infectious disease type as well as the different levels of health care facilities such as the community/rural health facility, the district/town hospital and the urban hospital. In developing countries, rural patients can often be misdiagnosed due to lack of access to diagnostic tests such as the diagnosis of malaria instead of HIV [83] . A lateral-flow based diagnostic testing or a test strip membrane would be very beneficial as by mere visualization of the test, the presence of an infection can be determined rapidly. This would prevent spreading of the infection, false diagnosis and resistance to the medication as in the case of bacterial infections. A quantitative test may not be of much use for a community or rural health worker while it may be more informative to a doctor at a hospital or clinic. But these quantitative tests often are expensive, require specialized equipments and highly trained technicians to carry out the analysis. Researchers have used specialized equipments such as flow cytometry, SQUID, spectroscopic techniques, TEM, confocal microscopy etc., to analyze trace amount of the pathogen. Some of these equipments may be acquired by a few urban hospitals but the cost factor and access to such facilities are not at reach to a large number of people in developing countries.",
