Few policy diffusion studies have examined use of information, such as cost-benef\u0131t analyses, in the diffusion process. The purpose of this study is to examine how cost-benef\u0131t analyses were used during the rapid diffusion of 2-1-1 across states. The paper also describes components of 2-1-1 cost-benef\u0131t analyses.",

Cost-benef\u0131t analyses (CBAs), often sponsored by advocates for 2-1-1, informed policymakers about likely economic impacts. It is well known in the 2-1-1 community that CBAs conducted for one jurisdiction were sometimes used by other jurisdictions as evidence of a positive economic benef\u0131t.",

A limited number of 2-1-1 services receive substantial state support, but most rely primarily on a combination of public and private support. 12 The 2-1-1s have not addressed funding and implementation challenges in isolation. Several national not-for-prof\u0131t organizations have promoted 2-1-1 nationally. Notably, United Way Worldwide and the Alliance of Information and Referral Systems (AIRS) have jointly championed 2-1-1 development. United Way Worldwide used its nationwide network of United Way member agencies to advocate at the national and local levels for adoption of and funding for 2-1-1s across the U.S. AIRS, the association of information and referral organizations, leveraged its network and incorporated 2-1-1 into its professional standards and certif\u0131cations. These two national organizations, along with local 2-1-1s, worked with legislators to propose federal funding through the Calling for 2-1-1 Act. The Act would have provided substantial federal funds to support 2-1-1s throughout the U.S. Although the act was not passed, several 2-1-1s successfully received targeted congressional appropriations. 13 United Way Worldwide and AIRS have served as networks for information sharing about the costs and benef\u0131ts of 2-1-1, typically by equipping local 2-1-1 supporters who were in contact with their state and local policymakers. AIRS and United Way Worldwide publicized documents and toolkits with information about the service's costs and benef\u0131ts through e-mail discussion groups, at national conferences, and through personal communications. In 2004, United Way Worldwide also commissioned a CBA for adoption of 2-1-1 across the entire U.S. AIRS' and United Way Worldwide's dissemination strategies appear to have promoted sharing of CBAs in states through local 2-1-1 supporters.",

            "text": "Many diffusion researchers have examined the interdependence of governmental bodies when making policy decisions, recognizing that policymakers do not enact policy in isolation. 24 Policymakers reduce the risk of making bad decisions by relying on a variety of sources, including those used by policymakers in other jurisdictions. 24, 25 Based in Rogers's 25 broader theory of diffusion of innovation, policy diffusion describes how policymakers opportunistically scan their environment for new ideas or solutions to problems. When an idea is identif\u0131ed, it is subjected to an information-gathering and testing period. During this period, policymakers may seek to reduce the risk of unexpected consequences by looking to the experiences of others. 26 Researchers hypothesize that jurisdictions emulate each other for four reasons: (1) policymakers face a problem and use solutions already developed by others as a decision-making shortcut; (2) policymakers want to remain competitive with other states to provide a good economy and quality of life for residents; (3) policymakers want to conform to the norms of other states or the expectations of the federal government; or (4) policymakers respond to public pressure from citizens and media. 27, 28 Researchers have studied diffusion in the context of a wide range of policies including lotteries, 26 gaming, 29 school choice, 30 end of life, 31 water fluoridation, 32 living wills, 33 antismoking, 34 and HMOs. 35 Policymakers may learn of innovations from policy networks, 30 professional associations, 35 epistemic communities, 36 nongovernmental organizations, 37 think tanks, 38 and the media. 28 This transfer of information may take place through face-to-face communications, but it also may occur through documentary and informal evidence. 39 Formally documented expert-based information, such as cost analyses, may be particularly desired and persuasive when policymakers are developing policy decisions. 40, 41 Despite the important and powerful role of such information, researchers have noted that few policy diffusion studies have focused on the use of information in the diffusion process. 9 The present study addresses this gap by examining the use of information produced through a popular policy tool (i.e., CBAs) in the rapid spread of 2-1-1 in the U.S.",
