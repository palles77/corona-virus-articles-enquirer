Since the memory CD8 + T lymphocyte responses in chickens to AIV proteins have not been defined, these responses to H5N9 AIV hemagglutinin (HA) and nucleocapsid (NP) proteins were evaluated by ex vivo stimulation with virus infected non-professional antigen presenting cells. Secretion of IFN\u03b3 by activated T lymphocytes was evaluated through macrophage induction of nitric oxide. AIV specific, MHC-I restricted memory CD8 + T lymphocyte responses to NP and HA were observed 3 to 9 weeks post-inoculation (p.i.). The responses specific to NP were greater than those to HA with maximum responses being observed at 5 weeks p.i. followed by a decline to weakly detectable levels by 9 weeks p.i. The cross-reaction of T lymphocytes to a heterologous H7N2 AIV strain demonstrated their ability to respond to a broader range of AIV.",

These viruses, natural infectious agents of waterfowl and shorebirds, are classified according to their transmembrane hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins (Alexander, 2000; Krauss et al., 2007; Olsen et al., 2006; Webby and Webster, 2001) . Due to their incredibly broad avian host range, AIV strains have been isolated from many different species of birds including ducks, gulls, geese, psittacines and poultry (Alexander, 2000; Olsen et al., 2006) . AIV strains with all 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) types have been isolated from waterfowl or shore birds (Fouchier et al., 2005; Krauss et al., 2007) . Depending on the virulence of the virus in poultry, isolates from poultry are classified as either low pathogenic (LP) or highly pathogenic (HP) (Alexander, 2000; Collisson et al., 2008) . LPAIV strains cause asymptomatic to mild respiratory and enteric tract infections while the highly pathogenic strains cause clinical illness and systemic infections. Infections of poultry, especially with the highly pathogenic strains, result in severe economic losses (Capua and Marangon, 2003; Tollis and Di Trani, 2002) . Human influenza viruses, including those causing high morbidity and significant mortality, such as the H1N1 from 1918, H2N2 from 1957 and H3N2 from 1968 have been shown to have avian origins (Capua and Alexander, 2002; Taubenberger et al., 2001) . Even the currently circulating swine origin H1N1 human influenza virus encodes two genes of AIV origin (Babakir-Mina et al., 2009; Garten et al., 2009) . Since 1996, highly pathogenic H5N1 AIV strains isolated in Hong Kong have been infecting and subsequently causing deaths in humans, although person-to-person transmission is apparently rare (Capua and Alexander, 2002; Perdue and Swayne, 2005; Ungchusak et al., 2005) . Poultry is a logical intermediate host for adaptation of viral strains from wild birds to humans and other mammals, such as swine (Webby and Webster, 2001; Webster, 1997) . Indeed, human adapted strains have been shown to consist of genome segments of avian, swine and human origin (Webby and Webster, 2001; Webster, 1997) .",

While sterile immunity may depend on humoral responses to homologous HA, effector and memory CD8 + T cell immunity in mice has been shown to diminish disease preventing mortality, and even morbidity Swain et al., 2004) . Humoral immunity of chickens to AIV is well characterized but little information is available regarding the more difficult to evaluate, viral specific T cell immune responses (Kwon et al., 2008; Seo and Webster, 2001; Swayne and Kapczynski, 2008) . Because mice are not natural hosts of AIV, all the immunological characterization in mice is based only on mouse adapted viruses. It is relevant to define the T lymphocyte mediated immune responses in chickens since AIVs are established pathogens of poultry and can be transmitted directly from chickens to humans.",

The availability of a number of poultry lines with defined MHC (located within the chicken B locus) greatly facilitates the evaluation of the adaptive T lymphocyte responses in chickens (Miller et al., 2004) . Studies targeting acute infections with a strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, have identified specific CD8 + T cell responses . Adoptive transfer of either effector T cells prepared from birds 10 days post-infection (p.i.) or of memory T lymphocytes prepared from birds 3 weeks after infection with IBV, provided protection against acute disease after viral challenge (Pei et al., 2003; Seo et al., 2000) . Following infection with H9N2 AIV, Seo et al. (2002) described CD8 + T cell responses that correlated with crossprotection to an H5N1 strain. Protection by effector CD8 + T lymphocytes prepared at 7 to 10 days p.i. with AIV was demonstrated following adoptive transfer 1 day prior to AIV challenge (Seo and Webster, 2001) . However, none of these studies with AIV identified the individual AIV proteins housing T lymphocytes epitopes or described the kinetics of the T lymphocyte mediated memory responses to AIV.",

Studies evaluating the CD8 + T lymphocyte response to influenza virus in mice have identified NP as housing the dominant CD8 + T cell epitopes (Flynn et al., 1998; Kreijtz et al., 2007; O'Neill et al., 2000; Townsend et al., 1984; Yewdell et al., 1985) . In contrast, human cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) have a broader repertoire and the response is directed to multiple influenza viral proteins, including HA (Gianfrani et al., 2000; Gotch et al., 1987; Jameson et al., 1998; Kedzierska et al., 2006; Kreijtz et al., 2008) . This study has shown that similar to the responses in humans, memory CD8 + T lymphocytes in chickens are directed against both AIV HA and NP proteins (Gianfrani et al., 2000; Jameson et al., 1998; Kreijtz et al., 2008; McMichael et al., 1986b) . Significantly greater responses were induced by NP than by HA at 3 and 5 weeks p.i. The AIV specific T cell responses were primarily MHC-I restricted as non-professional APCs of B19 and B2 haplotypes were used for ex vivo stimulation of T cells and the APCs of B2 haplotype chickens either failed to stimulate or could only weakly stimulate the T lymphocytes derived from the B19 line. Therefore, responding T cells were primarily of the CD8 + phenotype, which also showed significantly greater proliferation than CD4 + T lymphocytes in response to ex vivo APC mediated stimulation. Similar to the MHC-I restricted T lymphocyte responses demonstrated following infection with IBV, CD8 + T cell memory responses to AIV HA and/or NP were detected by 3 weeks p.i. (Pei et al., 2003) . Preliminary studies in our lab have also demonstrated an elevation in the levels of expression of CD44 molecule on the surface of the responding T lymphocytes. Greater CD44 expression has been described to be a characteristic of mouse and human memory T lymphocytes (Curtsinger et al., 1998) .",

The more conserved nature of NP, in comparison to HA could be responsible for the greater cross reactive response (Portela and Digard, 2002) .

Viable cells were collected from the interface and washed twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). Cells were resuspended in 3 ml of RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products, West Sacramento, CA), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acids. B lymphocytes were removed by passing the cell suspension through complete RPMI equilibrated nylon wool column and adherent cells were removed by incubating the cell preparation in 25 cm 2 tissue culture flasks as described previously . Flow cytometric analysis of cells labeled with anti-chicken CD3 FITC MAbs (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL) as described previously determined that the lymphocyte population recovered after nylon wool separation and removal of adherent cells was 97% positive for the expression of the T lymphocyte marker, CD3 (Bohls et al., 2006) .",

To ensure that the data represent the nitric oxide produced specifically by the IFN\u03b3 mediated stimulation of HD11 cells and not due to any other soluble inducing factors, nitrite concentration in each sample was normalized by subtracting the nitrite concentration of supernatants from control APCs cultured without T lymphocytes. The concentration of nitrite produced was determined using sodium nitrite solutions with a concentration of 1 to 20 \u03bcmol as standards.",

Chickens of the B19/B19 MHC haplotype were inoculated with DNA plasmids expressing AIV HA, NP or both HA and NP (HN). Memory T lymphocytes were stimulated ex vivo with H5N9 AIV infected MHC matched B19/B19 and mismatched B2/B2 APCs. Production of NO by HD11 macrophage cells induced by the secretion of IFN\u03b3 from stimulated T lymphocytes was used to quantify lymphocyte activation. Results represent the average (\u00b1 S.E.) of two separate experiments. Each ex vivo stimulation assay is denoted by the source of T lymphocytes and MHC haplotype of the APCs infected with the virus. The differences in stimulation by matched and mismatched APCs were significant (p \u2264 0.003 to 0.02) for each inoculated antigen and time point. The responses to HN (p \u2264 0.03) at 3 weeks and NP (p \u2264 0.03) and HN (p \u2264 0.007) at 5 weeks p.i. were significantly greater than the responses to HA at the same time points. The p value for the difference between responses to NP and HA at 3 weeks p.i. was 0.07.",
