The in vitro transcripts from two HLSV full-length cDNA clones, which contain a heptaadenosine stretch (pHLSV-7A) and an octo-adenosine stretch (pHLSV-8A), are both infectious. The replication level of HLSV-7A in Nicotiana benthamiana protoplasts was 5-fold lower, as compared to that of HLSV-8A. The replicase proteins of HLSV-7A were produced through programmed \u00c0 1 ribosomal frameshift ( \u00c0 1 PRF) and the 7A stretch was a slippery sequence for \u00c0 1 PRF. Mutations to the downstream pseudoknot of 7A stretch showed that the pseudoknot was not required for the frameshift in vitro. The stretch was found to be extended to 8A after subsequent replication cycles in vivo. It is envisaged that HLSV employs the monotonous runs of A and \u00c0 1 PRF to convert its 7A to 8A to reach higher replication for its survival in plants.",

            "text": "The genomic RNAs of viruses are often polycistronic and need to use strategies to express their downstream open reading frames (ORFs). Production of subgenomic RNAs, readthrough of the stop codon, ribosome leaky scanning and programmed \u00c0 1, \u00c0 2 or \u00fe 1 ribosomal frameshift (PRF) are strategies used by viruses (Plant, 2012) . PRF has been reported in some plant virus groups, including Luteovirus, Dianthovirus, Umbravirus, Polerovirus and Enamovirus, and most proteins translated via ribosomal frameshifting are the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Miller and Giedroc, 2010) . Typically, \u00c0 1 PRF requires two cis-acting RNA elements. The first element is a hepta-nucleotide sequence where the reading frame shifts. This sequence usually fits the consensus XXXYYYN (X is any identical base, Y is A or U, and N is not G; Dreher and Miller, 2006; Jacks et al., 1988) . A second element is an RNA secondary structure, a pseudoknot or a very stable RNA structure (Giedroc and Cornish, 2009) , immediately downstream from the shift site (Brierley et al., 1989; Brierley and Pennell, 2001) . This RNA structure is regarded as a physical barrier to stop translating ribosomes and to shift the reading frame (Namy et al., 2006) . There are examples in which slippery sequence could trigger frameshift, independent of the adjacent downstream RNA secondary structure (Wang et al., 2006; Wilson et al., 1988) . In addition, far downstream RNA elements of the slippery sequences in Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) and Red clover necrotic mosaic virus (RCNMV) required for \u00c0 1 PRF through base pairing with the immediate downstream RNA sequence were also reported (Barry and Miller, 2002; Paul et al., 2001; Tajima et al., 2011) .",

The deduced \u00c0 1 PRF product 108 kDa protein was expected when pHLSV-7A was digested with BspHI (at nt 2940 of HLSV genome) (Fig. 2C , fourth lane from the right), as compared to the full-length 128 kDa protein produced in pHLSV-7A when digested with XhoI ( Fig. 2C , second lane from the right). If the 7A stretch is a slippery sequence, only a 78 kDa or a 108 kDa target protein will be produced from in vitro transcripts of HLSV-AAGAAGA or HLSV-AAGAAGAA. In vitro translation experiment showed that 78 kDa (Fig. 2C , second lane from the left) and 108 kDa proteins (Fig. 2C , third lane from the left) were detected from HLSV-AAGAAGAA and HLSV-AAGAAGA, respectively (Fig. 2C) .

The immediate downstream 80 nt RNA sequence of the hepta-adenosine stretch of HLSV was analyzed with the online software KnotInFrame (http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/kno tinframe) and a predicted 60 nt pseudoknot composed of 3 stems was obtained (Fig. 3A , the first panel from left). To investigate the function of the pseudoknot on \u00c0 1 PRF, the 3 stems were mutated partially or completely in pHLSV-7A (Fig. 3A ) and the pseudoknot structure was not detected using the software, when all three stems were mutated (data not shown). Similar level of \u00c0 1 PRF product, 128 kDa protein, was detected in each mutant, as compared to that in HLSV-7A, which indicates that the pseudoknot is not required for the \u00c01 PRF in HLSV-7A (Fig. 3B , left panel).

In this study, a downstream 60 nt RNA pseudoknot sequence of the 7A stretch in HLSV was predicted by using the online software KnotInFrame (Theis et al., 2008) . Mutation analyses of the three stems within the pseudoknot showed that they were not required for \u00c0 1 PRF (Fig. 3B ) in vitro. Translation analysis of BspHI digested pHLSV-7A showed that the far downstream RNA sequences are also not required for the \u00c01 PRF (Fig. 2C , fourth lane from the right). These results indicate that the 7A stretch can function solely for the \u00c0 1 PRF in vitro. Similarly, a 7U stretch has been reported to be a sole signal for efficient \u00c01 PRF in coronavirus (Wang et al., 2006) . Earlier study on HIV also showed that frameshift was independent of the downstream pseudoknot structure (Wilson et al., 1988) . The slippery sequences in the two cases mentioned above are all monotonous runs of U. Taken together, we believe that, compared to other slippery sequences, the monotonous runs of A or U are the sole signals for \u00c01 PRF.",

However, in the translation products from purified viral RNA from infected N. benthamiana leaves, there was no detectable 78 kDa protein band (Fig. 2B , first lane from the right).

In HLSV, the 7A stretch was extended to 8A during its replication. We believe that HLSV replicases can slide backward or forward on the slippery sequence of the positive or negative strand RNA such that one additional A or U is added on the respective strands. Once an A is added, the virus will replicate faster through more replicase production. Therefore, HLSV with 8A becomes dominant in HLSV-7A inoculated leaves at 6 dpi. For tobamoviruses such as Tobacco mosaic virus and Odontoglossum ringspot virus, their replicase proteins produced by a replication-competent mutant are able to complement replication-defective mutants in trans but the efficiency is low (Ogawa et al., 1991; Wang et al., 2004) . Thus, the dominance of HLSV with 8A is due to its faster replication through production of higher amount of replicase proteins. Fig. 3 .

            "text": "To detect the distribution of 7A and 8A stretch in wild-type HLSV infected plants, in vitro transcripts derived from XhoI digested pHLSV-8A were inoculated onto N. benthamiana leaves. The upper leaves were collected at 21 dpi for virions purification, followed by viral RNA extraction, RT-PCR, cDNA cloning and sequencing. In randomly selected 61 clones, 60 clones contained 8A stretch and one clone contained 11A stretch, but no 7A stretch was detected (data not shown). This may be due to limited number of colonies sequenced. According to this result, the possibility of the 7A stretch in pHLSV-7A resulting from PCR error is very low. While we cannot rule out the possibility of slippery sequence occurring during in vitro transcription, it will be logistically difficult to check the rare occurrence. Since we have observed an 11A sequence in the 8A inoculated plants, it is evident that the slippery event does occur in vivo. The error rate (mismatch) for T7 RNA polymerase during transcription is 6 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 6 and no insertion or deletion event was detected (Brakmann and Grzeszik, 2001; Rong et al., 1998) . The existence of 11A stretch in HLSV infected plant reveals that virus replicase may have been slided backward 3A in the 8A stretch during replication.",

These results indicate that \u00c01 PRF tends to be evolutionarily conserved, and also some genes tend to select monotonous runs of nucleotides to ensure the right protein production once deletion or insertion happens (Sharma et al., 2011) . We believe that HLSV also uses the A stretch to ensure its replicase proteins production once deletion happens. In conclusion, the HLSV-7A uses monotonous runs of 7A, \u00c0 1 PRF and 1A insertion to reach its optimal replication through the functional replicase production in plants.",

The synthesized cDNA was used to amplify the HLSV 5\u2032-end (nt 1-3333) and 3\u2032-end (nt 3334-6474) fragments using primer pairs HL-F1/HL-R2 and HL-F2/HL-R1, respectively. The 3\u2032-end fragment was first digested with XbaI and MluI and inserted into modified pBlueScript II KS(\u00fe ), resulting in p3\u2032HLSV. The 5\u2032-end fragment was inserted into pGEM s -T vector (Promega) to generate p5\u2032HLSV which was cut with KpnI and XbaI and inserted into the p3\u2032HLSV, resulting in HLSV fulllength clones pHLSV containing 87 nt internal poly(A) tract. To construct the slippery sequence mutants, a subclone pHLSV2960 was constructed by inserting the PCR product amplified by primers HL-F22 and HL-R18 using pHLSV as template into pGEM s -T Easy Vector (Promega). The following two plasmids were constructed using pHLSV2960 as a template by Quick Change mutagenesis (Stratagene) and verified by sequencing. Primers HL-F25 and HL-R20 were used for 7A stretch mutants, designated as pHLSV-AAGAAGA. Primers HL-F19 and HL-R16 were used for 8A stretch mutant, designated as pHLSV-AAGAAGAA. To construct the downstream pseudoknot mutants, in which partial or all three stems within the pseudoknot were disrupted by nucleotide substitution, primer pairs were designed to amplify pHLSV-7A. The designated plasmid names and their corresponding primers were as follows: HL-F39 and HL-R33, HL-F40 and HL-R34, HL-F41 and HL-R35, HL-F44 and HL-R38, HL-F45 and HL-R39 and HL-F43 and HL-R37 were for pHLSV-7AmS1\u00fe S2\u00feS3, pHLSV-7A-mS1\u00fe mS2\u00fe S3, pHLSV-7A-mS1\u00femS2\u00femS3, pHLSV-7A-mS1\u00fe S2\u00femS3, pHLSV-7A-S1\u00fe mS2\u00femS3 and pHLSV-7A-S1\u00feS2\u00fe mS3, respectively. To introduce a stop codon in the third stem in pHLSV-7A, primers HL-F46 and HL-R40 were used to amplify pHLSV-7A and this mutant was designated as pHLSV-7A-mS1\u00fe mS2\u00fe mS3stop.",
