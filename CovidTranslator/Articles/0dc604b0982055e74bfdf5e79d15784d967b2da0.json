            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was originally identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. It has caused MERS outbreaks with high mortality in the Middle East and Europe, raising a serious concern about its pandemic potential. Therefore, development of effective vaccines is crucial for preventing its further spread and future pandemic. Our previous study has shown that subcutaneous (s.c.) vaccination of a recombinant protein containing receptor-binding domain (RBD) of MERS-CoV S fused with Fc of human IgG (RBD-Fc) induced strong systemic neutralizing antibody responses in vaccinated mice. Here, we compared local and systemic immune responses induced by RBD-Fc via intranasal (i.n.) and s.c. immunization pathways. We found that i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc induced systemic humoral immune responses comparable to those induced by s.c. vaccination, including neutralizing antibodies, but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and significantly higher local mucosal immune responses in mouse lungs. This study suggests the potential of developing MERS-CoV RBD protein into an effective and safe mucosal candidate vaccine for prevention of respiratory tract infections caused by MERS-CoV.",

Different from SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV has a broader tissue tropism capable of infecting a variety of human and non-human cell types, including primate, porcine, and bat cells, and it maintains broad replicative capability in mammalian cell lines [7, 8] . Nevertheless, considering the similarity between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, which both belong to the genus betacoronavirus [1] , the approaches for the development of effective SARS vaccines are expected to be applicable to MERS vaccine development. Previous studies on SARS have revealed that systemic humoral and cellular immune responses play important roles in the prevention of viral infection based on the production of high neutralizing antibodies and T cell immune responses [9] [10] [11] . In addition, mucosal immune response represented by secretory IgA is also crucial in the clearance of infected virus [12, 13] . The studies from SARS suggested that systemic humoral, cellular, and local mucosal immune responses will also be important in the prevention of MERS infection.",

Our previous studies have shown that a recombinant SARS-CoV RBD protein fused with human Fc induced highly potent immune responses that completely protected vaccinated mice against SARS-CoV challenge [20, 21] . We have also demonstrated that recombinant Fc fusion proteins containing conserved sequences of hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) of H5N1 influenza virus elicited stronger neutralizing antibody responses than those without fusion with Fc that cross-protected mice from divergent strains of H5N1 virus challenge [22] , confirming the ability of Fc in the enhancement of immunogenicity of the fusion proteins. The potential mechanism may be associated with its ability to promote correct folding of the fusion proteins, and allow the proteins binding to Fc receptor (FcR)-containing antigenpresenting cells (APCs) [23, 24] . Notably, the immunogenicity of human Fc region in mice has no detrimental effect on the immunogenicity of the specific antigen in the fusion proteins, as evidenced by the fact that H5N1 HA1 or MERS-CoV RBD proteins fused with human IgG Fc could elicit high titers of H5N1 influenza virus HA1 or MERS-CoV S1-specific antibody responses, respectively, in vaccinated mice [22, 25] .",

As shown in Fig. 2A , a single prime dose i.n. vaccination of RBD-Fc did not elicit significant IgG antibody response, while MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG antibodies rapidly increased to a higher level post-last vaccination. In comparison, a single prime dose s.c. vaccination of RBD-Fc induced a relatively higher level of specific IgG antibody response. Although s.c. boost vaccination of the protein elicited increasing levels of IgG antibodies after the last vaccination, the antibody titer (1:3000) was similar to that induced via i.n. vaccination. Sera from s.c. and i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc could bind specifically to MERS-CoV S1 protein without fusion with Fc (Fig. 2B) , with the endpoint IgG antibody titers reaching similar levels at 1:8.3 \u00d7 10 4 for s.c., or 1:4.0 \u00d7 10 4 for i.n., respectively (Fig. 2C) , post-last vaccination.

More specifically, both vaccination pathways induced a relatively higher level of Th1associated IgG2a than Th2-associated IgG1. It should be noted that similar levels of IgG3, which is considered important in antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity and virus neutralization [37] , were detectable in vaccinated mouse sera via both i.n. and s.c. routes. These data suggested that MERS-CoV RBD-Fc immunization by the i.n. route was capable of eliciting similar, if not greater, systemic humoral antibody responses than those elicited by the s.c. pathway in vaccinated mice. Significantly, a similarly high titers of serum neutralizing antibodies were raised in mice vaccinated with 5 doses of RBD-Fc protein via both i.n. and s.c. routes (P > 0.05, Fig. 6 ), about 4-fold higher than that attained from 2 doses of s.c. vaccination of the same protein [18] . That the increase of vaccination doses leads to improved neutralizing antibody titers indicates the need for multiple vaccinations of RBD protein containing residues 377-662 of MERS-CoV S to induce stronger neutralizing antibody responses that can be maintained up to 6 months.",

Accordingly, vaccines capable of inducing strong local mucosal immunity represented by secretory IgA would be helpful in preventing MERS-CoV infection. Our data indicated that MERS-CoV S1-specific IgA antibody responses with neutralizing activity in vaccinated mouse lungs were elicited by i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein, which were significantly higher than those induced by s.c. vaccination of the same protein, confirming the ability of RBD-Fc to induce strong local mucosal immunity via the i.n. route. Our previous studies on SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines demonstrated that induction of mucosal IgA via the i.n. pathway played an important role in preventing SARS-CoV infection. We have previously demonstrated that in the presence of high titer of mucosal IgA, mice with serum neutralizing antibody as low as 1:190 can still be fully protected from SARS-CoV challenge replication [12] . It is thus reasonable to prospect that high titers of local mucosal neutralizing IgA, and serum neutralizing antibodies induced by i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc protein, as shown in this study, will effectively inhibit MERS-CoV infection and protect the animals from MERS-CoV challenge.",

Similarly, when compared to the s.c. route adjuvanted with Montanide ISA 51, we found that MERS-CoV RBD-Fc was able to induce a higher frequency of MERS-CoV S1-specific, IL-2producing CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in vaccinated mouse spleens through the i.n. route in the presence of Poly(I:C) adjuvant. The higher cellular immune responses induced by RBD-Fc vaccination through the i.n. route, compared to the s.c. route, are possibly because of different adjuvants used in the corresponding pathway. It was reported that that s.c.-vaccination of a cancer vaccine formulated with Montanide ISA 51 and Picibanil OK-432 adjuvants is able to induce antigen-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses in majority of the vaccinated patients [43] , while i.n. administration of Yersinia pestis LcrV protein fused to anti-DEC antibody adjuvanted with Poly(I:C) induced high frequencies of IFN-\u2425 secreting CD4 + T cells as well as IFN-\u2425/TNF-\u2423/IL-2-secreting polyfunctional CD4 + T cells in the airway and lung of vaccinated mice [44] . Thus, further optimization of the MERS-CoV candidate vaccines in the presence of different adjuvants is essential to evaluate the roles of cellular immune response, in addition to humoral and mucosal immunity, in protecting against MERS-CoV infection once an animal challenge model for MERS becomes available.",

We found that i.n. vaccination of MERS-CoV RBD-Fc induced systemic humoral immune responses, including neutralizing antibodies, comparable to those induced by s.c. vaccination, but more robust systemic cellular immune responses and significantly higher local (lung) mucosal immune responses in the vaccinated mice. Therefore, our results suggest the possibility of developing this protein into an effective and safe mucosal MERS vaccine for preventing MERS-CoV infection and stopping further spread of MERS-CoV.",
