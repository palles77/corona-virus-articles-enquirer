For both measures, Wuhan participants were more responsive to the outbreak (p<0.001). Controlling for personal characteristics, logistic regression results suggested that risks of moderate or severe anxiety were positively associated with perceived susceptibility (odds ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.3-1.8) and severity of the disease (1.6, 1.4-1.9) and confusion about information reliability (1.6, 1.5-1.9).

Since Jan 23, 2020, the Chinese government has put Wuhan and several nearby cities under quarantine, hoping to stop the disease from spreading to other parts of the country. However, millions of people had left Wuhan before the lockdown because of the approaching Spring Festival holiday.",

Therefore, the psychological and behavioral responses of the general population play an important role in the control of the outbreak. Previous studies have explored on this topic in various culture settings with SARS, 4, 5, 6 pandemic influenza A(H1N1), 7, 8, 9, 10 and influenza A(H7N9). 11, 12, 13 Cultural differences are evident in public responses. 14, 15 Behavioral changes are also associated with government involvement level, perceptions of diseases, and the stage of the outbreak, and these factors vary by diseases and settings. 4, 5, 8, 16 The current COVID-19 outbreak provides a unique platform to study behavioral changes for two main reasons. First, government engagement in the control of the outbreak has been unprecedented, for example, locking down Wuhan and surrounding cities, building new hospitals to treat infected patients in Wuhan within two weeks, extending holidays and school closure, deploying thousands of medical staff to heavily affected areas, and running intense public messaging campaigns. Second, the public are faced with rather mixed information, partly because knowledge of the newly emerging disease is evolving with the course of the outbreak. For example, the national technical protocols for COVID-19 released by the National Health Commission have been updated five times within a month. Both features might result in different public responses towards the outbreak. In this study, we aimed to investigate psychological and behavioral responses to the threat of COVID-19 outbreak and to examine public perceptions associated with the response outcomes in mainland China.",

We found that the proportion of handwashing duration over 40 seconds as recommended by WHO only slightly increased from 17.3% to 37.6% during novel coronavirus outbreak. 30 Fortunately, having received and read information brochures was positively associated with longer handwashing duration (Table S3) , suggesting education programs will be effective for addressing this issue.

First, in order to investigate public response rates in the immediate aftermath of the major public health crisis, we shortened our survey questionnaire and chose to use random digital dialing with quota sampling to obtain demographically representative samples for both selected cities. We deliberately selected out times of handwashing as a key behavior measure, although it is widely discussed in the literature. Because people have largely reduced going out during the extended national holidays while embracing remote work, resulting in less times of handwashing than in usual days, which makes this measure less valid. Second, we asked respondents to recall some of their behaviors in usual days before December 2019. Their answers might suffer recall bias.",

Prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety were 4-5 times of its normal level in urban China. The majority engaged in all six recommended and avoidance behaviors. Wuhan, the epicentre and quarantined city, was significantly more responsive in the aforementioned domains than Shanghai. Tremendous government efforts in control and prevention of the disease were associated with sizable changes in face mask wearing. However, confusion about information reliability significantly fueled the public anxiety levels, and public awareness of hand hygiene was less optimal. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information and to focus more on handwashing education. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",

First, the findings suggest that anxiety levels and precautionary behaviors have changed rapidly and dramatically in both studied cities during the early stage of the outbreak, regardless of their quarantine status. The prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety has been 4-5 times of its normal level in urban China; 24,25 the percentage of always wearing a face mask surged from 9.2-12.2% in usual days to 76.1-85.5 during the past week (Figure 2); preventing illness and virus has been the most evident reason for such a drastic change (Figure S2); and the main reason for those not always wearing a facemask after the outbreak was the face-mask shortage. These results contradict to findings in UK during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, 7 but are consistent with and much sizeable than those in Hong Kong during SARS and influenza A(H1N1).4,8,10",
