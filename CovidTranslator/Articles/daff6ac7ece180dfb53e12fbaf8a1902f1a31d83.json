Most descriptions of neonatal infection use the terms \"early-onset\" and \"late-onset\" infection. Early-onset infections are confirmed infections occurring during the first 3 days of life, and late-onset infections are those occurring from day 4 onward. Nosocomial infection is equivalent to late-onset, or infection after the first 72 hours of life. 1 The prevalence of nosocomial infections in NICUs has increased over the past decade, with reported rates per admission varying from 6.2% to 30%. 1 Incidences of 3 in 1,000 live births and 29 in 1,000 neonatal admissions were recently reported. 2 A retrospective study in a NICU in The Netherlands over a 29-year period found that the incidence of late onset sepsis increased from 7.1% in the years 1988-1992 to 17.4% in 1998-2002 and 13.9% in 2003-2006. 3 The vast majority of published scientific articles dealing with nosocomial infections have focused on bacterial or fungal infections, with viral agents often disregarded. Indeed, viral infections among hospitalized infants in NICUs is still a largely unexplored field in neonatology, owing to the diagnostic complexity of viral infection and to the fact that sensitive and specific diagnostic tests have become available only in the last few years. Vergnano et al, 2 in a prospective multicenter study based on data from a UK neonatal infection surveillance network, reported that gram-positive bacteria accounted for 49% of all late-onset nosocomial infections, gram-negative bacteria for 42%, and fungi for 9%; viral agents were not investigated. Indeed, the role of nosocomial virus infections is generally neglected in epidemiologic scenarios.",

Patient screening or surveillance, isolation or cohorting of patients, enforcement of hand hygiene measures, use of protective clothing, and personnel screening or surveillance were the most frequently introduced measures. In 26.56% of cases, the countermeasures were ineffective in stopping the outbreak, and the involved wards had to be closed.
