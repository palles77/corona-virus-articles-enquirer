The haemagglutination titre of virus produced in intestinal organ cultures was often four-fold higher than the highest titre obtained in either tracheal organ cultures or in cell cultures infected with the adapted strain of bovine coronavirus (Bridget, Woode & Meyling, to be published). These results suggest that in the intestinal organ cultures virus replication is more efficient. It will be interesting to know whether this system is more sensitive for primary isolation.",
