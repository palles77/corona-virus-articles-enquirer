Two groups of five dogs were experimentally inoculated with 50 and 100 third stage infective larvae (L 3 ) of A. vasorum per kilogram of body weight. A third group of five uninfected animals was used as control. One sample of 10 ml of blood was collected from each animal on the 10, 20, 30, and 45 days after inoculation (dai) and at 30-day intervals thereafter for the remainder of the 210-day experimental period. The blood sample was used for the complete hemogram and platelet count, as well as measurements of prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and factors V and VIII. Anemia was observed in infected dogs, 6 weeks after the infection. The eosinophils presented peaks in four periods after infection. Thrombocytopenia became accentuated on the 72 dai. Decreased prothrombin time activity and increased partial thromboplastin time were observed at the 6 and 9 weeks after infection and decreased of factors VIII and V activities occurred from 4 to 6 weeks after infection. It may be conclude that infection by A. vasorum in dogs may cause a discrete anemia during the acute phase which is probably regenerative. In addition, important hemostatic alterations due to the infection suggest a chronic intravascular consumption coagulopathy.",

A determinant factor in the pathology of the angiostrongilosis seems to be related to the location of the parasite in the host. Their presence inside the arteries and ramifications, promoting a mechanical and/or metabolic action on the wall of the vessels, may alter the hemostatic pathway, being able to induce to a coagulopathy of intravascular consumption, and changes in the hematological profile. Experimental studies suggest that infection with parasites, causes thrombocitopenia and changes of the coagulation profile developed subsequent to 6 weeks and paralleled the apparent host inflammatory response to the parasite (Schelling et al., 1986) .",

All of the dogs were immunized against parvovirus, coronavirus and distemper virus, in three doses at 1 month interval. The dogs were divided according to their weight in three groups of five animals. Groups A and B were inoculated, by oral route, with 50 and 100 infective larvae/kg of body weight, respectively. Group C was not inoculated and provided a control for the experiment.

The hypochromic red blood cells present in the infected animals suggest that the parasite interferes in the synthesis of hemoglobin and in the iron release by the cells of the reticulum endothelial system (RES). The insufficient iron release may compromise the synthesis of hemoglobin in the erythroblasts resulting in hypochromia and reduction of the cellular volume. This fact could explain the reduction of the hemoglobin and hematocrit values with no decrease in the counting of red blood cells.",

With regard to the differential leukocyte count, the kinetic of the immature and segmented neutrophils presented inverse profile on the 45 dai, suggesting migration of the segmented neutrophils to the tissues and a rapid release of immature neutrophils to the peripheral blood. Neutrophils that have migrated into tissue do not return to the bloodstream, normally, they migrate into the lung, gastrointestinal tract, liver and spleen (Osgood, 1954) . Since A. vasorum is known to have a pulmonary phase and this may cause an inflammatory process in the lungs. Neutrophils are attracted to the tissues in response to stimuli from inflamed area and may secrete cytokynes that further influence the number of these cells in the bloodstream, as well as the release of immature neutrophils. Traumatic injury produced by adult worms, causing tissue necrosis, larvae elimination and migration, would justify the mobilization of immature neutrophils from bone marrow to the bloodstream and subsequently to the tissues. It is possible that constituents of tissue necrosis may result in enhanced cytokynes production by lymphocytes that promote myelopoiesis (Nimer and Goldi, 1995) .",

They migrate from bone marrow to peripheral blood, both in marginal pools and the circulation, as well as to the tissues. Eosinophils levels depend on the activity of different eosinophilopoietic factors and the contributions of margination and recirculation. The most common causes of blood and tissue eosinophilia are hypersensibility reactions and parasite infection. It is known that acute pulmonary eosinophilic infiltrates with blood eosinophilia may be caused by immune reactions to antigens localized in the lungs including drugs and parasites, frequently (Galli and Goetzl, 1995) . Based on the host/parasite interaction, it is possible that the peaks in four periods, observed for eosinophils in the present work (on 10, 20, 72 and 160 dai) to be associated to the maturation of the L 3 larvae to the early L 5 stage within mesenteric lymph nodes and subsequent migration of the latter via the hepatic portal system to the right side of the heart and pulmonary arteries during the initial periods of infection. During the growing of adults worms and patency, immunogenic particles released from the parasites may produce eosinophilia by multiple interactions involving macrophages and lymphocytes. These results are similar to those of Mishra and Cens (1971) , who observed peaks, associated the with infective larvae migration, growing of the adults worms and patency. Eosinophils alterations were reported by Rosen et al. (1970) , Bwangamoi (1972) , Perry et al. (1991) , however, Prestwood et al. (1981) and Cury (1995) did not find any consistent hematological abnormalities in dogs infected experimentally with A. vasorum.",

Due to the possible presence of vascular lesion, which would be caused by parasites and/or antigen-antibody complexes deposition, a greater afflux of platelets to the area could happen resulting in the reduction of the number of circulating platelets.
