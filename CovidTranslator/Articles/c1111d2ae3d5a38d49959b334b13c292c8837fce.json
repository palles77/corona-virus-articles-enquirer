The burden of disease outside hospital is practically unknown, owing to the absence of surveillance.

            "text": "In the USA, one in 136 patients becomes severely ill as a result of acquiring an infection in hospital. 6 This rate is equivalent to 2 million cases, leading to additional cost estimates of US$4\u00b75-5\u00b77 billion and about 80 000 deaths a year. In England, health-care-associated infections are estimated to cost \u00a31 billion and directly cause more than 5000 deaths annually. 7 In Mexico, the estimate is 450 000 infections, causing 35 deaths per 100 000 inhabitants each year. 8 In developing countries, more than half of all infants in neonatal units acquire a health-care-associated infection, with a fatality rate of 4-56%. 9 In turn, while caring for the sick, health-care workers are also exposed to risks, including tuberculosis, hepatitis, and HIV. During the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the proportion of infected healthcare workers ranged from about 20% to 60% of cases worldwide with differences between hospitals; the better the education in infection control, the lower the risk. 10, 11 Health-care-associated infection shows many of the characteristics of a major problem for patients' safety. It affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, complicates the delivery of patients' care, contributes to patients' deaths and disability, promotes resistance to antibiotics, and generates additional expenditure to that already incurred by the patient's underlying disease. Infection has several causes related to the systems and the processes of care provision, economic constraints on systems and countries, and human behaviour. Prevention strategies reduce infection in both developed and developing countries; most are simple and not resource-demanding. 12 others have not. Thus, gaps in patients' safety arise because existing tools and interventions are not being implemented widely. Importantly, this gap exists not only between countries, but also within the same country; where some hospitals succeed, others cannot, or even do not, try. The Global Patient Safety Challenge embraces wellestablished WHO strategies already addressing risks for infection in areas such as blood, injection, and immunisation, safety of clinical procedures, safe water, basic sanitation, and waste management. These actions have a direct bearing on health-care-associated infection and patients' safety and are combined with efforts to implement new WHO guidelines on hand hygiene in health care in response to the message \"Clean Care is Safer Care\". 5 The challenges are enormous, but so are the rewards: preventing illness, saving lives, improving patients' safety, and providing an overall better quality of care for millions of patients and families.",
