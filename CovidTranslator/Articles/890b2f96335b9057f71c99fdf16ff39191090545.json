            "text": "We have previously found that Lewis rat myelin basic protein (MBP)-reactive lymphocytes (Lc) were cytotoxic in vitro to cultured syngeneic oligodendrocytes (oligos). We report here additional studies to characterize this reaction. The effector lymphocytes in the cytotoxic reaction are also encephalitogenic as evidenced by the capacity of other aliquots of these cells to transfer experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). We confirmed that the presence of both MBP and antigen-presenting cells (APC) are required for this in vitro cytotoxic effect. This reaction (measured by 51Cr release from labeled oligos) is dose-dependent on the effector/target ratio with marked 51Cr release at a 20/1 ratio. Effector/target cell contact is required since: (a) 51Cr release is not significantly increased when effector Lc and oligo are separated by a micropore membrane (28% vs. 24% spontaneous release); (b) no cytotoxic activity is present in the supernatant fluid of a toxic reaction. The adhesion of 51Cr-labeled effector Lc to unlabeled oligo is increased in the presence of both MBP and APC (21 _ 1.0% of cell adhering) as compared with effector Lc + APC (12 + 2.7%), or effector Lc alone (14 + 2.8%). Surface expression of class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens was expressed on the surface of the target oligos during this in vitro cytotoxic reaction. This may explain our previously observed MHC restriction in this reaction. The findings described here may explain some of the in vivo pathogenic events in EAE.",

However, the effector mechanisms involved in mediating EAE have not been clearly defined. Such mechanisms might be clarified by a better understanding of the interaction of sensitized lymphocytes and oligodendrocytes, the cells responsible for myelin formation and maintenance in the CNS. Several investigators have shown indirect evidences of in vitro damage of oligodendrocytes. Lyman et al. (1987) found that MBP-reactive lymphocytes induced an increased release from CNS organotypic culture of CNPase (cyclic nucleotide phosphatase), a myelin-specific enzyme. Royta et al.

Furthermore, the cell-free supematant fluid obtained at the end of the 6 h incubation period contained no humoral factors cytotoxic to fresh oligos. Tiffs effector-target cell contact dependency has also been observed in other cytotoxic reactions against cell targets (Shaw et al., 1986; Berrebi et al., 1987) . However, increased adherence of lymphoblasts to these cultured oligos is not sufficient by itself for cytotoxic effects. In comparative studies we found that TT-stimulated lymphoblasts adhere as much as the MBP-stimulated lymphoblasts to the oligos. However, only the MBP-reactive lymphoblasts were cytotoxic to these oligos.

Tiffs finding raises the possibility that MHC antigenic determinants are part of the target in the cytotoxic reaction. The cytotoxic action of a number of T cell clones against other cell targets appears to be MHC-class I restricted (Forman, 1987) . However, unlike the target cells in those models, cultured rat oligodendrocytes do not express either class I or class II antigens, as determined by either immunofluorescence or radioimmunoassay studies. Class I but not class II MHC antigens can be induced on oligos previously exposed to activators like y-interferon (Wong et al., 1984; Suzumura et al., 1986a, b) .",

However, after a 6 h incubation of the oligos with the MBP-reactive lymphoblasts + APC + MBP, there was modest expression of MHC-I antigens on many of the oligos in the cytotoxic reaction. The source of the MHC-I antigens seen on these oligos is unclear. It is conceivable that a product released from the lymphoblasts could have stimulated MHC-I expression on the oligos. Indeed, our recent preliminary studies suggest increased MHC-I expression on cultured oligos incubated with the supernatant fluid of the cytotoxic reac-tion. It is also possible that MHC antigens may have been shed from the lymphoblasts or APC (Hale et al., 1981; Hedlund et al., 1984; Meeusen, 1987) . Meeusen (1987) showed that such shed antigen could stimulate a secondary cytotoxic response in the presence of APC. Vass et al. (1984) have speculated that MHC antigens may be bound to altered cells rendering them susceptible to further cytotoxic effects.",

Although we have not seen impressive MHC-II antigen expression on the target oligos either before or after the 6 h incubation in the cytotoxic reaction, it is possible that a low but sufficient level of MHC-II molecules are expressed.

If sufficient numbers of activated MBP-reactive lymphoblasts come in contact with such MBP-presenting cells, the MBP-reactive lymphoblasts could be retained at the sites and directly (or indirectly) damage oligodendrocytes. Whether or not such damage is manifested as frank demyelination in the usual pathologic studies may reflect the intensity of the cellular reaction and/or participation by other immunological events.",
