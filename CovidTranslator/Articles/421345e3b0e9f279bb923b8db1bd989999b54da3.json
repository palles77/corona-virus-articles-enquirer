Indeed, there have been calls for global warming to be viewed as a health threat itself. 5 Part of the problem is that much of the early research into climate change and infectious disease focused on proving how \"coupled\" or \"decoupled\" particular diseases are with climate eff ects. 6 Thus, climate change was often viewed as a unique and discreet driver of disease. 7 Unsurprisingly, this conceptualisation forged an evidence base that is both highly specifi c and often polarised.",

In 1999, the International Red Cross predicted that climate change and poverty would trigger a decade of so-called superdisasters, including disease epidemics. 8 More than two decades later, extreme weather events have caused a range of humanitarian crises. Although a cumulative or multiplier eff ect merging such events into a single superdisaster has not come to pass, the increasing frequency of these events raises the threat of such an occurrence. Similarly, the emergence of a range of global pandemics or panzootics from severe acute respiratory syndrome to highly pathogenic avian infl uenza enables us to envision the potential eff ects on health services of multiple emerging infectious disease events.",

Ascertainment of the scope and direction of these interactions is an essential fi rst step towards better elucidating the eff ect of climate change on infectious disease. Therefore, perhaps it is time for a new \"normal\" in global health that views the human, wildlife, and livestock disease burden in any given geographical area as greater than the sum of its parts. In this approach, understanding the absence of a disease might be as important as identifying the specifi c factors driving disease emergence and transmission. Explorations of the collective disease burden across species might better explain the role and interaction of climate than the current focus on specifi c drivers and individual diseases. In this approach, assessments of risk, vulnerabilities, and interactions across these collective versus absent disease states could begin to forge a wider understanding of the role and eff ect (both present and future) of climate change on disease.",
