While techniques for generating and analyzing genomic data continue to evolve, the fundamental questions during disease outbreaks -where did the virus originate, how is it changing, and where will it go next -remain the same. By detailing the ways in which genomic data can help answer these questions, I hope to provide a resource that may assist study of future viral outbreaks.",

Subsequent sequencing of isolates and identification of SARS coronavirus as the pathogen responsible led to development of sequence-based diagnostics necessary for the remarkable containment of the outbreak [2, [11] [12] [13] . In 1992, viral sequencing was also used to supplement epidemiological investigation when a patient claimed she had contracted HIV through a dental procedure. Phylogenetic analysis of HIV from the dentist and five of his dental patients -which showed that the viruses were closely related -made it clear that the dentist had indeed transmitted HIV to his patients [14] .

Instead of using long amplicons, the amplicon-based sequencing method used in these papers employs a larger number of shorter amplicons (specifically, 35 primer pairs, each creating a~400-nucleotide amplicon) tiled across the Zika virus genome [34] . Shorter amplicons allow for pathogen identification even in degraded or extremely low titer samples, because large intact regions of the genome need not be present. However, many of the other drawbacks of amplicon-based sequencing remain, such as the inability to reliability detect within-host variants ( [31] , see Chapter 4) .",

            "text": "There are two primary methods of rooting phylogenetic trees: midpoint rooting and outgroup rooting. Midpoint rooting is done by finding the longest tip-to-tip distance in the tree and setting the root halfway between these tips. This method assumes that evolutionary rates are constant throughout the tree, meaning the root should be equidistant from all tips (it also assumes contemporaneous sampling). As discussed in the next section, this assumption (known as the molecular clock assumption) is often incorrect. Therefore, viral outbreaks are typically rooted by selecting an outgroup -that is, a set of sequences known to be more distantly related than anything else in the tree. This can be comprised of published sequences from previous outbreaks of the same virus, virus sampled from another host species, or a closely related viral species. Outgroup genomes must be distinct from outbreak genomes, but rooting trees using highly divergent sequences can also be problematic [65] . If only outbreak sequences are available, it is also possible to use a particularly divergent cluster of outbreak sequences as the outgroup, if one exists. Once an outgroup is selected, the phylogenetic tree is reconstructed using these additional sequences; the root is the point of divergence between the outgroup sequences and the rest of the tree (Figure 1.2) . In some cases the root of the tree is ambiguous, as in the recent EBOV outbreak. Dudas & Rambaut [65] explained how viral substitution rates and linear regression can be used to select the most likely root for a viral outbreak. be used to date the true origin of the outbreak. This is done using a strict molecular clock model, which assumes that nucleotide substitutions accumulate at a constant rate [66] . The number of substitutions on each branch of a tree with dated tips can be used to estimate the nucleotide substitution rate, which then can be used to extrapolate backward to the date of origin of a particular outbreak strain [67] . Maximum likelihood methods [68] can calculate substitution rates given a phylogenetic tree and sampling dates.",

Nonrandom sampling over time or space may significantly bias results [73] .

See also Figure B We calculated the fractions of nonsynonymous (NS) and synonymous (S) consensus SNPs and iSNVs within experimentally determined B cell epitopes (data from ViPR [27] ). Dotted line represents the fraction of GP amino acids in ViPR epitopes. Nonsynonymous SNPs (p = 0.004) and iSNVs (p = 0.037) in GP occur more frequently in epitopes than expected by chance (two-sided exact binomial test).

Of these five sequences, two (shown here, samples 20141582 and G5119.1) contain stretches of T-to-C SNPs (blue points) within GP epitopes (light blue bars). Additionally, we observe a T-to-C mutation at amino acid position 485 (blue diamond) in three samples (one shown here, G4955.1), which is otherwise completely conserved among members of all ebolavirus species [28] .

This finding therefore raises the possibility that antibodies might be driving diversifying selection and rapid evolution in this region.

In the case of the current EVD outbreak, EBOV has now maintained fitness while expanding across a much larger space of genetic diversity than in previous EVD outbreaks, the largest of which comprised only 318 human infections. This degree of diversity will undoubtedly affect researchers' ongoing efforts to develop or improve candidate diagnostics, vaccines, and therapeutics for EVD, many of which are targeting EBOV sequences directly (PCR, nucleic-acid based therapeutics) or indirectly (antibody cocktails).",

While not statistically significant because of the small number of SNPs in the region, our observation is in agreement with many previous studies [31, 32] . As the EBOV GP, especially the mucin-like domain, is the target of many antibodies, a plausible hypothesis is that the humoral immune response exerts selective pressure on GP, resulting in an accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations. In support of this hypothesis, regions of GP corresponding to experimentally determined B cell epitopes are significantly enriched in nonsynonymous, but not in synonymous, variants. There are two important caveats to this analysis: (1) these epitopes are determined in vitro and therefore may not be epitopes in vivo if they are not immunodominant, and (2) there is no experimental evidence to suggest that the majority of observed variants disrupt antibody binding to these epitopes.",

This position is indispensable for binding of the protective antibody 14G7 [28] ; the observed variant at this site may therefore be the result of escape from antibody-mediated selection.

[1] , these shared iSNVs can suggest transmission links; because low-frequency variants generally disappear or fix in a population over time [2] , individuals sharing an iSNV are more likely to be close in a transmission chain, assuming the transmission bottleneck is large enough to allow transmission of multiple viruses [3] . However, as noted by Worby et al.

No EBOV sequences yet sampled outside Nigeria descend from the Nigerian EBOV isolates [1, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , indicating containment of EVD cases in Nigeria within the larger outbreak, as also suggested by contact tracing.",

This can be seen in our data in Within-host variants (iSNVs) that are shared between patients can provide a more detailed picture of transmission routes, but our data point out some important caveats about their usefulness. First, detection of iSNVs requires deep sequencing of good-quality samples, and that is not always possible: deep enough sequencing could be achieved for only two-thirds of our sequenced samples. Second, even when iSNV data are available, it may not all be meaningful. Some of the iS-NVs we observed have previously been documented in unrelated data sets from Sierra Leone and Liberia [1, 5, 7] ; these included all eight of the shared iSNVs. Most of our iSNVs, including most shared iSNVs, were low-frequency frameshift insertions or deletions. Because they can disrupt protein structure, they are unlikely to be transmitted. More likely, these iSNVs represent either recurring mutations in highly mutable regions of the EBOV genome or sequencing errors, especially because many of them occur in homopolymer regions. In either case, their value for determining transmission chains is uncertain. More research is necessary to fully make use of within-host genomic data in understanding transmission, including better sequencing coverage for all samples and improved methods to identify false-positives.",

We do not, however, find them in the sample from the index patients, either as consensus SNPs or as iSNVs, despite high sequencing depth. Nor do they appear as consensus SNPs in the other cases derived from the index case, or as iSNVs in the one other case that was deeply sequenced and was sampled around the same time as samples 6 and 9. The explanation may simply be that the variants were present in the index patient but at too low a frequency for us to detect. It is also possible that their frequency changed in the index patient between the time he was sampled and transmission to the other cases, or that they differed across tissues within the patient. Better understanding of the dynamics of within-host evolution and transmission, and of our power to detect iSNVs, would help clarify this issue.",

We analyzed the timing and patterns of introductions into distinct geographic regions; our phylogenetic evidence suggests rapid expansion of the outbreak in Brazil and multiple introductions of outbreak strains into Puerto Rico, Honduras, Colombia, other Caribbean islands, and the continental United States. We find that ZIKV circulated undetected in multiple regions for many months before the first locally transmitted cases were confirmed, highlighting the importance of surveillance of viral infections.

This dataset, which we used for further analysis, includes 110 genomes produced using multiplex PCR amplification (amplicon sequencing) and a subset of 37 genomes produced using hybrid capture (out of 66 attempted). Because these approaches amplify any contaminant ZIKV content, we relied heavily on negative controls to detect artefac- tual sequence, and we established stringent, method-specific thresholds on coverage and completeness for calling high-confidence ZIKV assemblies (Figure 4.1A) . We typically include a water sample (or a sample from a completely different virus, such as EBOV) when preparing samples for sequencing, and thus used ZIKV content in these negative controls as a proxy for the level of contamination present in that particular batch of samples. We used this principle to define inclusion thresholds for ZIKV assemblies generated in this study. Given the significant differences between the hybrid capture and amplicon sequencing methods, we developed a different set of criteria for each method.",

We could have set a unique threshold for every run, but opted for this more conservative measure. For the amplicon sequencing method, we noticed that sequencing assemblies were roughly binary in their median sequencing depth: the best samples had a depth well over 1,000\u00d7, and poor samples generally had a coverage under 100\u00d7. To set the exact threshold of 275\u00d7, we used data from positive controls and ensured that the assembly of every positive control would pass our threshold. As an additional precaution, we required 2,500 unambiguous bases (roughly 25% of the genome) in sequences produced via amplicon sequencing (see also Methods, Section 4.5).",

The majority of the ZIKV genomes from our study fall into four major clades from different geographic regions, for which we estimated a likely date for ZIKV arrival. In each case, the date was months earlier than the first confirmed, locally transmitted case, indicating ongoing local circulation of ZIKV before its detection. In Puerto Rico, the estimated date was 4.5 months earlier than the first confirmed local case [3] ; it was 8 months earlier in Honduras [2] , 5.5 months earlier in Colombia [24] , and 9 months earlier for the Caribbean-continental U.S. clade [4] . In each case, the arrival date rep- Table D .2 for details). Similar temporal gaps between the tMRCA of local transmission chains and the earliest detected cases were seen when chikungunya virus emerged in the Americas [25] . We also observed evidence for several in- . Adaptive mutations are more likely to be found at high frequency or to be seen multiple times, although both effects can also occur by chance. We observed five positions with nonsynonymous mutations at more than 5% minor allele frequency that occurred on two or more branches of the tree (Figure 4 .3B); two of these (at positions 4,287 and 8,991) occurred together and might represent incorrect placement of a Brazil branch in the tree. The remaining three are more likely to represent multiple nonsynonymous mutations; one (at 9,240) appears to involve nonsynonymous mutations to two different alleles.",

We therefore searched for an excess of nonsynonymous mutations in the ZIKV envelope glycoprotein (E). However, the nonsynonymous substitution rate in E proved to be similar to that in the rest of the coding region (Figure 4 .3C, left); moreover, amino acid changes were significantly more conservative in that region than elsewhere (Figure 4 .3C, middle and right).

Using this method, we quickly noticed that very few iSNVs were identified in samples generated by the amplicon sequencing method. Given the substantial differences in sequencing preparation methods, we hypothesized that a different set of requirements may be necessary to accurately filter data generated using this method. Therefore, we removed all filters from both methods and compared the resulting variants, assuming variants generated by hybrid capture and passing the Gire et al. filters to be correct (we call these 'verified' iSNVs). We additionally required a minimum read depth at each iSNV position, with the aim of eliminating difference in coverage as a reason for unmatched calls (see Chapter 2, Figure B .3).",

Low levels of contamination and sequencing error are common contributors to low-frequency variants; these issues are unavoidable with current technologies and must be addressed by computational filtering. Figures 4.4B and Table D .3B show that nearly 75% of variants from hybrid capture sequences failed to replicate, but that this problem disappears when implementing a strand bias filter. However, the low number of variants passing this filter (n=8) suggests that this method may be too conservative, that the samples were not sequenced to high enough read depth for iSNV identification, or that ZIKV may lack substantial within-host variation. Opti-mizing methods and further testing on ZIKV will be required to better understand this result and potentially generate iSNVs useful for studying ZIKV evolution or transmission. Identifying thresholds that successfully filter out spurious variants will be especially useful for amplicon sequencing, and will hopefully generate reliable iSNVs from this method. Notably, in a cultured ZIKV sample with high viral content, both methods produced the same results and were internally consistent at nearly all frequencies (Figure 4 .4C), again suggesting that issues in iSNV identification may be exacerbated by enrichment of low quality samples.",

For the second, we performed a beta regression, using only the observed passing samples, of Y S divided by ZIKV genome length on the predictor variables.

We sampled for 100 path steps with a chain length of 1 million, with power posteriors determined from evenly spaced quantiles of a Beta(alpha=0.3; 1.0) distribution. The Skyline tree prior provided a better fit than the two other (baseline) tree priors (Table D. 2), so we used this tree prior for all further analyses. Using a constant or exponential tree prior, a relaxed clock provides a better model fit, as shown by the log Bayes factor when comparing the two clock models. Using a Skyline tree prior, the log Bayes factor comparing a strict and relaxed clock is smaller than it is using the other tree priors, and it is similar to the variability between estimated log marginal likelihood from PS and SS methods. We chose to use a relaxed clock for further analyses, but we also report key findings using a strict clock.",

Despite detailed epidemiological data collected in the outbreak, MuV sequence data were required to identify multiple co-circulating strains within Massachusetts (and even within single institutions), to connect two outbreaks previously thought to be separate, and to accurately estimate R E within one institution. Additionally, while SH gene sequencing reveals global trends in MuV circulation, analysis based on a single, short gene would not be adequate for producing this kind of detailed picture of how mumps is spreading in the United States ( Figure   E.7) . Not only do these findings reveal transmission patterns in this particular outbreak, they also suggest the presence of undetected mumps circulating within Massachusetts and the United States, and a possible high asymptomatic burden despite widespread immunization. This has implications for vaccination use and recommendations, already under consideration by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [25] .",

We showed that the virus likely entered the country from Liberia, and that EBOV did not spread from Nigeria to other countries, thus confirming the success of the public health response.

Marginal likelihoods calculated with path-sampling (PS) and stepping-stone sampling (SS) for combinations of three coalescent tree priors (constant size population, exponential growth population, and Skyline) and two clock models (strict clock and uncorrelated relaxed clock with log-normal distribution). The Bayes factor is calculated against the baseline model, a constant size tree prior and strict clock. (B) Mean estimates and 95% credible intervals across evaluated models for the clock rate, date of tree root, and tMR-CAs of the four regions shown in Figure 4 .2C. Under a Skyline tree prior, the use of strict and relaxed clock models yields similar estimates. Table E .4. The HN protein sequence does a significantly better job at capturing the epidemiologically-relevant clades than the SH gene, and the tree created from SH+HN+F (nearly 25% of the genome) closely resembles the tree created from whole genome sequences.

Cell, 2015 [5], I describe our follow-up study of EBOV in Sierra Leone, using an additional 232 EBOV genomes collected over seven months. I am a co-first author on this publication and have included the entire text of this collaborative work in this chapter for context, but I have highlighted my specific contributions below. My primary contributions are detailed in Section 2.3.3, 'Human-to-Human Transmission of Multiple EBOV Genomes.' I performed the majority of the intrahost variant (iSNV) analysis, aiming to understand the patterns and prevalence of iSNVs in our dataset (Figures 2.2A, B.3A) and their relationship to sample coverage (Figure B.3B). As described below, these types of analyses helped rule out superinfection and contamination, and led to a more detailed understanding of EBOV transmission (Figures B.3C, 2.2B; the latter figure was generated by Trevor Bedford). In collaboration with Danny Park and Gytis Dudas, I also explored variation at multiple timescales (Section 2.3.4). After noting the higher fraction of nonsynonymous variants in iSNVs as compared to consensus-level variants (Figure 2.3C), we explored the implications of this result on our purification selection hypothesis. I also looked for other evidence for selection or host effects on the viral genome (Section 2.3.5) in collaboration with Gytis Dudas and Aaron Lin. A preliminary d N /d S analysis highlighted the number of nonsynonymous variants within the EBOV glycoprotein, and specifically within the disordered mucin-like region.

Never before has an EBOV variant been transmitted among humans for such a sustained period of time.Published EBOV Makona genomes from clinical samples obtained early in the outbreak in Guinea (three patients) and Sierra Leone (78 patients)[1, 3]  demonstrated that near-real-time sequencing could provide valuable information to researchers involved in the global outbreak response. Analysis of these genomes revealed that the outbreak likely originated from a single introduction into the human population in Guinea at the end of 2013 and was then sustained exclusively by human-to-human transmissions. Genomic sequencing further allowed the identification of numerous mutations emerging in the EBOV Makona genome over time. As a consequence, the evolutionary rate of the Makona variant over the time span of the early phase of the outbreak could be estimated and predictions made about the potential of this new EBOV variant to escape current candidate vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics[15].While the insights gleaned from sequencing early in the outbreak informed public health efforts[16][17][18], the continued human-to-human spread of the virus raises questions about ongoing evolution and transmission of EBOV.

The existence of shared iSNVs could be explained by patient infection from multiple Within and between country genomic relationships of Ebola virus Makona. (A) Phylogenetic and temporal placement of recently sequenced EBOV within Sierra Leone. New EBOV genomes (232 genomes, dark blue), sampled from 16 June through 26 December 2014, provide a high-resolution view of the accumulated genetic diversity and fill in the missing ancestry between EBOV Makona genome datasets. The maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was inferred using Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST), with tips anchored to sampling date. Tips are labeled for EBOV from five non-African health-care workers (HCWs) infected in Sierra Leone and treated in Europe (sequenced by other groups, light green).Previously described nested EBOV Makona lineages SL1, SL2, and SL3 [3], as well as a new lineage SL4, are labeled at their most-recent common ancestor (MRCA) nodes. (B) Lack of EBOV Makona SL3 spread to Liberia or Mali. Shown is a median-joining haplotype network constructed from a coding-complete EBOV genome alignment including 340 EBOV Makona sequences. Each colored vertex represents a sampled viral haplotype, with colors indicating countries of origin. Colors are as in (A), with the exception that the distinction is no longer made between older (Gire) and newer (Park) Sierra Leonean datasets (both are now dark blue), and two additional countries are shown (Liberia in yellow, Mali in red). The size of the each vertex is relative to the number of sampled isolates. Hatch marks indicate the number of mutations along each edge. See also Figures B.1 and B.2. sources (superinfection), sample contamination, recurring mutations (with or without balancing selection to reinforce mutations), or co-transmission of slightly diverged viruses that arose by mutation earlier in the transmission chain. We can rule out superinfection and contamination as primary explanations for the iSNVs in our data because none of the iSNVs are located at common SNP positions. For example, a SNP at position 14,019 is at intermediate frequency in the population (found in approximately 40% of samples we sequenced) and defines the SL4 lineage (Figure 2.1A). If superinfection were common among EVD patients, we would expect to sometimes see both SL3 and SL4 viruses in the same patient, which would appear as an iSNV at that position. Contamination would result in a similar pattern, with intermediate-frequency SNPs appearing as iSNVs in contaminated samples. Additionally, contamination would be most visible in low-coverage, low-RNA-content samples because contaminants would make up more of the RNA available for sequencing, whereas samples with extremely high coverage would be the most visible contaminants (Figure B.3B). The highest coverage sample (G4960.1) contains genomes belonging to lineage SL3 only and lacks the SL4 SNP, so if there were widespread contamination, we would see a low-frequency iSNV at position 14,019 in SL4 samples with iSNVs. Since SL3 and SL4 samples were processed together (eight of nine sequencing batches contained multiple samples from both lineages) and we saw no instances of an iSNV at that position, we conclude that superinfection and contamination are not important contributors to iSNVs.The remaining possible sources for persistently shared iSNVs are co-transmission and recurrent mutation. In either case, the iSNV could be maintained by balancing selection or could be evolving neutrally.Figure 2.2A suggests that selection is not the primary cause of persistence, since",

(A) Certain iSNVs appear in samples throughout the EVD epidemic, suggesting that iSNVs can be transmitted between patients. Variants shared between two or more samples are shown as rows of connected points; each row is a genomic position (ordered by position along the genome, top to bottom), and each point indicates the presence of the iSNV in a patient. (B) Phylogenetic placement of derived alleles at genomic position 18,911 implies both repeated transmission within clades as well as some amount of recurrent mutation. Colored tips are sized according to frequency of iSNV at position 18,911. Tips with small black points are those with iSNV calls at any position; other tips represent samples with no iSNV calls. This figure shows only the portion of the tree relevant for this analysis; large branches with no SNPs or iSNVs at position 18,911 are not shown. See also Figure B.3. synonymous and nonsynonymous variants are equally common among the shared iSNVs, and selective pressures are likely to be different for the two classes of variant. All shared iSNVs are unlikely to be simply the product of recurring mutation: if they were, they should have a frequency spectrum heavily weighted toward low frequency, characteristic of new mutations. However, that is not the case. For example, the variant at position 18,911 is found at >15% frequency in eight different samples (Figure B.3C), a much higher frequency than expected if the change represented a de novo mutation in each sample. In summary, we conclude that a combination of human-to-human transmission and recurrent mutations is likely responsible for the iSNV pattern observed in Figure 2.2A. This hypothesis is supported by the iSNV at position 18,911: samples containing this variant often cluster on the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2.2B), although more isolated samples may represent separate mutation events. More generally, pairs of samples that share an iSNV are typically located near one another phylogenetically; these pairs are separated by an average of 0.16 years of evolution, whereas random pairs are separated by an average of 0.30 years (p < 10 \u22124 , randomization test). These results suggest transmission of iSNVs in at least some cases and therefore suggest that the transmission bottleneck is wide enough to facilitate the transmission of low-or intermediate-frequency variants between hosts.",

How purifying selection acts at different timescales can also be seen in the distribution of mutations in the EBOV Makona genealogy. Deleterious mutations are more likely to result in transmission-impaired viruses and dead-end infections and may therefore only be present in individual patients. Mutations unique to individual patients are those that occur on the external branches of the phylogenetic tree, whereas internal branch mutations are those present in multiple samples in our dataset. Thus, in the model of incomplete purifying selection, we expect ex-ternal branches to be characterized by a higher rate of nonsynonymous substitution than internal branches; in the latter, selection has had more opportunity to filter out deleterious mutants. Internal branches, by definition, have produced multiple descendent lineages and are thus less likely to non-synonymous rate (subs year )",

Nonsynonymous mutations indeed occurred at lower frequency on internal than on external branches, suggesting that most are removed by purifying selection because of their fitness costs and hence represent evolutionary dead ends. Synonymous mutations, which likely have less impact on fitness, occurred at more comparable frequencies on internal and external branches.The relationship between the effectiveness of purifying selection and its duration is also ap-parent in the overall pattern of nonsynonymous mutations in our dataset. Selection filters the accumulation of coding variants in the EBOV genome (Figures 2.3C and 2.4A ). Nonsynonymous mutations, which are more likely to be deleterious, make up a decreasing fraction of coding mutations as we analyze longer timescales: intrahost variants > individual patients (external branches) > multiple patients (internal branches) > between outbreaks. The fraction seen between outbreaks represents the effect of long periods of evolution in the unknown EBOV reservoir. As selection acts to remove deleterious alleles over time, fewer nonsynonymous mutations can be detected. This pattern holds true across the EBOV Makona genome (Figure 2.4A).",

Our reconstructed phylogeny (Figure 4.2B), which is based on a molecular clock (Figure D.2), is consistent with the outbreak having originated in Brazil [1]: Brazil ZIKV genomes appear on all deep branches of the tree, and their most recent common ancestor is the root of the entire tree.

Following our work on reconstructing transmission during the EBOV outbreak in Nigeria, we hoped to apply a similar approach to another outbreak for which we could obtain comprehensive contact tracing data. The close proximity of the MuV outbreak -hundreds of cases were reported in Massachusetts in 2016-2017 -and the efforts of the local university health services and Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) to trace patients and record epidemiological information made it a perfect subject for this type of analysis. Proximity to the outbreak also eliminated issues related to sample transfer, ensuring the availability of high-quality samples for sequencing. Additionally, access to high-quality samples created an opportunity to further study within-host variation, which we could do only in a limited fashion with the lower quality EBOV samples from Nigeria.Beyond these methodological goals, we hoped to use MuV sequences to answer public health questions about the nature of the MuV outbreak. We sought to understand the presence of MuV in highly vaccinated university communities, how the virus got into Massachusetts, and the extent to which genomic data could be used to trace transmission within and between university communities. These questions are answered in the text below, which has been adapted from a draft manuscript we plan to submit for publication in the coming weeks.While I have been the main driver of this mumps project, there are many people who have contributed immensely to the work presented below. I optimized our sequencing protocol (see [1]) for MuV with Anne Piantadosi, Katie Siddle, and Chris Matranga, and sequenced over 200 MuV samples with help from Katie Siddle, Bettina Bankamp, Rickey Shah, and James Qu. Bridget Chak and I worked closely with Meagan Burns (MDPH) to collate epidemiological data from the outbreak for use in transmission analyses. Hayden Metsky performed most of the phylogenetic analysis in BEAST, as well as a meta-analysis of SH gene data. Steve Schaffner and I analyzed withinand between-host variation of MuV, and Anne Piantadosi and Bridget Chak have been instrumental in exploring the potential of these mutations to confer vaccine escape. This project would not have happened without our close collaboration with the MDPH, fostered by my advisor Pardis Sabeti, Nathan Yozwiak, Danny Park, and others, as well as the vision of Sandy Smole, Larry Madoff and our other MDPH collaborators. Yonatan Grad has also been extremely important to both envisioning the project at its start, as well as discussing every aspect of the analysis. The manuscript below has been primarily written by me, Bronwyn MacInnis, Steve Schaffner, Nathan Yozwiak, Hay-den Metsky, and Anne Piantadosi and, in our opinion, demonstrates the true potential of genomics to influence public health measures during and after viral outbreaks. vaccination, thousands of mumps cases were reported in the United States in 2016-2017, including hundreds in Massachusetts, primarily in college settings. We generated 203 whole genome sequences of mumps virus (MuV) from Massachusetts and 15 other states to understand the dynamics of mumps spread locally and nationally, as well as to search for mutations associated with vaccine escape. We observed multiple lineages of MuV circulating withinMassachusetts during the outbreak, evidence for multiple introductions of the virus to the state, and extensive geographic movement of MuV within the country on short time scales. We found no association between MuV lineage and vaccine status, and little evidence that mutations that arose during this outbreak contributed to vaccine escape.

While most MuV in Massachusetts falls within this 2006 lineage, we are able to detect small transmission clusters within the outbreak that resulted from importation events from elsewhere: three clades contained MuV sequences distinct from the majority of Massachusetts sequences, and each had at least one MuV sequence from a patient with foreign travel history during the incubation period of the virus. The sequence data resolved details of the outbreak at finer scales as well, showing that multiple clades were also co-circulating within individual academic institutions. For example, there were two viral lineages in samples associated with Institution K (clades II and K*) and multiple viral lineages in samples from Institution B-associated individuals (clades I, II, and B*) (Figure E.3A).",

The comprehensive sampling at Institution A again allowed us to combine genomic and epidemiology data to better understand the outbreak dynamics, this time by estimating the number of mumps introductions into the university. Detailed epidemiological data alone were inadequate to determine whether the initial effective reproductive number, R E (t=0), within the university exceeded the critical threshold of 1.0 (Figures 5.2B left, E.4). However, incorporating the number of distinct viral lineages observed markedly improved our ability to infer transmission dynamics within the institution, supporting an estimate of five (95% CI: 4-18) distinct introductions that were each expected to cause R E (t=0)=1.70 (95% CI: 1.50-1.91) secondary cases (Figure 5.2B right).",

Because the infected individual had no known Ebola virus-positive contacts, and because molecular diagnostic methods could not differentiate between outbreak lineages, whole-genome sequencing was needed to identify the most likely source of infection.As shown by these examples, viral genomic sequencing can be a vital tool for detailed transmission reconstruction when contact tracing data is missing or uninformative. Genetic data can also be used to identify general transmission patterns and to estimate epidemiological parameters.Figure 1.4: Determining virus transmission.

In the absence of selection, these two rates should be the same (corrected for the frequency of each type of site). Nonsynonymous substitutions are more likely to affect the resulting protein and are therefore more likely to influence fitness.

            "text": "Containment limited the 2014 Nigerian EBOV disease outbreak to 20 reported cases and eight fatalities. We present here clinical data and contact information for at least 19 case patients, and fulllength EBOV genome sequences for 12 of the 20. The detailed contact data permits nearly complete reconstruction of the transmission tree for the outbreak. The EBOV genomic data are consistent with that tree. It confirms that there was a single source for the Nigerian infections, shows that the Nigerian EBOV lineage nests within a lineage previously seen in Liberia but is genetically distinct from it, and supports the conclusion that transmission from Nigeria to elsewhere did not occur.The 2014 outbreak of EBOV disease (EVD) in Nigeria was one branch of the major West African epidemic that spanned 2014-2016. As of 13 March 2016, a total of 28,639 EVD cases and 11,316 deaths had been reported in 10 countries. The majority of EVD burden occurred in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, with exported cases responsible for additional transmissions in the United States, Mali, and Nigeria, and diagnosed cases with no transmissions in the United Kingdom, Italy, Senegal, and Spain[6].The Nigeria EVD outbreak began on 20 July 2014, when a traveler from Liberia (the index case patient), who was infected with EBOV, arrived by commercial aircraft to Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos. The traveler's movement was quickly restricted, patient samples were confirmed EBOV positive by independent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests within days, and intensive contact tracing was conducted. The Nigeria EVD outbreak ended on 20 October 2014, when the country was declared Ebola free by the World Health Organization. During that period, 20 individuals are reported to have been infected, of whom eight died.Despite emerging in the megacity of Lagos, the Nigeria EVD outbreak was well documented and well contained because of rapid detection of the index case and thorough contact tracing throughout the outbreak. Contact tracing provides a detailed understanding of viral spread, which is key to controlling any viral outbreak. Sequencing of patient samples can also be used to understand transmission routes and is especially important in cases where contact tracing is not available, or when contact tracing cannot completely resolve a transmission chain.The EVD outbreak in Nigeria is unique because both genetic and contact tracing data are available. The complete transmission chain could be reconstructed with considerable confidence, and detailed clinical records were available for most patients. Viral sequencing data and sampling dates can be used to estimate general transmission patterns between patients and regions, and are used in this case to confirm and inform the transmission chain suggested by contact tracing.Comparing the two methods highlights the strengths of each, and the importance of both contact tracing and genomic sequencing during an outbreak.We present here an account of the Nigeria 2014 EVD outbreak that includes clinical, epidemi-ological, and viral sequence data for most of the affected patients. We also describe sequencing results generated in Nigeria and in duplicate in the United States for the purposes of both outbreak investigation and validation of viral sequencing capabilities in new laboratories.Symptoms and outcome for all 20 patients are summarized in Tables C.1 and C.2. Their median age was 33 years (range, 26-62 years), and 55% were female. Most (65%) were <40 years of age, and most (65%) were health workers. At presentation, the most common symptoms were fever (85%), fatigue (70%), and diarrhea (65%). The pulse rate and blood pressure were within normal range in 50% of the patients, but the respiratory rate was elevated in 90% of those with available data. The common clinical syndromes documented were gastroenteritis (45%), hemorrhage (30%), and encephalopathy (15%). Of 20 patients, 12 (60%) survived, with one having a post-illness mental health complication requiring follow-up. The mean (standard deviation) duration from onset of symptoms to presentation at the ETC was three (two) days among survivors, compared with five (two) days for non-survivors. The mean duration from symptom onset to death or discharge from the Ebola treatment center (ETC) was 15 (five) days for survivors and 11 (two) days for non-survivors.We prepared 16 samples from 13 of the 20 patients with confirmed EVD and discharge samples for three of them. This includes case 9, which could not be confidently matched to a sample (suspected match to E030). We prepared an additional 16 samples from suspected cases in which the sample could not be clearly associated with a particular case because of incomplete records. Because these data include retested and discharge samples, as well as incomplete information collated many months after the outbreak, we were not able to confirm that there were exactly 20 EVD cases in Nigeria. After inactivation and extraction at RUN, we divided RNA from each sample into two aliquots for independent library preparation and sequencing at RUN and the Broad Institute.Extracted RNA samples contained an average of 3.97 \u00d7 10 6 18S copies/mL (range, 3.28 \u00d7 10 4 to 2.31 \u00d7 10 7 copies/mL) as determined by qRT-PCR.We prepared Nextera libraries for all 32 samples. Using the Kulesh qRT-PCR assay, we detected EBOV RNA in 18 of these samples, including two discharge samples and three samples unassociated with a particular case. After library construction, we used Kulesh qPCR to detect the presence of any EBOV copies in the libraries. Based on the results, we sequenced 23 samples using a combination of the MiSeq and HiSeq 2500 platforms (Illumina). We were able to generate assembled EBOV genomes from 12 of these samples, all from confirmed EVD cases with associated case histories. We combined the MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing data from RUN and the Broad Institute for analysis. The median sequencing coverage was 225.5\u00d7 (range, 6-4,864\u00d7) (Table 3.1). Although we recorded combined sequencing data, the MiSeq data from RUN separately confirmed EBOV reads in six of the 12 samples with assembled EBOV genomes. We identified 17 consensus-level variants (nine synonymous, five nonsynonymous, three noncoding, all relative to the earliest EBOV sequence from the West African outbreak (GenBank accession KJ660346.2)) in EBOV genomes from the 12 sequencing-positive Nigerian samples(Table 3.2). Variants characteristic of the LB5 (Liberia sublineage 5)[7]  were shared by all Nigeria EBOV genomes.The Nigerian EBOV genomes also shared three variants not common in Liberia, at positions 4,037, 17,016, and 18,754(Table 3.2). These variants were present in all Nigerian samples sequenced, including the index case (we note that two samples did not have coverage at position 18,574). Two of these variants were unique to Nigeria, and one variant, at position 18,754, was also seen in two EBOV genomes from Liberia (accessions KT725314 and KT725261), suggesting a close relationship of the Nigeria clade to those samples.

The lack of available ZIKV sequences my also be explained by loss of RNA integrity in samples collected and stored without sequencing in mind. Culturing the virus increases the material available for sequencing but can result in genetic variation that is not representative of the original clinical sample.We sought to gain a deeper understanding of the viral populations underpinning the ZIKV epidemic by extensive genome sequencing of the virus directly from samples collected as part of ongoing surveillance. We initially pursued unbiased metagenomic sequencing to capture both ZIKV and other viruses known to be co-circulating with ZIKV[19]. In most of the 38 samples examined by this approach there proved to be insufficient ZIKV RNA for genome assembly, but it still proved valuable to verify results from other methods. Metagenomic data also revealed sequences from other viruses, including 41 likely novel viral sequence fragments in mosquito pools",

Namely, we considered only sequences sampled in 2010 or afterward and collapsed the locations used earlier to just four regions: United States (consisting of only samples from the United States), Europe (consisting of samples whose location was labeled as Eastern Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Western Europe, or the United Kingdom), East Asia (consisting of samples whose location was labeled as Eastern Asia or Japan), and South/Southeast Asia (consisting of samples whose location was labeled as Southeast Asia or Southern Asia). We ignored samples from the five locations not used here (Canada; Caribbean, Central America, and South America; Middle and Eastern Africa; Northern Africa; Middle East). Then, we randomly sampled 10 sequences (without replacement) from each region for each year (i.e.,[2010][2011][2011][2012], and so on). We resampled the input sequences with this strategy 100 times.Note that sampling biases affect this resampling strategy as well. Notably, several years in the East Asia and the South/Southeast Asia regions have fewer than 10 sequences (sometimes, zero)",

A number of recent studies, including our ZIKV study, have addressed validation of iSNVs across replicate studies[7, 8]  and methods for improving variant identification[9]. Sequencing samples with known variant frequencies (created by mixing different virus strains or synthetic oligonucleotides at various frequencies) could help generalize these methods. Sequencing at various read depths would also be important, since I have observed a clear correlation between depth and iSNV detection.
