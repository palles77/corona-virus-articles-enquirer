Infection control practices are geared towards reduction of occurrence and transmission of infectious diseases. Objective: To evaluate knowledge and attitudes of infection prevention and control among Health Science students at University of Namibia. Methods: To assess students' knowledge and attitudes regarding infection prevention and control and their sources of information, a self-administered questionnaire was used to look at standard precautions especially hands hygiene. Results: One hundred sixty two students participated in this study of which 31 were medical, 17 were radiography and 114 were nursing students. Medical students had better overall scores (73%) compared to nursing students (66%) and radiology students (61%). There was no significant difference in scores between sexes or location of the high school being either in rural or urban setting. Conclusion: Serious efforts are needed to improve or review curriculum so that health sciences students' knowledge on infection prevention and control is imparted early before they are introduced to the wards.",

Soon after, Finnish missionaries set up several clinics in the north. Training of professional nurses was offered through the Nursing colleges in Oshakati and Windhoek hospitals until 1985. As a move in higher education became eminent, the Academy for Tertiary Education was established. The Faculty of Medical and Health Science was established at the Academy in January 1986 after a need was identified to train professional nurses in Namibia instead of depending on South Africa. This was the first University component for the Academy of the then South West Africa, now Namibia, in training health professionals. The Faculty offered mainly nursing sciences programmes until 1996 when the National Diploma in Radiography was introduced with the assistance of the World Health Organization. After independence, the University of Namibia (UNAM) was established by Act of Parliament (Act 82 of 1992) on the 1 st of September 1992. A commission was set up to look into the issues of tertiary education in Namibia in 1991. One of its recommendations was to set up a consultative body to establish programmes for the Health Sciences. As such it recommended that a feasibility study for the development of the school of medicine should be undertaken. WHO was requested to support this initiative and a consultant was recruited, a report written but it was never implemented. However, in 2000 the UNAM introduced a pre-medical programme to prepare students in their first two years for medicine and pharmacy. After the premedical programme, the students were sent to medical universities in the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC). The first intake for the School of Medicine started in 2010 with an intake of 55 students. In 2013, it was established and soon the School of Public Health within the Faculty of Health Sciences.",

For the purpose of this study the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) students, nurses and radiographer students were regarded generally as health sciences students. Students were selected through non probability convenience sampling. A pre-designed, pre-tested, anonymous self-administered, semi-structured questionnaire was given to each student who had an informed consent to take part in the study. This questionnaire was adapted from a previous study done in France in four healthcare schools at Rouen University 1 . The questionnaire was pretested with more than ten respondents that included all students categories at the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Namibia. The survey was found suitable for use by Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America in data collection. We have made necessary revisions and adaptation to Namibia context. The questionnaire was composed of two parts. The first part collected demographics of the students and the second part evaluated whether the current infection control and practices were in line with standard precautions recommended by World Health Organization (WHO). 7 The range of possible scores was 0 to 100. The survey and data collection received the approval of the ethics committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences.",

Further, it may not translate into good hand washing practice if the uptake is poor. Marie-Pierre Tavolacci et al. recommended including pragmatic presentation of effective hand hygiene and standard precautions, feedback from teachers at the bedside, and inclusion of hygiene scores for students in all clinical training courses. They also recommend the strengthening of teaching, particularly with respect to the application of standard precautions for every patient, hand hygiene after use of gloves, and the benefit of using alcohol-based hand rub to decrease the transmission of nosocomial infection 1 . Most students interviewed appreciated the knowledge and attitude toward IPCs and were eager to learn. They however attributed the low knowledge and attitude to lack of initiating IPCs early in the beginning of the course.",

The Faculty of Health Sciences should stress the importance of hand washing among health sciences students and should make it compulsory that health sciences students carry alcohol sanitizers. In conjunction with the recent rise of pandemics, hospitals should take initiative to mandate infection control guidelines to students before entering the wards. Ministry of Health and Social Services in conjunction with hospitals should intensify hand washing in clinical settings. Teaching methods should be improved or modified to increase knowledge of infection control Inter-professional approach to learning about significance of hand-washing should be encouraged.",
