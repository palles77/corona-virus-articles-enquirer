The model reproduces all clinical signs of measles, but the lack of ferret-specific reagents has limited the characterization of the cellular immune response. Towards this, we cloned ferret cytokines and established semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays. To demonstrate the utility of these assays we compared the cytokine profiles elicited by lethal and non-lethal strains during the prodromal phase. We observed a general lack of cytokine induction in animals that later succumbed to the disease, whereas survivors mounted a robust and sustained response. The newly developed cytokine assays strengthen and expand the ferret model not only for Morbillivirus pathogenesis studies but also for several other human respiratory viruses including influenza and SARS.",

Ferrets are highly sensitive to the disease, and for the most part succumb to infection with a wild type virus. On the other hand, infection with attenuated CDV strains results in disease signs and progression that parallels MV infection in humans (Kauffman, Bergman, and O'Connor, 1982) . Virus control and clearance in surviving animals usually occurs within three to four weeks after inoculation and coincides with the development of neutralizing antibodies (von Messling, Milosevic, and Cattaneo, 2004; von Messling et al., 2003) . The application of our model to study the immune response during the crucial early phase of CDV infection has so far been difficult, as specific reagents to detect cytokine responses in ferrets are not readily available.",

As mustelids, ferrets are most closely related to other carnivores like dogs and cats (McKenna and Bell, 1997) . The first set of primers was therefore based on canine and feline sequences available in Genbank. We initially obtained small fragments of ferret IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL2, IL4, IL6, and TNF\u03b1, and used those sequences to measure cytokine mRNA induction using a gel-based assay (von Messling, Svitek, and Cattaneo, 2006) . To develop a robust and versatile real-time PCR-based assay that generates a representative cytokine profile, we included IL10 and IL12p40 and pursued the sequencing of larger parts of the open reading frames. This strategy has so far yielded complete open reading frames for IL2, IL4, IL6, IFN\u03b1 (consensus sequence), and TNF\u03b1 (GenBank accession nos. to be submitted), and partial gene sequences for IL10 and IFN\u03b3 (>95), and IL12p40 (\u223c60%; GenBank accession nos. to be submitted). When comparing the ferret cytokines with the respective canine and feline proteins, we observed a slightly higher overall amino acid identity between ferrets and dogs than between ferrets and cats (Table 1) . This degree of similarity on the amino acid and nucleotide level (data not shown) confirms the identity of the obtained sequences.",

Samples included in the lethal group originated from animals infected with either 5804P-eGFP/H (von Messling, Milosevic, and Cattaneo, 2004) or A75eH (Rudd, Cattaneo, and von Messling, 2006) , whereas the survivor group consisted of individuals inoculated with the highly pathogenic but non-lethal strain 5804P-eGFP/uN (von Messling, Milosevic, and Cattaneo, 2004) or survivors of 5804P/A75eH chimeric viruses. These viruses, in which the envelope glycoproteins were exchanged between the two lethal strains, cause severe disease, but only 60-80% mortality (unpublished results). In the case of 5804P-eGFP/uN, which carries an eGFP-containing additional transcription unit upstream of the N gene, the non-lethal phenotype is due to a slight delay in replication efficacy, whereas minimal incompatibilities between viral proteins originating from different strains are the likely cause of survival in the case of the 5804P/A75 chimeric viruses.",

In addition, the non-essential protein V has been shown to inhibit activation of an anti-viral response by interfering with nuclear localization of STATs (Devaux et al., 2006; Palosaari et al., 2003) . It is possible that the shut down of cytokine expression observed for the lethal CDV strains results from contacts between viral glycoproteins and immune cells in combination with a V and phosphoproteindependent inhibition of the induction of the anti-viral state in infected cells.

By comparing samples from animals with different disease outcome, we have demonstrated that our semi-quantitative real-time PCR assays are sufficiently sensitive to detect a very weak response and even a reduction from baseline levels as observed in animals that later succumbed to the disease. At the same time, the assays allow the quantification of the response across a much wider range than the previous gel-based approach (von Messling, Svitek, and Cattaneo, 2006) . This will enable the more detailed comparison of the cytokine responses to specifically attenuated viruses in future studies. Furthermore, this RNA-based assay can easily be applied to various tissues as well as bodily fluids, enabling the assessment of the local and systemic responses at the same time.

The real-time PCR was performed in a RG-3000A (Rotor-Gene), using the following protocol: denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5s, 60\u00b0C for 15s, and 72\u00b0C for 25s, and a melting curve analysis to confirm reaction specificity. Each experiment was performed in triplicate, and only values that varied less than 10% were considered. The fold change ratios between experimental and control samples for each gene were calculated with GAPDH levels as a reference. Towards this the cycle at which GAPDH crosses the detection threshold (Ct) is substracted from the Ct value of the gene of interest at each time point (\u0394Ct). The fold change is then calculated by substracting the \u0394Ct values of the respective gene at day 0 from those obtained at subsequent days (\u0394\u0394Ct). To transform these values into absolute values, the formula: fold change = 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct is used (Schmittgen et al., 2000) . Clinical parameters in animals infected with lethal or non-lethal CDV strains. (A) Leukocyte numbers, (B) in vitro proliferation activity of lymphocytes, (C) cell-associated virus titers expressed in 50% log 10 tissue culture infectious doses (TCID 50 ) in PBMCs, and (D) neutralizing antibody titers over the first 21 days of the disease. Animals infected with the lethal strains 5804P-eGFP/H (n=5) or A75eH (n=6) are represented by circles, those infected with the non-lethal virus 5804P-eGFP/uN (n=4) and the survivors of infections with chimeric 5804P/A75eH envelope exchange viruses (n=4) by triangles. Days post-infection are indicated on the X axis, leukocyte number, proliferation activity, cell-associated virus titer, or neutralizing antibody titer on the Y axis. Error bars represent the standard deviation. The narrow dotted lines indicate cut-off values associated with moderate (upper line) and severe (lower line) immunosuppression. The wider dotted line represents the protective threshold of neutralizing antibodies. Comparison of cytokine responses in animals infected with lethal or non-lethal CDV strains. (A) innate immunity, (B) Th1-type, and (C) Th2-type cytokine mRNA expression in both groups at three (D3) and seven (D7) days post infection. Animals infected with lethal strains (n=11) are represented by circles, those infected with non-lethal viruses (survivors; n=8) by triangles. The fold mRNA expression change compared to pre-infection levels of the same animal is indicated on the Y axis. Each samples was analyzed in triplicates and only samples where the variation among triplicates was less than 10 % were included in the analysis, resulting in the variability in numbers of individuals plotted for the different cytokines. The black bar represents the mean of all the samples. The hatched zone represents threshold levels of 1.5 fold expression change, which is considered normal variability.

Error bars represent the standard deviation. (B) Relative percentages of PBMC subtypes infected 0 to 14 days after infection with lethal or non-lethal viruses.
