            "text": "Background: The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly recognized zoonotic coronavirus. Current evidence confirms the role of dromedaries in primary human infections but does not explain the sporadic community cases. However, asymptomatic or subclinical cases could represent a possible source of infection in the community. Methods: Archived human sera (7461) collected between 2011 and 2016 from healthy adult blood donors from 50 different nationalities in the western part of Saudi Arabia were obtained for MERS-CoV seroprevalence investigation. Samples were tested for MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies (Abs) by ELISA and confirmed by testing for neutralizing Abs (nAbs) using both pseudotyped and live virus neutralization assays. Results: Out of 7461 samples, 174 sera from individuals with 18 different nationalities were ELISA positive (2.3%, 95% CI 2.0-2.7). Presence of nAbs was confirmed in 17 samples (0.23%, 95% CI 0.1-0.4) of which one sample exhibited positivity in both neutralization assays. Confirmed seropositivity was identified in young (15-44 years) men and women from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference. Conclusions: An increasing trend of MERS-CoV seroprevalence was observed in the general population in western Saudi Arabia, suggesting that asymptomatic or mild infections might exist and act as an unrecognized source of infection. Seropositivity of individuals from different nationalities underscores the potential MERS exportation outside of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, enhanced and continuous surveillance is highly warranted.",

While some studies have shown some seropositivity in common non-camelid livestock species such as sheep and goats suggesting a possible role of these animals in MERS-CoV transmission, especially when they are in contact with infected camels [9, 16, 17] , further studies are required to confirm these findings. Therefore, current epidemiological data highly suggest that infected camels could be the main source of primary zoonotic human cases. However, many sporadic presumably primary cases reported no contact or exposure history with camels, and thus a clear epidemiological link of transmission is not well-established [5, 6] . Furthermore, despite the fact that most secondary cases were due to human-tohuman spread in household and/or healthcare settings [2, 3] , there is no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, and the virus does not seem to pass easily between humans [18, 19] .",

            "text": "As of December 2019, more than 2499 laboratory-confirmed human cases have been reported from 27 countries with \u223c35% mortality [20] . However, this seems to be an overestimation of the true mortality rate as mild and asymptomatic MERS cases might be missed during routine testing and can only be identified via enhanced molecular, serological, and immunological surveillance [4] [5] [6] 21, 22] . Such cases are usually more common among camel handlers as well as household individuals and/or healthcare workers who are in contact with MERS patients [4, 5, [22] [23] [24] [25] . Furthermore, while few early small studies have reported no serological evidence of MERS-CoV in children, abattoir workers, veterinarians, animal handlers and even unexposed individuals in Saudi Arabia [15, [26] [27] [28] , at least one large cross-sectional study has revealed \u223c0.15% seropositivity in the general Saudi population [5] . Similarly, a study from Qatar showed that 0.21% of the general population were seropositive by ELISA screening of 4719 blood donors however the presence of nAbs was only confirmed in one blood donor (0.02%) [29] . Interestingly, despite the high prevalence of MERS-CoV in camels from different countries such as Kenya, Nigeria, Egypt and Pakistan, confirmed evidence of MERS cases among humans is very limited in these countries except for two seropositive camel handlers in Kenya [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] 30] . Such data clearly suggest that unknown asymptomatic and subclinical MERS infections or even unrecognized cases might in fact exist in the general population and could represent an underappreciated source of human-to-human transmission. Therefore, it is essential to conduct continuous and enhanced surveillance and epidemiological studies to determine MERS-CoV prevalence especially in endemic regions.",

Notably, testing a large number of rS1-ELISA negative samples by these confirmatory assays showed no false negative results further confirming the validity of our inhouse developed indirect rS1-ELISA with a 100% sensitivity and even higher specificity (97.9%) compared to our previous report [31] . Cases were confirmed in individuals between the age of 15-44 years with highest rate in the 25-34 age group, however there was no statistical differences between the groups (Table 3 ). Based on confirmed cases, no significant difference was observed between men (16 [0.26%] of 6183 and women 1 [0.21%] of 475) using Fisher's exact test. Furthermore, confirmed seropositivity was identified in individuals from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Yemen, Pakistan, Palestine, Sudan, and India without significant preference (Table 4 ). While proportion of confirmed infected cases was higher in this study Table 2 Seroprevalence of MERS-CoV in blood donors based on year of collection.

Several epidemiological studies have proven MERS-CoV endemicity in dromedaries, which can be in close contact with humans in the Arabian Peninsula and Africa. While contact with MERS-CoV shedding camels could be the main cause of primary cases in the Arabian Peninsula, such transmission cannot explain all laboratory confirmed infections in humans. Thus, it was proposed that asymptomatic or mild cases in the general population could act as an unrecognized source of infection in these endemic regions [4] [5] [6] 22] . Nonetheless, only limited number of reports have investigated MERS-CoV seroprevalence in the general populations especially in endemic regions [5, 25, 29] . Therefore, active and enhanced surveillance is pivotal in order to better understand the true burden of MERS-CoV.",

These samples were collected from healthy individuals from 50 different nationalities who donated blood at a major tertiary hospital between 2011 and 2016. Our data showed an evidence of MERS-CoV S1-specific binding Abs in 2.3% of the tested cohort (174/7461) in which seroprevalence increased over the years. Interestingly, binding Abs were detected in individuals from 18 different countries, suggesting that such individuals could be responsible for MERS-CoV exportation outside the Arabian Peninsula. Consistent with previous reports [4, 5, 29] , nAbs were only confirmed in 9.8% of these rS1-ELISA positive serum samples (17/174) obtained mostly from Saudi men and resulting in a confirmed seroprevalence of 0.23% in the general population in the western region of Saudi Arabia. This confirmed seroprevalence is higher than the previously reported rates in the general Saudi population (0.15%) as well as the population in the western region of the country (0.00%) in 2013, although no statistical significances were observed between the two studies.",

            "text": "It is important to note that the possibility of asymptomatic or mild infections in the remaining non-confirmed rS1-ELISA 157 individuals cannot be overlooked. This is mostly because of the high specificity of ppNT and MNT assays [16, 33] that could result in reduced sensitivity in the testing algorithm as well as the high sensitivity of rS1-ELISA (at least 10-fold more sensitive) and so could actually be detecting S1-binding but non-neutralizing Abs. Furthermore, while cross-reactive low-affinity IgG against other coronaviruses cannot be completely excluded in ELISA [29] , MERS-CoV S1 has low homology and cross-reactivity with S1 subunit from other known coronaviruses [33, 34] . Thus, it could be postulated that some of these young and healthy individuals between the age of 15-44 years might have been indeed exposed to MERS-CoV but only suffered from subclinical infections and mounted transient and weak nAb responses that might wane quickly resulting in false negative results by neutralization assays. This is partially true as it was recently demonstrated that not all individuals with history of MERS infection including high-risk groups could elicit detectable nAbs [21, 22] . Another possibility is that antigenically diverse MERS-CoV strains are circulating and thus not all binding Abs are cross-neutralizing. Therefore, prospective seroepidemiological studies should combine serological and immunological methods in order to determine the actual disease burden caused by asymptomatic or subclinical cases acting as an unidentified intermediate source for virus transmission in the population.",

Nonetheless, we observed higher overall rate of confirmed seropositivity (0.23; 95% CI 0.1-0.4) compared to the previously reported nation-wide seroprevalence rate (0.15; 95% CI 0.1-0.2) in which cases seem to increase over the years [5] . Similarly, extrapolation of our results also indicates that there could be around 19,000 seropositive individuals out of the total population of 8,325,304 in the western region alone in 2016. Such number is of huge concern especially that this region hosts one of the largest mass gathering events (Hajj and Umrah), where the continuous travel of people and movement of livestock to and from the western part of Saudi Arabia could represent a possible way for MERS-CoV infection and exportation by human-to-human or zoonotic transmission.",
