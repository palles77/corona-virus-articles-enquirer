After sequencing of the complete S1 gene, phylogenetic analysis was performed and this found that the Thai IBV isolates were divided into three distinct groups, unique to Thailand (group I), QX-like IBV (group II), and Massachusetts type (group III). This finding indicated that the recent Thai IBVs evolved separately and that at least three groups of viruses are circulating in Thailand. The recombination analysis of the S1 gene demonstrated that the 5 0 -terminus of the group I was similar to isolate THA001 which was unique to Thailand, isolated in 1998 whereas the 3 0 -terminus was similar to the group II. Moreover, the analysis of the S1 gene of the group II showed that the 5 0 -terminus was similar to QXIBV, isolated in China whereas the remaining region at the 3 0 -terminus was similar to the Chinese strain JX/99/01. The results indicated that the recombination events occurred in the S1 gene between the field strains. Based on these facts, the field IBV in Thailand has undergone genetic recombination.",

The disease is characterized by respiratory signs including gasping, coughing, sneezing, tracheal rales, and nasal discharge [1] . All ages of chickens are susceptible to IBV infection, but the clinical signs are more severe in young chickens [2] . In hens, respiratory distress and a decrease in egg production have been reported [3] . Some strains of IBV can cause acute nephritis and urolithiasis associated with a high mortality of infected chickens [4, 5] . In addition, IBV has also been reported to cause proventriculitis [6] . Furthermore, the disease is a risk factor for secondary bacterial infections resulting in an even higher morbidity and mortality rate [5] .",

The genome of IBV consists of positive sense single stranded RNA, approximately 27.6 kilobases in length [7] , that is encoded for four structural proteins: nucleocapsid (N) protein, envelope (E) protein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, and spike (S) glycoprotein [8] . The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into the S1 and S2 subunits [9] . The S1 subunit, located on the outside of virion, is responsible for the fusion between the virus envelope and the cell membrane of the host [7] . It contains virus neutralization and serotype-specific epitopes that are formed by amino acid within the defined hypervariable region (HVR); therefore, the molecular characterization of IBV is based on an analysis of the S1 gene [10] .",

After that, we continued to collect the IBV samples until October 2009. Furthermore, the complete S1 gene sequences were determined in order to obtain more information about the evolution of Thai IBV. Herein, we found that fifteen Thai IBV isolates between 2008 and 2009 were divided into three distinct genotypic groups. When compared with our previous report [17] , the group I Thai IBV was clustered into a different group but still unique to Thailand, the group II was clustered in the group of QX-like IBV and the group III reported only in this study, was clustered into the Massachusetts type. The result suggested that at least three groups of IBV are circulating at the present time in Thailand. Although the basic amino acid residues of the cleavage recognition site of IBV did not correlate with cleavability, Fig. 2 Similarity plot of the S1 gene of the group I Thai IBV (represented by THA90151). Isolate THA80151 (filled triangle) and isolate THA001 (filled square) were used as putative parental strains when isolate THA90151 was queried. M41 (no fill) was used as an outlier sequence host cell range and virulence as orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses, these sequences correlated with the geographic distribution of IBV [23] . Two spike glycoprotein cleavage recognition sites were found in the Thai IBV isolates. The cleavage recognition site sequence, Arg-Arg-His-Arg-Arg, was found in the groups I and II Thai IBV. This cleavage recognition site sequence had been previously reported in Chinese IBV isolates [24] . Another cleavage recognition site sequence, Arg-Arg-Phe-Arg-Arg, was found in the group III Thai IBV. This cleavage recognition site sequence has been found in many countries [23, 24] . Based on these facts, the groups I and II Thai IBV isolates have a close relationship with Chinese IBV isolates.",

Interestingly, when the potential of recombination event was analyzed, the 5 0 -terminus of the S1 gene were similar to isolate THA001 which was isolated in Thailand in 1998 [18] but the remaining sequences were similar to the group II Thai IBV. Surprisingly, when the S1 genes of the group II Thai IBV were analyzed, recombination event was also observed in the nucleotide sequences near the cleavage recognition site. Although the group II Thai IBV appeared to be similar to QXIBV, a region near the cleavage recognition site was found to be similar to JX/99/01 isolated China in 1999 [24] . Our primary concern was that the possible viral recombination resulting from the co-infection of heterologous field strains in the chicken flocks. The recombination may be subsequently occurring with co-infection with QXIBV and JX/99/01 resulting for the occurrence of the group II Thai IBV. After that, the co-infection and exchange of genetic information between the group II Thai IBV and isolate THA001 resulted in the occurrence of the group I Thai IBV. As reported by Wang et al. [25] , the evidence of natural recombination could occur within the S1 gene of IBV field isolates. The natural recombination events observed here indicated that the S1 gene of IBV was the potential site for recombination and that the exchange of genetic information could occur in more than one region of the gene.",

Although the complete S1 gene of the group II Thai IBV was of 95.5-96.0% nucleotide identity to Chinese QXIBV, the nucleotide sequences at 3 0 -terminus near the cleavage recognition site were different from the Chinese QXIBV. We found that this region was closely related to the Chinese isolate JX/99/01. Interestingly, this change was not found when the comparisons of the S1 gene among QXIBV reported in others countries were analyzed (data not shown). These findings suggest that the group II Thai IBV had gone through evident evolution change in Thailand. The isolates in the group III were clustered into the Massachusetts type. The Massachusetts type was also isolated in many countries world-wide including Asian countries such as China, Japan, and South Korea [24] . Some of the Massachusetts type isolated here may be a field challenge which comes from the point mutation of vaccine strains because they had 97.5-99.9% nucleotide and 93.2-99.7% amino acid identity to the vaccine strains (data not shown). It has been shown that the S1 gene of the 4/91 pathogenic virus differs only 0.6% from the vaccine strain but it cannot conclude that the small number of sequence differences are responsible for the attenuation of pathogenicity [32] . However, the possibility that some of them were re-isolation of vaccine strains could not be excluded due to the 100% identity with the Massachusetts type, the vaccine strain used in Thailand. As indicated in the previous report, we could not conclusively distinguish between the vaccine strain and field challenge of the same genotype, especially when a sequence identity of between 99 and 100% was found [33] .",
