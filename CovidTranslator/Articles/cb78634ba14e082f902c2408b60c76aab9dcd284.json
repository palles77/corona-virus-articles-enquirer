Seventeen of 20 vaccinated cats (85%) survived a rigorous virulent FIP V challenge that caused FIP in 12 of 12 non-vaccinated cats (100%), 10 (83%) of which died. Intranasal vaccination stimulated serum IgG and serum and salivary IgA antibody responses (measured by ELISA), FIPV-neutralizing antibody (VN), and a cell-mediated immune (CMI) response as measured by lymphocyte proliferation. The serum antibody response to vaccination was not associated with protection. In fact, the IgG, IgA and VN titres were much higher in control cats than in vaccinated cats following challenge suggesting an immune-mediated pathogenesis. In contrast, stimulation of a mucosal IgA response to vaccination was related to protection. The in vitro proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes in response to virulent FIPV was observed in vaccinated cats, in vaccinated and challenged cats but not in non-vaccinated challenged cats.",

The FIPV, expressed on the surface of infected cells, including macrophages, stimulates T-helper lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes to produce virus-specific antibody. Circulating antibody enhances the infection of macrophages which may increase their synthesis and release of complement. Anti-FIPV antibody:FIPV immune complexes could activate the complement cascade causing release of anaphylatoxin resulting in cytolysis. The dying macrophages may release more virus which in turn could infect more macrophages or be phagocytized as immune complexes. Previous attempts at protective immunization against FIP have not been successful. Indeed, immunization often led to more severe disease symptoms 5-8. We show in this report that intransal (i.n.) administration of a temperature sensitive (ts)-FIPV vaccine, with its ability to grow at the temperatures present in the nasopharynx and its inability to grow at the temperature present parenterally 9, protects cats against FIPV infection and subsequent FIPV-induced immune-mediated pathology.",

In contrast, there was an increase in specific IgA in the saliva of the 15 vaccinated cats that survived challenge. The specific IgA level in the saliva increased in both protected and non-protected vaccinated cats and in control cats following challenge. The increase was greater in vaccinated cats indicating an IgA memory response. Unlike serum IgA and IgG levels of protected vaccinated cats, which declined following challenge, the level of IgA in the saliva of vaccinated cats remained high following challenge. The lgA level in the saliva of vaccinated cats increased further after a second virulent wt-FIPV challenge (data not shown). All but one of the vaccinated cats that survived the first challenge survived a second challenge that killed five of six naive control cats. The serum IgA, IgG and VN responses of vaccinated and control cats were similar to the responses of cats in the previous immunogenicity tests (data not shown).",

Stimulation of a nasal mucosal immune response is best done by i.n. administration of a vaccine. Mucosal B-lymphocytes, stimulated by i.n. vaccination to secrete anti-FIPV IgA antibody, will migrate to the gut mucosa and also confer local gut immunity 12'1a. The ts-FIPV, because it is given i.n., and because of its ability to grow at temperatures present in the nasopharyngeal region 9, stimulated a local immune response as indicated by IgA antibody in saliva. In addition, the ts-FIPV vaccine stimulated a CMI response to FIPV following two vaccinations. The CMI response was still detectable 137 days postvaccination and was amplified following challenge. A CMI response to FIPV did not occur in non-vaccinated cats infected with virulent FIPV. Humoral immunity is reported to enhance rather than protect against experimental FIPV infection 14. Our studies suggest that a humoral response to FIPV, per se, is not detrimental. The ts-FIPV vaccinated cats developed IgG, IgA and virus neutralizing antibody titres without the cats being sensitized to FIPV. However, it should be noted that the geometric mean VN titre of vaccinated cats was less than 10% of the geometric mean titre of the non-vaccinated control cats following challenge. A high level of VN antibody to peplomer epitopes may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Indeed, Vennema et al. s reported that an immune response to peplomer epitopes may be related to disease. They found that cats vaccinated with a recombinant peplomer vaccine developed FIP and died sooner than non-vaccinated control cats.",

In a second challenge of immunity study, all 15 of the 20 vaccinated cats (75%) that survived challenge developed an IgA response to wt-FIPV following vaccination. In contrast, the postvaccination level of IgA in the saliva of non-protected vaccinated cats was no different from the mean IgA level in the saliva of ten control cats, eight of which died (80%). The specific IgA level in the saliva of the protected vaccinated cats increased postchallenge. The level of IgA in the saliva of three of the five non-protected vaccinated cats also increased following challenge. However, the increase in the level of local IgA may have either developed too late to prevent infection or may have been too low before challenge to inhibit the spread of virulent FIPV. It is also possible that these cats did not develop a CMI response to FIPV which, in conjunction with a mucosal immune response, is necessary for protection against FIP.",

The present study showed that two i.n. vaccinations with the ts-FIPV vaccine stimulated a lymphocyte proliferation response to FIPV that was still detectable 137 days postvaccination. A peripheral blood lymphocyte response to wt-FIPV following challenge correlated with the ability of the cat to survive FIPV infection. The lymphocyte proliferation response of vaccinated cats had increased by an average of tenfold by 14 days postchallenge indicating that vaccination had stimulated an immune memory cell response. Although none of the three control cats that died developed a proliferative response to wt-FIPV postchallenge, one of the two control cats that recovered after exhibiting signs of FIP showed a weak lymphocyte proliferative response at 14 days postchallenge. Since the lymphocyte proliferation assay only measures the ability oflymphocytes to respond to FIPV and not the nature of the response, more studies of the cell-mediated response to FIPV need to be done.",

This mixture was layered over a discontinuous Percoll gradient (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and centrifuged at 800g for 20 min to yield a lymphocyte-rich band of cells. The band was removed, washed with S-MEM and resuspended in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO) without serum. Lymphocyte proliferative activity was measured in response to infectious wt-FIPV. The wt-FIPV or virus-free cell culture supernatant, used at a final dilution of 1:20, was added to microtitre plate wells. Then PBL, at a concentration of 2 x l0 s cells per well, and heat inactivated autologous cat serum, collected prior to vaccination, were added.
