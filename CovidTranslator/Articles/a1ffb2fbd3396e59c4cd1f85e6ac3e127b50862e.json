Although entry and exit screening and quarantine measures were successful in delaying entry of the 1918 pandemic virus to some island countries, border screening for SARS was not found to be costeffective. 1 During the pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) 2009, some countries implemented entry screening, although it is unclear how effective it was in delaying entry of the virus 2 ; for example, only 15 of 116 travel-associated cases in Singapore were detected at the airport. 3 The results of modeling studies of the effect of border management to prevent the entry of influenza indicate that a very high proportion of infected travelers (> 99%) would need to be prevented from entering the community to have an important impact on the epidemic in a country, 4---6 and even then entry screening is unlikely to be effective in preventing importation. 7, 8 However, all modeling studies must make assumptions about some variables in the models: for example, the proportion of airline travelers who are infected with influenza, symptomatically and asymptomatically.",

A simple, cheap, quick, and highly accurate test for influenza that could be used on all travelers is not currently available. 10 Therefore, signs and symptoms of influenza must be used to screen travelers to identify those most likely to be infected, for further testing. Influenza screening using symptom questionnaires has inherent limitations to its sensitivity and, hence, effectiveness. Travelers who do not identify themselves as symptomatic will not be detected. These will include those who choose not to disclose symptoms or who use medication to suppress them, and those with no or very mild symptoms on arrival in a country. The latter group includes some who will never develop noticeable symptoms 11 and those incubating infection acquired before or during the flight. 12, 13 Conversely, symptom screening will identify a number of travelers with symptoms not caused by influenza; this could overwhelm testing and quarantine or isolation resources.",

However, people with severe symptoms would be unlikely to commence travel, so if a pandemic strain caused mainly severe disease then the prevalence of pandemic influenza among travelers could be very low. Travel restrictions and advisories during a pandemic may also reduce the prevalence among arriving travelers. In addition, if quarantine or isolation are likely, some travelers will not admit to symptoms or contact with symptomatic others, which would reduce the sensitivity of a questionnaire for influenza infection.

Although sensitivity and PPV can be traded off to some extent, in this study the use of any screening criterion with reasonable sensitivity (e.g., > 80%) would mean that more than 15% of travelers would require further testing. Until highsensitivity rapid tests are available, these travelers would all require isolation pending influenza test results, although fewer than 10% of those thus isolated are likely to be infected. In addition, some arriving passengers who are infected with influenza will not be detected at the border. This includes those whose infection was not detectable on arrival and those missed by screening-the latter alone would be 0.2% of travelers in this study (using criteria with 80% sensitivity, 20% of the 1.13% infected would not be detected).
