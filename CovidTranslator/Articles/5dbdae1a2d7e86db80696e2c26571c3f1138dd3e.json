Sequencing revealed that wild-type PEDVs ORF3 genes had a single ORF of 675 nucleotides encoding a protein of 224 amino acids with a predicted M r of 25.1-25.3 kDa. Attenuated-type PEDVs ORF3 genes had a single ORF of 624 nucleotides encoding a protein of 207 amino acids with a predicted M r of 23.4 kDa. The coding region of the ORF3 gene of attenuated-type PEDVs including attenuated DR13, KPED-9, and P-5V had 51 nucleotide deletions that were not found in the ORF3 genes of wild-type PEDVs including CV777, Br1/87, LZC, parent DR13, and 12 field samples. In addition, attenuated-type PEDVs have previously been found to exhibit reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Therefore, 51 nucleotide deletions appear to be meaningful and may be significant for PEDV pathogenicity, because they lead to changes in the predicted amino acid sequences of attenuated-type PEDVs. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on the partial ORF3 gene including 51 nucleotide deletions revealed that all PEDVs fell into two types, wild-and attenuated-type PEDVs. Wild-type PEDVs containing parent DR13 and 12 field samples had RT-PCR products of 245 bp in size, while attenuated-type PEDVs containing PEDV vaccine strains (attenuated DR13, KPED-9, P-5V) had products of 194 bp. In addition, all PEDV vaccine strains were used as live virus vaccine, because they previously exhibited a reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Therefore, large deletion region, which is comprise 17 amino acid deletions caused by 51 nucleotide deletions and is seen in all PED live vaccine strains, may be important site for PEDV pathogenicity, and we can use it for differentiation of wild-and attenuated-type PEDVs.",

Similarly, many coronaviruses have insertions or deletions in the ORF3 gene.

Especially, wild-type and cell culture adapted PEDVs almost have complete sequence identity with the exception of variations and truncations in the ORF3 gene observed, exclusively, in the cell culture adapted PEDV [16] [17] [18] [19] . Similarly, the highly adapted PEDV, attenuated DR13, was differentiated from wild-type PEDVs by both reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), which used sequence variations in the ORF3 gene of the highly adapted PEDV [20] . Moreover, the ORF3 gene has been suggested as an important determinant for PEDV biological properties.",

But, an ORF of 624 nucleotides, with the potential to encode the coronavirus ORF3 protein, was first identified. All PEDV ORF3 genes including wild-and attenuated-type PEDVs had a sequence (CTAGAC) of 46 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG, as previously recognized in Br1/87 [29] . This sequence is a hexameric motif common to coronaviruses and is similar to the hexameric motifs XUA(A/G)AC found adjacent to other PEDV ORFs.

Parent DR13 was highly homologous to wild-type PEDVs rather than to attenuated-type PEDVs including attenuated DR13, even though it is the origin of the attenuated DR13. In addition, these homology differences, which were caused by deletions and were shown in wild-and attenuated-type PEDVs, could well imply that the ORF3 product is not required for replication of PEDV in cell culture [19, 21] . Moreover, wild-type PEDVs including CV777, Br1/87, LZC, parent DR13 and 12 field samples had high pathogenicity and maximum possible length of the ORF3 genes, the only form which could be detected in wild-type PEDVs.

In addition, all PEDV vaccine strains were used as live virus vaccine because they previously exhibited reduced pathogenicity in pigs. Moreover, this RT-PCR require less labor, less money, and less analysis time compared with the previously established method, which differentiates the highly adapted PEDV from wild-type PEDVs by sequential use of both RT-PCR and RFLP [20] .

We first found an ORF3 of 624 nucleotides having 51 nucleotide deletions compared to wild-type PEDVs and this deletion region might be important site of PEDV pathogenicity. In addition, RT-PCR using that deletion region is very useful to differentiate wild-and attenuatedtype PEDVs. Moreover, the complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the ORF3 gene of the parent DR13, attenuated DR13, KPED-9, P-5V and 12 field samples will now form the basis for further functional exploration of both wild-and attenuated-type PEDVs.
