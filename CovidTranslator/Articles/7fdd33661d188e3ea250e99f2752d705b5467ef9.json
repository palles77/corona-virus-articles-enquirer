S protein comprises of two sub-units S1 and S2 which are responsible for the binding of the host cell receptor and fusion of the cellular membrane, respectively [1, 2, 3] . S protein also contains furin cleavage site at the boundary between the S1-S2 sub-units which mediates the membrane fusion and virus infectivity [1, 2] . It has been suggested that different domains within a single S protein could bind multiple alternative receptors. Although ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor [2, 4] , CD209L, a C-type lectin that binds to high-mannose glycans on glycoproteins, has also been found to be as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV [5] . However, recent studies have mainly focused on the S protein-ACE2 interaction, there is a paucity of information on the SARS-CoV-2 S1",

It has been found that CD209L lectin binds to SARS-CoV, human coronavirus 229E, Ebola, Hepatitis C, HIV, Influenza virus glycoproteins and may mediate the endocytosis of pathogens [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Thus, identification of the carbohydrate-lectin interaction sites on the 3D structure for understanding of the initial binding of virus to a host cell is crucial. Besides, as post-translational modifications regulate the host-pathogen interaction [12] , identifying SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein modifications may help us to inhibit initial binding of the virus. 3D crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with Nglycosylation positions was identified but, sites such as furin cleavage and O-glycosylation are missing. In addition, the detailed structure of N-glycan units was not included in this model [13] . As glycan structures typically exist in solution or on proteins, it is a big challenge to characterize the 3D structure of glycoproteins experimentally. However, computational structural biology allows us to generate 3D protein and glycoprotein modelling with high accuracy rate using all amino acid sequence [14] [15] [16] . Herein, we predicted O-glycosylation and phosphorylation positions using full amino acid sequence of S1 protein. Candidate positions were further analyzed with enzyme binding activity, solvent accessibility, surface area parameters and the positions determined with high accuracy rate were used to design full 3D glycoprotein structure of the S1 protein using carbohydrate force field.

Therefore, researchers primarily have focused on the S protein structure of SARS-CoV-2 virus and revealed the 3D structure with N-glycosylation positions. But, the detailed structure of the N-glycan units in these sites and the O-glycosylation positions are not included in the current model [13] . Also, it is known that the initial binding of other coronaviruses to host cell occurs via the alternative receptor C-type lectin CD209L besides ACE2 protein [5] . Taken together, herein, we first demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein high mannose N-glycan structure and its interaction with CD209L.

There has been a structural study on C-type lectin-glycan interaction but terminal sugar is not \u03b1 -mannose here [18] . Thus, in this study, the interaction between the C-type lectin and \u03b1 -D-mannose was analysed and interface residues were identified. ZDOCK docking and PDBePISA interface interaction analysis showed in two models with high accuracy rate that mannose sugar interacts with C-type lectin at Met282, Lys307, and Ser345 positions with hydrogen bonding (Fig. 2) . We suggest these positions as the \u03b1 -D-mannose recognizing sites having function on the lectin-sugar binding.",

Besides, we found additional O-glycosylation positions at Thr323, Thr632, and Thr638 on the S1 protein. On the 3D glycoprotein structure, Thr323 was found to be located at RBD and Thr678 and Ser686 located near Furin Recognizing Site (FRS) ( Fig. 1 and 3). Since O-glycans are involved in protein-protein interactions [19], we suggest that Oglycans at Thr323 may play a role on binding to ACE2 and O-glycans at Thr678, Thr686 may responsible for furin protease enzyme binding. It has been known that O-glycans are responsible for the protein stability and creating mucin like domain as glycan shields involved in immunoevasion [21] . Based on this, we suggest that the O-glycosylation positions found may be involved in the stability of the S1 protein and immunoevasion of virus to the host cell.",

In this study, phosphorylation modification of SARS-CoV-2 S1 protein was also examined and 36 positions of Ser/Thr residues were found to be phosphorylated on almost all domains of the protein ( Table 2) . Davidson et al. have shown that S1 protein is phosphorylated at 7 positions [23]. Amongst them, Ser459, Ser637, Ser640 positions were found to be correlated with our results. Phosphorylation modification regulates the protein activity and function in cooperation with glycosylation [24, 25] . When we examined the phosphorylation and glycosylation locations of S1 protein on the 3D structure; the phosphorylation positions at Ser161 and Ser162 were found to be located close to glycosylation position Asn165. Likewise, Thr109 with Asn234; Ser680 with Thr678 and FRS; Thr604 with Asn603; Thr630 with Thr632; Thr637 and Thr640 with Thr638; Ser659 with Asn657 were found to be located close to each other on the 3D structure ( Fig. 3) .

Therefore, we focused on the CD209L lectin-\u03b1-D-mannose interaction of S1 protein and suggested Met282, Lys307, and Ser345 positions as targets for the initial binding.
