Many countries such as the USA, Australia and France have already included the use of face masks in their pandemic plans. 2, 3 Influenza is primarily spread through person-to-person contact via large droplets produced by breathing, talking, coughing or sneezing. As a result, a face mask works by providing a physical barrier against the potentially infectious droplets. Recent studies have concluded that the use of face masks reduces the reproduction number of the virus, which could help delay or possibly contain an influenza pandemic. 4 In 2010, Aiello et al. found that there was a 10e50% reduction in the spread of ILI due to the use of face masks and hand hygiene. 5 These conclusions were all drawn from the fact that the face masks were worn correctly. WHO states that wearing a mask incorrectly may actually increase, rather than decrease, the rate of transmission. 6 The correct use of face masks is particularly important in Hong Kong as the use of face masks is prevalent. Studies have found that 88.8% of participants wore face masks when they had ILI, and 21.5% reported wearing face masks regularly in public. 7 A study by Lau et al. found that the Hong Kong public were likely to adopt self-protective behaviors such as using face masks in public places. 8 Lau et al. concluded that in the event of a future respiratory illness outbreak, the Hong Kong public would be likely to adopt self-protective behaviors which may help to contain the spread of the virus in the community. 9 Several studies in Hong Kong and elsewhere have investigated the prevalence of facemask use. 8e10 However, no studies have investigated the correct use of face masks either in Hong Kong or internationally.",

The Hong Kong outpatient setting was chosen as the study population because previous case studies have indicated that healthcare settings are a major source of ILI infection. 9 Hospital waiting areas are prime areas for the transmission of airborne infections, because many people are gathered in a confined area, some of whom may have medical conditions that make them vulnerable to infection. Relative to the general population, those who are in an outpatient clinic may experience higher levels of exposure to ILI and, therefore, it is important for both outpatients and their caregivers to wear face masks in order to prevent transmission and for selfprotection. The results of this study will help in tailoring a more efficient programme to combat ILI transmission in primary care outpatient settings. This study aimed to assess if a knowledge gap exists in the use of face masks for both subjects seeking medical consultation and their caregivers in an outpatient setting in Hong Kong, and to explore correlations between knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding the use of face masks.",

As no data on the prevalence of correct use of face masks could be found, the assumed prevalence was set at the recommended level of 50%. As a result, a total of 383 subjects were required. For inclusion in the survey, respondents had to be either an outpatient or a caregiver of an outpatient at the clinic. A systematic sampling approach was adopted to recruit outpatients and caregivers at the clinic by excluding every fourth outpatient/caregiver. As a result, 75% of the study subjects were invited to participate in the questionnaire survey.",

Knowledge items were adapted from guidelines recommended by the Centre for Health Protection 10 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 11 Attitudes were rated on a five-point Likert scale and based on the Health Belief Model.

            "text": "Face masks have been recommended as a public health nonpharmaceutical intervention against ILI. However, in order for face masks to provide effective protection, the public must possess the correct knowledge for wearing them. In this study, 88.4% of respondents believed that they knew the correct steps for wearing a face mask; however, only 52.0% answered the procedural question correctly. These findings may be due to the fact that face masks have a relatively simple design, which leads many people to assume that they know the correct procedure for use. The low proportion of correct answers may reflect the lack of standard requirements for the packaging of face masks and their designs. In Hong Kong, there are no guidelines for facemask manufacturers to follow. The packaging of many face masks do not include clear instructions. This problem is compounded by the fact that designs for face masks differ between manufacturers. Some face masks have a colored side to indicate which side should face out. However, face masks that are white on both sides also exist. Without proper instructions and knowledge, it is difficult to wear a face mask correctly. In other knowledge items, respondents typically scored high. However, only 53.6% correctly answered 'False' to the statement 'When wearing a face mask in the clinic, there is no need to cover your mouth when sneezing or coughing.' This indicates that respondents did not know that face masks can only act as a barrier for large droplets and not for very small particle aerosols. This misconception could possibly lead to an increase in ILI transmission, as viruses can still be transmitted through the facemask cover. These findings indicate an urgent need for a better public health programme to increase knowledge about the correct wearing of face masks. Attitudes toward the use of face masks were generally positive. Respondents rated nurses and doctors as being good sources for cues to action (85.0% and 81.6%, respectively). On the other hand, only 52.2% indicated that posters would serve as an effective reminder for wearing a face mask. This may be due to the fact that there are numerous posters in the waiting area for various health reminders. In fact, four posters related to the proper use of face masks were found within the clinic area. However, these posters mainly consisted of written instructions, which may be a problem for those who have difficulty reading. In addition, these posters were hidden amongst many other educational materials, which makes it difficult for them to be an effective cue to action.",

This may have resulted in a nonresponse bias. Steps were taken to minimize this bias by giving subjects the option of having an interviewer read the questions to them. In addition, the use of closed-ended questions may not have covered the whole range of answers. To overcome this limitation, a pilot survey and informal interviews were conducted prior to the start of the study. This was done to ensure that the survey was appropriate and covered the important items in relation to the use of face masks. Another limitation was that this study was only conducted in one clinic. Therefore, these results may not be generalized to all outpatient clinic populations. However, this study provides valuable insights for further investigation of the knowledge gap in the correct use of face masks. Future studies should include both private and public clinics, and explore factors related to the knowledge gap. By doing this, public health programmes can be better tailored to increase the level of knowledge about the use of face masks.",

The results of this study indicate a knowledge gap that should be addressed by public health education. It is recommended that public health education campaigns should tailor efficient programmes to combat ILI transmission among outpatient clinic populations by improving knowledge about the correct use of face masks. Guidelines for facemask manufacturers should be created and enforced so that proper instructions are printed clearly on the packaging. Medical personnel also play an important role in increasing the use of face masks in the clinic setting. Future studies are needed to investigate whether this knowledge gap exists in other outpatient clinics in Hong Kong.",
