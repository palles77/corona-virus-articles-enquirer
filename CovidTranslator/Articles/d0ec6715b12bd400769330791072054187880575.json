Six of 12 mice examined 13 days post infection (p.i.) showed meningo-encephalomyelitis with focal spongiform lesions in the grey and white matter. The spongiform lesions were characterised by necrosis of putative oligodendrocytes, myelinic vacuolation and mononuclear cell infiltration. Only one of six mice examined 21 days p.i. and one of six mice examined 28 days p.i. showed lesions which comprised reactive and dystrophic changes in the white matter. Spongiform lesions and pycnotic nuclei were not seen at these times. Viral nucleocapsids were seen in the early stages of the disease in putative necrotic oligodendrocytes. Mature virus particles were not seen. This was in contrast to mice infected with virulent wild-type SFV when lesions were more severe and were accompanied by large numbers of immature and mature virus particles. It is suggested that the demyelination in mice infected with mutant SFV results primarily fi'om selective destruction of oligodendrocytes by the mutant virus.",

The virulent wild-type (wt) strain causes a fatal encephalitis in young mammals. The avirulent A774 strain results in lesions similar to those caused by the wt strain but, in contrast, this infection is usually subclinical and the lesions subsequently regress (Chew-Lira et al. 1977a) .",

            "text": "Demyelination is a feature of infection with the avirulent strain of SFV virus. The pathogenetic mechanism of myelin destruction is poorly understood and some of the evidence which has been presented is contradictory. Chew-Lira et al. (1977b) showed that the efficient production of antibody is protective against demyelination in single dose infections with A774-SFV. Mice receiving 500 tad total body irradiation prior to infection showed multiple foci of demyelination, a delayed antibody response and yielded the highest titre of virus. Similar results were obtained when the same strain of virus was used in athymic nude mice (Chew-Lim 1979) . These authors concluded that demyelination in A 774-SFV infection probably results from direct viral activity rather than from an immunological reaction. Ultrastructural studies of mice infected with A774-SFV showed no changes in oligo-dendr0cytes (Chew-Lira et al. 1978; Suckling et al. 1978) . It seemed unlikely, therefore, that direct viral damage to the oligodendrocyte was a cause of the demyelinative plaque. In contrast to the foregoing Jagelman et al. (1978) found no evidence of demyelination in athymic nude mice infected with A 774-SFV while focal areas of demyelination were seen in up to 26 ~ of similarly infected heterozygous and conventional Swiss A2G mice. It was suggested from this study that an immunological response related to the presence of thymus-derived lymphocytes was involved in the development of demyelination in immundcompetent animals_ Suckling et al. (1978) found that the incidence of myelin loss varied from 8-21% when some strains 0001-6322/81/0053/0129/$1.60 Acta Neuropathol (Bed) 53 (1981) of mice, other that Swiss A2G, were infected with A 774-SFV. These findings indicated that the genetic constitution of the mice also influenced the pathogenesis of the disease.",

Of three such isolated mutants only one (M 136) was able to enter and multiply in the brain following i.p. infection with 102 p.f.u. This dose was lethal for the wt strain. Most mice infected with the mutant M 136 survived although a proportion showed demyelination at 13 days after infection when no infectious virus was present (Barrett et al. 1980) .

Firstly, virus particles were seen only in the early stages of M 136 infection in contrast with the wt lesions where viruses were always present in large numbers. These findings correlated with the virus isolation studies which showed that the M 136 mutant entered the brain only transiently, being cleared by day 4 p.i., as opposed to the wt virus which persisted in the brain until death (Barrett et al. 1980) . Secondly, spongiform lesions developed more slowly and were more focal in the M 136 lesions. Thirdly, neuronal necrosis was widespread in the wt infection as opposed to the M 136 infection where necrotic change remained confined to cells which closely resembled oligodendrocytes. The interfascicular and perineuronal distribution of these cells and the continuity with adjacent myelin sheaths constituted additional evidence for the oligodendrocyte nature of these cells. Necrosis of oligodendrocytes and putative oligodendrocytes also has been described in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (Lampert 1967) ; JHM murine corona virus encephalomyelitis in mice (Lampert et al, 1973) and rats (Nagashima et al. 1978) ; and cuprizone intoxication in mice (Blakemore 1972) . The occurrence of paracrystalline arrays of virus particles in the ne&otic cells 5 days p.i. in the present study suggested that the necrosis resulted from infection with the M 136 mutant.",

Mechanisms of demyelination in viral infections can be divided into those where the cytotoxic effect of the virus is directly responsible for destruction of the myelinating cell and those where the demyelination is immu-nologically mediated (Wisniewski 1977) . Examples of the cytotoxic type of demyelination include acute murine encephalomyelitis caused by the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Lampert et al. 1973) . Theilers virus, another cause of encephalomyelitis in mice, has been proposed as a model system for the study of immunologically mediated demyelination (Dal Canto and Lipton 1977) , Demyelination occurs as a late manifestation of this disease, it is accompanied by an inflammatory cell infiltrate and can be prevented by immunosuppressive treatment. Recent studies with the WW strain of Theilers virus in newborn mice have shown lysis of oligodendrocytes during acute infection (Penney and Wolinsky 1979) . The possibility was considered that oligodendroglial antigens released during this phase could constitute a stimulus for the subsequent autoimmune demyelination. The putative necrotic oligodendrocytes in mice infected with M 136-SFV were accompanied by occasional mononuclear inflammatory cells on day 5 p.i. Inflammatory cells were more numerous on day 13 p,i. when the necrotic cells were also accompanied by myelin breakdown. Stripping of myelin lamellae by invading mononuclear cell processes (Wisniewski 1977) was not seen, however, Fig, 11 . An area of medulla oblongata at 13 days p.i. Intramyelinic vacuolation and a compressed myelin sheath. \u2022 9,100 and the lesions apparently resolved quickly without any evidence of a secondary wave of demyelination. These findings suggest that the mechanism of demyelination in mice infected with M 136-SFV is primarily that of a eytolytic effect on oligodendrocytes with myelin breakdown secondary to oligodendrocyte destruction. Further studies are required before the significance of any immunopathological mechanism in this infection can be assessed.",
