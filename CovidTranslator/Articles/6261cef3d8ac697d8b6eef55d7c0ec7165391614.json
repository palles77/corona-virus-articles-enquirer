            "text": "Alemtuzumab was used as an induction agent in 205 renal transplant recipients undergoing 207 living donor renal transplants. All donor kidneys were recovered laparoscopically. Postoperatively, patients were treated with tacrolimus monotherapy, and immunosuppression was weaned when possible. Forty-seven recipients of living donor renal transplants prior to the induction era who received conventional triple drug immunosuppression without antibody induction served as historic controls. The mean follow-up was 493 days in the alemtuzumab group and 2101 days in the historic control group. Actuarial 1-year patient and graft survival were 98.6% and 98.1% in the alemtuzumab group, compared to 93.6% and 91.5% in the control group, respectively. The incidence of acute cellular rejection (ACR) at 1 year was 6.8% in the alemtuzumab group and 17.0% (p < 0.05) in the historic control group. Most (81.3%) episodes of ACR in the alemtuzumab group were Banff 1 (a or b) and were sensitive to steroid pulses for the treatment of rejection. There was no cytomegalovirus disease or infection. The incidence of delayed graft function was 0%, and the incidence of posttransplant insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was 0.5%. This study represents the largest series to date of live donor renal transplant recipients undergoing alemtuzumab induction, and confirms the short-term safety and efficacy of this approach.",

B cells, natural killer cells, and monocytes are also depleted by alemtuzumab to a lesser extent. While the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially approved it for the treatment of chronic B-cell lymphocytic leukemia in 2001 (3, 4) , the ability of alemtuzumab to deplete lymphocytes from the circulation has generated interest in the use of this antibody in solid organ transplantation. While alemtuzumab has not been approved by the FDA for use in organ transplantation, the experiences with this monoclonal antibody in renal transplantation have been promising (2, (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) .",

We have previously observed that the use of preconditioning permits spaced weaning of immunosuppression (8) (9) (10) 21) . The use of alemtuzumab, compared with thymoglobulin has been associated with a substantially lower incidence of acute cellular rejection (ACR), but both have been associated with a low incidence of infectious complications and other adverse events (8) (9) (10) 21) .

Forty-six living donor kidney recipients with previous extra-renal solid organ transplants (n = 43) or positive pretransplant crossmatches (n = 3) were excluded. Prospective data were collected on both donors and recipients. The immunosuppressive regimen was based upon pretreatment with intravenous 30 mg Campath-1H (alemtuzumab, Berlex, Seattle, WA, USA). Pre-medication was with 1 g of methylprednisolone, which was repeated prior to reperfusion to avoid intra-operative hypotension from cytokine release syndrome. Posttransplantation low-dose tacrolimus monotherapy (target trough of 10 ng/mL) for the first 100 days posttransplantation was given, starting on postoperative day 1. At approximately 100 days posttransplantation, the twice-daily dose of tacrolimus was consolidated to once a day in recipients with no clinical evidence of ACR (i.e. increase in creatinine confirmed by biopsy). Protocol biopsies were not performed. If the patient continued to do well, the dose was weaned to once every other day after another 1 to 4 months. Further weaning was continued to three times a week, twice a week or once a week at 2 to 6 months intervals if the patient continued to do well in the absence of a rising creatinine or clinical ACR. Episodes of biopsy-proven ACR were treated with a 1 g of intravenous methylprednisolone or 30 mg intravenous Campath-1H, for steroid-resistant ACR.",

Another patient died from sepsis with a functioning allograft after suffering an esophageal perforation during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD); immunosuppression was discontinued during sepsis. The 3rd and 4th deaths were from a myocardial infarction 24 months posttransplantation, and from a nonsmall cell lung cancer 32 months posttransplantation, respectively.

Of the 87 recipients who were weaned to spaced-dose monotherapy, 45 (22.0%) recipients were on every other day (qod), 35 (17.1%) recipients were on three times per week (3\u00d7/week), 4 (2.0%) recipients were on twice per week (2\u00d7/week), and 3 (1.5%) recipients were on once per week (1\u00d7/week) tacrolimus. A total of six recipients had HLA identical donors and their frequencies of tacrolimus dosing are as follows (see Table 4 ): bid (n = 2), qod (n = 2), 2\u00d7/ week (n = 1), 1 \u00d7/week (n = 1). Of the 167 alemtuzumab induction recipients who have \u2265 6 months follow-up, the majority of recipients (n = 87, 52.1%) are on spaced-dose monotherapy. We anticipate the number of recipients on spaced-dose monotherapy will continue to increase over time.",

A 5-year follow-up study compared outcomes in 33 renal transplant recipients who received alemtuzumab induction therapy followed by low-dose cyclosporine monotherapy to 66 renal transplant contemporaneous control recipients who received conventional immunosuppression consisting of cyclosporine, azathioprine and prednisolone (6) .

Knechtle and colleagues from the University of Wisconsin utilized alemtuzumab induction therapy followed by sirolimus monotherapy in a pilot study involving 29 renal transplant recipients at 3 to 29 months of follow-up (11) . In this study, there were no infectious complications and no evidence of malignancy. However, 8 (27.6%) of the 29 patients experienced rejection, and while the rejection was treated successfully in 7 patients, 1 patient experienced graft loss. Of the eight patients that experienced rejection, five had evidence that received alemtuzumab experienced a significantly of humoral rejection. More recently, Knechtle and colleagues reported on the results of 126 renal allograft recipients who received alemtuzumab induction therapy compared with other recipients who received either anti-CD25 antibody, thymoglobulin, or other induction therapy with a CNI, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisone for maintenance (12) . The group that received alemtuzumab experienced a significantly lower incidence of ACR compared to the other groups, while the rates of infection and malignancy were not significantly different. Importantly, patients with DGF experienced less rejection with alemtuzumab than the control groups and had improved graft survival. Kaufman and colleagues (13) reported similar results with kidney transplant patients receiving alemtuzumab (n = 123) or basiliximab (n = 155) induction with a prednisone-free maintenance protocol using tacrolimus (6 to 8 ng/mL) and mycophenolate mofetil combination. A lower rate of early (<3 months) ACR was observed in the alemtuzumab (4.1%) versus the basiliximab (11.6%) group, but the actual ACR rates for both groups in living donor recipients were equivalent at 1 year (alemtuzumab = 14.3%, basiliximab = 12.4%).

All recipients developed reversible ACR within the first month that was characterized by predominantly monocytic infiltrates. These episodes were responsive to treatment with steroids or sirolimus or both. In a more recent pilot study of five recipients of live donor kidneys treated with perioperative alemtuzumab and deoxyspergualin (which has an inhibitory effect on monocytes and macrophages) without maintenance immunosuppression, Kirk et al. reported that all five recipients developed reversible ACR that was similar in timing, histology, and transcriptional profile to that seen in patients treated with alemtuzumab alone (15) . T-cell depletion combined with deoxyspergualin induces tolerance in nonhuman primates but does not appear to induce tolerance in humans. It appears that chemokine production is not adequately suppressed with alemtuzumab induction and that some form of maintenance immunosuppression is required with this protocol. (7), in a pilot study of 22 kidney transplant recipients receiving alemtuzumab induction, sirolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil maintenance without CNI and steroids, demonstrated a relatively high incidence of ACR (36% at 1 year) and possible pulmonary toxicity, raising concerns about the efficacy and safety of the protocol. This and other studies point to the importance of at least an initial period of CNI in recipients receiving alemtuzumab induction. We did not see a higher incidence of pulmonary toxicity with the vast majority of our recipients extubated posttransplantation not requiring an intensive care unit.",

Accordingly, recent reports have described monocyte-predominant ACR (14) as well as severe, early acute humoral rejection (24) . We did not see a higher incidence of early severe acute humoral rejection in our patients with tacrolimus monotherapy. The importance of CNI requirement in the early posttransplant period with alemtuzumab induction was demonstrated in the pilot studies by Flechner and Knechtle et al. (7, 11, 12) . The majority of ACR episodes in this current study was Banff 1a or 1b, and was successfully treated with a steroid bolus.",

            "text": "The findings in this report have several limitations. While this study confirms the short-term safety and efficacy of alemtuzumab, long-term follow-up is clearly needed. A mean followup of 493 \u00b1 282 days in 205 recipients is relatively short. The acute drop in the tail end of the Kaplan-Meier patient and graft survival curves may be related to the small number of patients at long-term follow-up. However, it may also represent a serious long-term concern. More careful assessment of graft function with creatinine clearance at various time points may provide a more accurate measurement of renal function. Continued follow-up will clearly be required to assess long-term graft survival and function. The delayed incidence of ACR that occurs as lymphocytes return to baseline will need to be monitored closely, as will the rates of late chronic allograft nephropathy. Re-population of the profound depletion of peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes, and NK cells by alemtuzumab can take up to 1 year. Knechtle and colleagues (2) found lymphocytes reach at least 80% of baseline values 18 to 24 months post-alemtuzumab induction. It is also hoped that with a lower starting dose of tacrolimus progressively weaned over time, a decreased incidence of CNI nephrotoxicity will be observed compared to traditional triple immunosuppression.",

The immunologic mechanisms that permit the ability to wean immunosuppression in these patients have yet to be elucidated. Additional studies directed at elucidating these mechanisms are currently under way (25) . It is hoped that monitoring of class I and II antibodies by enzyme-linked immunoassay and identification of DSAs can potentially aid in weaning of immunosuppression and thus decrease the incidence of postweaning ACR. We are also in the process of assessing both the frequency and function of donor-reactive T cells, as well as identifying cytokine gene polymorphism and assaying alloantibody titers in recipients who have or have not experienced rejection after spaceddose weaning. The advisability of empiric immunosuppression withdrawal in otherwise stable patients remains to be established. Given the increased, albeit low, rate of acute rejection seen post-weaning in previously stable patients, this approach remains investigational. Wean time = days to wean tacrolimus monotherapy from a consolidated daily dosing to less than that (e.g. qd to qod/3\u00d7/week).
