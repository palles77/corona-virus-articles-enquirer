The Ash-linked core oligosaccharides undergo a modification in a post-ER compartment that increases the mass of Kexlp by 1-2 kD, demonstrating that Kexlp does not receive an extensive outer chain (Cooper and Bussey, 1989) . Such a modification was reduced in a secl mutant which blocks intra-Golgi transport, and was unaffected in a secl mutant that prevents secretory vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (Novick et al., 1981; Cooper and Bussey, 1989) .",

An analysis of mutant forms of Kexlp was undertaken to examine which domain(s) of Kexlp was responsible for its retention. The hydrophobic domain near the carboxy terminus of Kexlp was previously shown to be responsible for conferring membrane association, as deletion of this 17-amino acid residue region resulted in a soluble protein, Kexlp-AMS (Cooper and Bussey, 1989) . Cells expressing this protein showed a significant increase in Kexlp-dependent activity in the cell medium (see below). That Kexlp-AMS was secreted rather than retained suggests that one of several domains may be responsible for retention of Kexlp: (1) the membranespanning domain which was absent in Kexlp-AMS, (2) the carboxy-terminal domain which was no longer exposed in the cytoplasm in Kexlp-AMS, and (3) a domain amino- S86-16/pKXl-18Hpa was radiolabeled for a 10-min pulse (P) and harvested or chased for an additional 90 min (C).

All of the truncated proteins were smaller than Kexlp by the predicted amount and entered the secretory pathway as shown by the addition of Ash-linked glycosylation (data not shown). A concern was that the mutants designed to remain membrane associated may not attain a stable type I orientation and remain in the ER. The most severely truncated mutant in this class, Kexlp-Hpa, lacks the entire endogenous cytoplasmic domain; it was further analyzed and shown to receive Asn-linked glycosylation which was further modified within the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 4) . Previous sodium carbonate extractions of whole cell extracts demonstrated that Kexlp fractionated with the membrane containing pellet fraction whereas the soluble protein, Kexlp-AMS, fractionated with the supernatant (Cooper and Bussey, 1989) . Carbonate treatment of whole cell extracts showed that Kexlp-Hpa fractionated with the membrane pellet (Fig. 4 , lanes 5 and 6), consistent with it being an integral membrane protein.

The above results indicated that Kexlp-Hpa was membrane associated, had received glycosyl modifications in the Golgi apparatus, gave wild-type levels of total activity, and was retained intracellularly; yet processed the K1 killer toxin precursor to a lesser extent than Kexlp. Kexlp-Bcl and Kexlp-Hinc showed similar phenotypes to that of Kexlp-Hpa.

            "text": "An analysis of the oligosaccharide modification of Kexlp in-dicated secretory compartments to which the protein had been exposed, and the likely subcellular location of Kexlp. The modification of the Asn-linkod oligosaccharide cores of Kexlp occurred within the Golgi apparatus and likely involves several sequential steps. Initially, in a pre-sec7 compartment, the core oligosaccharides are partially modified as judged by an increase in apparent molecular mass (Cooper and Bussey, 1989) . Subsequently, in a post-sec7 compartment, the core is further modified in a MNNl-dependent manner. Invertase produced in sec7 cells at the restrictive temperature does not receive c~(1--'3) linked mannose residues to the core or outer chain (Franzusoff and Schekman, 1989) , most likely because of the failure of secretory proteins to reach the compartment containing the cx(1--,3) mannosyltransferase. It is consistent that sec7 and mnnl mutations result in a similar reduction in the glycosyl elaboration of Kexlp, as they would respectively either prevent Kexlp from reaching, or reduce the activity of, the c~(1~3) mannosyltransferase. The Golgi-based modification of Kexlp can thus be explained as a result of two processes. The first occurs before the sec7 block and most likely involves the addition of an ot(l~6) mannose residue followed by the attachment of an oz(1--'2) linked mannose residue (indicated by * in Fig. 1 ). The second step involves the MNN1dependent addition of up to three a ( l ' 3 ) linked mannose residues (indicated by a circle in Fig. 1) to the oligosaccharide (Ballou et al., 1990) . Graham and Emr (1991) provided evidence for at least three functional compartments in the yeast Golgi apparatus that contain, from cis to trans, the following activities: (1) ct(l~6) mannosyltransferase, (2) cx(l~3) mannosyltransferase, and (3) Kex2p endoprotease. Kexlp must reach the Golgi compartment housing the MNNl-dependent o~(1---3) mannosyltransferase as it is modified by this enzyme. In addition, to process killer toxin, Kexlp must reach the proposed third Golgi compartment containing Kex2p as the toxin precursor substrate for Kexlp is created by a Kex2p-mediated endoproteolytic cleavage. No post-Kex2p compartment before secretory vesicles has been observed (Graham and Emr, 1991) and, therefore, it is likely that Kexlp resides with Kex2p in the same late Golgi compartment (Redding et al., 1991) . It is interesting to note that both Kexlp and Kex2p Figure 9 . Model for the retention of Kexlp within the secretory pathway. A model for the retention of Kexlp is presented. Kexlp is retained in a late Golgi compartment because of its cytoplasmically exposed domain interacting with a receptor (Recpt). Kexlp-AS, being soluble, is secreted by default to the cell surface. Kexlp-Hpa is membrane associated and residues in the vacuole because of several possible reasons: (1) Kexlp-Hpa is partially misfolded and is targeted to the vacuole via an unknown system; (2) the membranespanning domain of Kexlp contains a cryptic targeting signal for the vacuole; (3) Kexlp-Hpa is secreted to the plasma membrane where it is endocytosed and delivered to the vacuole; and (4) membrane-associated proteins that leave the Golgi apparatus are targeted to the vacuole by default. Kexlp is delivered to the vacuole when overproduced to a high level, presumably due to saturation of a Golgi retention receptor. The horizontal bar protruding from the Kexlp-WT box represents the membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domain, while for Kexlp-Hpa the bar represents the membrane-sparming domain. (Wilcox and Fuller, 1991) undergo a slow addition ofa(l~3) mannose units to their respective glycosyl groups.",

            "text": "Different mechanisms have been proposed for the retention of proteins within Golgi compartments. Interactions involving the cytoplasmic domain of Kexlp may result in the aggregation of the protein in the appropriate compartment, and thereby prevent it from entering transport vesicles that are exiting the Golgi compartment (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . This retention via aggregation model is unlikely as it does not explain why aggregation would not occur earlier in the secretory pathway or why overproduction of a Kexlp results in mislocalization to the vacuole rather than greater aggregation in the Golgi compartment. A more likely explanation for the retention involves a receptor interacting with the cytoplasmically exposed domain of Kexlp ( Fig. 9 ). High level expression of Kexlp would saturate the receptor with the result that excess Kexlp is diverted to the vacuole. Removal of the cytoplasmic domain would abolish such a receptor-ligand interaction, also resulting in mislocalization to the vacuole. Retention of soluble ER proteins has been shown to involve a receptor-mediated retrieval of proteins from a pre-cis- Golgi compartment (Semenz~ et al., 1990; Lewis et al., 1990) . A cytoplasmicaUy based retrieval system analogous to the ER system can be envisaged in which Kexlp is retrieved from a trans compartment, possibly the plasma membrane, and returned to the correct Golgi compartment. To determine if Kexlp is retrieved from the plasma membrane an immunofluorescence experiment was performed by inducing expression of Kexlp in a secl strain, secl is a conditional mutation that, at the nonpermissive temperature, prevents the fusion of secretory vesicles with the plasma membrane (Novick et al., 1981) . The delivery of Kexlp to its Golgi location was not blocked by secl, and if KEX/expres-The Jouma! of Cell Biology, Volume 119, 1992 sion was constitutive before imposition of the secl block, the staining pattern of Kexlp was not altered even after 3 h at the restrictive temperature (data not shown). Therefore, if a receptor retrieval system exists, it is unlikely that Kexlp is retrieved from the plasma membrane as outlined in one of several proposals presented by Payne and Schekman (1989) . If a retrieval system is responsible for the retention of Kexlp, then the salvage compartment may instead be located between the Golgi compartment and the vacuole where failure to bind the receptor would result in delivery to the vacuole.",

(1) The first model suggests that membrane-associated truncated forms of Kexlp are misfolded, and as such may be targeted, via an unknown mechanism, to the vacuole for degradation. This model seems unlikely as all of the truncated forms of Kexlp, both soluble and membrane associated, have similar total pro-tease activity to that of the wild-type protein, suggesting that at a minimum the catalytic domain of the mutants has folded to a conformation similar to that of wild type. In addition, these forms of Kexlp all exit the ER and reach the Golgi apparatus where they are both glycosylated and process killer toxin. The misfolding targeting model would be unusual in that it must explain the mislocalization of the membraneassociated mutant forms of Kexlp yet allow the soluble forms to be secreted. Also, such a garbage pathway for delivery of misfolded mutant forms of Kexlp cannot explain the vacuolar localization of highly expressed but presumably correctly folded Kexlp. (2) The second model proposes that the membrane-spanning domain of Kexlp contains a latent or cryptic targeting signal for the vacuole. Studies are currently under way to address this possibility. It should be noted that although Kexlp is homologous to the vacuolar protein CPY, the homology does not extend to include the vacuolar targeting signal found in proCPY. (3) The third model involves Kexlp-Hpa (-Bcl, -Hinc) being secreted to the plasma membrane by default, where it is then endocytosed and delivered to the vacuole. Such a \"transient appearance\" of Kexlp-Hpa (-Bcl, -Hint) at the cell surface would not be detected by the activity assay used or by indirect immunofluorescence. Soluble Kexlp-AS, having reached the cell surface, would be released into the medium and, hence, would not be endocytosed to the vacuole. (4) The final model proposes that the vacuole is the direct default destination for membraneassociated proteins that enter the secretory pathway, such that membrane proteins lacking positive targeting/retention signals would be delivered to the vacuole.",

The basis of the post-ER progressive carbohydrate modification of Kexlp was analyzed using strains with mutations at various mnn loci. Such mutant strains show defects in outer chain glycosyl elaboration resulting in various truncations of the outer chain(Ballou, 1982; Kukuruzinska et al., 1987;  Fig. 1). Several mnn strains were radiolabeled and the degree of modification of immunoprecipitated Kexlp was examined. Kexlp produced in mnn9 ceils received most, if not all, of the wild-type glycosyl modification(Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6)suggesting that most of the carbohydrate addition to Kexlp was not in the elaboration of the outer chain as mnn9 blocks initiation of outer chain synthesis",
