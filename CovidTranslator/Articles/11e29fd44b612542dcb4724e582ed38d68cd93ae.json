The religious sites are visited by millions of pilgrims throughout the year, and a mass gathering occurs during Hajj (5) . Although there are strict requirements for vaccination to avoid disease outbreaks during Hajj, the sheer number of visitors contributes to increased infectious disease burden (5) . Moreover, illegal migration to KSA for work or Hajj adds to this burden because most illegal immigrants do not have the required vaccinations. In recent years and with improvements in infrastructure and health services, an emerging burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is unfolding; studies found high rates of obesity, diabetes, and high blood pressure (6-10). Moreover, with increased use of motor vehicles, the burden of road traffic injuries increased (11) .",

Each risk factor or risk factor cluster was analyzed separately, such that the sum of attributable fractions for a disease or injury may be greater than 100%. Uncertainty in the relative risks, exposure estimates, theoretical minimum risk distributions, and in the background outcome rates were considered in the final estimates. IHME in collaboration with the KSA MOH developed a database of published and unpublished data sources to estimate the burden of disease for KSA. Key sources for this database included data from systematic reviews of the literature, household surveys, antenatal clinic surveillance, reportable disease notifications, disease registries, hospital admissions, outpatient visits, populationbased cancer registries, screening results, and other administrative sources. These data sources were used to estimate the disease and disability burden for 1990, 2005, and 2010.",

The rise of RTAs and NCDs are a clear warning of the need for immediate intervention. The major challenge ahead for KSA is reducing the burden of chronic diseases and their risk factors. As the country's population ages and grows, NCDs will pose a major challenge to KSA even with its wealth and resources. Our findings on the huge burden of NCDs in KSA are similar to those we observed in the GBD 2010 results for other Gulf countries. NCDs are becoming a major burden in the region and in the Arab world (19) . The rapid change in the burden profile in the region is alarming. Diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, cancers, and cardiovascular diseases are putting a huge toll on the health care systems and on society. This transition needs a planned intervention to control and prevent the future burden of disease. Most governments in the region have not given attention to NCDs as they have given or are giving to infectious disease. A new culture of health care in KSA and the region should be a priority.",

The MOH in collaboration with the Ministry of Interior launched a road safety program called Saher in 2009 (31). Saher is an automated system that was developed to manage traffic via electronic systems in major cities in Saudi Arabia (31). This newly established system uses a digital camera network connected to the National Information Center to track any violations and to control traffic (31). However, data on its long-term effects on accidents and deaths are not yet available. Other efforts to reduce RTAs should focus on police enforcement of traffic laws. RTAs would be much lower if the police were to ensure that drivers have a license and that all vehicle occupants are wearing seat belts. Societal mores play an important role in health promotion. Individual well-being is directly related to the strength of the social relationships and support that a person receives (32). The problems that the Saudi health system is facing require multi-sectorial interventions with roles and responsibilities for many players. Perhaps an important role should be played by the religious community. Religious institutions can be a source of social support by stressing values that influence health-related behavior (33).
