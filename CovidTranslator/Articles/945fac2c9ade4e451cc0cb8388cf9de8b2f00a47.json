Moderate outcomes included receipt of a new antibiotic prescription (n = 144; 59%), bronchodilator/nebulizer (n = 45; 19%), or systemic corticosteroids (n = 28; 12%). The relative risk of a serious outcome was significantly increased in persons aged \u226575 years (vs 60-64 years) and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or congestive heart failure. The average seasonal incidence was 139 cases/10 000, and it was significantly higher in persons with cardiopulmonary disease compared with others (rate ratio, 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.44-2.48).",

Both influenza and RSV account for a substantial number of respiratory illness deaths among adults \u226565 years of age in the United States. From 1997 to 2009, influenza and RSV contributed to approximately 28 000 and 17 000 annual cardiorespiratory deaths, respectively [1] . RSV is also an important cause of adult respiratory illness in both developed and developing countries, including tropical and subtropical regions [2] [3] [4] . Studies conducted in the 1980s and 1990s first identified RSV as a cause of acute respiratory illness in a variety of adult populations, including older adults, working-age adults, hospitalized patients, and residents of long-term care facilities [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Immunocompromised adults and those with advanced age and/or cardiopulmonary disease are at especially high risk for severe complications from RSV infection [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

Before each influenza season, a community cohort was defined based on residency in or near Marshfield, Wisconsin, and receipt of care from the Marshfield Clinic. Individuals in the community cohort were eligible to be recruited when seeking care for acute respiratory illness in outpatient clinics (all seasons) or in the hospital setting (2004-2005 through 2009-2010) . Each season, recruitment began when influenza activity was detected in the community and usually continued for 12-15 weeks. Symptom eligibility criteria varied by season but included fever/feverishness or cough during most seasons. For the 2011-2012 through 2015-2016 seasons, eligibility was based on the presence of acute respiratory illness with cough. The maximum duration of illness was 10 days for the 2004-2005 through 2006-2007 seasons and 7 days for all subsequent seasons. After obtaining informed consent, a midturbinate swab was obtained for influenza detection. Symptoms and onset date were assessed during the enrollment interview. Realtime reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed each season to identify influenza cases. After testing was complete, aliquots of samples in viral transport media were frozen at -80\u00b0C.",

Seasonal incidence is reported as episodes of medically attended RSV illness per 10 000 population. A detailed description of the incidence estimation procedure was published previously [27] . Briefly, all estimates were standardized to a 31-week period from approximately early October through early May using Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene surveillance data. Incidence calculations were based on 2 assumptions: (1) test results from enrolled patients can be extrapolated to nonenrolled cohort members with a respiratory illness visit during the enrollment period; and (2) the number of RSV cases occurring outside the enrollment period in the cohort was proportional to the number of statewide cases occurring outside the enrollment period. Poisson regression with analytic weights, offsets, and robust variance estimation was used to estimate seasonal incidence with corresponding 95% confidence intervals and test for linear trends in seasonal incidence.

In this study, we found that RSV-msLRTD at the time of enrollment was significantly associated with a serious clinical outcome. In particular, patients with RSV-msLRTD at enrollment were significantly more likely to require hospital admission and were also more likely to develop pneumonia during the follow-up period. The incremental risk (absolute risk difference) for each of these outcomes exceeded 20% when RSV-msLRTD was present at enrollment.
