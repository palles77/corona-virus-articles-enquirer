            "text": "The spike glycoprotein of mouse hepatitis virus strain A59 mediates the early events leading to infection of cells, including fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The spike is a type I membrane glycoprotein that possesses a conserved transmembrane anchor and an unusual cysteine-rich (cys) domain that bridges the putative junction of the anchor and the cytoplasmic tail. In this study, we examined the role of these carboxyl-terminal domains in spike-mediated membrane fusion. We show that the cytoplasmic tail is not required for fusion but has the capacity to enhance membrane fusion activity. Chimeric spike protein mutants containing substitutions of the entire transmembrane anchor and cys domain with the herpes simplex virus type 1 glycoprotein D (gD-1) anchor demonstrated that fusion activity requires the presence of the A59 membrane-spanning domain and the portion of the cys domain that lies upstream of the cytoplasmic tail. The cys domain is a required element since its deletion from the wild-type spike protein abrogates fusion activity. However, addition of the cys domain to fusion-defective chimeric proteins was unable to restore fusion activity. Thus, the cys domain is necessary but is not sufficient to complement the gD-1 anchor and allow for membrane fusion. Site-specific mutations of conserved cysteine residues in the cys domain markedly reduce membrane fusion, which further supports the conclusion that this region is crucial for spike function. The results indicate that the carboxyl-terminus of the spike transmembrane anchor contains at least two distinct domains, both of which are necessary for full membrane fusion.",

Like all coronaviruses, MHV strain A59 possesses a large (31 kb) single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (Lee et al., 1991; Pachuk et al., 1989) that is associated with the viral nucleocapsid protein (Sturman et al., 1980) inside a host cell-derived membrane. The envelope contains four to five additional structural proteins depending on the particular strain of virus. Prominent among these is the spike glycoprotein, which is a 180-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein that functions in receptor binding and membrane fusion . It is translated as a 145-kDa polypeptide and glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum. For A59 and some other stains of MHV, the spike is posttranslationally cleaved into two 90-kDa subunits (Luytjes et al., 1987; Sturman et al., 1985) termed S1 (N-terminal) and S2 (C-terminal), presumably in the trans",

Furthermore, virus infectivity does not require cleavage of the A59 spike protein (Bos et al., 1997) and thus differs from other RNA viruses such as paramyxoviruses, influenzavirus, and retroviruses (Glickman et al., 1998; Kawaoka and Webster, 1988; Perez and Hunter, 1987) . Expression of the spike on the surface of the infected cell results in extensive cell-cell fusion. It is clear that fusion is mediated solely by the spike since expression of the glycoprotein in the absence of other viral proteins is sufficient to induce cell fusion (Stauber et al., 1993; Taguchi et al., 1992; Vennema et al., 1990) .",

Nine of the cysteine residues are found in a stretch of 18 amino acids that overlaps the junction of the membrane-spanning domain and the cytoplasmic tail, and 4 of these 9 residues are conserved among most coronaviruses (Fig.  1 ). This cysteine-rich (cys) domain is of unknown function, but the unusual sequence composition and conservation of the cys domain suggest that it is important in the biology of the spike.

Coronavirus spike proteins are unusual in at least two aspects. First, they contain a cys domain approximately 20 amino acids in length and containing 40 to 50% cysteine. The cys domain bridges the putative border between the hydrophobic membranespanning domain and the cytoplasmic tail ( Fig. 1 ). In addition, four of the cysteines present in the A59 cys domain are highly conserved, suggesting that these amino acids contribute to spike function. Second, the transmembrane anchor is one of the most highly conserved regions of the protein.

This colorimetric fusion assay was used to examine the fusion activity of spike proteins with mutations in the transmembrane anchor and the cytoplasmic tail. Extensive identity in amino acid sequence in these domains is apparent upon comparison of the protein sequences of a number of different coronaviruses (Fig. 1) , which led us to hypothesize that the carboxyl-terminus of the spike protein was important in the function of the protein. To test this hypothesis initially, we used a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based mutagenesis procedure (Chen and Przybyla, 1994; Li and Wilkinson, 1997) to construct three C-terminal truncation mutants that removed increasing amounts of the cytoplasmic tail (Fig. 3A) . We found that removing up to 17 amino acids (\u232c17) from the C-terminus had no detrimental effect on cell-cell fusion (Fig. 3B ). In fact, removal of either 8 or 17 amino acids increased the spike fusion activity 50 and 100%, respectively. However, when the complete cytoplasmic tail was removed (\u232c25), cell-cell fusion was decreased approximately 40% relative to that of the wild-type spike. These data argue that the cytoplasmic tail has the capacity to modulate spike fusion activity but is not absolutely required for activity.",

Since deletion of the cytoplasmic tail from the spike did not prevent fusion activity while the substitution of the transmembrane anchor in chimeric protein KC22 was fusion-defective, we concluded that the transmembrane domain contains one or more regions that are critical for fusion. The obvious candidate is the cys domain that overlaps the junction between the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain and the cytoplasmic tail. To ascertain whether a requirement for the cys domain was responsible for the fusion phenotypes of the A59:HSV chimeras, we produced a spike protein that was entirely A59 in origin except that the first 11 amino acids of the cys domain (all amino acids lying upstream of the cytoplasmic tail) were removed. This construct, KC25, retains the hydrophobic portion of the membrane-spanning domain adjoined to the A59 cytoplasmic tail, including the last 7 amino acids of the cys domain (Fig. 5A) . We also constructed an additional chimera based on the fusiondefective chimera KC22, in which the missing 11 amino acids of the cys domain were inserted between the end of the gD-1 transmembrane anchor and the A59 cytoplasmic tail, thus restoring the entire cys domain (Fig.   FIG. 4 .

The rationale for analysis of this mutant was that if the fusion phenotype of KC22 was due to loss of the cys domain rather than to substitution of the transmembrane anchor, the replacement of the cys domain should restore fusion activity to the chimera.",

Removal of the majority of the cys domain from the wild-type spike reduces fusion activity over 99%, as shown by the lack of detectable activity by KC25. However, the restoration of the cys domain in KC22cys failed to even partially restore fusion activity. Together, these results clearly show that the cys domain is necessary for the wild-type spike to function properly in membrane fusion, but is not sufficient to restore activity to fusion-defective A59:HSV chimeras. We conclude that fusion requires the cys domain and all or part of the transmembrane domain. In this regard, Bos et al. (1995) demonstrated that the spike protein of A59 loses syncytial activity if the entire cys domain and cytoplasmic tail are replaced by the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein cytoplasmic tail.

We found that mutation of any single cysteine residue diminished the level of fusion, but in only a few instances was fusion reduced to nearly undetectable levels. Cysteine 1287 (C1287) was the most sensitive to hydrophobic substitution and less affected by neutral or hydrophilic changes. Substitution of C1287 to a tryptophan nearly inhibited cell fusion, though the level of activity was still greater than that of the negative control (Student's t test, P \u03fd 0.05). In contrast, C1292 and C1296 were least sensitive to the neutral or hydrophobic substitution of tyrosine or tryptophan, respectively. Mutation of either residue to a more hydrophilic serine reduced fusion over 90%. Finally, mutation of C1304 reduced the level of fusion by a comparable amount with all three substitutions.

Membrane fusion is a two-step process that initially involves the formation of a hemifusion intermediate, which is characterized by the mixing of lipids between the outer leaflets of the opposing membranes. To ascertain whether the fusion-defective mutants were capable of promoting lipid mixing, DBT cells were infected with vTF7.3 and subsequently transfected with spike cDNAs, labeled with 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA), and then incubated with normal DBT cells that had been labeled previously with the lipophilic dye octadecyl rhodamine B (R18). Hemifusion induced by fusion-defective spike molecules should result in the transfer of rhodamine to the fluorescein-positive, spike-expressing cells and result in doubly fluorescent cells. Cells transfected with the wild-type spike gene caused cell-cell fusion and readily induced the transfer of R18 to the CMFDA-labeled, spike-expressing cells as would be expected during cell-cell fusion. More importantly, both CMFDA and R18 can be observed in individual cells that have not yet fused to form heterokaryons (Figs. 7A and 7B, arrow) as well as in syncytia (Figs. 7A and 7B, asterisk). Expression of the cys-deletion mutant KC25 in DBT cells failed to induce visible cell-cell fusion, consistent with data presented in Fig. 5 . However, the expression of KC25 did promote lipid mixing (Figs. 7C and 7D), indicating that loss of the full-length cys domain prevents a step of membrane fusion occurring after formation of the hemifusion intermediate. Lipid mixing was not observed in control cells that were infected with vTF7.3 and subsequently transfected with the expression plasmid lacking a spike coding sequence (Figs. 7E and 7F) .

The fusion peptide promotes a state of hemifusion, which is characterized by the merger of the outer (but not inner) leaflets of the opposing membrane bilayers. Formation of a fusion pore between two cells (or virus and cell) occurs when the two inner leaflets of the membranes fuse.

Initial experiments focused on the cytoplasmic tail and showed that partial truncation of the cytoplasmic tail increased fusion activity up to twofold. However, deletion of the entire cytoplasmic domain reduced fusion activity approximately 40%. Immunofluorescence staining of cells expressing the various spike truncation mutants showed that all were expressed on the cell surface. The changes in fusion activity may be due to modulation of the inherent fusion activity of the spike or, alternatively, simply to alterations in the level of the spike protein present on the surface of transfected cells. In this latter regard, it is interesting to note that an interaction between lentivirus envelope glycoproteins and clathrin-associated adaptor complexes AP-1 and AP-2 was shown to markedly affect the subcellular dis-tribution and cell surface expression of the viral glycoproteins (Berlioz-Torrent et al., 1999) . The cellular adaptor proteins recognize and bind a tyrosine-based sorting signal present in the cytoplasmic tail of the viral glycoproteins. Such an interaction could potentially regulate the level of the MHV spike protein on the cell surface. Although the observed changes in fusion activity for the three truncation mutants are statistically significant compared to wild-type (Student's t test, P \u03fd 0.05), it remains to be determined whether a twofold reduction or enhancement in fusion activity is biologically significant and affects the infection of cells or spread of virus.",

After transfection, the cells were stained with the green fluorescent dye CMFDA. A fivefold excess of normal DBT cells previously labeled with R18 was added to the CMFDA cells and examined by fluorescence microscopy for transfer of the red fluorescent R18 to CMFDA-labeled cells. A, C, and E show fluorescence due to fluorescein (CMFDA), and B, D, and F show fluorescence due to the rhodamine (R18). Cells transfected with wild-type spike formed syncytia as indicated by the asterisk. The arrows in A, B, C, and D point to cells that are dually labeled. The arrowheads in E and F point to cells from the control sample that are stained with fluorescein but not R18. all or part of the cytoplasmic tail enhances membrane fusion, as demonstrated for simian immunodeficiency virus (Ritter et al., 1993) , HIV (Dubay et al., 1992; Wilk et al., 1992) , Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (Brody et al., 1994) , and murine leukemia virus (Januszeski et al., 1997; Ragheb and Anderson, 1994a; Compans, 1996, 1997) . In the last case, deletion of the C-terminal 16 amino acids of the env glycoprotein removes the R peptide, which is responsible for the inhibition of fusogenic activity (Ragheb and Anderson, 1994a; Rein et al., 1994; Yang and Compans, 1996) . In contrast, the F protein of SV5 and parainfluenza type 3 (PIV3; Yao and Compans, 1995) and possibly the G protein of VSV (Odell et al., 1997) appear to require the cytoplasmic domain for efficient membrane fusion. In at least one case, this requirement is strain specific. Truncation of the PIV3 F protein cytoplasmic tail markedly reduces fusion while truncation of the parainfluenza virus type 2 F protein does not (Yao and Compans, 1995) . The role of the cytoplasmic tail in fusion is not clear, but studies of the influenza hemagglutinin have shown that mutations in the cytoplasmic tail can affect fusion pore \"flickering\" without affecting the subsequent enlargement of the fusion pore (Melikyan et al., 1997b) .",

As noted below, we believe that this is due partly to the disruption of the cys domain. The loss of fusion in the gD-1 transmembrane substitution mutants was unexpected since the gD-1 transmembrane anchor supports fusion when cloned into the VSV G protein (Odell et al., 1997) . Similar results for the influenza hemagglutinin further support the idea that the specific sequence of the transmembrane anchor is not critical for function (Schroth-Diez et al., 1998) .",

However, in the case of the A59 spike protein, it would appear that full fusion (i.e., fusion pore formation) is dependent on the sequence of all or part of the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain. Two possibilities are being considered. First, the amino-terminal one-half of the A59 transmembrane anchor is highly conserved among coronaviruses (Fig. 1) , suggesting that this part of the anchor is functionally important. For example, if this region of the anchor is involved in membrane destabilization during fusion, the spike may be unable to resolve the hemifusion intermediate in its absence. The second possibility is that the body of the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain harbors a \"glycine hinge\" similar to that described for the VSV G protein (Cleverley and Lenard, 1998) . The presence of the VSV glycine hinge was shown to markedly enhance the efficiency of membrane fusion by the G protein. The hinge is postulated to destabilize the hemifusion intermediate and thus aid in the formation of the fusion pore.",

(1995) that showed a loss of fusion activity when the cytoplasmic tail, including the cytoplasmic portion of the cys domain, was replaced with the VSV G protein cytoplasmic tail. We speculated that the inability of the gD-1 transmembrane anchor chimeras to induce fusion was due to loss of the cys domain. However, restoration of the cys domain to a fusion-defective chimera (i.e., KC22cys) did not restore activity and led to the conclusion that the body of the A59 transmembrane domain contains one or more functional regions necessary for membrane fusion. The importance of the cys domain is further supported by experiments in which each of the four conserved cysteines in the domain was individually mutated. With the exception of C1304, which probably lies in the cytoplasmic tail of the protein, mutation of any one cysteine drastically reduced or abrogated fusion. Most pronounced were mutation of C1292 and C1296, both of which were quite sensitive to hydrophilic substitutions. Similar studies by Bos et al. showed that a spike protein with mutation of cysteine 1295, cysteine 1296, and phenylalanine 1297 also exhibited reduced fusion activity. If the cys domain exists as a helix, C1292 and C1296 would lie on a strongly hydrophobic face of the spike transmembrane anchor, which could explain the marked reduction in fusion when hydrophilic mutations are made at these two positions.",

However, the A59 spike protein lacks this unpaired cysteine residue and yet is able to undergo pH-independent fusion. Due to the location of Cys 1163, it is plausible that this cysteine may be involved in early conformational changes required to bring about hemifusion. However, the location of the four invariant cysteines (C1287, C1292, C1296, and C1304 within the membrane-spanning region and cytoplasmic tail of the S2 subunit, together with the results of lipid-mixing experiments, suggests that these four cysteines are important during the later stages of fusion.",

The spike protein is palmitylated on the carboxyl-terminal S2 fragment (Niemann and Klenk, 1981; Schmidt, 1982; Sturman et al., 1985; van Berlo et al., 1987) . Palmitate is generally attached to viral fusion proteins through a thioester bond involving cysteines that reside near the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane (Ponimaskin and Schmidt, 1995; Rose et al., 1984; Schlesinger et al., 1993; Schmidt, 1989; Sefton and Buss, 1987) . All of the cysteine residues in the spike that potentially could be acylated are in the cys domain, suggesting that mutations to this region may be inhibiting fusion by interfering with palmitylation of the spike protein. Since palmitylation is known to affect a variety of processes mediated by or involving fusion proteins, including infection of cells, membrane fusion, and virus assembly (Glick and Rothman, 1987; Jin et al., 1996; Melikyan et al., 1997b; Naim et al., 1992; Schroth-Diez et al., 1998; Zurcher et al., 1994) , studies are in progress to identify the sites of acylation and determine the role that palmitylation may play in spike protein function.",

Mutagenic primers were purchased from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Briefly, PCRs were done using the wild-type spike gene cDNA as template, a mutagenic forward primer, and a universal reverse primer. The product from this reaction was purified and used as a reverse mega-primer in a second PCR that contained the wild-type spike gene cDNA as template and universal forward primer. The final PCR product from this three-primer procedure, comprising the entire transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, was digested with NdeI and BamHI and subcloned into the wild-type A59 spike gene cDNA. In some cases, a four-primer mutagenesis procedure was used. In this technique, separate forward and reverse mega-primers were made using the universal forward primer and a reverse mutagenic primer, and a forward mutagenic primer and a universal reverse primer, respectively. These two megaprimers were mixed and used in a PCR together with the universal forward and reverse primers, and the final PCR product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and subcloned into the wild-type spike cDNA.",
