Numerous parasitic or bacterial agents have been implicated, but a pathogen-specific aetiology has not been found. Enteric viruses (i.e., rotavirus, small round structured viruses, coronavirus, and adenovirus) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or electron microscopy in faecal specimens of 17% of 198 consecutive adult admissions to a general medical ward of an urban hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire. Overall, 57% of patients were seropositive for infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1; of these, 50% were classified as World Health Organization AIDS stage IV. The prevalence of enteric viruses in stool specimens did not differ significantly between patients with and without HIV infection, and was not associated with acute or chronic diarrhoea, or constitutional symptoms. However, a trend (P=O.14) towards greater frequency of virus in stools from patients in the lower 3 quintiles of the CD4iCD8 T cell ratio was seen. This trend approached statistical significance (P=O.O7) with stratification by HIV infection. Although we found no evidence in this population to support a major pathogenic role for these viruses alone in the enteropathy of AIDS, increased viral shedding was weakly associated with irnmunodeficiency.",

Recently, studies in Australia and the United States have identified several groups of enteric viruses present in the stool of homosexual men infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-l) with and without AIDS (CUNNINGHAM et al., 1988; KALJOT et al., 1989) . Although these agents were imphcated as possible causes of acute or relapsing episodes of diarrhoea, they were not associated with the presence of chronic diarrhoea. Specimens from symptomatic HIV-infected African patients, to our knowledge, have not previously been examined for the presence of enteric viruses. We report here the results of a pilot cross-sectional survey of 198 unselected consecutive admissions to a large hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire, to determine the prevalence of enteric viruses and their relation to diarrhoea, wasting and immunosuppression among HIV-infected and unjnfected patients 'In an area where diarrhoeal disease is common and heterosexual HIV transmission predominates.",

Of these, 36 patients were excluded from the analysis because they appeared moribund, died within 24 h of admission, or refused to co-operate. A comprehensive medical history and physical examination were performed on each patient. HIV serological testing and a confirmatory Western blot were performed on sera from all patients. A diaanosis of AIDS was based on HIV-l seroDositivitv and world Health Organization (WHO) cliniial criteria for AIDS in Africa (WHO, 1990; COLEBUNDERS et al., 1987b) . A single stool specimen was obtained within 48 h of admission to hospital from the 198 assessable patients and blood was taken for T cell subset typing. Patients were monitored throughout their hospital stay, and the final diagnosis and disposition were recorded.

            "text": "In this study, we found antigenic and/or EM evidence of enteric viruses in the stool of 17% of adult patients who were recently admitted to the general medical wards of Mama Yemo Hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire. Equal detection rates were seen among patients with and without acute or chronic diarrhoea. While 17% appears to be a relatively high prevalence rate of viral carriage for adults, it is notable that CUNNINGHAM et al. included in this study were both at increased risk of exposure to enteric viruses; homosexual STD clinic attenders because of oral-anal sexual practices and the patients reported here because of crowded living conditions and close proximity to young children who could serve as viral reservoirs. The fact that natients admitted to Mama Yemo Hospital tend to be vGy sick (overall in-hospital mortality rate=41%) and frequently have advanced malnutrition impairing their resistance to infection may also account for the high rate of viral shedding reported here. Although the possibility exists that this high prevalence rate represents some nosocomial transmission, this is unlikely because most stools were obtained on the day of admission and all were obtained within 48 h of admission. Seroepidemiological studies in non-industrialized countries indicate that exposure to rotavirus and the Norwalk family of viruses occurs during early childhood, and that by adulthood over 70% of the population have been exposed (GREENBERG er al., 1979) . Additionally, prospective studies have shown that serological immunity in adults is not universally nrotective and that adults-may become reinfected, albe'lt with mild or no svmntoms ~WENMAN et al.. 1979) . Indeed. in a non-&oipective'studv of rotaviral infection in adult contacts of paediatric patients, 88% were asymptomatic (KIM et al.. 1977) . Thus. the high detection rates of enteric viruses in patients withour diarrhoea reported here may indicate that hyperendemic enteric viral infection existed in this population.",

            "text": "The role of enteric viruses in the pathogenesis of chronic diarrhoea associated with AIDS is unknown. Severe or chronic enteritis due to rotavirus, adenovirus, or coxsackievirus has been reported in bone marrow transplant recipients (SAULSBURY et al., 1980; YOLKEN et al., 1982) , suggesting that T cell comnetence may be important in thehost'sdefence against these agents or in the termination of the diarrhoeal event followine infection. Alternatively, the local mucosal effects of intensive chemotherapy, large doses of radiation used in bone marrow transplantation, or graft-versus-host disease may play a more significant role in disrupting host defence against enteric viruses than alterations in cellular immunity. In this regard, it is notable that, despite finding increased carriage of enteric viruses among homosexual patients with more advanced HIV disease, CUNNINGHAM et al. (1988) could not demonstrate an association with acute or chronic diarrhoea. Although they reported that the rate of viral shedding was increased to 50% in patients with symptomatic -HIV disease compared with a background of 18% in asvmotomatic HIV infected oatientc, they could not show ahifference in the frequency of either acute or chronic diarrhoea. KALJOT et al. (1989) reported a lower prevalence (9%) of enteric viruses in homosexual patients in the United States but also found viral shedding more frequently among homosexual patients with AIDS than among homosexual patients with AIDS-related complex. Like CUNNINGHAM et al. (1988 ), KALJOT et al. (1989 found no correlation between viral shedding and the presence of diarrhoea in any group. In contrast. SMITH et al. (1988) reoorted no evidence of rotavirus infection in 32Xhomosexual AIDS patients in the United States with or without diarrhoea, but did not test for other enteric viruses. Regardless of HIV serostatus or HIV-associated symptoms, we did not find an association between gastrointestinal virus in the stool and the presence of acute or chronic diarrhoea or constitutional symptoms. This could be due to the lack of a healthier non-diarrhoeal control group, the high asymptomatic carriage rate in this population, or the cross-sectional nature of the study. Our results suggest that enteric viruses do not play a pathogenic role in diarrhoea in the populations reported here, although the sample size of our study may have been too small to show an association at the relatively low detection rates found for the individual viral agents. Given the high virus detection rates in nondiarrhoeic patients, further studies to assess a causal association for any of these enteric viruses would require prospective study groups of more than 150 cases and an equal number of controls to.detect a 40% difference in rates of infection between groups with and without diarrhoea .",

Thus, hidden associations between enteric viruses and diarrhoeal symptoms are less likely to be obscured by excluding cases of potential coccidial diarrhoea. For-completeness, data presented in the Tables includes the 35 cases with coccidial infection but analvsis after the removal of these cases did not reveal any hidden association. Because we did not perform routine bacterial stool cultures we cannot exclude any cases of bacterial diarrhoea that may have occurred and, therefore, possibly obscured an association.",

This did not achieve statistical significance but the trend became stronger when stratified by HIV infection status (Table  4 ). In spite of meaningful comparisons between early and advanced HIV disease being limited because of the few patients with mild HIV disease in this study, we believe that comparisons of immunocompetence based on CD4ICD8 ratios allowed us to use HIV-uninfected patients as adequate controls. Despite the high mortality (22%) and debilitated state of these HIV-negative patients. their mean CD4iCD8 ratio was normal (Table 3) . Given this, we were able to demonstrate that a lo& CD4iCD8 ratio was weakly associated with a greater probability of passing enteric virus, regardless of whether diarrhoeal disease was present or not. This was similar to the results of CUNNINGHAM et al. KALJOT et aZ. (1989) , who reported that the presence of enteric virus in the stool of HIV-infected homosexual patients was related to the degree of immunosuppression, determined by advancing clinical HIV stage. Neither symptoms or infection correlated very well with the presence of serum antibodies to enteric viral infections (GREENBERG et al., 1979; KAPIKIAN et al., 1983) and the data presented here suggest that cellular immunity may ulav a role in this interaction. Further studies that ad-&e& the role of secretory immunity as well as local and systemic cellular immunity are needed.",
