            "text": "RNA viruses are the causative agents for AIDS, influenza, SARS, and other serious health threats. Development of rapid and broadly applicable methods for complete viral genome sequencing is highly desirable to fully understand all aspects of these infectious agents as well as for surveillance of viral pandemic threats and emerging pathogens. However, traditional viral detection methods rely on prior sequence or antigen knowledge. In this study, we describe sequenceindependent amplification for samples containing ultra-low amounts of viral RNA coupled with Illumina sequencing and de novo assembly optimized for viral genomes. With 5 million reads, we capture 96 to 100% of the viral protein coding region of HIV, respiratory syncytial and West Nile viral samples from as little as 100 copies of viral RNA. The methods presented here are scalable to large numbers of samples and capable of generating full or near full length viral genomes from clone and clinical samples with low amounts of viral RNA, without prior sequence information and in the presence of substantial host contamination.",

            "text": "Massively parallel sequencing allows for rapid and low-cost deep sequencing of viral genomes and provides an opportunity to gain greater insight into viral evolution, fitness, emergence and transmission. Currently, reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with primers designed to amplify specific viral RNA sequences is the most common method for amplifying RNA viruses prior to sequencing and other downstream applications. Recent studies have used both 454 (1-11) (Newman et al., manuscript submitted) and Illumina (12) (13) (14) sequencing of RT-PCR amplicons for RNA viruses. However, standard RT-PCR methods are not adequate for the generation of templates suitable for sequencing low-copy viral RNA samples, where labor-intensive methods such as nested PCR (15) or single-genome amplification (SGA) (16, 17) are typically required. Examples of low-copy viral RNA samples include the following: HIV controllers (capable of controlling the virus in the absence of antiretroviral therapy) (18) , dengue virus (DENV) clinical samples collected after peak viremia (19) , and West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance samples (20) . Obtaining genomic sequence from such samples can provide valuable insights into viral attenuation, response to host immune pressure and drug treatment during infection, disease severity, transmission and epidemic spread.",

This allows sequencing of viral genomes with little or no genomic information and of highly divergent viruses for which robust primers targeting conserved regions are difficult to design. To date these methods have difficulty with sequencing complete genomes from clinical samples due to high levels of host contamination and low viral amounts. The SISPA method described by Djikeng et al. is capable of capturing complete genomes from viral RNA samples, but requires high viral amounts and removal of host RNA contamination with RNases prior to viral RNA extraction (22) . Work by Victoria et al. demonstrated the ability to capture complete genomes from stool samples, but it appears these samples had high viral titers (25) . Recent work by Ninomiya et al. has demonstrated success of capturing hepatitis C virus (HCV) total RNA sequencing from clinical samples (23) , but this method required 200 ng of input RNA which exceeds the amount typically present in most clinical samples. Moore et al. evaluated the sensitivity of detection of infectious agents using RNA sequencing (24) . Their method worked well for detecting low amounts of virus but was limited to input amounts of 30,000 copies of viral RNA per sample.",

To analyse input data composition, we first employed an efficient Illumina aligner BWA-v0.5.9 (26) by aligning reads to viral and host reference genomes. For HIV clone and clinical samples, the reference genomes used were the concatenation of the human genome assembly (NCBI36/hg18), human rRNA sequences (NR_003286.1, NR_003287.1, V00589.1, NR_003285.2, gij251831106: 648-1601, gij251831106:1671-3229) and the HIV HXB2 sequence (K03455.1). For WNV clone samples, the reference genomes used were the concatenation of preliminary and unpublished sequencing data from the golden hamster, Mesocricetus auratus, (K. Lindblad-Toh, personal communication), hamster rRNA sequences (NR_045212.1, NR_045133.1, NR_045213.1, D89009.1, DQ334843.1) and WNV NY99 reference (NC_009942.1).

The alignment was carried out by first aligning each read independently using command: bwa aln (-q 5 -l 32 -k 2 -t 4 -o 1), then the read pair information was used by invoking command: bwa sampe (-a 100 000). MergeBamAlignments, from the picard package (v1.59) [http://picard.sourceforge.net/], were used to return the unmapped reads to the aligned BAM file. A custom script was used to count the number of reads aligning to each of the concatenated references. Compared with the BWA aligner, the Mosaik aligner (version 1.1.0013) (http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/marthlab /Mosaik) is slower but more accurate when aligning relatively long Illumina reads like the ones used in the current studies. To determine more accurate coverage information for our viral samples only, we used Mosaik (MosaikAligner -st illumina -hs 10 -act 15 -bw 29 -mmp 0.25 -minp 0.25) to align reads to the target viral reference genome and the consensus assembly results. Primer sequences were not trimmed since soft-clipping is tolerated by Mosaik.",

In short, VICUNA used the Ovation RNA-Seq primer sequence (inferred from several input datasets) for read trimming. Low complexity reads were discarded. Since some of the HIV, RSV and WNV datasets contained a large percentage of reads derived from the host, we invoked the optional target genome filter component of VICUNA. Based on sequence similarity, the remaining reads were clustered to form contigs, which were further validated such that each read in the contig had sufficient similarity compared with the consensus. Guided by paired reads, these contigs were compared using an efficient alignment algorithm. Any two contigs that shared a significant suffix-prefix overlap were merged. The assembly process terminated when no further merging could be applied. In several cases, a viral reference genome was used to further extend the assembly. Briefly, raw contigs of >350 bases obtained by the assembler were aligned to a reference using MUSCLE (version 3.8) (38) . Each contig was broken down in segments when there was a deletion of 30 or more nucleotides compared with the reference. The contigs were added to form the final assembly in decreasing order of length until either the whole assembly was covered or no contigs remained. Overlapping segments were merged together by concatenating the nucleotide sequence of each segment at the central position of overlap.",

First, the majority of reads (>95%) contained a partial (>9 bp) Ovation RNA-Seq SPIA (single primer isothermal amplification) primer, which often appears in the start of the read. Second, a substantial fraction (up to 25%) of the reads did not align to the viral or host references. With a fraction of the unaligned reads (50 000), we used MEGAN to identify the composition of unaligned reads for the HIV and WNV clones (Supplementary Figure S3) . For the HIV clone, the read composition was: 12% bacterial, 3% eukaryotic, 4% retrovirus, 33% not assigned and 48% no hit. The retrovirus hits were unaligned HIV sequences. The majority of the not assigned reads were bacterial rRNA and HIV hits that could not be classified to specific taxonomical group. The no hit reads were mostly simple sequence repeats and SPIA primer sequences. The high abundance of these reads might be due to the low input amounts, which led to the greater abundance of these non-specific by-products. For the WNV clone, the read composition was: 0.5% bacterial, 3% eukaryotic, 0.5% flavivirus, 2% not assigned and 95% no hit. The eukaryotic hits were mostly rat and mouse. The flavivirus hits were unaligned WNV sequences. Some of the no hits for WNV clone were simple sequence repeats and SPIA primer, but the majority of the no hit reads for WNV could not be identified as similar to known sequences. It is possible that these reads could be hamster-specific sequences that were not aligned to the preliminary golden hamster assembly.",

As previous reports using this system utilized only the version 1 system (39), we compared the coverage pattern between version 1 and version 2 systems for HIV clone and clinical samples ( Figure 1B) . For both HIV clone and clinical samples, version 2 had more even coverage than version 1 ( Figure  1B ) based on a lower coefficient of variation (CV) (Supplementary Table S3 ).

VICUNA is designed to assemble genetically heterogeneous viral genomes in the presence of large amounts of host contamination. To enable a direct comparison among all our viral libraries, we randomly sampled 5 million reads for each sample. This choice reflects a realistic sequencing process in production and allowed us to obtain a high average coverage (e.g. over 1000-fold) of the target region as well as sufficient coverage across the genome, given that up to 99% of the reads are non-viral sequences and coverage is uneven. For each HIV clinical sample, we generated consensus sequence that covers over 96% of the target region (Table 1 ). In 7 out of 10 clinical samples, we generated consensus sequence that covers 100% of the target region (Supplementary Table S2 ). For WNV clone samples, we generated a consensus sequence that covers over 99% of the target region (Table 1 ).

To further evaluate the reproducibility of the method, we examined the nucleotide composition differences (Table 2 ) between any two assemblies. At each mismatch residue, the consensus base in the first assembly was considered to be consistent with the consensus base in the second assembly if the mismatch was supported by read alignments in the second assembly (Composition mismatches in Table 2 ).

Previous studies using Ovation RNA-Seq with HIV viral RNA used ex vivo amplification, large amounts of viral RNA, and utilized a reference-based assembly approach (39) . For several reasons, these conditions are not ideal for sequencing from clinical samples. First, most clinical samples contain a few picograms or less of viral RNA. In our study, we were able to study viral samples with femtogram and attogram amounts of viral RNA (over 1 million times less material than had been previously used) as input to the Ovation RNA-Seq system and generate sufficient dsDNA for Illumina sequencing. Second, ex vivo amplification is laborious and could lead to bias in sample generation during the 9 days in culture. We were able to capture complete sequence coverage of the CDS directly from clinical samples therefore generating sequence data more representative of the dominant viral genome within the infected individual. Third, we utilized a recently developed de novo genome assembly algorithm, VICUNA, to assemble a full-length consensus (Yang et al., manuscript submitted). Previous studies have shown (10, 41) that de novo assembly can significantly improve the accuracy of assembly and utilization of data compared with reference-based assembly approaches. In our study, VICUNA outperformed alternate assemblers (42, 43) which can result in stalling of cDNA synthesis (44) . This uneven coverage may be due to viral secondary structure. The VICUNA assembler is able to work with this highly variable coverage to generate full-length consensus assemblies for the HIV, RSV and WNV samples.",

In our Ovation RNA-Seq experiments, <37% of the total reads from HIV and RSV clinical samples aligned to rRNA (Table 1) .

It does not require prior viral sequence knowledge for primer design enabling the study of viruses with limited sequence data. The lack of viral-specific primers allows for identification of viral recombinants that might not be found with standard RT-PCR methods. Our method is capable of amplifying viral RNA genomes that are not successful by traditional RT-PCR methods. For HIV clinical sample B, four RT-PCR attempts were not successful in capturing the CDS, but in all six attempts with our method 97-100% of the CDS was captured (Table 1) . Furthermore, this method is easily applicable to multiple sample types. We applied the method to HIV, RSV and WNV samples without the need for optimization. Developing a robust RT-PCR process with viral specific primers can require a significant effort, up to several months (unpublished results), so that our method potentially speeds up viral genome sequencing projects. This method works with a highly variable virus such as HIV-capturing the entire CDS of the genome starting from only 100 viral genomes (Table 1 ). In addition, the process from viral RNA to dsDNA requires only 4.5 hours. Furthermore if this method were coupled with Nextera Illumina library construction (45) , one could generate an Illumina library in less than a single day. Although the Nextera method is very fast, the transposase-based method of Illumina library construction may introduce GC-bias compared with standard methods (46) . As only 5 million reads were necessary to assemble complete viral genomes, MiSeq or Ion Torrent sequencing (47) could be used. This would allow a researcher to go from sample to sequence data in less than a week. Finally, the Ovation RNA-Seq method is available in automated format allowing for high-throughput processing of clinical samples. As only 5 million reads are needed per sample, one could pool up to 96 samples per lane of HiSeq2000.",
