In this case, estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread -with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform agedependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China. We predict that R0 will be highest across Eastern Europe and Japan, and lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly.",

These estimated contact matrices are publicly available as supplementary material attached to Prem et al.'s paper. Here we use the estimated social contact matrix for China to define the early age-structured transmission dynamics; this is formed from the country-specific social contact matrix k and a vector of age-specific susceptibilities z -whose entries scale the risk of transmission from contact with infected individuals to susceptible individuals of each age class. Based on age-structured data from the outbreak in China, we can estimate z. We then combine z with Prem et al.'s estimates of the contact matrices in the other 151 countries to generate an estimate of an age-structured transmission structure for each of those countries. The basic reproductive ratio can then be estimated from these transmission structures to give us an approximation of the spreading potential of a COVID-19 outbreak in each of these countries.",

In countries with comparitively younger populations, contacts involving older individuals are less common and so the capacity of the infection to spread is reduced relative to the purely-contact pattern based transmission model.

By using a previously-estimated synthetic contact matrix and age-stratified data, we were able to estimate age-dependent susceptibility profiles based on the first 425 and the first 4,021 cases in China. We then combined these estimated profiles with estimates of age-stratified contacts in 151 other countries to give us transmission matrices for these countries from which we could estimate the scale of basic reproductive ratios in each country relative to China. We demonstrated that taking age-specific susceptibility into account results in substantially different predictions of transmission intensity by country relative to a model without age-specific susceptibility; countries with older populations are at substantially higher risk than countries with younger populations.",

            "text": "The predictions we have made are limited by two main elements. The first is the accuracy of the estimated contact matrices; although there are known issues (as discussed in [3] ) they remain our best estimate of agestructured contacts to date. Unfortunately, not all countries have an associated mixing matrix; many counties in Africa do not have the underlying demographic data to support the generation of the associated mixing matrix. Secondly, in inferring the age-dependent susceptibility, we are effectively generating a matrix R i,j which determines the distribution of secondary confirmed cases in terms of current confirmed cases. We are therefore assuming that either younger individuals are unlikely to infected or if infected they are generally asymptomatic and play a minor role in onward transmission. If such asymptomatic infections transmit equally to symptomatic cases, then the scaling of the reproductive ratio is expected to be closer to Figure  1 . Finally, it is worth stressing that these projections only inform about early phase of the outbreak in the absence of controls; the rapid and effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (contact-tracing, self-isolation and movement controls) can substantially reduce the reproductive ratio.",
