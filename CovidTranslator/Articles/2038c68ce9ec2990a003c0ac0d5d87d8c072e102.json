We analyzed the epidemiologic characteristics of HAdV infections and compared clinical characteristics of HAdV types. Among the 305 patients with acute febrile respiratory illness, we detected respiratory viruses in 139 (45.6%) patients; HAdV was the most prevalent virus (69 cases). Of the 40 adenoviruses identified based on type, HAdV-55 (29 cases) was the most prevalent, followed by HAdV-4 (9 cases). HAdV-55 was common in patients with pneumonia (odds ratio 2.17; 95% CI 0.48-9.86) and hospitalized patients (odds ratio 5.21; 95% CI 1.06-25.50). In soldiers with HAdV infection in Korea, HAdV-55 was the most prevalent type and might be associated with severe clinical outcomes.",

A total of 79 HAdV types have been documented (3) . The distribution of HAdV types differs substantially by geographic region and environmental factors (4, 5) . HAdVs are prevalent in training facilities or military barracks for soldiers, but the prevalent types of HAdV have changed over time (6) . Historically, HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 have been the most prevalent causes of acute febrile respiratory illness (AFRI) among US military personnel since the 1950s (7) . Vaccination against HAdV-4 and HAdV-7 has been effective in reducing AFRI among US military trainees to date (8, 9) . However, since 2007, the emergence of new adenovirus types such as HAdV -14, which is distinct from the prototype in the United States, has been associated with outbreaks of AFRI and severe pneumonia (including several deaths) in military populations (10, 11) .",

However, studies evaluating the types of HAdV in this population are limited because of the lack of knowledge about HAdVs among military physicians. In 2012, HAdV-55 was identified in patients with severe pneumonia, and an outbreak of AFRI among military personnel in South Korea was recorded (13, 14) . HAdV-55, which is a novel HAdV type characterized by genome recombination between HAdV-B11 and HAdV-B14, caused outbreaks of acute respiratory diseases in military camps in Turkey, China, and Singapore (15) (16) (17) (18) . Although cases of pneumonia caused by HAdV-55 among military personnel in South Korea have been recorded, information on the epidemiology and characteristics of type-specific HAdV respiratory infections among military personnel in South Korea is limited. Thus, our study aimed to investigate the epidemiology of HAdV infections and to compare the clinical characteristics by type of HAdVs in soldiers in South Korea via hospital-based surveillance on viral respiratory infections.",

PCR conditions were as follows: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min, annealing at 50\u00b0C for 1 min, elongation at 68\u00b0C for 1 min, and final extension at 68\u00b0C for 5 min. For samples that tested negative in the first PCR reaction, we performed heminested PCR by using primers (273 bp) ADHEX1F (5\u2032-CAACACCTAY-GASTACATGAA-3\u2032) and ADHEX2R (5\u2032-ACATCCTT-BCKGAAGTTCCA-3\u2032) with the same temperature and time profiles. We determined DNA sequences in both directions by using the Applied Biosystems Automatic Sequencer ABI 3730xl and ABI Prism BigDye Terminator v3.1 sequencing system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). We identified the type of HAdV by using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi).",

Nevertheless, we observed no significant differences between HAdV-55 cases and non-HAdV-55 cases in terms of the frequency of clinical diagnosis of pneumonia, hospitalization, and ARDS. These findings could be explained by 2 assumptions. First, specific HAdV types such as HAdV-3, HAdV-7, or HAdV-14 might be more virulent than other types (25, 27, 28) . Considering that the HAdV-55 genome is more similar to the HAdV-14 genome than the HAdV-11 genome, HAdV-55 infection could be associated with severe respiratory infection in certain patients (17) . Second, the lower levels of herd immunity against HAdV-55 could have an influence on the epidemic of HAdV-55-associated respiratory infection in soldiers in South Korea (29, 30) . Severe respiratory illness and outbreaks associated with HAdV-55 in soldiers in South Korea might be similar to those observed in military personnel in China (13, 14, 21, 22) .",

Our study has some limitations. First, the study was performed for a relatively short period (16 months) . Although the data might be insufficient to reflect the epidemiology of respiratory HAdV infection among military personnel in South Korea, the variation of HAdV type over time and the impact of the emergence of HAdV-55 on clinical severity can be observed. Considering the long-term experience of the US military with respiratory HAdV infection, the distribution of HAdV types might show a substantial difference in the military and community populations in South Korea. Thus, a surveillance system must be established to detect the circulation of the HAdV type among military personnel. Second, the study population included patients who needed hospitalization or an emergency department visit. Among soldiers in South Korea with HAdV infection, patients who had severe clinical signs and symptoms might be those who were primarily enrolled in this study. Nevertheless, our results suggest that of the several HAdV types, HAdV-55 and HAdV-4 might be implicated in HAdV respiratory infections among soldiers in South Korea. Furthermore, active duty soldiers and new recruits could have a substantial disease burden caused by respiratory HAdV infection. Third, we could not determine HAdV types in 11 cases. The viral titer in the clinical specimen might have been low and the viral DNA degraded because some respiratory specimens were not frozen until the molecular experiment. Using the 2-step hemi-nested PCR, we did not observe a DNA band in 11 samples. This study is important because it is a prospective study on patients with AFRI. Studies on the HAdV type in soldiers in South Korea since 2012 are limited. However, the previous studies provided data on the epidemiology of the HAdV type in patients with severe clinical manifestations or in those with HAdV respiratory infection. These conditions might result in bias in the epidemiology of HAdV infections among military personnel in South Korea.",

In particular, HAdV-55 and HAdV-4 were the prevalent types in soldiers with HAdV-associated respiratory infection. HAdV-55 was associated with severe clinical outcomes. Further studies are needed to verify which HAdV types are associated with AFRI in military recruits. In addition, studies on the introduction or development of an effective vaccine against HAdV-55 and HAdV-4 should be considered. ",
