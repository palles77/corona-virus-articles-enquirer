Results: HRV were detected in 252/620 (40.6%) of children; 8.5% in viral coinfection. Bronchiolitis (55%) and pneumonia (13%) were the most frequent clinical diagnosis. Of 202 inpatients with HRV: 72% required oxygen supplementation, 11% intensive care unit and 3% mechanical ventilation. HRV were identified as a risk factor for hospitalization (OR: 2.47).",

Seven of them were the most prevalent and circulated during limited periods of time. The demographic reconstruction revealed a constant population size and a high turnover rate of genotypes. Demographic and clinical outcome were similar for HRV-A and HRV-C infections. Conclusion: This study highlights the clinical impact of HRV in children without comorbidities as a cause of lower ARI and hospitalization. The high frequency of HRV infections may be associated with the simultaneous circulation of genotypes and their high turnover rate.",

            "text": "Interestingly, one HRV-A cluster could neither be genotyped as a known genotype nor as a new recombinant. The pairwise p-distance in VP4/VP2 of those strains obtained with the closest reference genotype was higher than 12.5%. According to the proposals for HRV classification, this finding suggests the presence of an undescribed genotype [7, 27] . Further studies sequencing the VP1 region are currently ongoing, to determine whether these strains corresponds to a new genotype. One of the sequenced samples was genotyped as HEV-68, usually associated with respiratory diseases [29] .",

The tMRCA for HRV-A and C was younger, and the estimated mean rates of evolutionary change for both HRV species were higher (10 \u22122 s/s/year), than previously reported (10 \u22124 s/s/year) [30] . Therefore, the estimated mean rates do not represent the mutation rate of each species, but could represent the turnover rate of HRV genotypes. Further studies including more strains from wider periods of time will be necessary to better determine these observations.",

            "text": "Phylogenetic analysis of Buenos Aires (BA) strains of HRV ( ) species A, B and C identified in hospitalized and outpatient children, from June 2008 to May 2010. BA strains are in bold and were named BA followed by an identification number, a status identification (HL3 stands for hospitalized less than 3 days, HM3 hospitalized more than 3 days, and A outpatients), and the sample collection date (dd-mm-yy). Reference sequences of all HRV species and genotypes were downloaded from GenBank. Phylogenetic tree was constructed by maximum likelihood, using the GTR + I + model for HRV-A, TIM2 + I+ model for HRV-B, and TIM1 + I+ model for HRV-C, using HEV-C to root the tree. Branch support was assessed by bootstrap (1000 pseudoreplicates); values higher than 70% are shown. Purple boxes represent HRV-A clusters, blue boxes represent HRV-C clusters. Branch distance is indicated by the scale bars at the bottom of the trees. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Seasonality and demographic reconstruction of HRV in Buenos Aires City, Argentina, from June 2008 to May 2010. Total rhinoviruses (green), species A (purple), species B (yellow) and species C (blue). The demographic reconstruction of the 7 monophyletic clusters (A1-A5 and C1-C2) corresponding to 7 different genotypes is represented in the temporal scale showing different common ancestors. BA strains were named by an identification number followed by a status identification (HL3 stands for hospitalized less than 3 days, HM3 hospitalized more than 3 days, and A outpatients). Purple boxes represent the time of detection of the five HRV-A clusters, and blue boxes, the two HRV-C clusters.
