Viable microbial burden within these cabin air parcels constituted only 1-10% of the total microbial population and ranged from below detection limits to 1.2 \u00c2 10 4 cells m -3 as determined with a validated ATP-based technology. Cultivable bacterial diversity was almost entirely limited to Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus and Bacillus. In contrast, cloning and sequencing 16S rRNA gene directly from the samples without cultivation indicated a significantly broader diversity, as sequences representing more than 100 species, and encompassing 12 classes of bacteria, were retrieved in varying abundance. Sequences of proteobacterial and Gram-positive lineage were retrieved most frequently (58% and 31% of all clone sequences, respectively), with Gram-positive and a-proteobacterial sequences dominating international flight samples and b-and c-proteobacterial sequences comprising the largest portion of those retrieved from domestic flights. Significant differences in bacterial load and diversity were noted between samples obtained on domestic and international flights. The disparities observed in microbial abundance and diversity further underscore the immense value of state-of-the art molecular assays in augmenting traditional culture-based techniques.",

At this rate, this percentage is likely to rise considerably with the number of international travelers expected to increase to several billions by 2020. Although the aircraft cabin is similar to other semi-contained indoor environments, such as homes and offices, in that individuals are exposed to a combination of external and recirculated air, it varies greatly from these environments with respect to occupant density, the inability of occupants to leave at will and the need for pressurization. Furthermore, while in flight, travelers encounter a combination of constantly regulated environmental factors including low humidity, reduced air pressure and potential exposure to chemical contaminants, such as ozone, carbon monoxide, various organic compounds and biological agents.",

One concern was the microbiological burden in enclosed environments, where passengers breathe continuously recycled air. The air provided to the passengers and crew on commercial jet aircraft is typically a combination of external air brought in through the engines and air that is taken from the cabin, filtered and recirculated. The environmental control system is designed to minimize the introduction of harmful contaminants into the cabin and to control cabin pressure, ventilation, temperature and humidity. An NRC report (NRC, 2002) found that most commercial jet airlines provide an ample supply of air to pressurize the cabin, meeting general comfort conditions and diluting or otherwise reducing normally occurring odors, heat and contaminants. The committee noted, however, that the current design standard of a minimum of 0.55 lb of outside air per minute per occupant (Federal Aviation Regulation: 25.831 ) is less than one-half to two-thirds the ventilation rate recommended in American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers Standard 62-1999, which was developed for ground structures.",

Prior to this investigation, knowledge of the microbiological composition in commercial airliner cabin air was limited to a sparse collection of cultivation-based reports (Wick and Irvine, 1995; Dechow et al., 1997; Hines et al., 2003; McKernan et al., 2007) . Although these studies have collectively reported a typical microbial burden ranging from 10 to 300 colonyforming units (CFU) per m 3 , these results are fraught with bias since a majority of all bacteria are not capable of growing in well-defined conventional media (Pace et al., 1985; Amann et al., 1995; Pace, 1997; La Duc et al., 2007a) .

Previous work has characterized the sampling efficiency of the BioCapture (BT-550) sampler using monodisperse fluorescent oleic acid particles and monodisperse fluorescent polystyrene latex particles (Kesavan et al., 2003) . The results showed that the BT-550 sampler had a peak sampling efficiency for 2-mm particles and the average peak sampling efficiencies for the sampler was 38% (Kesavan et al., 2003) . The flow rate of this light-weight (4.5 kg), field deployable sampler is 150 l min -1 (5.3 cubic feet per min). Each 750 l air parcel (roughly equivalent to the volume of air human lungs exchange every 2 h) was impinged into 5 ml of sterile buffered saline by running the sampler for 5 min.

Since ATP can originate from bacteria, archaea and eukaryotic cells, intracellular-ATP measurements are described as 'total viable microbial population,' while total ATP values are termed 'total microbial population.' Although the ATP assay has a very sensitive lower limit, prior validation studies of this technology have set a threshold of 10 3 relative fluorescence units (RLU) m -3 of air to strengthen conclusions drawn from data sets (Venkateswaran et al., 2003; La Duc et al., 2004) . The 16S rRNA gene copy numbers measured by the quantitative PCR (Q-PCR) assay are referred to as 'total bacterial population or 16S rRNA gene copies' because bacterial-specific primer-probe sets were used and because these estimates encompass viable and nonviable bacterial cells.",

Detailed description of the ATP assay to estimate total and viable microbial population was reported previously (Venkateswaran et al., 2003; La Duc et al., 2007a) . It has been documented that for most Gram-negative bacteria, 1 RLU corresponds to approximately 1 CFU, as compared to Gram-positive bacteria where 1 CFU corresponds to roughly 5 RLU (La Duc et al., 2007a) . It should also be assumed that in regularly cleaned, low-humidity, HEPA-filtered environments, such as aircraft cabins, cells exist in a suppressed metabolic state and contain less ATP than actively growing cells (Stanley, 1989) . Considering these circumstances, we conservatively estimated that a measurement of 1 RLU was approximately equal to 1 CFU (Venkateswaran et al., 2003; La Duc et al., 2004) .",

Each filter unit has a molecular weight cutoff of 50 000 Da allowing isolation of all intact bacterial cells and naked DNA fragments greater than 100 bp. Amicon units were reusable for each sample set, making it possible for all samples from a single flight (B20-50 ml) to be concentrated to a volume of 200 ml in a single filter tube. A comparable amount of sterile, unused cartridge buffer was concentrated in a separate filter tube to act as a control for each extraction. Total DNA was extracted for each concentrated pooling of flight samples using a standard lysozyme/phenol-chloroform procedure (Johnson, 1981; Ausubel et al., 2001) . We have previously reported the percent DNA recovery using this solvent-based DNA extraction method for low-biomass samples to be B10% (Bruckner et al., 2005; Bruckner and Venkateswaran, 2007) . Briefly, samples were treated with lysozyme (final concentration 10 mg ml -1 ) to degrade cell walls, followed by proteinase K and RNase treatment to remove unwanted biopolymers and finally phenol-chloroform to clean-up cellular debris. DNA was precipitated with two volumes of ice-cold ethanol, washed briefly with 70% ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer (30 ml) before being stored at \u00c080 1C. Bacterial small subunit rRNA genes (B1.5 kb) were PCRamplified (1-5 ml template) with a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA, USA) using eubacterially biased primers 8F and 1492R, as described previously (La Duc et al., 2004) .",

Comparison of paired sample sets was performed using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney's U-test. Comparisons of more than two sample sets were carried out using Bonferroni adjusted analysis of variance tests. All statistical tests were carried out at the a \u00bc 0.05 significance level. In addition, appropriate statistical analyses were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions using software specific for each assay or with the MS Excel software package. For example, an additional measurement was taken from samples when the coefficient of variation exceeded 10% for ATP analyses, and standard deviations were calculated from four individual replicates of each sample. Likewise, standard deviations from three replicates of each Q-PCR-amplified sample were generated and linear regression models were used to determine standard curves for each Q-PCR run. The averages of two measurements were calculated for each sample that underwent plate-count analysis. Rarefaction analysis (Heck et al., 1975) and coverage calculations (Good, 1953) were applied to estimate the representation of the phylotypes in bacterial libraries. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined as clones sharing 497.5% sequence identity (Stackebrandt and Goebel, 1994; Rossello-Mora and Amann, 2001; Lawley et al., 2004) . The rarefaction curve was produced by plotting the number of OTUs observed against the number of clones screened using the Analytic Rarefaction 1.3 software (http://www.uga.edu/ strata/software/index.html). The coverage of clone libraries was calculated according to Good (1953) using the equation C \u00bc (1\u00c0(n1/N))100, where C is the homologous coverage, n1 is the number of OTU's appearing only once in the library and N is the total number of clones examined. For the calculations, bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences from all samples were combined into one maximum parsimony tree using the ARB software package. Jackknifing (100 permutations) was carried out as described (Ludwig et al., 2004) .",

Pure ATP (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was decimally diluted and served as a standard curve for ATP analyses. Purified DNA from Bacillus pumilus ATCC 7061 was included in the PCR amplification protocols as a positive control. To prevent false negative results in PCR reactions associated with the presence of inhibitory substances, a known amount of DNA was extracted from B. pumilus and spiked (1 pg per reaction mixture) as an internal standard. None of the DNA extracts in this study inhibited the PCR reaction.

No patterns in viable microbial levels were observed either during a single flight or across multiple flights. Comparison of domestic and international samples using both Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney's U-test failed to detect a significant difference in total viable microbial population (P \u00bc 0.81 and P \u00bc 0.23; Table 2 ). On comparing heterotrophic counts with ATP-derived estimates of viable microbes, two flight segments contained no detected CFU (2R-N and 3R-L) and one flight segment showed no viable microbes (5R-N; Figure 1 ). Approximately 2 logs higher viable but yet to be cultivated microbes were noticed in 7 out of 15 flight segments (Supplementary Table 1 ) than corresponding plate counts. In addition, B99% of the viable microbial population was not cultivable in three sets of commercial airline samples, all of which were obtained on domestic segments. Two The solid bar represents cultivable bacterial population measured by R2A medium and viable microbial population estimated by intracellular ATP. Two measurements for cultivable bacterial counts and four replicates were carried out for total microbes. Number of samples for each flight segment is given in Table 1 .

With the exception of flight 1R-N, all domestic flights (5 h flight time) showed a strong negative correlation (R 2 \u00bc 0.51-0.84) between total microbes and flight time (Figure 3) . Five of seven international flights showed a very similar trend for the initial 5 h of travel (R 2 \u00bc 0.69-0.88; Figure 3) . A less consistent, typically weaker positive correlation between total microbes and sampling time was noted after the 5-h mark on several international flights (Figure 3 ).

Viruses (0.01-0.02 mm) and larger bacteria/fungi (0.1-1.0 mm) are retained even more effectively (Aviation-Safety, 2004) . Cabin air that has passed through an HEPA filter is considered comparable to the recirculated air used in operating , 1998) . When compared to standard office buildings, the air in a commercial aircraft is exchanged more frequently per hour and has even been described as 'sterile' by investigations carried out using conventional plate-count assays (FSF, 1998) . According to the limited reports available, it has been documented that airborne microbial levels within airline cabins are much lower than public areas on the ground (CDC, 1995; Wick and Irvine, 1995) . Unfortunately, these culture-based assessments of environmental samples grossly underestimate microbial levels and are ill suited for describing the community structures of the microbial populations that are present (Pace et al., 1985; Pace, 1997) . Indeed, biomolecule-based examinations of these 'sterile' air samples collected directly from blowing sources, such as overhead gaspers, revealed high microbial levels and biodiversity, suggestive of biofilm formation in air ducts . The power of molecular techniques in describing the microbial burden and diversity of the HEPAfiltered airline cabins examined was apparent, as heterotrophic plate counts typically underestimated total viable microbes by at least an order of magnitude ( Figure 1 ). Statistical analyses failed to detect significant differences between domestic and international flights with respect to both heterotrophic plate counts and total viable microbes, most likely due to constant HEPA filtration, maintaining consistently low levels of airborne microorganisms. Measurements of 16S rRNA gene copy numbers ( Figure 2 ) and total ATP (Figure 3) , however, showed large overall variation between domestic and international-bound flights. Linear regression analysis revealed repeated patterns in the levels of total ATP levels present over the course of each flight. Domestic flights (approximately 5 h in duration) and the initial 5 h of international flights typically demonstrated strong downward trends in measures of total ATP, which may be indicative of the progressive elimination of biological agents due to air exchange and continuous HEPA filtration. International flights showed a weaker upward trend in total ATP as flight time progressed beyond the five-hour point, possibly due to increase crew and passenger activity as the destination approached, or differences in air-handling protocols on longer flights. This much weaker association in the later portions of international flights indicates that a more complex set of factors may contribute to cabin cleanliness than can be correlated with the passage of time alone. Because exogenous sources (for example, food particles in the aerosols) could contribute to measurements of total ATP, the results of this assay cannot specifically be attributed to the microbial populations alone. They do, however, suggest that the length of international flight may have an impact on the aggregation of biological material that could, in the absence of HEPA filtration and air exchange, contribute to microbial persistence and proliferation.",

            "text": "Environmental cluster UniFrac analysis (Supplementary Figure 1 ; Lozupone and Knight, 2005; Lozupone et al., 2006) showed that the clone library composition of different cabin air samples did not cluster by any flight segment and was confirmed by Jackknife analysis. The only exception was the clone libraries from Sydney (8S and 8R-S), which clustered together with high confidence level (91% Jackknife analysis). When four samples collected from two separate trips to Sydney (segments 4 and 8) were subjected to UniFrac analyses, these clone libraries did not form any cluster. Analysis of biodiversity for domestic and international flights Figure 5 presents rarefaction curves and the population overlap for domestic and international clone libraries. The rarefaction curve for the domestic aircraft clones (n \u00bc 522) suggested better coverage of the biodiversity present aboard these aircraft. Despite a smaller number (n \u00bc 339), clone libraries of international-bound aircraft had a steeper rarefaction curve and demonstrated much greater biodiversity, being distributed among 62 bacterial species, while clones from domestic flights comprised only 42 species. Only 11 species were detected in both sets of clones, representing 26% and 18% of species detected on domestic flights and international flights, respectively. The cultivable bacterial diversity also indicated clustering of bacterial species with flight duration or destination. The isolation of staphylococci and micrococci on both domestic and international samples was expected, since cells in these genera are found in tight association with human skin cells, which are constantly shed. Interestingly, despite expectations that the artificially dry conditions aboard these flights would promote their prevalence, Bacillus isolates were not widely distributed across all flights and were limited almost entirely to longer international flights. It is important to note that while differences in microbial population structures correlated with flight duration, they may also be attributed to varying cabin design and air filtration on domestic and international flights. Internationally operated 747 and 777 airplanes have much larger passenger capacity (approximately two-to threefold) than that of domestically utilized 757 equipment (http://www.boeing.com/commercial). Passenger density as well as potential differences in air handling on larger planes may have significant impact on the biodiversity of air parcels obtained from these flights. Although distinctions were observed by clustering clones from cabin air samples by destination (international vs domestic), taxonomic groupings were also generated on an individual, flight-byflight basis (Figure 4 ; Table 4 ). Phylogenetic analysis revealed multiple monophyletic groups containing clones from a single flight, suggesting that each plane may harbor its own unique microbial consortium. Numerous DNA-based studies have noted that microbial communities vary significantly based on the location of sampling (Brodie et al., 2007; Moissl et al., 2007a, b) . Microbial populations aboard aircraft could easily reflect this phenomenon, particularly if planes are dedicated to particular routes of travel. Unfortunately, confirmation of this hypothesis would require disclosure from airlines on the regular deployment schedules of their aircraft.",

            "text": "The empirical results of this study indicated the presence of a wide range of opportunistic humanrelated pathogens, including causative agents of pneumonia, bacteremia, neutropenia and cerebellar lesions (US-HHS-Department, 2003) , and passengers and crewmembers are thought to be their principal source (Wick and Irvine, 1995; Dechow et al., 1997) . It should be stressed that the retrieval of 16S rRNA gene sequences from these pathogens is not in itself evidence for public health concerns over commercial air travel. The detection of DNA arising from these pathogens does not imply viability, and the human pathogens detected in plate-count assay were overwhelmingly opportunistic, posing little threat to healthy individuals. Furthermore, the combination of engineering controls built into commercial aircraft, including frequent air exchange, HEPA filtration and directed cabin airflow (Aviation-Safety, 2004), as well as our own cultivation and viable microbial measurements (Figure 1) suggests that exposure to disease-causing microbes in doses sufficient for infection is unlikely during normal airline travel. Although high prevalence of health issues among travelers and aircraft crew members has been reported (Low and Chan, 2002; Whelan et al., 2003) , these reports did not account for other factors that could be responsible for this correlation, such as travel-related stress on the immune system, or transient responses to environmental conditions within the air cabin. Recent studies have shown, for example, that symptoms experienced by air travelers, especially on flights greater than 3 h, may stem from low humidity (Nagda and Hodgson, 2001; Leder and Newman, 2005) , and that increasing the humidity of the air cabin by as little as 3% is sufficient to significantly alleviate physical symptoms commonly reported by air crew (Norback et al., 2006) .",
