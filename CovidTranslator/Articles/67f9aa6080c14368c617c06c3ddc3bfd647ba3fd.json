            "text": "Take care to minimize the handling of a rabbit in cardiac distress; a complete physical examination and further diagnostic testing must sometimes be delayed until the rabbit is clinically stable. Stress can be minimized by examining the rabbit in a quiet room and moving slowly. Rabbits are a prey species and thereby very sensitive to external stimuli. If necessary, sedatives may also be given to minimize the risk of self-injury. Sedation can be achieved with midazolam 0.5 to 1 mg/kg intramuscularly 45 or, for heavier sedation, a combination of ketamine 5 to 20 mg/kg and midazolam 1 to 2 mg/kg subcutaneously 13 with minimal cardiovascular depression (see Chapters 31 and Appendix). Provide flow-by oxygen as needed if a rabbit is dyspneic or becomes tachypneic with handling. In rabbits suspected of having cardiac disease or respiratory distress, focus the initial examination on observing the respiratory rate and pattern, obtaining the heart rate and rhythm, auscultating the thorax, examining the mucous membranes, and palpating the pulses. Normal heart rate is 180 to 250 beats per minute and normal respiratory rate is 30 to 60 breaths per minute. Peripheral pulses can be palpated at the central artery of the ear and should be strong and synchronous with the heartbeat. Two heart sounds (S 1 and S 2 ) are normally heard. Rabbits are obligate nose breathers; therefore do not occlude the nares.",

Rabbits with congestive heart failure often have tachycardia, tachypnea, and labored breathing. Pulses may be irregular or weak. Systematic auscultation of the thorax is the most important part of the cardiac examination. The entire thorax should be auscultated to localize heart murmurs and detect extra heart sounds (gallop sounds), arrhythmias, and abnormal lung sounds. A pediatric stethoscope allows better localization of heart sounds in rabbits and is preferred for cardiac auscultation; a larger-diaphragm stethoscope enhances auscultation of the lungs. Auscultatory findings vary among rabbits with congestive heart failure, and these findings are not pathognomonic. The examiner may hear muffled heart and lung sounds with pleural effusion and increased bronchial sounds or crackles with pulmonary edema.",

Congestive heart failure and respiratory disease can be differentiated by evaluating thoracic radiographs. Radiographic findings supporting a diagnosis of cardiac disease are similar to those in other species and include cardiac enlargement, pulmonary vascular enlargement, pulmonary interstitial and alveolar pulmonary pattern of pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion. Figures 20-1 and 20-2 show thoracic radiographs of a normal adult rabbit and a rabbit with heart disease, respectively. ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY Electrocardiography (ECG) is a simple and practical diagnostic test in rabbits with suspected or confirmed cardiac disease. An ECG is critical to diagnose and manage arrhythmias or syncope. The ECG may also be a helpful addition to the cardiac database. However, one should not use an ECG to assess or detect chamber enlargement or hypertrophy. Record the ECG with the rabbit in sternal recumbency. File the alligator-style ECG clips to minimize skin trauma, and place medical-grade alcohol or electrode gel on the clips to enhance conduction. Record tracings with a vertical calibration of 2 cm/mV and a horizontal paper speed of 50 mm/s. Normal rabbit rhythm is sinus and does not include respiratory sinus arrhythmia. 44 ",

However, in rabbits that are tachypneic or dyspneic, give oxygen by face mask during restraint. The echocardiographic exam may be performed in lateral or sternal recumbency. Standard views used to evaluate dogs and cats can also be obtained with the rabbit. Because of the rabbit's rapid heart rate and small size, optimal evaluation requires a high-frequency transducer and highframe-rate ultrasound machine. Two-dimensional and M-mode echocardiography assess cardiac structure, chamber size, wall thickness, and motion as well as extracardiac structures, masses, and pleural effusion. Color-flow, spectral, and tissue Doppler echocardiography assess direction and velocity of blood flow, further defining cardiac conditions with more insight on systolic and diastolic function. Normal echocardiographic values have been published for several breeds of rabbits (Table 20-2) . Sedative drugs used for restraint may affect cardiac measurements, especially alpha 2 -agonists such as dexmedetomidine and xylazine. Reduced percent fractional shortening, E/A reversal, decreased heart rate, and other changes have been documented with intramuscular ketamine at dose of 50 mg/kg and xylazine at 4 mg/kg. 54 Sedation with ketamine 20 mg/kg and midazolam 2 mg/kg given subcutaneously has been shown to be less cardiodepressive. 13",

In this rabbit, the diagnosis was multicentric, T-cell-rich, B-cell lymphoma with cutaneous involvement. 16 A 22-month-old rabbit that presented with acute unilateral exophthalmos was diagnosed with retrobulbar lymphoma. 61 In this rabbit, histopathologic examination identified the mass as a B-cell lymphoma of the Harder's gland, and the mesenteric lymph nodes, cecum, and both kidneys were also affected. In a rabbit that presented with pelvic paralysis, the diagnosis was spinal lymphoma of the sixth lumbar vertebra and concurrent pulmonary filariasis. 48 In this rabbit, the neoplasm was immunophenotyped as B-cell lymphoma and the filariasis was considered an incidental finding. In another case, the authors described a rare lymphoma that developed in the cecum of a 6-year-old pet rabbit. 24 Rabbits with multicentric lymphoma may exhibit nonspecific general signs, such as anorexia, lethargy, emaciation, pallor, diarrhea, and rhinitis, depending on organ involvement and location. In a 2-year-old rabbit seen at The Animal Medical Center in New York City, the presenting clinical sign was severe upper respiratory stridor. At necropsy, lymphoma was present in the nasal turbinates and sinus, stomach, liver, spleen, kidneys, lymph nodes, and bone marrow. Another rabbit with multicentric lymphoma presented with an acute onset of hind-limb paresis and gastrointestinal stasis.

In skin sections, the lymphocytes infiltrated the entire dermis and into *References 5, 18, 24, 57, 58, 65. the epidermis. The second rabbit had bilateral blepharitis that was unresponsive to treatment. At necropsy, superficial and deep lymph nodes were markedly enlarged, and lungs had reddened areas. Lymphocytic infiltrates were found in the skin, lungs, liver, kidneys, and heart. In the skin sections, lymphoid infiltrates were primarily in the subcutis and deep dermis. The third rabbit had nonpruritic alopecia of the left lateral thorax. Cutaneous lymphoma was diagnosed by biopsy of a skin sample; in this rabbit, lymphocytes infiltrated the superficial dermis and epidermis. The rabbit lived for an additional year after diagnosis, with no response to treatment with interferon alpha-2b (see \"Treatment,\" below). A necropsy was not performed. In all three rabbits, immunologic staining of tissue sections confirmed the lymphoma to be of T-cell origin. In a large retrospective study of cutaneous neoplasms in pet rabbits over 16 years, the authors reported a single case of lymphoma in the flank of a 4-year-old female rabbit. In this case, epitheliotropism was not noted. 62 In three clinical cases seen by one of the present authors (KQ), rabbits presented because of one or more subcutaneous masses. In a 7-year-old rabbit, cutaneous lymphoblastic lymphoma was diagnosed by excisional biopsy of a subcutaneous nodule on its dorsal neck. Three more masses developed within 1 month and were excised, but the rabbit died 2 months after the first biopsy. At necropsy, lymphoma was found in the cervical, mesenteric, and thoracic nodes. In another rabbit, a large, hemorrhagic mass was present on the ventral thorax. This rabbit was euthanatized. On histologic examination, lymphoma involving the skin mass and spleen was diagnosed. A 9-year-old rabbit presented with multifocal subcutaneous masses on the dorsum and ventral abdomen. Fine-needle aspirates of the masses revealed large-round-cell neoplasia. At necropsy, lymphoma was widely disseminated to the skin and subcutis, all abdominal organs, lungs, diaphragm, heart, adipose tissues, mandible, and incisor pulp cavity with marked intratumoral necrosis.

Diagnosis is made from cytologic examination of fine-needle aspirates or histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens. Clinically and cytologically, distinguishing thymoma from thymic lymphoma can be difficult. Tissue samples are often needed, since these tumors are classified based on the cells undergoing neoplastic transformation (epithelial and/or lymphocytic). Because of the difficulty in distinguishing hyperplasia, thymoma, thymic lymphoma, and carcinoma on the basis of gross appearance or imaging results, histologic examination is important.",

Physical examination findings typically relate to respiratory symptoms with nasal flaring evident, secondary to increased respiratory rate and effort. 28, 46 Auscultation of the thoracic cavity may reveal decreased or muffled lung sounds over the anterior mediastinum. 46 Although judged subjectively, decreased compressibility of the thoracic cavity in smaller breeds of rabbits may be detected as well. On thoracic radiographs, a mediastinal mass is identified (Fig. 20-5, A) and pleural effusion may be present. In a 6-year-old Netherland dwarf rabbit with pleural effusion, chylothorax was diagnosed and considered secondary to the presence of the mediastinal mass. 46 Uniquely, rabbits with thymic masses may have exophthalmos or present with prolapse of the third eyelids. 28, 60, 63 In rabbits with exophthalmos, the eyes can be retropulsed without evidence of pain, suggesting that the exophthalmos is not caused by the presence of a space-occupying retrobulbar mass. These signs are consistent with a diagnosis of cranial vena caval syndrome (precaval syndrome) caused by the space-occupying mass compressing the vessels of the anterior thorax and impeding vascular return to the heart. 4 The signs of paraneoplastic syndrome have also been described in rabbits and include hypercalcemia and exfoliative dermatitis (see Chapter 18) . 12, 26, 60 In one rabbit, the hypercalcemia (14.7 mg/dL) was described as a paraneoplastic syndrome similar to that seen in dogs with thymoma. 60 However, because of the unique calcium homeostasis in rabbits and the fact that the influence of diet and calcium metabolism on the plasma calcium concentration was not considered in this case, this conclusion is likely erroneous. Rabbits with thymoma may present with generalized scaling and sebaceous adenitis associated with thymoma. In one case, a paraneoplastic syndrome of thymoma-associated exfoliative dermatitis similar to the syndrome in cats was described. 12 In another rabbit that responded to treatment with cyclosporine and oral tryglycerides, an autoimmune reaction directed at the sebaceous glands and a defect in lipid metabolism was suspected. 26 Metastasis of thymic carcinoma in rabbits has been reported. 63 Rabbits with thymic masses may have a normal complete blood count (CBC), a high WBC count, or anemia. Heterophilia with monocytosis, eosinophilia, basophilia, and thrombocytosis was described in one rabbit. 1 In two clinical cases of thymoma, the WBC counts were 42,000 and 18,000/\u03bcL, with more than 70% lymphocytes. On microscopic interpretation of a blood smear from the first rabbit, the cells were characterized as small lymphocytes with cleaved nuclei and scant cytoplasm. A bone marrow aspirate showed no marrow infiltration. Both rabbits were eventually euthanized and no bone marrow involvement was found on postmortem examination in either one. On histopathologic examination, the masses in both rabbits were identified as thymoma.",

No change was seen in the lesions and all treatments were discontinued; the rabbit died suddenly 1 year after diagnosis. Anecdotal information is available on the use of chemotherapeutic agents in pet rabbits. The CVP/COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisolone) protocol, with or without doxorubicin and l-asparaginase, has also been recommended. 42 Because of the lack of information available on the benefits of chemotherapy in rabbits, the potential risks must be considered before treatment. In one study, rabbits that were intraperitoneally infected with spores of E. cuniculi were treated with cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg first dose, then 15 mg/kg weekly during the 12-week experimental period). 22 In these rabbits, clinical signs of encephalitozoonosis developed between weeks 4 and 6, and all died during week 6. No signs of infection were seen in control rabbits. These results indicate that immunosuppression induced by cyclophosphamide gave rise to lethal encephalitozoonosis. Therefore consider serologic testing to determine if a rabbit is seropositive for E. cuniculi before beginning treatment with immunosuppressive drugs (see below).",

In an experimental study of rabbits given daunorubicin or doxorubicin at 3 mg/ kg weekly for 10 weeks, cardiotoxicity was documented with daunorubicin but not with doxorubicin. 27 Both drugs produced hemotoxicosis manifesting as aplastic anemia. Rabbits treated with doxorubicin exhibited more weight loss and had higher mortality rates than those treated with daunorubicin. A single dose of l-asparaginase at 10,000 IU/kg when given intravenously can induce a hyperinsulinemic, insulin-resistant, diabetic syndrome in rabbits. 30 However, in small animals, l-asparaginase is currently given intramuscularly or subcutaneously; therefore route of administration may be a factor in toxicity. The neurotoxic effects of vincristine have been well studied in rabbits. 11, 40, 41 Rabbits with thymomas have been treated with immunosuppressive therapy. 1,39 Prednisone (0.5-2.0 mg/kg q12h) has been used successfully as adjuvant therapy in rabbits with thymoma undergoing radiation therapy. 39 Prednisone is used both for its antineoplastic and anti-inflammatory effects, potentially helping to ameliorate the side effects of radiating thoracic structures, in particular radiation pneumonitis. 39 However, in one clinical case of a rabbit treated with radiation therapy and prednisone (0.5 mg/kg q12h for 28 days), although the tumor regressed, the rabbit was euthanized 3 months after diagnosis because of lethargy and severe pleural edema. On histologic examination, the mediastinum was markedly fibrotic, with sterile granulomatous inflammation and thrombi found in mediastinal vessels. Chronic active pyelonephritis was also found, with numerous E. cuniculi organisms in renal tubular cells and lumens. In another clinical case of thymoma, the rabbit was treated with a low dose of prednisone (0.5 mg/kg q24h), with no other therapy. After 1 month, the tumor had not changed in size. The rabbit was euthanized 5 months later because of labored breathing and poor clinical condition.",

In a recent study of 19 rabbits with thymomas that were treated with radiation, median overall survival was 313 days; when 3 rabbits that died acutely during the first 14 days of treatment were excluded, median survival was 727 days. 1 Total radiation dose ranged from 28.8 to 48 Gy in rabbits receiving definitive fractionated protocols (\u22644 Gy delivered three or more times weekly) and 24 to 32 Gy in rabbits receiving coarsely fractionated protocols (defined as any other RT protocol). Complications associated with radiation were uncommon and included radiation-induced myocardial failure, radiation pneumonitis, and alopecia. Tumors may be considerably smaller after only a few treatments (see Chapter 35, Fig. 35-9 ). Rabbits have been used in research studies regarding effects of irradiation on soft tissues. 7, 9 Risk factors to consider with radiation therapy include the number of anesthetic episodes and radiation-associated side effects, including late-term side effects. Cost is also a factor, with definitive radiation therapy being the most expensive because of the number of treatments necessary.",

Surgical excision of thymomas is done successfully in rabbits, but the risk of surgical or anesthetic-related complications and death is high. In three rabbits treated with surgery alone, postoperative survival ranged from 8 months to 3 years. 1 Two rabbits treated with radiation therapy were also treated with surgical cytoreduction after completion of radiation. 1 In a series of rabbits with mediastinal masses treated surgically by median sternotomy and mass excision, 7 of 14 rabbits survived 6 months or longer. One rabbit died during surgery, 6 died within 10 days after surgery, 1 survived 6 to 12 months, 4 survived 12 to 24 months, and 2 survived more than 24 months (F. Harcourt-Brown, personal communication, 2010). In a clinical report, a right fourth intercostal thoracotomy was performed in one rabbit with thymoma and the mass was excised. A chest drain was placed, but pneumothorax persisted after surgery and the rabbit was euthanized. 60 In another rabbit, the mass was removed by median sternotomy. 4 A chest drain was kept in place for 24 hours, after which it was removed and the rabbit recovered uneventfully. When the rabbit was euthanized 9 months later because of recurrent appendicular neurofibrosarcoma, no evidence of thymoma recurrence was present. In a clinical case seen by one of the present authors (AP), the mass was excised successfully but the patient went into cardiac arrest and died approximately 28 hours after surgery.",

In three rabbits, the owners declined surgery or radiation therapy. Serial ultrasound-guided aspiration of cystic fluid was the only treatment done, and all rabbits improved clinically immediately after each aspiration. The procedure was repeated at varying intervals, usually at 3 to 6 months, as clinical signs of dyspnea or tachypnea recurred. In one rabbit treated with radiation therapy, the rabbit continued to develop large amounts of cystic fluid after treatment. Cystic fluid was aspirated periodically over a 12-month period to provide symptomatic relief. The rabbit subsequently died during surgery to excise the remaining thymoma.",
