The assay uses rabbit anti-CPV polyclonal antibody as the capture antibody, guinea pig anti-CPV polyclonal antibody as tracing antibody and anti-guinea pig HRPO conjugate as the detection system. The optimum dilution of the capture antibody and the tracing antibody capable of detecting the CPV-2 antigens was found to be 1:1 600 and 1:400, respectively, in the check-board titration. In this study, a total of 152 samples (129 faecal samples and 23 cell culture supernatant) were tested both by AC-ELISA and by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Of the samples tested, 69 and 78 samples were found positive by AC-ELISA and PCR, respectively. The AC-ELISA had relative sensitivity, relative specificity and accuracy of 88.4%, 100.0% and 91.4% respectively. The analytical sensitivity of AC-ELISA was estimated to be 10 2.8 TCID 50 /mL whereas PCR sensitivity was 10 0.8 TCID 50 /mL. The AC-ELISA is a simple, quick and reliable method for screening large numbers of faecal samples of dogs suspected of CPV infection.",

In India, the disease is widely prevalent and there exist about 25 million dogs with a high proportion of stray dogs capable of harbouring the CPV-2 without showing any symptoms. Since copious amounts of CPV-2 are shed in the faeces of infected dogs and the infection is easily spread among susceptible animals through faecal-oral route, rapid and early diagnosis of CPV-2 lead to proper treatment with high rate of recovery. The AC-ELISA for detection of viral antigens is an ideal choice as it is less time-consuming, easy to perform, having good sensitivity and specificity and well suited for screening of large number of samples. There is no indigenous ELISA kit available in India for CPV diagnosis and expensive ELISA kits are available only in few countries. So, the present study was undertaken to develop a polyclonal antibody (PAb) based AC-ELISA for detection of CPV antigens from faecal samples of infected dog and infected cell culture supernatant",

Similarly, 50 \u00b5g of purified virus particles in 0.5 mL of PBS along with 0.5 mL of FCA was inoculated subcutaneously in guinea pigs. Inoculation was repeated after 14 and 28 days with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) with same amount of virus particles. The test bleeding was done 7 days after the third immunization and the presence of antibody was detected by AGPT. Positive and negative antigen preparation Positive control antigen was prepared from MDCK cells grown in 75-cm 2 tissue culture flask to a near confluent monolayer and infected with CPV-2. At 96 hours post-infection (hpi), the virus was harvested and centrifuged at 3 000\u00d7g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in PBS, sonicated at 30 \u00b5 amplitude for 1 min and cell debris was removed by further centrifugation at 8 000\u00d7g for 10 min, the supernatant was taken and aliquoted for further use. Negative control antigen was prepared in the similar manner from uninfected MDCK cells and supernatant taken. Optimization of AC-ELISA In the AC-ELISA, the rabbit hyperimmune serum and guinea pig hyperimmune serum were used as capture antibody and tracing antibody respectively. ELISA plates (Maxisorp Nunc, Denmark) were coated with the capture antibody in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6 and kept at 37\u2103 with continuous for 1 h and washed five time followed by addition of tracing antibody to each well. After incubation at 37\u2103 for 1 h, the plates were washed five times with washing buffer followed by addition of 100 \u00b5L of 1:2 500 dilution goat anti-guinea pig horseradish peroxidase (HRPO) conjugate (Sigma, St. Louis, USA) to each well. The plates were incubated at 37\u2103 for 1 h, washed five times with washing buffer and freshly prepared substrate/chromogen mixture [4 mg Orthophenylene diamine (OPD) in 10 mL substrate solution containing 2.5 \u00b5L of 3% H 2 O 2 solution] was added to all wells. The plates were kept for 15 min in the dark at room temperature and the color reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u00b5L of 1 mol/L H 2 SO 4 . The plates were read at 492 nm wavelength on an ELISA reader (BioRad 680 Microplate Reader).

No excessive variations (<10%) between plates were detected and found statistically significant and found to be corroborated with Maree and Paweska[13] . TheAC-ELISA was able to detect different variants of CPV-2 such as CPV-2a, CPV-2b and CPV-2c. It detected various CPV-2 variants in the infected cell culture supernatant as positive and showed no reactivity with healthy MDCK cell culture derived negative control.
