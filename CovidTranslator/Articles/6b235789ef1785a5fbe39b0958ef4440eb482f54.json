In addition, cancer patients are at a higher risk of COVID-19, even if they have completed the anticancer treatment. More than 60% (65.6%) of cancer patients in our study were at the follow-up phase after radical anticancer treatment. For regular anticancer treatment and follow up, cancer patients need to visit hospital frequently, which increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and infection. Besides, cancer patients with COVID-19 might have more complications due to their old age, weakened immune system and the side effects of undergoing treatments. 12 14 Therefore, we recommend systemic screening should be conducted among hospitalized cancer patients. In our study, we also observed that ongoing anticancer treatment was interrupted in most patients because of the diagnosis of COVID-19. Fortunately, we had not observed tumour progression during the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia. On one hand, appropriately delaying treatment and reductive frequency of visit hospital for cancer patients is feasible. On the other hand, medical oncologists are recommended to provide professional consultation for COVID-19 cancer patients to ensure essential anticancer treatments.",

Outcomes of cancer COVID-19 patients By Mar 10, 2020, 14 (20.9%) patients had developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The other common serious complication was heart failure (n=11, 16.4%). Two (3.0%) patients presented with acute renal injury. In our cohort, 18 (26.9%) patients died from COVID-19, and 39 (58.2%) patients have been discharged. The remaining 10 (14.9%) patientswere still in hospital for treatment. The case-fatality rate (CRF) in this study for overall patients, patients at anticancer treatment phase, and at the follow-up phase is 26.9% (18/67), 39.1% (9/23) and 20.5% (9/44), respectively. We observed a tendency that patients at the follow-up phase might have a better prognosis than under treatment, but there was statistically significance(Figure 1, P=0.095). The median time from onset to severe events for severe cases was 10 (range: 1-21) days. The median durations from onset to recovery and death were 31 (range: 8-53) and 20 (range: 6-45) days, respectively.

The median age of patients who had severe illness was older than that of patients who had mild symptoms (69 vs. 64 years, P<0.001). Additionally, we observed that a higher proportion of severe patients had co-morbidities compared to patients with mild disease (71.9% [severe] vs 37.1% [mild], P=0.004). Of note, three of the severe cases had concurrent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and these individuals did not survive from the COVID-19 pneumonia. Nine (13.4%) patients have a smoking history. Forty-three (64.2%) patients had other concurrent chronic diseases, of which hypertension (53.7%, n=36), diabetes (19.4%, n=13), and coronary heart disease (11.9%, n=8) were the most common.
