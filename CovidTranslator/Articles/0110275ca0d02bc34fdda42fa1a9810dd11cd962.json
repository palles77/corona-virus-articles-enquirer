Driven by the medical importance of this virus, as well as the lack of approved antivirals, research into the field of CHIKV antivirals has recently intensified. Potential therapeutics that have been reported to show anti-CHIKV activity in vitro range from known broadspectrum antivirals like chloroquine to novel strategies involving RNA silencing technology. Although most of the earlier efforts focused on compounds that target host components, some recent studies have reported viral targets such as nonstructural proteins. This article examines the reported in vitro and in vivo efficacies, as well as the therapeutic potential of these antiviral compounds.",

CHIKV is the causative agent of chikungunya fever, a disease characterized by myalgia, polyarthralgia, fever, nausea, headaches and maculopapular rash [1, 2] . Owing to mechanisms that are poorly understood, recurrent and persistent myalgia and arthralgia have been reported to last for years after the infection clears in some patients. A recent study with a macaque model suggested that the chronic phase could be caused by inflammatory responses toward persistent CHIKV in certain tissues, rather than an autoimmune-mediated response, as was initially believed [3, 4] .",

In 2005, the reemergence of CHIKV in several Indian Ocean islands caused outbreaks of unprecedented magnitude. In the French island of La R\u00e9union alone, one-third its 785,000 inhabitants were infected with CHIKV, resulting in more than 250 fatalities [1, 6] . Apart from the newfound pathogenicity, chikungunya fever cases reported during the La R\u00e9union epidemic were also associated with complications including lymphopenia, lethal hepatitis, dermatologic lesions and encephalitis [7, 8] . Cases of fetal transmission were also recorded, leading to miscarriages and neonatal encephalopathy [9] . Apart from the classical transmission vector, Aedes aegypti, an additional mosquito vector, Aedes albopictus, was noted during this epidemic. This was accompanied by a mutation of alanine to valine in the CHIKV E1 glycoprotein (A226V), which mediates viral fusion [1, 6] . A. albopictus, although native to Southeast Asia, is today established in almost all southern temperate regions [10] . To date, CHIKV has infected millions of people in more than 40 countries, including India, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, USA, Italy, Cambodia and Yemen [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

Treatments are usually symptomatic, with administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids to control arthralgia and myalgia [15, 16] . Given the efficiency of the mosquito vectors in establishing CHIKV infection in many geographical regions, there is an urgent need for the development of safe and effective antivirals against CHIKV to control symptoms and minimize complications in future epidemics. With the re-emergence of CHIKV in recent years, numerous efforts have been made toward the development of effective antivirals targeting CHIKV. This review highlights recent developments in the field of antiviral therapy for CHIKV infections. A summary of compounds that have exhibited anti-CHIKV activities is listed in Table 1 . The concentrations of compounds that produced 50% of the total anti-CHIKV effect (EC 50 ), as well as the concentrations that caused cytotoxicity of 50% of the cells (CC 50 ), are also displayed in Table 1 .",

The envelope proteins E1 and E2 form glycoprotein spikes on the viral particle surface. Initial binding to host-cell receptors is facilitated by the E2 glycoprotein. Upon receptor binding, the virus particle is endocytosed. Although studies in an A. albopictus cell line have suggested that endocytosis of CHIKV is clathrin-mediated [18] , studies in mammalian cells have indicated otherwise [19] . Apart from being clathrin-independent, endocytosis into mammalian cells has been found to be dependent on Eps15 and Rab5 proteins [19] . Acidification of the endosome results in the E1-mediated fusion of the viral envelope and endomosal membrane, followed by uncoating of the viral genome [20] . Translation of viral RNA by the host cell translational machinery produces the viral nonstructural proteins, which complex to form the CHIKV replicase [21] . The viral replicase generates more copies of the viral genome, as well as the subgenomic (26S) RNA [22] . The subgenomic RNA encodes the structural polyprotein, which is processed into C, pE2, 6k and E1 [23] . During export to the plasma membrane, the pE2 precursor is cleaved by furin to yield the mature E2 and E3 proteins [24] . Finally, viral components are assembled into nucleocapsids that bud out of infected cells, acquiring a lipid envelope with embedded E1 and E2 glycoproteins [25] .",

In addition, inhibitors of entry might target extracellular components, for instance CHIKV replication cycle. Upon receptor binding, the virus particle is endocytosed. Within the endosome, the pH lowers, triggering the fusion of the viral envelope and endosomal membrane. This releases the nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm which disassembles, liberating the viral genome. Once the genome is in the cytoplasm, viral nonstructural proteins (nsP1-4) are translated (using the host's translation machinery) and complex to form the viral replicase. The viral replicase then synthesizes a negative-sense RNA strand from the positive-sense genome template. The negative-sense RNA serves as a template for the generation of two things: the full-length positive-sense genome (which becomes packaged into the new viral particles) and the subgenomic (26S) RNA, which enables the expression of the structural polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1). Further processing cleaves the structural polyprotein into the individual structural proteins, including the capsid, which assembles together with the genome to form the nucleocapsid. As the nucleocapsid buds out through the plasma membrane it acquires a portion of the host plasma membrane with embedded viral glycoproteins that will form the envelope of the viral particle. Abbreviations: nsP, non-structural protein; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; pE2, precursor of E2.",

In addition, the difference in treatment lengths in both chloroquine trials could have had an effect on patient outcomes. The discrepancy in data from chloroquine treatment has also been observed with HIV-1-infected patients. Savarino et al.

The authors noted that it was important to use the appropriate dosage during treatment regimens.

Further investigations revealed that harringtonine inhibited production of nsP3 and E2 proteins, positive-and negative-sense CHIKV RNA, and caused a reduction in infectious CHIKV titers. Harringtonine has been found to inhibit the elongation phase of eukaryotic translation by competing with incoming aminoacyl tRNAs for binding to the A site in the 60S ribosome subunit [44] . The authors therefore postulated that the antiviral action of harringtonine could also depend on its inhibition of the eukaryotic translation machinery, directly interrupting nonstructural and structural viral protein synthesis and indirectly affecting all downstream products. Homoharringtonine, an analog of harringtonine with an additional methyl group, was also observed to possess anti-CHIKV activity. Interestingly, harringtonine and homoharringtonine displayed greater potency with a CHIKV strain carrying the E1 A226V mutation as compared with a strain carrying the wild type E1.

In vitro, MPA inhibited CHIKV-induced CPE across different MOIs in a dose-dependent manner (EC 50 = 0.1 mM at MOI 0.01, and 7.81 mM at MOI 100, CC 50 = 30 mM) [59] . A dose-dependent reduction in CHIKV genome copy number and infectious titer was also noted. The mode of action of MPA was traced to depletion of GTP pools and subsequent inhibition of CHIKV-induced apoptosis, resulting in decreased CPE. Addition of exogenous guanosine monophosphate (GMP) abolished MPAinduced inhibition of CHIKV infection. MPA-resistant SINV strains have displayed mutations in nsP1, resulting in a guanylyl methyltransferase with increased affinity for GTP, and it is possible that a similar mechanism could apply for CHIKV [60] . In addition, the authors noted that MPA treatment caused a reduction in infectivity of CHIKV from 3.33% to 0.148%, suggesting that an additional mechanism of MPA action could rely on the increase in mutation rates during viral genome replication owing to the lack of intracellular GTP [59] .",

As was observed in the harringtonine study [43] , Bordi et al. [71] noted that a CHIKV strain carrying the E1 A226V mutation was more sensitive to IFN-a treatment than a strain carrying the wild-type genotype. Protection against CHIKVinduced CPE vanished upon treatment of 0.5-1.5 IU/ml of IFN-a for isolates with the E1 A226V mutation, as opposed to 14 IU/ml for the wild-type isolate. However, the authors clarified that the genetic backgrounds of both isolates were unknown, and that additional genetic differences could have contributed to the observations. Nevertheless, it is worthwhile to ascertain the effect of the A226V mutation on antivirals, given that isolates carrying this mutation became more prevalent as the epidemic progressed in La R\u00e9union. Evidence for the in vitro antiviral effects of IFN-a, as well as the synergistic effects of IFN-a and ribavirin, warrants further exploration in suitable in vivo models.",

Treatment with 4 mg/ml of poly(I:C) before CHIKV infection at various MOI (0.01, 1 or 5) suppressed CPE for up to 72 hpi [73] . Under the same treatment conditions, CHIKV infectious titers were reduced by about 2-3 log 10 units at 24 and 48 hpi and 1-2 log 10 units at 72 hpi for all MOIs tested. Downstream studies indicated that poly(I:C) treatment induced secretion of IFN-b, which peaked at 4 hours post-treatment, as opposed to CHIKV-induced secretion of IFN-b, which peaked at 24 hpi. TLR3 expression was also upregulated during poly(I:C) treatment as well as CHIKV infection. A significant upregulation at the mRNA level was observed for IFN-a, IFN-b and interferon-inducible antiviral factors including 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and myxovirus resistance protein (MxA) upon poly(I:C) treatment in uninfected cells. It is probable that the antiviral effects of poly(I:C) are dependent on its immunomodulatory effects. Poly(I:C) has also been used as an adjuvant in vaccine research, and this is another possible application for this TLR3 analog [74, 75] .",

In particular, the authors observed that inhibition correlated with a decrease in the number of antigen-positive cells per CHIKV-induced focus, instead of a depletion in the number of foci. This implied that dec-RVKR-cmk impairs the spread of CHIKV to neighboring cells. Treatment of dec-RVKR-cmk before, during and after CHIKV infection also revealed significant inhibition of viral titer, indicating that dec-RVKR-cmk could inhibit early steps of the viral replication cycle as well.

Most of the antivirals discussed in this review are only in the preliminary stages of research and this can be attributed partly to the gaps in current understanding of the biology of alphaviruses. Among the potential therapeutics discussed are well-known broad-spectrum antivirals like chloroquine, ribavirin and IFN-a, which have displayed some efficacy in vivo. Having been clinically approved for other conditions, existing information on pharmacologic parameters of these compounds might aid more-extensive in vivo studies on their anti-CHIKV properties, expediting the drug development process. The recent discovery of novel antivirals targeting CHIKV components like nsP2 (ID1452-2 and Compound 1), replicase complex (5,7dihydroxyflavones) and viral genome translation (siRNA and shRNA) have shown promise in vitro, and further studies on their in vivo efficacies are warranted, especially because compounds with viral targets are expected to display lower toxicity owing to their selectivity. Nevertheless, compounds with host targets like harringtonine (ribosome inhibitor) and dec-RVKR-cmk (furin inhibitor) remain relevant to the antiviral discovery process, as shown by the FDA approval of host-targeting compounds like ribavirin.",
