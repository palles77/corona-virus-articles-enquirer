Live Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) cells in contact with fresh TiO 2 were found deformed and dead after 15 min contact. The cause of germicidal activity was discussed from the observed cell deformation, lysis and increased absorption at 1680 cm \u22121 in FT-IR spectra of the affected cells, which proved the oxidizing effect of fresh TiO 2 to cells. The deformation caused by the stretching of cell wall and pressure built-up inside the cell, led to cell burst and release of intracellular materials. The degree of cell deformation was found positively related with the wetting property of TiO 2 . Cells are negatively charged, for Gram-negative cell (thinner cell wall), a higher germicidal effect was observed than Gram-positive cells. The germicidal effect of TiO 2 gradually decreased after exposure to air at room temperature, as the wetting property decreased. This kind of germicidal activity was more effective compared to other germicidal process such as UVA/TiO 2 or Ag + . This shed light on designing new germicidal material either maintained by visible light irradiation, or by oxidation effect generated by reactive oxygen species.",

This strong germicidal activity appeared to be related to the wetting property. The high degree of germicidal activity detected within shorter contact time indicates the presence of a fast acting germicidal mechanism. Therefore, further investigation was carried out and discussed in this article, including the observation of cell deformation and FT-IR spectral change of cells. The importance of specifying catalyst storage time and condition in accurately describing germicidal tests and the results were highlighted.",

Its germicidal activity takes place in relatively short time The results of germicidal activity of both fresh plate and relatively fresh plate coated with Ag/TiO 2 are listed in Table 2 . For measuring the effect of Ag/TiO 2 without leaching of Ag, loaded cell suspension was blown-dry with compressed air. A high percentage (82.5% red) of non-viable cells was obtained, comparing with that on fresh pure TiO 2 (ca. 60% red). The measured distribution of stained cells according to their color after 20 min on freshly UV activated Ag/TiO 2 was (10.4 \u00b1 5.6)% green, (7.0 \u00b1 3.7)% yellow, (82.5 \u00b1 6.1)% red. Ag doping introduced extra germicidal activity, therefore, the fresh Ag/TiO 2 has higher germicidal activity than fresh TiO 2 and stored Ag/TiO 2 . This phenomenon was owing to the formation of reactive oxidizing species (He et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2007) . The state of Ag should be mainly in its oxides form (Ag 2 O), with very few Ag 0 existed (from thermal decomposition of Ag 2 O), as there is no reduction treatment applied (Liu et al., 2006; Kubacka et al., 2008) . For stored 0.5 wt.% Ag on TiO 2 (sealed in small petri-dish), total germicidal activity reached about 90% after 30 min. Cells distribution according to stained color was: 10.2% green (viable), 65.4% yellow, 24.4% red. The storage also caused a decrease in total killing, due to the gradual decrease of wetting property of TiO 2 .",

            "text": "Another reason accounting for the germicidal results in this article is the small volume of loaded cell suspensions to the plates. To simulate the contact of bioaerosol in air with catalyst, the loaded cell suspension volume was very small to allow good contact of cells with catalyst coatings, and this resulted in a high germicidal activity. During UVA irradiation tests, only ROS that comes in contact with the microbe can affect cell viability. The germicidal activity From microscopy observations, it is found that Yeast cells on fresh TiO 2 were deformed. Cells looked like kidney pea, basically with elongation at two ends and bending towards one side of the cell. The dead cells looked longer and larger, and some have red smear around. Intermediate compromised cell showed a nucleus which has moved towards the side of the cell wall away from the bending. Normal cells have a nucleus which appears free moving inside the cell. Some dead (red) cells looked like shuttle fish that had just released its inky fluids. The average size of normal cell is about 4-5 \u03bcm in diameter. The cause of cell deformation may arise from charge interaction between negatively charged Yeast and positively charged TiO 2 (around defect sites with more Ti 3+ and especially good wetting property of the catalyst surface). It makes the hydrophilic cell wall touch the surface more, lose its round shape and flattened up. The cell thus looks like a halfball instead of a round ball with increasing contact area between the cell and TiO 2 . A round ball shaped cell has the highest ratio of volume to surface. Suppose the surface of a cell is fixed and can not be stretched, deformation will cause a build-up of pressure inside the cell. The maximum diameter of half-ball shaped cell will be 1.15 times the diameter of original round balled cell, the volume inside the half ball is only 77% of its original round volume, thereby the cell may burst.",

Suppose that a cylindrical form plus two half balls at the two ends of the cells were formed, the stretched middle part would have a length of 0.83 time its diameter, then total cell length is 1.83 times of its diameter. The volume would equal to 85% of its original sphere form.

Oxygen vacancy was concluded as the cause of cell deformation and interaction between cell and TiO 2 coated surface. The degree of cell deformation was found positively related with the wetting property of TiO 2 . For Gram-negative cell (thinner cell wall), a higher germicidal effect was observed than Grampositive cells. The germicidal effect of TiO 2 gradually decreases after exposure to air in room temperature, as the wetting property decreases. This germicidal activity was more effective compared to other germicidal process such as UVA/TiO 2 or Ag + .",
