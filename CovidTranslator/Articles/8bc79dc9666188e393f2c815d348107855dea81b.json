Since isoforms containing exon 2-encoded protein (X2MBP) are expressed during myelin formation, we examined T cell reactivity specific for X2MBP in a disease characterized by remyelination subsequent to demyelination, multiple sclerosis (MS). T cell lines specific for X2MBP were derived from three MS patients as well as one healthy control. This suggests that candidate autoantigens in demyelinating/remyelinating diseases should include not only the major isoforms of myelin proteins, but also isoforms expressed aberrantly during a disease process since they too may be the target of a T cell-mediated autoimmune process.",

Characterization of the immune response to other candidate autoantigens in MS has also focused on the major isoforms of myelin proteins expressed in the healthy adult central nervous system (CNS) (Baig et al., 1991; Sun et al., 1991; Trotter et al., 1991) . However, several isoforms of myelin proteins exist. Alternative splicing of DNA yields at [east two isoforms each for proteolipid protein (PLP), myelin-asso-Correspondence to: R.R.

Four MBP isoforms have been described in humans with molecular masses of 21.5 kDa, 20.2 kDa, 18.5 kDa, and 17.3 kDa (Roth et al., 1987) . The healthy adult human CNS is composed primarily of the 18.5-kDa isoform which is encoded by exons 1 and 3 through 7, with a splicing out of exon 2 (Fig. 1) . The exon 2 containing isoforms, 21.5 kDa and 20.2 kDa, are thought to be expressed early in fetal CNS development in both the human (Roth et al., 1987; Kamholtz et al., 1988) and mouse (Newman et al., 1987; Jordan et al., 1989) . Exon 2 containing transcripts have also been found in relatively increased amounts during remyelination subsequent to MHV-A59 coronavirus-mediated demyelination in C57B1/6N mice (Kristensson et al., 1986; Jordan et al., 1990) . Since MBP isoforms expressed during remyelination may parallel those expressed during developmental myelination, we postulated that exon 2-encoded protein might be expressed in the adult human CNS during remyelination, and immune reactivity to this protein might exist. This could contribute to the pathogenesis of MS, since remyelination at the edge of MS plaques has been described (Prineas and Connell, Genomic DNA:",

The small number of individuals studied precluded analysis of estimated precursor frequency of X2MBP-specific TCLs in MS versus healthy controls. TCLs specific for 18.5-kDa MBP were generated in parallel from the same patients. Stimulation indices of 18.5-kDa MBP compared to media alone ranged as high as 200:1 (data not shown). The estimated precursor frequency of 18.5-kDa MBP-specific TCLs was significantly greater, (P < 0.0001), than the frequency of X2MBP-specific TCLs but this result was skewed by the large proportion of 18.5-kDa MBPspecific TCLs from one patient, DS (Table 3) .

TCLs specific tor X2MBP did not recognize 18.5-kDa MBP, indicating that the epitope was within the exon 2-encoded sequence, and not limited to the terminal overlapping amino acid sequences shared between the X2MBP 40-mer and exon 1-or 3-encoded sequences. Although the possibility of T cell recognition of a cryptic epitope within the exon 2-encoded protein cannot be excluded without studying responses to 21.5-kDa and 20.2-kDa isoforms, it is noteworthy that the 40-amino acid length of the X2MBP peptide almost certainly requires processing by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Since in experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, encephalitogenic MBP-specific T cells which mediate disease are capable of cytotoxicity (Powell et al., 1990) , we tested the X2MBP-specific proliferative TCLs for cytotoxicity. Indeed X2MBP-specific cytolysis was observed in X2MBP-specific proliferative TCLs with no cross-reactive lysis of 18.5-kDa MBP-pulsed targets. Conversely, the 18.5-kDa MBP-specific proliferative TCLs were cytotoxic for 18.5-kDa MBP-pulsed targets with no lysis of X2MBP-pulsed targets. Therefore, both the X2MBP-specific and 18.5-kDa MBP-specific TCLs are highly specific with no evidence of cross-reactivity. The 18.5-kDa MBP-specific cytotoxic TCLs have been previously described while the X2MBP-specific cytotoxic TCLs are a novel finding.",

The demonstration that PBLs from adults contain a population of T lymphocytes which are specific for a myelin protein isoform expressed primarily during developmental myelination and remyelination, with minimal expression in the healthy adult CNS, provides evidence that the list of candidate autoantigens in demyelinating/remyelinating autoimmune diseases may be more extensive than previously anticipated. In addition to assessing T cell reactivity to the major isoforms of MBP, PLP, MAG, etc., isoforms of myelin proteins with increased expression during remyelination should also be considered as targets of a T cell-mediated autoimmune process.",
