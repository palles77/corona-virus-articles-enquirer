The induction of antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune response at the site of virus entry is a major challenge for vaccine design. Here, we designed a strategy for non-invasive receptor mediated gene delivery to nasal resident DCs. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were prepared using a complex coacervation process and characterized for size, shape, surface charge, plasmid loading and protection against nuclease digestion. The pDNA loaded biotinylated chitosan nanoparticles were targeted with bifunctional fusion protein (bfFp) vector for achieving DC selective targeting. The bfFp is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of truncated corestreptavidin fused with anti-DEC-205 single chain antibody (scFv). The core-streptavidin arm of fusion protein binds with biotinylated nanoparticles, while anti-DEC-205 scFv imparts targeting specificity to DC DEC-205 receptor. We demonstrate that intranasal administration of bfFp targeted formulations along with anti-CD40 DC maturation stimuli enhanced magnitude of mucosal IgA as well as systemic IgG against N protein. The strategy led to the detection of augmented levels of N protein specific systemic IgG and nasal IgA antibodies. However, following intranasal delivery of naked pDNA no mucosal and systemic immune responses were detected. A parallel comparison of targeted formulations using intramuscular and intranasal route showed that the intramuscular route is superior for induction of systemic IgG responses compared with the intranasal route. Our results suggest that targeted pDNA delivery through non-invasive intranasal route can be a strategy for designing low-dose vaccines.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) are specialized antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play a key role in the immune response by antigen uptake, processing and presentation. Among all the APCs, the DCs are considered as the most efficient cells for induction and regulation of immune responses. 1 Various strategies employed to harness DC selective targeting of vaccine antigens have shown enormous potential at preclinical stage for designing low-dose vaccines. 2 DCs express a large number of endocytic receptors, such as C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) through which they recognize and uptake pathogens. Different strategies employed for targeted delivery of antigen to DCs utilize the help of antibodies or natural ligands against DC restricted CRLs. The antigen targeting to CLRs have resulted in augmented immune response, dose-sparing of antigen and skewing of immune responses. [2] [3] [4] Among CLRs, DC C-type lectin receptor DEC-205 (CD 205) receptor is best characterized. The DEC-205 is a member of type I C-type lectin receptor family, which is primarily expressed by immature DC in skin, lymph nodes and spleen. 5, 6 The intracellular routing of DEC-205 targeted antigens enhances loading and presentation of antigenic peptides on MHC class I and class II molecules, leading to priming of antigen specific CD8 + and CD4 + T cells, respectively. 7, 8 The in vivo targeting of antigens to murine DEC-205 receptor along with maturation stimuli has been shown to augment the efficiency of antigen presentation to both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells. 9 To achieve DC selective targeting of biotinylated protein antigen, we have previously developed a quadroma (hybrid-hybridoma) based full length bispecific monoclonal antibody (bsmAb). The full length hybrid-hybridoma based bsmAb can bind with biotinylated antigen through one arm and target DEC-205 through the other arm. 10 Targeting of biotinylated ovalbumin (OVA) using bsmAb reduced the dose of antigen by ~500-folds compared with non targeted antigen. However, quadromas produce bsmAb along with parental and unwanted heavy and light chain combinations resulting in lower yield. Additionally, the antibody-based biotin binding is several orders weaker than the streptavidin binding.",

The truncated core-streptavidin arm can bind with any biotinylated antigen and anti-DEC-205 scFv impart targeting specificity to DC DEC-205 receptor. Using bfFp we have demonstrated in vivo targeting of four different classes of biotinylated antigens, namely, proteins, peptide, gangliosides and plasmid DNA), as low-dose vaccines. 11 In vivo studies in mice with biotinylated OVA have shown that in the presence of bfFb and anti-CD40 mAb, both humoral and cell-mediated responses can be augmented. In this targeting formulation, low concentration of antigen (200 ng) in saline was adequate to achieve a strong immune response in mice. In the multiple antigens targeting strategy, we also achieved enhanced humoral and cell-mediated responses for biotinylated OVA, SARS Spike, Ebola glycoprotein (GP1), MUC-1 peptide, and anthrax protective antigen.",

As the positive controls, these formulations were also administered through intramuscular route (Table 1 ). In addition, the bfFp targeted biotinylated nanoparticles were compared for immune responses in the presence or absence of DC maturation stimuli (anti-mouse CD40 mAb). The agonistic anti-CD40 mAb binds to CD40 on DCs, resulting in activation of cells replacing the CD40-CD40L signalling via CD4 + T cells. 29 Anti-CD40 mAb has been used as adjuvant in combination with DEC-205 targeted protein based vaccines, 30, 31 and as an effective mucosal adjuvant upon intranasal administration in combination with influenza peptide encapsulated liposomal vaccine. 32 To examine the systemic immune responses elicited using targeted vaccines through intranasal (IN) or intramuscular (IM) routes, the presence of N protein specific IgG antibodies was analyzed by indirect ELISA on serum samples collected during different time-points (Day 0, 14, 28, 46 and 56). The serum IgG profile (Figure 5a) shows that the nasal administration of bfFp targeted nanoparticles in combination with anti-CD40 mAb elicits higher levels of systemic IgG compared to naked DNA vaccine formulation administered through IN or IM route. Additionally, the bfFp targeted nanoparticles in the absence of any maturation stimuli (anti-CD40 mAb) elicited significantly lower levels (*p<0.05) of IgG titer compared to bfFp targeted nanoparticles administered along with anti-CD 40 mAb. This trend was observed, when formulations were administered either by IN or IM route. As expected, the intramuscular group immunized with targeted nanoparticles along with maturation stimuli induced the highest level of antibody titers. Serum titers of targeted formulations (NP+bfFp) were significantly (*p<0.05) higher than naked DNA formulations following intranasal as well as intramuscular administration (Figure 5a ). In addition, in a separate set of experiment we found that immune response of NPs with anti-CD 40 mAb was significantly lower than that observed from the targeted NPs with anti-CD 40 mAb (unpublished results).",

Till date, there is no therapeutic treatment/vaccine available for containing future threats of SARS endemic or pandemic. 34 Since SARS is transmitted through respiratory route, the respiratory tract serves as most common route for virus entry and as a first-line of defense. It becomes mandatory to design a vaccine delivery system which can provide antigen specific mucosal immunity. The respiratory tract harbours local DCs subsets, which routinely sample and process innocuous agents. Hence, respiratory tract resident DCs could serve as ideal target for uptake of targeted nanoparticles administered through non-invasive means.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that N protein is highly conserved; therefore could serve as a stable vaccine candidate. 14 However, studies performed using N protein as antigen are based on systemic immunization and no attempt has been made to naturally mimic the route of viral infection and to target mucosal DCs. The logistics behind targeting of pDNA vaccine to DCs stems from the fact that the traditional intramuscular route of pDNA immunization results in the expression of antigens on myocytes. However, the myocytes are not professional antigen presenting cells thus can only present antigens though MHC class I pathway. Furthermore, myocytes do not migrate to draining lymph nodes and express costimulatory molecules, both of these features are essentially required for priming and activation of T cells. 35 Therefore, the main objective of this work was to investigate mucosal DC targeting potential of the pDNA loaded chitosan nanoparticles. The mucosal delivery of DNA vaccines mimic the natural mode of virus infection and induce both humoral and cellular immune responses. 36 Naked DNA is ineffective in crossing mucosal barriers, and it is rapidly degraded by nucleases. 37 Contemporary efforts have been directed to improve the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines. A wide range of strategies have been adopted in the literature to increase immunogenicity profile of DNA vaccines, such as the use of heterologous prime-boost regimes, co-expression of cytokines, electroporation and the use of viral and non-viral gene delivery vehicles. 36 In context of design of effective mucosal pDNA delivery, the non viral vectors such as polymeric nano/micro particles and liposomes protected plasmid DNA have shown better immunogenicity profile. These systems can specifically deliver the pDNA to antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages. Additionally, these delivery systems could be surface functionalized with targeted ligands to achieve DC-selective targeted delivery of plasmid DNA through different immunization routes. 22, 38 Numerous research findings have explored the nano/micro particles formulated using chitosan and their derivatives as gene delivery vehicles. 39 Chitosan is believed to show better nasal delivery prospects through two mechanisms. 40 First, the cationic charge on chitosan confers binding to negative sialic residues in the mucus lining the nasal epithelial cells thereby slowing clearance. Secondly, chitosan transiently opens the tight junctions to allow an increased paracellular transport across nasal mucosa. Additionally, the attachment of receptor specific ligands on chitosan microspheres facilitates receptor mediated endocytosis resulting in cellspecific delivery vaccine formulations. 41 We have synthesized biotinylated chitosan and used it for the formulation of pVAXN loaded nanoparticles. The biotin substitution on the chitosan backbone facilitates the attachment of bifunctional fusion protein (bfFp) through core-streptavidin arm and anti-DEC-205 scFv arm assists in guiding the nanoparticle toward DCs. The N protein gene was cloned in US FDA approved pVAX1 plasmid vector, containing a CMV promoter and BGH polyadenylation sequence for mammalian protein expression. Further, the nanoencapsulated form of pVAXN was found to resist nuclease digestion following incubation with DNAse I, which is vital for in vivo performance of the nanoparticulate formulations. The intranasal application of bfFp targeted nanoparticulate vaccines induces systemic and mucosal immune responses against N protein antigen. In addition, mere administration of naked pDNA or nanoencapsulated pDNA was not sufficient enough in provoking detectable serum titers against N protein. We speculate this could be due to the low-dose of the pVAXN antigen (5 \u03bcg/mouse). Contemporary studies have shown immune response following the use of pDNA encapsulated chitosan particles where a high dose of encapsulated pDNA or frequent dosing was used. 42, 43 From our results, it is apparent that both systemic and mucosal N protein specific responses were induced in mice by using bfFp based targeting of nanoencapsulated pVAXN. The N protein specific serum IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgG2b antibodies were elicited to higher magnitude when the targeted formulations were co-administered with DC maturation/ activation stimuli (anti mouse-CD40 mAb). The splenocytes were capable of producing IFN-\u03b3, a Th1 cytokine upon in vitro stimulation with recombinant N protein. However, a significantly higher level of IFN-\u03b3 was detected for targeted formulations compared with non-targeted formulation. Co-delivery of DC maturation stimuli with targeted formulations resulted in augmented IFN-\u03b3 levels, irrespective of the route of immunization.",

Balb/c mice (5 mice per group) were immunized with 5 \u03bcg of pVAXN on day 1 and day 21. The mouse serum was collected at day 0, 14, 28, 42 and 56 post immunization and IgG against N protein was detected using ELISA. The data are presented as group mean \u00b1 SD at various time-points. ELISA was performed at 1:100 diluted sera. (b) Detection of N protein specific serum IgG isotypes in mice vaccinated with different formulations. IgG isotypes were detected in serum samples obtained on day 56. The ELISA was performed at 1:100 diluted sera. Data are presented as group mean \u00b1 SD.
