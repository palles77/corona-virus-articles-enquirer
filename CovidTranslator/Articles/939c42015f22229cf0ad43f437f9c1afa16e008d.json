The region includes China and Japan, the second and third largest national economies globally but, at the same time, also encompasses 17 Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI)-eligible countries. 1 In a region this diverse and experiencing breakneck economic development, all stages of vaccine innovation, production, and consumption are represented, along with paradoxical overlaps of reliance on aid for vaccination programs in countries that also are vaccine exporters. While India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam are GAVI-eligible countries, they produce bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccine, oral polio vaccine, and measles vaccine for UNICEF, and India is a growing source for diphtheria-tetanuspertussis-Haemophilus influenzae type b (DTP-Hib)-containing combination vaccines for export and the supplier of a novel meningococcal group A conjugate vaccine for Africa. China, meanwhile, has exported a novel live attenuated hepatitis A vaccine to India, pandemic H1N1 vaccine to Chile, and seasonal influenza, hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis (JE), rabies, and meningococcal and typhoid polysaccharide vaccines to developing and developed countries.",

So, even among countries that otherwise qualify economically for GAVI funding (eg, India), substantial numbers of families can avail themselves of vaccines not covered by the national Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), resulting in a two-tiered system of vaccination, paralleling the public-private dichotomy of health care delivery in general. Practitioners serving these and expatriate families generally follow current US, European, or Australian vaccine recommendations or some modification of those schedules.",

            "text": "Perceptions of the value of vaccines and their risks also range widely, regionally and within individual countries, from largely enthusiastic acceptance and even demand for additional routine vaccinations (eg, for JE vaccine in southern and Southeast Asia) to a degree of skepticism equal to, if not more deeply and widely held, than antivaccine sentiment in Europe and the United States. Within the last 20 years, Japan discontinued all production and use of combination measles, mumps, rubella vaccine and routine childhood influenza and JE vaccination programs, largely owing to vaccine-related adverse events or public perception of their occurrence. Similarly, in Korea, parents have objected to routine JE vaccination because more cases of vaccine-related acute disseminated encephalopathy were suspected than naturally acquired cases of JE. 2 With the global spread of information, the thimerosal content of childhood vaccines has been as active a parental concern among middle-class families in developing countries as elsewhere. 3 From this mosaic, we have tried to describe some common themes, highlighting representative approaches and unique issues that hold a wider interest. Because they are covered elsewhere in this volume, we have not reviewed specific vaccines of regional concern (eg, pandemic influenza and JE vaccines) or vaccination topics common to developing countries (eg, initiatives surrounding injection safety, hepatitis B, measles and neonatal tetanus elimination, and polio eradication). We concentrate, instead, on other aspects of vaccine development and implementation, organized by the steps of vaccine development, approval, production, recommendation, and delivery. We also restrict our focus to childhood vaccines and vaccination and to selected countries in the region.",

Licensed vaccines use SMB, primary gerbil or baby hamster kidney cells and Vero cell line substrates and have shown efficacies from 85% to more than 95% ( Table 69 -1 ). [7] [8] [9] The Chinese-manufactured baby gerbil kidney cell (GKC)derived vaccine provided 100% and 50% seroconversion by immunofluorescence and neutralization assays, respectively, after three vaccine doses at 0, 7, and 28 days. In a randomized controlled three-armed trial, in which vaccinated subjects received three primary doses and a booster dose 1 year later, 15 HFRS cases were observed in 7,860 control subjects compared with none in 7,872 vaccinees and 20 cases in 10,196 unvaccinated subjects during a 48-month follow-up, for a protective efficacy of 100% with a 95% lower confidence limit of 77.9% ( P = .00003; cumulative bionomial probability). Efficacy of the primary series alone was shown as, in the year between administration of the primary series and booster dose, 0, 9, and 10 cases occurred in the three groups, respectively. Among 35 cases in the control and unvaccinated groups, 23 were caused by Hantaan virus, 10 by Seoul virus, and 2 by a virus of indeterminate serotype. Thus, the monovalent vaccine was protective against disease caused by the Hantaan and Seoul viral serotypes. No vaccine-related serious adverse event was reported during the trial, and mild local and systemic reactions were reported in 3.78% of subjects. Bivalent GKC-derived vaccine was more immunogenic and induced neutralizing antibody to Hantaan and Seoul viruses in 91.3% and 88.4% of subjects, with geometric mean titers (GMTs) of 18.27 \u00b1 2.21 and 12.47 \u00b1 2.16, respectively.

Immunogenicity of a two-dose primary series in small numbers of human subjects was variable, from 13% to 75% in plaque reduction neutralization tests and 77% to 97% in IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. 10 Importantly, in one study, plaque reduction neutralization test titers more than 1:10 persisted in only 14% of subjects 1 year after the primary series; booster immunization led to a rise to more than 1:10 in only 50% of the subjects, and the postbooster GMT (138) was lower than the titer after the second primary dose (203). A serologic correlate of protection has not been established, but these observations suggested the need for a booster dose at 12 months to maintain immunity.

Their impact is due to the high attack rates resulting in day-care and kindergarten closures and to the cases hospitalized with neurologic and cardiopulmonary complications. Aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, pulmonary edema, arrhythmias, cardiac failure, and shock can occur with an incidence as high as 15 to 30 per 100,000 in children younger than 5 years, in whom the case-fatality ratio has ranged from 1% to 20%, depending on the definition of a severe case. Brainstem infection, resulting in autonomic dysregulation, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary edema, but systemic inflammatory responses leading to increased pulmonary vascular permeability and direct injury of the myocardium have not been ruled out as contributing causes. Severe psychomotor damage frequently complicates recovery, with central hypoventilation, motor paralysis, and severe cognitive impairment, with developmental delay occurring in half of children younger than 2 years who experienced cardiopulmonary complications during hospitalization. 16 While these rates of death and disability would be significant to parents anywhere, the single child policy in China and similar family structures in Taiwan (having the world's lowest birth rate) and Singapore have focused even more public pressure on governments to control the disease. Rapid vaccine development and priority regulatory approval, analogous to the process for pandemic influenza vaccine, and advance market commitments have been discussed in some countries.",

Proof of principle has been confirmed in vaccinated rhesus monkeys, challenged by intravenous or respiratory routes or in pups of vaccinated pregnant mice challenged after birth, the recognized animal model established because of the poor susceptibility of older mice to EV71. Although only one EV71 virus serotype has been recognized, the virus has been classified genetically into 4 genotypes, A through D, with subtype C4 strains circulating almost exclusively in China and B subtypes circulating predominantly in Taiwan and Southeast Asia. Regulatory and political considerations may constrain the use of strains based on local molecular epidemiologic patterns.",

In a pivotal efficacy field trial conducted jointly by the vaccine developers and the provincial CDC, no case of clinical illness with ALT elevation confirmed as HEV (by IgM plus polymerase chain reaction positivity) was detected in 48,493 HEV-vaccinated healthy adult subjects, while 15 cases (12 due to genotype 4 strains, confirming crossgenotype protection) were observed in hepatitis B-vaccinated control subjects followed up for 12 months, for an efficacy of 100% (95% CI, 72%-100%). However, with a more sensitive case definition of any two of three HEV markers (HEV-RNA, IgM, or IgG anti-HEV antibodies) confirming a case, the vaccine efficacy was 72%. The vaccine was well-tolerated, and no vaccine-related severe adverse events were reported. Further trials in pregnant women, infants, and people with chronic hepatitis are planned.

However, the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN, including Brunei-Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) in 1992 initiated efforts for a subregional regulatory harmonization scheme to reduce differences in technical requirements and regulatory procedures for pharmaceuticals. The harmonization initiative was undertaken under the association's free trade agreement to remove barriers to regional commerce. A Pharmaceutical Product Working Group, formed in 1999, aims to harmonize pharmaceutical regulations of member countries to eliminate technical barriers to trade without compromising product quality, efficacy, and safety. Eventually, a subregional mutual recognition procedure similar to that of the European Union is envisioned. Importantly, local clinical trials are not required for registration under abbreviated pathways specified by the ASEAN Common Technical Dossier if the vaccine was approved and licensed elsewhere by certain benchmark regulatory agencies, resulting in a certificate of pharmaceutical product. By contrast, the national regulatory authorities (NRAs) of China, India, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan have required local clinical trials before or after registration (not unlike the US Food and Drug Administration requirement for a certain proportion of US study subjects in a new submission).",

At the same time, Hib vaccine still is not recommended in some jurisdictions with high per capita income (Hong Kong, Singapore). To some degree, the seemingly paradoxical recommendations of relatively high income countries in the region reflect different social expectations of personal responsibility in health care purchases (see subsequent text). As shown in Table 69 -1 , some national schedules provide optional recommendations for some antigens. The availability of inexpensive DTwP-Hib-HepB combination vaccines cannot be highlighted enough, as they have made possible the introduction of Hib antigen into schedules of economically disadvantaged countries that otherwise would not have adopted the monovalent vaccine. As shown in Table 69 -1 , in many countries where government tenders choose specific manufacturer products, specific combinations are recommended in the national schedule. In addition, for some antigens, provincial-specific recommendations address regional differences in risk (eg, for routine group AC meningococcal vaccine in China; for JE vaccine in Sarawak, Malaysia and for the Torres Straits, Australia; and for rabies vaccine [preexposure] in areas of the Philippines).",

In general, vaccines on national schedules are available at no cost in primary health centers or their equivalent (eg, puskesmas in Indonesia; polyclinics or government hospital clinics in Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand; village and county level Centers for Disease Control in China; village communes in Vietnam; public health centers and clinics in India and Japan; and at general practitioner [GP] offices in Australia). As a rule, the cost of vaccines is not reimbursed while they are available free in public clinics, so even in affluent countries, families may attend government clinics or hospitals to obtain routine vaccinations and well-child care (eg, in Singapore, \u2248 60% of families obtain vaccines through the government system of polyclinics and hospitals). However, to avoid long waiting times and rotating staff at public clinics, many families opt to obtain these otherwise free vaccines privately and to pay outof-pocket at pediatric, GP, or other private clinics. In addition, as newer vaccines may be delayed in their introduction to the national reimbursed scheme, it is common for parents to pay for these vaccines out-of-pocket; for example, in Korea, about 90% of children in Seoul are vaccinated with PCV7 through private purchases. As might be expected from the distribution of income, the proportion of children vaccinated in government primary health centers is higher in rural areas. Overall, approximately 90% of children in Thailand and 70% in Malaysia are vaccinated through public channels. In China, all vaccinations are under control of CDCs; therefore, nearly all Chinese children receive free EPI, as well as payable optional vaccines (eg, Hib, PCV7, varicella, rotavirus, and others) at public clinics.

Between 2005 and 2025, the birth cohort of Asia will decrease slightly from 76.1 to 72.2 million, and the population of children 0 to 4 years old will hold nearly constant while the number and proportion of adults from 15 to 64 years will increase dramatically, and the number of people older than 65 years will nearly double, from 250.6 to 480.6 million. A demographic crossover point with more adults 60 + years than children younger than 15 years, was reached in Europe in the 1990s and will occur within another generation in Asia ( Figure 69-2 ) . 33 With the exception of almost universal EPI programs of tetanus toxoid vaccination of pregnant women, adult vaccination has been viewed mainly in the context of travel, as in group A meningococcal vaccine for the Hajj, and in tropical Asia, influenza vaccine as appropriate only for travelers to temperate locations. However, the SARS and pandemic H1N1 outbreaks and the regional threat of H5N1 influenza have focused attention on routine seasonal influenza vaccination for the first time in many countries, beginning with elderly populations. 34 As a result of high pediatric vaccination coverage in developed countries in the region, JE has become almost exclusively a disease of adults older than 45 years, reflecting the intrinsic biological susceptibility of older adults to neurotropic flaviviruses and suggesting a future need for adult vaccination. 35 Hepatitis A, interestingly, is now principally a risk in the cohort of young adults who were raised in an era of economic development and improved sanitation and who therefore lack natural immunity but were born before routine childhood vaccination was implemented. 36 A catch-up program to fill this demographic \"hole\" has been recognized by adult vaccination recommendations in some countries. In China, adult measles vaccination is under discussion, as more than 100,000 cases have occurred annually in the last 5 years, 26% in adults older than 20 years and 28% in infants who had not received their first vaccine dose; respective proportions in the more economically developed Eastern provinces are 40% and 25%.

Urban crowding is likely to affect the transmission patterns of certain person-to-person transmitted diseases and even of infections acquired from environmental sources. Dengue, for example, is transmitted by mosquito vectors that are more prevalent in urban environments; the already great need for a dengue vaccine will almost certainly increase with the growth of urban centers. 38 While the growing size and number of large cities may increase transmission of certain infections, delivery of vaccine and of health care in general is better organized in cities than in rural areas. Specific interventions are needed to ensure that the existing disparity in access to health care between urban and rural dwellers does not widen.",

While vaccines are regarded by many as a public good to be provided as a government service, as mentioned, access to the increasing number of new vaccines is likely to be stratified by income level and ability to pay, as governments must choose among increasingly costly vaccines and other health interventions. As shown in Table 69 -1, pediatric societies in a number of countries promulgate recommendations emulating those of the US ACIP, and it is likely that these schedules, aimed at practitioners serving private-paying families, will diverge increasingly from the national EPI schedules benefiting the majority of children in those countries. How the public and governments will respond to an increasing disparity of what has been perceived as a basic medical service remains to be seen.",

These trends and the accompanying need to strengthen regulatory agencies in the region have been recognized by the WHO and NRAs. Revising and harmonizing guidelines and procedures to international standards and enforcing procedures in a consistent and predictable manner will improve the timely introduction to the region of vaccines developed internationally. As important, compliance with international standards will be required of regional manufacturers hoping to license locally developed vaccines more broadly. As many countries still rely on a certificate of pharmaceutical product, considerable investment in infrastructure and training will be needed for their NRAs to provide full regulatory reviews of new applications. Chinese manufacturers currently export a limited number of vaccines, mainly to African and Latin American countries, but their horizons undoubtedly will expand. Similarly, while nonconformity with international intellectual property conventions has been an obstacle to introducing internationally developed products to some countries in the region, governments and local manufacturers may find themselves taking a stricter view as they themselves develop novel vaccines.",

Many countries lack the laboratory capacity to test samples for lot release, and because manufacturing and testing technologies change rapidly, keeping up with new procedures and purchasing needed equipment are ongoing challenges. Continuous support also is needed to produce working quantities of reference standards, validation of new assays, staff training, and proficiency testing. As resources are unavailable in many countries to establish and maintain a fully functioning national control laboratory, a regional network has been proposed as an approach to share expertise and to divide workload, while at the same time standardizing methods and criteria. Field surveillance of adverse events following immunization is another area of pharmacovigilance requiring strengthening in many countries.",

Multinational companies have increased the number of clinical trials in Asian countries to reduce costs and to obtain local registration of products. Their activities are serving an important role in strengthening compliance with good clinical practices, as many groups conducting trials in the region have limited experience with these precepts and procedures. Countries in the region have an interest to establish and enforce clear guidelines, not only as hosts to an increasing number of trials but also because their manufacturers, as future sponsors of new products, will be accountable internationally to uphold recognized standards.",
