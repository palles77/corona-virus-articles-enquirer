FAN1 maintains genomic stability and prevents tissue decline in multiple organs, yet it confers ICL-induced anti-cancer drug resistance in several cancer subtypes. Here we report three crystal structures of human FAN1 in complex with a 5' flap DNA substrate, showing that two FAN1 molecules form a head-to-tail dimer to locate the lesion, orient the DNA, and unwind a 5' flap for subsequent incision. Biochemical experiments further validate our model for FAN1 action, as structure-informed mutations that disrupt protein dimerization, substrate orientation, or flap unwinding impair the structure-specific nuclease activity. Our work elucidates essential aspects of FAN1-DNA lesion recognition and a unique mechanism of incision. These structural insights shed light on the cellular mechanisms underlying organ degeneration protection and cancer drug resistance mediated by FAN1. \u2020",

Here we report three crystal structures of human FAN1 bound to 5' flap DNA and provide biochemical data to elucidate FAN1-DNA substrate interplay. We show that FAN1 forms an asymmetrical dimer to engage the DNA lesion, unwind the flap, and incise the unwound DNA intermediate. These results illustrate a highly unusual mode of DNA substrate engagement by FAN1 and provide insights into the critical role of FAN1 in ICL repair and in the prevention of functional decline in different organs. Moreover, our results should facilitate efforts directed at counteracting FAN1mediated chemotherapy resistance in cancer treatment.",

For crystallization, a DNA substrate with a one-nucleotide (1-nt) 5' flap flanked by two duplex regions of 10 bp, designated as 5'-flap (10-1-10) , was mixed with FAN1 373-1017 carrying an active-site mutation 2 D960A to prevent DNA cleavage. The duplex regions contained 1-nt (A or T) overhangs to facilitate crystallization (sequences in Supplementary Table 1 ). Three different crystal forms of FAN1 373-1017 in complex with the 5' flap DNA were obtained and they diffracted to resolutions of 2.2 \u00c5 (space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 ), 3.8 \u00c5 (P3 1 ), and 4.2 \u00c5 (P3 1 ), respectively. The structures were solved by the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) method using signals from iodide ions, which were included in the crystallization buffer for the P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal form, and subsequently by the molecular replacement method for the P3 1 crystals (Table 1) . All three structures were refined to good statistics with excellent geometry (Table 1) . Unambiguous electron density in the three crystal forms clearly reveals three distinct DNA conformations in the cleft formed by two FAN1 molecules ( Fig. 1a -d and Supplementary  Fig. 1 ).",

The SAP domain consists of a canonical SAP fold and a SAP' region that connects to the TPR domain. The VRR_NUC domain has similar fold and active site residues as the Achaea Holliday Junction resolvase HJC 13 , with a C\u03b1 root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 2.2 \u00c5 (Fig. 1f, g) . This indicates a similar mechanism of metal-mediated catalysis, even though no metal ion is present here due to the mutation of the metal-coordinating residue D960A. A comparison with the HJC structure suggests that the DNA substrate is oriented at the active site by residues K977/H832 (K48/R25 in HJC) for hydrolysis mediated by residues E815/ E834/D960/E975 (E9/S29/D33/E46 in HJC) (Fig. 1g) .

FAN1 alone is monomeric in solution 12 ; however, DNA binding promotes FAN1 dimerization in solution (Supplementary Figs. 3d, 8) . Consistently, our crystal structures reveal DNA-induced assembly of a \"head to tail\" FAN1 dimer via the TPR and NUC domains of the first FAN1 molecule interacting with the SAP domain of a second FAN1 (Fig. 1a-c) . FAN1 dimer-DNA interactions are observed in all three crystals, each with a distinct DNA-binding form (Fig.  1a -c). These include: (i) a \"substrate-scanning form\" (P2 1 2 1 2 1 crystal) wherein the DNA contacts one of the FAN1 molecules in the dimer (Fig. 1a) , (ii) a \"substrate-latching form\" (P3 1 crystal 1) wherein the DNA becomes engaged with both FAN1 molecules (Fig. 1b) , and (iii) a substrate \"unwinding-form\" (P3 1 crystal 2) where the DNA interacts extensively with both FAN1 molecules and the flap-containing strand is unwound and points toward the active site (Fig. 1c, 2a) . Within the asymmetric dimer, one FAN1 molecule (denoted as P FAN1) appears to play a primary role in catalysis by engaging the DNA in its active site and the other FAN1 molecule (denoted as A FAN1) plays an auxiliary role, facilitating substrate orientation and flap unwinding. P FAN1 and A FAN1 in all crystal forms are structurally similar, with the C\u03b1 RMSD of 0.8 ~ 1 \u00c5. Interestingly, an asymmetric arrangement of two MRE11 molecules has been observed in the structure of the MRE11-DNA complex 16 that functions in DNA double-strand break repair and signalling pathways, suggesting a similar strategy is employed for both enzymes to engage the DNA substrate and to prepare it for endonucleolytic incision.",

The helix \u03b1 9 seems to serve as a central core interaction module, while \u03b1 7 and \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 adjust their positions and orientations to adapt to different dimer orientations ( Fig. 2c-e) . These interactions are mostly electrostatic in nature, including extensive hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between the two FAN1 molecules. Notably, a more extensive interface is seen in the \"unwinding form\" wherein the two FAN1 molecules associate more tightly to unwind the 5' flap DNA. We carried out mutagenesis to validate the observed dimer interface (Fig. 2f -h and Supplementary Fig. 2e , 3) . As predicted from the dimer structure, a triple mutation K525E/R526E/K528E on the core \u03b1 9 interface greatly diminished DNA induced dimerization as revealed by protein crosslinking using the chemical reagent BMH (bis(maleimido)hexane) (Fig. 2f) , sizeexclusion chromatography (SEC, Supplementary Fig. 3e) , and SEC-multi angle lase light scattering (SEC-MALLS, Fig. 2i ). As a consequence, the substrate-binding affinity to 5' flap DNA (Fig. 2g ) and endonuclease activity (Fig. 2h) were substantially reduced by this mutation. Surprisingly, the mutant exhibited similar dsDNA exonuclease activity as that of the wild type enzyme ( Supplementary Fig. 4) , suggesting that DNA induced dimerization endows FAN1 with 5' flap-structure specific endonuclease activity, while the exonuclease activity may not require dimerization. Interestingly, the mutation R982E on the PVRR NUC side of the interface had no effect on DNA-induced FAN1 dimerization (Fig. 2f ) and 5' flap DNA-binding capacity (Fig. 2g ), but showed a slightly different binding pattern with 5' flap DNA (Fig. 2g) . It almost completely ablated both endonuclease and exonuclease activities ( Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 4 ). This indicates that R982E may perturb the dimerization conformation leading to catalytically unproductive DNA-binding.",

The P SAP surface facing the catalytic site constitutes the major DNA-binding site that recognizes the sugar-phosphate backbone of the duplex region downstream of the 5' flap (denoted as P Duplex). This surface is the most positively charged and conserved region of FAN1 ( Fig. 3a and Supplementary  Fig. 6a ). The binding is achieved through extensive electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding interactions (Fig. 3b ). This P SAP-DNA interaction locates the 5' flap site at the tip of the P SAP domain (Fig. 1a -c and 3b). Interestingly, the DNA in the \"substrate-scanning\" form is in a reversed orientation and consequently directs the 5' flap away from the VRR_NUC active site (Fig. 1a ). This suggests that DNA may bind in both orientations but only the correct one can lead to substrate latching and unwinding for subsequent incision.",

The observed \"unwinding-form\" likely represents a state with partially unwound DNA substrate, as the ssDNA region does not reach the active site for hydrolysis. Further unwinding toward the active site is needed to enable the incision at the previously reported incision point 4 nt downstream of the flap 3 . In the current crystal form, the side chains of A N452 from \u03b1 3 and A S460 from \u03b1 5 \u03b2 1 and the backbone carbonyl of P P979 provide three hydrogen bonds to the backbone of the ssDNA, while P L811 forms stacking interaction with a ribose ring. The compound mutation N452D/S460D/L811D led to substantially impaired nuclease activity (Fig. 3f) while preserving near-wild type binding affinity to 5' flap DNA (Fig. 3e) . This is consistent with the important role of these residues in guiding the ssDNA region to the active site in P VRR_NUC. The energy needed to unwind the duplex region may be generated by the extra interface of both the A FAN1-DNA interaction and the FAN1 dimerization (additional area of 1200 \u00c5 2 ) as a result of the change from the \"latching-form\" to the \"unwinding-form\".",

A single ICL at the branch point will prevent the unwinding of the duplex downstream of the 5' flap, and it also abrogated FAN1 endonuclease cleavage (Fig. 4a ). To determine how many base pairs must be unwound to allow FAN1 cleavage, the ICL was moved 2, 6, 12 or 16 base pairs away from the flap branch point. Strong inhibition of endonucleolytic incision was observed until the ICL was 6-12 base pairs or further away from the flap site (Fig. 4b) , which is consistent with the flap unwinding observed in our \"substrate-unwinding\" structure.",

SLX1, another 5' flap endonuclease, and FAN1 are thought to play overlapping roles in 5' flap processing during ICL repair 4, 18, 19 . However, while SLX1 cuts the ssDNA flap at the branch point 20 , FAN1 can create incisions both on the ssDNA flap and within the duplex region downstream ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 2) 3, 12 . This could be explained by the unwinding of duplex DNA followed by incision of the unwound ssDNA (Fig. 4a) , as suggested by our structural and biochemical data. FAN1 would mediate DNA incision further away from the ICL (Fig. 4c) . The involvement of FAN1 and SLX1 in ICL repair would expand the repair spectrum and properly incise various DNA structures or at different steps of ICL repair. SLX1 has been proposed to play a prominent role in ICL unhooking 18 , while FAN1 may be more involved in the homologous recombination reaction during ICL repair 1, 18, 21 .",

            "text": "The active site and the P Duplex interfaces of FAN1 are evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to humans, while the protein dimerization, DNA flap binding, and A Duplex interfaces appear to be unique to higher eukaryotic species (Supplementary Fig. 6 and 7) . In particular, the core \u03b1 9 helix (bearing residues K525, R526 and K528), essential for dimerization and nuclease activity in human FAN1, are substantially shorter or absent in lower species (Supplementary Fig. 6b, c and 7) . This suggests that bacterial FAN1 orthologs may use a different mechanism for DNA binding without protein dimerization. This difference may be due to the fact that eukaryotic FAN1 has evolved to work with other cellular factors, as it is recruited to ICL sites via the monoubiquitinated FANCI/D2 complex [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Moreover, the FANCI/D2 complex has been shown to interact with branched DNA mainly on the exposed positively charged surface of the protein complex 22 . Our structures reveal that human FAN1 also engages DNA in a relatively open conformation that would allow access by other binding partners. This lends support to the potential simultaneous and collaborative binding of FAN1 and FANCI/D2 to a stalled replication fork during its repair, as proposed previously [2] [3] [4] . The FANCI/D2-dependent ICL repair pathway is absent in bacteria, and different catalytic properties for bacterial and human FAN1 have indeed been reported recently 12 . FAN1 mutations 7, 8 have been implicated in aging and developmental disorders including chronic kidney disease 7 and mental ailments 8 . In this regard, FAN1 could help ensure organ health by minimizing the harmful effects of genotoxins to which the kidney is exposed and of potential ICL inducers in embryonic neural tissues during the period of rapid genome replication 24 . The elucidation of the human FAN1-DNA structure allows us to assess the existing disease-associated FAN1 variants 7, 8 via structural mapping (Fig. 4d) . Mutations of active site residues (D960 1, 2, 7 , K977 2, 23 , D981 3 , R982 3 , and E975 23 ) are expected to abrogate the nuclease activity, while mutations of residues located in the interior of FAN1 (G937 7 , Q929 7 , P867 8 , P654 8 , R658 7 and C871 7 ) could affect protein folding and thus disrupt the structural integrity of FAN1. Moreover, mutations of residues located on the protein dimerization (L477 5 , E437 8 and R982 3 ) and DNA binding (E437 8 , L395 8 , R706 8 and L477 5 ) interfaces likely perturb the dimer structure and impair the DNA-binding activity of FAN1. FAN1 expression has been found to correlate with treatment outcome in breast and ovarian cancers, with increased FAN1 expression leading to a poorer prognosis 11 . On the other hand, suppressed FAN1 recruitment to DNA lesions may account for the enhanced response to ICL-inducing chemotherapy drugs in lung cancer 10 . In these regards, FAN1 is a promising target for improving chemotherapy efficacy. Results from our study establish a structural and biochemical basis for understanding human disorders caused by FAN1 deficiency, and for the potential design of new anticancer treatments targeting FAN1.",
