            "text": "The study of infectious disease outbreaks is required to train today's epidemiologists. A typical way to introduce and explain key epidemiological concepts is through the analysis of a historical outbreak. There are, however, few training options that explicitly utilise real-time simulated stochastic outbreaks where the participants themselves comprise the dataset they subsequently analyse. In this paper, we present a teaching exercise in which an infectious disease outbreak is simulated over a five-day period and subsequently analysed. We iteratively developed the teaching exercise to offer additional insight into analysing an outbreak. An R package for visualisation, analysis and simulation of the outbreak data was developed to accompany the practical to reinforce learning outcomes. Computer simulations of the outbreak revealed deviations from observed dynamics, highlighting how simplifying assumptions conventionally made in mathematical models often differ from reality. Here we provide a pedagogical tool for others to use and adapt in their own settings.",

Consequently, outbreak simulation is increasingly used as a teaching tool. Approaches to simulating real-life epidemiological data range from simple (e.g. rolling a dice) to complex (e.g. electronic barcode scanning), resulting in the generation of datasets that can then be analysed for epidemiological parameters of interest (Moore, 2017; Hayward, 2017) .",

For instance, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, currently circulates at a sub-critical level causing sporadic outbreaks (Cauchemez et al., 2014; Cauchemez et al., 2016) . The West African Ebola epidemic caused over 28,600 cases between 2014 and 2016 (WHO Ebola Response Team et al., 2016) and its subsequent decline coincided with the emergence of Zika virus transmission in Brazil (Cugola et al., 2016) . Following an outbreak of pathogens such as these, initial investigations include estimating the potential for onward transmission (i.e. the basic reproductive number, R 0 (Anderson and May 1992) ) and understanding key epidemiological features to inform possible control policies. Such epidemiological studies have been crucial to understanding and managing the transmission dynamics of important outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, swine flu in 2009, and more recently for MERS, Ebola and Zika (Cauchemez et al., 2014; Riley et al., 2003; Cauchemez et al., 2009; WHO Ebola Response Team, 2014) .",

            "text": "Outbreak exercises are an established tool for field epidemiology training. Often employed by national and international public health agencies, different case studies such as foodborne outbreaks are used to train epidemiologists to track down the aetiological agent and then apply appropriate control measures (CDC, 2017a; Public Health England, 2017) . Case studies of infectious disease outbreaks are used in classroom teaching to introduce students to key epidemiological concepts such as the incubation period, serial interval, attack rate, and the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) (Ponder and Sumner, 2009; Betancourt-Bethencourt et al., 2016) . Other outbreak exercises are designed to train individuals as case investigation interviewers to increase the public health surge capacity (Gebbie et al., 2007) . In addition, virtual exercises and complex computer simulations which incorporate network models have been used as teaching tools (Huang et al., 2010; Neulight et al., 2007; Hsieh et al., 2006) . Furthermore, there are now numerous interactive online teaching resources that allow the user to 'solve' outbreaks by playing the epidemiologist (Barber and Stark, 2015; CDC, T 2017b; Center for Technology in Teaching and Learning, Rice University, 2017) . The University of Cambridge provides a selection of online games where the aim of the game is to infect as many people as possible using the characteristics of a specific infectious disease such as influenza (Cambridge Infectious Diseases, 2017) . More widely, the potential for virtual role-playing games which exhibit social dynamics, economies and player-objectives resulting in complex networks to be used as model case studies have also been considered (Castronova, 2003; Balicer, 2007) .",

Participation in a real-time simulated outbreak and analysing the resulting data reinforces and affords a better understanding of important concepts while gaining insight into the process of infectious disease transmission. To meet this need, Bellan et al. developed a pedagogical approach to bridge the divide between classical and dynamical epidemiology (Bellan et al., 2012) . This approach involved real-time simulation of a stochastic outbreak among participants, which ranged from university undergraduate students to academic professors, attending an epidemiology training course. We adapted the approach developed by Bellan et al. and used it as a teaching tool for postgraduate epidemiology students by simulating a five-day outbreak among five consecutive student cohorts (2012-2016 inclusive). Here we describe how we conducted the outbreak simulation and how the data are analysed. We provide the teaching materials for others to adapt and use in their own settings.",

Given that the time of acquisition, onset of symptoms (if any), onward transmission and recovery are documented, the latent, infectious and incubation periods can easily be calculated. When estimating the generation time, we use only successful transmissions, rather than all attempted transmissions, as this is the closest analogue to what is observed in real outbreaks.

The class size increased over time from 56 students in 2012-84 in 2016. Each outbreak showed different temporal transmission dynamics (Fig. 1) , however, each outbreak was broadly summarised by having one major chain of transmission resulting from one of the three seeds. A strong time effect was observed within each outbreak, with the majority of transmission observed within short windows of time each day when frequent contacts occurred. This is highlighted within the visualisation of the outbreak, which show long periods of inactivity (Supplementary Movies). This effect can be seen in the strongly multimodal distributions describing the students' behaviour (Fig. 2) . There was substantial variation in the cumulative attack rate, with between 26% \u2212 83% students uninfected at the end of each outbreak. Saturation effects were also observed in each year, with an overall decline in the proportion of infectious contacts that led to successful infections observed from day 1 to day 5, except in 2013 reflecting the observed low cumulative attack rate for that year.",

Active learning can take many forms and has been defined as \"engaging students in the process of learning through activities and/or discussion in class. It emphasizes higher-order thinking and often involves group work\" (Freeman et al., 2014) . A recent metaanalysis of 225 studies found that use of active learning in undergraduate science, technology, engineering and maths courses, improves exam performance (Freeman et al., 2014) . Active learning was also found to be particularly beneficial at improving performance on \"concept inventories\".

Epidemics 23 (2018) \u2022 Students need to make sure to put their name on the form and the names of those they have infected Over the five years, the class size increased, however, this did not appear to affect the ability for an outbreak to be sustained, with the smallest and largest class sizes (2012 and 2016 respectively) yielding the highest cumulative attack rate. Importantly, the outbreak never experienced stochastic fadeout across the five days of the outbreak, with new infections still occurring on day five in all years. Overall, the outbreaks presented with short incubation and infectious periods, but comparatively longer and more variable latent periods. The increased variance in the latent period, and subsequently the generation times, was typified by the strongly diurnal patterns in the behaviour of the students, with most events occurring within their timetable. It is interesting to observe the decline in transmission exhibited on the third day of the 2012 and 2016 outbreak, which could reflect the absence of afternoon classes on Wednesday. However, this effect is hard to be definitive about, with the outbreaks in 2013-2015 exhibiting low levels of transmission over the first three days.",

Sampling the generation time and recovery time directly from the observed distributions, rather than sampling from a Poisson distribution with a mean based on the observed data, markedly improves the closeness of the simulated outbreak to the observed outbreak.

Firstly, the simulation lagged behind the observed outbreak in 2016, due to the large amount of transmission that occurred on day 1 (see Supplementary Fig. 2) . The lengthening generation times in 2016 could represent a degree of waning enthusiasm from the students, which would invalidate the time-independent sampling used within the simulations. Secondly, the long latent times exhibited at the beginning of the 2013-2015 outbreaks, combined with a burst of shorter generation times at the end of these outbreaks, yields another time-dependant effect upon the distribution of generation times. These effects, combined with the lower population mean number of secondary infections observed in these years, offer a potential explanation for the poor predictions afforded by the simulations. Additionally, these effects also demonstrate a teaching point concerning the potential for time dependent effects to occur in outbreaks, representative of real outbreaks (Chowell et al., 2015; Nishiura, 2010) , and the difficulties they present in mathematical modelling. The slower transmission in 2013-2015 is illustrative of commonly observed stuttering chains of transmission that occur prior to sustained chains of transmission (Dibble et al., 2016) .",

For example, a more advanced class with prior experience of epidemiological modelling could calculate clustering coefficients and path lengths to assess deviation from a random mixing assumption. For a larger class, students could calculate R 0 from the final class size and growth rate, and compare to the observed R 0 . The outbreak itself could be adapted to run over a shorter or longer time period (by altering R 0 or time in which onward transmission should occur) and could also be elaborated by looking at the impact of interventions to reduce transmission, such as vaccination, whereby some students are immune to infection. As noted by Bellan et al., the outbreak could be elaborated to include multiple pathogen strains with different properties (such as infectiousness, symptomatic proportion and infectious period).",

Firstly, the paper 'inocula' form was largely well completed by students, however, there were a number of missing data. A large degree of the missing information could be imputed once all the data was collected, but there is no guarantee that participants will always fill the form in fully or accurately. This represents a key issue in data collection (Owada et al., 2016) , one which is often addressed with the design of more intuitive and robust surveillance tools and software. To address this, an online form, utilising both automated data fields and required data entry fields, has been designed for use in the future as an alternative to the paper form (see Supplementary Form) . It is hoped that this will also strengthen participant engagement and will help prevent students 'forgetting' about the outbreak, which appeared to occur on a few occasions when observed latent periods were greater than 48 hours (see Supplementary Fig. 3) . Secondly, the initial practical spreadsheet was designed to emphasise how epidemiological quantities such as the generation time and latent periods are calculated, as well as for plotting the outbreak time series. While this was helpful for introducing these calculations, we found that this analysis was overly time consuming and reduced the ability to explore additional epidemiological concepts such as the cumulative attack rate and saturation effects. Consequently, we redesigned the spreadsheet to automate specific sections of the analysis, thereby improving the pedagogical experience (see Supplementary Datasets).",

The approach could readily be modified for other settings, for example over a longer or shorter period of time and is a useful method to engage students and reinforce key epidemiological concepts in a \"real-world\" setting. In addition, the R package is freely available for extension and adaptation to consider alternative epidemiological questions and analysis and provides a framework to introduce discrete-time models.",
