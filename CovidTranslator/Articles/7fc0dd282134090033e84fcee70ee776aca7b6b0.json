            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. 1 The specific microbiologic etiology of CAP is frequently difficult to identify, but recent studies suggest that viral pathogens account for approximately 29%-39% of total cases. 2, 3 The inability to differentiate between a bacterial or viral etiology in CAP based on clinical presentation, physical findings, radiographic findings and routine microbiologic cultures makes selection of therapy difficult, and typically all cases are treated empirically for a bacterial process. Development in molecular diagnostic techniques may help to alleviate this situation. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology has been recently introduced into clinical laboratories and may facilitate the identification of a panel of potential respiratory pathogens that are responsible for the cause of CAP. Respiratory viral panel (RVP) PCR-based technology can detect multiple viral pathogens and is a very sensitive and specific diagnostic tool which offers the potential of allowing physicians to make a specific diagnosis of viral pneumonia. However, it remains unclear whether this improvement in diagnostic accuracy will lead to a reduction in unnecessary antibiotic utilization in the hospitalized CAP patient. Several studies have found that viral PCR testing did not reduce antibiotic utilization in inpatient settings. [4] [5] [6] It is important to evaluate the use of antibiotic therapy in inpatients with viral pneumonia because unnecessary antibiotic therapy may foster the development of multidrug-resistant organisms and increase the risk for Clostridium difficile colitis. 7, 8 In an effort to address these issues, we performed an analysis of antibiotic use among RVP PCR-positive versus -negative inpatients diagnosed with CAP to determine whether using this new technology has any impact on reducing antibiotic utilization in patients with viral pneumonia. In addition, we evaluated the clinical characteristics and outcomes in CAP in these 2 groups of patients.",

However, there was no significant difference in the median total duration of antibiotic therapy between these 2 groups of patients, which is consistent with previous studies. 7, 8 Our study suggests that physicians hesitate to discontinue antibiotic therapy even when patients are found to have viral pneumonia using a highly sensitive and specific PCR methodology. The clinical challenge in the syndrome of viral pneumonia is the issue of coinfection with bacterial pathogens, which has been reported to occur in 14%-40% of cases. 9 The decision to continue antibiotic therapy despite microbiologic evidence for a viral etiology depends on multiple clinical factors, including severity of illness, radiographic imaging results, laboratory studies including white blood cell count, and comorbidities. Our study revealed that leukocytosis and age >65 years were significantly associated with RVP PCR-negative cases, suggesting that application of additional clinical and laboratory markers combined with RVP PCR testing may assist physicians in identifying which patients may be appropriate for discontinuing antibiotics. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker which has been found to be valuable in differentiating between bacterial and viral pneumonia in the clinical setting. 10 Low serum PCT levels argue against a bacterial etiology for CAP. Combining the results of RVP PCR testing and PCT testing may reassure physicians that patients with viral pneumonia do not have a bacterial superinfection, which in turn should result in decreasing antibiotic overutilization. Studies evaluating the use of antibiotic therapy in CAP patients where both RVP PCR and PCT testing are used would be beneficial.",
