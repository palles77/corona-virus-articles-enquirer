Meanwhile, the World Health Organization (WHO) has named the virus-infected pneumonia coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [4] . As at 5 March 2020, a total of 80,409 COVID-19 cases and 3,012 deaths (3.75%) have been reported in mainland China [5] . The 52,045 recovered cases (64.73%) were further quarantined at home for at least 2 weeks [5] . However, potential infectivity of these recovered cases was still unclear. Thus, we implemented consecutive virus surveillance among medical staff recovered from COVID-19 at our hospital and aimed to investigate their potential infectivity after discharge.",

Briefly, the RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 amplifies simultaneously two target genes: open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and the ORF for the nucleocapsid protein (N). Target 1 (ORF1ab): forward primer CCCTGTGGGTTTTACACTTAA; reverse primer ACGATTGTGCATCAGCTGA; probe 5'-VIC-CCGTCTGCGGTATGTGGAAAGGTTATGG-BHQ1-3'. Target 2 (N): forward primer GGGGAACTTCTCCTGCTAGAAT; reverse primer CAGACATTTTGCTCTCAAGCTG; probe 5'-FAM-TTGCTGCTGCTTGACAGATT-TAMRA-3'. Positive (pseudovirus with a fragment of ORF1ab and N) and negative (pseudovirus with a standard fragment) quality control samples were tested simultaneously. A cycle threshold (Ct) value of less than 37 was defined a positive test, while a Ct value of more than 40 was defined as a negative test. For the cases with an intermediate Ct value (37-40), a second sample was tested and weakly positive was defined as a recurrence of Ct value of 37-40. The diagnostic criteria were based on the recommendation from the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention (China) [6] .",

Thus, the virus may not be detected in throat swabs, especially for cases without expectoration.
