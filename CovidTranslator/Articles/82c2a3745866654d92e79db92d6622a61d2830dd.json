Several viral diseases of livestock such as bluetongue, peste des petits ruminants, camel pox, equine infectious anaemia, chicken anaemia and sheep-associated malignant catarrhal fever are crossing their traditional boundaries. Emergence of new serotypes and variant forms of viruses as in the case of blue tongue virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, Newcastle disease virus adds additional level of complexity. The increased incidence of emerging and reemerging viral diseases could be attributed to several factors including deforestation and surge in direct contact of livestock and humans with wild animals and birds.

First and foremost is deforestation and the surge in direct contact of livestock and humans with wild animal species. As a matter of fact, most of the viral diseases listed above originated from wild animals and birds. Global expansion of cultivating land, population growth, intensive industrialization, changes in the atmosphere, the life-cycle and the movement of viral vectors, illegal and unscrupulous trade practices, and curbing the reporting of disease outbreaks are additional reasons. All these viral diseases are not only threatening livestock and human health, but also causing considerable losses to economy, trade and global travel. With nearly two-thirds of the global population (both human and livestock) living in the developing countries, it is not surprising to see that most of the emerging viral diseases originate from these regions. Unfortunately, many such unalarming incidences have developed into regionally serious or widespread or even pandemic diseases. Therefore, international cooperation, as well as scientific and political determinations are required to combat emerging viral diseases.",

The main reasons are inability of the viruses to infect and replicate in experimental animals and differences in the immune system of natural host versus experimental animals. To address these limitations, humanized mouse models have been developed. Such models would greatly assist designing of prevention programs, prophylaxis and therapeutic strategies, and diagnostic tools. In veterinary virology, similar experimental models play a key role for understanding the pathogenesis of viral diseases of large animals and wild species.",

Therefore, studies to decipher the molecular and cellular cross-talk between host immune cells and virus, documentation of immune evasive strategies of virus as well as systems biology approaches must be supported without bias. As compared to progress in humans, the immune system of domestic and wild animals is not yet explored in depth. In particular, the detailed phenotype and molecular analysis of antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages; the T cell subsets and B cells are lacking. This constitutes a major hurdle for developing effective control measures in livestock, and it can have a spillover effect in the case of zoonotic diseases.",

Importantly, more research is needed on vaccines and adjuvants, which induce rapid and long-lasting protective immune responses. Unlike bacterial vaccines, viral vaccines should induce both cellular and humoral immunity. While cellular immune responses clear virus-infected cells and reduce virus burden, humoral responses neutralize cell-free viruses. Although oil adjuvants have replaced alum in most of the current veterinary vaccines, further work is necessary to identify adjuvants with precise cellular and molecular mechanisms, to improve vaccine delivery systems and to promote new generation vaccines. Some of the recent inventions in human vaccinology and immunology could be considered for further exploration in veterinary virology. They include microneedle-based vaccine delivery systems, and adjuvants that target toll-like receptors, immunosuppressor cells such as regulatory T cells [1, 4, 5, 11, 13] . Advancements in the domain of foot and mouth disease virus could serve as an example and inspiration in this regard. However, cost-effective analysis of such new approaches is mandatory.",
