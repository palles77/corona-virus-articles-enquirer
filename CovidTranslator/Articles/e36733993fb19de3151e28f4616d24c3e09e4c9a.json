The world's inhabitants increasingly share the same air, water, exposure to infectious diseases, foods, pharmaceuticals, and health workforce. Through climate change, the impact of human activities in a few countries can affect harvests, the epidemiology of infectious diseases, and the potential for global natural disasters. 11 Even among countries with strong public health programs, harmonization of standards and processes is important for effective and efficient collective action. Today's global health governance structures include a complex web of UN agencies, public/private partnerships, donor and recipient governments, foundations, corporations, and civil society organizations. A recent report from the Kaiser Family Foundation identified 50 multilateral international health treaties, commitments, partnerships, and other agreements, 26 of which are legally binding under international law. The United States is a party to 36 of these of agreements, 16 of which are legally binding. These agreements cover many topical areas, including specific diseases, environmental issues, trade and intellectual property, specific populations (eg, refugees or children), health security/preparedness, water, and food/nutrition. 12 ",

Few other actors were engaged in global health. Since its founding, the WHO has celebrated major accomplishments but has also suffered from an erosion of its influence. Beyond the eradication of smallpox (an event that has likely saved more than 20 million lives since 1977), WHO technical leadership has also played a role in the near eradication of polio; the containment of the deadly 2003 SARS epidemic; the landmark 2003 WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the first treaty negotiated under the auspices of WHO); and the 2005 revision of the International Health Regulations (IHR). Compared with the previous IHR that was focused on classical diseases of international importance, plague, yellow fever, and cholera, the 2005 revision is more powerful and practical in that it encompasses all acute public health risks of transnational significance. The new IHR defines broad reporting requirements and establishes the authority of the WHO to initiate disease-control actions, if necessary, through use of information sources other than country governments. The new IHR also requires countries to strengthen their existing surveillance capacities.",

The WHO has, however, leaned more toward providing technical advice than toward exerting bold, proactive leadership through binding norms and regulations. 16 Kelley Given its mandate, the WHO is handicapped by a modest budget and by its dependent fiscal relationships. The proposed budget for 2010 to 2011 was $4.94 billion before currency adjustments. Because only about 18.8% of the WHO budget comes from the dues assessments of member countries, its flexibility in focusing its program based on the scientific priorities it determines is constrained. Wealthier countries pay larger assessments and thus have more influence over the direction of WHO programming than poorer countries, which have the greater need for help. Moreover, the remaining 81.2% of the budget is projected as \"voluntary contributions,\" which are largely earmarked by donors for specific purposes. 17 This arrangement contributes to fragmented programming and perhaps to certain donor-influenced compromises. In this century, the WHO also faces growing challenges. Although its members are sovereign governments, many other powerful actors (including nongovernmental entities, such as other UN agencies, foundations, corporations, and civil society organizations) have entered the global-health arena. Placating these competing interests is not a recipe for bold action.",

It also set out a policy approach to providing leadership; improving prevention, care, and treatment; preserving human rights; reducing the vulnerability of women and children at risk for or affected by HIV/AIDS; and mobilizing financial resources.

Based in Paris and having regional and subregional offices worldwide, the OIE is an important partner of the WHO, the FAO, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Like the WHO, it operates under the collective control and authority of an assembly of member countries. OIE relevance to global health governance stems from the often-underappreciated connection between human health and animal health. This connection, embodied in the one-health concept, is most evident in the context of emerging zoonotic diseases and food safety. 21 In 2009, an Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee concluded that the OIE rules lacked critical provisions found in the 2005 WHO IHR, provisions that would be valuable for an organization involved in protecting animals capable of transmitting infections to humans. The committee recommended that the OIE create legally binding obligations for members to develop and maintain core surveillance-and-response capabilities, that the OIE be authorized to publically disseminate the animal-disease information received from nongovernmental sources when the member state does not do so in a timely and accurate way, and that the OIE director general be empowered to declare animalhealth emergencies and related recommendations as appropriate. 22 The WTO, a member of the UN family since 1995, is primarily concerned with the rules of trade between nations. With globalization, however, trade and health are increasingly connected. The WTO has several agreements related to health and health policies, including the Agreements on Technical Barriers to Trade; the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures; the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS); and the Trade in Services. Although trade can be restrained for scientifically valid reasons related to health, relevant interpretations can be controversial. Some health issues relevant to WTO agreements include food safety and protection from zoonotic diseases; TRIPS patent protection for pharmaceuticals (to balance incentives for drug development vs ensuring affordable access to drugs); tobacco control; biotechnology; and the transnational migrations of health workers, patients, and investment in health services. 23 The World Bank Group, founded in 1944, is a critical source of financial and technical help for developing countries. Headquartered in Washington, DC, it employs more than 10,000 people worldwide. The bank provides low-interest loans, interest-free credits, and grants to developing countries for health and other purposes. The World Bank consists primarily of 2 unique development institutions owned by 187 member countries: the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA). The IBRD serves middle-income and creditworthy poorer countries; whereas, the IDA mission is to serve the world's poorest countries. IBRD lending is primarily financed through AAA-rated bonds sold on the world's financial markets; the IDA funds come from 40 donor countries and are replenished periodically. Additional funds come from repayments of loan principal on longterm, no-interest loans. The IDA accounts for more than 40% of World Bank lending, and its loans are largely supervised and evaluated by the World Bank country offices. IDA loans have been used to improve sanitation and water supplies, support immunization programs, and combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic.",

            "text": "In 2002, the UN Millennium Project estimated that to meet the 2015 MDGs, the total overseas development assistance (ODA) from high-income countries would need to rise to 0.54% of gross national income (GNI). In absolute terms, the US government has contributed great amounts to ODA; however, as depicted in Fig. 2 , the relative amount contributed in 2009 was only 0.20% of US GNI, a figure less generous than the percentage contributed by most European countries, Australia, and Canada. The US government's global health program, compared with that of many other donor governments, cuts across many departments. It draws upon both the foreign-assistance structure but also the government's extensive public health capabilities. In addition to well-known actors, such as the US Agency for International Development and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, executive branch agencies with a significant involvement in global health include the departments of state, defense, agriculture, homeland security, labor, and commerce, as well as the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Peace Corps, and the Health Resources and Services Administration. These agencies carry out programs in more than 100 countries and are overseen by more than 15 congressional committees. 26 The US financial commitment to global health has dramatically increased over the last decade, especially with the implementation of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the President's Malaria Initiative (Fig. 3) . Originally authorized in 2003 at about $15 billion, PEPFAR focused on 15 countries, mostly in Africa. Over its first 5 years, PEPFAR sought to support antiretroviral treatment for 2 million people infected with HIV; prevent 7 million HIV infections; and provide care, including care for orphans and vulnerable children, for 10 million individuals. The program has been viewed as a major success for US global health policy. 27 With wide bipartisan support, PEPFAR was reauthorized in 2008 for another 5 years at $39 billion, with substantial increases in the prevention, treatment, and care targets. The legislation also authorized $4 billion for tuberculosis programming and $5 billion for malaria efforts. 28 Although PEPFAR represents a landmark US achievement in global health, it also illustrates how policy can be skewed by nonscientific factors. Fig. 4 shows that among I r e l a n d F i n l a n d U n i t e d K i n g d o m S w i t z e r l a n d S p a i n F r a n c e G e r m a n y A u s t r i a C a n a d a A u s t r a l i a N e w Z e a l a n d P o r t u g a l U n i t e d S t a t e s G r e e c e J a p a n I t a l y Health called for a rebalancing of this portfolio to better support initiatives against noncommunicable diseases, malnutrition, and injuries. 29 The signature global health program of the Obama administration, the Global Health Initiative (GHI), aims to provide $63 billion in health assistance between 2009 and 2014. Although HIV/AIDS still dominates the GHI, increased investments are being made for neglected tropical diseases, malaria, maternal and child health, and family planning (Box 3). The aims of the GHI are to implement a woman-centered and girlcentered approach; increase impact and efficiency through strategic coordination and integration; strengthen and leverage key partnerships, multilateral organizations, and private contributions; encourage country ownership and investing in country-led plans; improve metrics, monitoring, and evaluation; and promote research and innovation. 30 The US government's policy commitment to global health has been greatly lauded as a reflection of our vital health and economic self-interests, our humanitarian values, and \"smart power.\" [31] [32] [33] In many ways, it is an important form of diplomacy; however, some aspects of it may also hinder diplomatic prerogatives. Some forms of ODA can be used as leverage in diplomatic negotiations, but once a patient infected with HIV is taken into a PEPFAR-funded treatment program, it would be unethical for the US government to threaten the loss of those lifesaving drugs for diplomatic advantage. 34 ",

A decision-making partnership board with 27 members (6 ex-officio) represents the 7 broad RBM constituencies and meets periodically. There are 21 voting members of the board representing foundations (1 seat), malaria-endemic countries (8 seats), multilateral institutions (4 seats), NGOs (2 seats), Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) donor countries (3 seats), private sector (2 seats), and research and academia (1 seat).

This Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (GFATM), unlike the previously mentioned partnerships, has as its sole focus mobilizing and distributing financial resources in a manner driven by technically sound national plans and priorities and principles of transparency and accountability. The GFATM is a partnership between governments, civil society, the private sector, and affected communities. More than 40 countries have pledged funds to the GFATM; other major donors include the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, UNITAID, and Chevron. About $21 billion has been pledged, of which more than $16 billion has already been paid. 35 With funding approved for more than 500 programs in nearly 150 countries, the GFATM is the source of onequarter of all international financing for AIDS globally as well as for two-thirds of that for tuberculosis and three-quarters of that for malaria. 36 An innovative fiscal contribution to solving the crisis of antimalarial drug resistance and the dwindling number of effective drugs has been the creation of the Affordable Medicines Facility for Malaria (AMFm). Conceived by the IOM Committee on the Economics of Antimalarial Drugs, the AMFm was designed to re-engineer market forces to favor the effective treatment of resistant malaria through the appropriate use of artemisinin-containing combination antimalarial drugs (ACTs). In 2004 the committee recommended the commitment of $300 to $500 million per year to subsidize the entire global ACT market to create a steady supply of affordable and desirably priced ACTs in all malarious areas. 37 Several donors accepted this recommendation. The AMFm was established by the GFATM and initially capitalized with more than $146 million. 35 ",

            "text": "Although the greatest sources of funding, technical support, and leadership will continue to come from donor governments, recipient governments, and UN agencies, contributions from the world of philanthropy have never been more significant. Early in the twentieth century, Rockefeller philanthropy supported efforts to eliminate hookworm, first domestically and then internationally. It has since taken on many other disease-control efforts directed toward conditions, including malaria, schistosomiasis, yellow fever, and vaccine-preventable childhood infections. In 1914, it created the China Medical Board to develop modern medicine in that country but arguably its most significant contributions to advancing global health governance were investments to establish the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health as well as schools of public health at Harvard and the University of Michigan. Reflecting the emergence of the new era in global health governance, in 1998 the Rockefeller Foundation established an initiative to create innovative new public-private partnerships, including the Medicines for Malaria Venture, the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development, and the International Partnership on Microbicides. 38 Over the years, many other foundations have made important contributions to facilitating global health action, including the Ford Foundation, Atlantic Philanthropies, the Carnegie Corporation, the Bloomberg Family Foundation, the Burroughs Wellcome Trust, the Burroughs Wellcome Foundation, and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation. The most noteworthy newcomer is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. With assets of approximately $33 billion, the Gates Foundation is the largest private philanthropy in the world. Its current annual disbursements are approximately $3 billion, much of which goes to global health. Among foundations, its major commitments to GAVI (at least $1.5 billion), the Rotary International polio-eradication effort ($355 million), and the GFATM ($650 million) give it a uniquely powerful and sometimes controversial voice in global health governance. Its investments in research, implementation, and advocacy encompass enteric and diarrheal diseases; HIV/AIDS; malaria, pneumonia, tuberculosis, and neglected and other infectious diseases; family planning; nutrition; maternal, neonatal and child health; tobacco control; and vaccine-preventable diseases. Private funding now accounts for almost one-quarter of global health aid. 39 Unlike the foundations previously mentioned, the William J. Clinton Foundation is not a grant-making organization. For nearly a decade, however, it has been a unique contributor to advancing global health. By capitalizing on the influence of former President Bill Clinton, this foundation has catalyzed many initiatives. Among these initiatives have been tremendous gains in access to HIV/AIDS treatment through negotiations with suppliers of drugs and diagnostic tests. Through successive agreements, suppliers to low-income countries have reduced the prices of first-line treatments by 50%, pediatric medicines by 90%, and second-line HIV/AIDS medicines by a cumulative reduction of 30%. 40 ",

Since 1987, for example, Merck has donated ivermectin for the control of onchocerciasis (river blindness) worldwide. In 1998, in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline, this commitment was expanded to include the elimination of lymphatic filariasis; Ivermectin and GlaxoSmithKline's albendazole were coadministered in African countries and in Yemen (countries where lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis are coendemic). Over 21 years, more than 1 billion treatments for these infections have been provided though a large partnership. 41 Johnson and Johnson donates enough mebendazole each year to treat 25 million children for intestinal helminthes; Boehringer Ingelheim donates nevirapine to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Pfizer has proved to be a valuable and innovative partner with its support for capacity-building activities, such as the Pfizer Global Health Fellows program. Each year, this program deploys up to 50 talented employees to work on high-impact, capacity-building projects in developing countries. 42 Similarly, BD strengthens capacity through a partnership with PEPFAR to improve laboratory systems in countries highly affected by HIV/AIDS and TB. 43 The emerging corporate role in global health is not limited to companies focused on the business of health. Companies as diverse as ExxonMobil, Warner Brothers, and Nike have engaged in important partnerships focused on controlling malaria, HIV/ AIDS, and violence against girls. American Cyanamid has donated millions of dollars of the larvicide temephos to support guinea worm eradication efforts. Formal business coalitions have developed to take on issues of malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS. 44 The role of civil society organizations in global health predates all of those entities previously named. The WHO lists 189 NGOs with which it has an official relationship. 45 As the WHO notes:",

The involvement of civil society has profoundly affected not only the concepts underpinning public health but the formulation and implementation of public health programs and policies as well. 46 Global Health: Governance and Policy Development Civil society organizations span a wide array of secular and faith-based entities. They include groups with a disease-specific orientation; groups with a professionalspecialty focus; charities that work on the ground; and global professional service organizations, such as Rotary International. (Rotary International is a key global partner in the WHO campaign for polio eradication. 47 ) Perhaps the most exciting recent development in the United States has been the explosion in interest in global health education at universities. Suffice it to say that if governance is the constellation of mechanisms a society uses to effect collective action toward common goals, then the catalyst of the many new US multidisciplinary university programs in global health education will initiate and energize an unprecedented level of collective action. 48 ",

Perhaps today's most acute global health challenge is achieving the 3 health-related MDGs. Current trends indicate that none of these basic targets will be near achievement by 2015. Overall access to care is still lacking or suboptimal for billions of people. Access to clean water and essential medicines is uneven. Modern pharmaceuticals are often unaffordable or unavailable. Globalization has brought some health benefits to the world's poorest, but it has also fostered the transnational spread of infectious diseases, the brain drain of skilled health care workers from developing countries, and the trade in poor-quality food and pharmaceuticals. Surveillance for human and animal diseases is of variable quality and the enforcement of the relevant regulatory regimes needs improvement. Despite the challenges that remain in coordinating the many diverse players now engaged in global health, the vast increase in the commitment of both private and public wealth over the last decade is to be celebrated. Commitments have gone far beyond money and have brought forth legions of individuals who choose to commit themselves in the global context to the universal value of health. Research is steadily discovering and developing new technological interventions. New mechanisms of cooperation have been developed, and there is a growing interest in implementation science and in program evaluation to increase accountability and effectiveness. Improved global health governance to better catalyze and coordinate collective action remains an essential underpinning to meeting the diverse challenges to saving lives in all parts of the globe.",
