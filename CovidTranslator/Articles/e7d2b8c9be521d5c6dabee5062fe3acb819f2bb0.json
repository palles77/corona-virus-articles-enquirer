An effective way to control IBDV would be to breed chickens with a reduced susceptibility to IBDV infection. In the present work, we used chickens selected for high and low specific responses to sheep red blood cells (SRBC) (H and L, respectively) to assess the susceptibility of differential immune competent animals to IBDV infection. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of high SRBC line (HL) and low SRBC line (LL) were infected with IBDV and viral RNA loads were determined at different time post-IBDV infection. Chicken orthologues of the T helper 1 (Th1) cytokines, interferon-c (IFN-c) and interleukin-2 (IL-2); a Th2 cytokine, IL-10; a pro inflammatory cytokine, IL-6; the CCL chemokines, chCCLi2, chCCLi4 and chCCLi7; colony stimulating factor, GM-CSF; and a anti-inflammatory cytokine, transforming growth factor b-2 (TGFb-2) were quantified. The expression of chCCLi2, chCCLi4 and chCCLi7 was significantly higher in L line as compared to H line. However, in H line the viral RNA loads were significantly lower than in L line. Therefore, the upregulated chemokines might be associated with the susceptibility to IBDV. The expression of IFN-c, IL-2 and IL-6 was significantly higher in H line as compared to L line. We assume that the higher proinflammatory cytokines expression in H line might be related to the rapid clearance of virus from PBMCs. Significantly higher levels of IL-10 and TGFb-2 mRNAs in L line might be related to the pathogenesis of IBDV. In conclusion, selection for antibody responses appears to influence the expression profiles of chemokines and cytokines against IBDV. Further, the selection for high SRBC response might improve the immuno-competence of chickens against IBDV.",

As a result, India ranks fourth largest producer of poultry eggs and fifth largest producer of poultry meat in the world. Worldwide poultry is producing 40% of consumed animal products. However, diseases are one of the major threats inflicting great economic losses to poultry industry. It is therefore important that poultry production and products processing should be free from pathogenic organisms. Infectious bursal disease (IBD) (Gumboro disease) has constituted a serious problem for the poultry industry. It is an acute and highly contagious viral disease of young chicken, caused by infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) (Muller et al., 1979) . IBDV is a nonenveloped, double stranded RNA virus that has bi-segmented genome, segment A (3.2 kb) and B (2.9 kb), encoding five proteins and belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus of family Birnaviridae, which specifically targets dividing IgM-bearing B cells, especially those in the bursa of Fabricius and other immune organs (Hirai et al., 1981; Rodenberg et al., 1994) . Two serotypes of IBDV have been identified but only strains of serotype 1 are pathogenic for chickens (McFerran et al., 1980; Lukert and Saif, 1997) . Based on virulence, serotype 1 strains are classified as classical, intermediate, virulent and very or hyper virulent (van den Berg et al., 2000) .",

The indirect economic impact of the disease is also considerable, due to virus-induced immunosuppression and/or potential interactions between IBDV and other viruses, bacteria or parasites (Balamurugan and Kataria, 2006) . These indirect losses are due to secondary infections, growth retardation and poor immune response to vaccines (Kibenge et al., 1988) . Moreover, the increased use of antibiotics against secondary infections constitutes a growing public health concern (Eldaghayes et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "Exploitation of available chicken genetic resistance to pathogens has been adjudged as best strategy for the control and prevention of disease. Many studies on infectious diseases in birds provided evidence for genetic differences in susceptibility (Fadly and Witter, 1986; Girard-Santosuosso et al., 1998; Ignjatovic et al., 2003) . Comparisons between inbred lines of chickens show large differences in susceptibility of different genotypes to IBD. Some lines show little or no mortality and limited damage to bursal lymphocytes, while the BrL (Brown Leghorn) line in particular showed high levels of mortality and extreme destruction of the bursa which suggested that resistance might be due to a very small number of genes (Bumstead et al., 1993) but not major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (Hudson et al., 2002) . Furthermore, transcriptional profiling of genetically resistant and sensitive birds against IBD revealed that a more rapid inflammatory response and more-extensive p53-related induction of apoptosis in the target B cells might limit viral replication and consequent pathology in resistant birds (Ruby et al., 2006) . Divergent selection based on high and low antibody response against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs) (nonpathogenic antigen) is an immuno-competent trait (Yunis et al., 2002) , which is considered an indicator of humoral immune response or B cell response. It has been reported that divergent selection for sheep RBC (SRBC) affects humoral immune response to IBD (Parmentier et al., 1996) . However, further information is lacking on the effect of genetic selection for SRBC responses on susceptibility/resistance to IBD infection. Recent studies suggested that cytokines play a major role in differential immune responses to various antigens in chicken lines divergently selected for either high (H) or low (L) SRBC antibody responses (Hangalapura et al., 2006) . Moreover, cytokines are identified as key molecules involved in the susceptibility or resistance to various pathogens like Salmonella enteritidis and Enterococcus gallinarum (Swaggerty et al., 2004 (Swaggerty et al., , 2006 Kaiser et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2012) .",

Six elite crosses available in the country and pure dam line (IR-3) were used for developing the base population of SDL. These SDL broiler birds were maintained at experimental broiler farm of CARI, Izatnagar, Bareilly, India, were divergently selected for response to SRBC and individuals of F4 generation were utilized in present study. For divergent selection, antibody response to SRBC was measured by Haemagglutination (HA) test at day 5 post i.v. administration of SRBC suspension in 4-5 weeks old birds (Siegal and Gross, 1980; Saxena et al., 1997) . High responding males and females were used in full sib mating plan for generation of H line and similarly low responding males and females were used to produce L line in each generation. In the present study, 5 weeks old, ten extreme responder birds each from the H and L line, with an average SRBC agglutination titer of 15.2 and 1.35, respectively, were used. All the birds were reared on deep litter system in brooder houses with temperature maintained at 25-27\u00b0C and atmospheric relative humidity as 60 \u00b1 5% with free access to feed and water. The birds were vaccinated against Newcastle disease, Marek's disease and infectious bronchitis, except infectious bursal disease as per standard protocols. All the birds used in this study were five week old and negative for serum IBDV antibodies as tested by ELISA test using IDEXX-ELISA kit ((FlockCheck\u2044) procured from M/s IDEXX Laboratories.",

The 3 0 and 5 0 gene specific primer pairs (Table 1) were designed from the published reports (Sundaresan et al., 2007 ). An initial validation experiment was conducted to confirm the specificity of primers (data not shown). b-Actin gene was used as a internal control as it was reported to express at constant amounts during IBDV infection (Li et al., 2005) . All PCR reactions were performed in optical 96-well reaction plates, in duplicates. The amplification was carried out in 25 ll volume containing 1X QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR master mix (SYBR Green 1 dye, ROX passive reference dye, HotStarTaq DNA polymerase and dNTPs with dUTP in optimized buffer components; QIAGEN GmBH, Germany), at 0.2 lM concentration of each gene-specific primer, and 1 ll of cDNA template. PCR cycling conditions were: initial denaturation of 95\u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation 95\u00b0C for 30 s; annealing (Table 1) for 30 s and extension 72\u00b0C; 45 s. For each gene of interest, negative and positive controls were included. Recombinant plasmids with insert of chemokines or cytokines were used as a positive control. Negative controls were those samples in which cDNA were not added. For each sample a dissociation curve was generated after completion of amplification and analyzed in comparison to negative and positive controls, to determine the specificity of PCR reaction. Moreover, few amplicons were sequenced to confirm the specificity of primers. Results are expressed in terms of the threshold cycle value (Ct), the cycle at which the change in the reporter dye (DRn) passes the significance threshold. To generate gene-specific standard curves, plasmids containing each of the chemokine or cytokine genes were serially diluted from 10 \u00c01 to 10 \u00c05 . To generate standard curve for b-actin, pooled cDNA sample was serially diluted and used. Each RT-PCR experiment contained triplicates of test samples, one no-template-control, and a log10 dilution series. Regression analysis of the standard curve was used to calculate the slopes of the gene specific log10 dilution series.",

Maximum viral load was observed at 6 h post IBDV challenge in both H and L lines. After peaking viral load was decreased significantly in both the lines but a rapid clearance of virus was observed in H line after 12 h whereas in L line viral load was detected up to 48 h. (Sharma et al., 2000) . Previous studies have indicated that IBDV pathogenesis may vary with the genetic background of the chicken (Ruby et al., 2006; Aricibasi et al., 2010) . IBDV induces a strong pro-inflammatory response in bursal macrophages, evidenced by increased mRNA transcription of IL-1, IL-6, IL-18, IFN-c and CXCLi2, and down-regulation of TGF-b (Palmquist et al., 2006; Eldaghayes et al., 2006; Rauw et al., 2007) . However, little is known about the immune responses induced by IBDV in PBMCs and alteration of immune responses The dose of the virus used for in vitro challenge was selected based on the initial experiments (data not shown). We found 0.1 moi virus was suitable for the in vitro challenge experiments.",

Cytokines and chemokines are an integral part of the host immune response in avian species (Eckmann and Kagnoff, 2001) . Resistance or susceptibility to most infectious diseases is strongly determined by the balance of cytokines and chemokines produced during infection (van Den Broek et al., 2000) . Chemokines are important in the recruitment of immune cells to the site of infection (Hong et al., 2006) . In the present study, chicken CC chemokines chCCLi2, chCCLi4 and chCCLi7 were upregulated in PBMCs following IBDV infection. In earlier studies, chCXCLi2 was found to be upregulated post IBDV infection (Eldaghayes et al., 2006) . This is the first report suggesting the upregulation of CCL chemokines following IBDV infection in chicken. Here, the expressions of chCCLi2, chCCLi4 and chCCLi7 were significantly higher in L line when compared to H line. However, the viral RNA loads were significantly lower in H line as compared to L line. Earlier studies in S. enteritidis-resistant chickens suggested that a higher level of chemokine mRNA expression is related to the Salmonella resistance (Swaggerty et al., 2006) . However, recent studies in mice suggested that higher expression of chemokines associated with the disease susceptibility (Yun et al., 2005; Sun et al., 2006) . Therefore, we presume that the upregulated chemokines might be associated with the susceptibility to IBDV.",

The expression of IFN-c was compared in two inbred lines of chickens differing in resistant to the S. enterica serover Enteritidis and it was found that significantly low expression of IFN-c was observed in susceptible birds in comparison to resistant ones (Sadeyen et al., 2004) . Furthermore, the local production of IL-2 during Eimeria infection contribute to local proliferation of effector T-cells, including T-cells which are involved in cytotoxic effector mechanisms for the control of infection (Lillehoj, 1989; Hong et al., 2006) .

Functionally, chicken GM-CSF was shown to inhibit the synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines (including IL-1, TNF-a, and IL-12), thus down-regulating inflammatory (Th1) responses (de Waal Malefyt et al., 1991; Groux and Powrie, 1999; Hong et al., 2006) . Here, the expression of GM-CSF mRNA was upregulated initially and down regulated at later stages in both H and L lines. Similarly during Eimeria infection in chicken, the early upregulation of GM-CSF mRNA was observed (Hong et al., 2006) . However, there is no report of virus induced suppression of GM-CSF in chicken. In feline coronavirus infection, significantly lower levels of GM-CSF were observed in mesenteric lymph nodes (Kipar et al., 2006) . Further, mice challenged with Mycobacterium tuberculosis expressed lower GM-CSF (Ordway et al., 2006) . In The present study, the down regulation of GM-CSF was significantly higher in H line when compared to L line. Therefore, the findings of the study suggest that down regulation of GM-CSF might be a part of viral pathogenesis and we hypothesize that the lower proinflammatory cytokines expression in L line might be due to the comparatively higher levels of GM-CSF.",

In chicken, infection with Infectious bursal disease virus strains causes down-regulation of TGF-b4 in bursa (Eldaghayes et al., 2006) . However, in the present study, the upregulation of TGF-b2 was observed in PBMCs of chicken. These findings suggest that TGF-b2 might be upregulated to control the inflammation mediated by Th1 cytokines and this upregulation might be the reason for the lower expression of Th1 cytokines in L line. In the present study, the upregulation of TGF-b2 was significantly higher in L line when compared to H line at initial intervals. In human epithelial cells, treatment of TGF-b increased respiratory syncytial virus replication (McCann and Imani, 2007) . Therefore, the higher expression of TGF-b2 might be related to the IBDV pathogenesis in chicken and H line might be resistant to IBDV as low level expression of TGF-b2 was observed.",

Moreover, the rapid clearance of IBDV from PBMCs in H line might be due to the enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, selection for high antibody responses to SRBC might improve the immuno-competence of chickens against IBDV. . As values are subtracted from negative end point, higher values represent higher levels of VP2 mRNA levels. The result represents the mean \u00b1 SE of three independent experiment from one pooled PBMCs of 10 birds per line at each time interval.

The advantages of using PBMCs are (i) PBMCs are easily accessible immune cells and (ii) PBMCs can be harvested from breeder birds without sacrifice(Sundaresan et al., 2005;Hangalapura et al., 2006).
