We generated a HPIV2 virus (rHPIV2-V ko ) in which the P/V gene encodes only the P protein to examine the role of V in replication in vivo and as a potential live attenuated virus vaccine. Preventing expression of V protein severely impaired virus recovery from cDNA and growth in vitro, particularly in IFN-competent cells. rHPIV2-V ko , unlike WT HPIV2, strongly induced IFN-\u03b2 and permitted IFN signaling, leading to establishment of a robust antiviral state. rHPIV2-V ko infection induced extensive syncytia and cytopathicity that was due to both apoptosis and necrosis. Replication of rHPIV2-V ko was highly restricted in the respiratory tract of African green monkeys and in differentiated primary human airway epithelial (HAE) cultures, suggesting that V protein is essential for efficient replication of HPIV2 in organized epithelial cells and that rHPIV2-V ko is over-attenuated for use as a live attenuated vaccine.",

It encodes 7 polypeptides from 6 genes arranged in the order 3\u2032-N-P/V-M-F-HN-L-5\u2032. The HPIV2 genome is 15,654 nucleotides in length and requires a genome nucleotide length that is a multiple of six for efficient replication (known as the \"rule of six\") (Skiadopoulos et al., 2003) . Transcription and replication are directed by the viral nucleocapsid protein (N), the phosphoprotein (P), and the large polymerase (L) protein (Karron and Collins, 2007) . The fusion (F) and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoproteins are the major protective antigens for the HPIVs and are associated with the viral envelope, along with the internal matrix protein (M) (Murphy, 1988) . The remaining polypeptide, the accessory V protein, has been identified as an antagonist of the type I interferon (IFN) response (Andrejeva et al., 2004; He et al., 2002; Horvath, 2004; Poole et al., 2002; Young et al., 2000) .",

Unedited transcription of the P/V gene yields an mRNA that codes for the V protein. Alternatively, the co-transcriptional insertion of two non-templated guanine nucleotides by RNA editing generates an mRNA with a frame shift that codes for the P protein. Therefore, P and V proteins share the first 164 N-terminal amino acids but have distinct C-termini. RNA editing to insert pseudotemplated G nucleotides is a conserved viral mechanism that occurs in nearly all members of the five genera in subfamily Paramyxovirinae (Karron and Collins, 2007) .",

The latter function may be mediated through binding of the V protein to the virus N and L proteins as well as to RNA (Lin, Paterson, and Lamb, 1997; Nishio et al., 2008; Nishio et al., 2007; Nishio et al., 2006; Randall and Bermingham, 1996) . In addition to these functions, the V proteins of rubulaviruses are components of the virions, whereas V has not been detected in the virions of respiroviruses or morbilliviruses (Curran et al., 1991; Paterson et al., 1995) . A role for V in virion morphogenesis has been suggested but remains to be defined in detail .",

RNA virus infection is detected by a number of host cell pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that induce innate immune responses such as the IFN and apoptotic responses. Toll-like receptors, which are expressed on the cell surface and in endosomes, recognize specific viral products such as viral nucleic acids present in intracellular vesicles or in the extracellular environment, whereas retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) are constitutively expressed RNA helicases that detect viral RNAs in the cytosol. Activation of either type of PRR signals both IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 synthesis and subsequent IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling through its receptor (Koyama et al., 2007; Yoneyama and Fujita, 2007; Yoneyama et al., 2004) . IFNs are secreted from most cells and can act in either an autocrine or paracrine manner. The effects of IFN on the host cell are initiated by engagement and multimerization of the IFN-\u03b1-receptor (IFNAR) by IFN-\u03b1 or IFN\u03b2. The IFNAR-associated tyrosine kinases, Tyk2 and Jak1, phosphorylate IFNAR1 and 2 receptor subunits, thereby triggering recruitment, phosphorylation and release of STAT1 and STAT2 from the receptor into the cytoplasm. Activated STAT1 and STAT2 associate with IRF9 to form a complex known as interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), which translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of IFN-inducible genes (ISGs). The ISGs establish an antiviral state in both infected and uninfected cells and also serve to augment the adaptive immune response (Fensterl and Sen, 2009 ).",

The multifunctional V protein of HPIV2 has been shown to counteract the IFN response at two steps: limiting induction of IFN biosynthesis by viral dsRNA through an interaction with the RNA helicase MDA5 (Andrejeva et al., 2004; Childs et al., 2007) and blocking IFN signaling by engaging STAT1 and STAT2 proteins in a cytoplasmic complex with a cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase, resulting in ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of STAT2 (Andrejeva et al., 2002; Nishio et al., 2002; Nishio et al., 2005) . These data suggest that mutation or ablation of HPIV2 V protein could be used as a strategy to generate a live attenuated HPIV2 vaccine candidate. However, as potential complications, abrogation of the IFNindependent function of V on polymerase activity and replication by mutation could result in a reduction in the yield of live vaccine in cell culture during manufacture or in over-attenuation of the vaccine in vivo.",

Both mutants were highly restricted for replication in a number of cell lines, including in Vero cells, which cannot produce type I IFNs Nishio et al., 2005) . However, the efficiency of growth of these two V mutants in vivo was not reported, and the full genome sequence was not presented. In the present study, we used a rule-of-six-compliant recovery system to generate an independent recombinant HPIV2 (rHPIV2-V ko ) in which V expression was ablated by the introduction of alterations in the RNA editing site of the P/V gene, similar to the HPIV2 mutant generated by Nishio and colleagues (Nishio et al., 2005) . Sequence analysis of recovered rHPIV2-V ko virus confirmed that it had a wild-type sequence in all expressed proteins (Skiadopoulos et al., 2003) and that rHPIV2-V ko contained only one incidental mutation in a non-coding region judged to be biologically insignificant. This study extends the previous observations by examining the ability of rHPIV2-V ko to induce the synthesis of IFN, to inhibit IFN signaling through its receptor, to replicate in vivo in non-human primates, and to replicate in human well-differentiated primary airway epithelial cells in culture. rHPIV2-V ko was found to be restricted for growth in vitro due to enhanced cytopathic effect (CPE) and an inability to antagonize both the induction of IFN and IFN signaling through its receptor. These defects proved to be highly restrictive for growth in African green monkeys (AGMs) and in cultures of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE).",

HPIV2 and other paramyxoviruses use a unique mechanism of mRNA editing to insert pseudotemplated G residues during transcription of the P gene. Upon reading a specific editing site (depicted in Fig. 1A) , the viral polymerase occasionally \"stutters,\" slippage of the nascent mRNA occurs, and one or more extra G nucleotides is added. In P genes from genus Respiro-, Avula-, Henipa-and Morbillivirus, the unedited mRNA encodes P, while insertion of one G residue produces V mRNA. The opposite occurs in the Rubulaviruses, where the unedited mRNA encodes V and the edited version encodes P via a two-nucleotide frame shift (Fig. 1A) . Other groups have previously demonstrated that it is possible to prevent HPIV2 V protein expression by mutating the RNA editing site in the P/V gene Nishio et al., 2005) . Using our reverse genetics system that is based on the sequence of a low passage HPIV2 clinical isolate that replicates to high titer in non-human primates (Nolan et al., 2007) , we altered the P/V editing site to create the two-nucleotide frame shift, so that the unedited mRNA encodes only P, and disrupted the string of G nucleotides by substitution mutagenesis in order to inactivate editing (Fig. 1B) .

One of the five recovered rHPIV2-V ko populations had an editing site that was restored exactly to that of the WT virus, though other introduced sequence changes (e.g., restriction sites) were present in the sequence of the recovered virus (Table 1 , mutant 5). Another mutant (Table 1, mutant 4) had an editing site that was restored to that of the WT virus except that it was three G residues longer; thus, its P editing site had gained a single nucleotide in length compared with the original V ko mutant sequence, and this gain appeared to be compensated for by a single-nucleotide deletion in the poly(A) tract at the end of the N gene-end signal (Table 1 , mutant 4). A third mutant had ten T to C mutations between the open reading frames of N and P that highly impaired its growth in vitro (Table 1 , mutant 3). The final two recovered rHPIV2-V ko isolates had P editing sites that retained all of the mutations of the original V ko mutant, although both contained a single, different nucleotide substitution in the gene-end signal of the N gene (Table 1 , mutants 1 and 2). Mutant 2 contained a T to A substitution at nucleotide (nt) 1912 in the N gene-end signal, whose phenotypic consequences were not investigated. The N gene-end region was a site of adventitious mutations in 4 of the 5 recovered rHPIV2-V ko isolates and is therefore included in Table 1 . Mutant 1 contained an A to G substitution at nucleotide 1917, which changed the length of the poly(A) tract in the gene-end signal from 7 to 6 residues. Mutations or natural variation affecting the length of the poly(A) sequence of the gene-end signal are common for paramyxoviruses in general and usually are without phenotypic consequences (Collins and Crowe, 2007; Kolakofsky et al., 1998; Rassa et al., 2000) , and therefore mutant 1 was analyzed further. Western blot analysis revealed that expression of the gene downstream of the geneend mutation, encoding P protein, is at least equivalent to expression of P in rHPIV2-WT infected cells (Fig. 1C ). At 24, 48, and 72 h post-infection (hpi), both HPIV2 N and P proteins were expressed efficiently by rHPIV2-V ko (Fig. 1C) , indicating that the mutation in the geneend sequence of rHPIV2-V ko does not functionally impair mRNA synthesis and can be considered an incidental mutation of little biological significance. rHPIV2-V ko replicated efficiently in vitro, and sequence analysis of its entire genome showed that it was free of any additional adventitious mutations. Western blot analysis of infected LLC-MK2 cell lysates using antibodies directed against both the N-and C-termini of the HPIV2 V protein confirmed that rHPIV2-V ko did not express the V protein (Fig. 1C ). In addition, smaller bands were not detected in either rHPIV2-WT or rHPIV2-V ko with antibodies specific to the N-terminus of P/V, while V and P were readily detected, indicating that neither virus expresses a W protein and that the alterations in the editing site prevent expression of C-terminally truncated V or W proteins. Therefore, this isolate was used throughout the remainder of the study as rHPIV2-V ko .",

In A549 cells, a human type II pneumocyte cell line, rHPIV2-V ko replicated poorly and reached a peak titer of 3.0 log 10 TCID 50 /ml following high MOI inoculation, 100-fold lower than the peak titer of rHPIV2-WT (peak titer 5.0 log 10 TCID 50 /ml). Similarly, rHPIV2-V ko reached a peak titer of 3.6 log 10 TCID 50 /ml following low MOI inoculation, 630-fold lower than the peak titer of rHPIV2-WT (peak titer 6.4 log 10 TCID 50 /ml). Furthermore, titers of rHPIV2-V ko reached a plateau after 2 days post-infection (p.i.), while titers of rHPIV2-WT increased through day 8 p.i. Replication of rHPIV2-V ko was also evaluated in two monkey cell lines (Fig. 2, A and B ). African green monkey Vero cells were selected because they are unable to produce type I interferon (IFN) and because they would be the substrate used to manufacture a live attenuated HPIV2 vaccine. IFN-competent LLC-MK2 rhesus monkey kidney cells were chosen because rHPIV2-WT replicates efficiently in this cell line. rHPIV2-V ko replication was only slightly restricted following high MOI inoculation but was significantly restricted in both Vero and LLC-MK2 cells compared with rHPIV2-WT following low MOI inoculation (p<0.001, twoway ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests). In multi-cycle growth curves, replication of rHPIV2-V ko was restricted 50-fold in Vero cells (peak titer 6.4 log 10 TCID 50 /ml) and 2500-fold in LLC-MK2 cells (peak titer 5.4 log 10 TCID 50 /ml) compared with rHPIV2-WT (peak titer 8.1 log 10 TCID 50 /ml in Vero cells and 8.8 log 10 TCID 50 /ml in LLC-MK2 cells). Sequence analysis of rHPIV2-V ko isolated from cell cultures after completion of the growth curves confirmed that the mutations introduced into the P/V editing site remained intact. These data indicate that growth of rHPIV2-V ko is significantly restricted in vitro, although to a lesser extent in the absence of a cellular IFN response. The sensitivity of replication of rHPIV2-V ko to elevated temperatures (37-40\u00b0C) was also evaluated in vitro to determine whether the V deletion altered the stability of the replication complex. Replication at 37-39\u00b0C was comparable to that at 32\u00b0C but was restricted >100-fold at 40\u00b0C (data not shown), indicating a temperature sensitivity of replication at or above 40\u00b0C.",

Following incubation for 10 days, plaques were visualized by immunostaining with HPIV2specific antibodies, and plaque sizes were compared between rHPIV2-WT and rHPIV2-V ko . In Vero cells, rHPIV2-V ko plaques were approximately 37% smaller than rHPIV2-WT plaques (2.4 \u00b1 0.2 pixels for rHPIV2-V ko versus 3.8 \u00b1 0.2 for rHPIV2-WT, p<0.001). In LLC-MK2 cells, a more dramatic reduction (94%) in the plaque size of rHPIV2-V ko was observed compared with rHPIV2-WT (0.8 \u00b1 0.1 versus 13.5 \u00b1 1.0, p<0.001). Thus, rHPIV2-V ko exhibits a small plaque phenotype that is particularly pronounced in IFN-competent LLC-MK2 cells, but also is apparent to a lesser extent in IFN-lacking Vero cells. Plaque size was not assessed in A549 cells due to the overall poor multi-cycle replication of rHPIV2-V ko in this cell line.",

Since the V proteins of PIVs have been reported to inhibit apoptosis (Sun et al., 2004; Wansley and Parks, 2002) and since the CPE induced looked similar to that observed for rHPIV1-P(C-), we next explored whether the CPE induced by rHPIV2-V ko might also be due to apoptosis. In these experiments, we used the HPIV1 viruses as positive (rHPIV1-P(C-)) or negative (WT HPIV1) controls for apoptosis. We determined the frequency of apoptosis in infected cells using flow cytometry to detect activated caspase-3, the major effector caspase in the apoptotic pathway. Replicate cultures of LLC-MK2 cells were infected with rHPIV2-WT, rHPIV2-V ko , or the HPIV1 control viruses at a MOI of 5.0 TCID 50 /cell and were fixed at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. Cells were then permeabilized and immunostained for activated caspase-3. As described previously, rHPIV1-P(C-) was a potent inducer of caspase-3 activation while rHPIV1-WT was not (Fig. 3B) . Specifically, in cultures infected with rHPIV1-WT, less than 1.2% of the cells expressed activated caspase-3 through 72 hpi, which was similar to mockinfected cultures (approximately 0.5% positive for activated caspase-3). In contrast, in cultures infected with the rHPIV1-P(C-) positive control, greater than 50% of the cells at 48 and 72 hpi expressed activated caspase-3, indicative of cells undergoing apoptosis. rHPIV2-WT caused slightly more apoptosis than rHPIV1-WT, with 7.1% of cells expressing activated caspase-3 at 72 hpi (p<0.001). Unexpectedly, in rHPIV2-V ko -infected cultures, there was only a small (2-fold) increase in activated caspase-3-positive cells (14.2% at 72 hpi) compared to rHPIV2-WT. While this increase was statistically significant (p<0.001), we had expected a substantially larger increase given the extent of cell destruction that was evident from light microscopic evaluation (Fig. 3A ). Extensive cell destruction also was evident from the decrease in the forward scatter parameter for events measured by FACS analysis of rHPIV2-V ko -infected cultures ( Fig. 3B) , which indicates reduced cell size and accumulation of cell debris. These results suggested that the majority of cells infected with rHPIV2-V ko were not dying through an apoptotic pathway.",

One ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is rapidly released into culture medium only upon damage to the plasma membrane is lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); therefore, measuring activity of LDH released into the culture media allows rapid quantification of cells whose plasma membrane has been damaged by cytotoxic effect. An increase in the level of LDH activity in the culture media is proportional to the number of dead or damaged cells in the culture. When we measured LDH release from LLC-MK2 cells at 24, 48, and 72 hpi, we found that rHPIV2-V ko induced approximately 40% more LDH release at 72 hpi than rHPIV2-WT or, surprisingly, rHPIV1-P (C-) (Fig. 3D ). We conclude from these data that rHPIV2-V ko exhibits a marked increase in its ability to induce cell-cell fusion and cytopathicity compared to rHPIV2-WT. However, unlike rHPIV1-P(C-), rHPIV2-V ko appears to cause CPE primarily through syncytia formation and necrosis rather than through the induction of apoptosis, although both processes are active during infection with rHPIV2-V ko .",

To quantify expression of F and HN on the plasma membrane, we stained live adherent LLC-MK2 cells for cell surface expression of HPIV2 F and HN and estimated the level of expression by FACS analysis. We chose this method because it would allow us to compare the relative amount of F and HN glycoprotein incorporated into the infected cell membranes without involuntarily analyzing intracellular F and HN. Using this technique, no significant difference in mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was detected for F at 24 hpi (MFI of 60.3 for rHPIV2-WT vs. 51.4 for rHPIV2-V ko ) or 48 hpi (MFI of 87.0 for rHPIV2-WT vs. 80.1 for rHPIV2-V ko ). Similarly, the MFI for HN protein was comparable between cells infected with either of the two viruses at both 24 hpi (MFI of 357 for rHPIV2-WT vs. 338 for rHPIV2-V ko ) and 48 hpi (MFI of 363 for rHPIV2-WT vs. 405 for rHPIV2-V ko ). Since we were unable to detect a difference in cell surface glycoprotein expression, we conclude that factors in addition to the level of F and HN expression likely play a major role in syncytia formation. However, these data and interpretations are offered with the caveat that infection with rHPIV2-V ko is a dynamic process where some cells form syncytia and others detach or die, adding uncertainly into the interpretation of the F and HN expression data.",

LLC-MK2 cells were infected at a MOI of 5.0 TCID 50 /cell with rHPIV2-WT or rHPIV2-V ko , and the concentration of IFN-\u03b2 in the culture supernatant was determined by an ELISA that detects active IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 4A) .

In contrast, cells infected with rHPIV2-V ko showed markedly increased IFN-\u03b2 production by 72 hpi (20-fold over rHPIV2-WT). Similar results were found using a type I IFN bioassay based on the inhibition of plaque formation by VSV-GFP (data not shown). Unlike rHPIV2-WT, rHPIV2-V ko appears to be unable to inhibit the production of IFN-\u03b2 by infected cells.",

To evaluate the dimerization of IRF-3 in response to HPIV2 infection, LLC-MK2 cells were infected with rHPIV2-WT or rHPIV2-V ko at a MOI of 5.0 TCID 50 /cell, and dimerization assays were performed at 24 and 48 hpi. rHPIV2-WT inhibited IRF-3 dimerization, whereas rHPIV2-V ko induced IRF-3 dimerization (Fig. 4B ).

Therefore, we determined the effect of deleting the V protein on the ability of HPIV2 to block type I IFN signaling using a biological assay that assesses the establishment of an antiviral state in rHPIV2-infected cells. Vero cells, which do not produce type I IFN, were mock infected or infected with rHPIV2s at a MOI of 5.0 TCID 50 /cell for 24 h prior to treatment with IFN-\u03b2. Twenty-four hours after IFN-\u03b2 treatment, cells were infected with vesicular stomatitis virus expressing green fluorescent protein (VSV-GFP). The number of VSV-GFP plaques was counted 48 h later, and the percent inhibition of plaque formation due to IFN-\u03b2 treatment was calculated relative to cells that were not treated with IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 4C ). In cells that were not infected with HPIV2 (Mock), VSV-GFP replication was inhibited 80% by IFN\u03b2 treatment (100 or 1000 IU/mL). The average size (area) of the remaining plaques was reduced approximately 6-fold in IFN-treated wells compared with the size of plaques in untreated wells. In contrast, infection with rHPIV2-WT reduced the inhibitory effect of IFN-\u03b2 by 75%, i.e. to a level of 20%, indicating that rHPIV2-WT can prevent IFN-\u03b2 signaling and thereby blunt the induction of an antiviral state. Infection with rHPIV2-V ko was unable to inhibit the antiviral effect of IFN-\u03b2 resulting in 80% inhibition of VSV-GFP plaque formation in IFN-\u03b2 treated cells, identical to that in the mock-infected cultures. The plaque formation by VSV-GFP in cells infected with rHPIV2-V ko , even in the absence of IFN treatment, was inhibited 70% (data not shown), for reasons that are undefined but likely involve the enhanced CPE observed with this virus. Thus, the magnitude of IFN-mediated inhibition associated with this mutant was calculated based on the reduced number of VSV-GFP plaques that form on rHPIV2-V koinfected monolayers in the absence of added IFN-\u03b2.",

By 24 hpi, rHPIV2-WT had completely degraded STAT2 in the infected cells and continued to prevent accumulation of STAT2 through 48 hpi. rHPIV2-V ko -infected cells, however, expressed levels of STAT2 that were as high or higher than in mock-infected cells through 48 hpi. Although STAT2 was degraded by rHPIV2-WT and not by rHPIV2-V ko , all infected cell lysates expressed equivalent amounts of STAT1. We also observed that STAT1 could still be phosphorylated in response to IFN-\u03b2 when we stimulated cells infected with either rHPIV2-WT or rHPIV2-V ko prior to lysis and performed immunoblots using antibodies specific to the phosphorylated form of STAT1 (data not shown). Therefore, rHPIV2-V ko appears to be unable to degrade STAT2, eliminating its ability to block type I IFN signaling, whereas neither rHPIV2-V ko nor rHPIV2-WT appeared to affect STAT1 stability or phosphorylation.",

However, rHPIV2-V ko was undetectable in all of the AGM respiratory tract samples. The lower limit of detection was 0.5 log 10 TCID 50 /ml. Likely as a result of its poor replication, rHPIV2-V ko was also poorly immunogenic. While infection of rHPIV2-WT caused a 4.2-fold rise in HPIV2 neutralizing antibody titer in AGMs between day 0 and day 28 p.i., there was no significant rise in response to rHPIV2-V ko (1.5-fold).

In vitro models of the human airway epithelium (HAE) can be derived from primary human airway cells grown at an airliquid interface where they differentiate into a multilayered, polarized epithelium. Unlike transformed monolayer cell lines, these primary polarized epithelial cultures closely mimic morphological and physiological characteristics of the human airway epithelium in vivo, including mucus production and ciliary motion Pickles et al., 1998 ). The HAE model has been used to investigate characteristics of infection for a number of respiratory viruses, including human coronaviruses, influenza A virus, RSV, HPIV1 and HPIV3 (Bartlett et al., 2008b; Leonard et al., 2008; Sims et al., 2005; Thompson et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2002) . In the present study, we found that, following apical inoculation of HAE cells with a MOI of 0.01 TCID 50 /cell, rHPIV2-WT replicated efficiently, reaching a peak titer of 10 4 TCID 50 /ml (Fig. 5B) . However, as in the AGM samples, rHPIV2-V ko was undetectable in the HAE culture supernatant through day 7 p.i. and appears to be unable to infect HAE productively (Fig. 5B) . To determine whether a high level of IFN production limited the growth of rHPIV2-V ko in HAE cultures, we measured the concentration of IFN-\u03b2 secretion by ELISA (Fig. 5C) . A low level of IFN-\u03b2 was detected in response to rHPIV2-WT infection of HAE (peak of 94 pg/ml on day 4 p.i.). In contrast, cells infected with rHPIV2-V ko showed very little secretion of IFN-\u03b2 (<20 pg/ml), most likely due to the virus's severely restricted replication.",

            "text": "Evaluation of mutants of the Toshiba strain of HPIV2, either containing a deletion of the Vspecific cysteine-rich domain, designated as rPIV2V(\u2212) , or encoding an alteration of the P editing site that results in ablation of V expression, designated as rPIV2/Pedit (Nishio et al., 2005) , indicated that HPIV2 V was required for efficient replication, particularly in IFN-competent cells. We sought to prepare and further characterize an independent V ko HPIV2 to examine the effect of the deletion on the synthesis and signaling of IFN, on cytopathology, and on replication both in vitro and in vivo. To this end, rHPIV2-V ko was generated using a low passage HPIV2 isolate that replicates efficiently in AGMs and that was completely sequenced to confirm its sequence comparability to the WT virus from which it was derived. Since deletion of IFN antagonists such as the NS1/NS2 proteins of influenza virus (Ferko et al., 2004; Hai et al., 2008; Talon et al., 2000) and respiratory syncytial virus (Teng et al., 2000; Whitehead et al., 1999; Wright et al., 2006) can attenuate viruses in vivo and have potential for use as live attenuated virus vaccines, we were particularly interested to see if rHPIV2-V ko had properties suitable for such a vaccine. rHPIV2-V ko was impaired in replication in vitro, as indicated both by a low frequency of recovery of infectious virus from cDNA and by a considerable restriction of replication in vitro, particularly in IFN-competent LLC-MK2 and A549 cells. rHPIV2-V ko replication in Vero cells, a cell line unable to produce type I IFN (Emeny and Morgan, 1979; Mosca and Pitha, 1986; Wathelet, Berr, and Huez, 1992) and also low in constitutive expression of IRF3 (Chew et al., 2009) , was 10-fold restricted in peak titer during multi-cycle replication compared to rHPIV2-WT, whereas the previously described rPIV2/P-edit was restricted over 10,000-fold in the same cell line (Nishio et al., 2005) . The reason for this difference in replication between the two constructs of rHPIV2-V ko was not defined. It is noteworthy that, in the present study, the entire sequence of the rHPIV2-V ko mutant was analyzed, identifying only a single adventitious mutation. This involved a substitution in the N gene-end signal that changed the length of the poly(A) segment from 7 to 6 residues, a type of change that is common in paramyxoviruses and is usually innocuous (Collins and Crowe, 2007; Kolakofsky et al., 1998; Rassa et al., 2000) . This mutation does not alter the length of the untranslated region, and other variable gene-end poly(A) tracts have been demonstrated to be functionally equivalent in directing polyadenylation (Rassa et al., 2000) . This virus was largely replication competent and did not reduce the expression of the N and P proteins, suggesting that this single adventitious mutation was inconsequential and that rHPIV2-V ko was a clean V-deletion mutant. It should be noted that there may be increased expression of P protein due to the elimination of RNA editing. This method of ablating V expression removes the possibility of generating a truncated V or W protein but introduces the possibility that greater P expression may also have contributed to the reduction in rHPIV2-V ko replication.",

A role for V in replication in vitro has been seen with other rubulaviruses and could be due to a recently reported function of V in promoting virus growth through an interaction with the L polymerase . A C-terminal truncation mutant of the PIV5 V protein was restricted in replication in IFN-competent cells but grew as efficiently as PIV5 WT in Vero cells, while a PIV5 deletion mutant lacking the entire V protein could not be recovered at all . In IFN competent cells, however, all of the reported rubulavirus V knockout and truncation mutants grow poorly and form pinpoint plaques . The severe restriction of replication seen with rubulavirus V knockout and V truncation mutants in IFN competent cells is not seen with similar V mutants derived from viruses of other paramyxovirus genera (Delenda et al., 1997; Kato et al., 1997a; Patterson et al., 2000) . The respirovirus Sendai virus (SeV), for example, grows efficiently in IFN competent cells without V protein, suggesting that V is less crucial for replication of respiroviruses than for rubulaviruses (Delenda et al., 1997; Kato et al., 1997a) . This likely is because these other genera also possess the accessory C protein, which is not found in rubulaviruses; the functions of the rubulavirus V protein are distributed between the V and C proteins of these other genera. Taken together, these data point toward a role of both IFNdependent and IFN-independent functions of V in enabling virus replication in vitro.",

All of the paramyxovirus V proteins examined to date have been shown to down-regulate IFN-\u03b2 induction using a mechanism linked to interaction of the C-terminus of V protein with the helicase domain of MDA5 to block its activation and signaling to IRF3 (Andrejeva et al., 2004; Berghall et al., 2006; Childs et al., 2007; Childs et al., 2009) . Although several studies have indicated that RIG-I is the primary helicase for sensing paramyxoviruses rather than MDA5 Kato et al., 2006; Loo et al., 2008) , the conservation of the V-MDA5 interaction across the four above-mentioned paramyxovirus genera signifies that its role is likely important. Why RIG-I, which does not seem to be a target of paramyxovirus V proteins (Childs et al., 2007; Yoneyama et al., 2005) , apparently does not function efficiently in cells infected with rubulaviruses to produce activated IRF3/7 and induce IFN-\u03b2 remains undefined.",

            "text": "rHPIV2-WT also inhibited the signaling of IFN-\u03b2 by efficiently degrading STAT2 whereas rHPIV2-V ko did not, confirming previous observations that HPIV2 modulates IFN signaling in human and monkey cells by proteasomal degradation of STAT2 rather than STAT1, which is targeted by rubulaviruses PIV5, SV41 and MuV (Andrejeva et al., 2002; Didcock et al., 1999a; Didcock et al., 1999b; Nishio et al., 2005; Nishio et al., 2001; Parisien et al., 2001; Precious et al., 2005; Ulane and Horvath, 2002; Ulane et al., 2005; Young et al., 2000) . Our demonstration that rHPIV2-WT can degrade STAT2 and block the antiviral effects of IFN-\u03b2 in AGM-derived Vero cells, while rHPIV2-V ko cannot, supports the use of AGMs as a suitable in vivo model to examine the effect of V on replication in vivo, likely reflecting the observation that human and monkey STAT1 and STAT2 proteins are highly conserved, sharing 99.3% and 97.8% amino acid identity, respectively, between species (Nishio et al., 2005) . rHPIV2-V ko infection induced extensive CPE in vitro whereas rHPIV2-WT was largely noncytopathic until very late in infection. Several diverse and complex pathways can lead to PIVinduced apoptosis, and V can play a role in preventing apoptosis of infected cells Lei et al., 2009; Peters, Chattopadhyay, and Sen, 2008; Sun et al., 2004; Wansley and Parks, 2002) . PIV5 and SeV V mutant viruses, like rHPIV2-V ko , were more cytopathic than their respective WT viruses (Capraro et al., 2008; Kato et al., 1997a) . The HPIV2 V truncation mutant induced more cell death in Vero cells than HPIV2-WT . In the present study, the mechanism of cell death for rHPIV2-V ko -infected cells was characterized, and the findings indicate that the CPE did not appear to be solely apoptotic in nature. We observed significantly more syncytia formation upon infection with rHPIV2-V ko than with rHPIV2-WT beginning at very early times in infection. Since our rHPIV2-WT and the rHPIV2-V ko mutant are identical in protein sequence except for the V deletion, the difference in syncytia phenotype was not due to differences in sequence of F or HN although changes in F or HN clearly can alter this phenotype Yuasa et al., 1995) . rHPIV2-V ko exhibited greater necrosis than rHPIV2-WT infected cells and induced a low level of apoptosis, but the relationship between syncytia formation and necrosis was not further defined. Thus, apoptosis, cell necrosis, and syncytia formation contributed to the enhanced CPE seen with rHPIV2-V ko infection, with necrosis appearing to be a greater contributor than apoptosis. rHPIV2-V ko was not recovered from the URT and LRT of AGMs, indicating that the V protein is required for detectable replication of HPIV2 in vivo in non-human primates. To address whether this restriction of replication was specific to the organized epithelium of monkeys, i.e., a host range effect that could be specified by the V protein (Parisien, Lau, and Horvath, 2002; Park et al., 2003) , the replication of rHPIV2-V ko was also examined in human organized epithelial cultures. Replication was not seen in the human organized epithelial cells, confirming that HPIV2 V has a profound effect on replication in both human and monkey organized epithelia. The ability of V mutant viruses to exhibit attenuation in vivo has been seen with other paramyxoviruses. A V mutant of PIV5 was restricted in replication in ferrets but not mice, a clear host range difference (Capraro et al., 2008) . A measles virus V ko mutant was attenuated in rhesus monkeys, as assessed by the absence of clinical illness and a reduction in the magnitude and duration of viremia . Similarly, V protein defective canine distemper virus was restricted 50-to 100-fold in replication in ferrets (von Messling, Svitek, and Cattaneo, 2006) . SeV V mutants that replicated efficiently in vitro were significantly attenuated in mice with a shorter duration of replication and approximately 10-fold lower peak titers than WT SeV (Kato et al., 1997a; Kato et al., 1997b) . The greater restriction of rHPIV2-V ko in vivo than morbillivirus or SeV V mutants perhaps is due to V's role as the sole IFN antagonist in HPIV2, whereas measles and SeV have both V and C proteins contributing to IFN antagonism.",

Development of a live attenuated HPIV2 vaccine based on loss of the V protein IFN antagonist functions would require that putative IFN antagonist domains in V be altered selectively and that the domains responsible for the protein's functions in genome replication, viral fitness, and virus assembly be defined and remain unaltered in vaccine viruses. We are currently constructing rHPIV2 mutant viruses in which the V and P genes are expressed from separate genes permitting the introduction of mutations in V without affecting P. Only then can the contribution of each individual function of V to attenuation and immunogenicity be assessed and appropriately utilized in HPIV2 vaccine development. Clearly, the loss of all V functions over-attenuates HPIV2 in vivo.",

Four unique, silent restriction enzyme sites were inserted into the rHPIV2-WT antigenomic sense cDNA to facilitate incorporation of a P gene containing a mutated editing site: an AscI site at nucleotides 1986 -1993 (GCCACACA to GGCGCGCC), BstEII and AgeI sites at nucleotides 3188-3197 (GGTGCAATCA to GGTTACCGGT), and a SacII site at nucleotides 3221-3226 (CCGATC to CCGCGG). Virus recovered by reverse genetics from a plasmid containing these new restriction enzyme sites grew equivalently to rHPIV2-WT in cell culture (data not shown). PCR mutagenesis was then used to modify the RNA editing site from AGGGGGGGAG to AGAGGAGGTGAG (changes underlined) by (i) adding two G residues to shift the reading frame to encode P and (ii) changing three of the seven consecutive G residues to prevent further editing. All mutations were silent in the P ORF. In addition, four nucleotides (TGAC) were inserted in noncoding sequence before the BstEII/ AgeI sites to correct for the \"rule of six\" (Skiadopoulos et al., 2003) . All regions of the mutated cDNAs that had been subjected to in vitro polymerase reactions were sequenced using a Perkin-Elmer ABI 3730 sequencer with the BigDye sequencing kit v1.1 (Perkin-Elmer Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK) as previously described (Newman et al., 2004) .",

Bar graphs show IFN-\u03b2 concentrations (scale on right Y-axis), which were determined by comparison with an IFN-\u03b2 standard curve and are expressed in pg/ml \u00b1 SE based on results for triplicate samples from two independent experiments. Asterisks indicate samples in which IFN-\u03b2 levels were significantly higher than in rHPIV2-WT-infected culture supernatant at the same time point (p<0.001). The lower limit of detection was 12 pg/ml. Line graphs show the virus titer (scale on left Y-axis) for each sample, determined by 10-fold serial dilution of the culture supernatant on LLC-MK2 cells.
