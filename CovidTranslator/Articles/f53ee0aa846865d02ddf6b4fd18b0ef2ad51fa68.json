It has a significant mortality rate and delayed chronic morbidity caused by short bowel syndrome. 35 Manifestation is by systemic signs and symptoms suggestive of neonatal sepsis and shock. The gastrointestinal manifestations include abdominal tenderness and distension, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, emesis, ileus (gastric residuals), intestinal perforation, and peritonitis] 5 The diagnosis is suggested when an infant has the signs and symptoms described above and is confirmed by the radiologic signs of pneumatosis intestinalis or portal venous gas, or both. The appearance of the intestine reveals hemorrhagic or coagulation necrosis with visible gas-filled cysts along the subserosal and submucosal layers. 1,z,5 These cysts correspond to the pneumatosis intestinalis observed on the abdominal radiograph. The microscopic appearance of the intestinal tissue demonstrates mucosal edema, hemorrhage, coagulation necrosis, and mucosal ulceration covered by a pseudomembranous exudate.",

Many of the risk factors associated with ischemia are common to all premature infants. It is therefore probable that the identification of these factors in a patient is coincidental and not causal.

Treatment with IgA may have achieved higher gut levels of specific antibodies against potential pathogens. Alternatively, immunoglogulins may have other protective roles. NEC has been associated with some forms of milk protein allergy; exogenous immunoglobulins may block the allergic-immune response. 1 The volume or rate of increase of milk feedings may be a contributor to the development of NEC. Some studies have suggested that giving nothing by mouth for 1 or 2 weeks may lower the incidence of NEC. 23 However, new evidence suggests that early enteral feeding does not necessarily predispose infants to a higher incidence of NEC. 24\"29 Excessive milk volume and rapid increases of volume have been suggested as a risk factor for NEC. 2' 27, 3o Large volumes may produce stress on an already injured intestinal mueosa. Overfeeding and distension may interfere with the ability to increase mesenteric blood flow after a meal and thus may produce local intestinal hypoxemia. In addition, overfeeding may cause malabsorption of lactose, which is common if the premature infant is overfed. The colonic bacteria ferment lactose to short-chain organic acids and hydrogen gas; the latter is present in large quantities in the lumen and in the gas-filled cysts noted as pneumatosis intestinalis. 31 The large amount of hydrogen produced by the colonic bacteria results in intestinal distension. Gaseous distension may increase luminal tension; as the intraluminal pressure increases, the perfusion to the mucosa becomes compromised and may produce vascular insufficiency.",
