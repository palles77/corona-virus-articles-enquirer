SARS-CoV 3CLpro is functionally analogous to the main picornaviral protease 3Cpro and there have been significant drug-design efforts against human rhinoviral 3C protease which is also a cysteine protease. 10 We recently described structurebased design of a number of potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. 11 These inhibitors were designed based upon modification of AG7088, a potent inhibitor of the human rhinoviral 3C protease. 12 While AG7088 does not exhibit inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro, the modified inhibitors are active in enzymatic assays as well as in cell culture assays. 13 The X-ray structure of inhibitor-bound SARS-3CLpro revealed important molecular insight into the ligand-binding sites of enzyme. 11 The inhibitors bind to SARS-CoV-3CLpro through covalent bonding with the active site cysteine 145 residue. Based upon this molecular insight, we have now modified our initial inhibitors to accommodate specific ligand-binding site interactions in the S 4 -subsite of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site. Herein we describe the synthesis, biological evaluation and X-ray structures of inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV-3CLpro for two potent peptide and peptide-mimetic inhibitors.",

His-172 makes hydrogen-bond with the P1-lactam-NH, and the Glu-166 nitrogen makes a hydrogen bond with the ketone of the inhibitor. 11 The P4oxazole group appears to fill in the S 4 -hydrophobic pocket.

The reaction components, with the exception of substrate, were incubated for 20 minutes and the reaction was initiated by the addition of FRET-substrate [AlexaFluor\u00ae 488-cys]-Glu-Ser-Ala-Thr-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Leu-Ala-[Lys-QSY\u00ae-7]-Ser, giving a final substrate concentration of 1 \u03bcM. 11,16 The IC 50 values for inhibitors were determined by measuring the rates of reaction with increasing inhibitor concentrations. As shown in Table 1 , our structure-based incorporation of P 4 -Boc ser in place of P 4 -oxazole in inhibitor 2 resulted in (inhibitor 3) significant enhancement of enzymatic inhibitory potency, while its antiviral activity was not improved. It exhibited antiviral activity similar to inhibitors 1 and 2. This difference of activity may be due to the presence of peptide-like features in the inhibitors. Peptide-like molecules often exhibit poor passive transcellular diffusion across cell membranes. Antiviral assays followed our previously published protocol. 11, 18 We have compared the binding affinity of the corresponding peptide-based inhibitors incorporating both P 4 -oxazole and P 4 -Boc ser. Peptide-based inhibitors (4 and 5) with P 2 -Leu and P 2 -Phe have displayed 20-fold enzymatic potency enhancement over the respective inhibitors (16 and 17) containing P 4 -oxazole.",

A stereoview of the inhibitor-bound structure is shown in Figure 2 .

The P\u00b41ethyl ester carbonyl is within proximity to Thr-26 oxygen (3.38\u00c5). The Leu-27 side-chain makes hydrophobic contacts with P\u00b41-ligand.
