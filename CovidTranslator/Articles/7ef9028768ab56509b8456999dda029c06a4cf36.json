Given the prevalence of these chronic conditions, more than 100,000 people are on waiting lists in the United States for SOTs. While wait-list length is influenced by changes in demand, listing practices, death rates, donation rates, and allocation policies, it is important to be aware that the demand for SOT is increasing (Fig. 1) . 3 SOT recipients are at risk for infections in the short and long term, resulting in higher morbidity and mortality. 4 Unlike the vast majority of hematopoietic cell transplant recipients who eventually have immunosuppressive medications discontinued, SOT patients require lifelong immunosuppression and therefore remain at lifelong increased risk of infection. 5 To avoid transplant rejection the commonly used immunosuppression regimens are broadly acting, decreasing both cellular and humoral immunity. Reduced cellular immunity leaves hosts susceptible to viral, fungal, and intracellular pathogens while decreased humoral immunity increases the risk for encapsulated bacteria. In most SOT recipients the degree of immunosuppression, and hence the infectious risk, tends to decrease over time, but never returns to a normal baseline. For those who develop recurrent or chronic organ rejection and require intensification of their immunosuppressive regimen, the risk for infection remains high. Usual immunosuppressive regimens include a corticosteroid, a calcineurin inhibitor, and an antimetabolite. 5 More care is decentralized from major transplant centers.",

For example, tests that rely on the host's immune system (eg, serology) may be less sensitive than direct detection of the pathogen. Although serologic tests can help identify latent infections, antibody development to acute infections may be delayed or never develop in immunosuppressed patients. Instead, direct detection of pathogens using culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and so forth, from optimal specimens is preferred. 5, 7 To add to the complexity, SOT patients are more likely than immunocompetent patients to have rapid progression of infection because of the lack of an appropriate immune response. An example is pneumonia, which can be safely treated in the ambulatory setting in most immunocompetent patients but can often result in hospitalization in SOT patients. 8 SOT patients are more likely to have multiple pathogens and resistance patterns that complicate the choice of antimicrobial therapy. 7 Early involvement of infectious disease specialists may be warranted.

Lung transplant recipients are most vulnerable, followed by liver, then kidney transplant patients. 13 Whereas healthy patients typically shed the virus 1 day prior and up to 1 week following the onset of symptoms, SOT patients can be infectious for weeks to months because of their inability to clear the virus, 14 and are more likely to present with atypical symptoms including no or only a low-grade fever (50%-80% of SOT patients with influenza present with fever). Hence, symptoms of rhinorrhea, dry cough, sore throat, or gastrointestinal symptoms of stomach upset and diarrhea commonly seen in noninfluenza respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infections may be the only presenting symptoms of influenza. When fever is present in the setting of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, it is a very predictive sign for influenza in SOT patients. 12 SOT patients are more prone to develop lower respiratory tract infections, including influenza pneumonia (47% of hospitalized SOT patients), secondary bacterial pneumonia (Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, 17% of hospitalized SOT patients), other bacterial superinfections, and extrarespiratory manifestations such as central nervous system or myocardial involvement. 12 As a result, SOT patients may require hospitalization and aggressive management of influenza infection more commonly than immunocompetent patients.",

There is some controversy about the optimal timing of vaccination posttransplant, but the prudent approach is to vaccinate SOT patients as soon as the seasonal vaccine is available before influenza season. The efficacy of vaccination may be lower in SOT patients than in immunocompetent patients, but does appear to be safe. One study found that of the population of SOT patients diagnosed with influenza, 50% had received the vaccination and none of these patients had protective levels of antibodies against influenza at the time of admission. The same study showed that influenza vaccination decreased the risk of associated pneumonia (relative risk 0.3) in comparison with SOT patients who were not immunized. 15 There is no evidence that additional benefit is gained from highdose vaccines or intradermal inoculation. The live attenuated nasal vaccine is contraindicated in immunocompromised persons, including those who have received a SOT. Evidence does not show an increased risk for graft rejection or failure with influenza vaccination. 16 Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in SOT patients is common (3 times higher incidence than in immunocompetent individuals) and dangerous (11%-43% mortality rate). 17, 18 A Canadian case-control study found that immunosuppressive medications increased the risk for CAP, with an odds ratio of 15. 17 Despite the uniquely higher risk facing SOT patients, the IDSA and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) do not specifically consider immunosuppressed patients in their consensus guidelines for CAP. Rather, the guidelines address CAP and separate guidelines address nosocomial pneumonia (recent hospitalization or institutional settings). 19 For this patient, the presentation in the 3-to 6-month posttransplant period increases her risk for opportunistic infections, given the effects of longer duration and higher dose of immunosuppressive medications. Viral infections such as CMV and respiratory viruses can cause primary lung infections during this time, and can also complicate matters by further decreasing immunity and increasing the risk for opportunistic infections such as Aspergillus fumigatus and PJP. 10 ",

She reports 7 days of subjective fevers and a nonproductive cough. She has no rhinorrhea, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or body ache, but she has had anorexia and some mild night sweats. She has had many wellwishers at her home since returning and suspects she could have had an infectious exposure. VS: T 38.1 C, HR 96, BP 132/90, RR 24, O 2 sat 94% on room air. On examination she is speaking in full sentences but looks tired. She has scattered shoddy cervical adenopathy, no nuchal rigidity, and some scattered inspiratory crackles bilaterally. There are wheezes, and her lungs are equally resonant on percussion. Her heart is regular without a murmur, she has a reassuring soft abdominal examination, and her transplant kidney is nontender on palpation. ATS and IDSA recommend the use of assessment tools of pneumonia severity to determine the appropriate care setting: ambulatory, inpatient, or ICU. CURB-65 is a recommended tool that gives 1 point for Confusion, Uremia, Respiratory rate greater than 30/min, Blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and age 65 or older. A score greater than or equal to 2 on CURB-65 should spur providers to consider hospitalizing patients. The pneumonia severity index (PSI) is the other recommended tool, and has 11 initial elements to the assessment. If patients have any of the 11 elements they are risk stratified into 4 higher-risk classes that correlate to 30-day mortality risk, as does CURB-65. 19 PSI has a higher discriminatory power and is more accurate in lower-risk patients. Neither tool specifically considers immunosuppression or SOT as a risk factor for severe disease. Hence, it is important for PCPs to use such tools with caution in SOT patients. Current guidelines recommend these tools be used for supplemental data, and that the physician's determination of the patient's global risk be the primary determinant of the treatment plan. 19 In SOT patients with lower respiratory symptoms of cough, dyspnea, increased respiratory rate, or fever, testing should include complete blood count, chemistry panel, blood cultures, sputum culture, and a chest radiograph. Although chest radiographs have lower sensitivity in immunosuppressed people, the pattern of disease on radiography can still be helpful. Focal airspace disease is correlated with bacterial (and mycobacterial) pneumonia. Multifocal airspace disease and nodular infiltrates have a much broader differential (as discussed earlier). Diffuse and interstitial patterns are concerning for pneumocystis or viral infections. In immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates, chest CT scan and bronchoscopy have clearly shown benefit in distinguishing among infectious and noninfectious causes. 20, 21 Consensus guidelines recommend empiric treatment with institutionally tailored antibiotic choices that should reflect the resistance in the community. PCPs should not delay empiric therapy while waiting for testing. Usual choices of a respiratory fluoroquinolone, macrolides, or broader-spectrum b-lactams 1 a macrolide are also reasonable empiric therapy for SOT patients. 19 Depending on clinical presentation, severity scores, reliability and level of home support, some patients can be treated as an outpatient with very close follow-up, whereas others need to be managed in the inpatient setting. Hospitalizing immunosuppressed SOT patients and putting them at risk for nosocomial infections is an important consideration. Early consultation with pulmonary and infectious disease specialists, very close follow-up, and rapid escalation of the intensity of both diagnostic and therapeutic efforts depending on response are appropriate.",

Risk factors include a history of posttransplant dialysis, age, and female gender. 29 Factors that may increase the risk for recurrent UTI include ureteric stricture, vesicoureteral reflux, prolonged urinary catheterization, and overimmunosuppression. 29 UTIs occur at higher frequency with increased morbidity in renal transplant recipients. Studies are mixed, and have not convincingly demonstrated an increased risk for graft rejection or increased mortality due to UTIs. 29, 31, 32 Whereas some studies have found that specific immunosuppressive regimens and intensity of immunosuppression appear to increase the risk of UTIs, other studies do not support the notion that UTIs are opportunistic infections in SOT patients. Rather, the increased risk is thought to be due to other factors ( Table 2 ) and posttransplant anatomic changes that effectively define all UTIs in renal transplant patients as \"complicated UTIs.\" 29, 30 Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) without signs and symptoms of infection is common in renal transplant patients. ASB has been associated with increased risk for UTI in the first year, but significant controversy exists about whether it should be treated within that time frame. 33 Candiduria is common, affecting up to 10% of renal transplant patients, but it is mostly asymptomatic. 33 The approach to asymptomatic candiduria is also controversial, given the paucity of available data on this topic. No convincing data exist to show that graft survival, morbidity, or mortality improves with treatment of asymptomatic candiduria in kidney transplant patients. 33 The diagnosis of cystitis is the same in SOT patients as it is for the general population. The important caveats are that urine culture should be obtained in all SOT patients given the higher risk of multidrug-resistant bacterial infections, and that upper tract (ie, kidney allograft) infections are very common in kidney transplant recipients. Pyelonephritis should be considered in kidney transplant patients with signs/symptoms of cystitis accompanied by fever, bacteremia, increased creatinine, leukocytosis, chills, or pain/tenderness over the transplanted kidney. 29 Many transplant centers use trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis in renal transplant patients during the first 6 to 12 months after transplantation, and this appears to also decrease the risk of UTI. However, this has also been associated with breakthrough infections caused by trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazoleresistant organisms. Long-term prophylaxis has been shown to decrease the incidence of UTI, although the growing resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole among GNRs, reportedly more than 80% in some settings, limits the utility of long-term antibiotic prophylaxis. 29, 33 A multicenter, prospective cohort study followed 4000 SOT patients over 2 years of follow-up, during which 208 episodes of UTI occurred in renal transplant recipients. The vast majority were due to GNRs (>50% Escherichia coli, 10% Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6% other gram negatives) and only 7% due to Enterococcus species. 29 Several studies also identify Staphylococcus species as common pathogens in renal SOT patients. 30, 33 An alarming amount of antibiotic resistance was observed, with more than one-quarter identified as extendedspectrum b-lactamase resistance (ESBL). Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus are all increasing in frequency. 34 Regarding follow-up, this patient has typical symptoms of cystitis; however, she also has tenderness over her transplanted kidney and fever, suggesting associated allograft pyelonephritis. It is inappropriate to use antibiotics that are effective only for lower UTIs (eg, nitrofurantoin and fosfomycin). The infection has occurred while receiving prophylactic trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, making this inappropriate empiric therapy. Despite evidence of growing resistance in some strains, fluoroquinolones remain a reasonable option for empiric therapy. 29 However, at centers with high rates of resistance to fluoroquinolones, treatment with broader-spectrum antibiotics might be appropriate. Other common pathogens causing cystitis/graft pyelonephritis in kidney transplant patients include Enterococcus and Pseudomonas.",

The American Society of Transplantation (AST) 2009 guidelines recommend that any live vaccines be administered at least 4 weeks before transplant. 36 Even inactivated/killed vaccinations should be considered pretransplant when possible, because of the anticipated better response rate. Although end-stage chronic illnesses that necessitate SOT might be associated with reduced immune response to vaccinations, immunologic response to vaccinations is thought to be even further suppressed in the posttransplant period. 35 ",

The evidence that HPV causes cervical cancer is excellent, and the increased risk of cervical cancer evidenced in HIV immunosuppression has been extrapolated to apply to SOT patients. However, in 2011 Engels and colleagues 44 evaluated data from a United States registry of more than 400,000 SOT patients and found no increased risk of cervical cancer. In addition, a 10-year prospective case-control study of 48 renal and K-P SOT patients showed no increased risk of cervical cancer in the SOT patients. 45 Despite the emerging data that immunosuppression in SOT recipients might not necessarily increase the risk of cervical cancer, at present PCPs should follow updated USPSTF cervical cancer screening guidelines from 2012, which explicitly exclude immunosuppressed patients from lengthening the screening interval beyond 1 year. 43 SUMMARY SOT recipients need PCPs who are familiar with their unique needs. Understanding the lifelong infectious risks faced by SOT patients because of their need for lifelong immunosuppressive medications is fundamental. SOT recipients can present with atypical and muted manifestations of infections. The savvy, prepared PCP will keep a careful eye on the patient and initiate a comprehensive evaluation for infectious etiology. PCPs should work together with their local (infectious disease and other) specialists to generate care plans if the diagnosis or management is in question.",

This gap widened over the decade, meaning that the waiting times from listing to transplant continued to increase. The number of living-donor transplants grew until 2004 while the number of decreased donor transplants continued to rise gradually until 2006. (Data from Harper SA, Bradley JS, Englund JA, et al.

            "text": "Changing timeline of infection after organ transplantation. Infections occur in a generally predictable pattern after solid organ transplantation. The development of infection is delayed by prophylaxis and accelerated by intensified immunosuppression, drug toxic effects that may cause leukopenia, or immunomodulatory viral infections such as infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). At the time of transplantation, a patient's short-term and long-term risk of infection can be stratified according to donor and recipient screening, the technical outcome of surgery, and the intensity of immunosuppression required to prevent graft rejection. Subsequently, an ongoing assessment of the risk of infection is used to adjust both prophylaxis and immunosuppressive therapy.
