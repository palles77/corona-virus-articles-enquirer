A threshold dynamics determined by the basic reproduction number 0 is established: The disease can be eradicated if 0 < 1, while the disease persists if 0 > 1. As an application, six different screening strategies are explored to examine the impacts of screening on the control of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. We find that it is crucial to screen travelers from and to high-risk patches, and it is not necessary to implement screening in all connected patches, and both the dispersal rates and the successful detection rate of screening play an important role on determining an effective and practical screening strategy.",

International travel has been a major factor causing the SARS outbreak in 2003 (Lipsitch et al. 2003; Ruan et al. 2006) , the A (H1N1) influenza pandemic in 2009 (Tang et al. 2010 (Tang et al. , 2012 Yu et al. 2012) , and the outbreak of a novel avian-origin influenza A(H7N9) . To better understand how travel among patches (a patch could be as small as a community village, or as large as a country or even a continent) influences the spread of infectious diseases, many deterministic models involving the interaction and dispersal of meta-populations in two or multiple patches have been proposed and investigated. See for example, Allen et al. (2007) , Alonso and McKane (2002) , Arino et al. (2005) , van den Driessche (2003a, b, 2006) , Bolker (1999) , Brauer and van den Driessche (2001) , Brauer et al.

For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak a pandemic in June of 2009. As a response, many countries implemented the entry-exit health screening measures for travelers (Ainseba and Iannelli 2012; Cowling et al. 2010) . In China, a national surveillance was established which includes the border entry screening: Any one entering China was required to undergo screening at the border. Moreover, all patients with suspected A (H1N1) pdm09 virus infection were admitted to designated hospitals for containment (Yu et al. 2010) . Exit screening was also conducted by the screening of travelers at Mexican airports before they boarded flights out of Mexico (Khan et al. 2013 ). There are several broad approaches to border screening, including scan of travelers by thermal scanners for elevated body temperature, observation of travelers by alert staff for influenza symptoms (e.g., cough) as well as collection of health declaration forms (Cowling et al. 2010; Li et al. 2013) . During the 2009 A (H1N1) pandemic, it was shown that about one-third of confirmed imported H1N1 cases were identified through entry screening to Hong Kong and Singapore (Cowling et al. 2010) , while for China, the detection rate of entry screening was about 45.56 % (1027 detected cases over the total 2254 imported cases) (Li et al. 2013) .",

As screening measures may have tremendous impacts on travel and trade and hence result in huge consequences in public health and economy, it is of great importance to assess the effectiveness and impact of the entry-exit screening measures on the spread and control of infectious diseases. In this regard, a recent study analyzed the effectiveness of border entry screening in China during this pandemic (Yu et al. 2012) , and another paper performed a retrospective evaluation for the entry and exit screening of travelers flying out of Mexico during the A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic (Khan et al. 2013) .",

Hyman et al. (2003) formulated models with random screening to estimate the effectiveness of control measures on the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases. In Nyabadza and Mukandavire (2011) , screening strategy through HIV counseling was incorporated into the model to qualify its impact on prevention of HIV/AIDS epidemic in South Africa. For other epidemic models with screening, we refer to Ainseba and Iannelli (2012) , Hove-Musekwa and Nyabadza (2009 ), Liu et al. (2011 ), Liu and Takeuchi (2006 , Liu and Stechlinski (2013) .

It is shown that the entry-exit screening measures have the potential to eradicate the disease induced by the transport-related infection when the disease is otherwise endemic when both cities are isolated. Note that the models in Liu et al. (2011) , Liu and Takeuchi (2006) do not include a latent compartment, while many infectious diseases do undergo latent stages before they show obvious symptoms and become actively infectious. In this paper, we will incorporate the entry-exit screening measures into a compartmental deterministic model with multiple patches and study the impacts of the entry-exit screening measures on the spread and control of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1).",

In Sect. 3, we identify the basic reproduction number and establish a global threshold dynamics for our model. In Sect. 4, we apply the results in Sect. 3 to the case study of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic: We show the sensitivities of the basic reproduction number upon the variation of other parameters before we discuss the impacts of various screening strategies on the control of influenza A (H1N1). We conclude this paper in Sect. 5 with a summary and discussion.",

In our simulations, we take \u03b8 e j1 = \u03b8 for j = 2, 3, 4, 5, and all other screening rates are set to be zero.

Our theoretical results, Theorems 1 and 2, were established by appealing to the comparison principle and uniform persistence principle. Our results show that the disease dies out when 0 < 1 and persists when 0 > 1. Thus the basic reproduction number is a vital index to measure the level of the disease (Bauch and Rand 2000; Clancy and Pearce 2013) . Our Proposition 1 provides a theoretical confirmation for the simulation results obtained in Sattenspiel and Herring's (2003) : When the dispersal rates are very low, screening must be highly effective to alter disease patterns significantly.",
