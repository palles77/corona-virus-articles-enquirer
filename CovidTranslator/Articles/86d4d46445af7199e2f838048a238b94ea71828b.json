            "text": "Monocyte/macrophages and activated lymphocytes traffic through normal brain, and this trafficking is increased in inflammatory conditions such as HIV encephalitis (HIVE). HIVE is characterized in part by perivascular accumulations of macrophages. The earliest events in this process are poorly understood and difficult or impossible to address in humans. The SIV-infected macaque model of neuroAIDS has demonstrated migration of monocytes into the brain early in disease, coincident with peak SIV viremia. The chemotactic signals that initiate the increased emigration of mononuclear cells into the CNS have not been described. Here we describe astrocytes as a primary source of chemokines to facilitate basal levels of monocyte trafficking to CNS and that increased CCL7 production may be responsible for initiating the increased trafficking in neuroAIDS. We have previously published complementary in vivo work demonstrating the presence of MCP-3/CCL7 within the brain of SIV-infected macaques. Here we demonstrate that MCP-3/CCL7 is a significant chemokine produced by astrocytes, that basal monocyte migration may be facilitated by astrocyte-derived CCL7, that production of CCL7 is rapidly increased by TNF and thus likely plays a critical role in initiating neuroinvasion by SIV/ HIV.",

The glia limitans, formed predominantly by astrocyte foot processes, lines the basement membrane of microvascular brain endothelia. Thus, these cells are optimally situated to provide chemotactic signaling for emigration of monocytes/macrophages in to the brain. Bone marrow derived perivascular macrophages are the predominant cell type productively infected by HIV and SIV (30) . Perivascular macrophages have relatively short half-lives and are replenished by circulating monocytes that traffic to the CNS. These cells are also known to traffic through brain (31) . NeuroAIDS associated with SIV or HIV infection of macaques and humans respectively is characterized by perivascular accumulations of macrophages many of which are infected. Whether these cells are actively recruited or selectively retained in the brain is unclear. In late stage disease abundant expression of \u03b2-chemokines in brain parenchyma has been described which would be expected to contribute to increased recruitment of monocytes/macrophages (3) . The signals involved in the initial recruitment/neuroinvasion of SIV/HIV infected monocytes/ macrophages across the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are unknown. It is known, however, that viral infection of monocytes does not alter their chemotaxis (18) , and that monocytes/ macrophages, microglia (11) and astrocytes (13) can all secrete proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines, to which monocyte/macrophages respond. It has been proposed that the initial neuroinvasion is mediated at least in part by astrocyte production of MCP-1/CCL2 (26) . However, in vivo data examining MCP-1/CCL2 production in the brain parenchyma of SIV/HIV-infected individuals is conflicting (12, 20) . Furthermore, MCP-1/CCL2 would also be expected to cause large numbers of lymphocytes to migrate into the CNS -an event rarely observed with either HIV or SIV infection or SIVE/HIVE.",

The premier in vivo model of HIV CNS infection is the SIV-infected rhesus macaque (8, 16, 20, 24, 29, 30) . In vitro models have been developed to approximate early events of HIV-induced neurological disease (18, 26) . We hypothesized that the initiation of neuroinvasion by monocyte/macrohpages is likely an exaggeration of the normal trafficking patterns to replace perivascular macrophages. We further hypothesized that chemokines secreted by astrocytes may be responsible for this basal level of monocyte turnover in the CNS based in part on observations that astrocytes under resting conditions produces chemokines capable of inducing monocyte migration which is enhanced by TNF-\u03b1 (13) . Until now, this basal migration induced by astrocyte conditioned media has been regarded as a nuisance for chemotactic studies, something that can be reduced by replacing the medium immediately before starting the chemotaxis assays (22) .",

            "text": "The current study suggests CCL7 is responsible for normal trafficking of monocytes/ macrophages through the BBB (into the parenchyma), and, thus, for initiating SIV/HIV neuroinvasion. This interpretation is supported by the presence of CCL7 in normal brain tissues of both humans and rhesus macaques (20) . Furthermore, molecular analysis of the chemokine mRNA produced by resting astrocytes in culture showed CCL7 was the predominant chemokine produced. This mRNA was translated into protein, as supernatants of astrocytes in culture contained chemokines capable of inducing chemotaxis in resting monocytes (yet not in lymphocytes). Taken together, these data suggest that previously observed trafficking of hematogenous cells through brain may be due in very large measure to production of CCL7 by astrocytes, most probably at foot processes as the majority of these mononuclear cells are immediately adjacent to the BBB (31) . Further evidence for this story is given by a demonstration by Chen and colleagues that CCR2, a receptor for CCL7 is required to be present on monocytes/macrophages for migration into virally infected brain (1) .",

We focused on TNF-\u03b1 because there is an initial increase in levels of TNF-\u03b1 within brains of monkeys infected with SIVmac251 associated with SIV neuroinvasion (14) . Astrocytes are known to produce chemokines under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1 (5, 13, (25) (26) (27) . Data from several groups indicate that HIV-infected monocyte/macrophages are activated and produce significant quantities of TNF-\u03b1 (24, 26) . Thus we expected to find an increase in chemokine production in astroctyes treated with TNF-\u03b1. This was observed, but the effect was not global, with striking increase in the mRNA levels of chemokines (such as CCL2, CCL7, CCL5 and CCL4) associated with monocyte recruitment. Elevations of each of these chemokines has previously been associated with neuroAIDS in humans or macaques (2, 17, 20, 21) . The probable synergistic, or at the very least sequential release of these chemokines would be expected to increase numbers of monocytes/macrophages to migrate through the BBB, and thus augment neuroinvasion and the formation of perivascular cuffs prominent in neuroAIDS.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we suggest that CCL7 may be responsible for initial entry of HIV-infected cells into the brain, probably during 'normal' turnover of perivascular macrophages (4, 31) . Subsequent production of TNF-\u03b1 in the parenchyma by these infected, activated macrophages stimulates astrocytes to produce increased levels of CCL7 and additional chemokines, notably CCL2, CCL5 and CCL4 that are important for further recruitment of monocyte/macrophage to the CNS. Monocytes/macrophages were observed to have increased chemotaxis in response to supernatants from astrocytes in culture. This was dose-dependent, and could be diluted out with astrocyte culture media (A). Migrated cells were determined to be macrophages by using forward and side scatter gating, followed by gating through CD11b. Cells added to the upper compartment contained approximately 35% lymphocytes and 14% monocytes. Cells that had migrated to astrocyte supernatant contained approximately 70% monocytes and less than 3% lymphocytes (C). Preincubation of astrocytes for 48 hours with TNF-\u03b1 (D, grey bars) led to increased migration of PBMCs through the blood-brain barrier model over migration to cytokine alone (black bars) with migrated cells comprising 76% monocytes, and 3% lymphocytes. Gene array analyses demonstrated that of the 23 chemokines tested, mRNA for CCL7 was produced in quantities significantly above all other genes tested by resting astrocytes (black bars). Following incubation with 50, 100 or 500 U/ml TNF-\u03b1, CCL7 was still produced at higher levels than any other chemokine on the array. Other monokines were expressed at significant levels, notably CCL2, CCL4, CCL5 and CCL11. Relative mRNA levels (compared with housekeeping genes) of genes of interest are shown in Table 1 . CCL7 expression was visible weakly in many astrocytes in culture (A). Stimulation with TNF-\u03b1 increased the amounts of CCL7 detected slightly, with a characteristic punctate vacuolar distribution (B). This was augmented further when the cells were incubated with brefeldin A (C) or with TNF-\u03b1 and brefeldin A (D), indicating that CCL7 is constitutively produced and released from cells, but that the rate of production can be increased by proinflammatory stimulus (demonstrated in graph E).",
