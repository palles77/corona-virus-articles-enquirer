SARS-CoV-2 can result in heart dysfunction due to the intensively expressed ACE2 in the patients' myocardial cells that act as receptors for this virus. Therefore, it is beneficial to patients that plasma K + levels be frequently checked and maintained between 4.0 and 5.5 mmol/L or 4.5 and 5.5 mmol/L for serum K + as serum generally has more K+ than plasma 12 . In the present study, hypokalemia was prevailing among the patients with COVID-19, up to 62% (108/175) patients having plasma K + that was under 3 mmol/L. Among 175 patients, only 10 patients had plasma K + of 4 mmol/L recommended for patients with myocardial dysfunction. That strikingly low prevalence of optimal concentration of plasma K + implied a massive risk for the patients' heart to be affected by both hypokalemia and the virus. As an emerging infectious disease, the available data on serum K + levels is scanty. Only one previous study on 41 patients reported 4.2 mmol/L as the mean serum K + , as well as higher K + in the ICU patients (mean, 4.6 important indices for hypokalemia, myocardial injury, and evaluation of disease.

In the current situation, two probable causes of hypokalemia are increased gastrointestinal loss and increased urinary loss 15 . Both causes can find their way in the patients with COVID-19, as mentioned in the introduction section. However, the present findings indicated that gastrointestinal loss might not contribute much to hypokalemia as based on the following reasons: only a small proportion of patients with hypokalemia showing gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g., 31% of patients with severe hypokalemia having diarrhea; among the patients with hypokalemia, no significant difference between those with and those without diarrhea; the average number of diarrhea onsets being 5 times/day and diarrhea ending in a short time, meaning that the diarrhea was mild. Therefore, hypokalemia might principally result from increased urine loss. This was proved in this study by the dramatically increased urine K + output in the hypokalemia group than the control group with normokalemia. This finding that increased urine K + was the primary cause of hypokalemia was consistent with the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. This virus drives RAS towards enhanced ACE-Ang II (angiotensin II)-Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1) axis by degrading ACE2 that is the principal counter-regulatory mechanism for the central axis of the RAS 4 . The final effect of this disturbance of RAS is the increased distal delivery of sodium and water All rights reserved.

However, the mechanism of hypokalemia in the present study hinted that it was challenging to achieve normokalemia in the presence of continuous renal loss of K + . This worry was proved by the elevated amount of urine K + measured in umol/gram of creatinine ( Figure 1 ). The continual K + supplements had very little effect on the return of normokalemia when the urine loss of K + persisted in the severe cases. Interestingly, we found a noteworthy phenomenon in most patients who were cured of COVID-19. As shown in Figure 1 , when patients were inclined to recovery, they responded well to K + supplement treatment and steadily returned to normokalemia. This phenomenon indicated the end of urine loss of K + due to disordered RAS balance; in other words, the ACE2 function began to return. This exciting finding suggested that return of normokalemia might be a reliable biomarker for monitoring ACE2 function.",
