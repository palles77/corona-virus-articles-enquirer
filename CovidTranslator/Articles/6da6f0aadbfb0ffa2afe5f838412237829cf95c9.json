Active RFID readers communicate with the tags continuously and automatically to keep track of the real-time information about the locations of the tagged objects. The data regarding the locations and other transmitted information are stored in the ward management system. This platform enables capabilities of real-time monitoring and tracking of individuals and assets, reporting of ward statistics, and providing intelligence and analytics for hospital ward management. All of these capabilities benefit hospital ward management by enhanced patient safety, increased operational efficiency and throughput, and mitigation of risk of infectious disease widespread. A prototype developed based on our proposed architecture of the platform was tested in a pilot study, which was conducted in two medical wards of the intensive care unit of one of the largest public general hospitals in Hong Kong. This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of the implementation of this RFIDenabled platform for practical use in hospital wards. Furthermore, the data collected from the pilot study are used to provide data analytics for hospital ward management.",

Big data analytics not only supports businesses and commercial organizations to create further profits, but also helps governments and public sectors with providing high-quality services to citizens, and consequently benefits the populations by enhancing the quality of life. Although many sectors like retail and banking have already embraced big data for many years, the healthcare industry has lagged behind them due to several reasons, such as medical service providers' resistance to change, underinvestment in information technology because of uncertain returns, security issues, and patient privacy concerns (Groves et al. 2013; Kayyali et al. 2013) . While there are various barriers to utilize big data in the healthcare industry, without a doubt big data can substantially benefit the healthcare stakeholders, for instance, by conducting comparative effectiveness research, developing clinical decision support systems, remotely monitoring patients, promoting personalized medicine, and analyzing disease patterns (Manyika et al. 2011) . In this paper, we present a platform, which is based on radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology, for hospital ward management. With a prototype developed based on the architecture of this platform, a pilot study was then conducted in two medical wards of the intensive care unit of one of the largest public general hospitals in Hong Kong to demonstrate the feasibility of its practical use.",

            "text": "Prior to the introduction of RFID technology to the healthcare industry, healthcare facilities had to keep track of patients and valuable assets manually, or by the use of barcoding; the adoption of RFID in healthcare management has facilitated those practices. RFID has advantages over barcodes; barcodes have to be scanned manually one at a time within the line of sight of the reader, while multiple RFID tags, even if they are covered by some other objects, can be detected automatically and simultaneously by an RFID reader, whose read range is longer than the read ranges of barcode scanners. This automated process can save labor hours for performing some hospital routine tasks. The time saved from these non-value-added activities can help to reduce operational costs, or be transferred to provide additional professional services that can benefit patients. RFID not only reduces healthcare expense, but also facilitates automating and streamlining patient identification processes in healthcare operations (Chowdhury and Khosla 2007) . The identification processes can help to reduce medical errors and mitigate patient risk. Overall, those healthcare facilities which had implemented RFID believed that the technology has more advantages than disadvantages (Reyes et al. 2012 ).",

            "text": "Our work was motivated by the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Hong Kong. In the incident, a significant number of individuals, including patients and hospital staff, were infected with SARS within a hospital. A project team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) considered the deployment of RFID technologies to trace the physical contacts of individuals within the wards in case of an infectious disease outbreak, in order to immediately and effectively isolate potentially infected individuals to mitigate the risk of disease widespread. Although many healthcare professionals around the world have put enormous efforts into avoiding cross-infection among people in healthcare facilities since the SARS outbreak in 2003, risk mitigation of infectious disease in healthcare settings appears to be not very effective. It is not uncommon that individuals working in or visiting a healthcare unit are infected by some disease carriers. For example, the recent outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in South Korea, where most of the infections took place in health facilities (BBC News 2015) , has again raised public worry about the spread of infectious disease in healthcare settings and has further affirmed the importance of tracing physical contacts between individuals in order to quickly and effectively isolate individuals suspected of carrying MERS. The goal of the project presented in this paper is to develop a platform that enables traceability of individuals in healthcare settings. In addition to the traceability, our proposed platform also benefits the healthcare stakeholders by enhanced patient care, and increased operational efficiency and throughput.",

RFID applications not only have practical contributions to optimizing operations in business and public sectors, but also have research values; in particular, academic journals in the field of operations and processes management such as Production and Operations Management, International Journal of Production Economics, and International Journal of Production Research devoted special issues to papers of real-life RFID applications (Dutta and Whang 2007; Ngai 2010) . For overall RFID applications, literature review, and future research, we refer the reader to Chao et al. (2007) , , Liao et al. (2011) and Zhu et al. (2012) . Although RFID technology has been widely applied in many industries, its adoption in the healthcare industry is still far behind from others due to various reasons, such as long payback periods, the need to modify the existing processes, the lack of applicable standards (Reiner and Sullivan 2005) , and privacy and security concerns (Rosenbaum 2014) .

            "text": "There have been various successful RFID-enabled applications in the healthcare industry. A major proportion of work deployed RFID to reduce medical mistakes or errors, which aims to improve patient safety. Medical mistakes are the third leading cause of death in the United States (Hospital Safety Score 2013) and are estimated to cause 440,000 preventable deaths of patients (James 2013) . Among all kinds of medical errors, misidentification is a major source (Yao et al. 2012) . Positive patient identification (Aguilar et al. 2006) , which requires each patient to wear a RFID wristband that contains the patient demographic information, has been proposed to provide a solution for reducing those errors due to patient misidentification. Dalton and Rossini (2005) used RFID technologies to avoid blood transfusion errors. The staff members of the blood donation centre used RFID readers to scan the RFID wristbands of patients and checked with their PDAs if the information is identical with the blood bag tag. Fuhrer and Guinard (2006) developed a web-based application, which is called the RFIDLocator, to track and locate patients. The system made sure that the correct operation is performed on the right patient at the right operating theater. Yen et al. (2012) proposed two RFID-based solutions to reduce inpatient medical errors by nurses. An offline solution was proposed for the use in a hospital environment that does not support wireless communication. The nurses had to download the latest inpatient's prescription records from the system at the nurse station to their PDAs before visiting their patients, and to upload the their drug administration records from their PDAs to the system after their visits. An online solution was proposed for the use in an environment that wireless communication is enabled, so that the nurses could download and upload realtime drug administration information from and to the system at any moment. For both solutions, the nurses used their PDAs, which were equipped with an RFID reader, to read the RFID tags in the wristbands of the patients and in the corresponding unit-dose packages to eliminate medication errors during drug administration tasks.",

            "text": "3 An RFID-enabled platform for high-quality inpatient care and risk mitigation in hospital wards RIFD is a technology that uses electromagnetic fields to transfer data. The purposes of RFID are mainly to automatically identify objects and keep track of their locations over time. An RFID-enabled application consists of two components of hardware-tags and readers-and a middleware. An RFID tag contains electronically stored information, such as its unique tag serial number and object-related information, and is attached to an object (products, assets, and even individuals), when in use. Information stored on a tag can be updated, or locked. RFID tags can be active or passive. An active tag requires internal battery to power the tag and transmits signal periodically, while a passive tag has no internal battery and relies on the radio energy transmitted by an RFID reader to power the tag. Therefore, passive RFID requires stronger signal strength, compared to the signal strength to operate active tags. In general, active RFID has a longer read range (i.e., the range that a tag and a reader can communicate) than passive RFID (more than 100 meters for active RFID; around 3 meters for passive RFID), but is more expensive (USD 15 to 100 for an active RFID tag; USD 0.15 to 5 for a passive RFID tag) (Jovix 2015) . Passive RFID is mainly used for identification, while active RFID is mostly applied to track objects. The principle of RFID can be briefly described as follows. When a tagged object falls within the read range of a reader, the reader will transmit an encoded radio signal to interrogate the tag of the object. After the tag receives the signal, it will transmit an identifier and some other specific information, depending on the application, to the reader. The reader will then deliver the information to the middleware. In most applications the middleware is integrated with the legacy computer system of the application. The transmitted information is delivered from the middleware to the computer. The system will then create a unique ID and a timestamp for this record and store the transmitted information. Users can therefore retrieve the up-to-the-minute information, e.g., locations, regarding the tagged objects from the computer system. RFID data stored in the computer system can also be analyzed offline. For example, aggregating all the observations transmitted over time, the computer system can help to trace the location of any tagged object at any time. This helps to obtain the information about ''who or what is where, and when''.",

The middleware can be integrated with the legacy ward management system of the hospital so that ward staff are able to retrieve real-time information related to all objects in wards to facilitate operations. We use active RFID technology for continuous tracking purposes. Active RFID tags are attached to the objects in the hospital wards. In addition to patients, the tagged objects also include ward staff and medical equipment, which empowers additional capabilities and allows us to generate further insights into the interactions among the three categories of objects. Each object is registered in the computer system and is given a unique ID which makes each of them identifiable. Patient personal information (name, gender, age, etc.) and case history are also available in the ward management system so that hospital staff can retrieve the information whenever necessary. This application of RFID technologies can also eliminate the traditional physical constraint that patients' health monitoring devices must be physically connected to the hospital legacy system to transmit patients' health-related data. Due to the recent technological advancement, these health monitoring devices have become smaller and lighter so that they are portable and wearable. For example, Microsoft Band is a light wristband with multiple sensors installed and has the capabilities of continuously monitoring heart rate, body movement, skin temperature, and galvanic skin response. Such wearable health monitoring sensors can be connected to an RFID tag to establish linkage for health-related data transfer. Once data about health status have been transmitted from the sensors to the RFID tag, all real-time information regarding the corresponding patient (e.g., location and health status) can be sent from the tags to the readers via radio frequency data communication continuously. The real-time information is then delivered from the readers, via the middleware, to the ward management system for processing and storing the data. From the ward management system, ward staff would be able to locate each objects on the map at any moment, and monitor the health statuses of patients. For offline use, the stored data can also be used to report ward statistics and provide insights, intelligence, and analytics to hospital administrators for future planning. Figure 1 depicts the flow of our proposed RFID-enabled platform. Our proposed platform can facilitate hospital ward management at both operational and analytical levels by the capabilities of real-time monitoring and tracking of individuals and assets, reporting of ward statistics, and providing intelligence and analytics. Below we describe the benefits of our proposed RFID-enabled platform to the healthcare stakeholders. Fig. 1 The major components of the RFID-enabled platform and its flow",

Furthermore, the data collected in the system related to staff and equipment activities in the wards can provide hospital administrators with insights into manpower and resource planning. The data can reflect the usage durations for different classes of staff and equipment. Hospital administrators can therefore calculate the utilizations of different types of resources, identify scarce resources, and determine their optimal levels for future use. Hospital administrators can also look at the activities of ward staff at different time periods on different days of the week to determine a better work-shift schedule. At an operational level, the capability of asset tracking prevents theft losses of valuable medical equipment.",

The locations that patients visited at every moment were recorded in the ward management system. In case of an infectious disease outbreak within the hospital, the hospital management can quickly trace back the person-to-person physical contacts by retrieving, from the ward management system, the data about the locations and times that the (confirmed and suspected) disease carriers visited in the incubation period and a list of individuals who visited the same locations at the same times. This provides a way such that the hospital can promptly and effectively isolate those potentially infected individuals to mitigate the risk of disease widespread. Furthermore, the traceability also enables the hospital to figure out the spreading paths and source of infection, which is exceedingly helpful for infectious disease control. In most of the RFID applications in the healthcare domain, tags are attached to patients or hospital assets; hospital staff are rarely tagged objects. In our proposed platform, hospital staff are also tagged because they can also be infected by disease carriers within the hospital when providing medical cares.",

Before WHO announced the outbreak of this deadly disease and placed a high alert on the situation, the hospital management of PWH had already suspected that there was a communicable disease outbreak within the hospital when eleven medical staff members working in the same ward reported sick leave simultaneously. Although PWH had eventually identified the index case-patient and then immediately isolated this patient and other infected carriers, a total of 239 individuals, including medical staff, students, patients, and visitors, were cross-infected with SARS in PWH due to the unawareness of this previously unknown disease when this patient was admitted (SARS Expert Committee of Hong Kong SAR Government 2003). After the outbreak of SARS, a project team from the CUHK considered the feasibility of using RFID technology to enable traceability for person-to-person physical contacts in order to provide immediate response to the widespread of infectious diseases and better risk management within hospital wards. In case of confirmed or suspected cases of infection, the hospital management can easily and quickly trace back the contacts between people in the wards, by retrieving the data about the locations the infected patients had visited and listing the individuals who visited those places at the same times, from the ward management system. Healthcare-associated infection, i.e., infection acquired in healthcare facilities, is not a rare incidence that only took place during the outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong, but the most frequent adverse event in healthcare delivery systems all over the world (WHO 2013) . Infectious disease outbreak by cross-infection among individuals in health facilities is also a kind of healthcare-associated infection. Such cross-infection can be difficult to prevent as carriers of some deadly infectious disease may only show mild symptoms (such as fever, cough, and muscle pain) at an early stage after being infected so that medical staff are not able to identify these carriers and isolate them in the first place. The outbreaks of SARS in Hong Kong and MERS in South Korea are examples of cross-infection of deadly diseases among people in healthcare settings. Since an effective and prompt isolation of potentially infected individuals can substantially mitigate disease widespread, the project team of CUHK aimed to apply advanced technology to facilitate the isolation procedure.",

In order to effectively and Fig. 3 The front and back of an active RFID tag that was used in the implementation promptly identify and isolate the high-risk groups of people that had contacted the carrier, a system that can trace the physical contacts associated with this patient will be exceedingly helpful. Our platform is able to report person-to-person physical contacts. A user can define a person-to-person physical contact.The user has to specify how close two individuals were and how long they were together to constitute a physical contact. For example, the user can define a physical contact between two individuals if the two individuals were staying together continuously for 5 s with their distance less than 1 meter. With the user's definition of person-toperson physical contacts, the platform is able to list all pairs of individuals that had contacts. This person-to-person physical contact relationship can be reported using a network diagram, where a node represents an individual and an edge represents a physical contact between them . Figure 6a shows a network diagram which represents the person-to-person physical contacts. The node size and edge size are proportional to the number of individuals that the represented person contacted in the ward and total contact time between them.

This data visualization technique can enable the hospital management very quickly to trace back whom the patient has contacted physically and identify high-risk contact groups, e.g., the individuals that have a significant duration of physical contacts with the carriers or have contacted a number of carriers. The times and durations that the physical contacts have taken place are also stored in the system for more detailed risk analysis.",

Although there have been various applications of big data for healthcare use, the healthcare industry is still lagging behind other industries such as retail and banking. This indicates that there is a need to further promote big data in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we presented an active RFID-enabled platform to keep track of the locations of patients, ward staff, and medical equipment, for hospital ward management. The platform empowers real-time monitoring and tracking of objects, reporting of ward statistics, and providing intelligence and analytics. A distinctive feature of our proposed platform is that, all the individuals, including ward staff, are tagged and their locations are tracked continuously. This enables the traceability of person-to-person physical contacts in case of an infectious disease outbreak so as to provide immediate and effective response to mitigate risk of disease widespread within the hospital. A pilot study which deployed a prototype developed based on our proposed architecture of the platform was conducted in two medical wards of the intensive care unit of one of the largest public general hospitals in Hong Kong. Although the pilot study demonstrated its feasibility for practical use, we also report some of the human issues that obstruct its adoption and implementation, which are beyond the technical challenges that researchers and engineers can handle. Furthermore, installation of a RFID-network can be costly due to the infrastructure (e.g., active RFID readers, wiring, and some construction work) and the development of a middleware so that hospital management may hesitate to adopt the technology. Nevertheless, these costs are mostly one-time initial set-up costs, because the tagged wristbands can be reused, while the maintenance cost is relatively lower. The hospital also further benefits from cost saving by preventing valuable medical equipment being stolen [e.g., the price of a cardiac monitor ranges from a hundred to several thousand US dollars according to Alibaba.com (2015) ]",
