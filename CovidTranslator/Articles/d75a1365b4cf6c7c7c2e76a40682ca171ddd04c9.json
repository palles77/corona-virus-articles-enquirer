            "text": "Development of the mammary gland requires the coordinated action of proteolytic enzymes during two phases of remodelling. Firstly, new ducts and side-branches thereof need to be established during pregnancy to generate an extensive ductal tree allowing the secretion and transport of milk. A second wave of remodelling occurs during mammary involution after weaning. We have analysed the role of the cell surface protease aminopeptidase N (Anpep, APN, CD13) during these processes using Anpep deficient and Anpep over-expressing mice. We find that APN deficiency significantly delays mammary gland morphogenesis during gestation. The defect is characterised by a reduction in alveolar buds and duct branching at mid-pregnancy. Conversely over-expression of Anpep leads to accelerated ductal development. This indicates that Anpep plays a critical role in the proteolytic remodelling of mammary tissue during adult mammary development.",

During pregnancy, the epithelial compartment of the gland is vastly expanded (Benaud et al. 1998) . At the end of lactation the epithelial cells undergo apoptosis, and adipocyte differentiation is induced (Lilla et al. 2002) . Ductal and alveolar growth during puberty and pregnancy, and the involution process require the action of proteolytic enzymes (including matrix metallo-proteinases, plasminogen and membrane-peptidases) and the corresponding genes are activated during these periods (Benaud et al. 1998; Alexander et al. 2001) . Matrix metallo-proteinases (MMPs) are expressed in several cell types of the mammary gland including stromal fibroblasts (e.g. MMP3, MMP2), epithelial cells (e.g. MMP7 or MMP9), adipocytes (e.g. MMP2) and lymphoid cells (e.g. MMP9) (Crawford and Matrisian 1996; Lund et al. 1996; Wiseman et al. 2003) .

Proteolytic enzymes are induced during the second phase of involution suggesting that their expression is a consequence of epithelial cell apoptosis rather than a pre-requisite. Nevertheless, matrix-interactions provide survival signals to the mammary epithelium, such that removal of these signals can enhance apoptosis (Farrelly et al. 1999; Gilmore et al. 2000) . Proteolytic breakdown products of matrix components like fibronectin can induce apoptosis in some mammary cell lines (Schedin et al. 2000) . Proteinase activity may therefore accelerate the apoptosis of the epithelium, whilst stimulating differentiation of adipocytes via matrix remodelling (Alexander et al. 2001) .",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (Anpep, APN) is a cell surface protease which has been implicated in a variety of roles in mammals. It is expressed highly in a variety of tissues including gut, mononuclear blood cells, lung, brain and others. Its expression is elevated during inflammatory processes and during tumorigenesis. It also acts as a receptor for type II coronaviruses (Yeager et al. 1992; Delmas et al. 1994) and (in case of the human Anpep) human cytomegalovirus. Experiments carried out in vitro and in Anpep deficient mice (allele description: Anpep\\tm1Sid[) have demonstrated a critical role for Anpep in neo-vascularisation (Guzman-Rojas et al. 2012; Rangel et al. 2007b; Bhagwat et al. 2001) . In contrast, Anpep has been shown to be dispensable for normal haematopoiesis and myeloid cell function in mice (allele description: Anpep\\tm1.1Lsha[) (Winnicka et al. 2010 ). In the mammary gland Anpep is expressed with a similar pattern as other proteolytic enzymes in that its expression is high during pregnancy and involution and low during lactation (Sorrell et al. 2005) . We therefore speculated that Anpep may also play a role during mammary gland development and have addressed this question using mice deficient in Anpep and transgenic mice over-expressing Anpep (Lassnig et al. 2005) . We find that Anpep deficiency significantly impairs the formation of side branches of mammary ducts during pregnancy. Over-expression of Anpep, in contrast, enhances ductal side-branching during pregnancy. These data demonstrate that Anpep plays an important role in the proteolytic remodelling during the mammary development cycle.",

The first exon remains intact; however potential transcripts fusing exon 1 to exon 10 will lead to a frameshift and the generation of a stop codon in the second codon of exon 10, thereby leading to a truncated protein containing the first 207 amino acids of the Anpep protein (whereas the full length protein consists of 967 amino acid).",

The primer pair mAPN14/PGK5 gives rise to a 1,507 bp fragment from a targeted Anpep allele. The targeting frequency was 2.9 % (7 targeted ES cell clones in 240 clones analysed). Southern blot analysis was carried out as described (Kolb and Siddell 1997) . The knock-out mice were generated by Genoway (Lyon, France) using their standard protocols. The targeting construct was transfected into SV129 derived ES cells and positive cell clones (as identified by PCR analysis) were transferred into C57BL/6J hosts. The new mutant Anpep allele will be referred to as Anpep\\tm1Afk[. Chimeric mice were bred onto a C57BL/6J background to derive animals which transmit the mutant allele through the germline. These founder mice were then transferred to the mouse facility at the Roslin Institute and maintained in accordance with UK Home Office regulations. The mice were maintained on a C57BL/6J background. The phenotype documented in this paper was observed after 3, 7 and 10 generations of breeding onto the C57BL/6J background. The Anpep over-expressing mice were described before (Lassnig et al. 2005 ).",

Expression of Anpep was assessed in Anpep knock-out and control mice using RT-PCR on RNA isolated from small intestine tissue of two Anpep knock-out mice and two control mice. As expected the PCR product indicative of Anpep expression was lost in the Anpep knock-out mice, whereas a PCR product indicative of b-actin was detectable in all mice (Fig. 3b) .

Significant amounts of Anpep are detectable in kidney and small intestine of wild-type mice. Heterozygous mice show a reduced amount of Anpep expression, whereas no Anpep expression is detectable in Anpep knock-out mice.

There is a high degree of redundancy among the multitude of proteolytic enzymes and no single deficiency is able to completely abrogate mammary gland development. Human Anpep has been detected in intra-and interlobular fibroblasts and on the apical surface of some luminal epithelial cells in the human breast (Atherton et al. 1992) . It is also expressed throughout most developmental phases (Atherton et al. 1994a ) and can be found on fibroblast explants from human breast (Atherton et al. 1994b ). To our knowledge murine Anpep has not been detected successfully in mammary tissue by immuno-histochemistry. This may be due to the fact that most antibodies against Anpep recognise highly variable glycosylation patterns which vary between different tissues. We were able to detect murine Anpep in intestinal tissue, but an identical protocol did not generate Anpep specific signals in the mammary gland.",

The defect detected in Anpep deficient animals is similar to that seen in MMP3 deficient mice, in that the invasion of the terminal endbuds through the stroma is not impaired, but the formation of secondary branches is significantly affected (Wiseman et al. 2003) . Furthermore the over-expression of Anpep in the mammary gland leads to an increase in side-branching and a precocious development of the mammary ductal tree; again a phenotype which is similar to the one observed in mice over-expressing MMP3 in the mammary gland (Sternlicht et al. 1999; Witty et al. 1995) . This raises the question as to whether Anpep has a role to play in activating MMP3. However, Anpep as an exopeptidase typically cleaves neutral N-terminal amino acids from target proteins, whereas activation of MMP3 is more likely mediated by an endo-peptidase-like agent (Page-McCaw et al. 2007 ). However as the in vivo activator of MMP3 is yet to be unequivocally defined [although plasmin has been suggested as a potential activator (Fu et al. 2001) ] it is possible that Anpep might activate MMP3 via an indirect mechanism.",

These results are also consistent with our finding that at day 18 of gestation and during lactation no significant differences between whole mounts of wild-type and Anpep deficient mice can be detected (data not shown). At these stages the whole mammary tissue is filled with epithelial cells. Expression of the Anpep gene is sustained slightly longer than that of MMP3, as has been demonstrated in three different micro-array analyses of mouse mammary development (Master et al. 2002; Stein et al. 2004; Clarkson et al. 2004 ). However the relative contribution of Anpep to duct formation amongst a significant number of other proteolytic enzymes may be more critical at earlier stages of gestation (Sorrell et al. 2005) .

            "text": "Anpep plays an important role in angiogenesis (Rangel et al. 2007b) . In that context Anpep was shown to be essential for the invasion of endothelium into stromal tissue or an implanted extra-cellular matrix plug. There are similarities between angiogenesis and mammary morphogenesis (Friedl and Gilmour 2009 ). However, whether the deficiency of angiogenesis and mammary branching morphogenesis in Anpep deficient mice derive from the same molecular events is unclear. Intriguingly, angiogenesis in the mammary gland has also been shown to impact on gland development and lactational performance in mice. This has been demonstrated using mice carrying a tissue-specific inactivation of the VEGF gene in the mammary gland (Rossiter et al. 2007 ). However the most significant role of VEGF appears to occur during late pregnancy and early lactation. In contrast the effect of Anpep deficiency is most pronounced in midlactation suggesting that the proteolytic activity of Anpep rather than its angiogenic role have a major impact on mammary morphogenesis. However, recent findings in tumor allograft models have demonstrated a role for Anpep in tumor tissue and surrounding stromal tissue (Guzman-Rojas et al. 2012) , suggesting that Anpep may fulfil more than one function in tissue development.",

The positions of the primer combinations used for the PCR genotyping are indicated as arrows; the sizes of the expected PCR products are shown in square brackets. The probes used for Southern blot analysis are shown as green boxes. The expected fragments hybridising with these probes are shown as green lines. b PCR analysis of genomic DNA derived from one of the targeted cell clones and the parental HM1 ES cells. 100 ng of genomic DNA were amplified using the primer combination mAPN14, mAPN15R and PGK5. The 1,687 bp product is indicative of the unmodified APN gene, whereas the 1,509 bp product indicates a successful targeting event at the APN gene. The PCR reactions were separated on a 2 % agarose gel and the products visualised by staining with ethidium bromide. Phage k DNA digested with HindIII and EcoRI was used as marker. c PCR analysis of genomic DNA derived from transgenic mice. 100 ng of genomic DNA were amplified using the primer combination mAPN10, mAPN15R and PGK5. The 801 bp product is indicative of the unmodified APN gene, whereas the 623 bp product indicates a successful targeting event at the APN gene. d Southern blot analysis of the 5 0 end of the APN gene. BglII digested genomic DNA was analysed using the probe indicated in a. The 5.1 kb band is indicative of a targeted APN gene, the 4 kb band is indicative of the unmodified APN gene. e Southern blot of the 3 0 end of the APN gene. SalI/BstEII digested DNA was analysed using the probe indicated in a. The 12.4 kb band is indicative of a targeted APN gene, the 13.7 kb band is indicative of the unmodified APN gene.
