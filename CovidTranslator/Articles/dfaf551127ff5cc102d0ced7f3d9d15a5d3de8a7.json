The effectiveness of these initiatives depends on the effectiveness of regional and international cooperation on health challenges and issues. [1] There are, however, little substantive information and knowledge gaps on how international cooperation and activities can best be used as tools for the management of global health and attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). [1, 2] China-Africa heath development initiatives is timely to address public health and health research gaps, South-South health development platforms and cooperation in shaping innovative national health evidence policies, priorities, programs and benefits in developing countries. International bilateral or multilateral cooperation on health development has been evolving rapidly since the late twentieth century to meet the increasing needs of vulnerable populations, moving forward effective Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and SDGs. [2, 3] In addition, to face the challenges of health and epidemiologic transitions, ageing and globalization challenges, collaborative diplomacy on health security have become more vital than ever in not only saving lives and improving public health but also in improving and providing long lasting benefits to both world's poorest and developed countries. At the same time, however, the rising concern on response and funding from international health actors (WHO, World Bank, UN/UNDP, etc.) remains challenging and requires more efforts and collaboration in harmonizing multilateral efforts and timely actions in emergencies situations. [4, 5] While the news have often reported on the growth of Chinese involvement in Africa, there has been very little literature on its effects on public health. There is a need for deeper analysis on China's cooperation and efforts at improving public health large-scale development in Africa. There are no statistics showing declines in mortality or disease burden. Furthermore, it's still unclear exactly how the Chinese approach differs from the Western approach, as the difference between the \"horizontal\" and \"vertical\" approaches are never described practically or operationally. [3, 4, 6] Moreover, there is an urgent need to understand factors that can promote mutual and beneficial health development initiatives. [2, 3] The growing trend and quest for Chinese multilateral cooperation is increasingly paramount and imperative in tackling the persistent global financial crisis, reducing mass unemployment, and revamping the public burden of infectious diseases of poverty. [4, 5] Strategic and timely China-Africa health development cooperation is much needed in training and capacity development, exchanges, technical assistance and technology transfer. Also, strengthening health systems in scaling up health and medical skills transfer to achieve universal coverage, health equity and overall long-term benefits of improved quality healthcare delivery towards sustainable national development and growth. [2, 3, 6] Reciprocally, to support China in meeting up with the growing demand on natural resources and citizenry needs, international laws and declarations are critical areas for international cooperation. The current political environment and commitment to address health problems has created unprecedented opportunities for bilateral health cooperation. [4, 5] Furthermore, as China has become an increasingly important part of global health over the past decades, interest in China's international health cooperation has increased among public health professionals internationally and in China. [3, 5, 6] Thus, this systematic analysis of China-Africa cooperation is timely in leveraging on infectious diseases and poverty alleviation health experiences and lessons learned in reshaping strategic health diplomacy formulation and enhancing successful approaches in health programs and networks in Africa. [5, 7] The importance of international, multilateral cooperation for health and disease prevention and control has been recognized as a vital approach and instrument in global health agenda. However, there is a dearth of literature on the potential impact of China strategic diplomacy and policy approaches on the global health inter-dependence, focusing mainly on aspects of existing and emerging threats from disease prevention and control to elimination programs and strategies. [6, 8] Few scholarly publications have paid attention to the behavior and politics of global actors. Primarily, how China-Africa health development will shape the global health priorities cooperation and collaboration requires further investigation. [4] [5] [6] [7] In China, there exists a few articles regarding international cooperation on health concerns aspects of social science. [2, 6, 7] To address the operational and translation research to health policy and practice gaps, challenges and opportunities, more systematic analyses might be required in further understanding the importance of strategic and comprehensive engagement. [4, 7, 8] Jointly and mutually beneficial Africa-China heath development initiatives could be the turning point for collaborative support and research projects, resource sharing and analysis for new public health policy dimensions and strategic impact. Programmatic and robust partnerships are paramount in fostering context health and sustainable public health innovations for health information for all generations. It will, in turn, impact on communities and populations, fostering efficient and effective global health initiatives towards enhanced economic trade, growth and stability, promoting the course of human rights and equity, reinforcement of environmental and wildlife protection and regulations, access and use of health services and medical commodities in achieving UHC and mainstreaming of the SDGs. [8, 9] This review paper examines the implications of China engagement in global health initiatives in Africa particularly as it relates to the benefits in health systems strengthening and innovations, emerging epidemics and infectious diseases of poverty initiatives prevention, control and elimination. It seeks an understanding of the drivers and operational enhancers that can promote innovative health development initiatives necessary for reliable and quality data for evidencebased contextual policy, priorities and programs of global health impact.",

The paradigm shift in the Chinese global health is one of the most important geopolitical cooperation of our time. China's initiative at promoting peace and social justice enhanced the pace of Chinese participation in helping African countries resolve conflicts. Hence, the Chinese government continues to work and support the international partnership and collaboration with African Union in safeguarding peace and stability in Africa, promoting the development of Africa, and advancing the integration process of Africa. The Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), continues to deepen the new type of China-Africa strategic partnership by advancing economic and trade cooperation, and actively exploring a common path that reflects both China's and Africa's realities in reducing the major causes of emerging threats and diseases in these countries.",

For example, the West Africa's Ebola outbreak that affected Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea witnessed the importance of China partnership in fighting Ebola, and the needs for economic and social reconstruction in the post-Ebola period. The Chinese government worked with international community, humanitarian agencies and frontline non-governmental organizations including African countries to contain and control Ebola epidemics in West Africa. Compared to other developed countries, China provided a robust technical and non-technical assistance to 13 countries in and around the affected West Africa sub-region valued at about $120 million (USD), and pledged an extra $5 million (USD) to the UN Response Multi-partner Trust Fund to support recovery and rehabilitation process of the affected countries. In addition, China also provided logistics in major affected provinces, including the supply and free distribution of Ebola protection kits, mobile laboratory testing vehicles and building new national Ebola research laboratories. Also skills development of over 13,000 health workers and health professional were improved through training and capacity development. There was also post-Ebola recovery and reconstruction plans and assistance in social and economic development projects in the most affected countries namely Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.",

Its theme was Promoting the Availability of Healthcare Service in Africa in improving China-Africa's Cooperation in Public Health in Post-Ebola Era. There were more than 200 participants, including the health ministers of China and over 40 African countries, as well as representatives from the AU and international organizations such as the World Health Organization and UNAIDS. The meeting adopted the Cape Town Declaration and its implementation framework to promote China-Africa collaboration in public health. It developed a roadmap for China and African countries to work together to address the key health problems affecting the African continent. The latter Johannesburg Summit was the second summit since the inception of FOCAC 20 years ago and the first held in Africa. The timely conference resulted in upgrading new type of China-Africa relationship into a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. As a marked indication of this collaboration, China pledged to provide $60 billion (USD) funding support for 10 major China-Africa cooperation plans to be implemented in health-related challenges and issues. These ranged from addressing poor access and availability of quality and essential medicines and medical devices, weak health systems and capacity development, lack of entrepreneurship and technology transfer, unreliable and inexistent monitoring and evaluation (M&E) programs/projects.

In recent years, China has implemented measures adopted at the FOCAC ministerial conferences. China has actively developed cooperation with Africa in areas relating to public amenities, medical and health care, climate change and environmental protection, humanitarian aid, and other fields. China has also strengthened cultural and educational exchanges and scientific and technological cooperation in an effort to improve Africa's ability to develop independently. China has offered assistance to Africa in digging wells for water supplies, and in building affordable housing, broadcasting and telecommunications facilities, and cultural and educational sites in an effort to improve the productive and living conditions of local people. Since 2009, China has carried out dozens of welldigging projects in the Sudan, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Djibouti, Guinea and Togo, playing a positive role in easing water problems for local people. It has also provided support for the building of portable dwellings in South Sudan, schools in Benin, and rural schools in Malawi, and in doing so, improved local living conditions and educational facilities. China's largest aid project in the Central African Republic is the construction of the Boali No. 3 Hydropower Station, which, after it was completed 2010, greatly relieved electricity shortages in Bangui and surrounding areas with potential usefulness in improving data access and information sharing for public health benefits. Supporting cultural and educational exchanges make up an important part of the new type of strategic partnership between China and Africa. By supporting young Africans studying in China, sending young Chinese volunteers to Africa and developing joint research initiatives, China tries to promote mutual understanding between China and African countries and strengthening the social foundation of their friendship. Holding human resource training programs and courses are important components of capacity building. From 2010 to 2012, China held various training courses for 54 countries and regions in Africa; the courses involved a total of 27,318 officials and technicians, and covered topics relating to economics, foreign affairs, energy, industry, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishing, medicine and health care, inspection and quarantine, climate change, security, and some other fields. In addition, Chinese medical teams, agricultural experts and enterprises located in Africa have also trained local people in an effort to enhance local technological capabilities and upgrading China-Africa cooperation in science and technology. From 2010 to 2012, in advancing cooperation in medical and health care, China helped build 27 hospitals in Ghana, Zimbabwe and other African countries. China has also sent 43 medical teams to 42 African countries and regions, treating over 5.57 million patients. In recent years, in addition to building hospitals, donating drugs and organizing medical training programs, China has also launched an initiative called \"Brightness or \"Evidence\" Action,\" to treat cataract patients and provided mobile hospitals. China also built bilaterally-run eye centers, and helped build demonstration and training centers for diagnosis and treatment technologies, thereby effectively advancing Sino-African cooperation in medical and health care. China also gave 66 African researchers the chance to do post-doctoral research in China and donated 150,000 Yuan ($24,000) worth of research equipment to each of the 24 researchers who had returned to their home countries to work upon completing their joint research projects in China.",

[3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 21] Our findings documented that China's commitment to continuously support Africa in many areas include agriculture and health sector, trade and commerce, science and technology projects implementation. These included construction of regional and community hospitals and treatment centers, infrastructures and facilities to fight infectious diseases, support by Chinese medical care delivery teams and improve capacities to respond to public health and sanitary crises throughout Africa including DR Congo, Cameroon, Togo, Ivory Coast, Angola, Namibia, Mozambique, Sudan, Algeria, South Africa, Zambia, Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana, Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone. These equipped ultramodern infrastructure and facilities investment include emergency, resuscitation, pediatrics, surgery, obstetric and gynecology, medical imaging, and related technical units worth billions of US dollars (Figure 1 ). These joint efforts are positive milestones to strengthen intercontinental cooperation in view of attaining a sustainable impact in achieving universal health coverage and access to basic medicine. In particular, accelerating the fight against HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria, schistosomiasis, maternal-child health, reproductive health and improving universal immunization coverage against vaccine preventable diseases across Africa.

With the situation turning more serious and based on the needs of epidemic regions, China later announced three consecutive rounds of assistance. China has also promised that in so far as Ebola persists in Africa, her assistance will not stop. [7, 8, 10, 11, 15] China stood shoulder-to-shoulder with the African people in fighting Ebola to the final victory of global disease free generations. West Africa Ebola epidemics 2014-2016 led to net losses of $6.2 billion US dollars in the three most affected countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea) in terms of Gross Domestic Products (GDP). As these countries embark on recovery and reconstruction, China has promised assistance in health systems strengthening, capacity building, health infrastructures and equipment support, amongst others. [5, 8, 13, 23] The urgent need for data and information sharing, material and technical transfer cannot be over emphasized in improving public health and medical resources access through mutual commitments and support.

            "text": "The China-Africa Development Fund \"CAD-Fund\" is one of new methods for China-African new strategic partnership, which was fully controlled by the Chinese government. CAD Fund is one of the eight measures which was announced by Chinese government at the Beijing Summit of the FOCAC in November 4 th , 2006 aimed to support Chinese companies to develop the cooperation with Africa and enter the African market. [1, 3, 5] Distinctive characteristics in the capital nature, the business area, and operation mode is continually following the investment philosophy: to build up \"bridge linking\" and \"connection\" of the economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa; to enhance self-develop capability of Africa; to strictly fulfill the investment environment and social responsibility; to promote mutually beneficial and win-win between China and Africa by market-oriented operation. [5, 7, 21] CAD-Fund is a pioneering move in the process of mutual and beneficial China-Africa cooperation. It remedied the gap under the traditional model of free aid and loans. With the increasing African countries double public health burden (chronic illnesses and infectious diseases), new investment models and market-oriented economic development and operation should be examined in achieving sustained and healthy dual or self-development. [9, 11, 18] the direct investment is essential. Improving people's livelihood for African regions by additional large scale (e.g.: network project) investment to African countries could be beneficial in long terms. [14, 20] For instance, the Chinese government officially approved the establishment of the CAD-Fund, with first-phase funding, USD 1 billion, provided by China Development Bank. CAD-Fund operated independently based on market economy principles under a standardized corporate governance structure. China Development Bank (CDB), the shareholder, has a great wealth of experience in project review and management and is backed up with sound expert resources. Having invested in five funds and three specialized fund management companies, the bank has developed sophisticated fund management and risk control systems. CDB has accumulated profound experience vis-\u00e0-vis investing in Africa through its \"Going Global\" initiative. [19] [20] [21] CDB, by virtue of its overall resources and advantages, will provide a high level of professional support. Again, on the investment side, the Ministry of Commerce revealed that China's direct investment in Africa stood at $1.19 billion (USD) in the first half of 2014, falling over 40 percent year on year. The downturn is attributed to the sluggish global economic recovery, international commodity fluctuations, and the Ebola outbreaks. [8, 17, 21] Globalization and global health initiatives on infectious diseases of poverty associated consequences have shown the world is closely linked as emerging threats and epidemics of infectious diseases can strike anywhere at any time irrespective of race, religion and financial capacity of the country. These have precipitated growing opportunities in internationalization of south-south and south-north health cooperation in changing outcomes. [8, 9] The advances in technological development and increases in global interconnections are increasingly being utilized inexpensive and prompt health information communication diffusion broadly and interdependence between different people, regions and continent benefits. [8, 9] Improvements in communication and information technologies has enabled international responses to health threats and disaster crisis more rapidly and in a coordinated fashion, [7] bringing about greater sharing of information and increasing international interactions and collaboration. [10] Globalization requires increasing cooperation among countries to ensure the stability and security of the global system, a reason why implementation of international agreements and joint declarations has become important. [10, 21] For instance, industrial demand and globalization coupled with intense urbanization have been generating new ecological, climate and environmental threats and associated consequences beyond local, regional boundaries and worldwide. These consequences and issues have raised the need for international cooperation and foreign assistance agreements either as direct delivery of services, capacity transfer or implementation of health interventions such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. [5, 8, 10, 22] In today's more interdependent world, international cooperation, which involves the interaction of countries, international organizations and non-government actors, shapes values, policies and rules. As globalization continues to widen the gaps, development and implementation of comprehensive health models between developing and developed nations, the interest in global health partnership and foreign assistance effectiveness has grown in importance at improving funding on health systems priorities including scaling up access to essential medicines and service delivery, universal health coverage and building new primary healthcare facilities. [11, 18, 20, 21] International mutual cooperation and aid is one of the most effective weapons in reshaping and transforming regional and national health capabilities which benefits through provision of global public goods, infectious disease control and alleviation of poverty. [12, 23] The widespread influence of globalization has increased the need for international cooperation to address emerging opportunities for and threats to global health in improving the health status of populations in developing nations. [7, 9] As of November 2015, the majority of African exports to China remains in natural resources. According to the statistics by Chinese customs, crude oil, iron ore, diamonds, and agricultural products together accounted for 56.5 percent of Chinese imports from Africa during the first three quarters of 2015. And this number is on the low end because China's demand for raw materials has been suppressed by its economic slowdown this year. In this sense, China's intention of downplaying the importance of natural resources in Sino-Africa trade in its policy manifestation is clear, given the mutually understandable winwin image associated with Sino-Africa economic relations aspirations. China's International health development cooperation initiatives since the 1980s, health privatization and reforms expectations and outcomes from international coalitions were formed to address the heavy global challenges, including national burden of infectious diseases, poverty and inequality. With the global funds support from early 2000, the vertical approach to funding and aid has been gradually shifting to a horizontal approach and from mere bilateral efforts to multilateral organizations, local and international NGOs, aimed at reshaping major funding, cooperation, new alliances and networks. [10, 13] Furthermore, boosting provision of aid or humanitarian assistance paradigm shift from a small-scale task plan to large multiple programs financial support projects and programs.",

            "text": "multifaceted nature and complexity of health and the multi-sectorial interactions that influence it have induced an increasing number of organizations to become active in the health field. [2, 14] Broad-ranging partnerships are increasingly being set up to target specific health problems. [6, 15] For example, to achieve Roll Back Malaria or polio eradication a global partnership was formed with, among others, ministries of health in polio-endemic countries, Rotary International, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the governments of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. Reciprocally, from 1994 to 2001, the EU contributed \u20ac4.5 million to HIV/AIDS prevention in China, setting up six provincial level regional training centers to provide technical assistance to medical personnel in HIV/AIDS prevention. [14, 15] This collaborative support is advantageous for capacity building, educational exchanges between institutions of all levels and dual technology transfer. Such efforts have been reported between China and the United Kingdom (UK), the US, and Australia in research and development and helpful in solving health issues and developmental challenges including climate changes and globalization of trade and travel. [8, 11, 16] Previously, the establishment of cooperation between China and other countries has been done through the signing of agreements and regular corporate communication. Contemporary advances in implementation mechanisms are performed by joint engagement and participation in mutual win-win partnership and joint health programs funding or investment seeking based on local and national priorities and real time field interventions. [17, 19] Furthermore, China has dispatched more than 50 medical teams and more than 1,000 medical personnel to 39 African countries. Chinese governments highly valued and appraised local people and the team's devotion, willingly and generosity in providing medical services, training and technical assistance, in strengthening health systems development through FOCAC partnership. [3, 6, 9] In contrast to previous international vertical health approach, Chinese horizontal approach and process (people-people approach and relations) has been appraised in responding to the need of the populations. There is an urgent need for reliable and effective evidence in strengthening health systems development including constructing health care facilities, providing medicines and medical equipment, improving more targeted care access and utilization require contextual and scalable community-based programs and activities beneficial to both Chinese and African citizenry. [1, 3, 7, 14, 15] China's importance in sustainable development and global health goals, is aimed not only in fighting poverty and health inequality among the world's people, but in enhancing opportunities to live a free, healthy and fulfilled life. [1, 2, 18] Achieving health for all remains an important component of SDG targets and requires reducing national public health burden of infectious diseases of poverty. Addressing knowledge gaps between the developing and developed countries require innovative international and multilateral cooperation with priorities on significant infectious diseases, emerging epidemics, the rise of obesity related cardiometabolic and other www.mchandaids.org | \u00a9 2016 Global Health and Education Projects, Inc. chronic diseases. The MDGs, adopted and supported after the Millennium Summit of the United Nations in September 2000, provided a substantial progress in the reduction of poverty and marked improvements in infectious diseases and some neglected tropical diseases in most endemic countries through the Global Funds. It also offered other bilateral aid to the poorest and vulnerable populations worldwide by improving maternal health, reducing child mortality, while combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases. [5, 8, 12, [21] [22] [23] Attaining the SDGs and health for all by 2050 depends primarily on national efforts supported by domestic and regional public-private partnerships and global strategy of increasing access of the world's poor to essential health services. It also depends on support from international multilateral cooperation and collaboration within countries. [15, 17, 20] Further efforts should be devoted at reducing inequality and poverty in health aimed at accelerating progress towards the SDGs and should be a pubic priority. It is worth mentioning that there is still disproportionate health disparity between developing and developed countries. [19, 21] For example children life expectancy chances are dramatically different depending on where they are born. In China life expectancy is longer than in African countries due to premature mortality ratio associated with malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS as well as chronic infections, mainly maternal-child and elderly healthcare delivery. [13, 23, 27, 28] China's global solidarity and partnership support from national income and resources could be a role model on how to assist and work a win-win bilateral collaborative network, technical assistance during threats and epidemics disaster crisis for the safe of humanity, environment and ecosystem. China health expenditure increased more than 30fold and accounted for 5.1% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2011. [17, 20, 22] WHO supported by other governments continues to provide necessary technical and financial support to China through renewed strategic cooperation agenda on transfer of know-how and skills to Africa in tackling infectious diseases control towards elimination. [1, 9, 20, 29] Chinese cooperation is aimed at achieving global health responsibility, which entails strengthening health systems, improving universal health coverage and reducing morbidity and mortality from major infectious diseases of poverty. Such recent efforts in the field of public health include multiple partnerships between the National Institute for Parasitic Diseases (NIPD), Shanghai with several African institutions and universities in the areas of capacity development and training, technology transfer and exchanges coordination and leadership. [19, 23, 30] Most importantly, is the implementation of malaria and schistosomiasis elimination networks across Africa (e.g., Tanzania, Zanzibar, Sudan). [17, 33] Lessons learned and technical assistance from Chinese researchers, ongoing consultation on strategic partnership could be very important in strengthening joint malaria and schistosomiasis projects network with Sudan, Cameroon, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Mali are substantial opportunities.",

For example, China provides funding and technology, while WHO guides technical support and coordination. [18, 19, 31] Furthermore, in 2013, The Chinese government assisted in 2013, to develop and implement strategic plans on snail control and elimination of schistosomiasis. It should be recalled that Chinese experts have provide technical assistance to Pakistan, Nepal, Lao, Myanmar, Vietnam, Nigeria, Tanzania, Angola and Namibia to assist in global polio eradication and Global Fund for malaria and HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis (GFMAT) efforts. [14, 18, 19] China is also reducing inequalities in health and contributing to strengthening global health through supporting collaboration in the global health arena. China is strengthening national and regional priorities in line with International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005), strengthening the Asia Pacific Strategy for Emerging Diseases (APSED) network, Global Schistosomiasis Alliance (GSA) to ArboviralNet. [2, [29] [30] [31] [32] This will enhance capacity in health security and diplomatic power to create maneuver space for international multi-polar geopolitics and financial systems. China has become a giant economic power and vital component of the international commodity chain, allowing for more effective broad-based consultation and participation on global health issues and international finance via different channels by active support of multilateral diplomacy and politics. [23, 25, 30, 31] The first World Bank Trust Fund to End Poverty was established in promoting growing China's interest and role in global health development, and China's health reforms leadership in reducing poverty and strengthening both health systems resource and infrastructure investment. [24] This is essential in embracing and upholding performance-based to outcome-based financing in partners countries.",
