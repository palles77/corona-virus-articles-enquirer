The objective of this prospective interventional study was to evaluate the etiology, diagnostic procedures, risk factors and outcome of pulmonary complications in a cohort of hematopoietic SCT recipients followed up for 1 year. For patients suffering from a pulmonary complication, a diagnostic algorithm that included non-invasive and bronchoscopic procedures was performed. We identified 73 pulmonary complications in 169 patients: 50 (68%) were pneumonias; 21 (29%) were non-infectious complications and 2 (3%) were undiagnosed. Viruses (particularly Rhinovirus) and bacteria (particularly P. aeruginosa) (28 and 26%, respectively) were the most common causes of pneumonia. A specific diagnosis was obtained in 83% of the cases. A non-invasive test gave a specific diagnosis in 59% of the episodes. The diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy was 67 and 78% in pulmonary infections. Early bronchoscopy (\u2a7d5 days) had higher diagnostic yield than late bronchoscopy (78 vs 23%; P = 0.02) for pulmonary infections. Overall mortality was 22 and 32% of all fatalities were due to pulmonary complications. Pulmonary complications are common and constitute an independent risk factor for mortality, stressing the importance of an appropriate clinical management.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] The increasing number of indications and the selection of more debilitated patients as potential candidates for HSCT seem to be changing the epidemiology of PC. 5, 6 Studies have shown that in immunocompromised patients an early identification of the etiology of PC improves survival. 7, 8 Fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) has an important role in the diagnosis of PC; 9-12 however, detractors of this technique consider that the information provided may be also obtained by different non-invasive explorations. [13] [14] [15] The majority of the studies evaluating the etiology, diagnosis and prognosis of PC in patients with hematologic diseases are retrospective, 4, 6, 16 and include both non-transplantation and transplantation recipients. 2, 7 We hypothesized that the prospective follow-up of a cohort of HSCT recipients may improve the clinical management of PC. First, the knowledge of the epidemiology of the PC with the different prevalence of infectious and non-infectious etiologies can be accurately determined. Second, predetermined criteria for performing a FOB should clarify the role of this technique by better defining the diagnostic yield, clinical implications and potential complications. Finally, the identification of prognostic factors is much more precise when data are recorded prospectively in a homogeneous group of immunocompromised patients.",

Change in therapy: any addition or deletion to the treatment attributable to positive or negative results from the bronchoscopy. 15 Among patients who presented multiple complications, each episode was recorded and considered independently. Early/late PC was considered when appearing before or after 6 months of transplantation.",

The diagnostic yield of the different endoscopic techniques, and the influence of the results obtained in treatment decisions are shown in Table 4 . The diagnostic yield of FOB for pulmonary infections was significantly higher when performed early (early FOB, 78% vs late FOB, 23%; P = 0.02). No differences between early and late FOB were evidenced as regards changes in empirical treatment (44 vs 38%; P = NS). There were no remarkable side effects after FOB. Figure 2 illustrates the diagnostic yield of non-invasive tests and FOB on pulmonary infections. Abbreviations: ADV = adenovirus; RSV = respiratory syncytial virus. The relationship between type of transplantation and risk of PC was particularly evident when only infectious PC were considered. Thus, pulmonary infections occurred in 27/79 (34%) of allo-HSCT patients and 9/96 (9%) of auto-HSCT recipients (Po 0.001). Duration of neutropenia (16 \u00b1 5 vs 12 \u00b1 4 days; P o 0.001) was also a risk factor associated with pulmonary infections. Table 5 .

            "text": "The present study demonstrates that PCs are common after HSCT, involving almost 30% of the recipients, and are particularly prevalent over the first 6 months after transplantation. These PC are mostly infectious (68%) with an associated mortality of 18% (9/50). The relative frequencies of different PCs vary at different post-transplantation periods. 16, 25 In this sense, a potential strength of the present study is that by following up all the patients included in the cohort for 1 year, an accurate determination of the prevalence of the different PC can be made. Remarkably, viruses were the most common cause of pulmonary infections, representing 47% (19/40) of pneumonias. Of note, 26% of the episodes of viral pneumonia were mixed (both bacteria and viruses) confirming that co-infection is a common occurrence in these patients. 26 The associated mortality of viral pneumonias was 27, 28 However, the important role that viruses have in the genesis of PC reinforces the importance of prevention strategies. 29 As in other prospective studies, bacteria were involved in 45% of the identified pulmonary infections in our cohort. 19 Remarkably, P. aeruginosa infections represented 61% of total bacterial infections. This finding confirms the current predominance of Gram-negative rods over Gram-positive cocci observed by other authors. 30 Interestingly, fluoroquinolone resistance was frequent (36% of P. aeruginosa isolates) probably owing to the widespread use of fluoroquinolone prophylaxis. This is particularly important as the associated mortality of P. aeruginosa in our series was 45%. Therefore the implementation of prophylactic protocols should be periodically re-evaluated in HSCT recipients depending on the different resistance patterns of each institution. 2, 30 Probable aspergillosis was diagnosed in only four patients, accounting for 10% of the diagnosed pulmonary infections. The low incidence of aspergillosis is most likely the result of the intense surveillance and prophylactic programs designed to avoid these infections. 31 Diagnostic evaluation of PC The present study confirms that the majority of the PC can be etiologically identified (83%). 2 A significant proportion of these episodes (59%) were diagnosed with the implementation of different non-invasive tests thus avoiding the requirement of more invasive procedures. Remarkably, nasopharyngeal swab was a very useful diagnostic tool providing the diagnosis of viral pneumonia in 75% of cases, and in all of them the results were confirmed with BAL. 29 Azoulay et al. 17 confirmed the utility of noninvasive tests in critically ill hematology and oncology patients with acute respiratory failure. More controversial is the role of FOB in the management of PC. 9, 15, 32, 33 In our cohort, with pre-established criteria to perform FOB, the overall diagnostic yield was 67% and increased up to 78% in pulmonary infections. Overall, 28% of the episodes of pulmonary infection could only be diagnosed by this technique. In almost half of the cases, the information obtained caused a change in the empiric treatment. Interestingly, in cases with negative non-invasive tests, the diagnostic yield of FOB was 62% ( Figure 2 ) demonstrating its utility in this particular scenario. Even in those patients with positive non-invasive tests, but with an unsolved or unfavorable clinical course, FOB identified unsuspected microorganisms in 24% of the cases (Figure 2) . Early FOB proportioned a significant increase of isolated pathogens compared with late FOB and mortality in the former group was somewhat lower, although the difference was not statistically significant. Our group had already shown that one of the most critical factors influencing the yield of FOB is the time elapsed between the initiation of symptoms and FOB performance. 7, 34 Establishing an early diagnosis leads to changes in empirical treatment and probably, improvement in prognosis. Shannon et al. 33 highlighted the importance of early diagnosis demonstrating that the diagnostic yield of FOB wanes with the elapsed time following clinical presentation. As in other series, we did not observe remarkable side effects after FOB. 2, 9, 33 In this sense, the conclusive demonstration by Azoulay et al., 17 in a prospective randomized study showing that FOB does not increase the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, reinforce the safety of this procedure and should help reluctant physicians caring for these patients to implement this procedure in early stages.",
