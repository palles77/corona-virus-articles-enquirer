Given the recent emergence of novel infectious agents (eg, H7N9 influenza, Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, or MERS-CoV), there is a renewed focus on pandemic planning. The overarching goal of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is to ''Prevent Avoidable Epidemics: including naturally occurring outbreaks and intentional or accidental releases,'' with a specific objective of ''Reducing the number and magnitude of infectious disease outbreaks.'' 3 Another goal, ''Respond rapidly and effectively to biological threats of international concern,'' has as an objective: ''Improving global access to medical and nonmedical countermeasures during health emergencies.'' 3 To meet these goals, it is essential to focus on existing health inequalities and the social determinants that drive them.",

Furthermore, many of the issues relevant to influenza preparedness planning, like planning for other potential infectious respiratory diseases, are indeed relevant to all nations across the income spectrum.",

            "text": "Since Farmer 7 explored how the very frameworks used to describe infectious diseases obscured their origins in poverty and social inequalities, the literature has continued to grow, linking social determinants of health including poverty, race, ethnicity, social marginalization, physical environment, and other factors to infectious diseases, including influenza, malaria, tuberculosis, Ebola, and other diseases. [7] [8] [9] [10] Although the WHO's Commission on the Social Determinants of Health did not focus substantially on infectious diseases in their report, Closing the Gap, they articulated an expansive plan to address the complex web of determinants that contribute to health inequalities that can further fuel many infectious diseases. 11 The report of the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases describes the relationship between infectious diseases and poverty, arguing that poverty contributes to conditions that cause infectious diseases and subsequently also prevent access to health care. 10 They describe infectious diseases as ''a proxy for poverty and disadvantage'' with subsequent increased risk factors ''affecting populations with low visibility and little political voice,'' ''imposing a heavy health and economic burden,'' and ''having a greater impact where health systems are weak.'' 10(p14) One of the few specific references to infectious respiratory diseases in the Closing the Gap report ties poverty to lower access to treatment for acute respiratory infections in sub-Saharan Africa. 11 These reports and studies reinforce the general understanding that malaria, diarrhea, and tuberculosis are largely correlated with poverty. 7, 10 The link between acute respiratory tract infection (which is the most relevant in pandemic preparedness planning), including influenza, and poverty has not been systematically reviewed and represents a gap in knowledge synthesis from published literature. Our purpose here is to draw attention to the often-unacknowledged link between acute respiratory infection and poverty by summarizing a few salient studies that suggest that poverty is as relevant in the context of acute respiratory tract infection, and specifically influenza, as it is in the context of diarrheal, malarial, or tubercular disease.",

            "text": "Even before the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, Blumenshine et al 12 drew on a social and health disparities model 13 to articulate the potential causes of disparities in the US during an influenza pandemic. They conceptualized that differential exposure to influenza virus, differential susceptibility to disease, and differential access to health care once disease has developed may explain respiratory infection disparities. Although they focused on domestic concerns, the authors state that ''the need for systematic and concrete planning to minimize the social disparities that can be expected to occur in the face of natural disasters such as an influenza pandemic apply worldwide,'' 12(p714) and they explicitly call for action from countries with large subgroups who live in poverty in a weak public infrastructure challenged to meet their needs under normal circumstances. 12 In 2009, Quinn et al 14 operationalized the Blumenshine model, creating empirical measures for exposure, susceptibility, and access, and then used these measures in 2 waves of data collection in the US during the H1N1 pandemic (see Table 1 ). During the second wave of data collection in January 2010, they found that, indeed, the groups that were likely to have higher levels of exposure due to lack of access to resources that would enable social distancing did report having had influenzalike illness (ILI) and were also likely to have less access to care once disease developed (see Table  2 ). 14, 15 In this research focused on the US, absence of workplace policies (paid sick days) contributed to a population attributable risk of 5 million additional ILI cases in the general population and 1.2 million additional cases among Latinos. 15 These results demonstrate that there is significant potential for existing social disadvantage to THE INEQUALITIES AND HEALTH SECURITY contribute to a greater burden of morbidity and mortality from influenza, thereby exacerbating disparities.",

            "text": "Although these studies were conducted in the US, we offer these measures (Table 1 ) and the results ( Table 2 ) with 2 goals in mind. First, researchers and epidemiologists could use these measures as points of departure for developing appropriate measures for the specific national context in which they work. Second, these data indicate that even in high-income countries such as the US, racial and ethnic minorities are at greater risk in a pandemic because of social factors. Multiple epidemiologic studies and reviews have reported higher rates of hospitalization due to 2009 H1N1 pandemic among the poor, those living in poorer neighborhoods, and minorities in the US. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] In addition, studies in other high-income nations uncovered ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in hospitalization rates due to pandemic influenza, and our aim is to stimulate research to uncover the causal mechanisms-which may include up-stream factors in addition to inequitable access to health care-behind these inequalities. In the UK, the mostdeprived quintile had a mortality rate due to 2009 H1N1 influenza 3 times higher than the least-deprived quintile, 21 and South Asian ethnic groups and those living in socioeconomically deprived areas had disproportionately higher rates of laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza. 22 In Canada, a lower education, aboriginal ethnicity, and living in a highly deprived neighborhood were all associated with higher hospitalization rates due to 2009 H1N1. 23 The causal mechanisms leading to these disparities may differ by location, but our previous studies suggest a framework for designing research to uncover these mechanisms. For example, underlying conditions did not fully explain observed inequalities in hospitalization rates in Canada; 23 similarly, underlying chronic conditions and access to health care did not fully explain inequalities in New York City, 19 suggesting that factors further upstream, including differential rates of exposure to virus because of differences in social mixing or differential susceptibility to disease because of differences in vaccination behavior, may need to be examined.",

These changes reflect evolution in our own understanding of the mechanistic basis for inequalities since the original publication. 24 We have realized that collecting data on behavioral and biological factors is key to our ability to test competing proposed hypotheses for the generation of inequalities in respiratory infection. Our model outlines potential causes of disease inequalities within countries and highlights the proximal (ie, downstream, mechanistic) behavioral and biological causes as well as their links to the distal (ie, upstream, social and policy) causes. Our aim is to provide a framework that countries can use to test the mechanisms that may lead to unequal levels of disease and death. It is only once these mechanisms and their relative impacts on disease inequalities are examined that we can test the impact of counterfactual policies to reduce inequalities in disease burden. For example, there may be multiple causes of the observed unequal levels of disease in a given location, including, say, differential vaccine uptake and differential hand-washing behavior. Alternative interventions may be devised to target these causes, and assessing the impact of these alternative policies/interventionspossibly in a simulation environment or with multiple arms in a randomized controlled trial-would allow evidence-based decision making at the country level.",

There was no focus on disadvantaged populations in the guidance on assessment activities. In the document, the terms vulnerable and high risk were used but not defined. There was a call to seek feedback on attitudes and barriers that could affect compliance with directives during a pandemic and brief mention of the need for health communication and health education with vulnerable and high-risk populations. Although Annex 3 of the guidance considers ethical issues in pandemic planning, there is only brief mention of the need to consider equity in access to antivirals by vulnerable and disabled populations. 42 In the PIP Framework Partnership Contribution Implementation Plan, there is 1 mention of inequalities, with this statement: ''A clearer picture of the health burden that influenza imposes on different populations should be established.'' 43(p5) ",

This early attention to sociodemographic information, coupled potentially with GIS capacity, could facilitate attention to the larger social, economic, and physical environment in which those cases occur. An interdisciplinary team, including anthropologists, demographers, sociologists, and others, could design the appropriate intersecting surveillance system that could yield a more complete understanding of the outbreak. Moreover, the ability to detect influenza and other respiratory disease outbreaks and understand the impact on populations already affected by inequities would be addressed by the broader WHO effort to foster national health equity surveillance systems that collect routine data on differential morbidity, mortality, healthcare access, physical environment, relative inequality, social inequities, and sociopolitical context, among other relevant measures. 11 However, we acknowledge that the capacity for surveillance is limited in many countries and that improvements via training, technology, and collaborations are, in fact, a strategy in the GHSA.

While conceivably this could facilitate a broader perspective on inequalities and social determinants as factors in disease outbreaks, attention to inequalities is not identified specifically with any activities or as a role for any partner from community, health system, government, or nongovernment organizations. However promising this framework appears, Kasolo et al's 45 assessment of its implementation found that the community component has been operationalized in only a very limited fashion and that socioeconomic, behavioral, geographic, and logistical challenges remain barriers to timely and effective responses in many countries.",

Models have been used to test intervention effectiveness during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and a potential H5N1 pandemic. [46] [47] [48] Models that showed that preventing air travel and closing schools would have minimal impact on the size of the epidemic informed policy in the US and other countries. Individual-based models can be used to examine the impact of interventions on inequalities. Outputs can be measured by geographic area or wealth quintile, thus quantifying policy impact on not only reducing disease burden overall, but also on reducing inequalities in disease burden. 49, 50 Funding agencies should invest in computational modeling education programs in low-and lower-middle-income countries, similar to investments that the NIH has made in the US. 51 The last point becomes especially salient when decisions need to be made quickly by policymakers in a country. Policymakers are more likely to work with and trust researchers from their own country. Investing in social, epidemiologic, and computational public health research capabilities in low-and lower-middle-income countries will enhance understanding of social inequalities in disease burden and enable policies that reduce these inequalities, as well as disease overall, ultimately enhancing global health security. Although its outcome is not yet known, one example of this is the partnership among the CDC, China CDC, Suzhou CDC, Suzhou Children's Hospital, and Fudan University to examine the economic burden of seasonal influenza among children in China as part of an effort to address vaccine policy in that country. 52 Meeting the goal of ''responding rapidly and effectively to biological threats by improving global access to medical and non-medical countermeasures'' 3 demands that we address the major challenge of fair access to antivirals and vaccines. Farmer et al 53 discuss key steps to expanding access to cancer treatment in poor countries with a 2-pronged strategy: global pricing and procurement strategies in which multiple countries negotiate together for reduced prices, and careful planning so that treatment reaches resourcepoor regions within these countries. A similar mindset is required in pandemic planning. Vaccine donation and distribution systems coordinated by WHO during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic were designed to ensure access to vaccines at a basic level in low-income countries. However, in the WHO's evaluation of their H1N1 vaccine deployment efforts, they identified multiple challenges. 54 Although 122.5 million doses were pledged for donation, in fact those dosages would have covered only 10% of the populations of those countries eligible for donation. Given that eligible countries are low-and lower-middle-income countries, the likelihood of inadequate vaccine for populations already experiencing health inequalities is high. In the review of other criteria for distribution, there is no explicit recognition of inequalities that could contribute to greater disease burden among socially disadvantaged populations.",

Both Inglesby and Fischer 4 and Bernard 2 echo the call for multisectoral efforts and yet recognize the organizational, political, and other obstacles that make these difficult to mount. Such planning for an influenza or other pandemic requires social interventions, policy initiatives, and enhancing access to care prior to the time of a pandemic. Yet, if undertaken, these efforts will yield health and societal benefits beyond the impact on infectious diseases. Some may argue that the GHSA is knowingly blind to the issue of inequalities within or between countries and has as its motive the protection of higher-income nations. However, the PIP Framework explicitly addresses the inequalities between nations. We believe that neither the GHSA nor the PIP Framework gives true attention to inequalities within nations (which exist independent of national GDP) and their potential impact on disease transmission and resulting illness and death from influenza or other respiratory diseases with pandemic potential such as SARS or MERS-CoV. Therefore, it is our role as public health and healthcare professionals to work within our organizations, with communities, and with policymakers to decrease unnecessary exposure, minimize susceptibility (eg, by enhancing access to vaccines when available), and assure care after disease has developed. To do so will reduce the unequal burden of morbidity and mortality. Our ability to accomplish that goal requires seeing pandemics for what they are: infectious diseases embedded in a social and political context-contexts defined by social determinants of health and unequal access to resources often resulting in behavioral and/or biological disparities between population subgroups. Policymakers and THE INEQUALITIES AND HEALTH SECURITY public health leaders must take these existing inequalities into account when planning for pandemics in order to prevent unnecessary suffering and the perpetuation of health and broader social inequities.",
