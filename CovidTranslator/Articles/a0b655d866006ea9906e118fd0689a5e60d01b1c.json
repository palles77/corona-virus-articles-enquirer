In this paper, we describe the validation of the VereFlu TM Lab-on-Chip Influenza Assay, which is based on the integration of two technologies: multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR followed by microarray amplicon detection. This assay simultaneously detects five influenza virus subtypes, including the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1), seasonal H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and influenza B virus. The VereFlu TM assay was clinically validated in Singapore and compared against reference methods of real-time PCR, virus detection by immunofluorescence of cell cultures and sequencing. A sensitivity and specificity of 96.8% and 92.8%, respectively, was demonstrated for pandemic H1N1; 95.7% and 100%, respectively, for seasonal H1N1; 91.2% and 97.6%, respectively, for seasonal H3N2; 95.2% and 100%, respectively, for influenza B. Additional evaluations carried out at the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre, Melbourne, Australia, confirmed that the test was able to reliably detect H5N1. This portable, fast timeto-answer (3 hours) device is particularly suited for diagnostic applications of detection, differentiation and identification of human influenza virus subtypes.",

In contrast, all virus subtypes and combinatorial possibilities of HA and NA have been detected in wild birds and poultry [3] . Since 1997, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses, in particular the H5N1 subtype, have jumped the species barrier and caused ongoing sporadic fatal outbreaks in humans [4] . Therefore, the looming threat of pandemics from influenza viruses cannot be overlooked, and assays that enable rapid, accurate identification and subtyping of influenza viruses is pertinent for surveillance and outbreak management.",

Additional primers and probes were designed against the NA segments of pandemic H1N1 and H5N1 to facilitate subtyping. Reverse primers were synthesized with the addition of a 5 0 -terminal Cy5 label (Sigma Proligo, Singapore). The capture probes were designed using the variable regions of the genes ( Table 1 ). The assay comprised 14 influenza-virus-specific PCR primers and a set of forward and reverse PSII primers for the amplification of a PCR-positive control of plant origin (Table 1) . Together, these primers constituted the VereFlu TM primer mix A. There were 23 influenza targeted capture probes, 2 RT-PCR control probes, and positive and negative hybridization control probes (Table 1) .",

All specimens were subjected to influenza virus detection by real-time RT-PCR and shellvial culture followed by immunofluorescence (IF) assay. Swabs taken from patients using flocked swabs (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA) were transported in 3 ml of Copan Universal Transport Medium (UTM). UTM specimens were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used for viral culture using standard shell vial technique and the other was subject to nucleic acid extraction using an EZ1 BioRobot (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).

The test is based on an on-chip multiplex RT-PCR amplification followed by detection using a microarray, and it can be performed fairly rapidly, taking about 3 h to complete. Each TCS or thermal reactor accommodates a maximum of five chips, which can be run either simultaneously or independently using different protocols. The modular nature of the system allows the linkup of more than one TCS unit to the computer, hence enabling the system to be adapted to the throughput needs of either large-or small-scale diagnostic settings. Laboratory reproducibility data from our study suggest that the assay is easy to handle, which is an important consideration during outbreak situations. The overall clinical sensitivity for all influenza A viruses tested was 94.3%, and the specificity was 96.8%. These values were comparable to those obtained in similar microarray based influenza virus typing assays [18, 19] . It is known that microarray-based detection and typing of influenza viruses is generally less sensitive than performing a real-time PCR [9, 19] . Our analytical sensitivity was determined to be 10 2 copies/reaction for each influenza type. These figures are similar to those reported by Huang et al. [9] , at 10 2 RNA copies/reaction for seasonal H3N2, H1N1, H5N1 and influenza B virus. The detection limit for a multiplex PCR assay has been reported to be 50 copies for influenza A and influenza B viruses [20] , which explains why some of the samples that were typed and confirmed by the reference methods of cell culture and real-time RT PCR were missed by the VereFlu TM assay.",

Multiplexing capabilities of real-time PCR reactions are typically limited to a fourplex as restricted by the number of fluorescence acquisition channels present in the PCR instrument. In contrast, the detection format in the VereFlu TM assay is low-density-array-based, allowing tens to hundreds of capture probes to be spotted and correspondingly allowing a similar number of amplicons to be detected. Hence, the arrays have a much greater detection capability for robust parallel testing than real-time PCR.",

In our assay, capture probe cross-reactions were observed for the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) probe with human coronavirus OC43 and the influenza B capture probe with human adenovirus type 7. During the testing of clinical samples, false positives of this nature will be unlikely, as hybridization to only one capture probe (instead of both probes for influenza B virus or all three probes for 2009 pandemic H1N1) is insufficient to permit the VereFlu TM software to call a positive result. Instead, the operator will be alerted that the particular influenza gene segment has been detected, and a re-test will be advised.
