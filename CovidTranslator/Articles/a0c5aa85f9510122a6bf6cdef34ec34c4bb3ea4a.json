Unlike in viral hepatitis, 11 histological outcomes are not known to be valid surrogate outcomes in the assessment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. After all, the ultimate aim is not to change histology but to prevent the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In this respect, results of recent longitudinal studies 12, 13 showed that fi brosis, but not other histological features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, correlated with overall and disease-specifi c mortality. Fibrosis progression can also occur in patients with NAFLD who do not have steatohepatitis, albeit at a slower rate. 14, 15 These outcomes highlight the urgent need to defi ne reliable surrogate outcomes for the disorder. Until the time comes when there are robust surrogate outcomes for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, the follow-up of treated patients for long-term clinical outcomes will be very important.",

            "text": "Since the Rio Carnival participants are largely domestic, and the spread of Zika virus is already extensive, it will be challenging to assess if there was excess transmission related to the Carnival. Although winter temperatures mean that mosquito density is expected to be low in Brazil at the time of the Olympics, given the summer time mosquito density in the northern hemisphere, including in Saudi Arabia, the introduction of a few infections to the mosquito population might be suffi cient to cause outbreaks of Zika virus in other countries. 6, 7 In Brazil, cases of dengue are more frequent from February to May. 8 In the regions of Saudi Arabia frequented by pilgrims (Jeddah, Mecca, Medina), Aedes aegypti larvae are present throughout the year, nearly two thirds in indoor habitats. Larvae density is, however, variable and decreases in the months before October. In these regions, where rainfall is rare and unpredictable, reports have suggested all year risk for dengue fever, with dengue seroprevalence ranging from 32% to 57% among general patients seeking medical consultations. 7, 9 Although the Olympics and the Hajj are very diff erent events, each of them might favour transmission of Zika virus. The Olympics attracts mostly young healthy adults from middle and upper-middle income groups who live in developed countries. Such visitors are less likely to have been exposed to arbovirus infections and less familiar with mosquito bite prevention than Hajj pilgrims. Sexual transmission of Zika virus from commercial sex workers with asymptomatic infection might also be a possibility for those who attend the Olympics. 10 By contrast, the Hajj and Umrah participants are more likely to be older adults, many of whom have pre-existing health problems, and about two thirds of them originate from low-income countries and the tropics where personal habits of mosquito bite prevention can be suboptimum. 4 Also, Umrah and Hajj pilgrims' immersion in religious rituals could reduce personal uptake of mosquito avoidance measures.",

Health-care providers can be encouraged to use travel health visits as an opportunity to emphasise the need for personal protection against mosquito bites and sexual transmission. Health advice for individuals can be provided during predeparture health visits that are usually routine for pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia. Additionally, by training athletic coaches on prevention of Zika virus transmission, their frequent contacts with athletes can be used to remind athletes about the need for compliance with public health advisories. Public health agencies in the home countries of travellers to Brazil and Saudi Arabia can partner with travel agencies and transport services, including airlines, to engage in communication about risks of disease transmission. Advice on personal protection can be reinforced at points of departure and arrival in home and host countries. Increasing the availability and distribution points of methods to prevent mosquito bites is also crucial. Similar approaches were part of prevention eff orts for pandemic infl uenza A H1N1 in 2009 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2013 during the Hajj. 5, 13, 14 Methods for prevention of mosquito bites can be provided to each traveller at the arrival port before immigration control. Given that Brazil is facing a shortage of supply of insect repellents, global eff orts will be needed to procure and distribute them in adequate quantity.",
