In this experiment, the bacterial strain S. epidermidis was injected using a nebulizer into the test chamber, which was similar to a consumer living space (60 m 3 ). The microbial sampling was conducted via the air sampler method, and the reduction in S. epidermidis growth was monitored by performing three consecutive tests. Initially, a blank test was conducted to determine the natural decay rate and calibrate the experimental setup. After injecting the bacterial strain from 1240 to 11180 CFU per unit volume (m 3 ), the natural decay rate showed a maximum deviation of 3.1% with a sampling error of 1.1% p at a confidence level of 95%. In addition, the particle size distribution in the test chamber was found to range from 0.3 to 5.0 \u03bcm, and a subsequent decrease in large-sized particles was observed with the operation of the air purifier, which is the size similar to that of suspended airborne bacteria. This can be used to assess the performance of the air purifier by calibrating the natural reduction value to the reduced operation value. Thus, the single-chamber technique is a promising approach for analyzing the removal efficacy of airborne bacteria from indoor air.",

            "text": "Recently, the infectious diseases caused by airborne bacteria and viruses are of primary global concern for both social and economic reasons. For example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused the deaths of nearly 700 people and affected almost 8000 during the first outbreak in [2002] [2003] ; it eventually spread around 37 countries, causing a cost of $18 billion, primarily in Asia (S\u00f8rensen et al. 2006) . Moreover, between 2009 and 2010, nearly 17,000 healthy adults died globally from influenza A (H1N1), and the seasonal influenza continues to kill many people annually (Tellier 2009; Chiu et al. 2017) . Bioaerosols are airborne microorganisms that are either infectious or noninfectious in nature and that can easily spread to the environment via air in a short span of time (Ki Youn et al. 2010) . With air as the transportation media, pathogenic bacteria, viruses, fungi, and biological fragments can instantly affect human health (Lee et al. 2008) . Generally, these pathogenic bioaerosols enter and exit the respiratory system through breathing, coughing, laughing, sneezing, and personal contact (Shrivastava et al. 2013) . Tuberculosis, whooping cough, meningitis, anthrax, and pneumonia are some of the most common examples of airborne bacterial diseases (Eickhoff 1996) .",

In the removal method, an air purifier with filters (high-efficiency particulate air filter) is used to trap and eliminate infectious bioaerosols. In the disinfection method, disinfectants such as a light catalyzer, UV lamp, and chlorine are used to kill the airborne microorganisms (Pham and Lee 2015; Zacar\u00edas et al. 2012; Berry et al. 2007 ). The high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration technique is effectively used to reduce bioaerosols in laboratories and hospitals (Herrera-Cant\u00fa et al. 2017) . The major mechanism of the high-efficiency air filter involves removing airborne microparticles from the indoor environment (Mittal et al. 2011 ). In addition, the indoor installation of an air purifier can significantly reduce airborne bacteria, molds, and mycobacteria. Wen et al. (2014) evaluated the filtration efficiency of a HEPA filter in a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratory using the aerosolized bacteria, Serratia marcescens, and reported the effective performance of the HEPA filter against these aerosolized bacteria. Moreover, Foarde (2010) used the single-pass method in a chamber filter to evaluate the collection efficiency of filters and the removal of non-biological particles.",

The filter test and removal of particles range from 0.3 to 10.0 \u03bcm, and the higher-grade numbers show better performance in particle removal.

The peculiarity of this study is that it has a built-in HEPA filter installed in a single chamber to evaluate an air cleaner and it prevents contaminations from anything other than the airborne bacteria we use in our experiments. So, we evaluated the efficiency of an air purifier on the removal of the injected bacterial strain, S. epidermidis, in a single-test chamber. In this method, the air purifier was installed and tested in a manner similar to a customer's usage conditions. The microbial samples were collected from the chamber directly to the agar culture medium using the impaction sampling technique, and then the range of colony formation was analyzed. The natural decay rate, operational decay test, and particle distribution rate were analyzed, and the results were discussed in detail. Through these studies, the bacteria removal performance of the air cleaner was evaluated and it helps the consumers to check the performance in advance.",

            "text": "Generally, the filters in an air purifier can trap airborne particles by means of size exclusion, in which the air is forced through the filter and the particles are physically captured. In this present investigation, the size distribution of the particles inside the airtight chamber (analyzed using a particle counter) was found to be in the range of 0.3 to 5.0 \u03bcm (Fig. 3) . The results indicated that the distribution of larger-sized particles decreased over time, due to the performance of the air purifier (Table 1) . Here, particles near the size of a microbe (1 \u03bcm) were also observed to decrease by~10% after 1 h of the experiment. Moreover, the particle size distribution of the bacterial strain also showed a similar decreasing pattern. However, the rates of decrease were higher for the test bacteria than for airborne particles; this may be attributed to the adhesion of microbes with liquid droplets. Therefore, the reduction rate is larger than that of the normal particles, even when the size of the microbes equals 1 \u03bcm. This is because the weights of the microbes increase when combined with liquid droplets, and the particle size has been estimated to be \u2264 5 \u03bcm. Consistent with our data, the microbial size has been shown to range between 1 and \u2264 7.5 \u03bcm and increase with increasing temperature (Tham and Zuraimi 2005) . By contrast, a previous investigation on the size distribution of airborne heterotrophic bacteria has revealed aerodynamic diameters between 1.1 and 2.1 \u03bcm in one fraction respirable particulate matter and another at the coarse fraction with a diameter above 7 \u03bcm (Raisi et al. 2012 ). In addition, the distribution of bacteria has been controlled and influenced by the nebulizer used for the generation of bioaerosols. According to Kujundzic et al. (2006) , the aerodynamic size distribution of bacteria generated with the nebulizer can vary due to the generation of particles with both larger and smaller aerodynamic diameters (0.3-0.6 \u03bcm). But, due to various complexities like coalescence in determining aerosol particle lifetime in the atmosphere, there are very few experimental studies that have been performed to research interparticle interactions (Bzdek and Reid 2017) . Moreover, the behavior of the particles mainly depends upon the physicochemical properties like agglomeration state, shape, crystal structure, chemical composition, surface area, surface chemistry, surface charge, and porosity (Oberd\u00f6rster et al. 2005) . The natural decay test was conducted seven times with bacterial concentrations varying from 1240 to 11,180 CFU/m 3 ( Table 2 ). The results indicated that the maximum deviation was 3.1% with the allowed sample error of \u00b1 1.1% p at a 95% confidence level. It was observed that the bacteria decrease at a constant rate at constant intervals upon the injection of bacterial strain into the airtight chamber of constant space (Fig. 4a, b) . Based on these observations, the results of the operational decay test showed the performance of the air purifier itself by correcting the natural decay rate. The efficiency of the air purifier on the removal of S. epidermidis was found to be similar to that reported by Wen et al. (2014) , where S. marcescens was effectively filtered by a HEPA filter under the laboratory test unit. Before injecting the microbial samples into the chamber, the internal air in the chamber was cleaned and sterilized. The proliferation of bioaerosols was Fig. 5 Colony of S. epidermidis after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. a Before operation (t = 60 min). b After operation (t = 120 min). c Negative control. d Positive control controlled when the air purifier (HEPA filter) device and UV filter were switched on before the natural decay test. The natural decay rate was observed to be in the range from 78.78 to 81.85% for 60 min. Here, UV is used to sterilize the air, and the particle flow through the HEPA filter comes into contact with the surfaces of the fibers by means of van der Waals forces and removed from the air stream (Taylor et al. 2016 ). In addition, the test unit (air purifier) was fixed in three different setups, specifically in stand, ceiling, and wall mount types, and they all showed similar removal efficiencies, which would help the product accommodate the lifestyle of the consumer.",

The raised and cohesive colonies were approximately 1 to 2 mm in size after incubation at 37\u00b0C for 24 h (Fig. 5a, b) , and Fig. 5c and d show the negative and positive controls, respectively. Prior to the air purifier operation, the nebulized bacteria were found to be high and similar to the positive control. Once the airborne microbes were captured by the filter, the rate of suspended bacteria becomes very low or even zero. Thus, the HEPA filters built into air purifiers are made of intertwined fibers, where the smallest particles or microbes become trapped in three ways: interception, impaction, or diffusion. The smallest airborne microbes were most likely trapped in the fibers by means of diffusion. Once the microbes enter into the filter, they will colloid with the gas molecules and embed into the fibers of the filter (Herrera-Cant\u00fa et al. 2017) . Here, the microbes suffer from lack of nutrients, and the high humidity in this environment leads to low proliferation. In addition, while selecting the test organism, the few criteria were observed, because the test device was a household air purifier; the most important challenge was that the organisms needed to be representative of the bacteria typically found in human dwelling spaces.",

Programmed and periodic cleaning and sterilization activities of the chamber were performed as a pre-measure for the contaminations. The result suggests that the rate of decrease in microbes in a chamber with injected microbes after some fixed time was constant. The natural decrease rate had a correlation within the range of 1240-11,180 CFU of microbe density per 1 m 3 . By calibrating the operation value to the natural decay rate, the bacterial removal capability of the air purifier can be verified and the error of the resulting value can be minimized. Thus, this evaluation method for the air purifier device performance is considered to be promising for improving air filtration technology.",
