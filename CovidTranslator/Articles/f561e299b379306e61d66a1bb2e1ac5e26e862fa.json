Structure-activity data generated from both syn-and anti-aldol precursors provides significant insights into the requirements for enhanced potency, validating the ketone-to-aryl halide bioisostere hypothesis.",

Although all compounds were significantly less active against HL-60 than the parent molecules, surprisingly, compounds 3a, 4c-4e, 5e, and 8d exhibited high potency against doxorubicin-resistant cell line HL-60/A (IC 50 = 6.2-19 lM), and their activities against HL-60/A were comparable to that of their parent molecules. In view of their novel activities against HL-60/A, compound 5e with inhibitory activity against HL-60/A (IC 50 = 6.2 \u00b1 0.5 lM) was selected for study its preliminary mechanism. The result reveals that compound 5e can obviously induce apoptosis. ",
