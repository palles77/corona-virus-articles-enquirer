Since CPV infection is primarily a disease of younger animals it is especially important that all puppies be properly vaccinated. The presence of neutralizing antibodies (SN) to CPV in the serum is a useful measure of the susceptibility of a dog to infection (Pollock and Carmichael, 1982) .

However, HI and SN results are subject to interassay procedural variations and require several days to perform (Wallace et al., 1983) .",

To develop a FIPV-antibody based ELISA the strategy outlined for CPV ( Figure   1 ) was followed. Unfortunately, the results were highly irreproducible and a poor correlation with either clinical signs or IFA results was obtained. The direct antigen assay approach was abandoned and an attempt was made to utilize a series of coronavirus-specific monoclonal antibodies in a competitive ELISA format (Fiscus et al., 1985) represented schematically in Figure 2 .",

One of the more important elements of pathogenesis is the development of immune-complexes containing FIPV-specific antibodies. Because of this the most commonly used assay for FIPV infection is an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using FIPV or TGEV-infected cells as substrate.

It has proven extremely useful in controlling the spread of disease as no vaccine or therapy exists.
