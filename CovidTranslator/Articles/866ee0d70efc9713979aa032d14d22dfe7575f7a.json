Recent data indicate that the HIV-1 quasispecies that arise following a mucosal infection are usually derived from a single transmitted virus. Moreover, the finding that the first effective immune responses drive the selection of virus escape mutations provides insight into the earliest immune responses against the transmitted virus and their contributions to the control of acute viraemia. Strong innate and adaptive immune responses occur subsequently but they are too late to eliminate the infection. In this Review, we discuss recent studies on the kinetics and quality of early immune responses to HIV-1 and their implications for developing a successful preventive HIV-1 vaccine.",

Although it is not possible to study the very first events following HIV-1 transmission in humans in vivo, we have gained some understanding from studies in which mucosal tissue explants were infected in vitro [3] [4] [5] . Further understanding of the first stages of infection in vivo has been obtained from studies in which macaques were inoculated intrarectally or intravaginally with SIV 6, 7 . It is still uncertain whether HIV-1 is transmitted as a free or a cell-bound virus, but SIV can be transmitted in either form 8 . In addition, the mechanism by which HIV-1 crosses the genital mucosal epithelium is unclear. Diffusion of HIV-1 across the vaginal mucosa is slowed by cervicovaginal mucus 9 . It is possible that virus that reaches the mucosal epithelium crosses this barrier by transcytosis or by making direct contact with dendrites of intraepithelial dendritic cells (DCs). Preliminary unpublished findings suggest that virions may also move through intercellular spaces in the epithelium to make initial cell contact with underlying mucosal Langerhans cells and CD4 + T cells (T. Hope and S. McCoombe, personal communication). Given that multiple sexual exposures are usually needed for infection to occur, crossing of the epithelial cell barrier by the virus is probably a rare event, although it is more common if the genital mucosa is damaged by physical trauma or co-existing genital infections 10, 11 .",

Single-genome amplification and sequencing of the first detectable virus has shown that ~80% of mucosally transmitted HIV-1 clade B and C infections are initiated by a single virus [12] [13] [14] . Infectious molecular clones derived from these primary founder viruses could infect CD4 + T cells with greater efficiency than they could infect monocytes and macrophages 14 , which differs from the virus quasispecies that arise later in the infection and can infect lymphoid and myeloid cell types with equal efficiency. Studies in rhesus macaques inoculated intra-rectally with a complex SIV quasispecies also showed that productive infection arises from a single infecting virus 15 , which supports the use of SIV infection of rhesus macaques as a model for HIV-1 transmission and vaccine studies. In other studies 7, 16 in which macaques were infected experimentally, the first cells to be infected in the vaginal mucosa were found in foci of resident memory T cells that expressed the virus receptors CD4 and CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), which is consistent with the cell tropism of cloned HIV-1 founder virus 14 .",

This process is augmented by DCs that bind and internalize virus through DC-specific ICAM3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN; also known as CD209) and carry the virus to activated T cells 18 . B cells may also be involved in the early spread of infection by binding the virus through the complement receptor CD21 (also known as CR2) 19 . The virus then replicates rapidly and spreads throughout the body to other lymphoid tissues, particularly gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), where activated CD4 + CCR5 + memory T cells are present in high numbers [20] [21] [22] . Approximately 20% of CD4 + T cells in the GALT are infected in both humans with acute HIV-1 infection and SIV-infected macaques. Up to 60% of uninfected CD4 + T cells at this site become activated and die by apoptosis, resulting in the release of apoptotic microparticles that can suppress immune function 23 . Therefore, 80% of CD4 + T cells in the GALT can be depleted in the first 3 weeks of HIV-1 infection 20, 24, 25 . while HIV-1 is replicating in the GALT and other lymphoid tissues, the plasma viraemia increases exponentially to reach a peak, usually more than a million RNA copies per ml of blood, at 14-21 days after SIV infection in macaques and at 21-28 days after HIV-1 infection in humans (FIG. 1) . CD4 + T cell numbers are low at the time of peak viraemia but later return to near normal levels in the blood but not in the GALT 20, 24, 25 . Although B cells are not depleted during early HIV-1 infection, B cell responses are impaired owing to the destruction of other cell types that are important for the development of germinal centres. Up to 50% of germinal centres in the gut are lost within the first 80 days of infection 26 .",

Similar virus vector-based vaccines have been shown to stimulate simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-specific CD8 + T cell responses in rhesus macaques, and an adenovirus serotype 5 vector expressing Gag protected against challenge with a chimeric SIV-HIV (SHIV89.6p) virus but was not protective against challenge with the more natural SIVmac239 (REF. 156 ).

Therefore, the influence of the host's genetics on the immune response to HIV-1 infection may be more evident. The most dramatic finding in this regard is that homozygosity for a 32 base pair deletion in CCR5, which abrogates its expression, protects almost completely from HIV-1 infection 48 . Furthermore, the HLA alleles HLA-B*5701, HLA-B*5703, HLA-B*5801, HLA-B27 and HLA-B51 are all associated with good control of the virus and a slower progression to AIDS 49 , partly because the epitopes recognized by the T cells in these individuals are focused on conserved regions of the viral Gag protein (see below). A genome-wide association study 50 found a strong protective influence for a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) located 35 kilobases upstream of the HLA-C locus and confirmed the association of HLA-B57 with a low viral set point. This HLA-C-linked SNP may be associated with low-level expression of HLA-C 50 , which might in turn affect T cell or natural killer (NK) cell function during HIV-1 infection. By contrast, some subtypes of HLA-B35 are associated with rapid disease progression, especially if homozygous 51 , although the mechanism is not understood.",

Frequent samples were taken before infection, through peak viraemia and sero-conversion 57, 58 . Samples from different donors were aligned relative to the time that viral RNA was first detectable (100 copies per ml) (T 0 ). The first detectable innate immune response, occurring sometimes just before T 0 , was an increase in the levels of some acute-phase proteins, such as serum amyloid A (H. Kramer and B. Kessler, personal communication). A further wave of acute-phase protein production coincided with a cytokine response (described below) and a rapid increase in plasma viraemia. The production of acute-phase proteins can be triggered by proinflammatory cytokines (such as interleukin-1 (IL-1)) and also by extrinsic factors such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS is detectable in the plasma during chronic infection with HIV-1 or SIV and may be derived from commensal bacteria that translocate from the gut lumen following depletion of HIV-1-infected intestinal CCR5 + T helper 17 cells 21, 22, 59 . Immunostaining of GALT biopsies collected from acutely infected patients showed higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than healthy tissues 60 .",

In vitro, pDCs become activated by the binding of viral envelope proteins to CD4 expressed by the pDCs followed by virion endocytosis and by the triggering of Toll-like receptor 7 by viral RNA 67 . However, HIV-exposed conventional DCs do not become fully activated and show defective IL-12 production 68 , which is consistent with the low levels of IL-12 observed during acute HIV infection 58 . In addition, HIV-exposed pDCs produce IFN\u03b1, which enhances adaptive immune responses.

NK and NKT cells can control HIV replication through cytolysis of virally infected cells and the production of antiviral cytokines and chemokines.

This finding, and the clear role of KIR3D molecules in determining the viral set point 52, 54 , supports the involvement of NK cells in the control of HIV-1. However, the timing of NK cell antiviral effects remains uncertain. NK cells do not contribute to the selection of virus escape mutants before peak viraemia, although it is possible, but not proved, that they account for some of the unexplained mutations that appear together with those that are selected by early T cell responses as viraemia decreases to reach the set point 75 .

Because NK cells share some characteristics with memory cells after their initial activation 76, 77 , it may be possible to prime their antiviral activity through vaccination. However, the activation of innate immunity should be attempted with caution, as innate immune responses can also be harmful. For example, induction of mucosal inflammatory responses by some microbicides has led to increased acquisition of HIV-1 infection (reviewed in REF. 78 ). Furthermore, as discussed earlier, activated DCs can transmit virus to CD4 + T cells produced by pDCs can recruit susceptible CD4 + T cells to the foci of infection 16, 79 . Immune activation induced by innate immune cells and the resulting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines can promote HIV-1 replication. Type I IFNs and TNF also have pro-apoptotic effects and can thereby contribute to a loss of activated DCs and the bystander destruction of CD4 + T cells and B cells. The opposing effects of innate immune activation were highlighted in a study in which IL-15 was administered to treat acute SIV infection in rhesus macaques: NK cell and SIV-specific CD8 + T cell numbers were increased, resulting in fewer SIV-infected cells in lymph nodes, but the activation and proliferation of CD4 + T cells was enhanced and a higher viral load was established 80 . Therefore, vaccine-induced activation of innate immune responses will have to be thoroughly tested in the macaque SIV model and used with caution in humans.",

Rapid selection of mutations occurs at discrete sites in the virus genome as viraemia declines to the viral set point 14, 83 (FIG. 4) . Detailed analysis of four patients during the very early stages of infection 75 indicated that most of the amino acid changes in the virus were selected by CD8 + T cells that recognize epitopes expressed by the founder virus but not by the escape mutant virus. Mutations in the viral envelope protein that were selected by neutralizing antibodies appeared later, at ~12 weeks. A minority of virus escape mutants were not associated with demonstrable T cell responses: a few mutations were probably reversions from the sequence of the transmitted virus that was selected by T cells in the patient's sexual partner; others may have been selected by antibody-dependent cell-mediated virus inhibition or by NK cells. Notably, T cell-and antibody-mediated selection of viral escape mutants rarely involved a single amino acid change in the epitope; most mutants involved multiple changes such that various mutants were 'tested' until the fittest were selected 75 . The first T cell-selected mutations could replace the original sequence of the founder virus within 10 days, and were then followed by sequential selection of escape mutations at different epitopes. This pattern continues throughout the course of HIV infection 75 . Changes in sequence could involve amino acids that are upstream of the T cell epitope and are probably important for antigen processing [84] [85] [86] .",

            "text": "The finding that escape mutants appeared so rapidly raises questions regarding the effectiveness of the early T cell response. A mathematical model has provided some answers 75 . The rapid loss of the founder virus sequence and its replacement by escape mutant viruses implies complete CD8 + T cell-mediated inhibition of virus production by infected cells. From the rate of loss of founder virus sequence, the fraction of cells killed per day was calculated to be 0.15-0.35 for the earliest T cell responses 75 . As a virus-infected cell has a lifespan of 1 day in vivo, this means that 15-35% of infected cells must be killed prematurely by a single T cell response, which must reduce virus production. Therefore, CD8 + T cells curb viraemia in acute HIV-1 infection. However, selection of escape mutants would as the founder virus and if the earliest responses were not immediately succeeded by new T cell responses to new (mutated) epitopes, which in turn may select further escape mutants 75 (FIG. 4) . Ultimately, responding T cells target epitopes that are more highly conserved and in which escape occurs at a cost to the fitness of the virus. Such immunodominant responses to more highly conserved epitopes are more likely to result in a lower level of viraemia at the set point 89 . When a virus that has undergone such escape mutations is transmitted, its set point is also lower in the new host 90 . The level of set point viraemia is therefore influenced by the nature of the transmitted virus and the specificity of early CD8 + T cell responses. Immunodominant T cell responses to the more conserved immunodominant virus epitopes are likely to result in a lower viral set point 89 .",

            "text": "CD8 + T cells are also important for the maintenance of viral set point. There have been many reports of virus escape mutations from around the time the set point is reached 30,32,84,85,91-99 . Using the same mathematical models as described earlier, CD8 + T cells are thought to make only a small contribution (killing 4-6% of virus-infected cells per day) to infected-cell death during chronic infection 100 , the rest being due to virus cytopathicity or infected-cell activation. However, this may be an underestimate of the T cell contribution because of the fitness costs of the escape mutations on the virus, such that mutant viruses grow more slowly than the founder virus. Some of the epitopes that are recognized by the T cells during later stages of infection are so highly conserved that the virus must undergo compensating mutations at other sites for escape to occur 75, 94, 97, 98, 101 , which slows the outgrowth of the mutant viruses. The calculation is further confounded by the difficulty of simultaneous virus escape from more than one T cell response 13, 85, 91 . In contrast to the earliest stages of HIV-1 infection when the range of epitopes recognized by the T cell response is narrow, the later response is broad, often directed against more than 10 epitopes 102 . Responses to conserved epitopes are probably important in the long-term control of viral load, because patients with HLA-B27, HLA-B*5701, HLA-B*5703 or HLA-B*5801 that do well clinically have CD8 + T cells that recognize less-variable regions of the virus, particularly in Gag. The HIV-1 quasispecies in these patients do escape slowly during long-term infection, but each escape mutant incurs a proved fitness cost to the virus 101 . The time it takes for the first T cell responses to become targeted to conserved epitopes might be important in determining long-term control of viral infection 75, 88, 99 . It is not clear what features determine which CD8 + T cell epitopes will become immunodominant; it is clear that HLA type is important, but the precursor frequency of naive T cells that are specific for HIV proteins is also likely to be a factor that is probably influenced both by genetics and a history of previous (cross-reactive) antigen exposure. Vaccines could influence this.",

The first detectable B cell response was found to occur 8 days after T 0 in the form of immune complexes, whereas the first free antibody in the plasma was specific for Env glycoprotein (gp)41 and appeared 13 days after T 0 . By contrast, the appearance of Env gp120-specific antibodies was delayed an additional 14 days, as was the production of other nonneutralizing Env-specific antibodies 57, 118, [121] [122] [123] (FIG. 5; TABLE 1 ). The first HIV-1specific IgA responses in mucosal secretions, which were detected within the first 3 weeks after T 0 , also recognized gp41 during acute HIV infection (N. L. Yates and G.D.T., unpublished observations). A study that applied mathematical modelling to early viral dynamics indicated that the initial gp41-specific IgG and IgM responses did not significantly affect the early dynamics of plasma viral load 57 . These acute gp41-and gp120-specific antibodies did not select escape mutations, indicating that these early arising antibodies are ineffective against HIV-1. Similar analyses of the effect of the initial immune complexes and gp41-specific IgA responses on viral dynamics are needed to understand the interplay between the initial host antibody responses and virus replication. It is not known why the initial antibody response to Env is non-neutralizing; it may relate to the immunodominance of denatured or non-functional Env forms 124, 125 . The first antibodies to induce escape mutants are autologous-virus-neutralizing antibodies that develop ~12 or more weeks after transmission (TABLE 1) . Fc receptor (FcR)-mediated and complement-associated anti-HIV effector functions have also been reported during primary infection [126] [127] [128] ; however, further studies are required to define their role and capacity to select escape mutations.",

These observations indicate that both genetic factors and maturation of the antibody response to HIV-1 are necessary for the generation of this rare, late, broadspecificity, neutralizing antibody response. Affinity maturation through somatic hypermutation may be crucial for the generation of these neutralizing antibodies and may be delayed because of impaired CD4 + T cell help. Because the 2F5, 4E10 and 1b12 monoclonal antibodies have long hydrophobic complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3) sequences and show polyreactivity for autologous molecules, it has been suggested that B cell regulatory mechanisms such as self tolerance may control their production 136 .",

The early perturbations to B cells by the virus similarly indicate the need for a vaccine that either has high levels of durable protective antibody responses or primes in order to induce a rapid secondary response.

After transmission, there is probably only a 5-10 day window during the eclipse phase in which the virus-infected cells could be eradicated, before the virus spreads widely and integrates to generate long-lasting and noneradicable reservoirs of latent virus. True sterilizing immunity can be attained only if the virus is prevented from infecting any host cells. This could be achieved only through broadspecificity neutralizing antibodies that are already present in the plasma and at mucosal sites before virus transmission. In support of this hypothesis, it has been shown that local application, or intravenous injection, of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against SIV in macaques is protective against subsequent challenge with the virus [141] [142] [143] [144] .",

The time between infection and the first detection of viral RNA in the plasma is referred to as the eclipse phase. Plasma virus levels then increase exponentially, peaking at 21-28 days after infection, and this is followed by a slower decrease in plasma viral RNA levels. Patients can be categorized into Fiebig stages I-VI, which are based on a sequential gain in positive HIV-1 clinical diagnostic assays (viral RNA measured by PCR, p24 and p31 viral antigens measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), HIV-1-specific antibody detected by ELISA and HIV-1specific antibodies detected by western blot). Patients progress from acute infection through to the early chronic stage of infection at the end of Fiebig stage V, approximately 100 days following infection, as the plasma viral load begins to plateau. b | Fundamental events in acute HIV-1 infection. Following HIV-1 infection, the virus first replicates locally in the mucosa and is then transported to draining lymph nodes, where further amplification occurs. This initial phase of infection, until systemic viral dissemination begins, constitutes the eclipse phase. The time when virus is first detected in the blood is referred to as T 0 ; after this there is an exponential increase in plasma viraemia to a peak 21-28 days after infection. By this time, significant depletion of mucosal CD4 + T cells has already occurred. Around the time of peak viraemia, patients may become symptomatic and reservoirs of latent virus are established in cells that have a slower rate of decay than CD4 + T cells. The 'window of opportunity' between transmission and peak viraemia, prior to massive CD4 + T cell destruction and the establishment of viral reservoirs, is the narrow but crucial period in which an HIV-1 vaccine must control viral replication, prevent extensive CD4 + T cell depletion and curb generalized immune activation.

An increase in the level of soluble tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; also known as TNFSF10) in the plasma is the first evidence of infection-induced apoptosis and/or immune activation and it occurs before the peak in viraemia. This increase in TRAIL also coincides with the appearance of high levels of interferon-\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1; see FIG. 3 ). Soon thereafter increases in the number of apoptotic microparticles are observed, followed by increased levels of soluble TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2; also known as TNFRSF1B) and soluble FAS ligand. A portion of the microparticles express CC-chemokine receptor 5, suggesting that they originate from cellular targets of HIV-1 infection. The appearance of these soluble components in the plasma early during HIV-1 infection probably represents a pathological rather than a protective cascade of events that is a cause of, or is associated with, virus-induced CD4 + T cell death. b | Electron micrograph of apoptotic microparticles and exosomes in the plasma from a patient with acute HIV-1 infection.

The first systemically detectable immune responses to HIV-1 infection are the increases in levels of acute-phase proteins in the plasma, which are observed when virus replication is still largely restricted to the mucosal tissues and draining lymph nodes (eclipse phase). When virus is first detected in the plasma (T 0 ), broad and dynamic increases in plasma cytokine levels are also observed. Within days, as plasma viraemia is still increasing exponentially, the first antibody-virus immune complexes are detected. Expansion of the earliest HIV-1-specific CD8 + T cell responses also commences prior to peak viraemia, followed by detection of the first free glycoprotein (gp)41-specific but non-neutralizing IgM antibodies. Complete virus escape from the first CD8 + T cell responses can occur rapidly, within 10 days of T cell expansion. By this time, viral reservoirs exist, possibly becoming established within days of infection. The earliest autologous-virus-neutralizing antibodies are detected around day 80 following infection, as viral loads are still declining prior to the onset of the viral set point. Antibody escape virus mutants emerge in the plasma within the following week.",

HIV-1 induces early class switching in polyclonal B cells and is associated with marked increases in the number of blood and tissue memory B cells and plasma cells, as well as a decrease in the number of naive B cells123 . In the mucosal B cell inductive microenvironments, such as Peyer's patches, where HIV and SIV replicate at high levels during acute infection 137-139 , both HIV-1 (REFS 123,139) and SIV 140 can induce the lysis of follicular B cells, massive B cell apoptosis and loss of ~50% of germinal centres within the first 80 days of infection. Early loss of germinal centres may result in defects in the ability to rapidly generate high-affinity HIV-1 antibodies and lead to a delay in the induction of autologousvirus-neutralizing antibodies.",
