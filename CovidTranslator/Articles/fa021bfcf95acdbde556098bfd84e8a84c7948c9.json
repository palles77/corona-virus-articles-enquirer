            "text": "Messenger RNA encoded signals that are involved in programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) are typically two-stemmed hairpin (H)-type pseudoknots (pks). We previously described an unusual three-stemmed pseudoknot from the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) that stimulated -1 PRF. The conserved existence of a third stem-loop suggested an important hitherto unknown function. Here we present new information describing structure and function of the third stem of the SARS pseudoknot. We uncovered RNA dimerization through a palindromic sequence embedded in the SARS-CoV Stem 3. Further in vitro analysis revealed that SARS-CoV RNA dimers assemble through 'kissing' loop-loop interactions. We also show that loop-loop kissing complex formation becomes more efficient at physiological temperature and in the presence of magnesium. When the palindromic sequence was mutated, in vitro RNA dimerization was abolished, and frameshifting was reduced from 15 to 5.7%. Furthermore, the inability to dimerize caused by the silent codon change in Stem 3 of SARS-CoV changed the viral growth kinetics and affected the levels of genomic and subgenomic RNA in infected cells. These results suggest that the homodimeric RNA complex formed by the SARS pseudoknot occurs in the cellular environment and that loop-loop kissing interactions involving Stem 3 modulate -1 PRF and play a role in subgenomic and full-length RNA synthesis.",

Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses with large genomes [$30 000 nucleotides (nt)] that serve as templates for translation of viral proteins and for replication. The production of proteins from these viral RNAs does not follow the usual rules governing translation. The first polyprotein encoded by open reading frame (ORF)1a, which encodes non-structural proteins, is defined by initiation and termination codons and is translated normally. Signals embedded within the RNA just before the termination codon of ORF1a redirect a fraction of translating ribosomes to bypass the stop codon and continue translation in the -1 reading frame, thus creating the larger ORF1ab polyprotein (1-3). These programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift (-1 PRF) stimulating signals are typically composed of a heptameric slippery site, on which the ribosome can change register by 1 nt in the 5 0 direction, followed by a pseudoknot. Slippery site sequence requirements have been characterized for several cell types (4) but the range and diversity of frameshift-stimulating pseudoknots continues to grow (5) .",

However, we and others have shown that the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) -1 PRF signal is composed of three stems [ Figure 1A ; (1, 2, 6) ]. Secondary structure predictions indicate that the potential to form the third stem is conserved among Group II coronavirus even though the RNA sequences themselves are not well conserved (1) . Interestingly, removal of the third stem from the coronavirus frameshift signal still allows for frameshifting (1, 2, 6, 7) . Thus, it is not clear what the molecular role of the additional stem-loop (Stem 3-Loop 2 [S3L2]) is, and this requires further study.",

Specifically, a hexanucleotide, self-complementary sequence in the loop capping Stem 3 raises the possibility that dimerization of the pseudoknot may play a role in viral lifecycle. While the palindromic sequence embedded in the SARS-CoV Stem 3 is not strictly conserved among severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoV), genomic sequences from Rhinolophus Chinese horseshoe bats (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV) (8) that were previously identified as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-related CoV (9) also encode the hexanucleotide palindrome.",

Here, the retroviral nucleocapsid proteins can chaperone conversion of the non-covalently linked kissing dimer to a more thermodynamically stable extended duplex-mediated dimer linkage in a structural rearrangement suggested to be associated with viral particle maturation (15) . Pioneering work on Infectious Bronchitis Virus suggested that the genomic RNA (gRNA) of CoVs is not packaged as a dimer (16) . However, CoV replication is mediated by the synthesis of a negative-strand RNA and also includes a discontinuous step involving synthesis of five to eight nested subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) intermediates (17) .

            "text": "Our previous NMR analysis of exchangeable imino protons of the SARS-CoV pseudoknot ( Figure 1A , wild-type pk) provided unequivocal evidence for the existence of Stem 3 (1). In the present study, secondary structure analysis by NMR provided further insight into the complex global architecture of the wild-type pk. To establish experimentally whether Stem 3 interacts with the two-stemmed H-type structure, we prepared a transcript lacking the base-paired region of Stem 3 while retaining the hexanucleotide 5 0 -ACU AGU-3 0 palindromic sequence ( Figure 1B , \u00c1S3 pk) and compared this construct with wild-type pk. The imino NOESY spectrum of the \u00c1S3 pk transcript is virtually identical to the wild-type pk native construct with a few marked exceptions. The missing sequential imino assignment path for the mutant \u00c1S3 pk is indicated by dashed lines in the superposition of wild-type pk and \u00c1S3 pk NOESY spectra shown in Figure 2A . For clarity, these nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) connectivities including the characteristic G38-U59 wobble pair are highlighted in the schematic secondary structure of the three-stemmed pseudoknot structure (dashed box) and correspond to Stem 3. No significant chemical shift or linewidth changes can be observed for imino protons located outside of Stem 3. The only notable exception is the severely broadened crosspeak for the G14-C25 base-pair in the \u00c1S3 pk construct located in the vicinity of the Stem 1-Stem2 junction (Figure 2A , red box). A possible explanation for this observation is that a longer unpaired Loop 3 consisting of 12 (\u00c1S3 pk) rather than 3 nt (wild-type pk) may affect the degree of overrotation at the S1-S2 junction. Addressing this question in more detail would require a complete structure determination. At this stage, the large intrinsic linewidth of a 67-nt wild-type pk RNA in combination with severe line-broadening observed for NMR samples concentrated to >200 mM made this procedure unrealistic (data not shown). However, the overall comparison of exchangeable imino proton spectra of the wild-type pk with \u00c1S3 pk suggests that Stem 3 does not noticeably engage in stable tertiary interactions involving the two-stemmed H-type structure and likely constitutes an autonomous substructure within the frameshift signal.",

We thus asked the question whether S3L2 loop-loop kissing complexes ( Figure 5B ) can potentially form extended duplexes ( Figure 5C ). Seminal work by Laughrea and Jette\u00b4have established that loose (loop-loop kissing) dimers are unstable when subjected to native electrophoresis at 25 C, while tight (extended) duplexes resist these conditions (37, 38) . As shown in lane 1 of Figures 3A  and B , S3L2 dimers, while detectable at 4 C, are not favored at 25 C, suggesting the formation of loop-loop kissing complexes.",

As compared with the native S3L2 construct, a number of exchangeable imino resonances disappeared at 283 K in the NOESY spectrum of the asymmetric S3L2-ACUucc Loop 2 mutant. The missing sequential imino assignment path for the mutant S3L2-ACUucc corresponds to the upper portion of Stem 3 and is indicated by solid red lines in the superposition of S3L2 and S3L2-ACUucc imino NOESY investigation, we attempted to monitor the conversion by NMR with nucleotide-specific resolution in the presence of only potassium chloride. Therefore, we recorded a series of consecutive one-dimensional jump-return echo NMR spectra (Figure 7) to monitor S3L2 imino proton resonances in real-time. The overlapping G43 and U48 as well as G44 and G58 imino proton resonance assignments were confirmed using 2D heteronuclear 1 H, 15 N-HMQC correlations (Supplementary Figure S1 ).

Curiously, the replacement of the 9-nt loop L2 with the stable 5 0 -cuug-3 0 tetraloop (S3-cuug, Figure 1E ) designed to stabilize hairpin formation generated a transcript that efficiently dimerized ( Figure 3A, lane 2) . The imino assignments through the stem could be easily followed based on the resonance assignments and NOE patterns observed in S3L2 (Supplementary Figure S2) . Close inspection of the sequential assignments and NOE patterns revealed the existence of tandem U-U wobble pairs involving the two uridine nucleotides of the tetraloop. In addition, substantial line broadening was observed consistent with extended duplex formation of S3-cuug transcripts (Supplementary Figure S2 ). Subsequently, we examined the NOESY spectra of the larger, three-stemmed 5 0 -cuug-3 0 -tetraloop containing SARS mutants S3-2bp-cuug ( Figure 1F ) and S3-cuug pk that were subjected to functional frameshifting analysis. We confirmed the formation of the tandem U-U wobble pairs by 2D NOESY. The NOE patterns for the U-U wobbles are an almost perfect subspectrum of the same region of the NOESY for the isolated S3-cuug transcripts (Supplementary Figure S3) . Other exchangeable protons in the Stem 1 and Stem 2 regions comprising the H-type pseudoknot overlay with the corresponding imino protons observed in the context of wild-type pk. The excellent agreement in the overlay of the imino connectivities traced by the NOESY experiments indicates that the stable 5 0 -cuug-3 0 tetraloop capping an otherwise wild-type Stem 3 facilitates the formation of extended duplex structures in the context of larger S3-2bp-cuug and S3-cuug pk mutants and locally retains the same structure as S3-cuug in isolation.",

A Loop 2 ACUucc silent (serine codon) mutation was made to investigate the role of the palindrome (S3L2-ACUucc; Figure 1D ) in promoting -1 PRF. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the sequence UCC is present at a (1). Dual luciferase measurements of -1 PRF from the S3L2-ACUucc pk construct showed a 63% reduction in frameshift stimulation compared with wild-type pk (5.7% versus 15.0%, Figure 8A ). Next, we tested two S3 mutants for frameshift stimulation in the luciferase assay. S3-cuug ( Figure 1E ), which we showed to readily self-associate ( Figure 3A, lane 2) , demonstrated a nominal increase in frameshift frequency (17.5%), while a S3 truncation of the same construct (S3-2bp-cuug, Figure 1F ) exhibited near wild-type efficiency (15.2%). It is important to note that the previously characterized S3-deletion \u00c1S3 pk construct maintained dimerization capability albeit with reduced efficiency (Figures 3B and C, lane 3) . Our results are consistent with previous analyses by three different groups that have shown mutations to the third stem of a three-stemmed pseudoknot to have less impact on frameshifting efficiency than mutations to Stem 2 (1,2,6,7). However, our data indicate that silent codon changes to Loop 2 that disrupt the palindrome play a role in regulating the frequency of frameshifting.",

Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce the Loop 2 ACUucc silent mutation into SARS subclone D (40) , and the recombinant virus mutants were recovered from full-length virus transcripts. The observed effects should therefore reflect changes related to RNA structure within the frameshifting signal, rather than modifying the encoded proteins. To determine the effects on viral growth kinetics, stocks of rescued wild-type SARS-CoV and S3L2-ACUucc pk (multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1) were used to infect VeroE6 cells, media was harvested at 0, 5 and 8 h pi and tested by plaque assay. Viral titers for SARS-CoV increased by wild-type pk \u0394S3 pk S3L2-ACUucc pk S3-cuug pk S3-2bp-cuug pk 1.00E+01 2.5 logs at 5 h pi and by 3.5 logs at 8 h pi, while the growth kinetics for S3L2-ACUucc, a mutant that does not form dimers, lagged behind at $1 log increase at 5 h pi and $2.5 logs by 8 h pi ( Figure 8B ). Our analysis demonstrates that disruption of the palindrome via silent codon changes does impede growth kinetics for S3L2-ACUucc pk at early times pi; however, by 12 h pi, similar titers were detected (data not shown).",

Total RNA was probed using a nucleocapsid specific biotinylated probe ( Figure 9A ) to examine levels of gRNA. S3L2-ACUucc gRNA levels were reduced $2-fold when compared with SARS-CoV at 5 and 8 h pi, suggesting that RNA replication contributed to the reduction in viral titers ( Figure 9B ). To determine the quantities of sgRNA species, the total RNA was enriched for poly A containing mRNA species ( Figure 9C ) before separation on agarose gel. All sgRNA species were readily detectible in both SARS-CoV and S3L2-ACUucc samples; however, $1.5-fold reduction in the quantity of sgRNA species was detected at 5 and 8 h pi ( Figure 9D ), suggesting that reduced levels of RNA transcription also contributed to the titer loss. Finally we compared the levels of ORF1a and ORF1b replicase proteins to determine if these protein levels were altered as well. Equivalent protein concentrations were probed with polyclonal rabbit antisera directed against nsp1 or nsp16 as indicated ( Figure 9E and F). Reduced ORF1a and ORF1b replicase protein levels were seen at 5 and 8 h pi but similar levels were detected by 12 h pi (Supplementary Figure S5 ). Together these data indicate that dimerization is not required for viral viability but it is important for maintaining efficient rates of virus growth and genomic and subgenomic mRNA synthesis.",

As previously shown, pseudoknots containing a structured Stem 3 can be predicted for all Group 2 coronaviruses (1). The calculated average free energy for predicted Stem 3s of Group 2 CoV is \u00c1G = \u00c06.8 \u00b1 1.2 kcal/mol. Except for Feline CoV (\u00c1G = \u00c05.6 kcal/ mol), all Group 1 sequences are not predicted to form stable Stem 3 substructures and are characterized by average free energies around zero (\u00c1G = \u00c01.4 \u00b1 1.7 kcal/mol). Similarly, in Group 3 coronaviruses the S3L2 region is most likely a single-stranded loop as indicated by a predicted \u00c1G of \u00c01.8 kcal/mol (1). Remarkably, among the predicted S3L2 structures of all 17 Group 2 coronaviruses investigated, SARS-CoV codes for the second most labile Stem 3 with a \u00c1G of \u00c04.8 kcal/ mol; only the Human CoV HKU1 Stem 3 is predicted to be less stable as indicated by its \u00c1G of \u00c04.7 kcal/mol (Supplementary Figure S7) .

Typically, G-C-rich Watson-Crick complementarity is required for stable loop-loop base pairing interactions between two RNA hairpins. Among all natural HIV isolates, two palindromic hexanucleotide sequences are most commonly found: GCGCGC and GUGCAC (49, 50) . However, mutagenesis work investigating HIV RNA dimerization also demonstrated that the GUUAAC palindrome found in SIV mnd (Simian Immunodeficiency Virus) could yield up to 20% dimers in the presence of 5 mM MgCl 2 (51) . In good agreement with those studies, we confirm that weaker palindromic sequences such as AC UAGU can readily facilitate intermolecular loop-loop kissing RNA-RNA interactions. RNA pseudoknots implicated in -1 PRF stimulation are not static and are in fact dismantled during translation (52, 53) . If a frameshift event does not occur during the first round of translation then the pseudoknot will have to refold for frameshifting to occur in subsequent rounds. Long unstructured loops between the 3 0 portion of Stem 1 and 5 0 portion of Stem 2 would be expected to reduce the chances of Stem 2 forming and reduce frameshifting efficiency. If this sequence can form a stable restricting S3L2 substructure, as is the case for the SARS-CoV pseudoknot steadied by an intermolecular kissing complex, then the rapid re-formation of Stem 2, which is required for efficient frameshifting, will be more probable.",

Deletion analysis characterizing variants with 5(6) and 11 nt (2) crossing the minor groove side of Stem 1 yielded 35 and 52% of wild-type frameshifting levels. However, because of the common lack of precise structural information for pseudoknot varaints, determining the exact contribution of specific nucleotides of the pseudoknot to frameshifting is often difficult. There is a potential pitfall in the mutational methods because longer-range distortions that are difficult to predict using e.g. Mfold especially in complicated three-stemmed architectures of Group II CoV could lead to false hypotheses regarding the physical mechanism of frameshifting.",

Surprisingly, in the context of the SARS-CoV Stem 3 sequence, 5 0 -cuug-3 0 tetraloop-capped mutants readily formed extended duplex structures as revealed by native gel and NMR analysis. Thus, the promotion of wild-type levels of frameshifting exhibited by S3-cuug and S3-2bp-cuug SARS pseudoknot variants is consistent with a mechanism involving dimer formation. The metastable SARS-CoV Stem 3 sequence, which features a G38 \u00b7 U59 wobble pair and a bulged A56, apparently evolved to facilitate a certain degree of dimerization if seeded through loop-loop kissing interactions that can even tolerate tandem U-U mismatches.",

However, while the mutant replicated to levels similar to the wild-type virus at later times pi, the inability to dimerize in infected Vero cells significantly changed the viral growth kinetics, RNA species and replicase protein levels. The fact that a silent codon change in the Loop 2 of SARS-CoV reproducibly affected the levels of gRNA and sgRNA strongly suggests that dimer formation occurs in the cellular environment and that loop-loop kissing interactions involving Stem 3 of the pseudoknot are important for accumulation of sgRNA. The in vitro findings of reduced total RNA levels and ORF1a/b protein following infection leading to a lag in replication are consistent with reduced levels of ORF1b translation products as a result of the 3-fold reduction in -1 PRF. The downregulation of the ORF1a gene product nsp1 is likely a result of the decrease in the amount of gRNA in the infected cells.",

Intriguingly, several long-distance intramolecular loop-loop kissing has also been implicated in -1 PRF stimulation. Specifically, the Group 1 Human CoV 229 E has been shown to use a kissing stem loop to promote frameshifting rather than a compact H-type pseudoknot (58) . Based on sequence alignments, such 'elaborated' pseudoknots could be used by Human CoV NL63, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (6) . Similarly, the P1-P2 pseudoknot from the luteovirus barley yellow dwarf virus can be considered a variation on the 'elaborated' CoV pseudoknot structure. It contains a loop L2 of nearly 4 kb, with S2 formed by long-range kissing interactions with nucleotides near the 3 0 end of the genome (59) . Such a long-distance RNA-RNA kissing interaction is also implicated in -1 PRF of red clover necrotic mosaic virus (60) . Thus, an intermolecular dimerization in SARS-CoV may simply represent a variation of the 'elaborated' pseudoknot.",
