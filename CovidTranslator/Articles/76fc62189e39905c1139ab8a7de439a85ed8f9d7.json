            "text": "Our understanding of host-virus interactions at the molecular level has allowed the characterization of many viral receptors at the epithelial surface. The accepted model of viral entry that is achieved using a unique viral receptor has been challenged. Instead, viruses are now thought to use host-cell moleculeswhich are referred to as attachment receptors or 'coreceptors' -in addition to the protein receptor, which is often renamed the 'principal' receptor. The dynamics of these receptors in the membrane is crucial because, on binding of the virus, receptors can be recruited to or excluded from transiently organized glycosphingolipidrich membrane microdomains, which are known as lipid RAFTS. An important class of attachment receptors has emerged recently -namely the carbohydrate chain of PROTEOGLYCANS and epithelial-membrane GLYCOSPHINGOLIPIDS (FIG. 1) . There is growing recognition of the functional importance of these biomolecules, as shown by the emergence of the field of 'glycomics' , or 'the sugar code' 1 . Indeed, oligosaccharides transfer information to complementary effector molecules, and the virus acts as a LECTIN by binding the carbohydrate as an attachment receptor. Owing to the nature of the lectin-sugar interaction (namely charge-transfer processes that are facilitated by networks of hydrogen-bond formation), environmental factors are important. These factors relate to the characteristics of the mucosal surface, which has numerous carbohydrate groups protruding into the aqueous environment and a high ionic strength.This high ionic strength is due to the charged surface lipids and their counterions. On the viral oligomeric peptide, the lectin site is characterized by the charged amino acids and the aromatic tryptophan that surrounds the galactose ring.",

Balanced haemagglutinin and neuraminidase activities are crucial for efficient viral binding to the cell surface, and for viral replication. Influenza virus haemagglutinin is one of the best-known viral lectins. Its trimeric organization increases its affinity for sialyloligosaccharide and allows the virus to bind to the surface of the epithelial cell 21 . The epithelial molecules that contain this sialyloligosaccharide carbohydrate receptor remain unknown, although they could be glycoproteins or glycosphingolipids 48 . On endocytosis of the influenza virus, haemagglutinin is cleaved into haemagglutinin 1 and haemagglutinin 2. Whereas low endosomal pH exposes the haemagglutinin 2 fusionpeptide domain, haemagglutinin 1 mediates viral fusion with the endosomal membrane 48 . Similarly, human JC virus 49 and Sendai 50 virus, as well as sialyloligosaccharide-dependent strains of rotavirus 20 and reovirus, also attach themselves to epithelial cells to block or abuse normal cell processes and, as with bacteria 43 , the surface proteins of enveloped or naked viruses bind to host-cell molecules that have receptor functions.

In the upper small intestine, galactosyl-ceramide (GalCer) + /CCR5 + /CXCR4 \u2212 epithelial cells endocytose cell-free R5 virus at the lumenal surface in a galactosyl ceramide/CCR5-receptor-mediated mechanism, whereas cellfree X4 viruses cannot enter these CXCR4epithelial cells 4 . Alternatively, R5 (or X4)-infected MONONUCLEAR CELLS bind to the epithelial cell and induce the polarized budding of newly formed R5 (or X4) viruses, which are rapidly endocytosed through GalCer that is present in raft microdomains 3, 91 . HIV transcytoses across epithelial cells to the serosal surface, where fusion of the transcytotic vesicles releases virus into the LAMINA PROPRIA. Here, R5 viruses infect the CCR5 + /CXCR4 + /CD4 + lamina propria T lymphocyte, but not the CCR5 \u2212 /CXCR4 \u2212 /CD4 + intestinal macrophage 93 .

This virus-cell interaction, which involves several species of viral surface protein, probably stabilizes raft microdomains, allowing signal transduction in the epithelial cell and endocytosis of the virus.

However, the importance of infected cells has been revisited. It is known empirically that target-cell infection is usually more efficient using cell-associated viruses, but the mechanism remains unclear. Recent data on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 3, 91 and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) 92 indicate that, by interacting with the epithelial target cell, infected cells might start to bud newly formed cell-free viral particles. These particles interact differently with epithelial cells than does an isolated cell-free virus inoculum.

            "text": "Other classes of polarized receptor. Several protein receptors have a polarized distribution, which allows viral entry into epithelial cells, or cell resistance to infection when a virus enters epithelial cells by the opposite pole. Apical viral receptors include the carcino-embryonic antigen During the first cycle of rotavirus replication in mucosal epithelial cells, the synthesis of rotaviral proteins in the cell cytoplasm leads to an increase in the plasma-membrane permeability to Ca 2+ , to activation of regulatory mechanisms and to an increase in the concentration of Ca 2+ in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The increased concentration of cytosolic Ca 2+ in infected cells promotes the activation of Ca 2+ -dependent enzymes, which in turn induces cell lysis and the release of viral proteins and viral progeny. Non-structural protein (NSP)-4 might act as a viral enterotoxin on as-yet-uninfected cells to induce secretory diarrhoea through a | Ca 2+ -dependent secretion by intestinal cells, b | Ca 2+ -dependent secretion of peptides and amines to stimulate the enteric nervous system (ENS), and c | further activation of epithelial-cell chloride (Cl -) secretion by the ENS. In parallel, released virus infects downstream absorptive cells. This will lead to a massive cell death and, as a consequence, reduction of the absorptive surface of the intestinal epithelium and an osmotic component of diarrhoea 42 . Various forms of the virus along the rotavirus-maturation pathway are shown: DLP, double-layer particle; IMP, intramembrane particle; Ins(1,4,5)P 3 , inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; PLC, phospholipase C; SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic-reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase; TLP, triple-layer particle. cell type directly involved in the pathology -rather than receptor molecules transfected in standard cell-line models -could help. It will also be important to define the environmental parameters that influence binding of the virus to its receptors, and interaction with co-receptors, especially when considering lectin-sugar interactions. The use of new techniques that involve dynamic fluorescence microscopy will help, both for mapping the viral pathway inside epithelial cells and also for studying signalling in epithelial cells. The first step of viral attachment to the cell -through either proteoglycan or glycosphingolipids -raises the question of the specific role of the glycosyl epitope, not only in viral attachment, but also in further transduction of signals. The final glycosylation state of glycoproteins and lipids varies with cell differentiation, maturation or ageing 54 , and it could govern the specificity of the virus-carbohydrate interaction that is involved in viral entry into epithelial cells. Lipid microdomains participate in the clustering of viral proteins on the viral membrane and cell receptors on the cell membranes, which favours virus-cell interactions. The spatio-temporal correlation of the different steps of the virus attachment to carbohydrates of the cell surface, and their further interaction with additional protein cell receptors or co-receptors, remains to be established.",
