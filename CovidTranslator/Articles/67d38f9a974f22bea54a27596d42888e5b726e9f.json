The effective number of codons (ENC) values ranged from 36 to 47.8, indicating a high-to-moderate codon usage bias. The highest IBV codon adaptation index (CAI) value was 0.7, indicating a distant virus versus host synonymous codons usage. The ENC 9 GC3 % curve indicates that both mutational pressure and natural selection are the driving forces on codon usage pattern in S1. The low CAI values agree with a low S protein expression and considering that S protein is a determinant for attachment and neutralization, this could be a further mechanism besides mRNA transcription attenuation for a low expression of this protein leading to an immune camouflage.",

As S is expressed in lower amounts when compared to other IBV proteins (as discussed above) and thus its synthesis relies on those tRNAs of lower availability in G. gallus cells, this could be the reason for the presence of drift in a nearly neutral evolution mode, i.e., for some S1 sequences codons there's no competition with host tRNAs and thus third positions nucleotides are not subjected to selection but might follow the whole genome GC % trend instead.",
