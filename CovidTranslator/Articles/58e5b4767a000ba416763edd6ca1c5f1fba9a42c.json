Avian-like H5N1 influenza viruses were isolated from both patients, one of whom succumbed to infection. This was the first time since 1997 that H5N1 viruses had been identified in human beings, and WHO responded by issuing a pandemic alert. Candidate vaccines were immediately sought. The recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) had been a striking example of the rapid and global spread of an emerging infectious disease. However, even the effects of SARS could be dwarfed by those that could arise with the emergence of an influenza pandemic.",

The compelling epidemiological link between the presence of the virus in poultry in live-bird markets and the appearance of H5N1 in human beings in 1997 suggested that influenza A viruses can be transmitted directly from avian species to man and can cause severe respiratory disease. [1] [2] [3] Although control of the 1997 outbreak was achieved by culling millions of birds in the Hong Kong markets, 4 this episode demonstrated that the capability for an effective global response to emerging influenza threats was poor because of technical, legislative, and infrastructural limitations. A disturbing finding that emerged from this event was that the scientific community was unable to produce an effective vaccine even after several years.",

[7] [8] [9] To overcome the high pathogenicity of the virus, polybasic aminoacids have to be eliminated. A rapid, reproducible system to achieve these modifications-ie, plasmid-based reverse genetics-has been developed only in the past 4-5 years [10] [11] [12] The potential benefits of reverse genetics for the generation and attenuation of vaccine candidates against highly pathogenic and low pathogenic influenza viruses are enormous. [13] [14] [15] However, the host specificity of the RNA polymerase I promoter used in the influenza reverse-genetics systems and the required use of an approved cell line limits the practical options for the system's use in the manufacture of human vaccines. The vaccine-candidate reference virus stock described in this report has been produced entirely on a cell substrate licensed for the manufacture of human vaccine, and as such, is-to our knowledge-the first reverse genetically derived influenza vaccine suitable for testing in clinical trials. We describe the construction of a vaccine reference virus in Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade facilities in less than 4 weeks from the time of virus isolation. Our findings highlight the speed with which new technologies can be implemented in response to influenza pandemic alerts.",

Previous experiences have shown that removal of the basic aminoacids at the haemagglutinin cleavage site substantially attenuates pathogenic influenza viruses. [15] [16] [17] Using a PCR-based mutagenesis approach, we replaced the cleavage site encoded by the haemagglutinin gene of A/Hong Kong/213/03 (H5N1) with that of the avirulent A/teal/Hong Kong/W312/97 (H6N1) (figure 1); this modified haemagglutinin gene and the neuraminidase gene of A/Hong Kong/213/03 (H5N1) were cloned individually into the vector pHW2000. 11 The two resulting plasmids and the six plasmids encoding the remaining proteins of PR8 13 were transfected into WHOapproved Vero cells under GMP conditions to rescue the vaccine seed virus, \u232c213/PR8. 36-48 h after transfection, isolated areas of cytopathic effect could be seen on the Vero monolayers. Although addition of further 1 g aliquots of TPCK-treated trypsin every 24 h led to a proportional increase in the cytopathic effect, it was not required for successful virus rescue. The candidate vaccine strain grew to high titres on subsequent amplification in eggs (haemagglutination titres of 1024-2048) and did not cause embryo death. The vaccine seed virus was unable to form plaques on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in the absence of trypsin, a trait consistent with that of influenza viruses that lack the polybasic cleavage site, and was antigenically indistinguishable from the parental H5N1 virus in haemagglutination inhibition assays. The rescued virus was fully sequenced and was identical to the plasmids used in its creation.",

Ferrets infected with A/Hong Kong/213/03 had inappetence and weight loss (figure 2), with one infected animal dying 6 days after infection and a second killed 10 days after infection because of hind-limb paralysis. Infection in these animals was characterised by viral shedding until 7 days after infection and replication of virus in the lower respiratory tract and olfactory bulb (as determined by virus isolation). In the A/Hong Kong/213/03 infected animals, there was a mild mononuclear cell infiltrate in the meninges and tracheal submucosal mucous glands and an extensive bronchopneumonia. The pneumatic infiltrate progressed in severity from the bronchi to the pleura. The bronchi and bronchioles contained sloughed necrotic epithelial cells, numerous mononuclear cells, and a few neutrophils. The alveoli were consolidated with inflammatory cells and fibrin (figure 3). By contrast, those ferrets infected with \u232c213/PR8 did not lose weight (figure 2) and seemed to remain healthy during the study (14 days) ( figure 3) . Virus was detected in the nasal washes of these animals at 5 days but not 7 days after infection, and virus was recovered from the upper respiratory tract only. By light microscopy, the meninges and trachea of the \u232c213/PR8 infected ferrets did not have an inflammatory infiltrate and only a few neutrophils were noted occasionally in pulmonary bronchi. Our results clearly show that \u232c213/PR8 was attenuated. In view of our findings, this virus can be safely handled with standard precautions in BSL2 containment facilities.",

Such passaging in eggs would occur in transition and amplification of the reference virus to vaccine stock. The rescued virus was stable on continued serial passage in embryonated eggs, and we did not detect any change in nucleotide sequence of the haemagglutinin cleavage site after 16 passages. There was no evidence of changing pathogenicity of the virus and we noted only one dead embryo at passage 15. No haemagglutination activity was evident in this egg and no embryo death was seen in passage 16, which strongly suggests that the death was not related to virus replication. Haemagglutination titres at each passage ranged from 512 to 2048 with no apparent trend of increasing or decreasing titres in subsequent passages.",

This difference is attributable to the new scientific technology available in 2003 and, just as importantly, to the infrastructure for virus surveillance in Hong Kong developed since 1997. The first case of H5N1 influenza in Hong Kong was in May, 1997; yet several months elapsed before this virus was finally characterised as an H5N1 virus. In 2003, the causative agent was identified only hours after admission of the patients to the hospital. The increased awareness, surveillance, and availability of reagents to identify influenza viruses of all subtypes bode well for the rapid identification of viruses that arise from future interspecies transfer events and for the coordination of international vaccine development by WHO. The timely distribution of candidate viruses is a very important step in the development of vaccines for pandemic emergencies. Despite the heightened security and documentation requirements for shipping and receiving potential bioterrorism agents, the H5N1 and SARS outbreaks have shown that in true emergencies, global distribution is feasible.",

Although viruses similar to A/Hong Kong/213/03 (H5N1) had been circulating in bird populations, these viruses were antigenically distinct, despite high genetic similarities (Guan Y and Peiris JS, unpublished data). That the aminoacid differences are on the globular head of haemagglutinin and seem to be responsible for much of the antigenic difference means that even a vaccine previously prepared from genetically similar precursor viruses might not provide adequate protection. We may well be faced with potential pandemic situations in the future and the rapid production of a matched vaccine will be needed-a point again highlighted by H5N1 outbreaks in 2004. Although the reference virus described in this report was prepared from a virus isolated in a similar geographic region and only a year earlier, it shares only limited antigenic cross-reactivity to the 2004 H5N1 viruses. Hyperimmune sheep serum samples produced against the purified haemagglutinin of \u232c213/PR8 has at least a six-fold reduced haemagglutination inhibitory activity against A/Vietnam/1203/04 as compared with A/Hong Kong/213/03. As our findings show, we have the technical capabilities to respond rapidly to outbreaks with a safe and stable reference virus, but there is still much to be accomplished before such viruses can be fully used in pandemic and interpandemic influenza vaccine production.",

One of the most obvious is the need for cultured cells. Although both Vero 18 and MDCK 19, 20 cells are in development as substrates for the growth of influenza vaccine, there are additional requirements for the use of cells in reverse genetics. Unfortunately, the number of suitable cell lines is very small. In addition to the regulatory requirements, the choice of cell is also limited by the technology. The plasmid based reverse-genetics systems 10 necessitates the use of cells from primate origin. The Vero cell line is probably the only option currently able to meet both regulatory and technical demands. We have shown that Vero cells can be used to successfully rescue H1N1, H3N2, H6N1, and H9N2 viruses on the PR8 backbone using the 8-plasmid system. 21 Others have demonstrated the suitability of Vero cells for alternative influenza virus reverse-genetics systems. 10 Although cultures of Vero cells are easily obtained, only cells from fully tested and licensed cell banks are likely to be acceptable for vaccine manufacture. This issue must be acknowledged and access to such cells must be incorporated as part of future pandemic plans.",

Despite the presence of low pathogenic surrogate strains, the recent human death from influenza-like illness caused by highly pathogenic H7N7 virus in the Netherlands 22 reinforces the fact that future outbreaks will probably occur in which this reversegenetics technology provides the logical-and, possibly, the only-way to respond rapidly and effectively. Although our response to the outbreak of H5N1 influenza in 2003 has shown that current scientific capabilities are sufficient to respond to the threat, there are still legal and infrastructural barriers to be overcome. 23 These barriers include licensing and intellectual property issues surrounding what is, essentially, a genetically modified organism. Yet, these difficulties are not insurmountable and pandemic scares such as the 2003 and ongoing 2004 H5N1 outbreaks are forcing commercial and regulatory parties to address these issues with some urgency. With the development of the 2003 H5N1 vaccine reference virus, and ongoing attempts to create the same for the 2004 virus, the challenge in responding to a threat of an influenza pandemic must now be supported by the largescale manufacture of the vaccine and by clinical trials of a new vaccine manipulated by reverse genetics.",
