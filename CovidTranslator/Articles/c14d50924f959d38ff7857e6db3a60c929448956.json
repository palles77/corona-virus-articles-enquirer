            "text": "McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017; Walsh et al., 2013). SG are cytoplasmic, non-membrane 40 bound aggregations of mRNA associated with translation initiation factors, the 40S ribosome 41 and RNA binding proteins. They primarily form under stress conditions that trigger the 42 phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 (Kedersha and Anderson, 2002). There 43 are four eIF2\u03b1 kinases; protein kinase R (PKR), recognizing dsRNA, PKR-like endoplasmic 44 reticulum kinase (PERK), sensing ER stress, heme regulated eIF2\u03b1 kinase (HRI) and general 45 control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2), activated by oxidative stress and amino acid deprivation 46 (Deng et al., 2002; Garcia et al., 2007; Harding et al., 1999; Lu et al., 2001). Despite PKR 47 being the assumed major kinase to activate the integrated stress response (ISR) during viral 48 infection, PERK (Cheng et al., 2005) and GCN2 (Berlanga et al., 2006) have also been found 49 to play an important role during viral infection. Phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 prevents delivery of 50 the initiator tRNA to initiating ribosomes, therefore inhibiting translation initiation and leading 51 to the accumulation of stalled 48S mRNPs. SG can also be formed independently of eIF2\u03b1 by 52 interference with the RNA helicase eIF4A, which is required to unwind the mRNA untranslated 53 region (UTR) during ribosome recruitment (Mazroui et al., 2006). This can be achieved by use 54 of the chemicals pateamine A (Low et al., 2005), hippuristanol and hydrogen peroxide 55 (Bordeleau et al., 2005; Bordeleau et al., 2006; Emara et al., 2012). SG formation occurs in a 56 multi-step process culminating in large compartments with dense cores held together by weak 57 RNA-protein interactions that can merge to form SG with multiple cores. This process is 58 driven by interactions between aggregation prone RNA binding proteins including Ras GAP 59 SH3-domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1), T-cell restricted intracellular antigen 1 (TIA-1) and 60 TIA-1 related protein (TIAR) (McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017; Protter and Parker, 2016; 61 Wheeler et al., 2016). Next a liquid-like layer is formed around the core by liquid-liquid phase 62 separation. This is achieved by interactions between RNA binding proteins containing 63 intrinsically disordered regions (IDR) and by RNA-RNA interactions (Contu et al., 2019; Lin et 64 al., 2015; Molliex et al., 2015; Van Treeck et al., 2018; Wheeler et al., 2016). SG are highly 65 dynamic, able to rapidly assemble, fuse and dissolve. They can act as storage sites for 66 mRNAs allowing rapid translation reactivation upon stress resolution or mRNAs can be 67 shuttled to sites of decay. SG are also proposed to play a role in antiviral signaling as key 68 signaling proteins including MDA5 and PKR are known to localize to SGs and SG formation is 69 involved in PKR activation (McCormick and Khaperskyy, 2017; Reineke et al., 2015).",

Firstly, we have 405 demonstrated that IBV infection inhibits both eIF2\u03b1-dependent and independent SG 406 formation. Several other viruses have been shown to inhibit SG signaling via regulation of the 407 eIF2\u03b1-dependent pathway, including Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, Zika virus, 408 West Nile virus and Junin virus (Amorim et al., 2017; Basu et al., 2017; Linero et al., 2011; 409 Sharma et al., 2017). These viruses achieve this by inhibiting activation of PKR (Sharma et 410 al., 2017) thereby preventing eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation (Linero et al., 2011) or by 411 dephosphorylating eIF2\u03b1 (Amorim et al., 2017). Zika virus was found to upregulate growth 412 arrest, and DNA-damage-inducible 34 (GADD34), a component of the protein phosphatase 1 413 (PP1) complex, and subsequent dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Amorim et al., 2017).",

Ebola virus achieves this via an interaction between VP35 and several SG 417 components including; G3BP1, eIF3 and eEF2 (Le Sage et al., 2017; Nelson et al., 2016; regulation of multiple SG signalling pathways, infection results in the formation of 422 SG in approximately 20% of infected cells. Numerous viruses are known to divert SG 423 components to sites of virus replication to benefit the virus such as poxviruses and reoviruses 424 (Desmet et al., 2014; Katsafanas and Moss, 2007). However, although not exhaustive, our 425 analysis suggests that the SG formed in 20% of infected cells are canonical SG produced in 426 response to virus replication. IBV induced SG were found to contain multiple SG marker 427 proteins and were susceptible to cycloheximide treatment, hallmarks of canonical SG. In428 addition, the SG markers did not co-localize with markers for viral RNA synthesis or particle 429 assembly. Therefore, they do not appear to resemble the virus specific granules produced 430 during the replication of other viruses. This then raises the interesting question of how SG 431 form in this subset of cells. It is possible that viral control of SG signalling may alter over the 432 course of infection. However, eIF2\u03b1 was not phosphorylated even at early time points post 433 infection and the SG positive subpopulation of cells remained constant at all time points 434 tested. Therefore, this would not appear to be the case. Other viruses have also been shown 435 previously to induce SG in only a proportion of infected cells. For example, Semliki Forest 436 virus infection resulted in SG in 63% of infected cells at 4 hpi with a further decrease after this 437 point (Panas et al., 2012). In chronic Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, an oscillation of the 438 stress response is seen in which 40% of HCV infected cells treated with interferon-\u03b1 had SG 439 but in a live time course this was shown to oscillate in a cell-specific rhythm, with 97% of these 440 cells displaying SG at some point during infection. This appears to be a strategy by HCV to 441 modulate the cellular stress response by PKR activated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation or conversely,442 dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by upregulation of GADD34 in a balancing act to prolong cell 443 survival with oscillating stalls in translation and cell division (Ruggieri et al., 2012). Therefore, 444 it is possible that in the IBV infected cells containing SG, viral regulation of eIF2\u03b1 445 phosphorylation or other SG signalling pathways is less efficient or these cells perhaps 446 represent a more complex balancing act. Another possible explanation for this subset of SG 447 displaying cells is a pre-priming of the cellular innate immunity via a paracrine signalling 448 effect, as seen with interferon (IFN) signalling in which paracrine IFN activates the JAK/STAT 449 pathway and upregulates interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). Analysis at the single cell level 450 will likely be required to tease apart the mechanism of SG formation in the subset of IBV 451 infected cells that contain them.452 453 Other members of the coronavirus family have been found to display markedly different 454 relationships with SG and their regulation. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 455 infection was shown to induce specific antiviral SG. In contrast to observations genomic RNA did not co-localize with G3BP1, these TGEV specific granules 457 feature an interaction between polypyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) and viral genomic 458 and sub-genomic RNA (Sola et al., 2011). During mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection, 459 translational shut-off and SG formation was also observed and MHV replication was 460 enhanced upon infection of eIF2\u03b1S51A -/cells or TIA -/cells in which translational inhibition 461 and SG formation are impaired, indicating an inhibitory role for SG during MHV replication 462 (Raaben et al., 2007). Similar to our observations here, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome 463 (MERS) CoV inhibits SG formation. This is achieved via an interaction between MERS-CoV 464 accessory protein 4a and dsRNA, preventing PKR activation (Rabouw et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Therefore, taken together and in agreement with our findings where IBV inhibits multiple SG 466 induction pathways, this suggests an antiviral function for SG during CoV replication.467 468 SG usually form following translation inhibition as a result of the aggregation of stalled 469 mRNPs, translation initiation factors and RNA binding proteins. Therefore, the translational 470 activity of IBV infected cells was investigated. In agreement with previous work (Kint et al., 471 2016), translation inhibition occurred during IBV replication from 12 hpi and the degree of 472 inhibition increased as infection progressed. However, only 20% of infected cells contain SG 473 and this remained constant across all time points studied. It is possible that some cells with 474 reduced translational activity are the 20% observed to contain SG. However, this would not 475 account for all the cells found to have reduced levels of translation, particularly at later time 476 points. Instead, we consider it more likely that there is an uncoupling of SG formation and 477 translational repression. Indeed we observe both processes in the absence of eIF2\u03b1 478 phosphorylation indicating altered signalling for both pathways. This situation has also been 479 observed during murine norovirus (MNV) replication where cellular translation is inhibited and 480 canonical SG assembly is blocked through repurposing of G3BP1 independently from eIF2\u03b1 481 phosphorylation (Brocard et al., 2019; Fritzlar et al., 2019). MNV translational control is 482 achieved via the phosphorylation of eIF4E by Mnk1, which in turn is activated by the p38 483 kinase (Royall et al., 2015; Waskiewicz et al., 1997). The mechanism of IBV translational 484 control is currently unknown. Other CoVs have been shown to inhibit translation through the 485 action of viral non-structural protein, nsp1, which binds the 40S ribosomal subunit and cleaves 486 host mRNA(Narayanan et al., 2015). However, IBV does not express nsp1. Instead, IBV 487 accessory protein 5b was found to be responsible for translational shut off and stability of 488 some mRNAs tested was actually increased upon IBV infection, suggesting a completely 489 different mechanism for control of cellular translation(Kint et al., 2016).",

A subsequent study by the same laboratory found that IBV infection also induced 497 phosphorylation of PERK, and the subsequent activation of ATF4 and the proapoptotic, 498 GADD153, again resulting in dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 (Liao et al., 2013). The reason for 499 the inconsistency between our current findings and the previous work is not clear although 500 one methodological difference in the current study is the use of sodium arsenite to induce 501 eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, which acts via HRI whilst the previous studies showed the activation if 502 eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in virus infected cells via activation of either PKR or PERK. Notably 503 however, in our work presented here IBV replication did not induce phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 504 at any time point and it is therefore not necessarily surprising that mechanisms to 505 dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 are also not activated. Indeed the signalling molecule required for 506 activation of PKR, dsRNA, is known to be concealed within virus induced vesicles during 507 coronavirus replication (Knoops et al., 2008). Furthermore, interferon signalling, which also 508 relies upon sensing of dsRNA is not activated in IBV infected cells until very late time points, 509 consistent with shielding of dsRNA from cellular detection (Kint et al., 2015). Therefore, the 510 activation of these various cellular signalling pathways in response to IBV infection is likely to 511 be prevented, consistent with our findings. the present study we have demonstrated that IBV replication effectively blocks both 515 eIF2\u03b1-dependent and eIF2\u03b1-independent SG signalling pathways. In addition, IBV replication 516 results in a shut-off of translation. However, interestingly in a proportion of infected cells, 517 canonical SG are formed that do not localize with sites of viral replication and do not contain 518 viral RNA. This raises the interesting future possibility of being able to study the composition 519 and function of canonical cellular SG in virus infected cells. In addition to these findings, in IBV 520 infected cells, both translational repression and SG formation were found to occur in the 521 absence of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, although IBV replication was not able to actively inhibit 522 eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. Therefore, IBV infection of cells results in a dysregulation and 523 uncoupling of several important cellular signalling pathways. The mechanism behind this 524 dysregulation remains to be determined but we have furthered our understanding of how IBV 525 changes the cellular environment to make it favorable for virus replication.",

            "text": "). Coronaviruses are positive strand RNA viruses that cause economically important diseases in humans and other species, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, SARS-coronavirus 82 (CoV) and MERS-CoV. Only a few studies have been performed on the role of SG during the replication of coronaviruses. SG were found in cells infected with Alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). Here, viral RNA was found to be targeted to SG via an interaction with polyrimidine tract binding protein (PTB) (Sola et al., 2011). SG were also 86 found in cells infected with Betacoronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Knock down of SG components, such as G3BP1 or prevention of eIF2\u03b1-phosphorylation resulted in increased 88 viral replication, suggesting SG perform an antiviral role (Raaben et al., 2007). Recently, Betacoronavirus MERS-CoV was found to inhibit SG formation via a process involving 90 accessory protein 4a interaction with dsRNA and antagonism of PKR (Nakagawa et al., 2018; Rabouw et al., 2016). Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gammacoronavirus causing infectious bronchitis, a 94 respiratory disease in poultry. It has been shown by others that early during IBV infection, eIF2\u03b1 is phosphorylated via both PKR and PERK activation. However, at later stages, eIF2\u03b1 is dephosphorylated via the upregulation of GADD153 and GADD34, promoting activity of the phosphatase PP1 (Liao et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2009). In addition, IBV is has been shown to shut off host translation in a process involving viral accessory protein 5b (Kint et al., 2016). Despite this knowledge, the formation of SG or regulation of SG signaling during IBV 100 replication and how this relates to regulation of translation has not been studied. Here, we 101 present a detailed analysis of IBV regulation of cellular SG signaling and how this integrates 102 with shut off of translation. Vero cells seeded onto glass coverslips were mock infected or infected with IBV and 116 incubated at 37 o C. After 1 hour, 1x BES (MEM, 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.2% bovine 117 serum albumin, 20 mM N,N-Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES), 0.21% 118 sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM L-glutamine, 250 U/mL nystatin, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 119 U/mL streptomycin) was added and cells incubated for the indicated time.
