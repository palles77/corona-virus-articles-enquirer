About half have enough health care workers to respond to a surge that involves #50 patients; few can handle $100 patients. Many do not have sufficient ventilators or can handle #10 additional ventilated patients. Most do not have enough National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health-approved respirators, and less than half have sufficient surgical masks to handle a significant surge. Conclusions: United States hospitals lack negative pressure, health care worker, and medical equipment/supplies surge capacity. Hospitals must continue to address gaps in infectious disease emergency planning. (Am J Infect Control 2007;35:25-32.) ",

Total costs from the 2001 U.S. bioterrorism attack that used anthrax and involved only 22 cases and 5 deaths has yet to be determined, but early estimates put the total cost at more than $2.5 billion; 1 the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak that lasted less than a year in Canada was estimated to have cost between $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion. 2 The potential consequences of being unprepared for such events are staggering. 3 Hospitals will face the challenge of caring for a large influx of patients following a bioterrorism attack or emerging infectious disease outbreak, and these patients may be contagious. Because of this, hospital surge capacity (having adequate resources for managing a sudden, unexpected increase in patients requiring acute medical care) and surge capability (having adequate specialized resources to treat specific patient groups, such as burned or highly contagious patients) must be addressed. 4 The first step in this process is to assess U.S. hospitals' preparedness for infectious disease emergencies and current surge capacity and capability. This will identify gaps that hospitals can begin to address to become better prepared for an infectious disease emergency. For the purposes of this study, the collective term ''surge capacity'' is used.",

Respondents were asked to list the state in which their hospital is located. Hospital bed size was divided into four categories: #100 beds, 101 to 250 beds, 251 to 500 beds, and $501 beds. The three surge capacity items (having enough staff to care for the increased patient load, sufficient numbers of negative pressure rooms, and sufficient numbers of ventilators) and hospital bed size provided ordinal level data because the answer options indicated incremental differences in preparedness. For instance, answers to the health care worker surge capacity question consisted of the following: (a) sufficient for fewer than 50 patients, (b) sufficient for 50 to 100 patients, and (c) sufficient for more than 100 patients. These options were considered ordinal because they indicate incremental improvements in a facility's ability to respond to an infectious disease emergency.

Similar to previously published research, this study indicates that most U.S. hospitals have a disaster plan that is coordinated with other agencies, have appropriate infection control representation on their disaster planning committee, have around-the-clock access to infection control consultation, and are participating in various types of disaster exercises. 6, 7 Although many ICPs report that their hospital has a plan for surge capacity and that this plan is coordinated with local/regional plans, a significant proportion of hospitals (approximately 20%) do not have a plan for surge capacity. This identified lack of a surge capacity plan is similar to previously published literature. 6, 7 In addition, almost a quarter of U.S. hospitals do not have plans to care for patients at an off-site/ non-health care facility, such as a community center, sports arena, or hotel; this is a necessary component of surge capacity planning as evidenced by the nation's response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. 14 A large proportion of health care facilities report that they do not have enough health care providers to accommodate an influx of any number of patients, and of those that can handle a surge, they can only manage #50 patients. This may be a reflection of the general shortage of health care providers that not only affects routine patient care, but also disaster planning. Smaller-sized hospitals report less health care worker surge capacity than do larger facilities, which is logical given that smaller hospitals have fewer staff from which to draw during a disaster. It is critical, however, that hospitals of all sizes continue to develop plans for obtaining extra staff to respond during an infectious disease emergency, because this will affect a hospital's ability to care for patients. One way to accomplish this is for hospitals to include provisions for health care worker incentives to encourage them to come to work during an infectious disease emergency, something that less than half of U.S. hospitals report including in their disaster plan.",

Another unique finding from this study is that smaller-sized hospitals have less negative pressure surge capacity and are less likely to have developed plans for the rapid set-up of negative pressure than are larger-sized hospitals. Local/regional planning efforts that aim to spread out the burden of potentially contagious patients among several hospitals by way of a coalition or in nearby facilities may aid smaller-sized hospitals in handling an infectious disease outbreak. A bioterrorism attack or outbreak of an emerging infection involving an agent that is transmitted by way of the airborne route would require the use of negative pressure rooms and would be expected to exceed hospitals' current capacity to house potentially contagious patients. It is important that U.S. hospitals of all sizes continue to develop plans for negative pressure surge capacity.",

            "text": "A significant finding from this study is the lack of ventilator surge capacity in most U.S. hospitals. Almost all ICPs report that their hospital cannot accommodate an influx of any patients who require mechanical ventilation or that their facility can handle fewer than 10 such patients. Smaller-sized hospitals have less ventilator surge capacity than do larger-sized hospitals; this is likely related to the decreased ability of many small hospitals to provide large volume intensive care. Many potential bioterrorism agents and emerging infections cause diseases that result in severe respiratory distress or failure that would require prolonged intensive care for patients, including the use of mechanical ventilation. Without ventilator surge capacity, patient care could be compromised severely and result in increased morbidity and mortality. Most U.S. hospitals also report a lack of NIOSH-approved respirators, and half do not have sufficient numbers of surgical masks to handle a 3-day influx of patients. Although ventilators, respirators, and masks will have some availability through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Strategic National Stockpile, there will be a delay before such resources are made available at the local level and the amount available might not meet the demand. The U.S. hospitals need to plan for surge capacity for ventilators, respiratory protection equipment, and other essential medical supplies until federal resources are made available. If not, significant ongoing discussion regarding altering or adjusting standards of care should become a more predominant theme.",

            "text": "For many of the hospital preparedness issues that were assessed by this survey (infection control representation on the hospital disaster planning committee, around-the-clock access to infection control consultation, and some surge capacity indicators), there are no significant differences in the level of preparedness across hospitals in relation to bed size or geographic location. Smaller-sized hospitals have less surge capacity than do larger-sized hospitals in relation to health care worker and medical equipment/supplies surge capacity, however. In addition, this study indicates that Midwest hospitals are less likely than are those in the West or Northeast to have plans for negative pressure surge capacity, and have less ventilator surge capacity. Hospitals in the South are less likely to have plans/provisions for health care worker incentives. These regional differences pose unique challenges to disaster planning because there is less ability for a hospital to rely on neighboring facilities to fill the gaps in resources and staff needed to respond to an infectious disease emergency.",

            "text": "A few limitations of this study must be noted. One limitation is the potential issue of non-responder bias. Characteristics of the non-responders or their facility could not be assessed directly, which is a common issue in survey research. It also is possible that some respondents provided information about the same hospital, which may decrease data validity and reduce sample size. There was a higher than expected response rate from ICPs in Northeastern hospitals and those in larger-sized facilities based on the American Hospital Association hospital demographics. 9 This likely is due to the increased interest and awareness surrounding infectious disease emergency preparedness in the Northeast (due to the 2001 terrorist events) and in largersized hospitals (due to the employment of more ICPs which leads to oversampling and the possible perception that these facilities will bear the largest responsibility for treating victims). Another limitation is that all ICPs were invited to participate in this survey, regardless of whether they were a member of their hospital's disaster planning committee or had any knowledge of their facility's disaster plan. The answer option,''I don't know,'' was chosen a fair amount of the time. It is not known whether the survey question items assess issues that hospital disaster planning committees are not addressing or whether the ICP who answered the survey was not a member of their disaster planning committee or was not familiar with the details of their facility's surge capacity plan. If multiple ICPs in a given hospital are collectively unfamiliar with the emergency response plans for their facility, this could indicate a further area of concern. CONCLUSION Hospital preparedness for infectious disease emergencies has become essential. This study identifies gaps in U.S. hospital preparedness and highlights the areas that are most in need of being addressed: negative pressure, health care worker, and medical equipment/supplies surge capacity. Differences between hospitals of various sizes and gaps in regional planning are outlined. The U.S. hospitals must continue to address gaps in infectious disease emergency planning.",
