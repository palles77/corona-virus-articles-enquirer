Alveolar Type II (TII) cells have immunomodulatory functions, but whether Type I (TI) cells, which comprise approximately 95% of the alveolar epithelium, also play a role in immunity is unknown. Because the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is emerging as an important mediator of inflammation, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an element of the RAS, has been implicated in lung injury, we hypothesize that TI cells can produce cytokines in response to LPS stimulation, and that this inflammation can be modulated by the RAS. Alveolar TI cells were isolated from adult Sprague-Dawley rat lungs that had been injured with an intratracheal instillation of LPS. PCR was performed to determine whether TI cells expressed transcripts for TNF-a, IL-6, or IL-1b at baseline and after lung injury. Immunocytochemical and protein analysis detected angiotensin II (Ang II) and ACE2, as well as angiotensin Type 1 receptor (AT1R) and Type 2 receptor (AT2R), in TI cells. To separate cell-specific responses, primary TI cells were isolated, cultured, and exposed to LPS, Ang II, or specific inhibitors of AT1R or AT2R. Cytokine production was assayed by ELISA. LPS stimulated the production of all cytokines, whereas ACE2 and losartan, an AT1R inhibitor, blocked elements of the LPS-induced cytokine response. Primary TI cells produce cytokines when treated with LPS, contain important components of the RAS, and can modulate LPSinduced cytokine production via the RAS, suggesting a role for TI cells in the innate immune response of the lung.",

The area of the interface is large, measuring approximately 100-150 m 2 in the human lung (1) , and is primarily comprised of two different cell types: alveolar Type I (TI) and Type II (TII) cells. TII cells, which cover 2-5% of the internal surface area of the lung, are cuboidal, with diameters of approximately 10 mm. TII cells are considered defenders of the alveolus because they produce and secrete surfactant, which aids in the opsonization of bacteria (2) . They also release cytokines and chemotactic factors that facilitate the recruitment of inflammatory cells to sites of alveolar injury (3, 4) . In contrast, TI cells, which cover the remaining 95% of the lung's internal surface area, are large, extremely thin squamous cells, with diameters measuring 50-100 mm (5) . TI cells are not thought to participate in the inflammatory response. Cultured rat TII cells that have differentiated into TI-like cells can produce interferons in response to viral infections (6) , but studies of primary TI cells are lacking, even though the extensive surface area covered by TI cells makes this the cell type most pathogens would first encounter upon entering the distal lung.",

            "text": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which is vital in the regulation of blood pressure, electrolytes, and total body volume, also plays a role in inflammation (7, 8) . Angiotensinogen (AGT) is cleaved by renin to produce angiotensin I, which is cleaved by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) to produce Ang II, the effector molecule of the RAS. Ang II can then stimulate either the angiotensin Type 1 receptor (AT1R), leading to vasoconstriction, hypertension, fibroproliferation, and inflammation, or the angiotensin Type 2 receptor (AT2R), leading to the opposite effects of vasodilation, relative hypotension, apoptosis, and fibroprotection. LPS can increase Ang II concentrations in both the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and plasma of rats (9, 10) , which may lead to AT1R stimulation and the promotion of cytokine production, thus reaffirming a role for the RAS in inflammation. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a metallopeptidase that primarily converts Ang II to angiotensins 1-7, has been reported in the alveolar epithelium (11) and is protective in acute lung injury (ALI), with recombinant ACE2 attenuating the degree of lung damage in multiple animal models of lung injury (12) . These findings, along with the fact that TI cells line the vast majority of the interface between the lung and potential environmental pathogens, led us to hypothesize that TI cells could be involved in the immune response, and that the local RAS within the lung may be one means by which TI cells could mediate inflammation.",

Limited data are available on the contribution of TII cells to BAL cytokine content, and no data are available on the contribution of primary TI cells, so we first examined cytokine expression in TI (and TII) cells of animals injured with intratracheal LPS. Transcripts for TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-1b were present in both control (uninjured) and LPS-injured TI cells. Similar results were observed in TII cells, as previously reported (4, (23) (24) (25) . Injured TI cells expressed significantly more TNF-a and IL-1b mRNA than uninjured TI cells, whereas the IL-6 mRNA expression of injured and uninjured TI cells remained similar. IL-1b can induce IL-6 production in monocytes and fibroblasts (26) , and thus the IL-1b response observed may precede that of IL-6. Nonetheless, our results demonstrate the novel finding that primary TI cells contain the necessary transcripts for cytokine production.",

Ang II is considered the effector molecule of the RAS, because it interacts with the G-protein coupled receptors AT1R and AT2R. AT1R can induce the activation of transcription factors NF-kB and activating protein 1 (AP-1) to induce cytokine expression (27, 28) , vasoconstriction, fibroproliferation, the retention of Na 1 , and the enhancement of lung injury. AT2R produces effects opposite those of AT1R stimulation (primarily vasodilation, the inhibition of cell growth, and apoptosis). Ang II can be converted to Ang-(1-7) by ACE2, and Ang-(1-7) can act on the Mas receptor to produce effects similar to those of AT2R activation. Thus a balancing of the arms of the RAS seems to occur, with ACE-Ang II-AT1R representing the injury-promoting arm, and ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-AT2R representing the injury-protective arm (29) .",

LPS can increase Ang II concentrations in certain cell types (9, 10), but whether LPS could induce TI cell Ang II production was unknown. We detected Ang II in TI and TII cells from both uninjured and injured rat lungs. Ang II staining appeared brighter in TI cells from LPSinjured animals, but was similar in TII cells from uninjured and injured lungs. We attempted to measure Ang II concentrations via ELISA of the supernatants of cultured TI cells stimulated with LPS, but our results were consistently below the detection level of the assay (1 pg/ml). Ultimately, this was not surprising, because the half-life of Ang II is approximately 0.6 minutes in plasma (30) and 15 minutes in local tissue compartments (31) . Therefore, we measured the presence of the precursor to Ang II, AGT, in TI cells. According to Q-PCR, AGT expression was 3.5fold higher in the TI cells of LPS-injured rats compared with uninjured control rats, suggesting that LPS can increase cytokine expression in TI cells by increasing AGT, which can be converted to Ang II, and Ang II can then act on AT1R to induce inflammation. Similar findings were evident in TII cells.",

An elegant study by Imai and colleagues (12) demonstrated the protective nature of ACE2 in ALI, with ACE2 2/2 mice developing more severe ALI, and recombinant ACE2 attenuating lung damage. In the LPSinjured lung, we detected approximately 50% less ACE2 transcript in TI cells than in TI cells from uninjured lungs after 18 hours, but no difference in ACE2 transcript in TII cells of LPStreated versus control animals. In murine models of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), total lung ACE2 concentrations were decreased as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) downregulated its receptor, ACE2, upon infection (32) . Although no studies suggest that LPS directly down-regulates ACE2 expression, there are data that Ang II can decrease ACE2 mRNA by 60% in certain cell types, such as astrocytes (33) . Furthermore, because approximately 35% more AT2R is present in TI versus TII cells, LPS may increase Ang II in TI cells, but Ang II may preferentially bind AT2R, decreasing AT1R stimulation, which may feed back on the system and reduce ACE2 concentrations. At the very least, this decrease in ACE2 mRNA in LPS-treated TI, but not TII, cells and the difference in AT1R and AT2R receptor densities suggest differential regulation of the RAS between the two cell types.",

Below: Tables demonstrates which reagents were added to the different series of cultured TI cells. Comparisons are drawn in reference to LPS-stimulated cells. Results are expressed as mean concentrations of cytokine (in pg/ml) 6 SEM. (A) Cultured TI cells produce a small amount of TNF-a at baseline (n \u00bc 5), but LPS stimulation significantly increased TNF-a release (n \u00bc 5). Ang II alone did not increase TNF-a concentrations. Pretreatment with ACE2 before LPS treatment did not alter TNF-a expression over baseline levels.

ACE2 pretreatment before LPS treatment inhibited IL-6 by 75.6%, compared with LPS alone (n \u00bc 6, *P , 0.05).

Conversely, the addition of the AT2R-specific inhibitor PD123319 did not produce statistically different results from those of LPS alone, which was also expected. A trend toward a decrease in IL-6 and IL-1b production was evident, but this may represent the cross-reactivity of AT2R inhibitors in the less studied angiotensin receptors AT3R and AT4R. Alternately, the downregulation of AT1R may occur with AT2R inhibition, thus reducing the inflammatory response.",

            "text": "The combination of ACE2 1 LOS before LPS stimulation was predicted to reduce cytokine concentrations in TI cells, because each agent alone decreased IL-6 and IL-1b production. TNF-a concentrations were significantly reduced by LOS, but remained unchanged with exogenous ACE2. Interestingly, TNF-a concentrations in TI cells pretreated with ACE2 1 LOS before LPS treatment were not significantly different from TNF-a concentrations in LPS-alone treated cells. However, ACE2 1 LOS significantly decreased concentrations of IL-6. IL-1b concentrations were also lower, but the decrease did not achieve statistical significance. These findings suggest that TNF-a may be more sensitive to the Ang II activation of AT1R than are IL-6 and IL-1b. Alternately, IL-6 and IL-1b may be more sensitive than TNF-a to the effects of Ang-(1-7), which can inhibit the inflammatory response. Of note, the effects of ACE2 1 LOS are not additive. In contrast, although each component alone reduced cytokine concentrations, ACE2 1 LOS increased cytokine concentrations, prompting questions of whether ACE2 may interact with LOS or modify AT1R to reduce signaling efficacy, or if LOS can independently downregulate AT1R (40, 41) . Alternately, these results suggest that AT1R inhibition may be the more biologically significant response, and that Ang II may act via other less-well characterized pathways to produce these mixed effects. ACE inhibitors or AT1R antagonists were reported to attenuate the inflammatory response in animal models of ALI (8, 42) , but similar large-scale studies in humans have yet to be performed.",

To see if the RAS acts immediately on LPS-induced signaling or if the observed effects arise from the indirect influence of the RAS on other mediators produced by LPS, we measured TNF-a and IL-6 production in the presence of LPS and LOS (10 23 M) 1 LPS at 3 hours. LPS increased cytokine expression, although at a reduced level, which was expected. The addition of LOS before LPS treatment significantly reduced the expression of both cytokines, suggesting that the RAS acts rather quickly on LPS-induced signaling. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of LPS and LOS on AT1R expression in cultured TI cells, given that some studies suggest that TLR4 activation up-regulates AT1R transcript expression (43) . We instead found that after 18 hours, LPS decreased AT1R mRNA expression, and that the decrease could be abrogated by the addition of LOS before LPS treatment. An LPS-induced decrease in AT1R expression was observed by other investigators in whole rat lungs (21) and in human mesangial cells (44) . These findings suggest that LPS may induce a feedback inhibition of AT1R to prevent unbridled inflammation, and that LOS disrupts this feedback loop. Future studies will need to determine whether AT1R mRNA expression translates into similar protein results.",

A B C Figure 7 . Insights into RAS modulation of TI cell inflammation. (A) LOS decreased LPS-induced TNF-a production within 3 hours. Cultured TI cells were treated with serum-free medium alone, 10 mg/ml LPS, or LOS (10 23 M) 1 LPS. TNF-a secretion was assayed via ELISA. LOS decreased LPS-induced TNF-a by 90% within 3 hours (*P , 0.05). (B) LOS decreased LPS-induced IL-6 production within 3 hours. Cultured TI cells were treated with serum-free medium alone, 10 mg/ml LPS, or LOS (10 23 M) 1 LPS. IL-6 secretion was assayed via ELISA. LOS decreased LPS-induced IL-6 production by 58% in as early as 3 hours (*P , 0.05). (C) LOS disrupts feedback inhibition of AT1R transcript expression. AT1R mRNA concentrations were measured via Q-PCR in cultured TI cells treated with LPS or LOS (10 23 M) 1 LPS for 18 hours. Control cells (Con) were treated with serum-free medium. A 42% reduction was evident in AT1R transcripts in LPS-treated cells compared with control cells, and this reduction was corrected by the addition of LOS (10 23 M) before LPS treatment (n \u00bc 3, *P , 0.05). Data are expressed as fold expression of AT1R mRNA over control values 6 SEM, and all values were normalized to 18S.",
