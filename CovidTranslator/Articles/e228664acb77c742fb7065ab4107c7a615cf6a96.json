The chemical structures of all compounds were fully characterized by elemental analysis and spectroscopic techniques. The results of the bioassays indicated that compounds Id, Ie, If and IIf proved inhibitory against influenza virus A (EC 50 = 13 -27 mg/mL for strain H1N1 and 9.3 -18 mg/mL for strain H3N2). Compounds Ig and IIg were the most cytostatic compounds with inhibition of HeLa cell proliferation at an IC 50 = 0.3 mg/mL for Ig and 1.9 mg/mL for IIg. Especially, compound Ig showed the highest cytostatic activity with IC 50 of 0.30, 0.70 and 2.50 mg/mL against HeLa, CEM and L1210 cell lines, respectively. This inhibition range was within the same order of magnitude as that for cisplatin. Furthermore, molecular modeling was carried out to examine the cytostatic activity and determine the best pharmacophore model as a guide for the design and development of potential prodrugs in future studies.",

[1] first reported that thiosemicarbazone pharmacophore had antituberculosis activity. Then, antiviral activity of benzaldehyde thiosemicarbazone derivatives against vaccina virus in mice was found by Hamre, et al. [2] . The antiviral activity of isatin-b-thiosemicarbazone (IBT) and N-methyl-isatin-b-thiosemicarbazone (commercially known as Methisazone or Marboran) was widely investigated against orthopoxviruses in the 1960s [3] . After these discoveries, thiosemicarbazones draw considerable interest due to their application in the pharmaceutical chemistry and proved to be chemotherapeutic agents potentially useful for inhibiting cancer cells [4] . For example, 3-aminopyridine-2carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone (commercially known as Triapine) inhibited the biosynthesis of DNA in murine leukemia L1210 cells by blocking the activity of ribonucleotide reductase [5] .",

Pharmacophore hybridization is a method of rational drug design, and a single molecule containing different modes of action can be beneficial for the treatment of diseases. As an important pharmacophore, bis-alkylating nitrogen mustard such as chlormethine, melphalan, chlorambucil and many more have anticancer activities against hematologic tumors, myeloma, ovarian cancer and solid tumors [7] . Alkylating agents are electrophilic entities that interact with nucleophilic moieties of DNA resulting in the covalent transfer of an alkyl group. Another pharmacophore para-substituted aryl nitrile, which is bioisostere of a ketone group, has a variety of anticancer activities, e.g., against hormonally-responsive breast cancer (letrozole), breast cancer (neratinib), prostate cancer (bicalutamide), pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer (L-778,123, phase I), and chronic myelogenous leukemia (bosutinib, SKI-606, phase III) [8] .",

Assignments of selected diagnostic IR bands provided significant indication for the formation of the thiosemicarbazone deriva-tives. All thiosemicarbazone derivatives (Ia-g and IIa-g) exhibited two intense bands in the region of 3396 -3266 cm -1 and 3162 -3120 cm -1 due to n(N-H) stretching. The strong band at 839 -818 cm -1 was present due to n(C=S) stretching. It was suggested that thiosemicarbazones in the solid phase remain in the thione form. In addition, the characteristic azomethine stretching vibrations n(C=N) at 1587 -1543 cm -1 were observed, which also confirmed the formation of thiosemicarbazones [16] . Results of the 1 H NMR integrations and signal multiplicities were in line with the proposed structures and other spectral data. The 1 H NMR spectra of Ia -Ig and IIa -IIg showed a singlet peak attributable to the =N-NH proton in arange of d = 12.60 -11.62 ppm as well as a singlet peak attributable to the PhNH proton in the range d = 10.80 -9.92 ppm. The signal of the azomethine proton (HC=N) appeared as a singlet at d = 8.63 -8.04 ppm [16] . All aromatic protons were observed with the expected chemical shift (d = 8.48 -6.80 ppm) and coupling constant in the NMR spectra of all thiosemicarbazone derivatives. The 13 C NMR spectra of the thiosemicarbazones exhibited two important signals at d = 176.92 -174.23 and at d = 143.89 -142.57 ppm assigned to thioamide (C=S) and imine (C=N) carbon atoms, respectively. The signals at d = 164.01 -112.06 ppm in the spectra were assumed to be due to the aromatic carbons. The MS spectra of all thiosemicarbazones were in line with the proposed structures.",

The IC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration) was defined as the concentration of the compound that inhibited cell proliferation by 50%. Cisplatin was purchased from SIGMA and used as a reference drug. Compound concentrations of 100, 20, 4, 0.8, 0.16 and 0.032 mg/mL have been tested (5-fold dilutions) and the data represent the mean \u00b1 SD (standard deviation) of at least two to three independent experiments.

For this reason, we again applied computational methods and ligand-based pharmacophore modeling to evaluate this state. The new derivatives of thiosemicarbazones (Ia -Ig and IIa -IIg) were drawn and converted from 2D to 3D, and the PM3MM basis set was assigned and then minimized using a semi-empirical method with the aid of Gaussian09 program package. A conformational search of the ligands was carried out using BEST algorithm for 3D pharmacophore generation. The Auto Pharmacophore Generation protocol in Discovery Studio 3.5 was used based on a bioactive conformation. In this study, we used compound Ig as the bioactive conformation with IC 50 values between 0.30 and 2.50 mg/mL. The pharmacophore models were generated based on the main features of compound Ig. These features were Hb-Acceptor, Hb-Donor, Hydrophobic and Ring Aromatic in the pharmacophore models. Besides, the Genetic Function Approximation (GFA) model for the selectivity of pharmacophores was used. The best model was determined with the help of Clusters pharmacophores subprotocol. The model contains six features, representing two hydrophobic (cyan), two ring aromatic (orange), one hydrogen bond donor (pink) and one hydrogen acceptor (green).",

The fact that the activity of Ig against Coxsackie virus B4 was only observed in one cell line (monkey kidney Vero), but not in another cell line (human cervix carcinoma HeLa) led us to conclude that this compound should not be considered as a consistent new antiviral lead agent.",

This unusual selectivity between tumor cell lines should be further investigated. In fact, the I series of compounds were often somewhat more cytostatic than their corresponding II series of compounds.

Especially Ig with a bis(2-chloroethyl)amino moiety, the IC 50 values (0.30 -2.50 mg/mL) were the lowest (most effective) among all compounds and compared to cisplatin as a reference compound. A two-tailed, unpaired t-test (GraphPad Prism) revealed no significant difference between the cytostatic inhibition values of Ig and cisplatin obtained against the three tumor cell lines (p = 0.647). The results showed that compounds Ia -Ig containing electron-withdrawing group, such as -CN located at the para position of the benzene ring, increased the cytostatic activity, according to the electron-donating group (-SCH 3 ) at the same position of the structure (like compounds Synthesis, Biological Evaluation and Ligand 147 IIa -IIg). Furthermore, the introduction of electron-donating groups (-OH, -OCH 3 ) at the para position of the benzene ring weakened the cytostatic effects. While the same situation for electron-withdrawing groups (-F, -NO 2, -CF 3 ) was also observed, compound IIb exhibited moderate activity against all tumor cell types. Besides, compound 1g displayed the better cytostatic activity than its analog compound IIg, which has an electron-donating group (-SCH 3 ) at the para position. These results indicated that the introduction of the bulky alkylating group (bis(2-chloroethyl)amino) and a cyano group reinforced the cytostatic activity. The pharmacophore model ( Fig. 2A ) was hypothetically superimposed with compounds Ig (fit value 4.6216) and IIg (fit value 3.0032). Figures 2B and 2C summarize the results of model fitting obtained for compounds Ig and IIg. The other compounds were not superimposed to fit with the best model. In addition to comparing the results of modeling with experimental data, they show compatible and significant trends. It is established that Hb-acceptor (-CN; -SCH 3 ), hydrophobic groups (-N(CH 2 CH 2 Cl) 2 ), and 3D-conformations are responsible for the cytostatic activity of compounds such as Ig and IIg, according to ligand-based pharmacophore modeling. Especially, 3D-conformation of the investigated compounds showed the major effect in this study. Unfortunately, compounds Ia -If and IIa -IIf did not show any activity in comparison to compounds Ig and IIg. The proposed methods were able to provide valuable information about key features and interactions that are important for the biological activity of compound Ig. Thus, ligand-based pharmacophore modeling was increasingly successful in delineating why compound Ig displayed better cytostatic activity than compound IIg. ",
