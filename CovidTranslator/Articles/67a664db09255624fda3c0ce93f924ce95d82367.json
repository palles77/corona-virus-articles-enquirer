            "text": "The study also underscores the potential risks of immunosuppressive agents from an infectious standpoint. The mechanism for immunosuppression by FK506 involves ligation to FK506-Binding Protein 12 (FKBP-12) to form a complex which binds and inhibits calcineurin from binding nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT). The phosphatase activity of calcineurin dephosphorylates NF-AT, which joins its nuclear subunit to modulate gene transcription and T-cell activation. Calcineurin also masks the nuclear export signal of NF-AT. The neuroregenerative effects of FK506, however, may be the result of a separate mechanism mediated by FKBP-52 and involving c-jun expression. 32 Yoo et al. have identified genes in the SDAV genome coding for a spike protein, a small membrane protein, a membrane-associated protein, a nucleocapsid protein, and an esterase protein. 33 Further molecular studies may answer the question of whether viral structural proteins interact with the neurogenic and/ or immunosuppressive mechanisms of FK506. The earlier onset of weight loss in FK506 treated animals versus untreated animals likely relates to FK506 induced immunosuppression, which is associated with increased susceptibility to viral infection. Compared to untreated rats, immunosuppressed rats had a more fulminant course with earlier onset and more severe illness, likely due to higher viral titers in the context of compromised lymphocyte function. There also exists the possibility that secondary bacterial infection developed in some animals, although the clinical findings were pathognomonic for SDAV infection in affected animals. The positive effect of FK506 on neuroregeneration documented in numerous studies was negated by infection. The premature death in one of the infected animals receiving FK506 supports the hypothesis that mortality and morbidity due to SDAV and other infectious agents is intensified by the burden of immunosuppression. 18 The walking track analysis of both groups of rats infected with SDAV demonstrated a significant delay in functional recovery. This was an expected finding, given the very limited regeneration (and therefore minimal muscle reinnervation) observed in infected animals. Although walking track analysis is less precise than morphometry, it is an important outcome measure because it actually evaluates recovery of function, rather than regeneration (which is necessary, but not sufficient for recovery of function). The erratic pattern of the walking track data is typical of this assay, given inherent imprecision of this technique. Nonetheless, the particularly high baseline print length factor day 7 of the SDAV infected group Figure 3 . Quantitative histomorphometric analysis of tibial nerve fiber regeneration after nerve transaction at 18 days. Comparisons of nerves from SDAV infected and healthy animals showed statistically significant reduction in fiber counts, percent nerve tissue, and nerve density was observed with SDAV infection (P < 0.05). Mean fiber width did not differ significantly between groups. Error bars reflect standard deviation. treated with FK506 (which exceeded 1.5), is notable. Most likely, these animals were quite sick at this time point, dragging their hindlimbs even more than is normally seen with complete nerve transaction.",

Although a practical necessity, this approach introduces the theoretical concern that another factor in addition to viral infection may have contributed to poor nerve regeneration. Retrieving the raw data from three separate cohorts of rats of the same species, age, and endpoint helps mitigate concerns regarding validity of the control group. The pooling of animals from different studies does explain the relatively wide standard deviation in controls. Another limitation is that the sacrifice of animals at day 18 precluded a long-term assessment of whether there would have been ''catch up'' regeneration long after the infection was cleared. The sacrifice of animals at day 18 was based on prior literature on optimal timing of walking track analysis and desire to minimize suffering of any animals with residual disease related to SDAV infection. Applicability of the findings reported here to other viral illnesses or other strains of rats is uncertain. All study and control animals were male Lewis rats. Last, the difficulty in correlating precise onset of infection combined with the fragmented data on weight loss precluded statistical analysis of differences in weight loss for immunosuppressed versus immunocompetent animals infected with SDAV.",
