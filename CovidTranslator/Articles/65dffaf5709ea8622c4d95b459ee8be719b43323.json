The model provides a testable hypothesis by considering a dynamical equation for the contact parameter, which drops exponentially with time, simulating control measures. We discuss the role of modelling in public health and we analyse the distinction between forecasting and projection models as assessing tools for the estimation of the impact of intervention strategies. The model is applied to the communities of Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada) and it mimics those epidemics with fairly good accuracy. The estimated values for the basic reproduction number, R 0 , were 1.2 for Hong Kong and 1.32 for Toronto (Canada). The model projects that, in the absence of control, the final number of cases would be 320,000 in Hong Kong and 36,900 in Toronto (Canada). In contrast, with control measures, which reduce the contact rate to about 25% of its initial value, the expected final number of cases is reduced to 1778 in Hong Kong and 226 in Toronto (Canada). Although SARS can be a devastating infection, early recognition, prompt isolation, and appropriate precaution measures, can be very effective to limit its spread.",

To prevent and to intervene, however, one must predict. To predict the natural course of a system in the absence of intervention and to predict what is going to happen to such a system after the proposed intervention. Prediction, on its side, is strongly dependent on the scientific foundations of the subject in question. In this sense, mathematical models have provided a precise template against which new observations or theories can be tested as understanding of the phenomenon develops [1] . 0306 Three major aims of mathematical models in epidemiology can be identified: the first centres on the need for scientific understanding and precision in the expression of current theories and concepts; a second aim, linked to the first, is the role of theory in identifying areas in which better epidemiological data is required to refine prediction and improve understanding; and the third, and in many instances, the most difficult objective is that of prediction [1] . In addition to these three aims of modelling we propose a fourth objective: the generation of testable hypotheses by providing a theoretical framework on which plausible scenarios can be simulated in a computer environment (in silico experiments).",

The same community was simulated with the line expressing the ''Natural Course'' of the epidemics calculated with j = 0, simulating the absence of control. to about 25% of its initial value, the expected final number of cases is reduced to 1778 in Hong Kong and 226 in Toronto (Canada). In fact, the stability level predicted by the model was indeed attained in both Hong Kong and Toronto (Canada) by the end of the outbreaks. Note that the model's performance should be taken with some caution, since there are some constraints that could influence our results. The first one is the assumption of homogeneously mixing pattern of transmission. In fact, this is a simplification that does not take into account the fact that SARS occurred mainly as focal outbreaks, with a concentration of cases in small communities somewhat related. This simplification may overestimate the projections of the natural course of the epidemics. However, the qualitative results are not affected, that is, by introducing in the model the parameter j in Eq. (5), which reduced the contact rate, we were able to reproduce the change in the natural impetus of the epidemics. The second constraint of the model is the deterministic nature of the model, that is, we considered only the average values of each variable and parameter (the mean field approach). However, the size of the epidemics and the affected populations justify the deterministic approximation.",

The test consisted in reproducing the course of the epidemic along its temporal evolution by mimicking the contact reduction in the parameter b, as compared with the absence of intervention. The model reproduces the temporal evolution of the epidemics with good accuracy and suggests what would have happen if the control measures were not implemented. Therefore, our model is not a forecasting model but rather a projection one. This distinction is an important one, in particular concerning the concept of validation. Forecasting models can be tested by comparing their predictions with actual data. Projection models should be seen in a counterfactual way, that is, their projections cannot be tested because they will never happen.",

This phenomenon can be seen in the curves of Fig. 3 , which display the time evolution of the number of secondary cases.
