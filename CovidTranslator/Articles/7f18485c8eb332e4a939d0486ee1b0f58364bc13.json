            "text": "Background: Premature coronary artery disease (CAD) is a special entity with a strong link to familial hypercholesterolemia, family history of premature CAD, or multiple coexistent atherosclerotic risk factors. Drug-eluting stenting (DES), including paclitaxel-eluting stenting (PES) and sirolimus-eluting stenting (SES), has been proven to have a lower restenotic rate. However, to date, few studies have investigated the clinical and angiographic results of DES in premature CAD patients. Methods: Between February 2004 and October 2005, premature CAD patients, defined as those younger than 50 years of age, who were treated with DES in our medical center were all retrospectively enrolled. Their baseline clinical characteristics, clinical outcome and angiographic follow-up results were analyzed. Results: A total of 26 patients (M/F: 23/3) were enrolled, with a mean age of 44 \u00b1 6 years (range, 24-50 years). Conventional atherosclerotic risk factors were prevalent in this study group, including diabetes mellitus (35%), hypertension (35%), hyperlipidemia (54%) and smoking (73%). Moreover, there was 1 homozygous and 1 heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia case in our study group. In terms of angiographic results, there were 40 target lesions in 34 target vessels. Forty DES (39 PES, 1 SES) were implanted with a median stent diameter of 3 mm and median length of 24 mm. The clinical follow-up was counted up to May 2006, with a mean follow-up duration of 540 \u00b1 168 days; 11 (42%) patients had a second angiogram during the follow-up period (200 \u00b1 98 days after DES). None of the patients had target lesion revascularization (TLR). In addition, there was no difference in TLR or stent thrombosis between patients with or without acute coronary syndrome. Conclusion: Based on our single-center experience, DES had good short-term follow-up results for a premature CAD group with diverse and multiple atherosclerotic risk factors.

Moreover, the impact of premature myocardial infarction (MI) or CAD on the young patient and his/her family is particularly devastating. Fortunately, the incidence of MI and symptomatic CAD in young adults is low; most studies show that only about 3% of all CAD cases occur under the age of 40. 1, 2 The fact that clinically manifest CAD in the young adult is relatively uncommon implies that these patients are atypical of the general population. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Cigarette smoking has been shown to be the single factor most strongly associated with CAD in young adults. 9 Kannel et al found that in patients included in the Framingham",

One was a homozygous 24-year-old woman who presented with baseline total cholesterol of 520 mg/dL, tendon xanthomas, left main and triple-vessel coronary disease and carotid artery stenosis. She was treated with both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and plasma LDL apheresis. 19 SES was implanted in the left main ostium and a PES in the right coronary artery. However, no skin biopsy was done to confirm the diagnosis by measuring LDL receptor activity in the cultured skin fibroblasts of this patient. 20 Another limitation is that there was no followup coronary angiogram in this case. The other patient was a heterozygous 34-year-old man with baseline total cholesterol of 400 mg/dL, ischemic resting electrocardiogram and strong positive treadmill exercise test results. Coronary angiogram showed triplevessel coronary disease, and he was treated with a total of 5 PES in 2 PCI sessions. A radionuclide exercise myocardial perfusion scan was performed 5 months later that disclosed negative ischemic response on electrocardiography and scan, indicating good therapeutic results.",

            "text": "The study was based on a retrospective analysis of a single center's catheterization databank and thus limited by a small sample size. The clinical implications of our study are also limited by the DES brand selected (98% PES) as well as gender bias (88% male). Another limitation is that only 42% of the studied patients had a second coronary angiogram during the follow-up period. Moreover, 35% of studied patients presented with acute MI. According to the literature, young-age acute MI is associated with more thrombus and less plaque and thus an inherent lower restenotic rate. 21 Another shortcoming of this study was the lack of an older-age control group that received DES treatment in the same study time frame. The mean number of atherosclerotic risk factors was 3 \u00b1 2 in our study, and 63% of the treated lesions were ACC/AHA class C. Though most of the treated lesions were complex and the clinical scenarios were high risk for restenosis, our short-term follow-up results disclosed only 2 target vessel failures (5.9%). The results are compatible with most published clinical trials in high-risk subsets. 14, 15 Our study results indicate that young age or premature CAD is not a limitation to DES-based PCI in current practice. Moreover, recent results from the COURAGE trial by Boden et al emphasized the importance of risk factor modification for the treatment of stable angina pectoris. 22 Our study results on young premature CAD subjects again proved this notion as all our patients with hypercholesterolemia were put on HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment during the clinical follow-up period.",
