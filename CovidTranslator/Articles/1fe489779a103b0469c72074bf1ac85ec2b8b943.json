Epidemiological findings indicated that these cases of inhalational anthrax most likely occurred through aerosols generated when opening or processing letters containing B. anthracis powder. There is some evidence that these attacks may have been carried out by a US scientist, although their exact background and circumstances remain officially unresolved until now.

Preparations were made for such a program, such as training of medical staff to conduct the vaccinations, etc. Compared to other vaccines currently in routine use, smallpox vaccination using vaccinia virus entails a considerable rate of side effects. Based on previous experiences, 1 in 1,000 vaccinees will develop a serious illness requiring symptomatic medical treatment, and there will be about 30 cases of permanent damage and 1-2 deaths per million vaccinees [10, 15] . In addition, it is likely that during a mass vaccination program, some individuals, who have unrecognized contraindications, will receive the vaccination, increasing the rate of complications further. Transmission of the vaccinia virus to contacts with or without contraindications is another risk.",

Particularly categories B and C may be of interest to bioterrorists, due to the fact that some of these agents are not as infectious as those in category A and that dealing with them is, therefore, much easier. For example, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis is relatively easy to cultivate at a relatively low biohazard level, and with its incubation period between weeks and years it would be very difficult for public health systems to realize that a large number of patients were the result of a bioweapon attack. However, the insidious course might compromise its terrorising effect. On the other hand, Marburg or Ebola viruses are, despite their fearsome reputation, rather unsuitable, not only because those involved in their propagation are likely to succumb to them before achieving their goals, but also because of their low ability to survive outside the human body. Efforts are underway to develop refined methods for assessing the suitability of biological agents as bioweapons [6] .",

Although there is no evidence that the virus was introduced deliberately, it nonetheless would represent an extremely effective biological weapon. Despite intensive control efforts, WNV has now firmly established itself in the Americas, spreading across the continent and reaching the West coast, and so far has caused almost ten thousand of cases of clinical illness and hundreds of deaths in humans in the United States alone [11] .

In the first half year of 2003, a novel infectious disease termed severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) impacted significantly on the medical and scientific world.

While being held prior to sale to the public, these animals appear to have been infected through contact with Gambian giant rats and other animals originating in Ghana that were carrying the monkeypox virus [16] . Thus, the obviously badly conducted and poorly regulated international trade in wild animals was responsible for the introduction of a potentially very harmful pathogen from West Africa into the United States-at a time when mass vaccinations against smallpox were undertaken in military personnel and were (albeit with little success due to wide-spread refusal) envisaged for large numbers of civilians! Again, there is no evidence that anything but human ignorance and greed were at play, but this event again shows the potential for a bioweapon attack [12] .",

Therefore, genetically modified bioweapon agents have been classified as a separate category (advanced biological warfare agents, ABW) [25] . In addition to increasing a pathogen's virulence [23] , its ability to survive under different environmental conditions such as high temperature, ultraviolet radiation and desiccation could potentially be improved (Table 2) ; by enhancing dissemination, this might make some hitherto rather unsuitable candidate agents such as filoviruses more likely to be utilized.",

Therefore, new initiatives to deal with broader threats that may result from misuse of technology need to be pursued, in parallel with existing and planned programs. Ultimately, whenever novel infectious agents appear suddenly, it is probably inevitable that there will be speculations and rumors: that they were designed in biowarfare laboratories or emerged from biomedical research (as was argued for HIV), that they came from space (as suggested for SARS), or that they represent a bioterrorist attack.
