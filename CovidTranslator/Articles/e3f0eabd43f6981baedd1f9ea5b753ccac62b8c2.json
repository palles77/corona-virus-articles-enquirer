During spermatogenesis, precursors resembling typical somatic cells undergo complex and extensive biochemical and morphological transformations. These include flagellar formation, elimination of cytoplasm, complete repression of gene expression, cessation of replication and mitosis and highly compact packaging of nuclear DNA. Unlike nuclei of terminally differentiated cells, however, the nucleus of the fertilizing sperm must be reactivated. This occurs upon transfer to egg cytoplasm at fertilization, as it is transformed into a male pronucleus and eventually combines with the egg nucleus.",

In addition, sperm DNA is packaged by very different types of proteins in different organisms, and a seemingly bewildering variety of special proteins has evolved to this endL This stands in stark contrast to the relative conservation of basic histone structure of somatic eukaryotic chromatin. Several recent studies, which will be described in this review, have led to the development and testing of an integrated model for packaging and unpackaging sea urchin sperm chromatin. The most obvious biochemical alteration involves reversible phosphorylation of a set of tandemly repeated, basic tetrapeptide Two species of histones in sea urchin sperm (Sp H1 and Sp H2B) are chimeric molecules whose highly basic amino-terminal domains are dephosphorylated at the last stage of sperm cell differentiation, and rephosphorylated immediately following fertilization. The phosphorylated regions consist largely of repeating tetrapeptides with two basic residues flanking Ser-Pro residues ('SPKK' motifs) and are predicted to have ~-turn secondary structures. Alteration of the charge and structure of the SPKK sites may play a role in the unusually dense DNA packaging of the mature sperm chromatin. The motif resembles the target site of cell-cycle-associated cdc2 kinases and is found in several other proteins whose nucleic acid affinities may be altered during the cell cycle. elements in the amino-terminal regions of two male-germ-line-specific histones (Sp H1 and Sp H2B) 2-5. The basic charge of these clustered sites in the termini of the histones is essentially neutralized upon multiple phosphorylation. This is believed to drastically lower the affinity of these regions for DNA, altering chromatin physical properties and packaging.",

However, the chromatin differs from somatic chromatin in several significant ways ~,5. With 100-110 base pairs of linker DNA between cores, it has the highest nucleosomal repeat length ever reported. Two of the five histone classes are restricted to the male germ line. These Sp histones (Sp H1 and Sp H2B) are larger than their somatic counterparts, which are completely absent from sperm. The sperm chromatin contains little or no non-histone protein or RNA and is completely inactive in RNA and DNA synthesis. It is exceptionally stable to thermal or ionic denaturation of its DNA, is more resistant to linker digestion by micrococcal nuclease than somatic chromatin and is more densely packed than mitotic chromosomes.",

The genes are similar in structure and expression to typical cell-cycle-regulated somatic his-tone genes.

The only change in histone composition observed in Sp histonos during sea urchin spermatogenesis occurs in the terminal stages 7. As the highly condensed late spermatid nucleus is transformed to the mature sperm nucleus, the Sp histones, which were highly phosphorylated throughout spermatogenesis, become dephosphorylated ( Fig. 1 ). Following fertilization, the same molecules are immediately and specifically rephosphorylated 2. This process occurs before decondensation of the compact chromatin, or reactivation of replication and transcription. Within hours of fertilization, the Sp histones brought by the sperm to the zygote are replaced or diluted by a programmed succession of embryo histone subtypes ~ (Fig. 1 ). Virtually all phosphorylation of Sp histones during spermatogenesis occurs in the amino-terminal regions of the molecules, exclusively on Set residues 7. Following fertilization, the same regions are rephosphorylated and, in addition, the carboxy-terminal region of Sp H1 is highly phosphorylated 2. The kinases responsible for phosphorylation of Sp histones are unknown. No histone kinase activity has been found in the mature sperm, but candidates have been found in egg cytoplasm s'9.",
