A few of COVID-19 patients with conjunctivitis, or even as the first symptom, make the early diagnosis and effective protection a great difficulty. A recent research has demonstrated that SARS-COV-2 can be detected in the conjunctival sac of patients with COVID-19 patients or suspected. 5 However, none of these patients had ocular symptoms. We therefore conducted a study to describe the clinical spectrum of ocular symptoms and laboratory test in conjunctival swab samples, we found a rare case of nosocomial SARS-COV-2 infection with conjunctivitis in a nurse, which suggests that ocular transmission may be a potential route of nosocomial transmission of the SARS-COV-2.",

Briefly, a 29-year-old nurse working in the Emergency Department at Tongji hospital, Wuhan City, China was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology at Tongji Hospital on February 1st, 2020 due to excessive tearing and redness in both eyes (Fig. 3A) .

The ocular examination revealed conjunctival congestion and watery discharges in both eyes with normal best corrected visual acuity, normal corneal epithelium, quiescent anterior chamber and no tenderness or enlargement of the preauricular lymph node.

However, SARS-CoV-2 was found in ocular discharges by RT-PCR only in one COVID-19 patient. Although the incidence of conjunctivitis is extremely low, these results demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 have shown a capacity to use the eye as a portal of entry and cause ocular disease. To our knowledge, several anatomical and mucosal immune properties permitted the eye as both a potential site of virus infected site as well as a gateway for respiratory infection. [12] [13] In coincidence with our result, SARS-CoV was detected by RT-PCR in tear samples from three probable cases. 14 Resemble as SARS-CoV, entry of SARS-CoV-2 via the host functional receptor is mediated by ACE2. 15 Moreover, Sun and colleagues 16 found that ACE2 expressed in human cornea and conjunctival tissues, which providing strong evidence for our diagnosis.",

A recent bioinformatics analysis study analyzed 4 datasets with single-cell transcriptomes of lung, oesophagus, gastric, ileum and colon, and SARS-CoV-2 was found in stool samples of patients with abdominal symptoms. 9 Moreover, Lofy KH et al 10 detected the SARS-COV2 in a patient's stool, which warns us of the risk of fecal oral transmission. Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 was also directly detected in the oesophageal erosion and bleeding site in a case with severe peptic ulcer symptom reported by Zhong et al. 11 Therefore, the real spread route is still a mystery, other transmitted ways should be further studied and confirmed.",

The negative results of conjunctival sac in other 71 patients, may be owing to the lower viral concentration, the sampling time lag, and the lower positive rate of the inefficient diagnostic method. Ziad and colleague 18 found that tracheal aspirates yielded significantly higher SARS-CoV loads, compared with the nasopharyngeal swab and sputum specimens. This suggests that the viral concentration and genome fraction is diverse in different sites. In consideration of the ocular surface is an open microenvironment, and the viral may transport to the inferior meatus of the nose rapidly, 19 the SARS-CoV-2 concentration in ocular surface is likely to be very low. We also found that suspected patients often had 2~3 repeated tests of nasopharyngeal swabs before the positive result confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The sampling time lag and the inefficient diagnostic method may contribute to this lower positive rate of SARS-CoV-2. de Wit and colleagues 20 demonstrated that, in the rhesus macaque model, MERS-CoV RNA could detect in the conjunctiva, and the viral loads could no longer be detected in the conjunctiva 6 days post infection. However, the mean time for conjunctival sampling are 18.15 days in our present study. Another thing needs to be considered is that the lower positive rate of RT-PCR makes early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 a challenge. Therefore, improvements in the sensitivity of molecular diagnostic methods need to be taking in the future.",
