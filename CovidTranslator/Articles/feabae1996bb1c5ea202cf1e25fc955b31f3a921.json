After reinfection and after reactivation, no BHVlspecific IgM antibody response was detected. The serum IgA response was only transiently detectable after reinfection and again appeared rapidly after reactivation in most calves. Most calves showed an increase in nasal and ocular IgA titres after reinfection and reactivation; some calves also had IgA antibodies in genital secretions. A salient finding was that after reinfection and reactivation more calves showed a serum IgA response than virus shedding or an increase in serum IgGl or IgG2 titres.",

Because the immunity induced by a primary BHVl infection is relatively shortlasting, cattle may be reinfected with BHVl. Cattle infected with BHVl are lifelong carriers of the virus in a latent, non-infectious form, mainly in the trigeminal ganglia. As a result of stress, simulated by the administration of corticosteroids, BHVI can be reactivated and again be shed into the environment. Because the isotype-specific antibody responses after reinfection with and reactivation of BHVl have only been fragmentarily studied (Rodak et al., 1983; Guy and Potgieter, 1985a,b; Osorio et al., 1989; Edwards et al., 1991) , we extensively investigated these responses. In this report we describe their kinetics in sera, nasal, ocular and genital secretions of experimentally reinfected and corticosteroid treated calves. The isotype-specific antibody responses after primary infection have been recently reported (Madic et al., 1995) .",

In the present experiment the remaining 30 calves were all (re)inoculated by intranasal spray, 4 ml into each nostril, containing a total of lo7 TCID,, of the virulent Iowa strain of BHVl (kindly provided by Dr. J.M.

After intranasal re-exposure with BHV 1, Guy and Potgieter ( 1985a) observed a slight increase in IgM antibody titre, whereas after intra-amniotic inoculation a rapid increase was detected after abortion. In addition, they detected a secondary IgM antibody response after reactivation (Guy and Potgieter, 1985b) . These discrepancies may be explained by the difference in IgM detection method or by differences in experimental design, including breed of cattle, strain and dose of virus, route and duration of corticosteroid treatment. Osorio et al. ( 1989) could not detect an IgM antibody response after BHVl reactivation either. After reactivation of herpes simplex virus, an IgM antibody response is seldom observed and then associated with severe encephalitis (Kalimo et al., 1977; Van Loon et al., 1981) ; however, reactivation of herpes zoster virus often leads to an IgM response (Tedder et al., 198 1) . After reinfection of calves with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) IgM was not detected in sera, but was detected in nasal and ocular secretions (Kimman et al., 1987) . However, the pathogenesis of a BRSV infection is different from that of a BHVl infection: the latter giving rise to clinical signs of the upper respiratory tract, whereas a BRSV infection mainly affects the lower respiratory tract.",

The serum IgA response in reinfected or reactivated calves was much earlier detectable than that in primary infected calves, indicating a memory response. Rodak et al. (1983) and Edwards et al. ( 199 1) could not detect any serum IgA response in BHV 1 -reinfected calves. Eleven calves in which no virus excretion could be detected after reinfection and/or reactivation even showed a clear systemic IgA antibody response. An explanation for this unexpected tinding may be that in latently infected calves that are given corticosteroids non-infectious physical rather than infectious BHVl particles may be produced (Pastoret et al., 1979) . These physical particles stimulate an antibody response. However, the discrepancy between virus excretion and antibody response may be due to our failure to detect infectious virus particles, because these were not excreted via nasal or ocular secretions or because only one nasal or ocular swab was taken per 24 h. However, it may be the serum IgA response seems to be a much more sensitive indicator for reinfection with or reactivation of BHVl than detection of nasal and ocular virus shedding. In the case of BRSV infection the secondary serum IgA response was not transient, but persisted for more than 3.5 months (Kimman et al., 1987) .",

The mucosal IgA response after reinfection was more rapid and stronger than in the primary infected calves (Figs. 2 and 3) , indicating the existence of mucosal memory and thus confirms earlier reports on BRSV and bovine corona virus infections (Kimman et al., 1987; Heckert et al., 1991) . After the primary infection (Madic et al., 1995) , IgA antibodies were not detected in genital secretions, whereas, probably as a result of priming, after reinfection and reactivation genital IgA antibodies were found in 12 of 30 calves.",

This is further substantiated by the finding that no correlation existed between nasal IgA titres at reinfection and onset of corticosteroid treatment on the one hand, and virus shedding periods on the other.",

Guy and Potgieter ( 1985a) also found that the antibody increase after reinfection was more frequent in the IgG2 than in the IgGl isotype. After corticosteroid treatment, virus-positive nasal secretions were detected in 20 of 26 reinfected calves, and a significant increase in serum IgGl and IgG2 antibody titre in 17 and 12 calves, respectively. There was no correspondence between virus shedding and antibody titre increases (Table 1 ). The inability of some calves to elicit a booster IgGl or IgG2 serum antibody response may partially be due to the high antibody titres that already existed after reinfection and corticosteroid treatment. In any case, more calves reacted with a systemic IgA response after reinfection and corticosteroid treatment than with a systemic IgGl or IgG2 response. This further supports the systemic IgA response to be a sensitive indicator of BHVl reinfection and reactivation.",

IgG2 antibodies were only detected in nasal secretions in fewer calves than IgGl antibodies. Most of the IgG containing secretions were free of erythrocytes, excluding leakage of blood as a cause of the IgG 1 and IgG2 presence. Whether transudation or selective transport from serum or mucosal production is responsible for the mucosal IgG cannot be conclusively determined, but the IgGl /IgG2 antibody ratio in serum usually did not correspond with that in nasal secretion (data not shown). This indicates selective transport of IgGl and IgG2 rather than transudation from serum. The IgG2 isotype was never detected in ocular secretions after primary infection (Madic et al., 1995) , after reinfection and after reactivation, suggesting that this isotype may not or rarely pass the conjunctival mucosae. This finding is also in favour of selective transport of IgGl through ocular mucous membranes. IgGl and IgG2 antibodies against BHV 1 were detected in genital secretions in a few calves, only after corticosteroid treatment.",
