The more distantly related roniviruses also group with corona-and toroviruses, thus forming a kind of supercluster of nidoviruses with large genomes. By contrast, arteriviruses must have diverged earlier during nidovirus evolution. The current taxonomic position of coronaviruses and toroviruses as two genera of the family Coronaviridae is currently being revised by elevating these virus groups to the taxonomic rank of either subfamily or family.",

It is currently being debated whether some of these viruses (e.g., BtCoV-HKU5, BtCoV-133 (isolated in 2005) , and BtCoV-HKU9) may in fact represent novel subgroups or groups.

In arteriviruses, four comparably distant genetic clusters have been differentiated. Roniviruses are the only members of the order Nidovirales that are known to infect invertebrates.

Whereas S proteins can differ in size, they share an exposed globular head domain and, with the exception of roniviruses, a stem portion containing heptad repeats organized in a coiled-coil structure. The S proteins of corona-and toroviruses (and most likely those of bafiniviruses) form trimers that bind the cell surface receptor whereas receptor binding in roniviruses is probably mediated by gp116 (S1). The arterivirus envelope proteins form two higherorder complexes: one is a disulfide-linked heterodimer of GP 5 and the M protein; and the other is a heterotrimer of the minor structural glycoproteins GP 2 , GP 3 , and GP 4 . Except for the E and M proteins, all arterivirus structural proteins are glycosylated. By contrast, the M proteins of corona-and toroviruses (and, most likely, bafiniviruses) are glycosylated, and they share a triple-spanning membrane topology with the amino-terminus exposed on the outside of the virions and the carboxy-terminus facing the nucleocapsid.

Nidovirus genome expression is controlled at the translational and post-translational levels. Thus, for example, ribosomal frameshifting is required for the expression of ORF1b, and the two replicase polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab) are proteolytically processed by viral proteases. The proteolytic processing occurs in a coordinated manner and gives rise to the functional subunits of the viral replication-transcription complex. By contrast, the expression of the structural and several accessory proteins is controlled at the level of transcription. It involves the synthesis of a nested set of 3 0 co-terminal sg mRNAs that are produced in nonequimolar amounts.

In corona-, toro-, bafini-, and roniviruses, ORF1a encodes a polyprotein (pp1a) of 450-520 kDa, whereas a polyprotein of 760-800 kDa (pp1ab) is synthesized from ORF1ab. Expression of the ORF1b-encoded part of pp1ab involves a ribosomal frameshift mechanism that, in a defined proportion of translation events, directs a controlled shift into the \u00c01 reading frame just upstream of the ORF1a stop codon ( Figure 4 ). In arteriviruses, pp1a (190-260 kDa) and pp1ab (345-420 kDa) are considerably smaller in size. Proteolytic processing of coronavirus pp1a and pp1ab generates up to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps 1-16), while processing of the arterivirus replicase polyproteins generates up to 14 nsps. It is generally accepted that most of the replicase nsps assemble into a large protein complex, called the replication-transcription complex. The complex is anchored to intracellular membranes and likely also includes a number of cellular proteins. Nidoviruses replicase genes include a conserved array of protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase (HEL), and endoribonuclease (NendoU) activities.

Also the term 'main protease' (M pro ) is increasingly used for this enzyme, mainly to refer to its key role in nidovirus replicase polyprotein processing ( Figure 5 ). Nidovirus-M pro share a three-domain structure. The two N-terminal domains adopt a two-b-barrel fold reminiscent of the structure of chymotrypsin. With respect to the principal catalytic residues, there are major differences between the main proteases from different nidovirus genera. The presence of a third, C-terminal domain is a conserved feature of nidovirus main proteases, even though these domains vary significantly in both size and structure. The C-terminal domain of the coronavirus M pro is involved in protein dimerization that is required for proteolytic activity in trans. Over the past years, a large body of structural and functional information has been obtained for corona-and arterivirus main proteases which, in the case of coronaviruses, has also been used to develop selective protease inhibitors that block viral replication, suggesting that nidovirus main proteases may be attractive targets for antiviral drug design.",

The functional relevance of hnRNP A1 in coronavirus replication was supported by experiments showing that its overexpression promotes MHV replication, whereas replication was reduced in cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant of hnRNP A1.

Other cellular proteins found to bind to coronavirus genomic RNA, such as aconitase and the heat shock proteins HS40 and HS70, might be involved in modulating coronavirus replication.

The resulting chimeric sg RNAs of negative polarity are transcribed to yield sg mRNAs that share both 5 0 -and 3 0 -terminal sequences with the genome RNA. Genes expressed through sg mRNAs are preceded by conserved 'transcriptionregulatory sequences' (TRSs) that presumably act as attenuation or termination signals during the production of the subgenome-length negative-strand RNAs. In arteriviruses and coronaviruses, the TRSs preceding each ORF are presumed to direct attenuation of negative-strand RNA synthesis, leading to the 'jumping' of the nascent negative-strand RNA to the leader TRS (TRS-L). This process is guided by a base-pairing interaction between complementary sequences (leader TRS and body TRS complement) and it has been proposed that template switching only occurs if the free energy (DG) for the formation of this duplex reaches a minimum threshold. This process is named 'discontinuous extension of minus strands' and can be considered a variant of similarity-assisted template-switching that operates during viral RNA recombination.

Using this natural assumption, a speculative scenario of major events in nidovirus evolution has been proposed. It has been speculated that the most recent common ancestor of the Nidovirales had a genome size close to that of the current arteriviruses. This ancestor may have evolved from a smaller RNA virus by acquiring the two nidovirus genetic marker domains represented by the helicaseassociated zinc-binding domain (ZBD) and the NendoU function. These two domains may have been used to improve the low fidelity of RdRp-mediated RNA replication, thus generating viruses capable of efficiently replicating genomes of about 14 kbp. The subsequent evolution of much larger nidovirus genomes may have been accompanied by the acquisition of the ExoN domain. This domain may have further improved the fidelity of RNA replication through its 3 0 -5 0 exonuclease activity, which might operate in proofreading mechanisms similar to those employed by DNA-based life forms. It has been suggested that the ORF1b-encoded HEL, ExoN, NendoU, and O-MT domains may provide RNA specificity, whereas the relatively abundantly expressed CPD and ADRP might control the pace of a common pathway that could be part of a hypothetical oligonucleotide-directed repair mechanism used in the present coronaviruses and roniviruses.

These findings are consistent with clinical observations of a relatively normal endoscopic and microscopic appearance of the intestine in SARS patients.

N-proximal polyprotein regions are cleaved at two or three sites by viral papain-like proteases 1 (PL1) and 2 (PL2), whereas the central and C-terminal polyprotein regions are processed by the main protease, M pro . PL1 domains are indicated by orange boxes and cognate cleavage sites are indicated by orange arrowheads. PL2 domains and PL2-mediated cleavages are shown in green and CL domains and CL-mediated cleavages are shown in red. Note that EAV encodes a second, but proteolytically inactive PL1 domain (PL1*; orange-striped box). For the genera Torovirus, Bafinivirus, and Okavirus, the available information on pp1ab proteolytic processing is limited and not shown here.
