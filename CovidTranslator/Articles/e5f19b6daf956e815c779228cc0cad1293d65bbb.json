Thirty-two studies involving 3770 patients (COVID-19 = 1062, MERS-COV = 2708) were included in this study. The present study revealed that compared with COVID-19 population, MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality and longer incubation time. It pointed out that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication. The most effective drug for MERS-COV is ribavirin and interferon.",

The four other human coronaviruses In addition, we found that the number of males is more than that of females in either COVID-19 or MERS-COV population. The possible reason of reduced susceptibility of females to viral infection is that females have a lot of X chromosome and estrogen that are vital components in development of innate and adaptive immunity [47] . Meanwhile, numbers of patients with COVID-19 infection had chronic comorbidities, mainly hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease, which is similar to MERS-COV population. Those results indicate that older adult males with chronic underlying disease might be more susceptibility to COVID-19 or MERS-COV.",

This result indicates that COVID-19 might be associated with cellular immune response, mainly act on lymphocytes like MERS-COV does [48] . The cells infected by viruses induce the release of numbers of pro-inflammatory cytokines and inflammation storm in the body. Moreover, increased cytokines might make damage to related organs such as liver [49] . Our results demonstrated that abnormal value of AST was found in MERS-COV population, but not in COVID-19 population. The possible reason is that the follow-up time of COVID-19 population was too short, and the liver might remain to be in compensatory stage. For this result, a long follow-up time study is urgently needed. On the other hand, our results suggested that MERS-COV population had a higher rate of ICU admission and fatality than COVID-19 population, indicating that compared with MERS-COV, COVID-19 has less toxic and more easily cured. However, lower discharge rate was found in COVID population than in MERS-COV population. The possible explanation is that most of COVID-19 patients remained to be hospitalized at the time of manuscript submission, and data on those patients could not be obtained in time.

Before 2019, there is a total of six identified coronaviruses, but that might only be a small part of the iceberg, with potentially more novel and terrible zoonoses to be presented. As December 8, 2019, a series of unexplained pneumonia cases linked to Huanan seafood wholesale market has been reported in Wuhan, Hubei, China [5-6]. Clinical characteristics of this pneumonia were very similar to those of viral pneumonia such as MERS-COV, initially severe acute respiratory infection, followed by developing rapidly acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and even acute respiratory failure [7]. Sequencing data from throat swab samples of a patient indicated a novel coronavirus subsequently named corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by world health organization (WHO). So far, more than 70000 confirmed cumulative cases have been reported in China, and more than 10000 confirmed cumulative cases in other countries such as South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran and the USA.",

The newest one is COVID-19. The sequencing analysis has indicated that COVID-19, like SARS-COV and MERS-COV, belongsto \u03b2 -coronavirus. Both SARS-COV and MERS-COV originated in bats, but the origin of COVID-19 remains to be further investigated. Although recent studies have reported the clinical and laboratory features of COVID-19, systematic comparsion between COVID-19 -COV has yet been performed. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform the first systematic review to compare epidemiological, clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 and MERS-COV populations. Our results suggested that fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia were main clinical manifestations of both COVID-19 and MERS-COV, whereas ARDS was main complication. Compared with MERS-COV population, COVID-19 population had a less incubation time and lower rate of ICU admission, discharge and fatality. Similarities of clinical characteristics between COVID-19 and MERS-COV have been found. In the current study, the majority of COVID-19 patients presented with fever, cough and generalised weakness and myalgia, which shows some resemblances to MERS-COV infection. Moreover, both COVID-19 and MERS-COV patients hardly developed upper respiratory tract infection such as rhinorrhoea or pharyngalgia, indicating that their target cells might be located in lower respiratory. However, 11.6% of patients with COVID-19 infection had diarrhoea or anorexia, and only 4.7% of patients with MERS-COV infection had this symptom. Thus, Faces and urine samples should be tested to exclude a potential alternative way of transmission that is unknown to the present.",
