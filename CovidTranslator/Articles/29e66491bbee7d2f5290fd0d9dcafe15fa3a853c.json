            "text": "n May 2006, the Canadian College of Health Service Executives issued a position paper entitled The Role of Health Care Leaders in Planning for an Influenza Pandemic. 1 It was a well-researched overview of leadership accountabilities current at that time. However, although there has been considerable work throughout Canada and around the world to prepare for a pandemic, much has also changed over the intervening period regarding expectations. The complexities of preparing for a pandemic are immense. We have spent the last three years discussing pandemic planning at conferences and in the College's Health Professional Roundtable for Strategy (HRPS) sessions. Are we ready? This question is extremely timely for all health leaders as we react to the most recent scare with the severe respiratory illness outbreak, H1N1, which originated in Mexico. So let us catch up to where we are today.",

            "text": "As shown in Table 1 , the World Health Organization has a six-level pandemic alert scale. 2 In reaction to the outbreak of H1N1, which began April 17, 2009, the WHO on April 28 raised the alert status to Level 4, meaning there was evidence of increased human-to-human transmission. On April 29, the alert status was raised to Level 5, indicating evidence of significant human-to-human transmission. As leaders, we are now the closest ever in our careers to a pandemic. But will the pandemic actually happen? If we learn from history and study pandemics over the last 300 years, it is evident that they regularly occur. Since 1700, no more than 42 years have passed without a pandemic event. It has been 41 years since the last pandemic so the risk of another is high enough to warrant urgent readiness. Global travel patterns make the risk of a pandemic homogeneous around the world so that all countries are equally vulnerable to a pandemic that originates in one country. 3 There were several lessons learned from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis in 2003 that have significantly improved our planning for a pandemic event. However, there are distinct differences between SARS and an influenza pandemic that are important to recognize. 4 I Will we be judged ready for the influenza pandemic?",

Since development of a specific vaccine for the pandemic influenza virus will take several months, governments have made the decision to stockpile antivirals as a strategy for reducing morbidity and mortality and ensuring service continuity of the health care sector. The differences between countries are not centred on the stockpiling decision but rather the size of the stockpile to support the population. Canada has purchased sufficient antivirals to support 17.5% of its population. Figure  2 shows by country the size of the antiviral stockpile relative to population covered. Some countries such as the United Kingdom and France have stockpiles for at least 50% of the population and all comparator G7 countries' stockpile levels are greater than Canada's. Why the difference in stockpile levels since the objective of all countries is surely the same? 13 The Task Group on Antivirals for Prophylaxis (TGAP), under the auspices of the Pan-Canadian Public Health Network Council, released its report to the Canadian government in August 2008, with the following recommendations on the use of antivirals during an influenza pandemic: 14 \u2022 Post-exposure prophylaxis of close contacts should be offered in Canada during the WHO pandemic alert period Phases 4 and 5; \u2022 During implementation of the early treatment strategy, critical infrastructure-sector workers will have access to rapid assessment and early treatment; \u2022 Use of antivirals for outbreak control, in closed health care facilities and other closed facilities where high-risk people reside during WHO pandemic alert period Phase 6; and \u2022 Antivirals for pre-exposure prophylaxis not to be stockpiled for any of the pandemic phases.",

Proposed outbreak control measures during the pandemic will result in patients and health care workers in 'closed' facilities being treated differently than those in acute care hospitals, even though the risk may be the same. 3.
