Although public health authorities are racing to contain the spread of COVID-19 around the world, the situation is still grim. About 158 111 confirmed cases and 5946 cumulative deaths (81 059 confirmed cases and 3204 cumulative deaths from China) have been reported around the globe as of March 15, 2020. Some clinical cases have found that some carriers of the virus may be asymptomatic, with no fever, and no, or only slight symptoms of infection. Without the ability to screen these asymptomatic patients quickly and effectively, these unsuspecting carriers have the potential to increase the risk of disease transmission if no early effective quarantine measures are implemented. Therefore, to trace unknown COVID-19 sources, fast and accurate screening of potential virus carriers and diagnosis of asymptomatic patients is a crucial step for intervention and prevention at the early stage.",

Such a massive undertaking is time-consuming and labor intensive and is constrained by the availability of testing technologies at this extremely critical time. However, an alternative method utilizing wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE), may provide an effective approach to predict the potential spread of the infection by testing for infectious agents in wastewater, which has been approved as an effective way to trace illicit drugs, and obtain information on health, disease, and pathogens. 1 Faeces and urine from disease carriers in the community will contain many biomarkers that can enter the sewer system. A recent study demonstrated that live SARS-CoV-2 was isolated from the faeces and urine of infected people, 2 which would then enter the wastewater treatment system. A further study has shown that SARS-CoV-2 can typically survive for up to several days in an appropriate environment after exiting the human body. There is potential, therefore, that the analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in community wastewater could trace COVID-19 sources through sewage pipe networks and determine whether there are potential SARS-CoV-2 carriers in certain local areas. If SARS-CoV-2 can be monitored in the community at the early stage through WBE, effective intervention can be taken as early as possible to restrict the movements of that local population, working to minimize the pathogen spread and threat to public health.",

Currently, the most direct method for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 is a nucleic acid\u2212based polymerase chain reaction(PCR) assay, which is also a means for confirmation of COVID-19 patients throughout China. Although PCR has high sensitivity and specificity, requirements for complicated sample handling in the laboratory, skilled personnel, and a long period of data processing and analysis (4\u22126 h) are not conducive to real-time and effective monitoring of samples on location. Therefore, it is critical to develop efficient transportable and robust analytical tools to accurately and quickly trace low-level SARS-CoV-2 sources through WBE to confirm these suspected cases and screen asymptomatic infected cases without centralized laboratories.",

The whole testing process can be completed through simple folding of a paper-based device in different ways in different steps without a pump or power supply, which overcomes the limitation of PCR and avoids multiple processes. Paper analytical devices enable multiplexed, sensitive assays that rival PCR laboratory assays and provide high-quality, fast precision diagnostics for pathogens. For example, a recent work has demonstrated that the multiplexed determination of malaria from whole blood using a paperbased device in rural Uganda. 4 The test could sensitively analyze multiplexed nucleic acid sequences of pathogens within 50 min, which gave a higher-quality and faster precision diagnosis for malaria than PCR.",

The potentially infected patient will also benefit from paper analytical device tracing SARS-CoV-2 sources with WBE, providing information for the correct and timely treatment of COVID-19. ",
