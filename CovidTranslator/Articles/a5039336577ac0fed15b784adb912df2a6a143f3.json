Conclusion: The clinical characteristics of the novel coronavirus pneumonia in Kunming are different from those in Wuhan. The changes of serum proalbumin and T cell subsets are relatively obvious. Changes in serum proalbumin may contribute to the early warning of novel coronavirus pneumonia. The nutritional status of patients with common and mild pneumonia should be considered.",

As a commonly used indicator to evaluate nutritional status in clinical practice, prealbumin is often utilized to evaluate tumor and postoperative recovery [4] . Domestic scholar CAI Chuanqi et al. [5] found that hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for the severity of disease in elderly pneumonia patients. This study found that the albumin in the disease group was basically normal, while the prealbumin was significantly lower than that in the normal control group. We analyzed the relationship between prealbumin and CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells respectively. The regression model showed that there is a linear and positive correlation between the level of prealbumin in the serum of patients and CD3 + T cells, CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells, with the strongest correlation among CD8 + T cells. Proalbumin is an acute reactive protein synthesized by liver cells with a half-life of 19 days [6] . In the early stage of the disease, proalbumin changes, which may be caused by the consumption of proalbumin by the body after infection with the virus, leading to the reduction of proalbumin in peripheral blood. Recent studies have found that inflammation is an effective inhibitor of protein synthesis, and it may also inhibit the synthesis of visceral prealbumin during the occurrence and development of the disease, leading to a low level of prealbumin [7] . Due to fever and infection, the body is in a state of high decomposition and high energy demand. If at the same time with lack of energy and loss of appetite, the patient cannot ensure sufficient food intake through the mouth to meet the needs of the body. Meanwhile if combined with basic diseases of other viscera, moderate or severe malnutrition can easily appear in pneumonia patients. Clinical studies have found that malnutrition rates in patients with severe pneumonia are as high as 60%, with immune dysfunction. Enteral nutrition or other forms of nutritional support are usually provided only to patients with severe pneumonia. Good nutritional status not .

Prealbumin can be used as an early warning indicator of immune function in patients with new coronavirus pneumonia. Through the analysis of the relationship between prealbumin and T cell subsets, the decreased value of prealbumin indicates that the patient's cellular immune function is impaired, which plays a certain role in clinical condition monitoring.",
