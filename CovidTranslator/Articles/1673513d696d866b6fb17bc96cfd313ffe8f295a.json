The ability of this sampler to collect infectious airborne viruses from a calm-air chamber loaded with influenza A virus was tested. The sampler's efficiency at collecting aerosolized viral particles from a calm-air chamber is essentially the same as that from the high performance SKC BioSampler that collects un-fractionated particles directly into a liquid media (2.4 \u00d7 10 4 total viral particles per liter of sampled air (TVP/L) versus 2.6 \u00d7 10 4 TVP/L, respectively, after 15 min) and the efficiency is relatively constant over collection times of 15, 30 and 60 min. Approximately 34% of the aerosolized infectious virus collected after 15 min with the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler remained infectious, and infectious virus was found in all three size fractions. After 60 min of sampling, the infectious virus/liter air found in the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was 15% of that found in the SKC BioSampler. This preservation of infectivity by the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was maintained even when the initial infectivity prior to aerosolization was as low as 0.06%. The utility of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler was further extended by incorporating an enhanced infectivity detection methodology developed in our laboratory, the viral replication assay, which amplified the infectious virus making it more readily detectable.",

However, research addressing the efficacy of current samplers to detect infectious airborne viruses is sparse and points to the need for a more efficient sampler. 1 A two-stage cyclone bioaerosol sampler has been developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). 2 The NIOSH bioaerosol sampler is unique in that it size-fractionates aerosols and collects them in disposable centrifuge tubes, facilitating direct sample processing. As ambient air is drawn into an inlet at 3.5 L min \u22121 , the first stage of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler deposits aerosol particles that are >4 \u00b5m on the wall of a 15 ml centrifuge tube. In the second stage, 1 to 4 \u00b5m particles are deposited on the wall of a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, and particles that are <1 \u00b5m are collected on a 37 mm polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter. The first stage of the sampler collects the non-respirable size fraction, while the second stage and filter collect the respirable fraction. 3 The sampler is lightweight and can be used either as a stationary sampler (such as on a tripod in a hospital room), or as a personal breathing zone air sampler that can be worn on the clothing of workers in occupational environments.",

In later studies, improved NIOSH bioaerosol samplers (enlargements of the inlet and outlet ports, the addition of a 15 ml collection tube, and enlargement of the second stage outlet to reduce particle loss due to turbulence) were used as personal and stationary samplers in a hospital emergency department and an urgent care clinic during the influenza season. Analysis of the collected air samples showed that airborne influenza virus RNA could be found in both facilities and that 42-53% of the detectable viral RNA was found in the respirable fraction of the aerosol. 5, 6 Collectively, these studies support the potential for airborne transmission of influenza. However, the infectivity of the captured viral aerosols was not addressed.",

The APS drew air at 5 L min \u22121 through a vertical probe at the same height as the sampler inlets. From three to five NIOSH bioaerosol samplers were positioned inside the calm-air chamber on the bottom plate.

The flow rates through the NIOSH bioaerosol samplers were set before each experiment. The BioSamplers were outside the chamber, and drew aerosol samples through a vertical probe in the center of the bottom plate of the chamber. Each BioSampler was connected to the sampling port for 15 min and then removed, and the next BioSampler was then attached to the port. A ball valve in the sampling port was closed while changing BioSamplers. The SKC BioSamplers were connected to a central vacuum line and operated at 12.5 L/min. At the start of each experiment, the Aeroneb nebulizer was operated for 10 min to stabilize the aerosol concentration in the chamber. During this time, the APS was in operation and a vacuum purge was used to draw the aerosol into the chamber, but the samplers were not on. After 10 min, the vacuum purge was turned off and the NIOSH bioaerosol samplers and SKC BioSampler were switched on. The nebulizer was continuously operated during each experiment to provide a constant loading of aerosols in the chamber at about 0.1 ml of fluid/ min. After the aerosol collection was completed, the nebulizer, the pumps and the vacuum line were turned off. The exterior of the samplers were wiped to remove the deposited particles. The NIOSH bioaerosol samplers were disassembled and the collected aerosol fractions in each tube and on the filter were suspended in 1 ml of supplemented HBSS.",

Recently, the efficiencies of four commercial air samplers were compared. 1 In that study, collection of total viral particles by the SKC Bio-Sampler (which collects particles directly into a liquid media) was superior to 37 mm cassette samplers containing either a Teflon filter (74% recovery) or a gelatin filter (63% recovery), and the CCI sampler that contains a polyurethane foam filter (32% recovery). Of the four samplers tested, the SKC BioSampler maintained essentially 100% of the viability of the collected virus, whereas recoveries of viable virus from samplers with a gelatin filter, Teflon filter, or polyurethane filter were only 10%, 7%, and 22%, respectively. In our study, the ability of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler to collect aerosolized particles containing influenza virus was essentially the same as that of the SKC BioSampler and was relatively constant over the collection times of 15, 30, and 60 min. The NIOSH bioaerosol sampler maintained an average of 26% of the virus infectivity compared to the SKC BioSampler. These results are higher than those reported 1 for three other samplers, although it should be noted that a direct comparison cannot be made since Fabian et al. 1 used a different viral strain, different aerosolization and collection media, and performed their experiments at 50 to 55% relative humidity versus 20% for our experiments. The amount of infectious virus recovered from the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler is significantly lower than seen with the SKC BioSampler and does show a clear decline after 60 min of collection, suggesting that the dry collected virus gradually loses infectivity due to desiccation or degradation. This indicates that collection times should be kept to a minimum, and that the potential advantages of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler need to be weighed against this drawback. Prolonged collection times with the SKC BioSampler result in significant loss of the collection media due to evaporation (26% loss of collection media in 15 min; data not shown) and thus should be avoided as well.",

Viral stocks with similarly low (0.3-0.5%) infectivity were used by Fabian et al. 1 Conceivably the viability is actually much higher as viability assessed by the chicken embryo infectious dose endpoint 50% (CEID 50 ) from the manufacturer (ATCC) is 10-50\u00d7 higher. This discrepancy may simply reflect a lack of sensitivity of the VPA for determining infectivity or the initial infectivity of the stock may have degraded with storage, and emphasizes the need to increase the sensitivity of the infectivity assessments for future studies. To address this, we have combined the use of the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler with our VRA methodology which greatly facilitated our ability to detect infectious virus even when the initial infectivity in the nebulizer was only 0.13-0.14%. Dilution of the viral suspension loaded into the nebulizer from 3.8 \u00d7 10 4 PFU/ml to 1.3 \u00d7 10 2 PFU/ml (283-fold dilution), resulted in no PFU recovered in the collected samples, however, matrix gene transcripts arising from infectious virus in the samples were detected by the VRA.",

We found that the addition of supplemented HBSS to the collection tubes did not improve infectivity (data not shown), probably because the virus is deposited at the top of the tube and above the media rather than into the media. Adding more media, however, would negatively alter the aerodynamics of collection. In another approach, the top portion of the Stage 1 collection tubes were coated with 2% agar or 0.1% mucin, or supplemented HBSS-soaked electrets filters were inserted near the top. However, neither infectivity nor the total amount of recovered viral particles were increased over that found when uncoated tubes were used (data not shown).",

Coughing, sneezing and talking generate airborne particles ranging in size from a few millimetres to <1 \u00b5m. Knowing whether infectious influenza is present in the respirable fraction would help provide a better assessment for risk of infection. Such information would dictate the personal protective equipment and guidelines for preventing personal exposure such as the type of particle mask or respirator to use, enable appropriate adjustments to air handling systems, and determine which personal protective measures need to be taken while conducting potentially aerosol-generating medical procedures during influenza outbreaks. Although the SKC BioSampler is significantly better at preserving viral infectivity and has a higher sample flow rate, the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler can be used with personal sampling pumps and worn as a personal sampler. Because it does not require aqueous buffers for collection of airborne virus, the collection time for the NIOSH bioaerosol sampler is not limited by water evaporation from the media, and the sampler is not sensitive to bouncing or tilting.",
