            "text": "microRNAs (miRNAs) represent a newly identified class of nonprotein-coding *22 nt small RNA that plays important roles in multiple biological processes by degrading targeted mRNA or repressing mRNA translation. This study observed the morphology of swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages (including 1-day old, 1-7 month old) by Hematoxylin-eosin staining. We also examined the expression of miR-499 and its target genes (CYLC1, DMRT1, QKI, XRN2, ZNF313) in samples of tissue slices using quantitative reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction, which showed that miR-499 had a significant negative correlation with QKI gene. Then, the proteins of QKI gene expression were determined by western blot, which were consistent with results of quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) detection. Therefore, the luciferase reporter gene system was used to verify correlation between miR-499 and QKI gene. Activity of luciferase was significantly lower in miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-WT group than the miR-499 co-transfected with pmiR-RB-REPORT-QKI-mut/si groups, indicating that target sequence of miR-499 existed in 3\u00a2UTR of QKI gene. Furthermore, the expressions of miR-499 and QKI were detected in testicular cells that were transfected with miR-499, miR-499 negative control and untreated. The results showed that the diameter of convoluted seminiferous tubule growth increased with age. Significantly different expressions of miR-499 and its target genes were found in swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages ( p < 0.05), overexpressing miR-499 analysis, suggesting that miR-499 was negatively correlated to the expression of QKI ( p < 0.05). In conclusion, QKI is a target gene of miR-499.",

            "text": "M iRNAs are classes of small, endogenous, noncoding regulatory RNAs that are *22 nucleotides in length (Ma et al., 2012) . They are widely expressed in eukaryotes and participate in the regulation of a variety of functions, including gene expression, developmental timing, organ development, cells proliferation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, fat metabolism, nervous system, and the biological processes of tumors (Cai et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2004; Smalheiser and Torvik, 2005) . Increasing studies have shown that miRNAs are essential for normal spermatogenesis and male fertility. For example, the lack of synthetic miRNA required by Dicerdeficient mice produces an abnormal elongation in their sperm, which results in male sterility (Brueckner et al., 2007; He et al., 2007; Lujambio et al., 2008) . But research of miRNAs in swine testis is seldom. miR-499 is an important aspect of miRNAs, the major function of which is an important regulatory role in the occurrence and development of a variety of cancers (Chu et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Brunotto et al., 2014) . Recent studies suggest that a significant association exists between miR-NA499 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and hepato-cellular carcinoma (Chu and Hsieh, 2014) . The overexpression of miRNA499 alone increased the number of beating cells, suggesting that miR-499 may act as a factor promoting cell proliferation (Pisano et al., 2014) . Significant difference expression of miR-499 in immature and mature Junmu no.1 white swine testicular tissue was found by high-throughput sequencing (Lian et al., 2012) . This result suggests that expression of miR-499 maybe chronological in swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages. miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression by complete or incomplete complementary target genes. But a few reports have investigated the target genes of miR-499. Therefore, we aimed at evaluating the expressions of miR-499 and its target genes in swine testicular tissue at different developmental stages, and we sought to provide further verification on the relationship between miR-499 and QKI gene.",
