            "text": "A nephropathogenic K2/01 strain of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was attenuated by 170 serial passages in embryonated chicken eggs for possible use as a future IBV vaccine strain. High-growth properties and narrow tissue tropisms (limited replication in respiratory tracts) were achieved by the adaptation process. Unlike the parent strain, the attenuated strain (K2p170) was safe in day-old specific-pathogen-free chicks since replication of the virus did not induce mortality and nephritis, and rarely induced histological changes in the trachea and kidney after intraocular administration. In day-old broilers, even though coarse spray administration of K2p170 induced clinical signs, ciliostasis, and histopathological lesions in the trachea and the kidney, they were all comparable to birds vaccinated with commercial H120 vaccine. Despite restriction of viral replication in the respiratory tract, K2p170 elicited the production of antiserum with a neutralization index of 4.5. K2p170 provided almost complete protection against both two distinct subgroups of Korean nephropathogenic strain (KM91-like and QX-like subgroup). Furthermore, K2p170 provided significantly greater cross-protection against two heterologous strains (Massachusetts and Korean respiratory strain) than those conferred by the commercial H120 vaccine. K2p170 also had no virulence reversion after five back passages in chickens. In conclusion, K2p170 exhibits a fine balance between attenuation and immunogenicity, possesses cross-protective efficacy, and merits further investigation as a potential live vaccine as an alternative means of protection against the recently emergent nephropathogenic IBV infection in many Eurasian countries.",

IB causes severe economic losses to the poultry industry because it causes poor weight gain and feed efficiency in broilers and suboptimal egg production and egg quality in laying birds. In addition, high mortality (<30%) sometimes occurs in young chickens due to kidney manifestations of some nephropathogenic strains. The disease process is often complicated by secondary bacterial infections that cause increased mortality of birds and condemnation at processing [1, 2] .",

Crossprotection tends to decrease as the degree of amino acid identity between the spike (S) glycoprotein S1 subunit of two IBV strains decreases [3] . However, some strains occasionally confer broad protection against many heterologous serotypes. The concept of protectotypes [4] has been suggested as a valuable method that should be considered during the development of strategies to control IBV infections, and strains possessing cross-protective ability are generally considered to be useful vaccine candidates. To date, the Massachusetts (Mass) and 4/91 strains have been primarily used as live vaccines due to their epizootic distributions and crossprotective ability [2, 5] .",

In fact, long-term passage in embryonated eggs is necessary to reduce the virulence of IBV, and most commercially available IBV vaccines (e.g., H52, H120, 4/91 and GA98) are produced by more than 50 serial passages [5, 21] . In a previous study, the 120th passage virus of the Mass serotype (the H120 strain) did not induce any mortality in day-old chicks [5] . However, in this study, 120th passage virus of the K2parent did not induce mortality in day-old chicks by intraocular administration, but still induced mortality (<30%) in day-old chicks after coarse spray administration (data not shown). Therefore, we found that nephropathogenic strains required additional egg passages when compared to Mass strains for complete attenuation. On the other hand, the 170th passage virus (K2p170) was considered to be completely attenuated because it was nonpathogenic to day-old chicks. To our knowledge, the K2p170 seems to be the most highly egg passaged strain commercial IBV vaccine strains in the world [5] .",

In agreement with previous studies conducted to determine a region that leads to the pathogenic phenotype of IBV [15, 27] , our findings suggest that the renal tropism and pathogenicity of K2p170 are not related to the S1 gene, but to other genes [28] .

These findings indicate that K2p170 is highly immunogenic. As seen in a previous study describing the genetic stability of Korean nephropathogenic strains sharing 96% homology of the S1 gene for 10 years [15] , we observed only eight amino acid changes in the S1 protein of K2p170. Interestingly, most altered residues were located outside of the hypervariable region (HVR), which is associated with the neutralizing epitope [1] . Because the S1 protein has been identified as a major inducer of protective immune responses, our findings lead to the conclusion that the genetic stability of K2p170 contributes to maintenance of constant immunogenicity, even after prolonged passage in embryonated eggs. Although K2parent was chosen based on its cross-protective ability [8] , it is not clear if the fully attenuated K2p170 still induced cross-protection. In efficacy studies, K2p170 provided almost complete protection against distinct QX-like subgroup strain of Korean group II (K1277/03) and significant protection against heterologous IBV strains belonged to Mass group (Mass41) and Korean group I (K107/04). It has been proposed that the use of a combination of two commercial vaccines, Mass and 4/91, could be partly effective against heterologous IBV strains, including QX-like strains [32] . However, the use of multiple strains of live vaccines should be practiced with caution due to concerns regarding the formation of variant viruses by recombination with field strains resulting from the spread of vaccine strains [33] . Conversely, the results presented here suggest that single administration of the K2p170 is markedly effective and economical due to its cross-protective ability. It will be important to determine the range of cross-protection conferred by K2p170 against other heterologous IBV strains.",

Nevertheless, nephropathogenic strains appear to be the 3rd epizootic strain with Mass and 4/91 strains in many parts of the world. Based on the data presented in this study, K2p170 has broad-spectrum protective ability. Furthermore, the attenuation and immunogenicity of the virus were comparable to currently available commercial vaccines, which indicate that K2p170 is suitable for field application to young chicks in hatcheries and farms. Therefore, K2p170 merits consideration as a novel live vaccine candidate for the reduction of economic losses caused by newly evolving nephropathogenic IBV strains and the many IBV variants that have been reported worldwide.",
