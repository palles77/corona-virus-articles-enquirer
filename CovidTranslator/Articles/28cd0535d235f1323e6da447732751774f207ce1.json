The prevalence of HRV in published reports varies considerably. A novel HRV clade identifi ed in 2006, now known as HRV species C (HRV-C) (1), can be identifi ed only by PCR. Since 1988, seasonality and clinical outcomes and numerous different primer pairs have been used to identify HRV; how well these methods perform on new HRV types is uncertain. Given the likely variation in the preparation of RNA, the quality and formulations of commercial reverse transcription (RT)-PCR enzymes and reaction mix components and changes in thermal cyclers since 1988, not surprisingly many, perhaps most, of these assays are not being used in the manner they were originally described. For example, the fi rst HRV-specifi c primers reported (2) have subsequently been used with different RNA preparation methods, amounts of reverse transcriptase, cDNA priming strategies, dNTP concentrations, annealing temperatures (T M s), and cycling conditions (3, 4) .",

The study was approved by the Royal Children's Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee. The panel included representatives of the 3 HRV species (Figure) , human enteroviruses (HEVs), and extracts negative for picornaviruses. The HRVs had been previously detected by using a nested primer pair (online Appendix Table, www.cdc.gov/EID/content/17/2/294-appT.htm) (5). We used 10 different HRV primer pairs and also retested specimens by using the original primer pair with our standard reagents and equipment (5) . We applied the published T M when possible. The original descriptions of primer pairs 7 and 10 (online Appendix Table) lacked T M information, and after in-house calculations, we used T M s of 50\u00b0C and 58\u00b0C, respectively. We also deliberately standardized the reagents (OneStep RT-PCR kit, QIA-GEN, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia) and thermal cyclers used (Veriti, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for conventional PCR and the RotorGene 3000 real-time cycler (QIAGEN). Because primer pair 1 had a published history of detecting types from all HRV species, we chose it to genotype HRV-positive samples by sequencing the amplifi ed products. Other pairs were used if pair 1 was unsuccessful.",

Five primer pairs, including real-time PCR (rtPCR) pair 5, did not amplify the HEVs, a positive feature for HRV-specifi c studies. Only 2 primer pairs amplifi ed anything from a specimen that was positive for both HRV and HEV, a problem for accurate estimation of the frequency of co-detections. The original primer pair screen detected 3 untypeable picornaviruses, which were not detected by any other pair or by repeat testing using the same pair. Only the second-round amplicon of the 3 nested sets of nested primer pairs (2, 3, and 9) was considered because the second round increased the total number of positive specimens over the fi rst round.

As before, primer pair 1 detected the greatest num- Most notably, primer pair 7 performed better than it had in the previous population, detecting only 1 fewer HRV than primer pair 1 and 9 more HRVs than pair 8. No speciesspecifi c bias was apparent, but generally, a specimen with a lower RNA concentration, as indicated by the cycle threshold from primer pair 5, was less likely to be detected or typed by using other primer pairs. Primer pairs 5 and 8 did not detect the 3 HEVs (HEV-68). We noted in both populations that primer pair 1 sometimes amplifi ed a region of human genomic DNA from chromosome 6 (GQ497714), for which amplicon size was indistinguishable from that expected due to HRV. It was not possible to use the precise conditions reported for the 10 compared assays; 1 was published >2 decades ago and used phenol chloroform extraction. Some of the original enzyme formulations or reagents are no longer available, and production processes have changed in the interim. Thermal cyclers have also changed. There was no consensus on enzymes and reaction mixes used. In addi-tion, the previously published primers were used in assays divided between those using 1-step RT-PCR and those using a separate RT cDNA synthesis step. A review of studies that detected HRVs with adequately described conditions during 2009-2010 found that fewer used a single-tube RT-PCR approach than a 2-step system. We conducted singletube RT-PCR to maintain the benefi ts of the so-called closed amplifi cation system of rtPCR. Thus, we chose to use a single common set of reagents as the fairest way to compare the primer pairs examined in this study. We believe the nature of this relative comparison best refl ects performance for the likely end users: clinical microbiology laboratories or researchers.",

Most (29/33) specimens with <3 positive primer pairs were negative by rtPCR. Amplifi cation variability can also be attributed to the substantial nucleotide sequence diversity between HRVs and the different temporal and clinical characteristics of the 2 specimen populations we used. Population diversity is a feature of HRV studies in the literature.",
