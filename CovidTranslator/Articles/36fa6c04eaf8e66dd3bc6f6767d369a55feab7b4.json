In this study, we formulate a conceptual mathematical model on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 between the frontliners and the general public. We assume that the general public has a reproductive number between 1.5 to 4, and frontliners (e.g. healthcare workers, customer service and retail personnel, food service crews, and transport or delivery workers) have a higher reproduction number. Our simulations show that both the frontliners and the general public should be protected or resilient against the disease. Protecting only the frontliners will not result in flattening the epidemic curve. Protecting only the general public may flatten the epidemic curve but the infection risk faced by the frontliners is still high, which may eventually affect their work. Our simple model does not consider all factors involved in COVID-19 transmission in a community, but the insights from our model results remind us of the importance of community effort in controlling the transmission of the disease. All in all, the take-home message is that everyone in the community, whether a frontliner or not, should be protected or should implement preventive measures to avoid being infected.

Several control measures are being done to minimize the spread of this contagious disease such as social distancing, case isolation, household quarantine, and school and university closure [Ferguson, et. al 2020] . Following China's containment efforts, several countries adopted broad community quarantines or lockdowns as a means of controlling the spread of COVID-19 [Anderson, 2020 and Cohen and Kupferschmidt 2020] . However, amidst community quarantines and lockdowns, there are working classes who continue to provide essential services for healthcare, medicine, security, food, retail, and transport. This group of workers became collectively referred to as the \"frontliners\". The nature of their work being in close proximity and in frequent interaction with the public puts them at a higher risk of getting infected [Kiersz 2020 and Gamio 2020] , and once infected, their continuous contact with the public can make them superspreaders. This led to the implementation of more stringent precautionary measures for frontliners especially to those working in healthcare.",

It is estimated that the basic reproductive number of COVID-19 is around 1.5 to 4 [Rabajante 2020].

However, an infected public individual in isolation dies at a rate 1 while for the frontliner, the rate is given by 2 . Without isolation, the rate of recovery is 1 for an infected public individual and 2 for an infected frontliner. On the other hand, in isolation, a public individual recovers at a rate of 1 * and a frontliner recovers at a rate of 2 * . Individuals who recovered from the disease become susceptible again at a rate of 1 for the general public and 2 for the frontliners.",

When we increase the protection of the frontliners, we observe a decrease in the number of infected public individuals. We also found that decreasing the average secondary infections produced by an infectious public individual ( 01 ) will considerably reduce the infected population of both the general public and the frontliners (Fig.5a) . Figure 5b shows that the most effective way to minimize the number of infected individuals is a combination of reduced reproductive number ( 01 ) and an improved protection for the general public. Moreover, when the average number of secondary cases generated from a contagious public individual and a contagious frontliner is 1.5 and 2.5, respectively (i.e., 01 = 1.5 and 02 = 2.5), there is only a small chance that the general public will infect the frontliners (Fig. 5) , thus protecting the frontliners.
