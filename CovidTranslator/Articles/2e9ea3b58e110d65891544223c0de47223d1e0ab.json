Research on LSCs has significant implications for understanding how the airway epithelium develops and functions in health and disease and may provide the basis for future treatments. Stem cells can be defined as unspecialized cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into diverse tissue-or organ-specific cells. Stem cells are also essential for embryonic development and organogenesis. In addition, during normal tissue turnover or injury, stem cells are essential for the maintenance of homeostasis and repair of adult tissues. Stem cells normally are quiescent, proliferating infrequently, and can undergo asymmetric cell division. In response to injury, stem cells can proliferate rapidly and give rise to differentiated cells.",

Therefore, the ability to monitor the viability, distribution, and differentiation of the transplanted stem cells in vivo is a prerequisite for a better understanding of the role of stem cells play in the therapeutic process. For successful development of cell-based therapy, it is essential to facilitate and improve the number of stem cells engrafted in the target area and to monitor the trafficking of labeled stem cells by molecular and cellular imaging. A cell-labeling strategy is currently performed using the probes incorporated into the cells or transfecting the reporter genes into the genome. Nanotechnology that provided the functional elements at the nanoscale level is an enabling technology with great potential for applications in cell-based therapy. 1, 2 Traditionally, the fate of the transplanted stem cells is generally assessed by direct labeling in vitro with fluorescent dyes, radionuclides (e.g., Indium 111 oxine), and thymidine base analogs (e.g., BrdU), or indirect labeling through transfected genes, such as fluorescent protein (e.g., GFP) or other reporter proteins (e.g., luciferase). However, several limitations exist, such as the dilution or exclusion of the imaging probes after labeling of cells, insertional mutagenesis of the transfected cells, changes of cell phenotypes and functions, and the compounded issues with tissue autofluorescence. 3, 4 In comparison to the traditional fluorescent probes, such as fluorescent proteins and small-molecule dyes, nanoparticle-based probes are advantageous in terms of their photostabilities and minimal alterations to the cell phenotypes and functions.",

In comparison to other modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging, photoacoustic imaging, positron emission tomography, and computed tomography, optical imaging possesses distinctive advantages, such as low cost, easy accessibility, high spatial and temporal sensitivity, large in vitro and in vivo throughputs, and greater potential for clinical translation. 6 For example, QDs are a very popular fluorescent platform that can be used with single-or multiphoton imaging techniques. Although QDs have been adopted and highly regarded as a fluorescence imaging medium, the application is hampered by their potential toxicity (e.g., CdSe QDs are trapped in endosomes/lysosomes after endocytosis) and facile degradation (e.g., the decline of fluorescence as pH decreases). 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Indeed, the existence of heavy metals in QDs, such as cadmium, a wellestablished human toxicant and carcinogen, poses potential dangers especially for future medical application. As the use of nanomaterials for biomedical applications is increasing, environmental pollution and toxicity have to be addressed, and the development of a nontoxic and biocompatible nanomaterial is becoming an important issue. Fluorescent nanodiamond (FND), a new member in the nanocarbon family, has recently emerged as a promising nanotechnology imaging probe for biomedical applications. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] FNDs combine the advantages of QDs (small size, high photostability, and bright multicolor fluorescence) with biocompatibility, nontoxicity, and rich surface chemistry that have the potential to revolutionize imaging applications.

The natural diamonds have aggregated nitrogen defects (type Ia diamonds), while synthetic diamonds manufactured under high-temperature and high-pressure conditions are mainly embellished with single-substitutional nitrogen centers (type Ib diamonds). 19, 20 Irradiation damage of type Ib diamond nanocrystallites generates intrinsic defects, such as vacancies in the diamond structure. During thermal annealing, these vacancies move toward nitrogen centers and get trapped within to form nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color defect centers. Then these centers lead to useful fluorescence properties. When excited by green-yellow light (515-560 nm), the fluorophores (e.g., the negatively charged NV centers, NV \u2212 ) built in the FND emit stable far-red emission (600-800 nm) with a fluorescence lifetime (\u03c4) of greater than 15 ns. 13, 21 In addition, when photoexcited with 8 kW/cm 2 power density of light for 5 min, no photobleaching occurred in FNDs. In contrast, under the same conditions, the fluorescence of an Alexa Fluor dye photobleached and faded completely in 12 s. 12, 13 Furthermore, no fluorescence blinking was detected within a time resolution of 1 ms. 13 Overall, the extreme photostability of the NV \u2212 defect centers provides a great advantage to FNDs to emerge as an excellent candidate for long-term cellular imaging and tracking.",

The majority of cell autofluorescence originates from mitochondria and lysosomes. Together with aromatic amino acids and lipopigments, the most important endogenous fluorophores are pyridinic (NADPH) and flavin coenzymes. In tissues, the extracellular matrix often contributes to the autofluorescence emission more than the cellular component because collagen and elastin have, among the endogenous fluorophores, a relatively high quantum yield. The absorption and emission waves of cellular endogenous fluorophores, ranging from 400 to 500 nm, overlap with most of the organic fluorophores used for cellular imaging. The far-red fluorescence emission of FND, peaking at about 700 nm, is well separated from the cellular autofluorescence region of biological specimens. 12, 13 Another important parameter that could be utilized to improve the image contrast of fluorescence probes within a biological environment is the issue of fluorescence lifetime. The fluorescence lifetime is defined as the time the fluorophore remains in the excited state before returning to the ground state. The average fluorescence lifetime of FNDs is 17 ns, which is considerably longer than that typical of tissue autofluorescence or common fluorescent imaging dyes (\u03c4 < 6 ns). 22, 23 By fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and various nanosecond time-gating techniques, it is possible to separate FND emission from the strong autofluorescence background of host tissue. 21, 24, 25 ",

FNDs in the size range of 100 nm were produced by ion irradiation and thermal annealing of type Ib diamond powders, followed by air oxidation and purification in strong oxidative acids. 14 As mentioned, FNDs are novel imaging probes that are not only chemically robust and fluorescently stable, but also biologically inert and nontoxic. Therefore, FNDs might be an alternative for the long-term labeling of stem cells. In the past few years, several biocompatibility and cytotoxicity studies have been conducted to examine cell viability, oxidative stress, DNA damage, and physiological processes in vivo after labeling of cells with FNDs. 26, 27 It was shown that FNDs could be used in many cell lines without obvious cytotoxicity, such as kidney (HEK 293T), 12 lung (A549 and HFL-1), 28, 29 neuronal (Neuro2a), 30 and cervical (HeLa) cells. 31, 32 The internalization of FNDs did not affect the cell viability and cell division, as assessed by monitoring mitochondrial function and luminescent ATP production. 26 By time-lapse imaging and flow cytometric analysis, it was observed that the number of FND nanoparticles were divided nearly equally between daughter cells during cell division, and the fluorescence intensity in each cell decreased exponentially with time due to cell proliferation. 32 Moreover, FND-labeled 3T3-L1 preadipocyte and 489-2.1 osteoprogenitor cells did not have any cytotoxic or detrimental effects on the proliferation and differentiation potential of these cells. 31 With flow cytometry, transmission electron microscope, and the use of a series of metabolic and cytoskeletal inhibitors, it was found that the mechanism of the FND uptake in cells was facilitated via energy-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis. 28, 31 Additionally, no significant exocytosis of FNDs was found during cell proliferation. 32 Besides these cellular studies, some histopathological examinations have been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of nanodiamonds in vivo. The intratracheally administered nanodiamonds did not cause any pulmonary toxicity; the amount of nanodiamonds in alveolar cells decreased with time, and the macrophages burdened with nanodiamonds were clearly observed in the bronchia for approximately 1 month after exposure. 33 Moreover, the intradermal, subcutaneous, and intraperitoneal injections of nanodiamonds did not induce any inflammatory reactions and systemic toxicity in mice and rats. 34, 35 On microinjection into wild-type Caenorhabditis elegans, FNDs were dispersed in the gonad, delivered to the embryos, and eventually into the hatched larvae in the next generation. 17 Recently, Simpson et al. had also demonstrated that microinjected FNDs were effective nanoscale fluorescent probes for determining the intracellular dynamics in developing Drosophila embryos. 36 Overall, FNDs are photostable, biocompatible, and nontoxic, which have potential use in labeling, imaging, and tracking of the cellular and developmental processes in vitro and in vivo. 18, 37 In our recent work, we also demonstrated that FND labeling did not impair the biological functions of LSCs. 25 ",

Of note, the neuroendocrine cells are found to be residing individually or as clusters in neuroepithelial bodies in the distal airway. 42 The alveolar epithelium that leads by terminal bronchioles are composed of two epithelial cell types, alveolar type I pneumocytes (AECI) and alveolar type II pneumocytes (AECII). AECI cells, which are essential for gas exchange, are large flat squamous cells covering about 95% of the alveolar surface. The relatively smaller, granular, and roughly cuboidal AECII cells, which produce surfactant components, critical for the maintenance of alveolar integrity, 43 contribute to only \u223c5% of the alveolar surface.

            "text": "Endogenous LSCs have been found to be able to renew and proliferate to epithelial cells in vivo. They are potentially useful in regenerative therapy, such as repairing damaged lung tissue in patients. During the pseudoglandular stage of lung development, the distal tips of the branching tubules appear to contain the undifferentiated multipotent Id2 + tip cells that can self-renew and contribute descendents to all epithelial cell lineages. 44 Following postnatal growth, the lung epithelium slowly turns over (\u223c1% per day) under normal conditions, but its regenerative capacity can be substantially activated after injury. 45, 46 The large surface area, numerous branches, and folded topography suggest that lung tissue may have several stem or progenitor cell types. Different regional stem cells in lung are responsible for postnatal lung growth, homeostasis, and repair of the injured lungs, and contribute differently to local needs in times of tissue damage. 47 For example, in trachea and main stem bronchi, a subset of basal cells are the dominant epithelial stem cell type responsible for homeostasis and injury repair, which possess a capacity to different into the basal, ciliated, goblet, and granular secretory cells in vivo. 48, 49 Several cellular markers, including the cytokeratin 5, cytokeratin 14, integrin \u03b16, and nerve growth factor receptor, have been employed in the identification and isolation of basal cells. 50, 51 On the other hand, in the gas exchange alveolar epithelium, a subset of AECII cells have been recognized as precursors for AECI cells in the adult lung. By 3 H-thymidine labeling, clonogenic assays, and genetic lineage tracing analysis, AECII cells are able to proliferate and restore the alveolar epithelium by giving rise to either new AECII or the squamous AECI cells following an injury. [23] [24] [25] Moreover, in an attempt to identify biomarkers for AECII stem cells, a subset of prosurfactant protein C (SP-C) \u2212 /integrin \u03b16\u03b24 + cells are found to sporadically localize in alveolar epithelia and possess the capacity for proliferation, further differentiation of SP-C + AECII, and regeneration of lung structures. 26 To date, at least a subset of basal, secretory, and mucous cells in the submucosal glands of the proximal airways, variant club cells in the bronchioles, bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) in the BADJ of terminal bronchioles ( Fig. 1.1.1) , and a subset of AECII cells in alveolar space have been suggested to be as region-specific epithelial stem/progenitor cells in the adult lung of mice and humans. 38, 39, [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] In the distal airway, the bronchiolar epithelium is quiescent until injury. Following naphthalene-mediated club cell ablation, a small number of naphthalene-resistant club cells (termed variant club cells) survive and regenerate all differentiated distal bronchiolar cell types. 54, 55 These variant club cells expressing club cell secretory protein (CCSP), but not CyP450-2F2 (CCSP + , CyP450-2F2 \u2212 ), are located within the neuroepithelial bodies and the BADJ. Kim et al. also identified a subpopulation of club cells that coexpress CCSP and SP-C, referred to as BASCs, which is another naphthalene-resistant progenitor cell population located at the BADJ. 56 Using a naphthalene-or bleomycin-induced murine lung injury model, they further demonstrated that these cells possessed a capacity for self-renewal and injury repair in vivo and an ability to differentiate into club cells and alveolar epithelial cells. 56 In addition to BASCs, our lab had previously reported a serum free-selective culture procedure to sustain preferential growth of the lung colonies, which was further supported by pulmonary mesenchymal cells in the surrounding. 59 The Oct-4-expressing cell population also residing in the terminal bronchiolar region of neonatal lungs was introduced as a putative neonatal lung stem/progenitor cell that is capable of being cultured in vitro for weeks and induced to differentiate into AECII and AECI cells. Interestingly, these cells were susceptible to infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, raising the possibility that LSCs may be specific disease targets. 59 Therefore, our study suggests that the LSCs could be targets for environmental agents, including pneumotropic pathogens.",

On one hand, it is conceivable that different populations of stem cells could be isolated from different regions of lung tissues. Several comprehensive analyses, such as transcriptomic and proteomic analyses, had been used to elucidate the gene and protein expression profiles and determine novel molecular markers. However, specific surface markers on cells are more valuable for the isolation of stem cells, but many commonly used stem cell markers are often adopted from phenotypic characteristics of other cell types, such as hematopoietic cell lineages, with limited insight into the specific stem cells under study.",

            "text": "Although several putative markers of stem cell subpopulations for lung tissue have been studied in great detail, such as the BASCs at BADJ and the basal cells in proximal airways, a specific marker for unambiguous identification and isolation of LSCs has not been defined yet. [60] [61] [62] More specific surface markers are thus needed for the preparation of a homogenous population of LSCs. 39 As more than 85% of cell surface components are glycosylated, the glycomic analysis is useful to probe the stem cell and cancer cell surface systematically in search for novel glycoproteins and glycolipids. 63, 64 Recently we took another step forward by developing a new and prospective isolation method to obtain LSCs with glycoproteomics analysis ( Fig. 1.1.2A ). 25 Briefly, alkynyl sugar derivatives can be incorporated into glycoproteins, which can be tagged with biotin azide using click chemistry, permitting their enrichment from proteomes via affinity capture with immobilized avidin. 65 Following tryptic digestion on beads, the protein ID can be identified by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) ( Fig. 1.1.2A) . From such an analysis, we identified a total of 164 proteins, of which only 83 were uniquely expressed in the LSC-enriched cell population. Examination with UniProt database indicated that 14% of these 83 glycoproteins were plasma membrane proteins (e.g., 12 surface markers). According to the real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunofluorescent staining, it was found that CD157 (bone marrow stromal cell antigen 1, BST-1) was specifically expressed on the cell surface of LSC colonies than other types of more differentiated lung cells ( Fig. 1.1.2B ). In addition, it was also shown that CD157 + cells in lung section are located at terminal bronchioles and BADJ upon immunohistochemical analysis ( Fig. 1.1 .2B), consistent with the BrdU retaining cells in our previous study. 59 Therefore, CD157 was used as one new surface marker in ensuing experiments for prospective isolation of LSCs. 25 Through fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) with staining with two specific cell surface markers (CD54 and CD157), propidium iodide, and the CD45 antibody, we achieved the isolation of a subpopulation of cells highly enriched for LSCs from neonatal lung tissues. 25 These CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells were not only capable of self-renewal, but could also maintain colony morphology after serial passages ( Fig. 1.1.2C) . Furthermore, these isolated cells could be cryopreserved and thawed without significant loss of their ability for cell renewal and extensive expansion. Similar to the originally isolated LSCs, the cobblestone-like cell morphology was maintained after expansion. To fully characterize the sorted CD45 \u2212 CD54 + CD157 + cells, immunofluorescence analysis was first performed at the time of isolation. These isolated cells expressed the club cell marker (CCSP) and the epithelial cell marker (cytokertain-7) but not pneumocytes markers. 25 After 7-10 days of culture in growth medium, there were no changes in the expression of these markers ( Fig. 1.1.2C ). 5 Isolation and characterization of CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + lung stem cells In addition to the ability of self-renewal and expansion, we also examined whether the sorted and expanded CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells possessed the capacity of stem cells for differentiation. After 7 days of incubation in induction medium, the cell shape became flattened, the size became larger, and the AECII cell marker (SP-C) expression was detected in the cytoplasm close to the perinuclear region, which is indicative of cell differentiation into AECII cells ( Fig. 1.1.2D ). 25 Extension of the incubation to 14 days led to further flattening and enlargement of the cells (approximately fivefold greater than that of the original undifferentiated cells). These morphological changes were accompanied with a decrease in SP-C expression and an increase in (A) Workflow of the glycoproteomic analysis.

In addition to far-red fluorescence, data collected in the side scatter channel (SSC) also provide useful information on the FND uptake. 25, 32 This is due to the fact that diamond has the highest refractive index of all transparent minerals, and diamond nanoparticles scatter light strongly in the visible region and thus produce strong SSC signals. By properly gating the bivariate plot (SSC versus far-red) in quadrants, two distinct separate populations of FND-labeled and unlabeled cells could be detected in these two channels. 25, 32 The double-positive cell population, denoted as SSC + Far-red + , was subsequently identified as the FND-labeled cells without additional staining. 25, 32 Furthermore, our analysis revealed that both the control and FND-labeled LSCs were able to undergo morphological alterations and express SP-C on day 7 after induction of LSCs to form AECII cells, implying that the endocytic FNDs do not change the apparent biological functions of stem cells ( Fig. 1.1.3 ). 25 Furthermore, no interference of FNDs was detected in the differentiation from AECII to AECI, suggesting that FNDs did not impair the biological functions of these LSCs ( Fig. 1.1.3) . 25 In addition, we tracked the proliferation of the FND-labeled LSCs continuously over 2 weeks by flow cytometry and found that the CD45 \u2212 CD54 + CD157 + LSCs labeled with FNDs were viable and continued proliferate for at least 2 weeks (approximately seven divisions), suggesting that the extent of the FND exocytosis is low.",

The fraction of the SSC + Far-red + cells, however, decreased to 0.2 and 0.1%, respectively, on day 4 and 7 after the injection. To further verify whether the SSC + Far-red + cells sorted by FACS were truly the FND-labeled CD45 -CD54 + CD157 + cells that we has injected, lung tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for a morphological analysis. The time-gating technique had similarly been applied to image lung tissues prepared on days 1, 4, and 7. Again, the FND fluorescence (red spots) could be readily distinguished from the background fluorescence with the time gated at >7 ns ( Fig. 1.1.4D-E) . Further confirmation of the FNDs was made by prolonged excitation, which did not lead to any significant decrease in fluorescence intensity, consistent with the characteristic of FND fluorescence. 12, 13 From the merged images of bright-field H&E staining and TGF, it was found that while some FND-labeled LSCs were trapped in interalveolar spaces ( Fig. 1.1.4A ), many of them resided close Labeling of the prospectively isolated LSCs with FNDs did not eliminate the abilities of stem cells for proliferation and differentiation into type I and type II pneumocytes in vitro.

Naphthalene causes lung injury mainly to distal bronchiolar club cells without significantly depleting alveolar epithelial cells in the mouse. 66, 67 As shown in Fig. 1.1 .5, mice received either normal saline or 275 mg/kg naphthalene, intraperitoneally; 2 days later, the FND-labeled LSCs were injected into lung-injured or control mice via i.v. administration. Mice were sacrificed at different time points and organs were collected to search for the injected LSCs by fluorescence microscopy ( Fig. 1.1.5A ). As mentioned, the high-autofluorescence background prevented clear identification of these cells in the lungs. Thanks to the distinct fluorescence lifetime of the NV \u2212 center, this undesirable effect could be largely removed with FLIM and TGF. Fig. 1.1 .5B shows FLIM images of the lung tissue collected on day 7. The injected cells can be clearly discerned, even when the cells are stained with H&E to aid histological examination ( Fig. 1.1.5B, arrows) . First, the FND-labeled LSCs preferentially reside at the terminal bronchioles of the lungs on day 7 after i.v. administration, which was confirmed by TGF imaging of the tissue sections of naphthalene-injured mice with single-cell resolution ( Fig. 1.1.5B ). Additionally, the damaged lung cells can rapidly recover after transplantation of the FND-labeled LSCs into the mice, as shown by the increase in pan-cytokeratin (Pan-CK + ) and CCSP + epithelial cells ( Fig. 1.1.3 ). An important implication of the present study is that the prospectively isolated LSCs are potentially useful as a new cell source for stem cell-based therapy in regenerative medicine. In such experiments, injury and repair of the bronchiolar epithelium were assessed by immunostaining of the club cells specific marker, CCSP, on day 1 and 7 after injury and injection. It was found that on day 1, the bronchiolar epithelium of lung-injured mice was sparsely surrounded by cells expressing CCSP in both the control (saline-treated) and FND LSC-treated mouse groups. On day 7, although some progress of club cell regeneration occurred in the saline-treated mice, the bronchiolar epithelium of the FND LSC-treated mice displayed a significantly enhanced repopulation of club cells and CCSP staining ( Fig. 1.1.3 ). 25 The almost complete restoration of club cells suggests that the transplanted FND-labeled LSCs are involved in lung repair and homeostasis. The suggestion was additionally supported by flow cytometric identification of SSC + Far-red + cells, which revealed that from day 1 up to day 7 after LSC injection in the injury mice, approximately 0.8-0.91% of the total population of viable cells was associated with FND-labeled LSCs in the lungs. In other words, the percentage of the FND-labeled LSCs did not show any pronounced decrease for an entire week after naphthalene treatment ( Fig. 1.1.5B ), 25 a situation totally differing from that of the uninjured mice. This discrepancy in the results between the experiments with uninjured and injured mice demonstrated the homing capacity of the FND-labeled LSCs.",

Furthermore, to provide a semiquantitative estimate for the stem cell-homing efficiency, we calculate the proportion of the FND-labeled cells that homed to lung (P h ) with the following equation, 68 where N v equals the percent of FND-labeled cells determined by flow cytometry, P s equals the total number of cells in the lung, and N t equals the number of cells actually transplanted ( Fig. 1.1.5C ). In our experiment, the number of FND-labeled cells transplanted to mice in each experiment was 5 \u00d7 10 5 . The total number of cells isolated from mouse lung tissue was approximately 10 7 cells, of which about 70% were viable cells (PI \u2212 ). Moreover, the SSC + Far-red + cells (i.e., the FND-labeled cells) in the PI \u2212 gate was 1.6% on day 1, which declined to 0.12% on day 7 in normal (uninjured) mice. Thus, the proportion of the transplanted cells that homed to lung (P h ) could be estimated as \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 = [1.6% (10 70%)/5 10 ] 22% 7 5 . Similar calculation resulted in the decrease of the proportion of the transplanted cells that remained in lung to become 1.4% (i.e., \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 = [0.12% (10 70%)/5 10 ] 1.4% 7 5 . Therefore, in normal (uninjured) mice, there was a significant decrease of the value from 22% of the transplanted cells in the lung on day 1 to 1.4% on day 7 ( Fig. 1.1.5C ). In other words, most of the transplanted cells initially entrapped in the lung had now disappeared from the lung on day 7. In sharp contrast, similar calculations for the lung injury model revealed that the proportion of the transplanted FND-labeled cells that homed to lung did not show significant decrease after 7 days (i.e., 14% on day 1 and 11% on day 7) (Fig. 1.1.5C ). These results seemed to imply that the lodgment of the transplanted FND-labeled cells in injured model is indicative of \"proactive\" homing, but not nonspecific (or passive) entrapment.",

A previous study has found that CXCR4/CXCL12 are markers essential for stem cell homing and recruitment of circulating epithelial progenitor cells to the specific site of airway injury. 72 In this study, CXCR4 was indeed expressed on CD45 \u2212 CD54 + CD157 + cells and in colony cells under serum free-selective culture, suggesting that the marker may also facilitate homing of these cells to the regenerating epithelium after transplantation. 25 ",

            "text": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of human acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is at the epicenter of a global epidemic affecting millions of people. 1 This constitutes a major problem, especially in developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa, where prevalence and transmission rates are higher and access to treatment and prevention are still limited. 2 Current treatment relies on the use of multiple antiretroviral drugs that can inhibit different steps of the virus infection cycle. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) is able to improve the health of patients particularly when started early after infection, but lifelong treatment is required. 3, 4 Therapeutic regimens are often hard to implement, especially when considering the poor patient adherence and side effects. 5 As a feasible cure of HIV infection is unlikely to be available in the near future, control of the epidemic relies largely on preventive interventions. 6, 7 Among those recently proven effective, oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)-already approved in several countries, such as the United States, Canada, and France-and topical microbicides (also referred to as topical PrEP) may be particularly promising to fulfill unmet needs in averting new infections. 8 Despite the exciting results of oral PrEP in men who have sex with men, protection among heterosexual women has been shown inconsistent. 9 Issues related with poor adherence or biological differences between routes of transmission (vaginal vs. rectal) may be involved. Also, oral PrEP can be limited by the onset of systemic adverse effects as also typically seen with cART. Topical microbicides have struggled throughout roughly the last quarter of a century to achieve proof of concept in human clinical trials, but recent successes may boost further investment in their development and market introduction. The dapivirine vaginal ring is at the forefront, but other products will likely rise in coming years. 10 Rectal microbicides are also under development, but advances have been slower. 11 It is recognized that drug formulation and delivery plays an important role in developing topical microbicides. 12 Many strategies involving the use of more conventional dosage forms or novel delivery systems have been proposed and tested for various anti-HIV compounds. This subchapter describes recent developments in the field of nanotechnology-based carrier systems for the delivery of antiretroviral compounds and for the purpose of topical prevention of sexual HIV transmission.",

            "text": "The UNAIDS estimates that around 36.7 million people worldwide were living with HIV by the end of 2015, while 2.1 million became newly infected during that single year. 13 Type 1 virus (HIV-1) accounts for most cases, as it is easier to transmit and more virulent than type 2 HIV. 6 Transmission may occur through sexual, blood, or vertical (mother-to-child) contacts, although the majority of the infection burden arises from unprotected sex. 14 When at the cervicovaginal or rectal mucosae, the virus can exploit several pathways to reach its main target cells, namely CD4 + cells. 15 HIV can also infect other cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Fig. 1. 2.1 presents a schematic representation of the main mechanisms and possible pathways behind transmission at the cervicovaginal mucosa. 16 Lack of a cure for HIV/AIDS makes prevention an essential approach in the fight against the epidemic. While an effective vaccine is still elusive, 17 several modalities are currently available and have been proven as, at least, partially effective (Table 1.2.1). 18, 19 However, large-scale implementation of preventive measures has been shown to be a huge challenge requiring further investment, namely on novel strategies. Avoiding sexual transmission in particular is urgently needed. Alongside oral PrEP with antiretroviral drugs, the possibility of delivering anti-HIV compounds by the vaginal and/ or rectal routes has attracted considerable attention. 20, 21 Microbicides can be defined as products for vaginal and/or rectal delivery that can block early viral transmission events at the mucosal level. Microbicides are considered particularly important, as they may represent a means for women at risk to protect themselves without the need of consent, cooperation, or even knowledge of the male partner. Even if unlikely to confer full protection, microbicides may still have an important role in averting HIV infection when combined with other preventive strategies. 22 Contrary to oral PrEP, antiretroviral drugs are intended to concentrate at mucosae and do not reach systemic circulation in significant levels, thus contributing to ameliorate adverse effects. The development of products intended to circumvent anogenital mucosal transmission of the virus received a much needed boost with the recent release of the results of two phase 3 clinical trials testing a dapivirine vaginal ring. 23, 24 Still, this tentative microbicide product was shown to be only mildly effective, reducing the transmission from men to women by 27%-31% as compared to the placebo ring. These results were in line with those of a tenofovir gel tested in the CAPRISA 004 phase 2b clinical trial, the first and only other study showing protection for vaginal microbicides. 25 Combined, the partial success of these trials suggests that additional work in developing novel solutions may be useful for potentially improving efficacy of microbicides. As for rectal microbicides, development is still in earlier stages, and human efficacy studies have not been conducted yet. 26 Once considered an issue of lesser relevance, microbicide drug formulation has taken an essential place during development by its own. 12 Formulation efforts should lead to stable, safe, and potentially effective products that should also be accepted by users. Presently, it is well established that a relationship between pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics exists for several microbicide drugs, namely dapivirine and tenofovir, by which higher local concentrations are related with enhanced protection. 27, 28 Adequate design of vaginal and rectal products may contribute to increased and sustained drug levels. Most products developed so far rely on conventional dosage forms, particularly gels. These are considered practical and cheap to manufacture, but limitations exist, such as potentially poor physicochemical and microbiological stability, alongside issues concerning leakage and messiness upon administration. 29 Moreover, the use of gels is coitus dependent, that is, products require to be administered immediately before and/or after every sexual intercourse to be effective. This raises issues concerning adherence and has been regarded as one of the most challenging topics influencing the efficacy of microbicides. 30 Other dosage forms have also been considered, namely tablets, capsules, suppositories, creams, solutions, suspensions, and foams, 31 but the advances in development have been slow, presumably because no or limited advantages exist when compared to gels. Vaginal films are seen as an interesting alternative dosage form to gels, namely due to their compact size, increased stability, and decreased ability to cause vaginal leakage. 32 In particular, a film containing dapivirine has been tested recently in a phase 1 clinical trial, and results suggested that it was safe and provided potentially protective genital drug levels. 33 However, films are not suitable for rectal administration and, alongside other more conventional dosage forms, are limited by the need to be administered every time sexual intercourse occurs. Vaginal rings have been engineered to deliver different antiretroviral drugs for use as coitus-independent microbicides. 34 Once placed in the vagina, rings can release drugs in a sustained fashion for up to several weeks or even months. Notwithstanding the potential to abbreviate adherence issues, the dapivirine ring provided only modest protection to women, as described before in this subchapter. More data are required to fully understand such results, but frequent ring removal, particularly around the time of sexual intercourse, is a possible explanation. 35 Another important aspect that needs to be stressed concerns the specificity of the vaginal and rectal routes. As mentioned before, some dosage forms are route specific, namely rings and films. Apart from that, the biology of the vaginal and rectal milieu require to be considered to meet requirements of safety, administration, distribution, and overall local PK. Description of the main characteristics of the vagina and colorectum is beyond the scope of this manuscript. Details on the main anatomical, histological, and physiological features of both these routes, with particular relevance to the development of microbicides, can be found in previous publications by our research group. 26, 36, 37 ",

            "text": "Advances in the field of nanomedicine have been tremendous over the last decades, with several nanotechnology-based drug products already reaching markets worldwide. 38 Such encouraging achievements boosted interest in applying nanotechnology to healthcare and the field of HIV treatment and prevention was no exception. 39, 40 Development of nanomicrobicides has been receiving increasing interest but, as in the case of more conventional drug delivery approaches, mostly for providing protection from vaginal HIV transmission. Microbicide nanosystems may be conveniently classified as those possessing inherent activity, either by interacting directly with HIV or blocking virus-host cell interactions, and those acting as carriers for anti-HIV compounds. 41 In the first case, dendrimers have been the focus of extensive development. 42 In particular, the SPL7013 dendrimer has been formulated as a gel (VivaGel; Starpharma, Abbotsford, Victoria, Australia) and tested as a vaginal microbicide. This fourth-generation dendrimer comprises polylysine branches attached to a central core of benzhydrylamine amide. Polylysines are terminally derivatized with naphthalene disulfonate groups, which are responsible for interacting with HIV-1, particularly with gp-120. 43 Viral gp-120 is an envelope glycoprotein that plays a crucial role in infection by binding to the CD4 receptor and one coreceptor (CCR5 or CXCR4) present in host cell membranes. 44 VivaGel underwent a series of promising clinical trials, 45, 46 but the possible onset of safety issues seems to have halted its development as a microbicide product. 47, 48 The use of gels formulated for the rectal delivery of SPL7013 has also been explored. 49 Recently, various carbosilane dendrimers have been proposed as a promising alternative and in vitro and in vivo data seem to attest their potential. 50 Over roughly the last decade, research in nanotechnology-based microbicides has mainly focused on the development of nanocarriers for promising anti-HIV compounds, namely antiretroviral drugs already tested in clinical trials. Following release of the results of the CAPRISA 004 trial, tenofovir and its derivatives became immediate candidates for developing drug-loaded nanosystems. Different types of nanocarriers intended for vaginal delivery have been developed, including solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs), 51 chitosan and thiolated chitosan nanoparticles (NPs), 52,53 pH-sensitive poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), Eudragit S100 NPs, 54 and hyaluronidasesensitive hyaluronic acid NPs. 55 Nanofibers loaded with tenofovir have also been recently proposed for developing vaginal microbicides. 56, 57 Apart from tenofovir, a wide variety of vaginal nanocarriers have further been developed for other anti-HIV compounds, namely PSC-RANTES-loaded PLGA NPs, 58 dapivirine-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) NPs, 59 efavirenz/raltegravir-loaded PLGA NPs, 60 efavirenz-or saquinavir-loaded PLGA NPs, 61 saquinavir-loaded CD4-targeted PLGA NPs, 62 dapivirine-loaded PLGA NPs, 63 efavirenz-loaded cellulose acetate phthalate (CAP) NPs, 64 and efavirenz/curcumin-loaded lactoferrin NPs. 65 Overall, advantageous features of using nanosystems for the vaginal delivery of active compounds may include controlled release, enhanced solubility, protection of labile molecules, improved distribution throughout the mucosa, modulation of mucoadhesive behavior, improved interactions with host cells (e.g., by leading to higher intracellular drug concentrations or providing targeted drug delivery to HIV-susceptible cells), or enhanced drug penetration/accumulation in genital tissues. 66 One issue that has been the focus of intense research and discussion over the last decade relates with the mucoadhesive behavior of nanosystems. 67, 68 Once regarded as advantageous, extensive interaction with cervicovaginal mucus is now considered as potentially deleterious, as decreased transport of nanosystems can result in poor ability to reach epithelial linings and interact with cells of interest. 69 Different strategies have been described to decrease mucoadhesion, 70 but dense surface modification of NPs with relatively short-chain, linear poly(ethylene oxide) [PEO, also commonly referred to as poly(ethylene glycol)], has been preferential. 71, 72 Research on rectal nanomicrobicides has been nearly nonexistent and much work is still required. 73 The same advantages pointed out earlier for the vaginal administration of nanosystems may apply. For example, data from animal studies and human clinical trials indicate that NPs may be an interesting approach to improve distribution and retention throughout the colorectum, as well as to enhance transport across the mucus barrier. 74, 75 Only a few specific studies have been described regarding nanomicrobicides. For example, data from in vitro and ex vivo studies with cells or animal colorectal tissues support that dapivirine-loaded PCL NPs may be successfully engineered to be safe and effective when considering rectal administration. 76 In another study, nanoconjugates of the protease inhibitor amprenavir, PEO, and a cell penetrating peptide (Bac7) were found particularly useful for enhancing drug uptake into colorectal tissue when administered intrarectally to mice. 77 ",

Although possessing potent anti-HIV-1 activity, dapivirine presents some problematic features, namely poor solubility in aqueous vehicles, which limits formulation approaches. 78 Our group has been engaged over the years in developing different polymeric NP carriers as an alternative for the vaginal delivery of dapivirine. These NPs have been extensively evaluated in vitro for stability, toxicity, activity, interaction with various cell types and mucus-like fluids, and cell monolayer/tissue permeability and drug retention. 59, 63, 76, [79] [80] [81] [82] For example, PCL NPs have been shown to maintain the antiviral activity of dapivirine upon encapsulation ( Fig. 1.2. 2), but modulated toxicity differently according to selected particle stabilizer: PEO-modified NPs improved toxicity profile, while the incorporation of sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in particle composition did not generally change or increase cytotoxicity, respectively. 59,76 PCL NPs were further shown to penetrate both pig vaginal and rectal mucosae ex vivo ( Fig. 1.2. 3), while enhancing dapivirine accumulation at tissues. 76 In particular, a PEO-modified, PCL-based nanoparticulate system presenting mean hydrodynamic diameter around 200 nm emerged as an optimal candidate for the delivery of dapivirine and was further tested in vivo.",

Fast particle depletion was associated with the use of PBS instead of a solid or semisolid vehicle that could tackle, at least partially, leakage from the vagina. Noticeably, NPs were still able to penetrate vaginal mucosa to a few tens of micrometers deep ( Fig. 1.2.4) , thus potentially assuring a drug depot within tissue. 83 Local PK were also assessed up to 24 h post-administration of 5 \u00b5g of dapivirine (in 25 \u00b5L of PBS), either associated to NPs or in suspension ( Fig. 1.2 .5). 83 Results showed that NPs were able to better sustain drug levels in vaginal lavages, vaginal tissue, and, partially, the lower half of the uterine horns, despite an overall fast decrease of dapivirine amounts in the genital tract. Vaginal lavage drug levels seem to have been maintained above levels previously found protective in a humanized mouse model 84 for up to 24 h in animals treated with NPs, but only up to 4 h in the case of dapivirine in suspension. 83 Furthermore, dapivirine was able to reach ",

            "text": "Rilpivirine is a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor from the same chemical class as dapivirine, being currently used in AIDS therapy. 85 This drug is also being developed as a long-acting, NP-based injectable to be used as PrEP 86 . In a recent report, Kovarova et al. 87 proposed and evaluated for efficacy of a nanotechnologybased formulation of rilpivirine in humanized BLT mice. PEO-modified PLGA NPs (mean hydrodynamic diameter = 66 nm) were selected as drug carriers, being further incorporated into a poloxamer-based thermosensitive gel that undergoes sol-gel transition at body temperature. Drug concentration in the gel was approximately 0.09% (w/w). The use of such gel has been adapted from previous work undertaken by one of the author's research group to allow ease of administration and enhanced vaginal retention of NPs and rilpivirine. 60, 64 Animals treated intravaginally with 20 \u00b5L of rilpivirine-loaded NPs gel at 1.5 h before viral challenge (310,000 TCID 50 of CCR5tropic HIV-1 RHPA ) were fully protected from infection. 87 Protection decreased to 50% when the time elapsed from gel administration to viral challenge was extended to 24 h. All control mice were infected by HIV irrespective of the time of administration. The authors of the study claimed that observed protective effects were linked with the formation of a layer of NPs covering the cervicovaginal epithelium that partially persisted up to 24 h post-administration. 87 NPs were also able to penetrate tissues up till the vicinities of HIV-susceptible cells. Although no PK data were provided, results suggest that a significant amount of drug was retained in the vagina for up to at least 24 h. Additionally, assessment of the real value of these NPs and gel formulation in providing protection is not easy, as controls containing free rilpivirine were not included in the study. ",

In a recently reported study, Destache et al. 90 incorporated TDF into PLGA NPs (mean hydrodynamic diameter = 149 nm) using sodium deoxycholate as an ion-pairing agent. The addition of sodium deoxycholate allowed enhanced drug association to NPs by about 4 times. NPs were further incorporated into poloxamer-based thermosensitive gels at different TDF concentrations to facilitate vaginal administration. Gels were administered to humanized BLT mice before intravaginal challenge with HIV-1. All animals treated with placebo thermosensitive gel and challenged after 4 h were infected. Conversely, mice were fully protected when administered with different gels containing TDF-loaded NPs and challenged with the virus at different time points posttreatment: 0.1% TDF and 4 h or 0.5% TDF and 24 h. No protection was observed when TDF-loaded NPs in gel at 1% TDF were used at 7 days before viral challenge. 90 These results appear to support that TDF-loaded NPs in thermosensitive gels may be useful as coitus-independent effective microbicides. However, as no data for gels containing TDF alone (i.e., without incorporation into NPs) were provided, it is difficult to assess the real value of the nanocarriers in protection against viral infection. Also, the use of gels bearing different quantities of TDF when different challenge times were considered and the lack of detailed PK data make it difficult to fully understand the value of this otherwise interesting study.",

One exception has been the use of commercially available Novasome 7474 (Novavax, Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA and IGI Laboratories, Buena, New Jersey, USA) for the vaginal delivery of \u22122 RANTES, a truncated fragment of Regulated on Activation, Normal T Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) chemokine presenting high specificity for CCR5 binding. 95, 96 Novasome are 200-700 nm nonphospholipidic liposomes comprising monoesters of PEO fatty acids, cholesterol, and free fatty acids. 97 The association of \u22122 RANTES with Novasome did not affect the native activity of the protein. 95, 96 Data from an initial study by Kish-Catalone et al. 95 were able to indicate that \u22122 RANTES/ liposome complexes elicited only mild signs of inflammation when administered to mice (single dose) and rabbits (daily administration for 10 consecutive days), thus being considered acceptable for vaginal use. The efficacy of these complexes against vaginal transmission of CCR5-tropic SHIV 162P3 was further tested in cynomolgus macaques. 96 Pretreatment (30-45 min) of animals with \u22122 RANTES/liposome complexes in PBS before viral challenge resulted in partial yet significant protection as compared to animals treated with PBS alone. \u22122 RANTES in PBS solution provided no significant protection when used at a concentration up to nearly 4 times of that used for complexes. Remarkably, blank liposomes presented similar protection results as compared to those carrying \u22122 RANTES. 96 A possible explanation may be the inherent antiviral activity of Novasome 7474 as documented for other liposomal vesicles. 98, 99 In any case, the ability of liposomes to evenly distribute throughout the mucosa seems to have been important for creating a protective barrier against viral transmission. Additional studies are necessary to clarify these issues.",

Despite significant advances made in the field, 101,102 issues regarding intracellular delivery, molecular stability, and off-target effects of oligonucleotides may impair success and novel formulation approaches are required. 103 Furthermore, specificities of mucosal sites, such as the vagina may present specific additional limitations to the topical delivery of labile molecules (e.g., siRNA). 104 The role of nanotechnology in aiding RNAi-based therapeutics is well recognized, 105 but its application in the field of anti-HIV microbicides is scarce. To our best knowledge, the reports by Eszterhas et al. 106 and Boyapalle et al. 107 constitute the only studies on the subject. The first group of researchers used a commercial cationic polymer transfection agent (INTERFERin, Polyplus-transfection) to produce 45-60 nm polyplexes with CD4-and CCR5-specific siRNA. 106 Obtained nanosystems were able to partially suppress the expression of CD4 and CCR5 in ex vivo human tissue models (endometrial and cervical) for several days, as well as provide partial but significant protection from HIV challenge at 48 h posttransfection. Moreover, mild but significant silencing for several days was observed in the reproductive tract of BALB/c mice in which an aqueous dispersion of murine siRNA targeting CD4 was instilled directly into the uterus. 106 Boyapalleet al. 107 proposed an interesting system based in chitosan-Lipofectamine 2000 NPs (mean hydrodynamic diameter = 441 nm) for the delivery of a plasmid DNA coding for various siRNAs targeting viral (HIV-1 tat, rev, gag, and 5\u2032-LTR) and host (CCR5 and CXCR4) factors. An anti-inflammatory cream of unspecified composition was used as a vehicle for NP administration. In a pilot study, the cream containing the plasmid siRNA cocktail was administered intravaginally to three rhesus macaques at 6 and 3 days before, as well as on the same day of viral challenge with SHIV SF162P3 . A complete blocking of infection was not observed, although plasmatic viral loads in treated animals were significantly lower than in those receiving the cream only. Also, a 10-day study in rabbits demonstrated the safety of the cream containing NPs. Despite the fact that the reported findings of both previous studies may be considered borderline as to the ability of proposed nanosystems to prevent viral transmission, they seem to support the relevance of nanotechnology in siRNA-based microbicide development. Still, substantial work is required to optimize oligonucleotide vaginal delivery for the prevention of HIV transmission.",

Electrospun polymeric fibers in particular have been found useful as novel and versatile drug delivery platforms, and their application in the development of vaginal microbicides is being actively explored. 110, 111 Features that may be considered useful when thinking about preventing HIV transmission include: (1) large surface area of fibers, which allows enhanced interactions between fiber surface and outer environment components, including with HIV; (2) the capacity to form mesh-like structures bearing variable pore size that may restrict transport of sperm and viruses; and (3) the ability to incorporate multiple compounds with distinct physicochemical properties. 111 Alongside a few other interesting studies by Huang et al. on pH-sensitive, CAP-based fibers 112 and HIV-trapping, polystyrene-based fibers, 113 as well as those recently reported by Youan and coworkers on thiolated chitosan 56 and PEO shell/thiolated hyaluronic acid plus poly(lactic acid) shell 57 nanofibers for the delivery of tenofovir, most of the research efforts have been undertaken by Woodrow and coworkers at the University of Washington. 114 The latter researchers were able to produce multiple nanofiber formulations by electrospinning using various matrix-forming materials and composites (e.g., PEO, polyvinylpyrrolidone, PLGA, poly-l-lactide, and PCL) and incorporating variable doses of different drugs. These last included compounds with antiviral effect (e.g., zidovudine, tenofovir, maraviroc, or raltegravir) or even with different pharmacological activities.

Superimposing and interlacing nanofibers may further allow obtaining meshes with small pore diameters that can restrict pathogens and sperm mobility, thus providing additional anti-infective and contraceptive mechanisms, respectively. 115 The development of MPT products is considered highly relevant, as, apart from preventing HIV transmission, these can also be useful in averting other sexually transmitted infections and/or provide an additional contraceptive option for women. 119 Modifications in composition and electrospinning processing were shown to be easily undertaken to effectively modulate the properties of fibers (such as diameter, degradation/dissolution, surface morphology, microstructure, drug loading, and crystallinity) and resulting fabrics (i.e., thickness, tensile strength, and Young's module), which can ultimately affect drug release profiles. 115, 117, 118 Bulk fabrics were shown to be readily shaped into tampon-like shapes that may allow for convenient vaginal administration. 115 Also, successful and cost-effective scale-up of the production processes typically used in the laboratory has been demonstrated for poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)-based nanofibers (\u2248140-320 nm mean cross-sectional diameters) with tenofovir-loading values of up to 60% (w/w). 118 This ability to produce nanofibers at the industrial scale seems critical when considering that an effective and affordable microbicide will have a high market demand. In general, nanofibers produced by Woodrow and coworkers appeared to present favorable in vitro safety profiles, and that any observed toxicity seemed to have been mostly determined by used materials and active molecules. 115, 117, 120 Consistent in vivo data is still missing for these carriers, but preliminary experiments in mice evidenced that 30:70 poly-l-lactide/PEO nanofibers (around 600 nm diameter) can provide rapid and extensive coating of the vaginal mucosa as assessed using an in vivo imaging system. 115 Further developments on microbicide nanofibers are eagerly awaited.",

            "text": "To be used in practice, it is important to develop platforms for microbicide nanosystems that allow adequate stability, administration, and performance in loco (e.g., good distribution and retention throughout mucosae), while guaranteeing safety and potential effectiveness. Such platforms may be dosage forms commonly used for vaginal or rectal administration. It is impossible to establish one dosage form as a preferential from an end user's perspective (men or women), as product acceptability is widely variable among different sociodemographic and socioeconomic backgrounds. [121] [122] [123] [124] Hence, considering multiple platforms for developing nanotechnology-based microbicide products appears to be of interest. Following the footsteps of early microbicides, gels have been frequently proposed as a dosage form for incorporating microbicide nanosystems with either inherent activity (e.g., VivaGel) or acting as drug carriers. In this last case, different examples have been described in literature, particularly poloxamer-based thermosensitive gels for vaginal administration. 60, 64, 87, 90 As described in Section 3.1.2, such an approach achieves easy-to-administer liquids that promote retention once sol-gel transition occurs due to an increase in temperature. Moreover, poloxamer-based gels appear to be generally safe and not to interfere significantly with antiretroviral activity. 60, 64 Gels, however, may present several limitations when considering the development of nanomicrobicides. A general issue concerns vaginal leakage after administration. Due to their typical aqueous nature, stability issues may also arise, particularly related with the premature release of antiretroviral drugs from nanocarrier systems. Moreover, gels require the use of applicators that can increase cost (namely when single use prefilled applicators are considered), and portability is somewhat limited due to the bulkiness of gel tubes and applicators. To overcome such problems, polymeric films have been proposed as platforms for the vaginal administration of antiretroviral drug nanocarriers. 125 Vaginal films have long been used for drug delivery and are generally regarded as acceptable by women. 126 These systems usually comprise thin, flexible, smooth sheets of variable color and transparency, as well as shape (mainly square or rectangular) and area (up to 100 cm 2 ). The film matrix typically comprises hydrophilic polymers (e.g., PVA, cellulose derivatives, and carrageenan) and plasticizers (e.g., glycerin and PEO), as well as various other optional excipients (e.g., stabilizers, preservatives, and disintegrants). 127 In general, films are designed to dissolve or disintegrate rapidly to release their payload.",

[128] [129] [130] [131] For example, our group demonstrated the versatility and potential usefulness of NPs-in-film systems for delivering a combination of hydrophobic (efavirenz) and hydrophilic (tenofovir) antiretroviral drugs. 131 Efavirenz-loaded PLGA NPs and tenofovir were incorporated into the polymer matrix during manufacturing by solvent casting. Obtained films (Fig. 1.2.6) were characterized for physicochemical characteristics relevant to vaginal administration, such as organoleptic features, drug release, mechanical properties, disintegration in simulated vaginal fluid, osmolality and pH upon disintegration, and ex vivo adhesiveness to pig vaginal mucosa, and were found suitable for further animal in vivo testing. Films increased the vaginal retention of NPs in a mouse model as compared to the administration in PBS suspension. Furthermore, NPs were found to deeply penetrate the mucosa and reach the stroma. 131 PK of efavirenz in vaginal tissue and lavage were improved when the drug was associated with NPs: relative bioavailability in tissue and lavage was increased by roughly 2 and 6 times, respectively, as compared to films containing free efavirenz (i.e., directly dispersed in the film matrix without the incorporation of NPs). All drug assays were performed using a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. 132 Finally, NPs in films were shown safe as assessed by histological analysis and measurement of proinflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, KC, and TNF\u03b1) in vaginal lavages upon daily vaginal administration for 14 days. 131 These data seem to support that the tenofovir/ efavirenz-loaded NPs in film is a promising candidate microbicide product.",

            "text": "Despite the progress in modern medicine, infections continue to represent one of the greatest challenges facing humanity. Such type of infections can be broadly divided into two main categories according to the location of the patient at the time the infection developed: (1) community-acquired and (2) nosocomial (hospital-acquired) infections. Nosocomial infections occur worldwide and affect both developed and resource-poor countries, and they are mostly related to infections of surgical wounds, as well as the urinary and lower respiratory tracts. 1 Infections acquired in healthcare settings are among the major causes of death and increased morbidity among hospitalized patients, leading, consequently, to a remarkable increase in healthcare costs (only in Europe the estimated costs are \u20ac7 billion per year, including direct costs only, and reflecting 16 million extra days of hospital stay 2 ). The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) estimates that nosocomial infections contributed to 50,000 deaths only in Europe in 2011 and that an average of 7.7% of hospital patients had nosocomial infections in Europe (>2 million individuals annually) and almost 9% worldwide. 1 The increased length of stay for infected patients is the greatest contributor to costs. One study showed that the overall increase in the duration of hospitalization for patients with surgical wound infections was 8.2 days, ranging from 3 days for gynecology to 9.9 days for general surgery and up to 19.8 days for orthopedic surgery. Prolonged stay not only increases direct costs to patients or payers, but also indirect costs due to lost work. The advancing age and the greater prevalence of chronic diseases among admitted patients, as well as the increased use of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, which affect the host defenses, will provide continuing pressure on nosocomial infections in the future. The increased use of drugs, the need for isolation, and the use of additional laboratory and other diagnostic studies also contribute to costs. Additionally, rapid and long-range human mobility is now responsible for the fast geographical spread of infectious disease, making the fight against infections to be tackled globally. Nowadays, mobility and traffic have reached a complexity and volume of an unprecedented degree. More than 60 million people travel billions of miles on more than 2 million international flights each week. 3 Hundreds of millions of people S u b c h a p t e r 1.3",

Conventional microbial typing methods are reliable, but suffer from inherent time-consuming complexities. Among these methods, the most common one remains the culture of the microorganism in different media to isolate the species and identify its nature (Fig. 1.3.2A) . Sequential cultures can be avoided by implementing mass spectrometry (MS) techniques for the identification of isolated pure colonies (Fig. 1.3.2B ). These methods, including the identification by MS, require of time for the agent to grow (24-72 h). On the other hand, immunological tests to identify microorganisms are also popular. Immunological techniques, such as enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA, Fig. 1.3.2C) , fluorescence immune assay (FIA), or radioimmunoassay (RIA) offer faster results but cannot be considered as multiplex assays. Further, they require a considerable amount of sample and are expensive (\u20ac100 for each analytical kit or \u20ac100,000 for an automatized system).

This method is simple, the chemicals can be stored for certain time, and offers results that can be easily interpreted with the naked eye (i.e., it does not require extensively trained personnel). However, each reactive strip necessary to identify a single given agent in a single given sample is about \u20ac200. Furthermore, this method suffers from poor sensitivity and, thus, accumulation of microorganisms in the sample is a necessary step to allow positive detection of the target. Alternatively, some labs are introducing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to identify microorganisms through the profiling of their genetic code ( Fig. 1.3.2E ). This technique is quantitative and semimultiplex, but also laborious, slow, and expensive (\u20ac250 each analysis of sample). Overall, it can be concluded that the current methods for detection of microorganisms are flawed, with problems related to sensitivity, selectivity, speed, price, and technological restrictions. In this scenario, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) spectroscopy offers an exceptional opportunity for the development of new sensing devices amenable to implementation of quantitative multiplex analysis in real time. 6 The application of nanostructured materials toward the development of novel detection techniques with improved sensitivity and/or simplified and faster applicability has rapidly become an appealing alternative to other technologies. Among them, SERS is a powerful analytical technique that has already proven to be particularly effective in environmental detection and monitoring applications. Essentially, SERS can be described as the Raman scattering amplified by the presence of a plasmonic structure in close vicinity to the target analyte. In such a case, the main cause of the excitation of vibrational levels of the molecule is the collective oscillation of conduction electrons of the metal upon excitation with the appropriate light. This generates an ultrastrong electromagnetic near-field in the proximity of the nanostructure surface (known as localized surface plasmon resonances). As Raman scattering, SERS provides a complex spectral pattern that contains all the compositional and structural characteristics of the molecule under study. 7 SERS, as Raman, is also characterized by extreme experimental flexibility, as Raman measurements can be carried out over a wide spectral range, are insensitive to air and water, and require no sample preparation.",

This successfully translated the outstanding analytical potential of SERS to reliable, widely accepted, and commercially viable sensing applications. The dependence of localized surface plasmon resonances on parameters, such as size, shape, composition, and surrounding medium, provides multiple possibilities for tuning the optical response and, thus, optimizing the SERS performance of the plasmonic nanostructure for a specific application. In conjunction with the control of the signal amplification provided by the optical enhancer, a key step in the practical implementation of sensing applications (including SERS) is the appropriate chemical functionalization of the \"bare\" metallic surface. This step is necessary to impart the required selectivity and/or sensitivity toward the target analyte, especially in complex mediums. Two design approaches are commonly used to devise plasmonic nanostructures as SERS sensing platforms: (1) direct SERS and (2) encoded particles. In direct SERS, the detection is achieved by directly acquiring the SERS spectrum of the analyte. However, when performing direct SERS, several other species besides the target molecules can be detected simultaneously, thus hampering the application of this strategy when complex analytical matrixes are involved, such as those in biological or environmental applications. In fact, when the number of targets and background species is high, the overlapping of vibrational modes of different molecules is very likely, hence making the interpretation of the overall vibrational spectrum extremely difficult or nearly impossible. On the other hand, SERS-encoded particles can be typically prepared by using an efficient plasmonic substrate that is labeled with a SERS molecule, protected with an external inert layer, and functionalized with the appropriate selective chemoreceptor [such as an antibody (Ab) or an aptamer]. In this case, the identification and quantification of the analyte are indirectly correlated to the presence and intensity of the specific SERS label.",

            "text": "Regarding the optical substrate, SERS has been mainly obtained in nanostructured thin films and colloidal nanoparticles. [8] [9] [10] Colloidal nanoparticles are advantageous for many reasons. Their versatility and ease of synthesis with a high degree of control over the composition, shape, and size, make them by far, the most commonly used substrates in SERS. Through careful control of these three key factors (composition, size, and shape), the optical and plasmonic properties can be tuned to maximize the SERS enhancement. 11 The composition of the metallic nanoparticles deeply affects the intensity of the SERS signal. In this respect, the most important SERS platforms so far have been made of silver and gold, 12 while research using other materials (such as Cu, Pd, Pt, Rh, CuTe, Si, etc.) 13 is still marginal. In general, it can be stated that silver is a much more efficient optical material than gold, giving rise to SERS signals over 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of gold, as silver scattering contribution is larger than that of gold. 14 Additionally, silver can be excited with radiation ranging from UV to IR, while gold is restricted to the red or IR spectrum owing to damping by the interband transitions. As a consequence, silver nanoparticles are preferred when dealing with practical applications. However, it is worth noting that gold nanoparticles not only permit a better control of particle size and shape, but are also significantly more stable and biocompatible. [15] [16] [17] Currently many methods are available for obtaining colloids with high SERS activity, but this topic continues to be a booming research field. Within the limits of wet chemistry, colloidal methods can be divided in a variety of processes, including chemical reduction, laser ablation, or photoreduction, the first one being the most commonly used. 11, 18 The chemical reduction usually comprises a metallic salt (precursor), which is reduced by a chemical agent to produce colloidal dispersions that contain particles of different sizes and variable shapes. Regarding the synthesis of silver nanoparticles, tuning of the size and shape properties is much more difficult to achieve than in the case of gold due to higher reactivity of silver, which limits the extent of control that can be exerted over the selective growth at different crystal facets. 19 However, many synthetic processes have been described to obtain differently sized and shaped nanoparticles, including seed-mediated, polyol, biological, hydro/ solvothermal, galvanic replacement, photochemical, electrochemical, or templatemediated synthesis, [20] [21] [22] [23] which give rise to highly monodisperse colloids in shape and size. Among these methods, the seed-mediated growth process is the most widely used when dealing with shape-controlled nanoparticle synthesis. This protocol includes a two-step process in which the first step consists of the generation of very small spherical particles. In the second step, the particles grow anisotropically in a different direction due to the reduction of metal salts on the surface of the initial seed nanoparticles. The presence of preformed seeds is highly advantageous, as the particle size distribution becomes significantly narrower. The control of experimental variables, such as the concentration of the metal salt, reducing agent, growth speed, temperature, capping agent, or chosen solvent, provides a broad range of differently sized and shaped nanoparticles (Fig. 1.3.3) . 18, 24 Besides the simplicity of the synthetic methods, \"as-prepared\" metal nanoparticles present remarkable advantages when dealing with diagnostic systems in biofluids, as they permit direct SERS analysis within the analyte natural solution medium; they present a large surface area and good dispersion in liquids that allows for a close ",

Direct SERS spectra of microorganism usually show common spectral patterns, especially when studying closely related species. Additionally, if the goal of the method is the determination of the microorganism directly in the biological matrix, the chemical species present will overlap the microorganism SERS spectra, making the interpretation of the result impossible. Thus, as an alternative, SERS can be used as a labeling method in a similar way as fluorophores are used in immunology bioassays. 29 Although fluorescence is powerful and convenient, the lack of features in the obtained spectra (usually composed of just one broad feature) limits the number of analytes that can be recognized with certainty. Thus, the use of SERS as an encoding alternative is rapidly gaining relevance not only due to its unprecedented detection limits that dramatically decrease the detection times, but also owing to the practically unlimited number of barcodes that can be used for simultaneous detection.",

            "text": "The fabrication and characteristics (such as material, size, biocompatibility, and others) of the desired SERS-encoded particles strongly depend on each specific application. However, all of them share some common requirements: (1) presence of an optical enhancer (i.e., the plasmonic nanomaterial), (2) addition of a SERS code, and (3) protection with a silica or polymer layer to prevent leaching of the SERS reporter, while providing a suitable surface for biofunctionalization 30 and colloidal stability ( Fig. 1.3.4) . The first reported works using SERS-encoded particles for multiplex determination relied either on the addition of a SERS tag directly onto the plasmonic particles or on the precoupling of the tag to the biomolecular interface. 31 Nowadays, the preparation of SERS-encoded particles is becoming more exotic. The simplest way to produce SERS-encoded nanoparticles comprises the SERS codification of single spherical plasmonic colloids and encapsulation within silica or polymer shells. [32] [33] [34] On the other hand, silica coating of nanoparticles is also a mature technology. 35 Thus, the key step for the codification of single nanoparticles relies on the incorporation of the Raman label to give rise to a signal as strong as possible without compromising colloidal stability. The formation of the protective shell around the single colloidal particle inhibits plasmon coupling and, in turn, the generation of hot spots (specific gaps between particles where the electromagnetic field is extremely high due to coupling between their plasmon resonances 36, 37 ). Even though the recent demonstration of the heterogeneous distribution of plasmon modes within anisotropic particles 38, 39 is leading to the development of highly active nanoparticles such as nanostars or lace nanoshells 40, 41 (Fig. 1.3.4) , still the most popular approach for the fabrication of nanometer-sized SERS-encoded particles is the use of nanoparticle aggregates as plasmonic cores. Particle aggregation can be easily promoted by changing the solvent, increasing the ionic strength of the suspension, 42 or just spontaneously due to the adsorption of the Raman label. 43 Notwithstanding, these uncontrollable aggregation processes are usually undesired because they lead to a random distribution of hot spots with subsequent signal heterogeneity from cluster to cluster. Thus, several approaches were developed toward controlling aggregation. One of the oldest and probably most successful approaches comprises the so-called composite organic-inorganic nanoparticles (COIN). [44] [45] [46] The COIN approach consists of controlled label-induced aggregation of silver particles. An external shell of bovine serum albumin (BSA) is spontaneously retained onto the COIN; it not only protects the code, but also allows for further functionalization with biomolecules, such as proteins (antibodies). Other strategies for the generation of aggregated encoded particles relies on the induction of aggregation by an increase in the ionic strength, followed by a silica coating of silver or gold colloids. 47, 48 In fact, these particles have recently been demonstrated to give rise to a sufficiently intense signal to enable individually identification in a Raman flow cytometer. 49 Nevertheless, both methods still yield uncontrollable aggregates with ensuing fluctuations in their SERS intensities. For this reason, an increasing activity is observed for the development of controlled methods for the fabrication of SERS active dimers, including spheres, cages, pyramids, or even rods [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] (Fig. 1.3.4 ).",

Nonetheless, the final spectral profile has shown to be extremely sensitive to several experimental factors, such as colloidal properties and sample preparation. 59 In particular, the rather nonhomogeneous distribution of the nanoparticles onto the bacterial walls significantly limits the spectral reproducibility and hampers any quantitative estimation of the target concentration. Several new approaches were developed to solve this problem, with a reduction in the bacterial concentration required to achieve a detectable signal. For instance, magnetic-plasmonic core-shell nanoparticles were used in place of traditional colloids to enable a high concentration of bacteria by applying an external point magnetic field. As a result, a large number of microorganisms and nanoparticles can be effectively condensed into a highly compact dot (Fig. 1.3.6A) . 63 On the other hand, Szymborski et al. 64 combined periodic structures of nanosized fibers with nanostructured gold layers to be used as a dual-efficient SERS filter for the immobilization of bacteria from solutions, such as blood, urine, water, or milk ( Fig. 1.3.6B) .",

Profiting from the high binding affinity of bacteria toward Van, a 1000-fold increase in bacteria capture from biofluids (saliva, phlegm, or blood) was achieved without the introduction of significant spectral interference (Fig. 1.3.6C) . Van-coated SERS substrates acted both as a bacteria-capturing tool and an efficient sensing 65 platform for the identification of SERS fingerprints of the targeted bacteria. The authors reported a concentration of 30% of Enterococcus was present in 1 mL o water (10 2 cfu/mL) that was added onto a microscopic Van-coated area of 707.14 \u00b5m 2 (30-\u00b5m diameter). This microscopic localization helps to reduce the laborious procedure required to locate the bacteria on the substrate and therefore facilitate their subsequent sensing by SERS.",

Such an approach drastically reduced the acquisition time, while improving spectral reproducibility through the analysis of the sample in suspension. Initially, the authors demonstrated the efficiency of this SERS microfluidic device in the classification of nine different precultivated Escherichia coli strains (buffered solutions, ca. 8 \u00d7 10 7 cells/mL). 66 Subsequently, six different species of precultivated mycobacteria (buffered solutions, concentration range from ca. 4 to 40 \u00d7 10 7 cells/mL) were successfully identified. 71 In this latter work, a bead-beating module for the disruption of the bacterial cells was combined with the microfluidic device ( Fig. 1.3.7B) , leading to an automated closed system for sample preparation and measurement. Disruption of the bacterial membrane allows the colloidal silver nanoparticles to interact with all cell components rather that the bacterial walls alone. As a result, richer spectral information is available in the SERS spectra, thus improving the overall discrimination capabilities via chemometric methods.",

Further, additional steps to record a suitable signal for identification are often required. Recently, our group reported the fabrication of a novel microorganism optical detection system (MODS, Fig. 1.3.9A) for the real-time, multiplexed pathogen identification and quantification (down to the single colony-forming unit detection) through fast screening of large body fluid volumes (10 min/mL of blood) as required by standard medical practice for the analysis of biological samples. 77 As for previous sensing schemes, mixing of bacteria-containing fluids with antibody-functionalized SERS-encoded silver nanoparticles induced the accumulation of the particles at the bacterial membrane. In our case, however, SERS-encoded particles were designed so as to yield, upon adhesion onto the bacteria walls, a dense array of interparticle gaps in which the Raman signal is exponentially amplified by several orders of magnitude relative to the dispersed particles. Incubation time was optimized to maximize the nanoparticle coating up to the saturation point (\u223c60%), while avoiding the unwanted flocculation of bacteria overloaded with nanoparticles ( Fig. 1.3.9B) . Under this scenario, the sample can be directly pumped through a millifluidic channel where a backscattered detecting laser continuously monitors the liquid stream, therefore removing the need of time-consuming centrifugation/washing cycles prior to the SERS analysis. In fact, positive events associated with a nanoparticle-coated colony-forming unit traversing the laser focus generate SERS intensities well above the background of dispersed encoded nanoparticles. For a demonstration of bacteria detection, we successfully and simultaneously quantified three different types of bacteria (S. aureus, E. coli, and Streptococcus agalactiae) at a rate of 13 min/mL of blood or serum ( Fig. 1.3 .9C) and at concentrations ranging from units to tens of colony-forming unit per milliliter. Notably, no false identifications were observed in any of the analyses or positive events recorded from blank samples. All of the obtained concentrations were consistent with those found using conventional bacterial culture, but with a considerably lower standard deviation (Fig. 1.3.9C) .",

In the last years, a new family of biomolecules (aptamers) has been developed as an efficient alternative to antibodies. Aptamers display similar or even larger target specificities, 79, 80 while providing key advantages in terms of stability, immunogenicity, facility of production, functionalization, and reduced size. To address this point, we recently extended the use of MODS for online SERS quantification of bacteria in different human fluids (urine, blood, or pleural and ascites fluids infected with very low concentration of S. aureus) using aptamer-functionalized SERS-encoded nanoparticles. 81 In this work, we extensively characterized the efficiency of different biofunctionalized SERS-encoded particles, demonstrating the important advantages of using aptamers over antibodies as biorecognition elements. First, aptamers exhibit much larger affinity for bacteria than antibodies. Second, the final SERS intensity registered for aptamers (at nanoparticle saturation) is around 40% larger than that for antibodies. This can be explained by considering that antibody conjugation onto nanoparticle surfaces results in a random orientation, where a fraction of those attached antibodies experience an inactivation of their binding sites (i.e., paratope). 82 Conversely, aptamers can be easily functionalized/modified without any loss of their activity and, then, their conjugation on the nanoparticle surface can be directed to yield a conformation suitable for their efficient interaction with the target entity. Furthermore, the smaller size of aptamers reduces the interparticle gaps at the bacterial surface, leading to an overall increase of the electromagnetic energy generated at the hot spot.",

Measuring radiation from radioactive tracers attached to NPs has been demonstrated to be a highly sensitive and specific method that allows accurate quantification, without limits to tissue penetration in any organ.

The indirect chelator-mediated 99m Tc-labeling of NPs has been applied to a variety of NP structures. 14 Helbok et al. performed efficient radiolabeling of PEGylated cholesterol liposomes and micelles via an acyclic diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelator. 15 Also, poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) liposomes can be labeled relatively easily and stably with 99m Tc after liposome synthesis, using a procedure which includes the conjugation of 99m Tc to hexamethyl propyleneamine (HMPAO) 16 or hydrazino nicotinamide (HYNIC) 17 followed by their encapsulation into liposomes. The HYNIC-based method provides 99m Tc-labeled liposomes with a high labeling yield (>95%) and improved in vitro and in vivo characteristics compared to the liposomes labeled via 99m Tc-HMPAO. Chitosan (Ch) hydrogel NPs loaded with a vascular endothelial growth factor (a potent angiogenic factor) were efficiently labeled with 99m Tc via a DTPA chelator. The quantitative imaging with 99m Tc-Ch NPs has been demonstrated to be a valuable strategy that can be combined with an angiogenic therapy to customize the treatment of myocardial ischemia. 18 Mercapto acetyl triglycine (MAG3) has been applied to facilitate radiolabeling of morpholinos. 19 meso-2,3-Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) is also a suitable ligand that forms complex compounds with 99m Tc, 186/188 Re, 166 Ho, 177 Lu, and 90 Y. DMSA enables bidentate binding via two sulfur atoms on silver nanoclusters ( Fig. 1.4.4) and additional radiolabeling is possible via the binding of radiometals to DMSA. 20 In some chelating systems it is possible to apply a theranostic approach by substituting the diagnostic radionuclide with a therapeutic one, whereas the chelator and the nanodimensional structure remain. Due to the similar chemical properties of 99m Tc for 188 Re, the labeling procedure is based on the similar complexation chemistries of two radionuclides with the same vector.",

Accordingly, they have a high potential in cerebral perfusion imaging. 21 Iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) may be labeled with a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic radionuclides via direct and indirect, chelator-based radiolabeling techniques. The 99m Tc-labeled aminosilane-coated IONPs may be promising candidates for guided cancer diagnosis and magnetic hyperthermia therapy.

The coupling of 111 In to NPs can be achieved by chelating molecules, such as DTPA or 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA), which are conjugated to the polymers as in the case of 111 In-DTPA-PEG-b-PCL micelles. PEG is an artificial but biocompatible hydrophilic polymer that has been widely applied for NP coating. The radiotracer method has been used to prove that it is possible to use PEG derivatives as tumor-imaging carriers. After 111 In labeling via DTPA, in vivo biodistribution studies demonstrated an increased tumor uptake and a prolonged circulation half-life with the increase in the molecular weight of PEG. 24 NPs that degrade and radionuclides that detach or are released from the NPs can cause artifacts. Dual radiolabeling using \u03b3-emitters with different energy spectra incorporated into the core and coating may be used as a general methodology for a wide range of engineered NPs for the visualization of the degradation process of NPs in vivo. To label the core, 111 In-doped IONPs were encapsulated inside poly(lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (PLGA NPs) during the preparation. The bovine serum albumin (BSA) coating was labeled by electrophilic substitution using 125 I. Imaging revealed different fates for the core and coating, with a fraction of the two radionuclides colocalizing in the liver and lungs for long periods of time after administration, suggesting that NPs are stable in these organs. 25 The conjugation of chelating agents to NPs could affect their biodistribution. The attachment of such a chelate could alter the corona of the micelles and, consequently, their biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. Similarly to other radionuclides, 111 In may also be entrapped in the micellar core during the formation of micelles without the need for any chemical modification. 26 Polymeric micelles (lactosome) were labeled via DOTA with 111 In and 90 Y for SPECT imaging and radiotherapy, respectively. Biodistribution studies revealed that 111 In-DOTA-lactosome was selectively accumulated in the tumor site of mice due to the EPR effect. The observed antitumor therapeutic effect of 90 Y-DOTA-lactosome depended on the dose frequency and amount. 27 ",

HApNPs were modified with aminopropyltriethoxysilane to introduce amino groups on the surface of HAp for effective radioiodination. 32 Labeling without any modification achieved by adding the oxidizing agent chloramine T in situ during the formation of HAp resulted in the reproducible high labeling yield of 125 I-labeled HAp. 33 34 PET is a more recent development in medicine, and it uses radionuclides produced in a cyclotron. A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator in which charged particles accelerate outward from the center along a spiral path. Limitations to the widespread use of PET arise from the high costs of cyclotrons needed to produce the shortlived radionuclides for PET scanning, the need for a specially adapted on-site chemical synthesis apparatus for radiolabeling, and a PET imaging facility in close proximity to the cyclotron due to the short half-life of most positron-emitting radionuclides. Furthermore, liposomes and some other NPs are the products of multiple steps that require a much longer process related to the half-lives of commonly used positron emitter nuclei. Thus, labeling methods in which components of liposome or preformulated drugs are substituted with short-lived positron-emitting radionuclides are impractical.",

            "text": "Urakami et al. 35 developed a rapid and efficient labeling method for lipid NPs via 1-[ 18 F]fluoro-3,6-dioxatetracosane without changing their physiological properties. Dynamic PET scanning showed that liposome-encapsulated hemoglobin delivers oxygen even into the ischemic region from the periphery toward the core of ischemia. (38) :385102. 31 In recent years, the use of PET isotopes with a relatively long half-life ( 64 Cu, 89 Zr and 68 Ga) has been increased. These metals can be coupled in a straightforward fashion using chelators, such as DTPA, DOTA, 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA), 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-\u2032 \u2032\u2032 \u2032\u2032\u2032  N N N N , , , -tetraacetic acid (TETA), and derivatives of these macrocyclic chelating agents. Originally, DOTA was designed for lanthanides (e.g., Gd 3+ ), but it can be used for a wide range of radiometals as well. As DOTA has four carboxylic functions on the side chains of the macrocycle-bearing four nitrogens, the binding of 64 Cu leads to deformed octahedral complexation of the Cu 2+ ion, thereby leaving two of the acidic functions free. Accordingly, one is available for the coupling to NPs or polymers and the other allows further derivatization, or acts as an additional hydrophilic group. The review of Stockhofe et al. 8 presents a comprehensive study on various approaches and methods for the labeling of potential drug delivery systems using positron emitters. 64 Cu has favorable decay characteristics, (\u03b2 + : 0.653 MeV, 17.4%; \u03b2 -: 0.578 MeV, 39%) for both PET and radiotherapy. Due to a half-life of 12.7 h, it has been shown to be very effective for assessing the behavior of nanomaterials in vivo for prolonged times. The functionalization of PMMA-core/PEG-shell NPs with a DOTA ligand allowed for the chelation of 64 Cu and enabled the investigation of the biodistribution of these materials in correlation to the molecular weight of the backbone and the PEG grafts. 36 The method for 64 Cu labeling via NOTA as the chelator was developed in the case of cRGD-functionalized and doxorubicin-conjugated IONPs for potential application in drug delivery and PET/MRI dual-modality imaging. 37 Also, the application of an improved 64 Cu-labeling procedure via a novel amine-activated chelator [2-p-(3-aminopropylthioureido)benzyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-tetraacetic acid (amine-Bz-DOTA)] conjugated to the surface of dextran sulfate-coated IONPs, enabled to avoid cross-linking of IONPs (which caused NP aggregation) and obtain a higher labeling yield. 38 Additional binding of tumor-specific antibodies to 64 Culabeled doxorubicin-loaded silica-based NPs provided an increased accumulation at the tumor site via an enhanced permeability, the retention effect, and antibodymediated binding to tumor. 8 The use of 68 Ga (positron emission intensity 87%) is on the rise due to several identifiable properties of this radionuclide. These include a superior image quality to that provided by SPECT radionuclides and the potential for on-demand production via a generator ( 68 Ge/ 68 Ga-generator). 39 Successful 68 Ga labeling requires a chelating agent and so far, DOTA and NOTA chelators have been used to radiolabel organic and inorganic nanodimensional systems with 68 Ga cation. Polyamidoamine dendrimer (PAMAM) was conjugated successfully with bifunctional chelate N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of DOTA, and the subsequent radiolabeling with 68 Ga was achieved with a high radiolabeling yield and stability. However, DOTA-like macrocycles are not the best ligands for Ga 3+ , as the incorporation of ions inside the macrocyclic cavity leads to severe distortion of the coordination octahedra around the Ga 3+ ions. NOTA-like ligands with a bis(phosphonate)-containing side arm (as the bone-targeting group) connected to a metal-binding cage through acetamide or methylphosphonate pendant arms (NOTAM BP and NO2AP BP ) have been shown as highly potent chelators for small 68 Ga 3+ ions. 40 Synthetic apatite nanocrystals have demonstrated an excellent ability to bind two PET radionuclides, 18 F and 68 Ga, with a good in vitro stability. Na 18 F was used for the direct incorporation of the radionuclide into the crystal lattice, while the labeling by surface functionalization was accomplished by using 68 GaNO2AP BP .",

            "text": "Currently, radionuclide therapy remains an important treatment option. The ionizing radiation from radionuclides can kill cells or inhibit the growth in the periphery and the inaccessible centers of cancerous lesions. The sites of damage comprise all cellular levels, especially DNA in the nucleus of cells. 41 Internal radiotherapy relies on the implantation of radioactive seeds, such as radiolabeled microparticles and NPs, delivering highly localized doses to a diseased area. Due to the inhomogeneous distribution of radiolabeled particles, especially within large tumors with a necrotic center, long-range \u03b2-emitters with lower linear energy transfers and greater annihilation distances of several cells (typically 0.2-12 mm) provide a larger and tortuous radioactive dose volume. Yttrium-90 ( 90 Y), lutetium-177 ( 177 Lu), and rhenium-188 ( 188 Re) are proposed as suitable candidates for the internal radionuclide therapy, especially of primary and metastatic malignancies, while \u03b1and Auger-emitters, due to their short range in tissues, would be more appropriate for the effective killing of circulating cells with a minimal irradiation of the blood. 42 No more than a few studies were conducted with \u03b1-emitting radionuclides, such as 225 Ac (half-life 10 days), which were mostly attached through chelation. 43 90 Y is a high-energy \u03b2-emitter with optimal nuclear physical characteristics (half-life 64.1 h, E max = 2.27 MeV) for radionuclide therapy. It can affect tumor cells up to a maximum depth of 11 mm in the soft tissue. This is described by the cross fire effect occurring due to the long path of \u03b2-particles that crosses multiple individual cells, decreasing the need for targeting each cancer cell with the radiopharmaceutical. Radiolabeled NPs, such as 90 Y-silicate/citrate colloid and 186 Re-sulfur colloid, have been used for radiosynovectomy with very encouraging results, especially in Europe. 44 The method is based on the local intraarticular injection of nanoparticulates/ colloids labeled with suitable therapeutic radionuclides into a diseased joint, where they are phagocytized by the macrophages of the inflamed synovial membrane delivering a selective radiation dose to the synovium. 90 Y-labeled colloid NPs, such as antimony trisulfide colloid (Sb 2 S 3 ) 45 and tin fluoride colloid (SnF-c) 46 have a potential application in radiosinevactomy. 47 SnF-c particles were 90 Y labeled by the addition of 90 YCl 3 before the formation of primary particles (nucleation) and particle growth. These particles first aggregate and finally agglomerate due to the increased temperature, agitation, and aging (schematically represented in Fig. 1.4.7) .The particle size of 90 Y-SnF-c for different therapeutic applications is controlled by manipulating the conditions under which the colloids form.",

Therefore, the labeling resulted in a very high labeling yield (99%) and good in vitro and in vivo stability. Due to the significant uptake of 90 Y-Fe 3 O 4 -PEG600 NPs in liver and their low uptake by other tissues, magnetite NPs labeled with \u03b2-emitters could be suitable for use in the combined radiotherapy-hyperthermia cancer treatment. Magnetic NPs coated with proteins, such as human serum albumin (HSA), were also effectively 90 Y labeled by the direct approach, without any further surface chemical modification. 56 The indirect 90 Y labeling of NPs is possible via different ligands [2,3-dicarboxypropane-1,1-diphosphonic acid (DPD) (Fig. 1.4.8) 57 and DMSA], which are capable of forming stable complexes with 90 Y. 177 Lu (half-life 6.7 days) is the ideal \u03b2 \u2212 radionuclide for theranosis, as it has a particulate emission (\u03b2 \u2212 or Auger electron) for effecting therapy and emits several accompanying \u03b3-photons of 208 keV (11%) and 113 keV (6.4%), which are used for diagnostic evaluation and dosimetry. 58 The advantage of the long half-life of 177 Lu has been utilized in mapping the pharmacokinetics of potential agents, in radiosynovectomy of knee joints, and the therapy of hepatocellular carcinoma. Several studies 46 were conducted with 177 Lu-labeled AuNPs for imaging and therapy in tumor-bearing mice. AuNPs modified with PEG chains linked to DOTA made complex compounds with 177 Lu. Gold nanoseeds injected intratumorally were highly effective for inhibiting the growth of breast cancer tumors in CD-1 athymic mice and caused no normal organ toxicity. 59 Targeting with 177 Lu-AuNPs conjugated to RGD peptide showed a higher delivery into the tumor site than non-RGD and 177 Lu-RGD controls, highlighting the potential therapeutic capacity of radiolabeled NPs for endoradiotherapy. 60 Based on the previous work, where 68 Ga-labeled DOTA-conjugated bisphosphonates were investigated as PET-imaging agents, a few DOTA-based bisphosphonates were synthesized and labeled with 177 Lu for potential application in treating metastatic bone tumors. 61 ",

Macrophage-derived exosome-mimetic nanovesicles were labeled with 99m Tc and their distribution was analyzed using the SPECT/CT technique in vivo. The results enabled the determination of the highest accumulation of 99m Tc-exosome-mimetic nanovesicles in the liver. 65 The biodistribution of PLGA NPs with and without encapsulated ascorbic acid in healthy rats was examined after their direct labeling with 99m Tc, which binds outside, on the surface of NPs. 66 The investigated nanospheres exhibit a prolonged blood circulation time accompanied with a time-dependent reduction in the lungs, liver, and spleen. This is a quick and convenient method to investigate the pharmacological behavior of a new nanoparticulate system for controlled and systemic drug delivery with a double effect. 67, 68 In such a system, it is of utmost importance to study the release of drugs from bioresorbable polymers and, in the second stage, after the resorption of the polymer, to investigate the potential of nonbioresorbable calcium phosphate as a filler in a bone defect. The surface properties of PLGA/HAp coreshell NPs loaded with clindamycin and their changes under the simulated physiological conditions during the degradation process could also be investigated using a radiotracer method. 69 Radiolabeled nanomaterials based on graphene, including graphene, graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene quantum dots (GQDs), and their derivatives indicate their high potential as imaging agents in a variety of bioimaging applications, especially in PET/SPECT. 70 111 In-mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) proved to be suitable for the tracking of neural stem cells in glioblastoma therapies. Multimodal dynamic in vivo imaging of NSCs behavior in the brain is an important parameter in the design of a controlled, targeted, and successful therapy. MSNs were labeled with 111 In using DOTA-NHS-ester through amide formation. SPECT confirmed the ability of 111 In-MSN-NSCs to penetrate through the bloodbrain barrier and their localization in tumor cells. 71 Multimodality imaging by taking advantage of two or more imaging modalities can provide structural, functional, and molecular information of importance for the diagnosis and treatment. 72 It is possible to couple, for example, magnetic resonance (MR)-active NPs to a chelating system, thereby enabling in vivo tracking by multimodal imaging techniques (e.g., SPECT/MRI, PET/MRI). The synthesized core/shell NPs of Co 0.16 Fe 2.84 O 4 @NaYF 4 (Yb, Er) and Fe 3 O 4 @NaYF 4 (Yb, Tm) were stabilized with bisphosphonate polyethylene glycol conjugates (BP-PEG) and radiolabeled with 18 F or 64 Cu and 99m Tc. The fabricated particles have shown the advanced features and the possibility of application in the trimodal imaging (MRI, PET/SPECT, and fluorescent imaging). A high colloidal stability and a narrow size distribution (\u223c10 nm) allow for the potential use of these particles as visual guides during surgery. 73 64 Cu 2+ -labeled natural biopolymer-based multifunctional NPs were successfully used in cancer multimodal [PET/MRI/photoacoustic imaging (PAI)] imaging techniques. 74 \"Dragon fruit-like biocage\" based on apoferritin (APF) was employed ( Fig. 1.4.10) to construct an efficient and excellent biostability nanoplatform [APF:Melanin:Fe 3+ (AMF) AMF] suitable for multimodal clinical application.",

            "text": "Different approaches to the radiolabeling of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) with 14 C were tested to obtain a suitable system that could be used in the analysis of biodistribution. The concept of surface functionalization and formation of a multiple core system made it possible to obtain particles with a hydrodynamic radius smaller than 100 nm. NPs are functionalized with polycarboxylate or polyamine surface functional groups, and 14 C is incorporated directly into the carbon backbone of the organic molecules. This concept makes it possible to obtain identical surface chemical functionality of labeled and nonlabeled particles, enabling an accurate analysis prior to potential clinical applications. 79 NP carrier crown ether-conjugated silica (SiNPs) is radiolabeled with 22 Na with a loading efficacy of 98.1% \u00b1 1.4%. Due to the relatively long half-life of 2.6 years, this radionuclide has not had a wider application in biomedicine. However, for these reasons, 22 Na may represent a practical choice in research. The 1-month in vivo study on female BALB/c mice (6-weeks old) showed that 22 Na-SiNPs were removed from the organism after 2 weeks, and completely after a month. The highest accumulation of particles was recorded in the liver, 5 min after intravenous administration. 80 Heatinduced metal ion-binding reaction, which enables radiolabeling without modifying the surface structure, was used for the labeling of paramagnetic IONPs. Feraheme (FH, solution composed of a nonstoichiometric Fe 3 O 4 magnetite core, approximately 5-10 nm in diameter stabilized with a carboxymethyl dextran coating; total size: 17-31 nm diameter) NPs were labeled with 89 Zr in a thermal reaction at 120\u00b0C in less than 60 min. The biodistribution of 89 Zr-FHNPs 96 h after the intravenous injection to mice indicated the uptake of 89 Zr-FH in the lymphatic system. 81 To analyze and interpret the biodistribution of various components of multicomponent and more complex nanosystems the concept of dual radiolabeling of NPs was applied. Citrate-coated AuNPs (monodisperse, 14 nm in diameter) were labeled with 14 C and 198 Au. By using liquid scintillation to determine 14 C and \u03b3-spectroscopy for 198 Au, different biodistribution profiles were determined for the Au core and the citrate surface coating over time. The obtained results of biodistribution show that over time the delamination and degradation of the citrate coating of NPs occur. 82 PLGA-coated IONPs were labeled with two \u03b3-emitters 111 In and 125 I (Fig. 1.4.12) , such that during the synthesis Au was labeled with 111 In and PLGA with 125 I. The 25 energy-discriminant SPECT modality was used to analyze each radioisotope independently during the in vivo test with mice (BALB/cJRJ). The results showed that over time, the PLGA surface coating separated from the core, as 125 I was detected in the thyroid glands and urine, and 111 In in the liver. 25 ",

The results showed a higher affinity to bone tissues in contrast to the surrounding muscle tissue. 86 To achieve a more specific targeting, targeted nanoparticles are functionalized with various molecules. Anticancer therapeutic properties of the 125 I-labeled hybrid nanosized cyclic RGD-conjugated AuNPs (cRGD-AuNPs) system were tested (including acute apoptosis 2 days posttreatment and long-term influence up to 21 days). The results confirmed the effective targeting of tumor with 125 I-cRGD-AuNP and the suppression of its growth. 87 It has been demonstrated that the systems based on AuNPs functionalized with an epidermal growth factor as carriers of 111 In are successful in the targeting and therapy of epidermal growth factor receptor-positive cancers. 88 Targeted radiotherapy was also successfully achieved with conjugated surfaces of nanosystems on the basis of BSA nanocapsules, silica, monoclonal antibodies, etc. [89] [90] [91] Multifunctional nanoplatforms for the simultaneous use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy could enable significant progress in the field of nanooncology.

Clear boundaries between objects for diagnostic imaging, therapy, or biodistribution have almost disappeared. The term \"theranostics\" has unified the diagnostic and therapeutic potentials of the system into a single agent to achieve efficient, specific, and individual therapy in various diseases. 94 Gadolinium-doped hydroxyapatite (HAp-Gd) nanorods could be used as theranostic NPs to detect the early stages of osteosarcoma, or as carriers of radioisotopes in therapy. Gadolinium endows HAp with paramagnetic properties, while phosphorous and gadolinium in the HAp-Gd sample can be activated by neutron capture, in a nuclear reactor, producing 32 P and 159 Gd radioisotopes. 95 The multifunctional platform based on single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) coated with a shell of polydopamine (PDA) was modified with PEG. SWNT@PDA-PEG was labeled with 131 I nucleotide, which potentially allows nuclear imaging and cancer therapy. An in vivo study in mice confirmed the accumulation of intravenously administered 131 I-SWNT@PDA-PEG in the tumor tissues. The PDA coating not only allowed an easy labeling with 131 I but also its delivery, due to which the system was able to perform radionuclide therapy as well. 96 A particular research challenge is focused on the preparation of radiolabeled NPs with significant in vivo stability. A detailed analysis of the chelator-free radiolabeling technique indicates the vital importance of deprotonated silanol groups during 89 Zr to obtain long stable systems. The in vivo study of the stability of these systems indicates that the detachment rate of 89 Zr-MSN is about 20 times slower than that of 89 Zr-dSiO 2 . The results obtained with PET modality indicated that the existence of mesochannels within MSN particles is responsible for the high stability of 89 Zr-MSN system over a period of 3 weeks. 97 After the injection of 89 Zr-MSN, their accumulation in the liver and spleen can be perceived, while the bone uptake is not present, which is not the case with 89 Zr-dSiO 2 .",

Upon ejaculation, HIV present in semen or (A) produced in loco by donor HIV-infected leukocytes requires to first cross mucus fluids covering mucosae. Then, viral particles can surpass the epithelial barrier by different pathways: (B) direct access to the lamina propria across gaps in the epithelium, (C) capture and transepithelial transport of virions by Langerhans cells, (D) partial penetration of the epithelium and infection of intraepithelial CD4 + T cells (or other leukocytes) that then migrate to the lamina propria, or (E) epithelial crossing through intercellular spaces or by transcytosis. Once in the lamina propria, (F) HIV can productively infect target cells, such as macrophages, CD4 + T cells, or dendritic cells (DCs). (G) DCs can also mediate transinfection of other target cells, namely CD4 + T cells. Upon initial infection of target cells, (H) local viral amplification occurs mainly in CD4 + T cells before migration of (I) the free virus and/or (J) infected cells to regional lymph nodes. (K) Transfer of HIV to lymph nodes can also be mediated in trans by nonproductively infected DCs. Reprinted from das Neves J, Nunes R, Rodrigues F, Sarmento B.
