Patients with infiltrates on chest X-ray, obvious line or soft-tissue infection, or with pathogens already isolated, should receive targeted therapy as determined by national guidelines not the 'empirical' neutropenic fever regimen. Differentiation between uncomplicated neutropenic fever and life-threatening neutropenic sepsis is not always made and the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Sepsis requires additional rapid interventions and appropriate care bundles for sepsis management. Definition of response to antibiotics is often determined incorrectly by resolution of fever. There is an unrealistic expectation that fever will settle rapidly whereas in reality the duration of fever in documented bacterial infection is 7e10 days. 2 This leads to inappropriate addition and/or switching of antimicrobials. Markers of response should concentrate on clinical variables and include reducing fever haemodynamic stability and normalization of acute phase response markers; response should not be determined solely by rapid defervescence of fever. Historically, immunocompromised patients succumbed to Gramnegative septicaemia but the advent of more active antibiotics, especially antipseudomonal penicillins, combined with the frequent use of long-term intravascular access devices led to a change in the spectrum of organisms in the 1980s with a rise in Gram-positive infection, due particularly to coagulase-negative staphylococci. More recently the pendulum has swung back with the re-emergence of Gram-negative organisms producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases, resulting in infection with multi-resistant organisms.",

It must be remembered that severe infection may present with hypothermia. Monotherapy with extended-spectrum beta-lactam agents has been shown to be equivalent to and less toxic than aminoglycoside combinations in several meta-analyses and is recommended in most guidelines. 4 Concerns regarding these analyses remain, in that they compared different b-lactam agents in different studies and did not take into account the changing spectrum of diseases over time. These concerns have been addressed by a mixed treatment analysis demonstrating a benefit for monotherapy with ureidopenicillins such as piperacillin/ tazobactam (Tazocin \u00d2 ). 3 This treatment was associated with the lowest mortality (although not necessarily infectious mortality) and was not affected by year of study. Empirical use of glycopeptides is now discouraged. However, when deciding on initial empirical therapy, it is most important to consider clinical and microbiological findings. Combination therapy may still be indicated and centres with a high incidence of resistance should undertake a risk assessment. Key NICE recommendations are outlined in Practice points.",

            "text": "Current NICE guidance does not go beyond the initial empirical phase to cover refractory fever. Many problems arise with patients with unresponsive fever where fungal and/or viral infection may be suspected. Empirical antifungal therapy is still considered by many as a standard of care for patients with refractory fever but it inevitably results in massive overuse of costly and potentially toxic antifungal drugs in patients who do not actually have invasive fungal disease. In solid organ transplantation, the incidence of invasive fungal disease (IFD) varies, being lowest in renal transplantation and highest in small bowel transplantation. 5 Most infections are caused by Candida species 6 except in lung transplant patients where aspergillosis causes invasive disease and tracheobronchitis in up to 9% of patients. 7 Liver transplant patients are often considered at high risk of mould infection but the incidence is relatively low (1e9%) unless specific risk factors (re-transplantation, renal failure) are present. In haematology and stem cell transplant patients where azole prophylaxis against Candida is widely used, invasive aspergillosis is the major IFD seen with rates ranging from less than 5 to 15%. 8 Improved radiological techniques and introduction of biomarkers (antigen testing and polymerase chain reaction) have allowed a move away from empirical therapy towards a targeted or pre-emptive approach. 9, 10 Infections associated with defects in cell-mediated immunity In addition to neutropenia, patients undergoing treatment for malignancies are frequently also lymphopenic. It was recognized nearly half a century ago that concomitant lymphopenia doubled the risk of severe infection. 11 Use of immunosuppressants to prevent rejection and graftversus-host disease and increasing use of monoclonal antibody therapies such as rituximab and alemtuzumab (Campath \u00d2 ) have profound and long-lasting effects on CMI. but the range of emerging pathogens including acanthamoebae and algal (prototheca) infections continues to grow. Despite advances in the treatment of HIV disease, pneumocystis infections are increasing and are now seen in groups not previously considered at high risk of this infection. 12 Post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is frequently driven by EpsteineBarr virus (EBV) and is seen following all forms of transplantation. An increase in central nervous system EBV has been reported. Traditional treatment involves removal of immunosuppression, which may mean sacrificing the organ transplant. Other therapies include rituximab and the recent availability of EBV-specific cytotoxic T-cell infusions and the prospect of effective EBV vaccines should improve outcomes. 13 The major burden of invasive fungal disease is now associated with defective CMI and two-thirds of patients with invasive aspergillosis are not neutropenic. 14 Onset is seen around 100 days following stem-cell transplantation (SCT), usually in the context of on-going immunosuppression and immune dysregulation.",
