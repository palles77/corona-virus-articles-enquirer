Extreme case examples of disasters especially vulnerable to these challenges are global pandemics, or disease outbreaks, in which data required for research response are only available after the start of an outbreak. This paper argues the developing field of probabilistic innovation (innovation increasing probability of solving societal problems through radically increasing coordination of volumes of problem-solving inputs and analysis), and its methodologies, such as those drawing from crowdsourced R&D and social media, may offer useful insights into enabling real time research capabilities, with important implications for disaster and crisis management. Three paradigms of disaster research are differentiated, as literature is related to theory offered by post normal science, Kuhnian 'normal science' and Lakatosian 'structural science,' and the goal of achieving real time research problem solving capacity in disaster crisis situations. Global collaborative innovation platforms and large-scale investments in emerging crowdsourced R&D and social media technologies together with synthesis of appropriate theory may contribute to improved real time disaster response and resilience across contexts, particularly in instances where data required to manage response is only available after disasters unfold.",

The rise of crowd-sourcing [30] , defined here as sourcing inputs or resources from the 'crowd' or from an open call to the public, potentially heralds a new paradigm in problem solving; as problem solving data inputs can now be obtained from the general population, or the crowd, on a scale hitherto unimagined. Crowdsourced research and development (R&D) relates specifically to crowd-sourcing which seeks to source information for problem solving research purposes, and expertsourcing is crowd-sourcing for inputs from experts, a form of crowdsourced R&D. Crowdfunding is crowd-sourcing applied to raise funding. A new stream of literature with a focus on real time problem solving, namely 'probabilistic innovation' [10] suggests that by exponentially increasing volumes of problem solving research inputs (expert and non-expert) from millions (in the 'crowd'), radical acceleration of medical research can be enabled, and research yield timelines can be 'crashed,' thus radically accelerating the pace of scientific research. This developing stream of literature, extended to disaster management, arguably offers useful insights for those seeking to build theory around increasing effectiveness of real time crisis management.",

The field of disaster management may be an important 'development ground' for important research into how real time capacity can be attained, and the application of real time probabilistic innovation in the form of crowdsourced R&D [10] to crisis disasters is therefore crucially important. A useful heuristic, then, is the example of such a disaster in the form of a disease outbreak, or pandemic, in which the data needed for research to solve this problem are only available after the start of the outbreak. Disaster management is therefore taken to be an important context for research into how to develop probabilistic innovation theory for the following reasons.",

A core assumption underlying this notion, however, is that exponential increases in crowd inputs can transmit to useful outputs [10] . Given effectiveness of probabilistic innovation hinges on this assumption, knowledge of how to operationalise probabilistic innovation is however lacking, and research has a long way to go before radical acceleration of time scales in 'conventional' medical research (such as research into cancer, diabetes or ageing) becomes a reality. Hence, the extreme conditions of disasters can provide a useful testing ground for theory relating crowdsourced R&D and social media technologies contributions to data collection, integration and analysis, as the potential value contributions of probabilistic innovation are more immediately evident and clear under disaster conditions. Process innovations associated with probabilistic innovation are taken to derive from management theory generally, and knowledge management theory more specifically.",

Next, having laid groundwork for a justification of arguments made, a model is derived, which seeks to offer a classification of disaster literature according to three paradigms corresponding to types of science, termed 'post normal' science [22] , Kuhnian 'normal' science [34] and Lakatosian [35] 'structural science.' Linking disaster literature to a focus on real time problem solving and research capability and to these three bodies of theory, this paper seeks to enable further theory building to better contribute to disaster problem solving and research.

Specific disasters are the \"product of complex conditions, in both the environmental and social realms\" and response dependent on complex interactions of institutional response and environmental conditions [25] . Closely related to complexity theory applied to disaster management is the need to manage information and knowledge in contexts of extreme complexity, and the need to understand causal mechanisms and channels as well as to develop theory that guides the management of knowledge inputs under extreme conditions.",

Statistical models have been used to model risk and variability, for example in cases of tornado risk [47] , reflecting an increasing trend toward modelling information in crisis response. This process of modelling different dimensions of crisis and response, however, is dependent on both volume and quality of data collection and analysis. Mapping of hard and soft system infrastructure, at both the micro and macro levels, and developing models of these relationships is important, yet has typically been under-researched [43] .

The development of collaborative web-based geographic information systems frameworks [3] and other internet-based collaboration technologies can now leverage social interactions on online platforms, and between members of online communities as well as firms; an example is the use of crowd-sourcing to source t-shirt artwork using contest formats with monetary rewards in addition to crowd engagement at different stages (such as ideation, development and launch) of the innovation process [58] . Event monitoring technologies [20] can also be merged with internet technologies to facilitate real time disaster response and problem solving. Collaboration technologies can provide important infrastructure to support real time response, but also longer term disaster response. However, real time response payoffs can be substantial, as disaster consequences met with adequate immediate response can maximise effectiveness of response.",

Tweets, hashtags, tagged images, and experiences of those involved are accumulated, which offers certain useful information, such as where the damage is most intense and more information, and volunteers provided crowd-sourced checking of tags and keywords for priority, a process particularly important in contexts where information overload is a dominant problem [16] . Social media therefore also supports ad-hoc network formation, linking people with different functions, expertise and contexts, as media becomes an artefact \"around which knowledge is organised in clusters, such as comments on blog posts or tags on images\" ([59]:7).

A useful analogy, perhaps, is that of an airport, which has a certain capacity for aircraft to take off and land. If this represents the amount of ideas that can be managed by the probabilistic innovation system, then the goal would be to increase these volumes exponentially; to 'take off and land' millions of ideas off a single platform. This might seem intuitively impossible, but given a radical innovation of the crowdsourced R&D platform, this might one day be possible.

In a global context of integrated disaster management logistics, and integration of work by civilian, government and military networks [50] , as well as increasingly networked collaborations between institutional and individual stakeholders in disaster management, theory development with a focus on managing boundaries is perhaps of growing importance. Knowledge flows across different kinds of boundaries is an important area of future probabilistic innovation research. However, it is important not to lose sight of the emergence of a range of different sub-fields within the disaster literature, and provide a synthesis of these. Given the multidisciplinary nature of disaster research, a mapping these sub-fields is necessary. An example of such as field is disaster operations management.",

The need for global outbreak response networks is increasingly salient in a context of potential species crossovers.

The core thesis of this paper is that given the potential consequences of catastrophic disasters, there are consequences associated with not developing focus on disaster research theory and best practice drawing on the principles of probabilistic innovation. Arguably, the congestion, complexity and uncertainties of disaster knowledge management require high volume idea inputs to solve problems in addition to knowledge and information inputs, and developing the field of probabilistic innovation with a special focus on managing these inputs in a way akin to 'high volume air traffic control' might ultimately offer the hope of real time research problem solving. Radical acceleration of biomedical research and other social problem solving research, including climate change and other disaster management applications may be possible if crowdsourced R&D lives up to the promise suggested by probabilistic innovation theory.",

This process naturally fits with real time disaster management, as in certain crises an enormous amount of data needs to be sourced, managed, and subjected to an integrated analysis in an instantaneous process. It is not the place here, however, to deepen discussions on ontological and epistemological characteristics of probabilistic innovation; the objective here is instead to offer a differentiation of categorisation of disaster theory and literature, in the hope future theory building can unite appropriate and useful streams of literature in support of real time problem solving (the real time response paradigm discussed here).",

Theory relating to this paradigm relevant to constraints to scientific advances might best be likened to conditions described in Kuhn's [34] analysis of paradigms and resistance of scientists themselves to scientific progress, in that work is conducted within paradigms, and paradigms are not themselves questioned.

Key to problem solving at the resource response stage is the ability to channel volumes of resources.

Whereas the resource response paradigm relates to work within Kuhnian paradigms, where evidence is accumulated with the potential for it to accumulate and overthrow a paradigm [34] , the structural potential paradigm is taken to reflect dominance of core tenets of scientific fields, which as described by Lakatos [35] defy paradigmatic change in that core theoretical tenets are immune to evidence suggesting change. This body of theory offers a perspective of the long term structure of scientific fields which are taken here to be classifiable in terms of their slow response potential to disasters. Market structure and incentive constraints are also perhaps associated with this paradigm, as innovativeness constrained by market structures (such as profitability challenges associated with pharmaceutical innovation in which returns to R&D are uncertain but high upfront investments are necessary), and the inherent need for profitability which may result in lack of investment in scientific problem solving in the first place for populations (markets) who cannot afford to pay. It is however not the place of this work to consider these issues here, but only to differentiate between these three temporal paradigms of disaster response in a way that is potentially useful, and which highlights potential for disaster management in real time crisis situations to act as a laboratory for developing knowledge about real time problem solving responses.",

Research with the intent of radical change in this type of science relates to radical advances but within established paradigms. Literature dealing with management of crises in real time is considered necessarily outside the ambit of Kuhn's [34] normal science, as radical processes are required in order to create breakthroughs and real time research capability. However, even within this paradigm, there is perhaps a continuum of change intent. Radical change intent, although limited by paradigmatic assumptions, within this paradigm can lead to radical, or revolutionary outcomes [34] , where transcendence of the paradigm can occur. Research within the resource response paradigm therefore has the potential to achieve paradigm transcendence. Arguably, disruption of this paradigm through theory developed in real time response can improve disaster responsiveness in theory development across the spectrum of research.",

Lakatos [35] relates analysis to Newton's theory in physics, and how core theory is fundamentally resistant to change, and new evidence. Within what is considered here Lakatosian science, are streams of literature which can be fundamentally wed to ideology or deep structures which can be at odds with Kuhnian normal science as the paradigm of Lakatosian science might not necessarily be aligned with scientific advances but premised on the maintenance of the field itself over and above scientific progress. In Latakosian fields, radical change intent is taken to be typically concerned with field preservation, and change resistant intent is premised on maintaining the bedrock assumptions of fields in the face of contrarian evidence. Whereas Kuhn's [34] normal science is taken to offer the potential for revolutionary science, or paradigm transcendence, structural science is not. Fig. 3 offers a synthesis of the above analysis, and seeks to make explicit the disruptive influences of social media [1] and crowd-sourcing as crowdsourced R&D or expert problem solving [10, 11] . These are just examples of the new age of technological advances enabling real time disaster response. Although the 'natural laboratory' of disaster crisis management is expected to offer the primary context through which theory development and theory testing can offer insights into the mechanisms through which real time problem solving can be enabled, contagion effects from advances in this literature are considered to transmit to recovery and structural change paradigms.

However, time is needed for this, and this literature can perhaps be more usefully approached as medium-term response. Lessons from how pandemic responses have been triggered by outbreaks, such as vaccine development [19] In wake of 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic, innovation in vaccine development resulted [19] . The implications for disaster management derived from this suggest that if these advances could be spurred prior to outbreaks, benefits could be better captured 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic [19] Lessons derived from this work show how dramatic acceleration in R&D followed in the wake of a disaster. Arguably, if this acceleration can occur prior to disasters, the costs and consequences of disasters can be dramatically reduced. Probabilistic innovation seeks to create a radical acceleration of knowledge creation in real time, prior to disasters. This relates to medium-term response. Shortcomings of traditional knowledge management systems (KMS); disjuncture between these systems and the unique complexity of each disaster where decision making needs to be in real time, and how social media can support ad hoc network formation [59] ; social media in disaster risk reduction [1] Disasters pose emergent challenges and problems, and real time decision making faces the problems of too much versus too little information; serverbased disaster management software such as free open source Sahana Disaster Management System [59] 2010 Haiti earthquake [59] The 'airport congestion' analogy is derived from this literature; how to exponentially increase inputs into problem solving and knowledge management off a platform is akin to increasing the numbers of aircraft using an airport from tens to thousands. This is the key problem faced by probabilistic innovation research. If this problem could be solved, there is little standing in the way of solving biomedical and disaster problems, with applications from disease research to aging research. This problem is considered medium term as theory developed here relates both to real time as well as structural paradigms, and is perhaps best located in this paradigm. Boundary management of knowledge, based on information processing, shared meaning, political considerations [8] Disaster management knowledge management requires cross-boundary engagement, and intense stakeholder engagement and inputs in real time [20] can be developed to contribute to real time crisis response.",

It was argued improving global frameworks for real time research and problem solving is particularly important in contexts in which the data needed for problem solving or crisis management is only available after onset of disasters. It is this need that probabilistic innovation theory and its methodology of crowdsourced R&D seeks to address. Another argument was also made, namely in order to radically accelerate socially important research, it is important to develop a field of research developing theory from experience of extreme disaster contexts as this can develop real time research data collection, synthesis and analysis capabilities. To do this, it is perhaps necessary to develop crowdsourced R&D capacity, harnessing data and information capabilities of social media, which in turn captures productivity enhancements associated with recent technology advances, allowing high volumes of expert problem solving inputs to be focused on solving crisis disaster management problems as well as a host of other research problems in real time. Hence, necessity is framed as driver of invention and innovation, and given real time constraints to problem solving, disaster management is perhaps a useful laboratory for theory development.",
