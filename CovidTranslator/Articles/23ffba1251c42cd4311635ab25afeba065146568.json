The generation of genetic molecular data for BCoV is a major point for a comprehensive Epidemiology of enteric and respiratory disease in cattle caused by this virus. The existence of molecular markers for the differentiation of BCoV lineages allows the generation of genealogic analysis for both BCoV detection and typing. Nonetheless, DNA sequencing is a timeconsuming and expensive technique which needs skilled personnel and high-level laboratory facilities. RFLP has been recently described as a reliable tool for the differentiation of Japanese BCoV lineages (8), but the use of multiple restriction enzymes increases both time and costs for the generation of results. The enzyme restriction assay described herein allows the generation of molecular data in a short time employing a single enzyme; taking into account that all four digestion periods produced identical results (Figure 1), the final enzyme assay protocol can be proposed as based in an 1-hour digestion. It can be concluded that the enzyme assay with GsuI (BpmI) can be used as a rapid tool for differentiation of genotypes of BCoV when compared to DNA sequencing and can help the control of the disease by the tracking of BCoV transmission.",
