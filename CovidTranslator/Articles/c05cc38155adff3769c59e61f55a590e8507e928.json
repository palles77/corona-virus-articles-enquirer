This study was conducted for simultaneous detection and identification of 14 respiratory viruses in Huizhou using real-time PCR. In total, viruses were detected in 48.66 % of ILI patient samples, in which influenza virus (19.98 %) was the most commonly detected, followed by rhinovirus (7.46 %), human coronaviruses (3.63 %), human metapneumovirus (3.06 %), parainfluenza virus (3.06 %), respiratory syncytial virus (2.39 %), adenovirus (2.29 %), and human bocavirus (1.43 %). Co-infections occurred in 5.35 % of all tested specimens and 11.00 % (56/509) of infected patients. Children under 5 years and adults older than 60 years were more likely to have one or more detectable viruses associated with their ILI (OR=1.75, 95 % CI: 1.37; 2.23). Influenza virus was detected during each month of each year, and increased viral activity was observed in 2013. Infections with adenovirus and human metapneumovirus had characteristic seasonal patterns. No significant differences were found in positive the rate between the gender groups, while significantly differences in positive rate were found among the different age groups (P-value\\0.001). This study confirmed that multiple respiratory viruses may circulate concurrently in the population and play an important role in the etiology of ILI. The most frequent symptoms associated with respiratory viruses were sore throat, rhinorrhea and headache. This information needs to be considered by clinicians when treating patients presenting with ILI, and it could serve as a reference for government officers when designing and implementing effective intervention plans.",

            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a major factor responsible for outpatient visits and hospitalizations of infants and young children, and they are also one of the leading causes of child and adult morbidity and mortality worldwide [1] . Respiratory viruses are predominant causes of ARIs, but acute respiratory infection etiology is complex and often remains unknown because an etiological determination is frequently not done for patients with respiratory symptoms, either in the clinic or in the laboratory [2] . Influenza-like illness (ILI), a subset of ARIs, can be attributed to a wide range of respiratory viruses, including influenza virus (IFV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43), and parainfluenza virus (PIV1-3) [3] . Improvement of techniques in molecular biology has resulted in the high-through detection of several respiratory viruses, including novel pathogens such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV) [4] , human bocavirus (HBoV) [5] , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [6] , human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) [7, 8] , coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) [9] [10] [11] , and rhinovirus (HRV), which are generally considered to cause mild upper respiratory illnesses [12, 13] . Patients infected by these diverse viral pathogens develop widely overlapping symptoms, which makes clinical diagnosis unreliable and is a severe limitation to etio-epidemiological investigation.",

Clinical symptoms of viral respiratory infections are too similar to distinguish between etiologic agents. Better identification of the broad spectrum of respiratory viruses for ILI is essential, and this has impelled public health officials to formulate more effective prevention and control strategies, including monitoring of influenza vaccine efficacy in communities [14] . The etiologic agents associated with ILI in developed countries have been well characterized, but less is known concerning the epidemiology and etiology of ILIs caused by agents other than influenza viruses, and only a small number of groups have reported the prevalence and clinical presentation of viral respiratory infections in China [15] [16] [17] . So far, molecular epidemiology of ILI has not been conducted in Huizhou. In order to fill this gap and to better understand the etiological pattern in Huizhou, the clinical characteristics, epidemiological patterns, and viral pathogens involved in ILI were investigated in a local population admitted to Huizhou Municipal Central Hospital with ILI during July 2011 and July 2013. The methods used in this study represent a significant improvement over conventional methods for the detection of a broad spectrum of respiratory viruses.",

Nevertheless, most of the data on the epidemiological features and etiological characteristics of influenza-like illness were from more-developed regions in the world, and less is known about the etiology of influenza-like illness in China, especially in cities. The accurate and rapid analysis of a broad range of viral agents is critical for etiological investigations. In the present study, a continuous surveillance of 14 respiratory viruses of patients with influenzalike illness was conducted in Huizhou, China, from July 2011 to July 2013. Detection rates of respiratory viruses in patients with ILIs have been variable from report to report. In our study, the overall detection rate of respiratory viruses was 48.66 %, consistent with previous findings, which range from 37 % to 48 % [19] [20] [21] [22] , but it was a little lower than that observed in studies performed in France [23] . These differences could be due to environmental factors, population distribution, economic status, and the diagnostic techniques used. In addition, the sampling periods could also lead to differences in detection rates among studies. Hasman et al. [24] carried out a study during two successive winters in the USA and found 68 % samples from patients with influenza-like illness to be positive for at least one virus. In these studies, respiratory specimens were collected only during the winter. In contrast, our study was conducted continuously from July 2011 through July 2013, including not only epidemic but also non-epidemic seasons of influenza-like illness. Furthermore, infections from as yet unknown viruses may be responsible for ILI, and bacteria, such as M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae, were not investigated in this study. The respiratory viruses that have been found most commonly have differed considerably among studies. In the USA, influenza A virus infections were found most commonly, followed by RSV and PIVs [24] . In France, the respiratory viruses detected most frequently were HMPV and RSV [23] . In Italy and Belgium, the sequences were influenza virus, ADV, and PIVs [25] and influenza virus, HRV, and RSV [26] , respectively. In our study, the viruses detected most frequently were influenza viruses (positive rate, 19.98 %). These data are consistent with the positive rate observed in Zhuhai [27] . IFVA was more prevalent than IFVB in our study (12.91 % versus 7.07 %), while higher incidence of IFVB than IFVA was observed in Jinan [28] . Our study also highlighted a clear seasonal distribution of IFV. IFVB was active in the winter and IFVA was active in spring and summer.",

A novel avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged and spread among humans in China during the spring of 2013. In order to find more patients without delay, ILI surveillance in national sentinel hospitals all over the mainland of China was strengthened. The possible reason for the peak in virus detection in April-July 2013 was that more samples were collected for etiological investigation. During the study period, H1N1pdm09 virus was the most prominent subtype in Huizhou, while the A/H1N1 subtype was not detected. It is possible that the epidemic of H1N1pdm09 interfered with the appearance of the A/H1N1 subtype. Of the total cases of ILI, 7.07 % were IFVB, which was the predominant viral pathogen and occurred mainly in cold winter. The incidence of influenza B was significantly higher among patients with ILI who were in the school-age group and the 15-to 24-year-old group.",

In our study, HRV seems to occur throughout the year with no discernable incidence peak, consistent with previous findings [31] . RSV, which has been reported to be almost as common as influenza viruses, had the greatest impact on children under 5 years [32] .
