            "text": "Sir, Since a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, Hubei province in China in December 2019, the number of cases has increased abruptly, with the infection spreading rapidly to other Chinese cities and to more than two dozen countries around the world [1] . As of 23 rd February 2020, 26 cases (16 imported and 10 indigenous) of COVID-19 had been diagnosed in Taiwan [2] . Notably, hospital-associated transmission of the COVID-19 to health-care workers and hospitalized patients has been reported [3] . Furthermore, Zou et al revealed that similar viral loads are seen in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients, indicating the transmission potential of asymptomatic patients [4] . Herein, we report a patient who presented to an case is prohibited from entering the hospital, and is directed to the emergency department for isolation in a negatively pressurized room or an outdoor quarantine station ( Figure 1B) [6] . Failure to identification of COVID-19 cases in a timely fashion can paralyze a medical centre, disrupt public health systems and cause huge economic losses [7, 8] . Which interventions will eventually control this global COVID-19 outbreak is unclear, but sharing of experiences and measures to contain COVID-19 in hospitalS are paramount.",

On 22 nd January he attended KCGMH Dermatology outpatient clinic with tinea cruris. On the following day he sought medical attention at an external Otolaryngology clinic because of worsening respiratory illness. On the next day, a throat swab from the patient was reported as testing positive for COVID-19. The patient was admitted to hospital for management. Contact tracing was immediately started at KCGMH and all medical personnel who had been exposed to the affected patient were quarantined. At the time of writing, the patient remained in hospital, but his clinical condition had improved. None of the quarantined individuals become infected. KCGMH is one of the most reputed medical centres in Taiwan, with 2,500 inpatient beds and 5,500 staff. The exposure and possible infection of health-care workers poses a massive challenge to the delivery of medical services at KCGMH. In response to such situation, individual immigration data can be accessed by national health insurance cards. This strategy strengthens the information about the personal travel history, and helps close the loophole that people do not disclose their travel histories because fear of being forcibly isolated.
