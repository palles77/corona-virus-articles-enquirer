Except for a principal human to human transmission method by droplet and contact, there is still limited knowledge about possible alternate transmission methods to guide clinical care. Recent clinical studies have observed digestive symptoms in COVID-19 patients 1 , possibly because of the enrichment and infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract, mediated by virus receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) 2 , which suggests the potential for a fecaloral route of SARS-CoV-2 transmission 3, 4 . However, there is still a large gap in the biological knowledge of COVID-19. In this study, via a bulk-to-cell strategy focusing on ACE2, we performed an integrated omics analysis at the genome, transcriptome and proteome levels in bulk tissues and single cells across species to decipher the potential routes for SARS-CoV-2 infection in depth.",

In this study, ACE2 was confirmed to be enriched in epithelia of intestinal tract; therefore, a mutual interaction potentially occurred that SARS-CoV-2 disrupted ACE2 activity, infected the intestinal epithelium by its cytotoxicity and shed into feces, resulting in gastrointestinal manifestations and/or positive SARS-CoV-2 in stool 4, 8 . Considering the physiological renew of intestinal epithelia every 4-5 days, our results warn that more attention must be given to the possibility of fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 especially by asymptomatic carriers.",

The line represented the NX value of ACE2 across all tissues. At the protein level, in samples from HPA, 9 tissues were stained with ACE2, among which 5 tissues were highly stained, including tissues from two digestive organs (duodenum and small intestine), and 4 tissues were minimally stained, including tissues from digestive organs (colon and rectum). Furthermore, similar to ACE2 mRNA, ACE2 protein was enriched in the kidney and testis. The bar indicated the immunohistochemical results for ACE2 protein. Antibody staining was reported as not detected, low, medium, or high, and the score was based on the staining intensity and fraction of stained cells. .08 \u00b1 4.02) was higher than that in the lung cell lines (n = 194; -5.00 \u00b1 3.51; ****, P = 2.88 \u00d7 10 -6 ), but there was no significant difference between the kidney (n = 32; -4.92 \u00b1 3.59) and lung cell lines.
