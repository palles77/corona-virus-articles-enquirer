This outbreak also marked the beginning of large-scale real-time molecular epidemiology. Herein, we show how evolutionary analyses of Ebola virus genome sequences provided key insights into virus origins, evolution, and spread during the epidemic. We provide basic scientists, epidemiologists, medical practitioners, and other outbreak responders with an enhanced understanding of the utility and limitations of pathogen genomic sequencing. This will be crucially important in our attempts to track and control future infectious disease outbreaks.",

After this initial spill-over infection, the outbreak remained undetected for several months and spread via chains of sustained human-to-human transmission, with no evidence of additional zoonotic transfers from the animal reservoir [1] [2] [3] [4] . By the time that EBOV (a lineage later named the Makona variant 5 ) was confirmed in March 2014, several villages, towns, and larger cities had reported cases 1 . When the World Health Organization declared the EVD outbreak to constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in August 2014 6 , EBOV had already spread across country borders with more than a thousand cases reported in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Nigeria. In the epidemic that followed, a total of 28,646 confirmed and suspected cases of EVD were documented, with 11,323 recorded deaths, making it by far the largest outbreak of EVD on record 7 .",

            "text": "Ebola virus is a negative-sense single-strand RNA ((\u2212)ssRNA) virus with a 19 kilobase genome, and like most other RNA viruses quickly generates mutations through error-prone replication. Until recently, genomic studies of infectious disease outbreaks were necessarily retrospective, occurring after the pathogen had either been eradicated or developed endemic transmission in the host population [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, recent developments in high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) [13] [14] [15] [16] enabled rapid and in-depth viral genomic surveillance during the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic [1] [2] [3] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Indeed, with the advent of NGS it is now possible to generate pathogen genomic data directly from diagnostic patient samples 2,3,17-27 within days or hours of the sample being taken 25, 26 , and in challenging field situations 19, 23, 25, 26 . The resulting large-scale sequence data sets provide new opportunities for the epidemiological investigation of transmission chains and the improvement of outbreak responses 28 . In the case of the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic, the sequence data generated have revealed key aspects of the patterns and processes of EBOV evolution as the epidemic proceeded 2, 3, [20] [21] [22] [24] [25] [26] 29, 30 . Hence, not only was the 2013-2016 epidemic a landmark in the epidemiological history of EBOV, but the size of the resulting genomic data set -over 1,500 full-length EBOV Makona sequences (Table 1) , or approximately 5% of those infected -also make it one of the most densely sampled infectious disease outbreaks (Fig. 1a, b) . Although sequence data have been generated from outbreaks of viral disease for over 30 years [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 31, 32 , the sheer size of the data set, the widespread spatial coverage (Fig.  1a) , and the contemporary nature of the EBOV data provide the first in-depth genomic anatomy of an epidemic, setting a benchmark for future outbreak responses. In the following we illustrate how pathogen sequences produced during the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic provided key insights into EBOV genomic epidemiology and molecular evolution, and note the lessons that need to be learned for the effective study of future outbreaks. believed that bats serve as the primary reservoir for EBOV 34, 35 . However, EBOV infections have only been confirmed in a small number of mammalian species and it is unclear whether the virus infects a wider range of animal hosts that have yet to be sampled. Some evidence for a broader host distribution, at least in the evolutionary past, comes from the observation that endogenous filoviruses are present in the genomes of diverse mammalian species, including marsupials 36, 37 .",

Between 1977 and 2014, 12 smaller outbreaks were reported in Middle Africa, with 32 to 315 cases and CFRs ranging from 47% to 89% 41 . The 2013-2016 EVD epidemic is therefore notable not only for its duration and magnitude, but also as the first outbreak in West Africa and the first where case exportations and nosocomial transmissions were reported outside of Africa 41 . However, despite the scale of the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic, infection with EBOV Makona appears to lead to similar disease characteristics and transmission profiles as previous EBOV outbreak variants 42, 43 . For example, the CFR for the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic appears to be ~7 0% 1, 39, 40, 43 and estimates for the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) fall between 1.5-2.5, both of which are comparable to calculations from previous outbreaks 39, [44] [45] [46] [47] .",

One of the most important early questions was whether the epidemic was the result of a single cross-species transmission event into humans, or whether there were repeated zoonotic events from a widespread animal EBOV reservoir. Due to the high genetic similarity of virus genomes sampled from the beginning of the epidemic, a single spill-over infection seems the most likely 1,2 . Phylogenetic analyses also make it clear that once the outbreak was established, later lineages of EBOV Makona have descended from those circulating earlier in the epidemic (Fig. 1c) 2, 3, [20] [21] [22] 24, 25 . This is in contrast to some of the earlier EVD outbreaks, in which epidemiological and sequence-based investigations have provided evidence for multiple spill-over infections 49, 50 .",

In particular, molecular clock dating analyses suggest that the common ancestor of all sequenced EBOV Makona lineages be placed at the beginning of 2014 2,21,48 , with lineages in Guinea falling close to the root of the tree (Fig. 1c) . These studies also showed that EBOV Makona diverged from other EBOV outbreak variants only about a decade ago 2, 48 . This suggests that EBOV Makona may be fairly new to West Africa, sharing recent common ancestry with Middle African variants that are thousands of miles away. Molecular clock dating analyses have also shown that all recorded human EVD outbreaks caused by EBOV appear to share a common ancestor around 1975 2,51 . Strikingly, this is around the time of the first described EVD outbreak in 1976, suggesting that the EBOV lineage experienced a severe genetic bottleneck prior to the first human outbreak 52, 53 . Despite their power 54 , molecular clock dating studies of this type would undoubtedly benefit from additional EBOV genomic sequence data from both previous EVD outbreaks and animal reservoir populations.",

However, the much larger size and duration of the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic (Fig. 1a, b) resulted in a different molecular epidemiological pattern for EBOV Makona, in which multiple virus lineages arose and co-circulated (Fig. 1c) .",

Genomic studies have shown that the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic was dominated by three major lineages, denoted 'A' 21, 25 , 'SL2\u2032 2 , and 'SL3\u2032 2,3 (Fig. 1c) . Most of these lineages -including lineage A 21, 25 in Guinea, SL3 in Sierra Leone 3 , and Liberian isolates 24 -circulated locally, with only sporadic cross-border transmissions (Fig. 1c) . In contrast, lineage SL2 2 has been the most widespread in the region (Fig. 1c) 3, 21, 22, 24, 25 . This lineage likely arose in Sierra Leone 2 where it gave rise to lineage SL3 and several sublineages 3, 22 . It crossed more than twice into Liberia 24 , seeded several transmission chains in Guinea 21 , and spread throughout Sierra Leone 2,3,22 (Fig. 1c) . It is unclear whether any of these lineages carry mutations that could have affected their epidemic potential 60 , orperhaps more likely -whether the increased geographical spread of SL2 and SL3 is a reflection of chance epidemiological founding events (see later section below) 60, 61 .",

This rate was approximately twice as high as that averaged from genomic sequences of EBOV variants a sampled from multiple outbreaks, at ~0 .9 \u00d7 10 \u22123 [0.81, 1.18 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ] subs/site/year 2 . However, later studies of EBOV Makona consistently produced lower rate estimates than that generated by Gire et al. 3, 21, 22, 25 . Indeed, taking the publicly available sequence data as a whole, estimates of the EBOV evolutionary rate for the 2013-2016 outbreak converge on a mean value of ~1 .2 \u00d7 10 \u22123 [1.13, 1.27 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ] (Fig. 2) . The ensuing discussions of whether EBOV is evolving more or less rapidly than expected, and what this means for the ability of the virus to evolve changes in transmissibility and virulence, have become a common narrative [67] [68] [69] [70] .",

            "text": "The debate over the evolutionary dynamics of EBOV highlights a number of general issues in viral evolution. First, estimates of evolutionary rate are generally expected to be higher within than between outbreaks. This is because the relatively short time-scale over which sequences are sampled during outbreaks may be insufficient for mutations to be removed (or less likely be fixed) by either natural selection or genetic drift. Hence, pathogen genomic sequences sampled early within epidemics will contain an excess of mildly deleterious variants that would eventually be eliminated by purifying selection 61 . This will tend to inflate evolutionary rates and in part explains why evolutionary rates in RNA viruses are often 'time-dependent': high toward the present, low toward the past 71, 72 . Indeed, it is notable that as the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic progressed analyses of evolutionary rate in EBOV converged on a reliable estimate (Fig. 2) , which is expected due to the increasing size of the data set combined with a longer sampling period. When viewed in the context of viruses as a whole, it is also striking that all the evolutionary rate estimates for EBOV fall in a narrow range towards the center of a distribution that spans more than three orders of magnitude, from ~1 0 \u22122 to ~1 0 \u22125 subs/site/year (Fig. 2) .",

Both of these scenarios would increase the within-outbreak rate. Potential evidence for fundamental differences in evolutionary dynamics associated with species jumping is provided by the EBOV Lomela variant that emerged in the DRC during 2014, causing a small EVD outbreak with 69 cases 74 . The branch length on the EBOV phylogenetic tree leading to the EBOV Lomela sequences from their common ancestor is far shorter than expected from their sampling time in 2014 (Fig. 3a) , indicating a markedly lower evolutionary rate 74, 75 . This could reflect an evolutionary history in a different reservoir host to those previously described for EBOV, in which replication rates and hence evolutionary rates are reduced, or where purifying selection acts with greater potency than in humans. Intriguingly, lower EBOV evolutionary rates were also observed in suspected cases of transmission from human EVD survivors during the 2013-2016 epidemic (Fig. 3b) 76, 77 . Unexpectedly low evolutionary rates may therefore serve as an important signal of transmissions from EVD survivors during flareups 26, 76 (Fig. 3b) .",

The most straight-forward measure of the rate of molecular evolution is the nucleotide 'substitution a EBOV outbreak variants are viral lineages responsible for human outbreaks. Other EBOV variants include EBOV Yambuku (Mayinga) from 1976, EBOV Kikwit from 1995, and EBOV Lomela from 2014 (DRC). The between-outbreak evolutionary rate therefore reflects estimates averaged across all EBOV variants. rate', which describes the frequency that mutations are fixed in populations through time and for EBOV is best approximated by the rate observed between outbreaks (Box 1) 61 . This rate reflects the long-term evolutionary process of selective constraints on the genome, host species-specific adaptation and the cumulative results of genetic drift. The rate of change within outbreaks might be better thought of as the 'evolutionary rate' as the short time-scale of sampling necessarily means that not all mutations observed will be fixed. Both the substitution rate and evolutionary rate can be clearly distinguished from the 'mutation rate'. This term relates to the rate at which mutations are generated during viral replication by intrinsic biochemical factors, particularly how frequently the viral polymerase makes errors 78 (Box 1). This rate is generally challenging to measure 79, 80 and is unknown for most viruses, including EBOV. It is therefore unfortunate that the debate over EBOV evolution has focused on 'mutation' (and hence potential differences intrinsic to particular virus lineages) when this is not the parameter that has been measured.",

Without direct experimental data, however, a simpler scenario is that the scale and severity of the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic reflects a different epidemiological context than previous outbreaks. Under this model, most -if not all -EBOV variants entering human populations following cross-species transmissions have the ability to cause major epidemics, but have been unable to do so because of a lack of susceptible host population and/or environment. In particular, previous EVD outbreaks occurred in largely isolated and rural areas 41 (with the notable exception of the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit, which has a population of ~400,000 41 ), where there were either an insufficient number of susceptibles to guarantee long-term transmission, or the outbreak was quickly controlled by efficient interventions. The 2013-2016 EVD epidemic, in contrast, was the first in West Africa and the first in which a large EVD epidemic resulted in sustained community transmission from rural settings to major urban centers, where it was easier to establish large-scale transmission networks. This included the establishment of 'underground' networks, amplified by reluctance in the affected communities, that greatly hindered intervention strategies focused on breaking chains of transmission. That the scale of the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic more reflects virus epidemiology rather than virus evolution is also supported by the failure to find evidence for heritable changes in the duration of virus shedding or virulence during the course of the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic 39, 40, [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] .",

Because of its key role in virus-host interactions, most attention has been directed toward the EBOV glycoprotein (GP), and it is notable that the highest level of genetic amino acid diversity generated during the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic occurred in the GP (in particular, its mucin-like domain) 3, 22 . For example, we observed 104 amino acid changes in GP that are shared by at least two EBOV Makona lineages across the ~1,500 publicly available complete EBOV genomes that make up about 5% of the more than 28,000 reported EVD cases 7 . While it is not known whether any of these amino acid changes lead to functional differences, one plausibly important GP variant that originated early in the epidemic (in lineage SL2) 24 is an Alanine to Valine change at residue 82 (A82V). This is the first substitution observed in the receptor binding domain of EBOV and could potentially alter the interaction between the EBOV GP and its host receptor NPC1 82, 83 . Clearly, determining whether lineages of EBOV Makona carrying A82V or other mutations that arose during the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic differ in epidemic potential should be a research priority.",

Similarly, phylogenetic analyses revealed the co-circulation of multiple EBOV lineages within individual localities such as Conakry 20 , as well as cross-border virus traffic between Guinea and Sierra Leone 25 , highlighting important gaps in intervention. On a more localized epidemiological scale, genome sequence data provide a way to reveal who-infected-whom in EBOV transmission networks (although see below). Pathogen sequence data can therefore yield key information on the likelihood of, for example, sexual transmissions 77,85-88 , as well as the possible transmission of EBOV via breast milk 26 . A similarly precise reconstruction of transmission chains is essential in understanding the multiple reignition events that occurred during the EBOV epidemic and their relation to viral transmissions from EVD survivors (Fig. 3b) 76 . It is unclear whether the small subset of EVD survivors that harbor persistent infections pose a sustained infection risk or whether an episode of renewed viral replication is required for transmission to occur. Considering the pattern and degree of EBOV genetic change within such cases may provide critical insights. Phylogenetic approaches also provide a powerful way to accurately estimate various outbreak parameters, such as R 0 , including that for individual virus lineages that are slow and difficult to obtain using longitudinal case data 90, 91 . Finally, the identification of virus 'super spreaders' within human populations can also be readily achieved based on pathogen sequence data 92 .",

This will offer critical information to inform epidemiological intervention, but will require a willingness to invest in scientific infrastructure, healthcare, and training of local staff in the affected countries 94 . The need for immediate analysis and the growth of open sharing of sequence data means the challenge in genomic studies may be moving from data acquisition to analysis and interpretation. However, it is also the case that in-country real-time sequencing was not established until relatively late in the West African epidemic 19, 23, 25, 26, 93 , when case numbers had already begun to decline. In addition, many of the genome sequences were obtained in the absence of strong clinical and epidemiological metadata, such as the precise geographical location from where the sample was obtained, whether the individual survived the infection, and the time to the onset of symptoms. While it may be difficult to obtain such data during a rapidly developing outbreak, this limits the usefulness of genomic sequencing data in addressing a number of central biological questions, such as the virological basis to any variation in disease presentation and the evolution of pathogen virulence. An important lesson for the study and management of future disease outbreaks is not only that portable sequencing platforms should be deployed as rapidly as possible, but that each sequence obtained should be linked to as much relevant metadata as is ethically and technically possible.",

For future outbreaks it will be important to resolve exact chains of transmission (i.e., who-infected-whom) as this provides vital information on the patterns and mechanisms of virus spread within single communities and hospitals, which will help target interventions. Sequence data from the 2013-2016 EVD epidemic indicated that these chains were difficult to infer using the population consensus sequences from individual hosts, although in several cases they were shown to be in agreement with epidemiological studies 2,3,25 . Hence, although EBOV evolves rapidly, mutations are not necessarily fixed at the scale of individual transmission events, which limits phylogenetic resolution. One solution is to examine the transmission patterns of intra-host single nucleotide variants (iSNVs) 3 . If multiple iSNVs are routinely transmitted between individuals (i.e., that EBOV is not subject to a severe population bottleneck at inter-host transmission) then tracking the inheritance patterns of these variants can provide information on how transmission patterns exist between individual hosts, as previously shown for influenza virus 95, 96 . Importantly, it has been shown that significant intra-host variation can be observed for EBOV, with 2-5 iSNVs per infected patient typical when using a minor allele frequency cutoff of 5% [2] [3] [4] 26 . As the cutoff is lowered, the numbers of observed iSNVs increase sharply 2,3 .",

This can be measured by methods that compare the genetic change in viral genomes collected at different times. Importantly, evolutionary rates in RNA viruses may be dependent on the time-scale over which they are measured: they are elevated in the short-term, such as within disease outbreaks, because mildly deleterious mutations may not have been eliminated by purifying selection71,72 .",
