They are also the primary cause of sporadic and epidemic acute gastroenteritis worldwide [4, 5] .The morbidity and mortality associated with norovirus infection impacts disproportionately the elderly, immunocompromised individuals [6] and, in developing countries, children [7] . Combating noroviruses presents a major challenge because noroviruses are highly contagious, genetically diverse, environmentally stable, display prolonged and profuse viral shedding, evolve rapidly, and are capable of spreading in many different ways [8, 9] . There are currently no effective vaccines or norovirus-specific antivirals for norovirus infection. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the discovery and development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment and prophylaxis of norovirus infection [10, 13] .",

Among these hydrogen bonds, the backbone NH and carbonyl O of the Ala160 residue forms two hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyl O and NH of the P 3 residue of the inhibitor ( Figure 2A ). In addition, a third hydrogen bond exists between the backbone O of the Ala158 residue and the backbone NH of the P 1 residue of the inhibitor. This hydrogen bonding arrangement resembles the hydrogen bonding pattern found in antiparallel \u03b2sheets and serves to correctly orient and position the inhibitor (or substrate) backbone to the active site. The hydrogen bonding associated with an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet is more feasible when an inhibitor (or substrate) binds to the active site of a protease in a \u03b2-strand conformation, the extended \"saw tooth\" conformation of a peptide (\u03d5 = -120 \u00b1 20 0 and \u03c8 = +120 \u00b1 20 0 ) where the backbone NHs are exposed to the environment [27] .

Macrocyclization of linear peptidyl inhibitors was accomplished by tethering the P 1 and P 3 residues of the linear inhibitor by a suitable linker, thereby pre-organizing the macrocycle in a \u03b2-strand conformation prior to binding to the enzyme active site ( Figure 2B ) [27] [28] . This approach results in the formation of a preorganized and semi-rigid entity that displays the amino acid side chains in a well-defined vector relationship for optimal binding and enhances the affinity of the inhibitor to the target enzyme by minimizing the entropy loss upon binding. Additional potential advantages of macrocyclic inhibitors include high stability to metabolizing enzymes, high selectivity and, frequently, increased cellular permeability [29] [30] [31] [32] . We describe herein the structure-based design of macrocyclic inhibitors of norovirus 3CLpro where the side chain of the P1 Gln primary substrate specificity residue is tethered to the P3 residue via a triazole linker to yield macrocycles (I) (Figure 1 ) and explore the effect of ring size on conformation and its impact on pharmacological activity using high field NMR and X-ray crystallographic studies.",

The coordinates of the Ramachandran plot (see Figure S8 in Supporting information) of six \u03d5 and \u03c8 angle pairs of the corresponding P 2 and P 3 residues, extracted from the X-ray crystal structures, lie in the upper left quadrant of the plot, indicating that bound inhibitors 1, 3, and 10 assume an extended \u03b2-strand conformation. The pseudo \u03d5 angles of the P 1 residue covalently bound to the Cys139 residue range from -129.5 o to -137.8 o . The electron density maps for the three bound inhibitors are shown in Figure 4A -C. As expected, the backbones of all three inhibitors are structurally more rigid compared to the atoms forming the macrocyclic linker, which is more flexible. This is evident from an analysis of the B-factors for the inhibitors in each structure, which are slightly lower in the backbone region as shown in the right panels of Figure 4A -C. The electron density for the \"cap\" phenyl ring was not observed for 1 and 3 due to disorder and could not be modeled, while inhibitor 10 has somewhat weak electron density that permitted modelling of the phenyl ring. The triazole ring of inhibitor 3 has reasonable electron density, however, it is more disordered and its exact orientation is not clearly discernible ( Figure 4 ). Table 1 indicates that, with the exception of compounds 8 and 11, the rest of the compounds displayed low micromolar IC 50 values. The observed degree of inhibition prompted us to delineate the structural determinants associated with binding in order to gain insight and understanding into the relative potency of the inhibitors. Toward that end, superposition with GESAMT 33 of the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the NV 3CLpro:10 complex (largest ring size) with the NV 3CLPro:1 complex (smallest ring size) shows that the enzyme structures in both complexes are similar, with an RMSD between C\uf061 atoms of 0.76 \u00c5 (167 residues), except for the flexible loop spanning Lys121 to Glu140 ( Figure 5A ). The binding of inhibitor 10 (larger ring size) to the active site is accompanied by the movement of the flexible loop away from the inhibitor resulting in the loss of a hydrogen bond between the P 1 side chain (Gln C=O) of the inhibitor with Thr134 (backbone NH) which forms the S 1 pocket. His157, which is the other constituent of the S 1 pocket but is not a part of the flexible loop, maintains a hydrogen bond interaction with the P 1 Gln C=O ( Figure 5B ). It should be noted that the interaction of NV 3CLpro with acyclic dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl inhibitors involves the formation of two crucial hydrogen bonds between the carbonyl oxygen of the glutamine surrogate C=O in the inhibitor and the Thr134 and His157 residues [12] . These two hydrogen bonding interactions, as well as the flexible backbone of the T123-G133 loop [34] , appear to play a critical role in enzyme-substrate recognition and are conserved in all norovirus proteases. Thus, in the NV 3CLpro:1 complex, the movement of the flexible loop and the shorter linker length of the inhibitor which positions the carbonyl oxygen of the P 1 Gln side chain away from His157 and Thr134, results in the loss of the Thr134 P 1 Gln C=O hydrogen bond ( Figure 5C ). Conversely, the binding of inhibitor 1 allows the flexible loop to move closer to the inhibitor such that a contact can be formed (3.3 \u00c5) between Pro136 and the carbonyl oxygen of the warhead ( Figure 5B ).",

On the other hand, as mentioned above, the compact, rigid ring structure and the additional hydrogen bond with Ala160, discernible from the X-ray crystal structure, may account for the 4-fold decrease in the IC 50 In summary, the interaction of macrocyclic inhibitors (I) with NV 3CLpro induces conformational changes in the flexible loop and active site of the enzyme which are dependent on macrocycle ring size and structure. These changes result in sub-optimal angles and distances in forming the critical intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the P1 Gln side chain and the active site His157 and Thr134 residues, consequently, maximal binding potency and effective compensation for the energy penalty required to desolvate the molecule, are not attained.",

            "text": "Assignment of the proton resonances was done using 1 H, COSY, ROESY and HMBC spectral details. The ROESY spectra of the compounds show H i\u03b1 to NH (i+1) type correlation, where the Gln and Leu NH show correlation to the Leu H\u03b1 and carbamate H\u03b1, respectively (see Figures S1-S5 in Supporting Information). This observation is indicative of a prearranged structure within the macrocycle [28] . The temperature dependence of amide NH chemical shifts experiments were performed using compounds 28a (ring size: 17), 28e (ring size: 20) and 28g (ring size: 21), revealing important information about the solution structures of the macrocycles. Solvent shielded NH protons typically have \u0394\u03b4/T values less than 4 ppb/K while solvent exposed NH protons have \u0394\u03b4/T values greater than 4 ppb/K [28] . According to the results, the Gln, Leu, and propargylglycine NH protons have \u0394\u03b4/T values greater than 4 ppb/K in all cases (Table 3) . At larger ring sizes, the carbamate NH shows a higher temperature dependence (-7.0 and 6.4 ppb/K for ring sizes 20 and 21, respectively), indicating greater solvent exposure. However, for smaller ring size it shows comparatively low temperature dependence (4.2 ppb/K at 17 ring size), indicating less solvent exposure. This is further supported by the observed line broadening of the carbamate NH proton at elevated temperatures for compounds 28e and 28g, and the lower line broadening observed for 28a ( Figure S6 in Supporting Information). Previous studies have shown that amide signals exchanging with water impurity present in DMSO solvent show considerable broadening of the line width at elevated temperatures due to the enhanced exchange rate at higher temperatures [28] . At smaller ring size, all three NH protons show less temperature dependence, indicating solvent shielding which is partly due to the compact nature of the compound. The absence of very low temperature dependent NH protons (~ 2 ppb/K) would appear to rule out the presence of alternative turn structures, such as \u03b3-turns. Finally, the conformations of the peptide backbone of macrocycles 28a and 28h were determined based on 1D 3 J NH-CH\u03b1 coupling constants (Table 4 ). The coupling constant 3 J NH-CH\u03b1 correlates with the dihedral angle (\u03c8) according to the Karplus equation [28] . For unstructured random coil conformations the coupling constant is around 7 Hz while unusually high coupling constants (> 9 Hz) are observed for well-structured \u03b2-strands. According to the results shown in Table 4 , the expected \u03b2-strand conformation was observed only for the 17-membered ring.",

The commercially available N-Boc protected L-propargylglycine was reacted with L-leucine methy lester, Lcyclohexylalanine methyl ester or L-phenylalanine methyl ester, in the presence of EDCI and HOBt to provide the corresponding dipeptide esters. Deblocking of the resulting esters was accomplished by treatment with 4M HCl in dioxane. The resulting amine hydrochlorides were reacted with benzylchloroformate followed by LiOH to yield the corresponding N-Cbz protected dipeptide acid intermediates 15a-c. Preparation of the HCl salts of amino azides 18a-e was effected by sequential reaction of commercially available N-Boc protected amino alcohols with methanesulfonyl chloride and sodium azide followed by deprotection with 4M HCl in dioxane. Coupling of N-Boc protected glutamic acid with the corresponding HCl salts of amino azides 18a-e in the presence of EDCI and HOBt gave intermediates 19a-e, in good yields. The macrocyclization step was effected in two different ways. Specifically, the synthesis of macrocycles 2-3 entailed click chemistry-mediated macrocyclization using intermediates 15a-c and 20a-b (Scheme 2), while compounds 1 and 4-11 were obtained through macrolactamization starting with key intermediates 15a-c and 19a-e (Scheme 3). In general, the macrolactamization methodology was found to be superior, particularly in terms of ease of purification of the resultant cyclized products.",

Enzyme assays and inhibition studies.The IC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration in enzyme assay) values of protease inhibitors against 3CLpro were determined as described previously by our lab13 . Each compound was evaluated for anti-3CLpro effects up to 100 \u00b5M. For the cell based assay, one day old HG23 cells (NV replicon harboring cells) were treated with various concentrations (1.0 to 100 \u00b5M) of each compound, and incubated for 48 h. Then total RNA was extracted from cells for qRT-PCR for norovirus and \u03b2-actin. The EC 50 (50% inhibitory concentration in cell based assay) of each compound was calculated by the % reduction of RNA levels to Mocktreated cells after normalized with \u03b2-actin levels. Cell cytotoxicity using HG23 was measured by a CytoTox96\u00ae nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) with serial dilution of each compound up to 100 \u00b5M following the manufacturer's instructions. The CC 50 (50% cytotoxic concentration) was determined for each compound. The IC 50 , EC 50 and CC 50 values were determined by at least two independent experiments. 4.3. X-ray crystallographic studies. Crystallization and data collection. Purified Norwalk virus 3CLpro (NV 3CLpro) in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM PBS pH 7.2, 1 mM DTT at a concentration of 10 mg/mL was used for preparation of the NV 3CLpro-ligand complex. A stock solution of 100 mM compound 1, 3, or 10 was prepared in DMSO and each NV 3CLpro:inhibitor complex was prepared by mixing 12 \u00b5L of 1, 3 or 10 (3 mM) with 388 \u03bcL (0.49 mM) of NV 3CLpro and incubating on ice for 1 hour. The buffer was exchanged to 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 using a Vivaspin-20 concentrator (MWCO=5kDa, Vivaproducts, Inc.) and the samples were concentrated to 10, 8.4 and 12.0 mg/mL respectively for crystallization screening. All crystallization experiments were conducted Compact Jr. (Rigaku Reagents) sitting drop vapor diffusion plates at 20 o C using equal volumes of protein and crystallization solution equilibrated against 75 \u00b5L of the latter. Crystals of NV 3CLpro-ligand 1 and NV 3CLpro-ligand 10 that displayed prismatic morphology were obtained in 1-2 days from the Index HT screen (Hampton Research) condition H12 (30% (w/v) PEG 2000 MME, 150 mM potassium bromide) (Table 2). Samples were transferred to a fresh drop composed of 80% crystallization solution and 20% glycerol and stored in liquid nitrogen. Crystals that displayed a plate morphology formed for NV 3CLpro-ligand 3 in 3 days from the Wizard 3 and 4 screen (Rigaku Reagents) A10 (20% (w/v) PEG3350, 200 mM sodium thiocyanate). The crystals tended to form clusters that needed to be separated in order to obtain a suitable sample for X-ray data collection. Samples were transferred to a fresh drop composed of 80% crystallization solution and 20% PEG 200 and stored in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 17-ID using a Dectris Pilatus 6M pixel array detector.4.4. Structure Solution and Refinement.Intensities were integrated using XDS[36][37] and the Laue class analysis and data scaling were performed with Aimless 38 which suggested that the highest probability Laue class was 2/m and space group C2 for NV CLpro:1 and NV 3CLpro:10. For NV 3CLpro:3, the highest probability space group was P1. The Matthew's coefficient39 suggested that there was a single molecule in the asymmetric unit (Vm=1.8 \u00c5 3 /Da, % solvent=32%) for NV 3CLPro:1, NV 3CLpro:10 and two molecules for NV 3CLPro:3 (Vm=2.2 \u00c5 3 /Da, % solvent=45%). Structure solution was conducted by molecular replacement with Phaser 40 using a previously determined structure of inhibitor bound NV 3CLpro (PDB: 3UR913 ) as the search model and for NV 3CLpro:3, a single solution was obtained for two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. Structure refinement using and manual model building were conducted with Phenix 41 and Coot 42 respectively. Anisotropic atomic displacement parameters were refined for all atoms except solvent molecules for NV 3CLPro:1 and NV 3CLpro:10. Disordered side chains were truncated to the point for which electron density could be observed. Structure validation was conducted with Molprobity 43 and figures were prepared using the CCP4MG package44 and PyMOL 45 .4.5. NMR studies.The spectral details, 2D and variable temperature (VT) NMR spectra were taken by a Varian XL-400 MHz NMR spectrometer and sample was prepared by dissolving 30 mg of compound in 1 mL of DMSO-d 6 . Assignment of NH and CH\u03b1 resonances were done using 1D 1 H NMR, COSY, ROESY and HMBC spectral data recorded at 273 K. Temperature dependence of amide NH chemical shifts (\u0394\u03b4/T) were examined within the temperature range of 298-343 K in 5 degree increments.",
