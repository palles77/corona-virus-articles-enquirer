Genotypic analysis of SARS-CoV strains from the recent outbreak reveals that genotypes from persons affected early in the outbreak are more similar to animal SARS-CoV-related viruses than genotypes from persons affected in the middle and later parts of the outbreak. The genotype changes are consistent with positive selective pressures resulting eventually in stabilization and emergence of a predominant genotype [8\u2022\u2022] . Genotypic analysis of the virus involved in one of the recent isolated cases of SARS identified in China reveals that it is much more closely related to the SARS-CoV-related virus of palm civets than any human SARS-CoV detected in the previous outbreak [8\u2022\u2022] . This finding, with seroprevalence data revealing that a small proportion (1.8%) of healthy persons in Hong Kong had been exposed to SARS-CoV-related viruses at least 2 years before the recent SARS outbreak [11\u2022] , suggests that occasional human infection with animal SARS-CoV-related viruses may have occurred undetected for years before the outbreak and may continue to occur. Unlike the outbreak SARS-CoV virus, animal SARS-CoV-related viruses may not have the same propensity to cause severe human disease and may not be able to be transmitted from human to human. Further investigation is needed to understand the circumstances that permitted the selective adaptation and purification processes that resulted in the evolution of the SARS-CoV outbreak strains.",

However, appropriate biosafety measures should minimize this risk, and awareness of this risk should permit early detection of cases and implementation of control measures so that transmission, if it occurs, should be limited. The most likely source of outbreaks is the replication of the event(s) that resulted in the evolution of the SARS-CoV outbreak virus from animal SARS-CoV-related virus. The existence of human or animal reservoirs of the outbreak SARS-CoV virus has been postulated, but is extremely unlikely [12] . Although it is unclear whether new outbreaks of SARS will occur, it is important to be prepared for the possibility that they will. Indeed, much research is ongoing, optimizing diagnostic tests, treatments, and vaccination directed at SARS, and vigilant surveillance is being completed worldwide. Part of this preparation includes understanding the timing and modes of transmission of SARS, and the strategies that allowed for the effective control of the outbreak.",

Despite the absence of transmission, SARS-CoV viral RNA remained detectable in respiratory secretions and stool and urine specimens for more than 30 days in some patients [17] .

Evidence for this includes studies in Hong Kong and Toronto, Canada that show an increased risk for SARS in health care workers who entered the room of a patient with SARS, with increasing risk in those with closer proximity to the patient and those remaining in the room for a longer duration, suggesting that transmission is enhanced by close, prolonged contact [19\u2022,20 \u2022] In addition, an increased risk in household members of patients with SARS has been shown in those who had close, prolonged contact with the index person, and in particular, in those who shared a bed, reported being within 1 meter of the index person, and dined together [21\u2022] . Increasing risk was noted as the duration of time the symptomatic index patient spent at home increased. Exposure to respiratory secretions appears to pose a particular risk, with higher risks for SARS noted in health care workers who assisted with intubation, suctioned before intubation, manipulated oxygen masks, or were present during noninvasive ventilation of a SARS patient for more than 30 minutes [20\u2022,22\u2022] , in addition to higher risks being noted in household members of SARS patients who were coughed at by the index person within 1 meter [21\u2022] .

Although no study has documented the role of fecal-oral transmission, fecal droplet transmission was thought to have played a significant role in the Amoy Gardens community outbreak in Hong Kong. Fecal droplets were thought to have resulted from unsealed floor drain traps that permitted an open connection to the soil stack. Widespread transmission of these droplets was thought to have resulted from the temporary shutdown of the flush water system, powerful room exhaust fans, and a building layout permitting exhausted droplets to re-enter the building at other locations [23] .",

Evidence to support this includes a study in Hong Kong in which self-reported inconsistent hand hygiene practices were associated with an increased risk for SARS among health care workers who reported no contact with patients (odds ratio = 6.4 [1.6-36.2]; P = 0.004) [25\u2022 ].

The studies that suggested this possibility describe specific SARS clusters in which the pattern of transmission for a subset of individuals cannot be explained by droplet or contact transmission. For example, in a study assessing medical students exposed to a single patient, four students who were not within the 3-feet droplet risk zone [26] from the patient acquired SARS [19\u2022] . In an investigation of a nosocomial outbreak in Toronto, one health care worker who had not worked in the index patient's room acquired SARS [20\u2022]. On a flight carrying a symptomatic person with SARS, 90% of the persons who became ill were seated more then 3 feet away from the index patient [27] . Although all of these examples are consistent with possible airborne transmission, alternate explanations implicating indirect contact transmission or unrecognized exposures also are possible. In addition, one can postulate that an enhanced droplet transmission mechanism exists in which droplets are capable of being transmitted beyond the traditional 3-feet radius from the index patient but are incapable of traditional airborne transmission.",

For example, a nurse who was wearing an N95 respirator, two sets of gowns and gloves, safety glasses, a face shield, hair cover, and shoe covers acquired SARS after providing bagvalve-mask ventilation to a patient with SARS [28] . In addition, at least two health care workers using N95 equivalent respirators, gown, gloves, and safety glasses, with or without a face shield, acquired SARS after assisting in the provision of noninvasive ventilation and a difficult intubation of a patient with SARS complicated by copious frothy secretions [29] . Common factors in these scenarios include being involved in a procedure that has the potential to generate aerosols (eg, noninvasive ventilation, intubation) that is being performed on severely ill patients and requires close contact with the patient in the context of using N95 or N95 equivalent respirators that were not fittested. Potential explanations for the through-precautions transmission seen in these scenarios include the possibility of unrecognized breaches in precautions, contamination upon removal of precautions, or an airborne viral load high enough to overwhelm the non-fit-tested N95 or N95 equivalent respirators used. Whether N95 respirators require fit-testing in order to be effective in reducing airborne transmission has not been studied in the clinical setting. Although the United States has supported fit-testing for all N95 respirators since 1972, other countries such as Canada have only done so in response to SARS and specifically in response to the through-precautions transmission scenarios described earlier [29] . Further study is needed to definitely determine the role of fit-testing in preventing air-borne transmission and to better understand the mechanisms responsible for through-precautions transmission.",

This is consistent with an infectious disease spread by contact or droplet transmission [15\u2022] . The relatively fast decrease in the effective reproduction number, R t , to less than 1 noted after implementation of control measures, is suggestive of an infectious disease with relatively low efficiency in transmission that is readily controlled [31] . Data from recent seroprevalence studies support this showing that in typical situations relatively few people with exposure to patients with confirmed SARS-CoV infection actually became infected. For example, typical attack rates among health care workers in hospital settings who used no protection or inconsistent protection ranged from 0% to 8.5% [32] [33] [34] [35] . Typical attack rates in household settings ranged from 4.6% to 8% [21\u2022,36] .

For example, in Guangzhou, the index patient was shown to transmit SARS to 74 other individuals, with an associated large cluster of secondary infections giving rise to the outbreak in Guangzhou [41] . In Singapore, multiple superspreading events were described at the beginning of the outbreak, with one individual responsible for at least 40 other cases of SARS through direct contact [42] .

Host factors, such as age, underlying illness, and increased severity of SARS symptoms may be associated with increased viral shedding, permitting more efficient transmission. Shen et al. [40\u2022] have shown that cases associated with superspreading in Beijing were more likely to be older patients with high case fatality rates. Increased opportunity for exposure through increased interaction with patients (such as that which typically occurs in hospitals settings) may further aid transmission. This is confirmed in the study by Shen et al. [40\u2022] , which showed that superspreading patients in Beijing were more likely to have higher numbers of close contacts than were patients unassociated with superspreading. Although association with aerosol-generating procedures was not seen in Beijing, it has been proposed as an alternate explanation that may further facilitate transmission in superspreading events. Inadequate infection control precautions also may be partly responsible, and after the implementation of control measures in Beijing, superspreading events were greatly reduced [40\u2022] . Whether strain variations in SARS-CoV or coinfections with other organisms might play a role in these situations has not been fully assessed. Superspreading events are not unique to SARS but also have been described with other diseases such as Ebola, rubella, and measles [40\u2022,42] . Additional investigation is needed to further understand the role of various determinants of superspreading events in SARS.",

Epidemiologic risks to consider include: exposure to settings where SARS activity is suspected or documented; a person with an epidemiologic link to a cluster of persons with unexplained respiratory illness, especially when such a cluster occurs within a single health care facility setting; a health care worker with direct patient-care responsibilities; or a laboratory worker in a laboratory that contains live SARS-CoV [43\u2022\u2022] .",

They noted that the risk for acquiring SARS after direct care of a patient with SARS was significantly reduced with the use of N95 respirators or surgical masks and gowns, and hand-washing. Multivariate analysis revealed masks (N95 respirators or surgical masks) to be the only significant protective measure. The authors contend the fact that surgical masks and N95 respirators were effective, with the finding that 30% of noninfected staff did not use masks of any type, supports that transmission is not typically airborne. Loeb et al. [22\u2022 ] completed a retrospective cohort study among 43 nurses, eight of whom acquired SARS after working in one of two Toronto critical care units with SARS patients. They noted that the consistent use of N95 respirators was significantly more protective than was not wearing a mask. The consistent use of surgical masks also reduced the risk, but not significantly. N95 respirators appeared to reduce the risk more than did surgical masks, but not significantly. The use of gowns and gloves was not shown to significantly reduce the risk for SARS. Lau et al. [25\u2022 ] completed a case-control study involving 72 heath care workers with SARS and 144 matched controls from Hong Kong. They noted that transmission of SARS occurred despite almost all of the study respondents using N95 respirators or masks when providing direct care for patients with SARS, suggesting that masks were not sufficient to prevent transmission of SARS. The use of gloves, gowns, goggles, and caps was significantly associated with a reduced risk for acquiring SARS, but the high degree of collinearity in the use of these precautions made it difficult to ascertain which measure was most important. Other findings included an increased risk for SARS among health care workers who perceived there to be an inadequate supply of personal protection equip-ment and among those who received less than 2 hours of SARS infection control training.",

            "text": "Based on these studies and on the fact that the patterns of transmission of SARS suggest droplet and contact modes of transmission, one can suppose that isolating patients with SARS and implementing droplet precautions using surgical masks and contact precautions for all persons interacting with them are likely sufficient to prevent the transmission of SARS from these patients to others. However, despite the lack of definitive studies showing an involvement in transmission through fomites, routine environmental cleaning and disinfection also should be completed; 0% sodium hypochlorite, 75% ethanol, and 2% phenol have all been shown to inactivate SARS-CoV within 5 minutes [24] . In addition, because of potential for possible airborne transmission associated with aerosolgenerating procedures and because airborne transmission cannot be ruled out altogether in some cases occurring in the recent outbreak, the use of N95 respirators and negative pressure rooms (when available) is likely prudent until further studies better define the role of possible airborne transmission. Whether N95 respirators require fit-testing needs further study, as described earlier. In addition to the protective measures described earlier, given the reported cases of through-precautions transmissions, additional measures to reduce the opportunity of transmission also should be enforced. These include minimizing the number of health care workers and visitors permitted in the patient's room, minimizing the time spent by health care workers and visitors in the room and specifically minimizing the time spent in close contact with the patient, keeping to the side of the patient (out of direct droplet range), only having the most experienced personnel perform procedures on the patient, providing adequate medication to suppress cough and vomiting with the goal to minimize droplets produced from the patient, and avoiding transporting patients with SARS when possible. Furthermore, ensuring an adequate supply of protective equipment and providing intense training with regard to its appropriate use is important, as documented by Lau et al. [25\u2022] .",

Such measures were instituted in many of the countries involved in the recent outbreak, including China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada. However, given the limited understanding of transmission that existed at the beginning of the outbreak, in some areas of the world close and remote contacts of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with SARS were quarantined, as opposed to limiting quarantine to only close contacts of symptomatic patients with SARS, who are now appreciated as being the only contacts that have significant risk for acquiring the disease. In Taiwan, by the end of the epidemic, 131,132 people had been placed in quarantine, with failure to comply punishable by fines of $1765 to $8824 and incarceration of up to 2 years [46] . In Beijing, approximately 30,000 residents were quarantined in their homes or quarantine sites [47\u2022] . These numbers would be lower had quarantine been limited to only close contacts of symptomatic cases. In Beijing, by limiting quarantine in this way, the number of persons quarantined would have been reduced by approximately 66% [47\u2022] . Typically, quarantined persons were asked to stay where they were quarantined, wear surgical masks when near others, take their temperature two to three times a day, and seek medical attention promptly if they developed fever (\u2265 38\u00b0 C) or other symptoms compatible with SARS. Phone calls or visits from public health officials occurred regularly to check on the status of quarantined persons. The use of quarantine as a strategy in the control of infectious diseases is controversial given the ethical and legal issues regarding its negative associated impact on civil liberties. In addition, the effectiveness of quarantine has been questioned because of the difficulty of tracing all atrisk contacts and ensuring observance of the rules of quarantine in all quarantined persons. As a strategy in the control of SARS specifically, one could argue that the effectiveness of quarantine should be further questioned given the lack of evidence of transmission during the incubation period before the onset of symptoms. However, the role of quarantine is not only to prevent transmission dur-ing the incubation period, should that be associated with a particular infection, but it also can facilitate early detection and management of symptomatic cases by enforcing compliance with reporting the onset of symptoms. In Beijing, the effectiveness of quarantine is supported by the fact that no secondary transmission to relatives or other contacts was detected from any person who had SARS while quarantined [47\u2022] . Analysis has shown that restricting quarantine in Beijing to only those who had close contact with an actively ill patient with SARS would not have compromised its effectiveness [47\u2022] . The decision to implement quarantine needs to be made in conjunction with local public health authorities.",

Decisions need to be made regarding implementation of more drastic control measures, such as hospital-wide screening and visitor restriction, closing hospitals, removing exposed or symptomatic groups to designated hospitals, or managing exposed or symptomatic cohorts in place. All of these strategies were used in different circumstances in Singapore with positive effect [48] .

Given the threat of the return of SARS and the ongoing threat of other emerging infectious diseases, it is prudent to consider a general paradigm shift regarding the approach to potentially infectious persons. Implicit in this is the need to educate health care workers in addition to the general public. Health care \"new normal\" directives implemented in Ontario, Canada that suggest addressing all patients presenting with respiratory illness as potentially infectious until proven otherwise and that reinforce that ill health care workers should stay at home until they are well are an example of the implementation of this paradigm shift [49] . In addition, \"healthy habits\" posters directed at the general public and created by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia are an excellent example of the kind of basic health hygiene education that should be reinforced [50] . In so doing, the goal is to change the way that infectious diseases are managed in health care and by the public, in order to increase the emphasis on the prevention of transmission of such diseases, with the ultimate goal of possibly averting a worldwide outbreak of the next newly emerged infectious disease.",
