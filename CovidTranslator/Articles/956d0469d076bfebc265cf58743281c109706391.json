This powerful system is patterned with high-aspect ratio micropillars to enhance reporter probe binding. After surface modification and probe immobilization, CRISPR Cas12a/crRNA complex is injected into the fully enclosed system. With the presence of double-stranded DNA target, the CRISPR enzyme is activated and non-specifically cleaves the ssDNA reporters initially immobilized on the micropillars. This collateral cleavage releases fluorescence dyes into the assay, and the intensity is linearly proportional to the target DNA concentration ranging from 0.1 to 10 nM. Importantly, this system does not rely on traditional dye-quencher labeled probe thus eliminating the fluorescence background presented in the assay. Furthermore, our one-step detection protocol is performed at isothermal conditions (37\u00b0C) without using complicated and time-consuming off-chip probe hybridization and denaturation. This miniaturized and fully packed IMPACT chip demonstrates rapid, sensitive, and simple nucleic acid detection and is an ideal candidate for the next generation molecular diagnostic platform for point-of-care (POC) applications, responding to emerging and deadly pathogen outbreaks. author/funder.

            "text": "The widespread impact of the current coronavirus (COVID-19) is a striking indicator of the fact that the global community is struggling to battle infectious diseases. Failure to contain the virus early has resulted in an outbreak that has infected over 120,000 people with over 3,000 deaths. 1, 2 The USA CDC predicts that a nationwide epidemic is unavoidable. 3 The current situation highlights a urgent need for access to real-time detection that is accurate and effective to identify those infected so they can be properly quarantined and treated. 4, 5 An effective vaccine could be the best solution to contain epidemics. However, vaccines take a very long time to develop, as evidenced with the African swine fever virus (ASFV), which was initially discovered in 2018 but only had a preliminary vaccine announced in January of this year. 6 It took over an additional month to show its effectiveness in laboratory tests, and it still needs to be proven effective in the field. 7 Currently, there are no proven treatments for either COVID-19 or ASFV. Even if one were to be developed soon, it can take years to prove its effectiveness in clinical trials and mass produce the vaccine, not to mention distribute and administer it in affected areas. 8 To contain and prevent the spread of these contagious outbreaks, a rapid point-of-care (POC) testing device is essential. Current methods can take up to two days for tittering in a centralized laboratory in order to diagnose whether a sample contains the disease, and is not viable and inefficient when trying to isolate those infected and prevent them from spreading the disease to others. 9,10 In addition, the collected patient samples need to be sent to a centralized laboratory, leading to very long turnaround times and greatly limiting the number of people who could be tested and confirmed. 11 Strides have been made to develop POC detection methods which can be deployed in the field, and currently lab-on-chip (LOC) devices or simple test kits which involve real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) have emerged as one of the leading choices for meeting the desired criteria. 12 PCR is particularly sought after due to its ability to amplify the viral RNA/DNA from a few copies to billions. 13 It has also been shown to work with clinical samples in LOC devices with low volumes of both reagents and patient samples. 14 However, there have been many issues with implementing PCR test kits, such as a shortages in test kits and trained professional to use them, as well as potential inaccurate results from the kits. 15, 16 Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) provides an alternative to PCR amplification techniques for the detection of viral RNA/DNA. Certain Cas proteins, such as CRISPR-Cas12a, have been shown to be powerful in biological detection due to their ability to indiscriminately cut single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) after they are activated by a target DNA. 17 This is extremely useful when paired with \"reporter probes\" (ssDNA strands with a fluorescent dye and quencher attached to them), as the CRISPR complex can cleave the reporter probe and release the dye for fluorescence quantification. However, one of the issues with utilizing the CRISPR complex is the high fluorescence background signal associated in the sample as the quencher cannot fully quench the fluorescent dye.",

            "text": "Solid-phase detection assays have been developed as one potential solution to overcome this issue presented in the liquid phase. On the solid surface, reporter probes do not require a quencher since they are only measured in the liquid phase after degradation, thus no fluorescent signal will be detected without the target DNA present in the assay. However, an extended surface with a larger surface area is always needed to increase the probe binding capacity. It has been shown that these extended surface can increase the amount of probe binding, lower the detection limit of the target of interest, and extend the detection dynamic range. 18, 19 Here, we present a fully enclosed Integrated Micropillar Polydimethylsiloxane Accurate CRISPR Detection (IMPACT) system for nucleic acid target detection. The reporter probes were firstly immobilized in the enclosed channel and the CRISPR complex was pumped into the system for reaction (Fig. 1a) . Leveraging the high activity of CRISPR-Cas12a enzyme and the ability of micropillars to bind more reporter probes, we successfully detect double-stranded DNA target without background issues. In addition, the IMPACT chip requires low volumes of reagents, operates in a one-step detection fashion, and does not require complicated temperature control, making it ideal for POC applications. To prove the concept of the IMPACT chip for viral DNA detection, the target sequence selected for the crRNA was synthesized after a segment of the ASFV-SY18 genome (B646L). In the future, our device could work with any RNA or DNA based pathogens, such as the emerging COVID-19.",

            "text": "The IMPACT chip (Fig. 1b) consists of 6 cm long channels patterned with Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micropillars. Fig. 1c shows the SEM image of the channel, revealing periodic curved nature of the channel and even spacing of the micropillars (diameter: 100 \u00b5m; height: 120 \u00b5m). After channel fabrication and sealing, surface treatment with APTES (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane) and glutaraldehyde was performed for streptavidin immobilization. 20 After streptavidin coating, the static water contact angle decreases from ~105 degree to ~90 degree for a flat PDMS surface and ~138 degree to 110 degree for micropillar surface, respectively (Fig. 1d ). Fig. 1e shows the entire sample preparation and detection protocol. DNA reporter probes with a biotin label were conjugated on the streptavidin coated micropillars. CRISPR Cas12a complex was then introduced into the channel. With the presence of the ASFV target DNA, it cleaves the reporters from the micropillars for detection. The sequence of the DNA target and the crRNA are listed in Fig. 1f . The target was selected based on the PAM region in the ASFV-SY18 genome. 21 It has been shown that auto-fluorescence occurs from the chemical treatment of APTES and glutaraldehyde. 22 In our case, we were able to confirm the phenomenon was specific to glutaraldehyde and APTES ( Fig. SI 1a) , and use it to show that it only occurs on PDMS in the presence of these chemicals (Fig. SI 1b) . Fig. 1g shows the uniformity of the chemical treatment on the surface, as the intensity of the auto-fluorescence (emission: 525 nm) is uniform throughout. We then incubated the reporter probes (emission: 668 nm) in the channel for 3 hrs and showed uniform coating in the channel (Fig. 1h ).",

Then, the channel was evacuated, and the fluorescence intensity of the supernatant was immediately evaluated. After the first wash, a high fluorescence peak was observed for all the samples (inset of Fig. 2a) , indicating that excessive DNA probes were washed from the channel. A second wash was performed to confirm the unbounded DNA probes were completely removed from the channel. After the second wash, the collected supernatant barely shows any fluorescence peak. As shown in Fig. 2a , the integrated signal (490 to 700 nm) for the first supernatant ranges between ~8,000 to 9,000 counts, regardless of surface treatment conditions (Saturated the spectrometer due to high signal). On the other hand, the integrated signal for the second supernatant is only ~300 counts, eliminating the background caused by weakly bounded DNA probes. After washing, the bounded reporter probe was released by UV exposure and the results are presented in Fig. 2b .

As shown in Fig. 3 , for streptavidin coated surface, the number of DNA immobilized on the surface does not show significant change with an incubation time between 10 to 60 min as the integrated fluorescence intensity of the retrieved DNA ranges between 50,000 to 60,000 counts. However, the binding capacity increases ~25% with 3 hrs incubation when compared to 10 min incubation. Although the binding capacity further increases with 24 hrs incubation , it requires refrigeration as the streptavidin protein could denature at room temperature. On the other hand, the negative sample without streptavidin coating does not show a correlation to the incubation time, indicating less specific binding. Moreover, the negative sample always shows much lower fluorescence intensity than the positive sample. For example, with 3 hrs incubation, the retrieved DNA from positive sample is ~2.6 times higher than the negative sample. It further indicates that surface modification can enhance the probe binding capacity. Therefore, we used 3 hrs incubation to prepare the IMPACT chip for solid phase CRISPR detection.",

The cleaved CRISPR products are sent to a separate reservoir for detection thus completely avoiding the fluorescence background caused by the tradition \"onepot\" detection.

This is an important improvement for molecular diagnostics, especially in low light settings in which the amount of background fluorescence present can significantly affect the detection limit . 31,32 Leveraging this advantage with increasing the aspect ratio either with PDMS or a silicon substrate will be able to further increase the accuracy and robustness of the device and improve the limit of detection.",

The silicon wafer was first dehydrated by baking it at 200\u00b0C for 20 min on a hot plate. After cooling to room temperature, SU-8 2075 (Microchem) was spun coat onto the silicon wafer with a thickness of 120 \u00b5m.

After that, the wafer was exposed using a Karl Suss MA6 Mask Aligner for 15-20 s. It was then allowed to sit for 5 min, before receiving a post exposure bake at 80\u00b0C for 10 min. The sample was developed for ~10 min in SU-8 developer (MicroChem) and then sprayed down with IPA and dried. A final hard bake at 145\u00b0C was done on a hotplate for 5 min. After the hard bake, the wafer was silanized overnight using Silanization Solution I (~5% dimethyldichlorosilane in heptane) in a desiccator.",

The PDMS was then peeled from the SU-8 mold, and holes (diameter of 1 mm) were punched at both ends of the channels to allow for flow of reagents through the channel. The channels were then cleaned in an ultrasonic bath for 5 min using ethanol, dried, and then cleaned again in the same manner using deionized water. The PDMS slab was then bonded to a pre-cleaned glass substrate by treating both with oxygen plasma (Electro-technic products) for 2 min, followed by pressing the substrate and PDMS together. The device was immediately baked on a hotplate overnight at ~125\u00b0C.",
