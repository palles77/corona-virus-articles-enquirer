Little is known about the biology and pathophysiology of the novel coronavirus that causes SARS. The tissue and cellular distributions of coronaviral hypothetical and structural proteins in SARS were investigated. Antibodies against the hypothetical (SARS 3a, 3b, 6, 7a and 9b) and structural proteins (envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike) of the coronavirus were generated from predicted antigenic epitopes of each protein. The presence of these proteins were first verified in coronavirus-infected Vero E6 tissue culture model. Immunohistochemical studies on different human tissues, including a cohort of nine autopsies, two liver biopsies and intestinal biopsies of SARS patients, further confirmed the existence of coronaviral hypothetical and structural proteins in the cytoplasm of pneumocytes and small intestinal surface enterocytes in SARS patients. With this vast array of antibodies, no signal was observed in other cell types including those organs in which reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions were reported to be positive. Structural proteins and the functionally undefined hypothetical proteins were expressed in coronavirusinfected cells with distinct expression pattern in different organs in SARS patients. These antipeptide antibodies can be useful for the diagnosis of SARS at the tissue level.",

[6] [7] [8] The genome of SARS-CoV consists of a single giant positive-strand RNA that is approximately 29.7 kb in length. SARS-CoV genome encompasses two large open reading frames (ORFs) encoding nonstructural proteins involved in replication and 12 potential ORFs. These potential ORFs include four genes encoding structural proteins (envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid and spike proteins). The remaining potential ORFs encode hypothetical SARS-CoV-specific proteins that lack obvious sequence similarity to known proteins. 9, 10 These hypothetical proteins that are purely the prophecies of bioinformatics algorithm need to be studied in infected cells so as to confirm their identities. The functions of these hypothetical proteins and their roles in SARS pathogenesis remain obscure. 11, 12 In this study, we have generated specific antipeptide antibodies against each of the putative structural and hypothetical proteins of the SARS-CoV.",

The SARS-CoV proteins existed either in diffuse signals or in aggregates in the cytoplasm. Background in negative controls was minimal. Immunohistochemical staining was negative in the lung and intestinal sections from control autopsy and surgical specimens. The histopathology of the lung was dominated by diffuse alveolar damage at various stages of organization. No histological features appeared to predict the positivity of immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemical staining was performed on all available tissues from nine autopsy cases of clinically confirmed SARS, two intestine biopsies of SARS patients and two liver biopsies. Positive cytoplasmic signals were observed in pulmonary pneumocytes and small intestinal surface enterocytes only. The existence of SARS-CoV in immunohistochemical-positive cells was proven by colocalization of the expressed proteins and viral genome in the same cells by dual immunofluorescence-fluorescence in situ hybridization. Both the lung pneumocytes and small intestine enterocytes expressed the full sets of viral proteins. Although lung and small intestine were the primary targets of SARS-CoV infection, the responses of these two tissues were quite different. Tissue damage and organization, in the pattern of diffuse alveolar damage, were commonly observed in the lungs of SARS. 13, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Syncytial cell formation is rarely observed although characteristic. Little tissue reaction is, however, observed in the small intestine autopsy and biopsy sections. 5, 13 Detailed studies of the expression levels and the interactions of viral proteins with host proteome may provide the answer. Much interest has been diverted to the Figure 4 Immunofluorescence-fluorescence in situ hybridization of the hypothetical protein SARS 3a and SARS-CoV genome. SARS 3a (ii, green fluorescence) and viral genome (iii, red fluorescence) were detected using the antibody SARS AbS21a and a DNA-probe directed towards the M gene, respectively. The nuclei were counter-stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (iv).

The uniqueness of the hypothetical proteins to SARS-CoV, as compared phylogenetically to other known coronavirus, might be crucial to the clinical manifestation of SARS. At present, the functions of SARS-CoV hypothetical proteins and their roles in SARS pathogenesis are poorly understood. Recently, one of the putative proteins, SARS 7a was shown to interact with SARS 3a and the structural proteins in Vero E6. 11, 12 These findings highlighted the potential, undervalued functions of hypothetical proteins in the pathogenesis of SARS.",

            "text": "The negative immunohistochemical result in liver biopsies is interesting. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for the viral genome was positive while electron microscopy failed to demonstrate viral particles in the liver. 14, 22 In situ hybridization aiming at detecting the viral genome were all negative in these same specimens (result not shown). This might be due to the high sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction-based detection method that picked up the small number of viral genome in the scanty infected cells. Alternatively, serum contamination in the biopsy might explain the positive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. It is, however, important to note that liver dysfunction was observed in SARS patients. 14,23-25 A high proliferation index was clearly demonstrated in these liver biopsy specimens. 14 Hence, liver metabolism must have been perturbed in these patients. The role of cytokines or other yet unknown paracrine mediators in causing liver dysfunction requires further clarification. A similar scenario is likely happening in the kidneys of SARS patients in which 'sensitive' reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction is positive 22 with functional disturbances of the renal function, yet viral particles, proteins and genome were not identified. 26 We are beginning to understand how SARS-CoV enters its host cells. In various in vitro systems using the spike protein, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [27] [28] [29] and the C-type lectins, CD209 30 or CD209L, 31 are identified as receptors of SARS-CoV. The distribution of ACE2, by itself, cannot explain the tissue tropism of the virus. 26 The ACE2 protein has a much wilder cellular distribution 32 than even the most extensive, although putative and controversial, list of organs and cell types harboring the virus. 17 In the current study, the dendritic cells were not positive for IHC signals of any of the viral proteins in various different tissues. Lymphoid follicles immediately adjacent to infected cells were negative. SARS-CoV may exist only in low titer in the dendritic cells. Parallel to the situations in human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 33 the idea of dendritic cells as reservoir and immune mediator is attractive, the actual role of this cell type in SARS patients is not clear.",
