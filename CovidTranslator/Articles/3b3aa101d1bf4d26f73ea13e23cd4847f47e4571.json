When supplemented with isopropylthiogalactoside, E. eoli containing the pGEX-WllC5 construct accumulated soluble fusion protein to 20%-30% of cell protein as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Neville 1971) using Coomassie blue stain. The fusion protein was affinity-purified using glutathione bound to epoxy activated beaded agarose (Sigma; St. Louis, Mo., USA) essentially as described by Smith and Johnson (1988) . The yield was comparatively poor, as only a small proportion of the fusion protein bound to the affinity gel.

Moreover, negative sera reacted even without the prior addition of antigen to the microtitre plate. This was not related to haemolysis. Obviously, serum components recognised by the affinity-purified conjugate were adhering to the polystyrene surface. Different blocking agents, such as gelatin, hen-egg albumin, and horse serum, and inclusion of Tween 20 in the diluting buffer were evaluated for their ability to prevent this. Horse serum was best, but it produced only partial improvement. Because the non-specific reactions were also conjugate-dependent, a variety of different conjugates, conventional or affinity-purified, were tested. Although some conjugates were more suitable than others, none was entirely satisfactory.",

This moderate correlation was anticipated because the native antigen preparation contains a large number of different antigens, whereas the recombinant antigen represents only one of these B, boris antigens. Nevertheless, the single recombinant antigen enables the reliable detection of most infected cattle. Most naturally infected animals developed antibodies against this antigen, which indicated a high degree of conservation between parasite strains. The recombinant antigen ELISA remains at least as sensitive as the assays reported thus far (Table 1) but has the slight disadvantage of lower sensitivity in some cases. This could probably be overcome by use of a cocktail of two or more recombinant a 4 cattle were infected with B. boris as detected by thick blood-film examination, 5 were of unknown parasilological status b 2 cattle were infected with B. boris as detected by thick blood-film examination, 9 were calves about 7 months old, held in a herd in which all cattle over the age of 1 year were sero-positive antigens, which would presumably also lead to a closer correlation with the native antigen ELISA. Interestingly, the recombinant antigen detected some cattle that were not positive by the native antigen EL-ISA; 2 of these 1 t cattle were infected with B. boris, whereas the remaining 9 calves were probably positive due to maternal antibodies (Table 2) . Colostral antibodies against B. boris have been detected for as long as 68 days by HA (Goodger and Mahoney 1974 ) and for as long as 6 months after birth by radioimmunoassay (Wright 1990) . Transferred antibodies against B. bigernina can be detected by IFAT as long as 170 days after colostrum intake (Weisman et al. 1974) . Given the high sensitivity of the ELISA, it is likely that the marginally positive reactions are due to maternal antibodies. Nevertheless, only the examination of a series of blood samples from calves with maternal antibodies could prove this interpretation.",
