A plasma sample can be submitted to measure an antibody titer against CDV. However, because both infected and vaccinated ferrets can have a positive titer, a positive result is not diagnostic of disease. In practical terms, if a ferret that has not been vaccinated has a positive titer, this test can confirm CDV infection. A fluorescent antibody test can be done on conjunctival smears, mucous membrane scrapings, or blood smears to identify CDV antigen in cells. 21 However, this test is useful only in the first few days of disease, and false-negative results are possible. Modified live viral strains used for vaccination do not interfere with this test. 57 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been developed and may be used for ante-or postmortem diagnosis. Recent research suggests that nested PCR assays are more sensitive for antemortem diagnosis than reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). 30, 51 Samples of blood, urine, feces, or tissues or deep pharyngeal swabs should be submitted to commercial laboratories for CDV PCR testing. False-positive results may be seen in the first few weeks after vaccination with modified live vaccines. Killed and vector-recombinant vaccines do not interfere with PCR testing.",

Inclusions are generally found in the epithelial cells of the trachea, urinary bladder, skin, gastrointestinal tract, lymph nodes, spleen, and salivary glands. 21 Diffuse interstitial pneumonia may be present. In the central nervous system, inflammatory cell invasion with demyelination is observed. 2 History of exposure and clinical signs can be highly suggestive of infection. Nonspecific test results can include leukopenia, alpha-and beta-hyperglobulinemia, and radiographic evidence of lung congestion or consolidation. 21, 44, 57 Nonregenerative anemia and increased serum levels of alpha and beta globulins are the most common routine laboratory changes. 44 Clinical signs of infection with CDV can initially resemble those of influenza. However, within 1 to 2 days, the nasal and ocular discharge turns from serous to mucopurulent, and dermatitis develops around the chin and lips. When it is present with other clinical signs typical of CDV, this dermatitis is pathognomonic for CDV infection. Also, ferrets infected with CDV tend to be much sicker than those with influenza.",

However, CDV vaccines are insufficient to induce protection in very young ferrets because of interference from maternal antibodies acquired via colostrum in the first few days of life. Because CDV is closely related to MV, vaccination with MV vaccine may offer cross protection at 5 to 6 weeks of age without interference from maternal antibodies. 64 Otherwise, CDV vaccinations may be started at 6 or 8 weeks of age for kits from nonimmune or immune dams, respectively, and then continued every 3 to 4 weeks until the kits are at least 12 to 14 weeks old. At present, the recommendation is to revaccinate yearly. However, results of currently ongoing research demonstrate that antibody titers may remain high for several years, suggesting that boosters could be given less frequently. In other species, titers of 1:32 are considered protective, and in a clinical trial involving 66 CDV-vaccinated ferrets, average antibody titers were found to be over 1:1000 a year postvaccination (HL Heller, 2009, personal communication).",

If a reaction occurs, treat the ferret for anaphylactic shock with epinephrine, parenteral fluids, steroids, antihistamines, and oxygen therapy as needed. It is prudent to suggest that a ferret owner remain in the hospital for up to 30 minutes after CDV vaccination in case a reaction should occur. PureVax ferret distemper vaccine is a recombinant canarypox vector vaccine that appears to be less likely to cause anaphylaxis. A possible link between myofasciitis and distemper vaccination has been suggested. 22 If an outbreak of CDV occurs in a group of susceptible ferrets, all affected animals should be removed and the healthy ferrets vaccinated immediately. However, vaccinating nonimmunized ferrets may not stop infection and subsequent death in the face of an outbreak. 21 CDV is relatively labile and its infectivity is destroyed by heat, drying, detergents, and disinfectants. 57 Routine cleaning and disinfection procedures effectively destroy CDV on hard surfaces.",

Experimentally, an enzyme-liked immunosorbent assay can detect antibodies against influenza A and can be used to rapidly establish a serologic diagnosis. 10 Antibodies against influenza virus have been detected within 3 days after infection. 38, 41 More recently, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and in-clinic antigen detection assays like Directigen Flu (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), have become available and are able to differentiate between human influenza types A and B with a simple nasopharyngeal swab taken within the first 48 to 72 hours after clinical signs develop.

            "text": "Influenza has a 7-to 14-day course in adult ferrets and is associated with a low mortality rate. Most ferrets can be treated at home. Instruct owners to offer favorite foods, chicken or beef broth, or specialized diets (e.g., Carnivore Care, Oxbow Animal Health, Murdock, NE; Eukanuba Maximum-Calorie, The Iams Company, Dayton, OH). Force-feed and offer water by syringe as needed. If pneumonia is not a complicating factor, use a pediatric cough suppressant without alcohol (at the pediatric dosage on a per weight basis). Also a bronchodilator, such as aminophylline (4 mg/kg PO, IM q12h), may be used for symptomatic therapy. As with any flu patient, parenteral fluids to maintain hydration and antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections may be indicated. To relieve nasal congestion, intranasal delivery of phenylephrine can be effective. 7 The antiviral medication amantadine (6 mg/kg PO q12h) (Symmetrel; ENDO Pharmaceuticals, Chadds Ford, PA) has been experimentally effective in treating ferrets with influenza, although resistance in humans is widely reported. 15 Other antiviral medications include neuraminidase inhibitors like zanamivir (12.5 mg/kg as a one-time intranasal dose) (Relenza; GlaxoSmith Kline, Research Triangle Park, NC), and oseltamivir (5 mg/kg PO q12h \u00d7 10 days) (Tamiflu; Roche, Nutley, NJ). These have been shown to prevent and treat influenza infection and either agent may be used to greater effect in combination with amantadine. 4, 19, 28 However, resistance to oseltamivir appears to be emerging among some influenza strains. 52 Because ferrets are a good model with which to study influenza infection in people, they are frequently used in experimental studies to develop new anti-influenza drugs. 63 Anti-influenza drugs used in humans may therefore be used to treat pet ferrets. Antibiotics can be used to control secondary bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. In neonates, death typically results from secondary bacterial infections; antibiotic therapy may thus reduce neonate mortality. 25 The use of antipyretic drugs to control fever is of questionable merit because fever is an important host defense mechanism. In one study, ferrets given aspirin had lowered body temperature, but they shed more virus and their viral levels decreased less rapidly than those of ferrets not treated with an antipyretic. 26 In a recent meta-analysis of the use of antipyretics in animal models of influenza virus, risk of mortality increased with the use of antipyretics (aspirin, paracetamol, and diclofenac). 17 This suggests that fever is instrumental in restricting the severity of infection. 26, 53 PREVENTION Controlling influenza rests mainly on preventing exposure of susceptible ferrets to infected individuals. Newborn ferrets are protected from disease by milk-derived antibodies in immunized dams. 27 Experimentally, ferrets remain resistant to infection from the same influenza strain 5 weeks after primary infection. 21 Vaccinating ferrets against influenza virus is not generally recommended for several reasons. Influenza is a relatively benign disease in ferrets, and the wide antigenic variation of the virus makes vaccination difficult. Also, vaccination seems to confer only short-term immunity. 21 However, if a vaccine is being given, the use of a live or recombinant rather than an inactivated vaccine should be considered, because they may induce a greater protective effect. 18, 33 PNEUMONIA Pneumonia is not a common diagnosis in ferrets. Viral causes of pneumonia include CDV and influenza virus. Aleutian disease virus, a parvovirus, is associated with interstitial pneumonia in mink kits 1 and should be considered as a possible cause of pneumonia and dyspnea in ferrets, especially the young. 60 Respiratory syncytial virus has been shown to cause rhinitis and infection in the lungs of ferrets, but clinical signs of pneumonia have not been seen. 47 Pyogranulomatous pneumonia has recently been reported in association with a systemic coronavirus infection in ferrets; it appears to produce a disease syndrome similar to the dry form of feline infectious peritonitis (see Chapter 3). 23, 37, 45 Bacterial pneumonia (Fig. 6-2) is characterized by a suppurative inflammatory process that affects the bronchial tree, the lung lobes, or both. Reported primary bacterial pathogens that cause pneumonia in ferrets are Streptococcus zooepidemicus, other streptococcal species, and numerous mycobacterial species. 12, 32, 50, 61 Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have been isolated from ferrets. 20 Other bacteria that have been isolated from the lungs of ferrets include Bordetella bronchiseptica and Listeria monocytogenes.",

After the history and physical examination, chest and abdominal radiography is the most important tool to differentiate the causes of lower respiratory tract symptoms. Ferrets that have severe traumatic injuries, such as from a fall from a great height, can develop pneumothorax or diaphragmatic hernia. These animals should be managed as one would a dog or cat with the same injuries. Ferrets with heartworm disease often present with coughing and tachypnea as the only clinical signs, even with moderate worm burdens (see Chapter 5) (Fig. 6-4) . ",
