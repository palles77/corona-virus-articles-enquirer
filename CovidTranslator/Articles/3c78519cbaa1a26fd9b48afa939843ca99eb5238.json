            "text": "Nucleoside analogues need to be in vivo phosphorylated to their triphosphates to display antiviral activity. 1 The first step of this three-step phosphorylation sequence, leading to the corresponding monophosphates, is essential for their activity. Low activity of nucleoside analogues may often result from poor in vivo monophosphorylation. To circumvent this problem, acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (ANPs), that is, derivatives with a phosphonate P-C-Olinkage instead of a phosphoester P-O-C one, were developed. 2 Since ANPs are stable analogues of nucleoside monophosphates, in contrast to the 'classical' acyclic nucleoside analogues (such as acyclovir, ganciclovir or penciclovir), 1 they do not require activation by the first phosphorylation. 3 Moreover, the presence of the phosphonate group makes ANPs resistant towards phosphomonoesterases and nucleotidases, enzymes involved in nucleotide catabolism. Owing to the specific mode of action, ANPs enhance a broad spectrum of antiviral activity. 3 Several of them (i.e., cidofovir, adefovir, and tenofovir, Fig. 1 ) have been approved for the treatment of viral infections. 3 However the therapeutic use of the ANP drugs is limited by poor oral bioavailability, potential nephrotoxicity or development of resistant viral strains. 3 In attempts to overcome these problems, a variety of structural analogues were synthesized and biologically evaluated. 4 Among them, compounds with the aza function at the 1 0 -, 3 0 -, or 4 0 -position of the acyclic moiety ( Fig. 1 , analogues 1, 2 and 3, respectively) 5 as well as N-(phosphonomethyl)prolinol derivatives 4 6 ( Fig. 1 ) have also been developed. Among the synthesized derivatives, compounds 2 (B = Gua or Cyt) were endowed with a weak anti-herpes virus activity. 5a These findings inspired us to evaluate the antiviral activity of compounds 8 (Scheme 1) being phosphonomethyl ethers of the previously reported, antivirally inactive N-(2-hydroxyethyl) azanucleosides. 7c Considering a unique mode of action of ANPs, we decided to examine the effect of the O-phosphonomethyl modification of the parent hydroxy derivatives on their antiviral activity. Compounds 8 can be regarded as aza-congeners of cidofovir. Taking into account the location of the aza function at the 2 0 -position of the side chain, they can be also considered as complementary to the abovementioned 1 0 -, 3 0 -, and 4 0 -aza analogues of the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates.",

            "text": "Generally, the synthetic approaches reported for the aforementioned acyclic aza-analogues 1-3 ( Fig. 1 ) involved two key steps: (a) transformation of a nucleobase into the corresponding N-amino-or N-aminoalkyl derivative; and (b) alkylation (or acylation) of the resultant precursor at the exocyclic amino group with a specific synthon bearing a dialkylphosphoryl function, followed by deprotection of the intermediate phosphonate esters. 5 Our strategy for the synthesis of the target 2 0 -azanucleosides 8 is outlined in Scheme 1. Based on our previous experience in synthesizing 0968 nucleoside aza-analogues, 7 we decided to achieve compounds 8 via simultaneous introduction of the aza and dialkylphosphoryl function to the nucleobase in one reaction step, that is, by N-alkylation of the nucleobase with the phosphonylated N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)sulfonamide 7 under Vorbr\u00fcggen's conditions. Synthesis of N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)sulfonamide 7 from diethyl (2-mesyloxyethoxy)methylphosphonate 8 5 or diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate 6 is shown in Scheme 2. Starting from diethyl (2-mesyloxyethoxy)methylphosphonate 5, the p-toluenesulfonylamino function of 7 was introduced by two methods [Scheme 2, conditions (i)-(iii) or (iv)]. The first one involved the following steps: (i) transformation of 5 into azide 9 using sodium azide at room temperature; 9 (ii) reduction of 9 to amine 10 under Staudinger's conditions; 9 and (iii) N-sulfonation of 10 with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride; the overall yield of 11 was 59%. The second method [conditions (iv)], that is, direct reaction of 5 with p-toluenesulfonamide in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate, afforded 11 in 68% yield. We also tried to prepare 11 by reaction of diethyl hydroxymethylphosphonate 6 with N-(p-toluenesulfonyl)aziridine 10 12 in the presence of sodium hydride [conditions (v) ]. However, this approach was not satisfactory; 11 was obtained in a low yield of 23%. In the next step [conditions (vi)], N-alkylation of 11 with chloromethyl pivalate in the presence of anhydrous potassium carbonate gave N-(pivaloyloxymethyl)sulfonamide 7 in a high yield of 96%. Reaction of 7 with the pyrimidine nucleobases (thymine, 5-fluorouracil or uracil) was performed according to the one-pot base silylation/nucleoside coupling procedure using N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BSA) as the silylating agent and tin(IV) chloride as the Lewis acid [Scheme 3, conditions (i)]. The thymine derivative 13a and the 5-fluorouracil derivative 13b were obtained as the only products in a yield of 83% and 55%, respectively. The only exception was the reaction of 7 with uracil; the desired azanucleoside 13c (the major product, 73%) and 1,3disubstituted uracil 14 (7%) were obtained. The minor product 14 was readily separated by column chromatography. Coupling of 7 with N 4 -benzoylcytosine under the same conditions, followed by treatment of the crude product (not shown) with ammonium hydroxide gave the cytosine derivative 13d in 80% yield [Scheme 3, conditions (ii) ].",

Structure and purity of derivatives 8a-c was verified by standard NMR and IR techniques as well as by elemental analysis. In contrast to 8a-c, solubility of the cytosine derivative 8d in water (5 mg/ca. 100 ml of water) and in conventional organic solvents, including dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide, was very low. For this reason, only IR spectrum and elemental analysis was performed for 8d. Therefore, in an attempt to transform 8d into the corresponding sodium salt, a suspension of 8d in a water/DMSO mixture was shaken with DOWEX \u00d2 88 ion-exchange resin (Na-form). Contrary to our expectation that 8d would gradually dissolve upon the treatment with the ion-exchange resin, the suspension (which was then identified by elemental analysis as the unchanged 8d) was still observed. Therefore, the time of shaking was prolonged for six months. Nevertheless, the conversion of 8d to its sodium salt was not satisfactory. Filtration of the unchanged 8d and evaporation of the solvents from the filtrate afforded a small amount of a solid (8ds, 15 mg from 50 mg of 8d) which was identified by elemental analysis as an equimolar mixture of 8d and its monosodium salt (not shown). The 1 H NMR spectrum of the mixture allowed us to confirm the structure of 8d. Unfortunately, solubility of 8d-s in DMSO or in water was too low to measure the 13 C NMR spectrum.",

This lack of antiviral activity may be due to the poor cell membrane permeability of the free phosphonic acids 8, resulting from the polarity of the phosphono group. 2 Considering the fact that masking of the phosphono group with a lipophilic function decreases the polarity of ANPs, 2,11 we have undertaken research on such modification of 8.

The antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa) or MTT dye staining of virus-infected feline kidney (CRFK) cell cultures. Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID50 of virus (1CCID50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures), or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (for VZV) or with 100 PFU (for HCMV). After a 1-2 h adsorption period, residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.",

The cytostatic concentration was calculated as the CC 50 , or the compound concentration required to reduce cell proliferation by 50% relative to the number of cells in the untreated controls. CC 50 values were estimated from graphic plots of the number of cells (percentage of control) as a function of the concentration of the test compounds.
