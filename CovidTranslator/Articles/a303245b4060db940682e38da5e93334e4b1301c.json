Following the demonstration of RNAi in mammalian cells in 2001, it was quickly realized that this highly specific mechanism of sequence-specific gene silencing might be harnessed to develop a new class of drugs that interfere with disease-causing or disease-promoting genes. Here we discuss the considerations that go into developing RNAi-based therapeutics starting from in vitro lead design and identification, to in vivo pre-clinical drug delivery and testing. We conclude by reviewing the latest clinical experience with RNAi therapeutics.",

The discovery of long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) mediated RNAi in the worm 1 and the subsequent demonstration that RNAi, mediated by small-interfering RNA (siRNA), operates in mammalian cells 2 sparked an explosion of research to uncover new mechanisms of gene silencing, revolutionizing our understanding of endogenous mechanisms of gene regulation and providing powerful new tools for biological research and drug discovery. From the first in vivo evidence of RNAi-based therapeutic efficacy in an animal disease model in 2003 (REF. 3 ), the pace of drug development has been rapid. Three phase I studies to investigate RNAibased drugs for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness, and for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the leading cause of paediatric hospitalizations in the United States today, have already been completed without untoward toxicity. Despite the promise, real hurdles need to be overcome to translate the therapeutic potential of RNAi into clinical reality. An important milestone will be the clear demonstration of efficacy in well-controlled human clinical studies.",

            "text": "RNAi pathways are guided by small RNAs that include siRNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs), with the latter deriving from imperfectly paired non-coding hairpin RNA structures that are naturally transcribed by the genome 4, 5 . Gene silencing can be induced by siRNA through sequence-specific cleavage of perfectly complementary messenger RNA (mRNA), whereas microRNAs mediate translational repression and transcript degradation for imperfectly complementary targets (FIG. 1) . In the endogenous pathway, RNAs containing stem loops or short hairpin structures, encoded in intragenic regions or within introns, are processed in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm as precursor molecules called pre-microRNAs 5, 6 . In the cytoplasm, the pre-microRNA is further shortened and processed by an RNAse III enzyme called Dicer to produce an imperfectly matched, double-stranded microRNA. Dicer similarly processes long, perfectly matched dsRNA into siRNA (FIG. 1) . A multienzyme complex, which includes Argonaute 2 (AGO2, also known as EIF2C2) and the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), binds to either the microRNA duplex or the siRNA duplex and discards one strand (it is thought the passenger or sense strand is cleaved in the case of siRNA and is released in the case of miRNA) to form an activated complex containing the guide or antisense strand 7 . The activated AGO2-RISC complex then seeks and binds to an mRNA strand bearing a complementary sequence and inactivates its expression. If complementarity is less than perfect (such as with miRNA), the AGO2-RISC complex blocks translation. If complementarity is perfect or nearly perfect (such as with siRNA) the complex cleaves the mRNA strand between the nucleotides that are complementary to nucleotides 10 and 11 of the guide strand relative to the 5\u2032-end (FIG. 1) . In addition to translational repression, miRNAs may also mediate mRNA degradation in cytoplasmic compartments known as processing bodies (P-bodies) 8 . Gene silencing by mRNA cleavage is thought to be particularly potent, in part because mRNA cleavage leads to rapid nucleolytic degradation of the RNA fragments and frees the activated RISC complex to seek and destroy another target mRNA in a catalytic fashion 9 .",

It is possible to harness the endogenous pathway in one of two ways: either by using a viral vector to express short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that resembles micro-RNA precursors, or by introducing siRNAs that mimic the Dicer cleavage product into the cytoplasm. These siRNAs can bypass the earlier steps in the RNAi silencing pathway and can be loaded directly onto the AGO2-RISC complex. Although delivery of synthetic siRNA and viral delivery of shRNA are being developed as potential RNAi-based therapeutic approaches, this article focuses solely on the development of synthetic siRNA as drugs. Synthetic siRNAs harness the naturally occurring RNAi pathway in a manner that is consistent and predictable, thus making them particularly attractive as therapeutics. Moreover, as they enter the RNAi pathway later, siRNAs are less likely to interfere with gene regulation by endogenous microRNAs 10 . As a consequence, siRNAs are the class of RNAi therapeutics that are most advanced in preclinical and clinical studies.",

Two types of off-target effects need to be avoided or minimized: silencing of genes sharing partial homology to the siRNA, and immune stimulation stemming from the recognition of certain siRNAs by the innate immune system. As our understanding of the molecular and structural mechanism of RNAi has grown, the issues around lead siRNA selection are better understood and the off-target effects can generally be mitigated.

RNAi can be activated in mammalian cells by introducing siRNAs that mimic Dicer-cleaved, endogenous microRNAs. siRNAs can be identified to silence any gene, often with in vitro activity at nanomolar or lower concentrations. Algorithms to predict effective siRNAs, based on common features of siRNAs identified by empirical testing, are available on the web 11, 12 . Although algorithms can increase the chances of identifying active siRNA, they are imperfect and can sometimes miss the most potent siRNAs, which can only be identified by experimental testing. An alternative to using algorithms as a starting point to identify candidate siRNAs, is to test all the tiled 21 nucleotide sequences from the mRNA coding region experimentally and select a group of candidates that induce effective silencing at the lowest concentrations. One study suggests that slightly longer siRNAs, which need to be processed by Dicer before they can be incorporated into RISC, can be used as Dicer substrates and maintain silencing activity, although these longer siRNAs are more complicated to synthesize and could have an increased propensity to activate untoward immune responses 13, 14 . Loading of RISC with respect to the sense and antisense siRNA strands is not symmetrical [15] [16] [17] . The strand that is least tightly bound at its 5\u2032-end is favoured to bind to a deep pocket in RISC and become the active strand. Strand selection can in fact be manipulated by making a single nucleotide substitution at the end of the duplex to alter the relative binding of the ends 15 . By designing an siRNA with a mismatch at the 5\u2032-end of the intended active strand that favours its incorporation into RISC, it may be possible to increase the likelihood of identifying a potent duplex.",

Nevertheless, siRNAs also recognize and interfere with the expression of mRNAs that share partial homology with the target mRNA. In vitro transcriptional profiling has shown that siRNAs can alter the mRNA levels of off-target genes in addition to the intended target gene but usually the changes are less than threefold [19] [20] [21] . An accurate assessment of off-target silencing would require detailed proteomic analyses to identify these genes. The tools for unbiased analysis of protein expression are less developed at present and have not been applied to examine off-target silencing. Not surprisingly, many of the off-target genes that have reduced mRNA levels contain regions that are complementary to one of the two strands in the siRNA duplex [19] [20] [21] . Complementarity between the 5\u2032-end of the guide strand and the mRNA is key to off-target silencing with the critical nucleotides being in positions If the RNA duplex loaded onto RISC has perfect sequence complementarity, AGO2 cleaves the passenger (sense) strand so that active RISC containing the guide (antisense) strand is produced. The siRNA guide strand recognizes target sites to direct mRNA cleavage (carried out by the catalytic domain of AGO2). RNAi therapeutics developed to harness the siRNA pathway typically involve the delivery of synthetic siRNA into the cell cytoplasm. The microRNA pathway begins with endogenously encoded primary microRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and are processed by the Drosha enzyme complex to yield precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). These precursors are then exported to the cytoplasm by exportin 5 and subsequently bind to the Dicer enzyme complex, which processes the pre-miRNA for loading onto the AGO2-RISC complex. When the RNA duplex loaded onto RISC has imperfect sequence complementarity, the passenger (sense) strand is unwound leaving a mature miRNA bound to active RISC.

REF two to eight (from the 5\u2032-end of the guide strand) or the so-called 'seed region' for microRNA recognition of endogenous target mRNAs 22, 23 (FIG. 2) . Accordingly, one approach for minimizing off-target effects is the careful design of siRNA to minimize exact seed pairings, although seed regions of seven nucleotides are very short in length. Alternatively, chemical modifications of riboses in the guide strand can suppress most off-target effects, while maintaining target-mRNA silencing 24, 25 . In particular, a single 2\u2032-O-methyl modification at nucleotide 2 suppresses off-target silencing without significantly interfering with on-target silencing. Thus, bioinformatics design and/or position-specific, sequence-independent chemical modifications can be used to reduce sequence-related off-target effects while maintaining efficient target-mRNA silencing. siRNA can also induce potential unwanted effects by activating the innate immune response, setting off defence systems usually used to combat viruses. One pathway involves recognition of dsRNAs by the serine/ threonine protein kinase PKR (reviewed in REF. 26 ). This pathway is efficiently triggered only by dsRNAs that are more than 30 nucleotides long. At higher concentrations, however, smaller siRNAs may be able to activate this pathway, resulting in global translational blockade and cell death. Perhaps of more concern is the potential to activate Toll-like receptors (TLRs), especially the dsRNA receptor TLR7 in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, to trigger the production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and induce nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation 27 . In much the same way that certain CpG motifs in antisense oligonucleotides mediate TLR9 immunostimulation, interferon induction by some siRNAs occurs principally through TLR7, which is largely found in endosomes of immune antigen-presenting cells. Fortunately, TLR7 binding is sequence specific, favouring GU-rich sequences, and can be avoided by choosing sequences that are not recognized by this receptor. Additional work is required to identify immunostimulatory motifs and determine whether other receptors might also be involved. Several approaches exist to circumvent the immunostimulatory properties of certain siRNA duplexes. Candidate duplexes can be transfected into plasmacytoid dendritic cells to test whether they induce interferon expression 27, 28 ; those that do can be discarded. Moreover, the presence of 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications within the siRNA duplex can be used to abrogate TLR7 binding and abolish immunostimulatory activity 27, 29 . These modifications also reduce sequence-dependent off-target silencing and may be particularly beneficial in enhancing siRNA target specificity. Potentially, TLR7 signalling could also be evaded by using siRNA delivery strategies that avoid the cell types responsible for immune stimulation or that transport the siRNA directly to the cytoplasm, thereby avoiding TLR activation in the endosome.",

To convert siRNAs into optimized drugs, the chemical modifications that prolong siRNA half-life without jeopardizing biological activity have been investigated in detail. The starting point for these efforts has been chemistries that are already in use with antisense oligonucleotide and aptamer therapeutics. For instance, the introduction of a phosphorothioate (P=S) backbone linkage at the 3\u2032-end protects against exonuclease degradation, and 2\u2032-sugar modification (such as 2\u2032-O-methyl or 2\u2032-fluoro) provides endonuclease resistance [30] [31] [32] [33] (FIG. 2) . With respect to maintaining RNAi silencing activity, exonuclease-stabilizing modifications are well tolerated. Introduction of internal sugar modifications to protect against endonucleases is also generally tolerated but can depend on the location of the modification within the duplex; the sense strand being more amenable to modification than the antisense strand. Nevertheless, using simple, well-described modifications such as P=S, 2\u2032-O-methyl and 2\u2032-fluoro it is possible, in most instances, to stabilize an siRNA duplex while maintaining silencing activity. The minimal modifications required to stabilize a particular siRNA duplex can be identified by studying its degradation fragments in the plasma, thereby avoiding the toxicities associated with certain oligonucleotide chemistries and minimizing changes that could reduce activity.",

When siRNAs are formulated into different carrier systems for in vivo delivery they may be protected from nuclease digestion and last longer than naked siRNAs. Improved nuclease-stability is especially important for siRNA duplexes that are exposed to nuclease-rich environ ments (such as blood) and that are formulated using excipients that do not themselves confer additional nuclease protection. As might be expected in these situations, nuclease-stabilized siRNAs show improved pharmacokinetic properties in vivo 34 . In other situations, when delivering siRNA directly to less nuclease-rich sites, such as the lung, or when delivering siRNA in conjunction with delivery agents such as liposomes, the degree of nuclease stabilization can be reduced significantly. Although the ability of an siRNA duplex to reach its target cell intact is vitally important, whether nuclease protection confers a measurable benefit once an siRNA is inside This three-step process begins with in silico design and in vitro screening of target siRNAs, is followed by incorporating stabilizing chemical modifications on lead siRNAs as required, and ends with the selection and in vivo evaluation of delivery technologies that are appropriate for the target cell type/organ and the disease setting. A schematic illustration of the important features of siRNA structure (two base pair overhangs, seed region and mRNA cleavage site) is shown. An example of an optimized siRNA molecule that incorporates chemical modifications to increase nuclease stability and to minimize off-targeting is shown below.

Much progress has been made in understanding what attributes identify an active and stable siRNA in vitro, but much less is known about how well those attributes translate into in vivo activity. Most of our knowledge on siRNA specificity is based only on in vitro data. Furthermore, the range of off-target genes identified in tissue culture can differ dramatically depending on the transfection method used to introduce siRNAs into cells and the mRNA expression profile of the target cell 37 . Likewise, induction of innate immune responses by certain siRNAs is cell-type specific 14 .

The challenges of local, direct delivery have been elucidated for some tissue sites, and locally delivered siRNAs are being tested in ongoing clinical studies in the eye for AMD and in the lung for RSV infection (see the clinical trials section for details). Local delivery or 'direct RNAi' has the advantage that, as for any drug, the dose of siRNA required for efficacy is substantially lower when injected into or administered at, or near, the target tissue. Direct delivery might also reduce any undesired systemic side effects. Systemic delivery of siRNA to target tissues deep within the body remains challenging although there have been some recent successes in animal models.

It is not understood why certain cells, but not others, can directly take up siRNAs into the cytoplasm where the RNAi machinery operates. As used here, the term 'naked' siRNA refers to the delivery of siRNA (unmodified or modified) in saline or other simple excipients, such as 5% dextrose (D5W). The ease of formulation and administration using direct delivery of naked siRNA to tissues make this an attractive therapeutic approach. Not surprisingly, the initial development of RNAi therapeutics has focused on disease targets and clinical indications (such as AMD and RSV infection) that allow for direct administration of siRNA to the diseased organ.",

However, the required dose or delivery to certain cell types in the lung for some indications might be improved by incorporating the siRNA into carriers. In one study, intranasal instillation of siRNAs (either unformulated or complexed with the transfection agent Transit-TKO) directed against viral genes reduced the viral load of RSV and parainfluenza virus, two relevant pathogens in paediatric and immunocompromised patients, by more than three orders of magnitude, using doses of siRNA as low as 70 \u03bcg per animal with no observed adverse events 44 . Other pathological features of RSV infection such as elevated leukotriene levels, pulmonary inflammation and clinical signs of respiratory distress were also reduced after siRNA administration. Protection could be achieved in both prophyl axis and treatment paradigms. Similarly, siRNA formulated in D5W adminis tered intranasally in a nonhuman primate model of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus infection significantly reduced interstitial infiltrates and pathological changes, and inhibited viral replication in the lung 45 .

Through conjugation, the therapeutic can be fixed as a single compound, reducing the complexity from a chemical, manufacturing and regulatory perspective. Conjugation is especially attractive for siRNA-based drugs as only one of the strands in the duplex is active and conjugates can be attached to the sense or passenger strand without disrupting the activity of the active antisense strand. Conjugates can be placed on either the 5\u2032-or 3\u2032-end of the sense strand, although in some instances they can also be tolerated on the 3\u2032-end of the 59 . c | Aptamer-siRNA conjugates silence target genes in tumour cells following local injection in a tumour xenograft model 64 . d | Liposome-formulated delivery of siRNA has been used to silence multiple targets following systemic administration [69] [70] [71] 73 . The composition of a stable nucleic acid-lipid particle (SNALP) is shown. Cationic lipids aid formulation, cellular uptake and endosomal release. Fusogenic lipids also function in endosomal release. Polyethylene glycosylated (PEG) lipids stabilize the formulation, regulate fusogenicity and shield surface charges. Cholesterol also helps to stabilize the formulation. Other cationic liposome formulations exist which may or may not contain a fusogenic or PEG lipid. The ratios of different components can vary between formulations. e | Antibody-protamine fusion proteins have been used to non-covalently bind siRNAs through charge interactions and to deliver siRNA specifically to cells that express the surface receptor that is recognized by the antibody 101, 102 . The passenger strand and the guide strand are represented in blue and orange, respectively. antisense strand. To date, siRNA conjugates have been made using lipophilic molecules, proteins, peptides and aptamers. Conjugation to cholesterol, previously used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides to the liver 58 , has been adapted to achieve effective in vivo silencing by siRNAs 59 . Intravenous injection of siRNA duplexes conjugated to cholesterol at the 5\u2032-end of the passenger strand targeting apolipoprotein B (ApoB) in mice silenced ApoB mRNA by ~55% in the liver and ~70% in the jejunum, the two main sites of ApoB expression. Concomitantly, ApoB plasma protein dropped by ~70% and serum cholesterol fell by 35-40%, consistent with the biological function of ApoB in binding cholesterol. Cholesterol conjugation was critical for improved pharmacokinetics and in vivo cellular uptake as the unconjugated ApoB siRNA was rapidly cleared and inactive. However, these experiments required a relatively high dose (50 mg per kg) of siRNA. Cholesterol conjugation has been reported to prolong circulating half-life by incorporating the cholesterol-siRNA conjugate into circulating lipoprotein particles that are resistant to filtration by the kidney and may also provide protection from plasma nucleases. The siRNA-containing lipoprotein complexes are endocytosed through cholesterol receptors present on all cells (M. Stoffel, personal communication).",

These include membrane permeant peptides such as penetratin and transportan 60 , but robust evidence for improved cellular delivery by these conjugates is still lacking. Although certain natural ligands such as transferrin, folate and RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp) peptides have been successfully used as targeting agents for siRNA when formulated into nanoparticles 61 -63 , these have yet to be thoroughly investigated as direct siRNA conjugates. Finally, siRNA conjugation to small molecules that bind to cell-surface receptors that are present on a limited number of cells should, in theory, enhance drug specificity and reduce the required drug concentration. Evidence for the in vivo use of small-molecule siRNA conjugates has so far not been published, and it is important to remember that these small molecules might not have the benefit of natural ligand conjugates, such as cholesterol, in facilitating siRNA incorporation into larger plasma protein complexes that evade rapid renal excretion and elimination. siRNAs can also be conjugated to RNA aptamers for delivery to specific cell types. This approach has the advantage that the therapeutic can be composed entirely of RNA. Recently, in vitro and in vivo proofof-concept has been shown using aptamers to prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a cell-surface receptor overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and tumour vascular endothelium 64, 65 . PSMA aptamers, either directly linked to siRNA 64 or conjugated through a modular strepta vidin bridge 65 , promote specific cellular uptake and RNAi-mediated silencing of target mRNA in vitro. siRNAs directed against survival genes (PLK1 and BCL2) and directly linked to PSMA aptamers were internalized by cells and resulted in RNAi-mediated target-mRNA silencing and cell death in vivo 64 . Short aptamers (25-35 bases long) that bind to a wide variety of targets with high affinity have been described 66 . It should be possible to design siRNA-aptamer chimeras with longer strands (45-55 bases) that are within the range of technical and commercial feasibility for synthesis, but longer molecules may prove difficult to synthesize on a commercial scale. However, although short aptamer conjugates work for local delivery in vivo, they can be rapidly cleared by the kidney and have a half-life that is too short for systemic therapy unless they are incorporated into larger particles.",

Liposomes, vesicles with an aqueous compartment enclosed in a phospholipid bilayer, can fuse with cell membranes and enhance drug delivery into cells. Polar drugs can be entrapped in their aqueous centre. When lipids complex with nucleic acids to form amorphous particles they are known as lipoplexes. Lipoplexes are formed by mixing siRNAs with most commercial transfection agents, such as Lipofectamine 2000 and Transit-TKO. Liposomes developed for therapeutic delivery of siRNAs are multi-component nanoparticles, typically composed of multiple lipids, including a cationic and/or a fusogenic lipid, cholesterol and a polyethylene glycosylated lipid. Each of these components has an important role in the fusogenicity and pharmacokinetic properties of the liposome (FIG. 3d; for review see .",

In vitro transfection of siRNA using lipid-based delivery agents is a routine laboratory procedure. However, some primary cell types, such as lymphocytes, are resistant to lipid-mediated transfection. Significant success has also been demonstrated with both local and systemic administration of siRNA using liposomes and lipoplexes. Intravenous injection of siRNA encapsulated in stable nucleic acidlipid particles (SNALPs 28 ) silenced ApoB dramatically in both mice and non-human primates 69 . Importantly, a single intravenous dose of 2.5 mg per kg of SNALP-formulated siRNA in cynomolgus monkeys reduced ApoB mRNA in the liver by more than 90%. Consequently, serum cholesterol and lowdensity lipoproteins were reduced by more than 65% and 85%, respectively. Moreover, following a single intravenous dose of 2.5 mg per kg of SNALP-formulated siRNA, gene silencing lasted for at least 11 days. Treatment with siRNA in liposomes was fairly well tolerated in these experiments, with transient increases in liver enzymes seen at the highest dose. The same SNALP formulations also effectively delivered siRNA to the liver in animal models of hepatitis B and Ebola virus infection 70, 71 . Whether these SNALPs can be used for delivering siRNA to organs other than the liver is uncertain. Systemic administration of other liposomal formulations and lipoplexes have resulted in the delivery of siRNA to other tissues. Intravenous delivery of a cationic lipoplex containing tumour necrosis factor (TNF) siRNA specifically inhibited TNF production in knee joints and alleviated disease in a mouse model of rheumatoid arthritis 72 , whereas caveolin-1 siRNA formulated in liposomes reduced target expression by 90% in mouse lung endothelia with the expected physiological effects 73 . In summary, use of lipid-based formulations for systemic delivery of siRNA, especially to the liver, represents one of the most promising nearterm opportunities for the development of RNAi therapeutics.",

Intracranial delivery of lipid-complexed siRNA targeting viral genes protected mice against fatal Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus encephalitis 57 . Similarly, intrathecal administration of cationic lipid formulated delta opioid receptor (DOR) siRNA facilitated delivery and specific target-gene silencing in the spinal cord and dorsal root, blocking antinociception by a DOR selective agonist 55 .

The usefulness of lipid-based delivery systems in many of these direct RNAi applications must be assessed in a target-cell-specific and disease-specific manner.

Ophthalmic indications have historically been attractive for oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. The only approved oligonucleotide-based drugs are used in the eye -Vitravene\u00ae to treat CMV retinitis 103 and Macugen\u00ae for AMD 104 . Direct injection into the vitreal cavity efficiently targets oligonucleotide drugs to the retina. Another advantage of the ocular compartment is that it is relatively free of nucleases compared with serum, permitting unmodified siRNA to be used in the vitreal cavity. However, exonuclease stabilizing chemistries can dramatically improve the persistence of intact siRNA following intravitreal injection (Alnylam, unpublished results).

The main barriers to successful RNAi delivery in vivo involve achieving proper pharmacokinetics to ensure drug exposure to the relevant target cell type and harnessing mechanisms to promote cellular uptake and the release of the drug into the cytoplasm. Progress has been made on this front through the use of covalent conjugation, non-covalent complexes and nanoparticles, but targeted delivery has yet to be optimized for most cell types and tissues. Solutions will probably need to be tailored for each target cell type and disease indication. In identifying and optimizing delivery solutions, the use of reporter systems (either endogenous cell-type specific genes or transgenes) could greatly expedite the process. Likewise, in optimizing formulations, it is vital that the key parameters of efficacy and safety are assessed in parallel to rapidly arrive at the formulations which have the greatest therapeutic window.",
