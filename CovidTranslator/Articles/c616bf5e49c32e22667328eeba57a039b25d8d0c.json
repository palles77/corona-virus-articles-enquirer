Proteins in plasma and BAL from two neutropenic rabbit models of IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia were analyzed by SELDI-TOF MS. Hierarchical clustering analysis of plasma time course spectra demonstrated two clusters of peaks that were differentially regulated between IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia (57 and 34 peaks, respectively, p<0.001). PCA of plasma proteins demonstrated a time-dependent separation of the two infections. A random forest analysis that ranked the top 30 spectral points distinguished between late Aspergillus and Pseudomonas pneumonias with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Based on spectral data analysis, three proteins were identified using SDS-PAGE and LC/MS and quantified using reverse phase arrays. Differences in the temporal sequence of plasma haptoglobin (p <0.001), apolipoprotein A1 (p<0.001) and transthyretin (p<0.038) were observed between IPA and Pseudomonas pneumonia, as was C-reactive protein (p<0.001). In summary, proteomic analysis of plasma and BAL proteins of experimental Aspergillus and Pseudomonas pneumonias demonstrates unique protein profiles with principal components and spectral regions that are shared in early infection and diverge at later stages of infection. Haptoglobin, apolipoprotein A1, transthyretin and C-reactive protein are differentially expressed in these infections suggesting important contributions to host defense against IPA.",

Proteomic analysis of blood protein profiles reveals distinct patterns and potential biomarkers for ovarian cancer, colonic adenocarcinoma, and uroepithelial tumors. However, little is known about the proteomic profiles of invasive mycoses. Understanding the in vivo proteomics of invasive mycoses has important diagnostic, therapeutic and pathophysiological implications.",

Our analytic approach was based on examining the spectra generated from neat plasma and concentrated BAL. SELDI-TOF mass spectroscopy methodology is based upon fractionation of proteins using different chip surface attractive properties [16] . SELDI-TOF profiles have been used to develop novel diagnostic protein signatures in cancer [17] [18] [19] [20] , graft-versus-host disease [21] , infectious diseases [22] [23] [24] [25] , and pulmonary inflammation [14] . Our data shows that SELDI-TOF expression profiles can provide a semiquantitative assessment of changes in protein expression over time following two distinct infections in an immunocompromised animal model. Using a principal component analysis of the entire transformed spectra, we were able to distinguish infected from non-infected animals and Aspergillus from Pseudomonas infection. These data analysis suggest that the spectrum contains information related to both the immune status (neutropenic versus nonneutropneic) and infectious etiology (Aspergillus versus Pseudomonas).",

These profiles may reflect increasing hostspecific responses to these pathogens or potentially pathogen-specific proteins. Our approach used strong anion exchange surface fractionation that biased the spectrum towards more abundant host proteins. The detection of galactomannan, a fungal wall constituent in plasma as early as day two-post innoculation of Aspergillus conidia (Figure 1 Supplement) as well as in the BAL, demonstrates that pathogen-related biomarkers are present in these fluids. However, the methods used in the current study did not succeed in identifying novel pathogen-associated proteins that have been described in vitro [26] .

            "text": "The virulence of A. fumigatus is related in part to the production of toxins such as Asphemolysin that produces hemolysis of erythrocytes and is cytotoxic to macrophages and endothelial cells [34] . The dramatic acute rise in HPT with IPA may relate in part to this hemolytic activity (Figure 8 ). While HPT has both anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties [35] [36] [37] , it also accelerates the clearance of free hemoglobin and thus prevents the use of hemoglobin-associated iron for microbial growth [35] . The HPT-hemoglobin complex undergoes macrophage endocytosis via CD 163 and the iron molecule catalytically released by heme oxygenase. Intracellular iron is either sequestered with ferritin or mobilized to an export protein (ferroprotein or MTP-1) [36] . Iron is a necessary nutrient for Aspergillus virulence factor production [34] and iron chelation strategies in vitro suggest a new means of treatment Aspergillus infections [38] . Thus, the acute rise in HPT during IPA may reflect both the scavenging of free hemoglobin and the sequestration of iron, an essential vital growth factor for A. fumigatus. Rabbits exposed to aerosols of Aspergillus terreus spores have acute increases in HPT levels and when given passive transfer of HPT rich plasma, hypoxemic responses were blunted suggesting a modulation of host pulmonary inflammatory response [39] . Further, HPT has immunomodulatory effects in part due to binding to CD11b and by inhibition of TH2 type cytokine responses. It shifts the balance of T cell cytokine responses in favor of TH1 immune responses suggesting a potential important role in the host response to fungal infections [37] .",

The factors contributing to this rate of rise may be due in part to the acute organism burden from the inoculation of the fungal hyphae and magnitude of the host cytokine response inducing a greater hepatic acute phase response. The antimicrobial effects of CRP result from its activation of complement and its role as a bacterial opsonin. CRP promotes the phagocytosis of metabolically active conidia of A. fumigatus independent of complement activation [40] . Macrophages exposed to CRP increase production of reactive oxygen species, tissue factor, proinflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules [41] . Endothelial cells exposed to CRP increase the release of chemokines (IL-8, MCP-1), upregulate adhesion molecule expression, and enhance monocyte adhesion [41, 42] . While elevated CRP levels were associated with specific IL-1 gene polymorphisms in patients with hematologic malignancies and IPA, CRP values were similar between patients with and without IPA [43] .",

The plasma galactomannan in this neutropenic model for IPA was significantly increased within the first three days, which is consistent with previous observations of the expression of galactomannan in IPA in neutropenic rabbit model systems and neutropenic patients with IPA [44] . Various PCR techniques for detecting Aspergillus species are being used on blood and BAL fluid [45, 46] however none of the PCR-based tests are yet standardized or validated for reference laboratory use. The SELDI platform is a semiquantitative tool for discovery and for hypothesis generation. It spectral patterns are rich with information that will vary with the method of fractionation used to simplify complex biologic fluids. However, as currently performed it is difficult to standardize sufficiently for routine clinical use. Future developments using new fractionation methods and capture techniques may offer promise to improve the sensitivity, quantitation and standardization of this platform [47] .",

In order to establish an experimental foundation for understanding the proteomic host-pathogen response in IPA, we analyzed differential protein expression with SELDI-TOF in plasma and BAL fluid from a well-characterized rabbit model of this medically important infection. Our results show that specific patterns of host protein expression distinguish Aspergillus pneumonia from Pseudomonas pneumonia in plasma as well as BAL fluid. Time-dependent patterns of protein expression were found in plasma that were associated with the development of IPA. The differential expression of the acute phase reactants APOA1, HPT, CRP and TTHY contribute to the differences between these two infectious etiologies. These data support the concept that patterns of proteins are expressed with different microbial infections and may provide a new approach to understanding host-pathogen interaction, detection, and prognostic stratification.",
