The roughly quadratic growth can be explained by considering the population as a two-dimensional planar network where the infected population only grows in the periphery of isolated 'patches' of infection [2] . The observed final inflection is not to be confused with the saturation of a logistic growth curve, which arises due to negative feedback as the number of susceptible people decreases with spreading of the infection. This effect is unlikely to contribute in the Chinese case, since even pessimistic estimates of the total number of COVID-19 cases stay very small compared to the total population. More likely, this effect can be attributed to extreme containment measures enacted in China. These measures disconnect the social network structure, producing caging effects that sufficiently slow down the spreading below a reproduction number of 1.",

Initially, in phase I, strong quarantine measures were imposed on detected and suspected individuals who traveled from at-risk regions. In case of confirmed infections, their recent history of contacts was traced back and these individuals were quarantined as well as tested for COVID-19. Phase II included fast testing and quarantine of all individuals that exhibit symptoms. In phase III, drastic societal containment strategies are enacted. Regardless of symptoms, individuals are to minimize any social interactions. Due to restricted testing capacity, tests are only performed on individuals that exhibit severe symptoms. An important consequence of this strategy is that the number of confirmed cases can be heavily biased by shifting testing capacity and testing priorities. As an alternative, we propose that the accumulated number of hospitalized individuals is a good indicator for the number of actual COVID-19, albeit with a shift in time. This temporal shift is roughly equal to the combination of the mean incubation time (\u2248 5 days) and the average time from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization (\u2248 2 days) [6] .",

For the latter, we estimate a fractal exponent \u00b5 = 2.22. The number of deaths D follows a power law growth D \u221d t \u00b5 d with \u00b5 d = 3.27. As of March 29th, no significant deviations of neither H a nor D from the power law growth can be observed. Furthermore, Fig. 1 shows the predicted accumulated hospitalization X and infectious population I from a fit using the SIR-X model. The parameters that fit the observed growth of H a are listed in Table 1 . The estimated value of \u03ba 0 , the containment rate of the whole population is very close to zero. Consequently, the public containment leverage P is low as well. The quarantine probability is estimated at a value of Q = 0.780. Furthermore, there is a strong reduction of the reproduction number, with an effective reproduction number of R 0,eff = 1.36, much smaller than the unrestrained reproduction number R 0,free = 6.2. Finally, the SIR-X model predicts that the maximal number of infectious individuals occurs around April 12. Fig. 2(a) shows the number of accumulated hospitalizations as well as deaths due to COVID-19 in comparison to the fitted SIR-x model. Setting an average mortality of 15% for all hospitalized cases [9], we find that the SIR-X model coincides with the number of deaths when including a temporal delay of only \u2248 5 days. Assuming an average hospitalization time of 12 days, and that between 15% and 20% of currently hospitalized patients require intensive care treatment (ICU), we predict based on the SIR-X model the temporal evolution of the current number of patients in ICU - Fig. 2(b-c) . These assumptions align with the observed current number of ICU patients. For the estimated SIR-X model parameters, the number of ICU patients will peak around April 20th. The peak count of ICU patients greatly varies with the average ICU retention time, but will peak at significantly higher values than the current ICU capacity in Belgian hospitals of 2650 beds, Fig. 2(d) . This approximately quadratic growth indicates a small-world network structure with mostly local interactions through which the spreading of the infection occurs. This is consistent with the observation based on data from Belgian telecom operators, which show that more than 80% of Belgians have stayed within their own commune (postal code) for the last two weeks, and that individual displacements of over 40 km have been reduced by 90%. At the time of this writing, no significant deviation from this power law scaling has been observed for the accumulated Belgian hospitalization data. This indicates that the current social network is still sufficiently well connected to continue local spreading of the disease. In part, these local network links could be attributed to the infection of direct family members. Without extensive testing, many infected people will be locked into their homes and pose a contamination risk for their families. In a severe lock-down, this effect should be controlled within a few days. Hence, other factors may contribute to the continuation of the power law scaling. Another spreading mechanisms could be local supermarkets, where in spite of extensive safety measures, significant spreading of the highly infectious corona virus could occur. A solution can be to enforce a more rigid approach, in which supermarkets are viewed as local distribution centres. Most supermarkets already provide online shopping services, where people fill in their online shopping carts. This would allow for an optimal spreading of customers, and/or would make it possible to deliver groceries in a drive-through system. The result would be a large reduction of the small-world connectivity, resulting in a lowering of the exponents, thereby further flattening the curve.",

On the other hand, the removal , compared to predictions from the SIR-X model, assuming that 15% or 20% of hospitalized patients require intensive care. (d) Longer-time extrapolation assuming 17.5% ICU shows a peak of ICU patients around April 20th. Different curves show varying ICU retention times. The shorter the ICU retention time, the lower and earlier the ICU peak will be. rate of symptomatic individuals is much higher, leading to a strongly decreased effective reproduction number, and a moderately high quarantine probability. These SIR-X model parameters are somewhat similar to values estimated for the Beijing region of China [4] . When extrapolating the number of deaths using the SIR-X model, the predicted death toll due to COVID-19 will exceed 10 3 by April 3rd. The SIR-X model for accumulated hospitalizations is compatible with the current number of patients in intensive care when assuming that between 15% and 20% of hospitalized patients need ICU treatment, and that the average retention time in ICU is around 12 days. Extrapolation with these parameters predicts a peak in number of ICU patients around April 15th, with the number of ICU patients exceeding the capacity of the Belgian healthcare system of 2650 beds.",
