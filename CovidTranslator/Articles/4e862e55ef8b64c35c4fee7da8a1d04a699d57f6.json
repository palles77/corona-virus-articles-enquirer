Here, we present a conceptual framework for classifying patterns of incidence and prevalence, and review recent scientific advances that allow us to study and manage reservoirs simultaneously. We argue that interventions can have a crucial role in enriching our mechanistic understanding of how reservoirs function and should be embedded as quasiexperimental studies in adaptive management frameworks. Single approaches to the study of reservoirs are unlikely to generate conclusive insights whereas the formal integration of data and methodologies, involving interventions, pathogen genetics, and contemporary surveillance techniques, promises to open up new opportunities to advance understanding of complex multihost systems.",

Although a range of developments has led to better theoretical conceptualisation of reservoirs [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , their empirical characterisation remains a challenge. In this article, we review methods currently used to characterise each of the components that comprise a reservoir according to the framework in Box 1. Specifically, we first present a conceptual approach for classifying patterns of incidence and prevalence (see Glossary) that result from the connectivity between source and target populations (black arrows in Figure I in Box 1). We then review methods that allow us to identify maintenance or nonmaintenance populations (squares or circles in Figure  I , Box 1), how they are connected (arrows in Figure I , Box 1), and the role that each of these populations has in maintaining the pathogen (i.e., reservoir capacity).",

Here, we further discuss how to enrich this evidence base. Almost inevitably, the need to intervene will precede adequate understanding of the dynamics of reservoir-target systems. Our central thesis is that interventions that are meticulously planned to optimise both the immediate short-term benefits to the target population and the longer-term understanding of how reservoirs function, applied together with a formal integration of data and methods [13] , can provide powerful new opportunities for studying complex multihost systems (e.g., [14] ).",

Arrow thickness denotes rate of transmission. In (A), the reservoir comprises a single source maintenance population that transmits to a nonmaintenance target population. In (B), the reservoir comprises two connected nonmaintenance populations (of which one is the source) that together form a maintenance community. In (C), the target is a maintenance population and a source of infection and, thus, is part of the reservoir. In (D), the reservoir comprises three nonmaintenance populations, together forming two minimal maintenance communities each capable of maintaining the pathogen; together, these form a larger maintenance community. In (E), the reservoir comprises a maintenance community of multiple connected nonmaintenance populations, four of which are source populations. Modified from [5] .",

As R 0,T !1, these outbreaks can become large. However, as the interval between introductions becomes shorter than the average duration of outbreaks, we observe a pseudo-endemic pattern in which the target population can appear to be a maintenance population even when it is not ( Figure 1 , zone D). Systems in which R 0,T is close to 1 present particular threats because small changes in their epidemiology within the target population, through either pathogen evolution or changes in the target population structure, can cause R 0,T to exceed 1 and lead to an endemic situation and/or epidemic behaviour [17] .",

However, their interpretation remains fraught with uncertainties mainly owing to cross-reactivity, declining antibody titres, cut-off thresholds used to distinguish positive and negative reactions, and difficulties with the detectability of antibodies because these depend on the relation between immunity and infection resistance (e.g., a detectable antibody does not always imply protection and the time of exposure remains unknown for pathogens that create life-long immunity in the host) [24] . New statistical approaches, such as latent class methods and site-occupancy modelling, have been suggested recently to improve estimates of prevalence from imperfect tests by allowing uncertainty in the detection of infection state [25] . Although still in early stages of development, advanced modelling techniques, such as Bayesian process models, can enable inferences of timing of exposure from ageseroprevalence data, accounting for non-stationary epidemiological dynamics [26] , and/or detect cross-species transmission [27] , to identify which host species is the most likely source of infection.",

            "text": "The first challenge is to define the population in which persistence is to be measured. Given that persistence is sensitive to the complex relation between demographic and epidemiological factors, it is difficult to estimate in the presence of population structure [30, 31] ; therefore, CCS is most commonly discussed in the context of single well-mixed populations, although these are rare in natural systems. The second challenge is in defining persistence, particularly because any estimate of CCS is likely to be sensitive to the choice of persistence metric [32] . In his original work, Bartlett defined CCS as the size of a population in which extinction was as likely as not following a major outbreak [29] . However, persistence might also be measured from an initial condition corresponding to the endemic equilibrium [33, 34] . Lloyd-Smith et al. [35] point out that the relation between persistence and population size is not well described as a step function, but instead increases in a gradual manner. CCS can also be thought of in relation to the probability of extinction within a given time or the time until a given proportion (usually 50%) of introductions (or simulations) have gone extinct [36] . Once appropriate definitions are adopted, the final challenge is estimating CCS. The main approaches used are: (i) empirical observation, which consist of plotting incidence data against population size [28, [37] [38] [39] ; (ii) analytic expressions [34, [40] [41] [42] , although all approximations so far exclude many processes relevant to CCS, such as latency, spatial heterogeneity, seasonality, age structure, and nonexponential infectious periods [40, 43] ; and (iii) stochastic computer simulations, in which parameterised compartmental models are used to generate distributions of persistence times for populations of different sizes and from which CCS can be estimated [33, 34] . However, these studies assume a linear relationship between population size and recruitment, which is unrealistic in natural systems [35] . Beyond studies of measles [44] [45] [46] , little work has been done to estimate CCS.",

This method estimates a threshold that is similar to R 0 (or the effective reproduction number in the endemic case) separately for individual host populations within a multigroup population rather than averaging across all populations [47] . For example, using NGM, mallards and other dabbling ducks were reported to be part of the most likely reservoir community of influenza A in the global water bird population [8] . However, this method focuses strictly on whether persistence is possible (i.e., whether the appropriate reproductive number exceeds 1), and ignores the stochasticity and nonequilibrium dynamics that are central to classical thinking on CCS. Also, implementations of the method have relied on the strong assumption that infection prevalence is at endemic equilibrium in all host species.",

            "text": "Statistical modelling is increasingly used to identify plausible sources of infection. One of the advantages of modelling is that they can be used for partially observed processes [e.g., approximate Bayesian computation [48, 49] , state-space models (SSM; [50] ), and Markov models [50] [51] [52] ]. For example, SSMs make an explicit distinction between data that can be observed (e.g., infected individuals detected by surveillance) and the underlying process itself, which might be largely unobserved (e.g., all infection events). Beyer et al. [50] constructed an SSM of rabies persistence in the Serengeti District in Tanzania that used records of humans reporting to hospital with dog bite injuries. Using a statespace implementation of a metapopulation process describing the unobserved process of dog-to-dog transmission between villages, they were able to estimate parameters capturing the effects of intervillage distance and the size of dog populations on rabies dynamics. Based on these, they inferred that it was more likely that dog rabies infections were being imported from unvaccinated domestic dogs in outlying districts, or from wild peri-urban carnivores in the Serengeti district itself, rather than from wildlife residing within the National Park. Despite their advantages, inferences rely on valid assumptions being made about the biological processes embodied in model structure. Given a possible set of transmission parameters, plausible reservoirs of infection can also be identified using simulation models [43, 53, 54] . Transmission parameters are typically obtained from epidemiological, demographic, or genetic data, and can be manipulated to explore the sensitivity of the reservoir dynamics to these parameters. For example, Cross et al. [54] used an age-structured model of two interacting elk populations (free-ranging and those receiving supplemental feeding) to investigate the extent to which dispersal from feeding grounds could explain changes in brucellosis seroprevalence in elk around the Yellowstone ecosystem. They found that R 0 in the freeranging elk population (the target population) had increased to above 1 over the past 20 years, probably due to changes in elk aggregations that led to enhanced elk-toelk transmission (i.e., moved from zone C to E in Figure 1 ).",

Genealogybased methods have particular appeal because, for many pathogens, the accumulation of mutations takes place on approximately the same timescale as transmission. If transmission chains are genetically distinguishable, they can provide complementary information to incidence and prevalence data. For example, given sufficient pathogen genetic variability in the reservoir, genetic data should readily distinguish rare spillover and subsequent transmission in the target from scenarios involving the same incidence due only to a high Box 2. Using pathogen genetics to untangle reservoirtarget dynamics Methods based on discrete ancestral state inference offer an appealing statistical way to approach the problem of multihost transmission by fitting probabilistic models to pathogen sequence data [79] . In these methods, genealogies are constructed from the data, and host associations (states) observed at the tips of the trees are used to estimate the conditional probability of being affiliated with a particular host population along all interior branches. Transmission events between host populations and, thus, the net contribution of the reservoir to dynamics in the target, can be enumerated through Markov jump counts [56, 80] . A more formal population genetic framework, centred on joint estimation of population sizes and migration rates across all patches [81, 82] , can similarly be adapted to deal with pathogen gene flow [83] .",

There is strong reason to suspect that biased sampling can have a profound influence on the inferences generated. For example, genetically unsampled sources of infection will not only remain undetectable, but their contribution will also be wrongly attributed to populations included in the sample (a problem akin to that caused by 'ghost populations' in population genetics [85] ). Moreover, inferred transmission dynamics can depend on the relative spatial and temporal density of sampling among host populations. Finally, stuttering chains within the target population can boost the frequency of cases (compare zones A and C in Figure 1 , main text) and, hence, the likelihood of detection under sparse sampling; if unaccounted for, this can lead to overestimation of cross-species transmission rates. These complexities can generate significant challenges for the investigation of reservoir-target systems because balanced, representative sampling, proportional to the incidence in each host, is rarely achievable. Therefore, developing robust ways to deal with problems related to sampling in the context of genealogical inference and the reconstruction of transmission histories remains an important focal area for future research.",

Representing the reservoir as a metapopulation, we can extend the notion of metapopulation capacity [59] to that of reservoir capacity (Box 3). Reservoir capaci-ty, l' M , is a measure of the potential of a structured host population to support pathogen persistence in the absence of external imports and, thus, can be used to assess whether a population constitutes a reservoir. A useful benefit is that associated patch values V i (i.e., the relative contribution of each population to overall persistence; Box 3) can be used to prioritise populations when designing interventions. The modelling framework encapsulates three processes (within-population processes, transmission between populations, and community-level persistence) and is normally used to investigate one of these processes when it is possible to parameterise the other two.",

            "text": "Interventions that generate substantial (and, thus, more easily measurable) changes to the system are the most likely to provide useful information. Such interventions can be akin to 'press' (sustained action; e.g., long-term vaccination) or 'pulse' (one-off action; e.g., single culling or vaccination campaign) phenomena that are familiar to ecologists [63] , or 'block' perturbations (where potential transmission between reservoir and target is impeded; e.g., fences). Power can be assessed from predictions based on classical sensitivity or elasticity analysis [64] . Interventions that induce no changes can also be informative if, for example, they allow us to rule out a particular transmission route or source population. What can be learned from such interventions is dependent on whether they enable relevant hypotheses to be tested. It is also important to note that these interventions can alter the target-reservoir transmission dynamics, leading to difficulties in distinguishing causes and effects of the intervention. For example, the Randomised Badger Culling Trial conducted over 3000 km 2 and a 10-year time period [65] generated a wealth of data and analysis that should be instrumental in determining the circumstances in which badger culling might usefully contribute to the effective control of bovine TB in the UK. However, it might not be simple to determine whether particular changes in the reservoir-target disease transmission dynamics were a direct or indirect (due to dispersal and behaviour change) consequence of the culling. The main challenge in using adaptive management lies in balancing knowledge gain that enables improved future control with achieving the best short-term outcome based on current knowledge [66] . It might be that an intervention that optimises the short-term outcome (e.g., one resulting in the greatest reduction of disease prevalence in the target) is also the one that provides the greatest statistical power to test the hypothesis of interest. In other situations, there can be a trade-off between the short-term goals of rapid disease control and the longer-term goals of learning about the system to optimise future control. This is particularly true given the cost of allocating resources to monitoring, the need to include experimental control areas [67] , and the challenge of defining efficient experimental designs (e.g., stepped wedged trial; [68] ) for the hypothesis being tested [62, 69] . For example, faced with limited knowledge about the dynamics of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in Wisconsin (US), the US Department of Natural Resources established an adaptive management programme to eradicate CWD from the area [70] . The intervention was based on random deer culling, but a key component of the program was the collection of lymph nodes and brain tissue from the culled and harvested deer to assess the spatial distribution of CWD and provide further insights into its epidemiology.",

[14] found support for the hypothesis that domestic dogs, rather than wildlife, constitute the maintenance population for canine rabies in northern Tanzania. Their analyses included post-hoc integration of long-term case monitoring data (suggesting that rabies can persist in high-density domestic dog populations), genetic data (showing that a single rabies virus variant circulates among a range of species), and analysis of incidence patterns (indicating that spillover from domestic dog populations initiated only short-lived chains of transmission in other carnivores, consistent with zone C in Figure 1 ).",

Such integrative approaches are rare, but increasingly powerful methods are being developed. For example, genetic, spatial, and epidemiological data can now be combined to enable detailed reconstruction of transmission within and between host populations (e.g., [73, 74] ) and time-calibrated phylogenies can be layered with geographical and epidemiological data in a joint framework that enables estimation of the frequency and directionality of interspecies transmission (e.g., [56, 75] ). For example, based on viral gene sequences and epidemiological data, Faria et al. [75] reconstructed the cross-species transmission history of rabies virus between North American bats and identified ecological and evolutionary constraints on transmission patterns. Latent variable models that explicitly parameterise both process and observation models are also well suited to combining data types, particularly when observations are sparse [26] . Developing statistically rigorous analytical methods that integrate multiple data layers is a challenging but exciting area, and key to future progress in infectious disease ecology [76, 77] .

However, to realise these benefits fully, we must form broad-based interdisciplinary teams, engage with their full range of expertise from the earliest planning stages, and support them throughout the lifetime of the intervention.
