            "text": "We investigated the capacity of internal border control to limit infl uenza spread in an emergent pandemic in the context of Australia, a country with a low-population density and geopolitical boundaries that may facilitate restrictions. Mathematical models were used to study the time delay between epidemics in 2 population centers when travel restrictions were imposed. The models demonstrated that population size, travel rates, and places where travelers reside can strongly infl uence delay. The model simulations suggested that moderate delays in geographic spread may be possible with stringent restrictions and a low reproduction number, but results will be sensitive to the reproduction number and timing of restrictions. Model limitations include the absence of further importations and additional control measures. Internal border control may have a role in protecting domestic centers early in a pandemic, when importations are sparse. Our results may be useful for policymakers. C ommercial air travel has increased dramatically since the last pandemic of infl uenza (1) . The number of international tourist arrivals recorded worldwide in 2004 was 763.2 million; 43% of these arrivals were by air (2) . This increase in international travel has heightened the risk for the global spread of infectious diseases (1) .",

However, if these strategies fail, individual governments will need to implement strategies to manage the pandemic when it arrives on their borders. In addition to well-publicized options for control, including antiviral prophylaxis and quarantine (6, 7) , travel restrictions, both external and internal, may play a role in reducing the geographic spread of the virus (8) (9) (10) (11) Restrictions on travel can have a sizeable economic and social impact, as seen in affected nations during the crisis with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In many countries, stringent travel restrictions will not be feasible because of high population densities and highly connected networks of transportation, infrastructure, and trade. These caveats do not apply to Australia, an island comparable in size to the United States but with a population of only 20 million. This population is concentrated in 5 large cities, along with smaller centers, primarily along its eastern and southern coastlines. These centers are widely separated; travel between them is primarily by air. During the 1918 pandemic, Australia delayed the onset of the pandemic by 1 year by imposing external border control (12) .",

Typically, modeling studies of infl uenza spread are focused on predicting international or national spread between major hubs on the global air-transportation network (8, 9, 13) , which is certainly important. In contrast, we examine the effects of travel restrictions on 2-city routes with differing characteristics. This simpler setting allows a more detailed exploration of how the delay between epidemics in 2 connected locations depends on travel restrictions, population sizes, travel rates, residence of travelers, and the transmissibility of the infl uenza virus, with relevance to large and small centers. The analysis assumes case-patients arriving from overseas have a negligible effect, so the results apply primarily during the early stage of a pandemic. Simulating the effect of internal travel restrictions in Australia is relevant to countries with similar demographic characteristics, such as Russia, Canada, and New Zealand. The aims of our analysis were to explore the role of travel restrictions in slowing the geographic spread of an infl uenza pandemic and to simulate the effects of such restrictions in the context of Australia.",

In the fi rst, it was assumed that the initial cases occurred in Sydney. The growth of this epidemic and its resultant spread to Melbourne in the presence of travel restrictions were simulated. This scenario is indicative of the spread to other large centers with similar travel volumes. In the second scenario, the initial case was assumed to occur in Darwin, a smaller Australian city in close proximity to Southeast Asia, and the growth of this epidemic and spread to Sydney were simulated. The Darwin-to-Sydney scenario, with a comparatively low travel volume, represents the situation of containing the epidemic within a smaller town through the use of travel restrictions. Key parameters and assumptions are summarized in Table 1 .",

This feature of the model is supported by virus-shedding studies (22) and enables us to contrast the effect of a highly peaked infectivity profi le, similar to that used by Ferguson et al.

The infectivity profi le primarily infl uences the growth rate through the mean time (or serial interval) between cases: \u22482.8 days for the peaked infectivity function and 4 days for the fl at infectivity function used here. The doubling time depends linearly on the serial interval so that epidemics that use the peaked infectivity profi le double in size almost 1.5\u00d7 as quickly as epidemics that use the fl at infectivity profi le, for the same value of R 0 .

If, for example, an additional day of latent infection were added, then the delays in spread, when the fl at and peaked infectivity functions were used, were \u224825% and \u224837% longer, respectively, which is a considerable effect. However, epidemic growth rates in past pandemics are typically not consistent with longer latent periods and low values of R 0 , so these additional delays should be viewed with caution.",

The growth rate can be estimated from case counts during an epidemic and used in a simple formula to predict the delay due to travel restrictions (online Appendix, part D). These predictions could provide practical estimates of the benefi ts of longer term travel restrictions based on the fi rst clusters of cases during an outbreak. For smaller communities with low travel rates, the probability of preventing an outbreak can also be estimated (online Appendix, part D), with good agree-ment with the results of our simulations (online Appendix Figure, panel C). If the estimated growth rate is high (e.g., assumptions used in Figures 2 and 4 with R 0 = 3.5, peaked infectivity), the additional median delay between 20 cases occurring in city 1 and 20 cases occurring in city 2 might be just 3 days, providing little benefi t from longer term implementation of travel restrictions Our results do not account for additional importations. Thus, they are most applicable to the arrival of a pandemic in Australia, while the pandemic outside Australia remains contained or border control is effective. Our simulated delays will be overestimates if additional importations are substantial. Another concern is that stringent travel restrictions may be required for several weeks to maximize delays in spread. Inevitably, such restrictions would cause economic and social disruption, which must be balanced against any benefi ts from delaying the domestic spread of an epidemic.",

However, the economic impact of restrictions in major centers could be enormous, with severe consequences for service and travel industries, as seen in the SARS crisis (25) , and the potential to affect trade and other sections of the economy. Some of the benefi ts and costs of reduced travel may also accrue without restrictions, with persons avoiding travel because of perceived risks. Our modeling suggests that travel restrictions could have a greater effect in more isolated communities that lack international ports. The travel restrictions we discussed have been examined in isolation, without consideration of other disease control measures. Other measures could lower the effective value of the reproduction number, or even curtail the epidemic; in these circumstances, reducing all travel by only 80% might be benefi cial. Alternatively, if the R 0 , is much higher than used here (23) , internal travel restrictions would be ineffective. Limitations of our modeling approach are summarized in Table 3 .",
