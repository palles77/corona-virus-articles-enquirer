Thus, the terms \"encephalomyelitis,\" \"meningoencephalitis,\" and \"meningoencephalomyelitis\" may apply.

The nervous system is very effectively isolated from other organ systems by the blood-brain, blood-CSF, CSF-extracellular fluid, blood-eye, and blood-nerve barriers.

Encephalitic animals often present with already altered states of consciousness and are therefore much more susceptible to anesthetic accidents. Great care must be taken in administering and monitoring anesthesia in animals with encephalitis. Encephalitis causes cerebral edema, which leads to increased intracranial pressure. When CSF is removed, the ventricular volume and, thus, intracranial pressure is reduced, allowing the parenchyma to swell further. If the intracranial pressure is sufficiently increased when CSF is removed, the cerebral hemispheres and cerebellum will move caudally under the tentorium cerebelli and through the foramen magnum, respectively, causing midbrain and medullary brain-stem compression.

If increased intracranial pressure is suspected, CSF collection should be delayed while attempts are made to therapeutically reduce the pressure. Drugs that have proved helpful in reducing cerebral edema are osmotic diuretics, ghlcocorticoids (generally contraindicated in CNS inflammatory disease), dimethylsulfoxide, barbiturates, nonsteroidal analgesics, antifibrinolytic agents, antibiogenic amine compounds, endorphin antagonists, and blood flow stimulants. 73 These same drugs are advocated when tentorial herniation is suspected. Improvement in clinical signs indicates response to therapy, at which time a decision on CSF collection can be made. Fortunately, in most cases of inflammatory CNS disease, intracranial pressure is not elevated significantly enough to prevent collection and analysis ofCSF. 72 Collection of CSF may hasten the spread of an inflammatory process by altering CSF flow dynamics. During CSF collection, fluid is withdrawn at a rate faster than the normal flow rate of CSF through the ventricles, subarachnoid space, and central spinal canal. If the causative agent is present in the CSF, its movement through the CNS, may be hastened. Also, the meninges may become contaminated secondary to the spinal tap.",

Elimination of the organisms from the body depends on the immunocompetence of the animal. The use of chloramphenicol is not advised in anemic animals but can be preferable in young dogs to avoid tetracycline staining of the teeth, Supportive therapy will vary among individual cases but may include fresh blood or platelet-rich plasma transfusions, bone marrow stimulants, fluid therapy, and appetite stimulants. Doxycycline has proved more effective than oxytetracycline in the treatment of ehrlichiosis. Being a lipid-soluble tetracycline, doxycycline has better penetration into the CNS and should be preferred in cases with CNS involvement.",
