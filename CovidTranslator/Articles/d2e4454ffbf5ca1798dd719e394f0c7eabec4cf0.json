At a first glance, t he application of the proposed principles and protocol ( Fig. 1 to 3) , could appear as unfeasible; because it could require overpassing some social, logistic and economical barriers; as never seen before. Nevertheless, we must also consider that this is a particular situation, which is challenging the health and economy as rarely seen in history. If the virus has been able to adapt across species, the human society should be able adapting quickly too, by working across countries, sectors and communities. The protocol is not a strict guideline with which everybody must comply. Rather, is a proposal for potential solutions and it is only a \"starting\" point open to improvements and adaptations across different capacities and realities. In Table 1 , are resumed some considerations on: strengths, limitations, and possible solutions for the protocol applications. Permission to sample at random in the human needs to be considered quickly. However, it is very likely that the vast majority of randomly selected people will agree to participate, because of the urgency and a good understanding among the public. Some considerations on survey\u00b4s setting and comparing their outputs for human populations can be found in [13] [14] \uf0b7 Applying the protocol on a National scale in a population of several million people could be unfeasible if the costs are perceived as too high and participation/capacity is low. Nevertheless if the protocol can be used only in part of the affected countries, then the estimated TP could be generalized to other areas/cities/regions that seem to be in a similar: environmental, demographic, logistical and epidemiological situation.",
