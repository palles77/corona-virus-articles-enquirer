While direct person-to-person transmission via respiratory droplets accounted for most cases, other modes have not been ruled out. SARS-CoV viraemia does not seem to reach high titres, however, it has to be excluded that virus transmission may occur via blood transfusion or application of therapeutic plasma products, e.g. freshfrozen plasma or single components derived thereof. Manufacturing processes of all plasma derivatives are required to comprise dedicated virus inactivation/removal steps. Treatment with a mixture of solvent and detergent (SD) has successfully been applied to inactivate the most members of the transfusion-relevant viruses without affecting therapeutic properties of the products. The SD treatment irreversibly disrupts the lipid envelope of viruses such as HIV, HBV, HCV, HGV and CMV. In this study we evaluated the manufacturing process of an immunoglobulin preparation (OCTAGAM, manufactured by Octapharma Pharmazeutika Produktionsges.m.b.H., Vienna, Austria) for its capacity to inactivate the SARS-CoV. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV was completely inactivated below the limit of detection. This was found to occur within 1 min of SD treatment.",

            "text": "Although human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV is less efficient than for other air-borne viruses such as influenza A viruses, the recent SARS epidemic was characterised by several explosive outbreaks [4, 24] . Most infections resulted from direct transmission via respiratory droplets during close personal contact and adequate protective measures were shown to be effective [22, 25] . However, there are a number of instances when transmission occurred through other modes not yet well defined. In central China, around 50% of probable SARS patients did not have an apparent history of close personal contact with another victim [14] . At least a portion of these cases may have arisen from modes of transmission different from respiratory droplets. Besides virus shedding into stool samples, SARS-CoV viraemia occurs, but does not seem to reach high titres (z200 copies/ml) [16, 21] . During the SARS-CoV-epidemic, concerns were raised about the possibility of SARS-CoV transmission by transfusion of blood components or therapeutic plasma products. Manufacturing processes of all plasma derivatives are required to comprise dedicated virus inactivation/removal steps for enveloped viruses [5] . Treatment with a mixture of solvent and detergent (SD) is used by many manufacturers worldwide and has successfully been applied to clotting factor and immunoglobulin preparations [2, 11, 17] . The SD treatment causes enveloped viruses to be irreversibly destroyed. These include the human immunodeficiency virus types 1 C 2 (HIV-1, HIV-2), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis G virus (HGV) and human cytomegalovirus (CMV) [17] .",

To confirm this assumption, verification studies with SARS-CoV were performed for the SD treatment conditions used in the manufacturing of an immunoglobulin concentrate intended for intravenous application (OCTAGAM, manufactured by Octapharma Pharmazeutika Produktionsges. m.b.H., Vienna, Austria). In full-scale manufacturing, SD process conditions include treatment with 0.3% (w/w) tri(nbutyl)phosphate (TNBP) and 1.0% (w/w) Octoxynol (trade name: Triton X-100) at 6.0 G 0.5 C and at pH 5.3 G 0.2 for a minimum of 4 h. In compliance with the CPMP [5, 6] , the robustness of each virus inactivation method has to be demonstrated experimentally. Therefore, the inactivation of SARS-CoV by SD treatment was investigated in the laboratory scale at lowered concentration of solvent and detergent (75% of standard SD concentration) and at a shortened process time (30 min).",

This process involves the sequential purification of protein fractions by adding various concentrations of ethanol with concurrent adjustments in pH, ionic strength and temperature. The precipitation and separation of fraction I C III from fraction II is considered the most viral safety relevant step for the non-lipid enveloped viruses. Starting materials in this study were process intermediates (resuspended fraction II) obtained from the manufacturing scale, which were spiked 1 in 20 with virus. An aliquot of the starting material without SD was individually spiked also 1 in 20 with virus and titrated to confirm the amount of virus added. This spiked intermediate (without SD) was titrated at the beginning of the process (virus-spiked intermediate control 0 min) and at the end of the process (virus-spiked intermediate control 30 min). This separate spiking was required, because, in the presence of SD reagents, the initial titre of any virus-spiked process intermediate would not represent the quantity of virus actually inoculated. Infectivity was determined by endpoint titration on Vero cells. The SD treatment was terminated in the laboratory studies by diluting 1:250 with cell culture medium. In order to prove that the inactivation by SD was terminated by our dilution procedure, an aliquot (100 ml) of the SD containing intermediate was prediluted 1:237.5 with cell culture medium. This solution was then spiked with virus (1 in 20), resulting in a final dilution factor of 1:250 with respect to SD (termination control). Specific non-spiked process intermediates were obtained for control procedures and tested for their potential cytotoxicity (see below) for the Vero cells and for their potential interference with the detection of low virus titres. All controls were serially 10-fold diluted and eight cultures (inoculum size 0.05 ml) of each dilution were established.",

The cell cultures were maintained in a CO 2 incubator at 37 C. Vero cultures were examined microscopically and evaluated for virus-induced (or cytotoxic) cell changes. The virus titres were calculated according to the method of Spearman and Ka\u00a8rber [12, 23] . The virus titre for samples where no virus replication is observed, can be determined by using the Poisson distribution at 95% upper confidence limits. For the conversion to TCID 50 /ml, the concentration of virus particles is divided by ln 2. Therefore, if virus replication was below the limit of detection, a theoretical, though very low content of viruses had to be accepted (1.37 log 10 TCID 50 /ml for 1, 3, 5, 10, 20 min and 0.18 log 10 TCID 50 /ml for 30 min process time). The virus reduction factor, which quantitatively determines the capacity of the process step to inactivate viruses, was calculated from the ratio of the virus titre detectable in spiked OCTAGAM intermediate without SD and the virus titre potentially present after the SD step.",

Depending on the sample volume tested the detection limit varied between 1.37 log 10 TCID 50 /ml and 0.18 log 10 TCID 50 / ml. In both independently performed tests similar results were obtained. Taking into consideration the various handling procedures during the laboratory experiment (e.g. spike with virus, careful mixing of the virus-spiked intermediate, sterile sampling of an aliquot, dilution with cell culture medium for terminating the inactivation process), less than 1 min was required. The resulting log reduction factor is R5.75 G 0.25 log 10 TCID 50 /ml. Both virus stock controls and virus-spiked intermediate controls showed the expected values and demonstrated the validity of the study (Table 1 ). This means that the differences of the virus titre at the beginning and at the end of the incubation period was !0.5 log 10 TCID 50 /ml. Furthermore, the termination control confirmed that the 1:250 dilutions were more than sufficient to terminate the inactivation of SARS-CoV by SD (titre difference !0.5 log 10 TCID 50 /ml).

Nevertheless, it remains important to assess the possible risk for other modes of spread, for example via blood transfusion or application of therapeutic plasma products such as immunoglobulins. In general, the level and duration of viraemia and viral loads in plasma pools are critical parameters for risk assessment from emerging viruses. The risk of SARS-CoV transmission via blood or therapeutic plasma products seems remote, particularly because SARS-CoV viraemia does not seem to reach long-lasting high titres [16, 21] . In order to reduce the potential risk of SARS-CoV transmission by transfusion of cellular blood components, screening of blood donors by nucleic acid techniques (NAT), e.g. PCR, might be useful [21] . Furthermore, it is valuable to obtain information about the anti-SARS-CoV efficacy of virus inactivation steps like the SD procedure, which is widely used by many companies world-wide in the manufacture of therapeutic plasmaderived products including immunoglobulins. The acceptance of such pharmaceutical products does not rely on their therapeutic benefit alone, but to a large extent on their documented viral safety [13] . The SD method irreversibly disrupts the lipid coat of enveloped viruses and its associated binding sites under mild process conditions. The efficacy of the SD method has been extensively validated with human and model viruses, as weIl as by animal studies under both standard and robustness conditions of the product-specific manufacturing processes [1, 9, 17] . Due to the nonselective mode of action, the SD method is capable of inactivating not only the viruses of most concern, e.g. HIV, HBV and HCV, but also those viruses not tested for during routine screening at the blood collection centres, e.g. human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-1 C 2, HGV and CMV.",

In the case of SARS-CoV, several facts argued against its relevance in terms of plasma product safety. Firstly, as already mentioned, the reported SARS-CoV titres in plasma are low. Secondly, the extensive number of validation studies using other enveloped viruses indicates that any other enveloped virus, such as SARS-CoV, would become properly inactivated as well. On the other hand it could be shown that SARS-CoV has some differences in behaviour towards physicochemically noxa in comparison to other known human coronaviruses [18] , while it is easily destroyed by common disinfectants [19] . Thus, it is prudent to perform validation studies in order to confirm the safety hypothesis.",
