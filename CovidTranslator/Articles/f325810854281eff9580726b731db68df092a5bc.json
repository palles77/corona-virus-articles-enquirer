The H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 tested the capacities of countries to detect, assess, notify and report events as required by the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR). As detailed in the IHR, the World Health Organization drew on official reports from Member States as well as unofficial sources (e.g. media alerts) to quickly report and disseminate information about the appearance of the novel influenza virus. The pre-existing Global Influenza Surveillance Network for virological surveillance also provided crucial information for rapid development of a vaccine and for detection of changes in the virus. However, the pandemic also highlighted a number of shortcomings in global epidemiological surveillance for respiratory disease. These included the lack of standards for reporting illness, risk factor and mortality data, and a mechanism for systematic reporting of epidemiological data. Such measures would have facilitated direct comparison of data between countries and improved timely understanding of the characteristics and impact of the pandemic. This paper describes the surveillance strategies in place before the pandemic and the methods that were used at global level to monitor the pandemic. Enhancements of global surveillance are proposed to improve preparedness and response for similar events in the future.",

Its goal is to develop a global picture of the event through sharing and analysis of information provided by individual countries. This, in turn, results in a better understanding of key epidemiological, virological and clinical features of the pandemic; guides global prevention and control activities, such as equitable access to antivirals and vaccines; allows healthcare providers and public health authorities to modify national strategies for case management, community mitigation and health resource allocation upon consideration of their own and other countries' information and experience; and reduces the impact of inaccurate and unconfirmed rumours. 1 The global overview of past pandemics is very incomplete. Surveillance and epidemiological information about prior pandemics is available for some countries in varying levels of detail. This information was often determined decades later through painstaking retrospective research and analysis. 2e5 Much of this work was prompted by preparedness planning in advance of the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009.",

Systems of surveillance for seasonal influenza are typically found in medium-and well-resourced countries but are rare in less-resourced areas. In March 2009, a few weeks before the emergence of the H1N1 pandemic, 106 (54%) of 193 WHO Member States had no or very limited seasonal influenza surveillance capacity. A WHO review of 140 published national pandemic preparedness plans found that although many Member States had plans for the early detection and investigation of a pandemic, less than 20 countries had developed plans for ongoing monitoring throughout a pandemic.",

Under the IHR (2005), a number of reporting requirements oblige States Parties to promptly inform WHO of cases or events involving a wide range of diseases and public health risks including 'all cases of human influenza caused by a new virus subtype'. The official notification to WHO of cases or events likely to pose a serious international public health risk is done by a nationally appointed focal point (NFP) within 24 h of the country's assessment. WHO maintains a restricted-access website (event information system) to inform States about unusual events reported through the IHR and to convey WHO's assessment of their severity. The IHR also mandate WHO to perform public health surveillance, support States in their development of relevant capacities, and co-ordinate response activities to events that constitute an international public health risk. In extraordinary circumstances, the Director-General of WHO can determine that a 'public health emergency of international concern' is occurring. In this case, after taking advice from a committee of external experts (i.e. the Emergency Committee), the Director-General can issue 'temporary recommendations' to governments on the appropriate actions to prevent or reduce the international spread of the disease and minimize necessary interference with international traffic and trade. 10 The global influenza surveillance network For more than 60 years, the GISN has monitored influenza activity and characterized circulating influenza virus strains. These efforts are the critical underpinning to formulate recommendations each year for seasonal influenza vaccines and to provide prototype viral strains for vaccine production. In addition, the GISN functions as a global early warning system to detect unusual influenza strains which could have the potential to become human pandemic viruses.",

The NICs collect, identify and analyse influenza strains isolated from clinical specimens, and forward representative or unusual virus isolates to a WHO CC for detailed characterization. Although individual-level epidemiological or clinical data are not collected, NICs provide weekly reports to WHO of geographically-based influenza-like activity using FluNet, a web-based electronic interactive data reporting, query and mapping system. 11 In response to the challenges presented by the emergence and spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses in animals and humans, WHO established an ad-hoc network of H5 reference laboratories within the GISN in 2004. In addition, WHO worked with countries to expand the geographical coverage of the NICs. Both of these actions further enhanced the GISN's early detection capacity for novel viruses and reinforced the importance of co-ordinated animal and human health surveillance. However, despite the increase in the number of laboratories and expanded geographical coverage, influenza laboratory capacity in Africa was limited before the pandemic.",

In April 2009, the US Government notified WHO through the IHR system about a novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus that had been identified in specimens obtained in late March from two epidemiologically unlinked children living in southern California who had developed an acute febrile respiratory illness. 13, 15 On 23 April 2009, the National Microbiology Laboratory of the Public Health Agency of Canada determined that the influenza virus isolated from patients in Mexico was identical to the influenza A (H1N1) viruses from the two Californian patients. 13 The Mexican Ministry of Health immediately reported these findings to WHO. WHO, in turn, shared this critical information globally with IHR NFPs through the IHR information mechanism (i.e. event information system). Two days later, the WHO Director-General, after having convened the Emergency Committee under the IHR (2005), declared that the events constituted a public health emergency of international concern.

Sustained human-to-human transmission was soon documented in at least two countries (the USA and Mexico) in the same region, prompting WHO to raise the alert level to Phase 5 on 29 April 2009. WHO did not advise border closures or restrictions on international travel. 13 The first outbreak investigations found that a significant proportion of cases had no or minimal symptoms, reducing the likelihood that screening at border crossings would be effective. For the next several weeks, spread of the virus globally was documented through reporting of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths through IHR focal points in each newly affected country. Daily updates on the situation were issued on the WHO website during the first weeks of the pandemic.

These initial assessments were based in large part on reports from clinicians, public health officials and other experts during teleconferences organized by WHO with affected countries during the first weeks of the pandemic. 19e21 This information was critical for WHO to make a preliminary determination about the severity of the pandemic. The assessment of severity proved to be complex upon consideration of the multiple factors that influence the health effects of a pandemic: (1) the virological, epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the pandemic virus; (2) the vulnerability of the population, related in part to the level of pre-existing immunity to the virus in the population and the proportion of people who have medical or other conditions that may increase the risk for serious or fatal illness; and (3) the capacity of the population for response including access to care, risk communication, social mobilization, and advance planning and preparation. 22 Further complicating determination of the pandemic's severity was the limited availability of high-quality information at the time. For example, the case fatality ratio, although an important indicator of severity, proved particularly problematic because of incomplete information for both the number of deaths and the number of persons who had been infected, including those with mild disease. Severity-related parameters that were useful early in the pandemic included the proportion of cases that required hospitalization for treatment or required intensive care and mechanical ventilation, and the proportion of severe cases that occurred in previously healthy individuals without underlying risk factors. The impact on the healthcare system was reflected in hospital occupancy rates, the proportion of intensive care beds occupied by influenza cases, and the busyness of emergency rooms and outpatient treatment centres. However, few of these indicators of impact had historical data to place them in context, and the interpretation of the data depended somewhat on anecdotal reports. Most of this information was not available through routine information systems but was obtained through ad-hoc data collection.",

Artificially low case and death counts may have contributed to the perception that WHO and countries 'over-reacted' or have dissuaded persons at increased risk of severe disease to delay seeking care or elect not be immunized.",

WHO has defined standards for reporting of fatal influenza-related cases and risk factors, as well as data collection and reporting standards for SARIs and risk factors. Such efforts should improve comparability of data at the global level. An online system of epidemiological influenza data reporting is under development; when implemented, the system will allow countries to report data directly into a database that also contains virological and demographic data. The system will also allow countries without formal surveillance systems to report informal assessments of respiratory disease activity. Both epidemiological and virological data will be available on a WHO global influenza monitoring platform that will display influenza surveillance information provided by countries.",

Sentinel-based surveillance for SARI has application for both seasonal and pandemic settings, 36, 37 can serve as a flexible platform for monitoring other respiratory pathogens, provide useful baseline data on severe disease, identify those at highest risk for severe disease, and provide infrastructure needed for response to acute public health events. The utility of influenza surveillance is closely connected to the availability of adequate laboratory capacity. Although progress has been made in increasing the geographic reach of NICs and improving their capacity for diagnosing influenza, 38 there remain notable gaps in access to quality testing, especially in Africa. Further, the development of reliable, inexpensive, fast and easy-to-use point-of-care methods for laboratory testing to detect influenza and other common respiratory pathogens could reduce the burden on NICs and other reference laboratories, especially in the setting of a pandemic.",

The virological information about the pandemic virus collected through the GISN, for example, was easier to collect than the epidemiological information for which WHO had no pre-established system or standards in place. Clinical information was collected through an ad-hoc mechanism at the global level p u b l i c h e a l t h 1 2 5 ( 2 0 1 1 ) 2 4 7 e2 5 6 and sometimes at the country level as well; such an approach was time and resource consuming.
