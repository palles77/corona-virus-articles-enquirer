The expert logs in to the BioCaster portal and enters H5N1 avian influenza as the search term along with Vietnam, the date range of interest and requests only English language news articles. Internally BioCaster recognizes that the first term is an English variant of a root-term in its disease concept hierarchy highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza and that there are a number of English synonyms such as H5N1 disease, HPAI (H5N1) and A(H5N1) flu which it can use to expand the query. The search is performed but the results are not relevant to the user's information need. The system then offers the user the choice of searching using related symptoms which are based on the <hasSymptom> relation as well as the pathogenic agent found by the <causedBy> relation. The user selects this option and the search is performed again using symptoms such as cough, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress and the agent name influenza A virus subtype H5N1. This time an article is found but the report is already 2 weeks out of date and missing some vital pieces of information about the name of the location. The user then chooses to search the Vietnamese news and the search is repeated using Vietnamese term equivalents. After the system retrieves the Vietnamese news, a structured translation is generated for each event summarizing mined information in English by following the <isSynonymOf> relation to the root term and from there the <preferredTerm> is found for English. Each term is given in its <preferred-Term> form, making events easier to compare. The expert then finds the event that she is searching for where the location name is clearly identified. In this scenario the system has helped the user to quickly find relevant information by expanding the query with semantically related terms and also to cross the language barrier.",

Textual content in biomedicine, especially in news reports, exhibits considerable variability which needs to be systematized. A plethora of major nomenclatures and classification systems already exist that we can draw on including GALEN Core (Rector et al. 1995) , SNOMED CT (Stearns et al. 2001) , and the Unified Medical Language System (Lindberg et al. 1993) , each with varying degrees of rigor, coverage and accessibility. Most of these are monolingual domain ontologies with a scope far broader and deeper than the application ontology we have in mind for BCO.

The basic unit of class is the synset which aims to group words and expressions with the same meaning in a given context. Synsets are related through hyponym, hyperonym, meronym and various other relations. As the structuring of WordNets is essentially language dependent, EuroWordNet provides a bridge between language specific WordNets by adopting Inter-Lingual-Index (ILIs) for relating synsets in different languages. However EuroWordNet was not intended to be domain specific and as such it lacks depth of terminological coverage and more importantly domain-specific relations. Our purpose on the other hand is to make explicit the relations between the disease, the pathogenic agent, the typical location of incidence, symptoms and the mode of transmission. We take inspiration from EuroWordNet in several areas such as the use of a top level structure that is broadly similar and the use of a mediating node which we call a root term. Where we differ is by setting the role of the root term to be both the container linking synonyms across languages and also in being the object to which various domain sensitive relations point. By using the root term essentially as an interlingual pivot, we simplify the construction and maintenance of domain-specific relations.",

It has many valuable resources for our purpose such as lists of infectious diseases and their relations to symptoms, transmission agents and pathogens. Two potential disadvantages though are that its links encode a variety of association relations and the entries themselves may vary in quality, timeliness and coverage due to an open editorial system (Giles 2005) . Categorization of articles may also not necessarily strictly reflect ontological principals. Naturally also the entries are written for human readers and require structuring.

This is a detailed and widely used coding system for diseases published by the World Health Organization with various national extensions. Diseases are structured within a classification and given with diagnosis and a unique code. One point of concern is that we need to take care to consider the level of granularity that is practical for terms that will appear in the news sources. For example ICD10 makes fine-grained distinctions between four classes of tuberculosis which in turn have 38 subclasses. Issues are also raised by how ICD-10 partitions the domain where terms are often composite entities incorporating a disease base plus a condition and can also include underspecification (Bodenreider et al. 2004 ).",

It provides extensive coverage of notifiable diseases and their causal agents in the US. There are some points of divergence though with our approach: (a) the coding system supports only English and is focussed on terminology applicable to the US situation, (b) the relations sometimes lack rigor, e.g. there are separate subtrees for organisms whose role is Vector and transmission_mode_values which includes vector borne but nothing to relate the two, as well as underspecified relations such as associated substances, (c) the terminology coverage does not directly include synonyms although this may be recoverable from the links to controlled vocabularies.",

The SUMO ontology provides very general classes such as an Entity with subclasses Attribute, Quantity, Object, and Process giving a potential source of integration with other ontologies. SUMO also includes a much more extensive taxonomy and a rich axiomization in both SUO-KIF and OWL full. For our purpose SUMO's hierarchy was simplified in order to remove superfluous details by requiring all nonleaf classes to have at least two children. One potential difficulty we noted with SUMO is that it was not so clear how to relate some of our event classes (e.g. outbreak) under Process (perdurant) as the subclassification here is not exhaustive and does not cover some event types. Since most of the taxonomy we have developed so far pertains to objects (endurants) a discussion of this will be left for future work.",

For example the multilingual correspondence between translations of weakness and fatigue are shown in Fig. 2 .
