As a result, a mutation on the maternal X-chromosome gene might not exist in the paternal X-chromosome gene in humans. X-chromosome inactivation provides dosage compensation for X-linked genes between XX females and XY males. In a random process, one of the two X chromosomes is transcriptionally silenced early in female development, which leads to the mosaic expression of either the maternal (Xm) or paternal (Xp) X chromosome in different cell populations. Thus, as a result of X-inactivation, potentially half of the cells express an X-linked gene mutation in females, whereas all cells in males express an X-linked gene mutation. For example, a mutation in the \u03b3-chain subunit that is common to receptors for interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21, causes X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID) 10 , a disease that was originally identified in a family of genetically related males 11 .

As a general rule, females exhibit more robust cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to antigenic challenges, such as infection and vaccination, compared with males. oestrogens, such as 17\u03b2-oestradiol (also known as E2) and oestriol, progesterone and testosterone, can mediate many of the sex-based differences in immune responses 16 . oestrogens exert their effects by binding to cognate intracellular receptors. The two subtypes of the receptor for oestrogens, oestrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1; also known as ESR1) and ER\u03b2 (also known as ESR2), are expressed by many types of immune cell, including T cells, B cells, dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, neutrophils and natural killer (NK) cells, which suggests that oestrogens might have a role in the regulation of immunocompetence (Fig. 2 ). oestrogen-ER\u03b1 or -ER\u03b2 complexes translocate to the nucleus, where they bind to distinct ER-responsive elements in the promoters of target genes, thereby regulating transcriptional activity. In addition, oestrogen-ER\u03b1 or oestrogen-ER\u03b2 complexes might regulate the transcriptional activity of genes that do not have an ER-responsive element by recruiting co-regulatory proteins that can activate or repress transcription 17 . Interestingly, ligands for ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 exert different influences on the course of EAE. more specifically, treatment with either an ER\u03b1 ligand or with 17\u03b2-oestradiol (which binds to both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2) is anti-inflammatory and abrogates the onset of EAE, whereas treatment with a specific ER\u03b2 ligand is neuroprotective but not anti-inflammatory 18 .",

For multiple sclerosis, recent evidence from EAE models suggests that the decrease in disease activity during pregnancy is probably associated with an immunoregulatory environment rather than with the suppression of T H 1-cell responses 27 . These findings have led to the initiation of several pilot clinical studies to examine the effects of oestriol therapy in multiple sclerosis 28 . Notably, the remission of rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis during pregnancy is often followed by a flare of disease activity post-partum, when oestrogen and progesterone levels fall 29, 30 .",

Oestrogens, such as 17\u03b2-oestradiol, exert a biphasic effect on t helper (t H )-cell polarization: low levels promote t H 1-cell differentiation and higher levels promote t H 2-cell polarization, with consequent effects on the production of cytokines that are associated with each of the t H -cell populations. Oestrogen increases the size of the t reg -cell population. In addition, oestrogen increases cc-chemokine receptor 1 (ccr1) and ccr5 expression and decreases tumour-necrosis factor (tNF) production by cD4 + t cells. Oestrogen decreases the negative selection of naive B cells, enhances the survival of autoreactive B cells and enhances polyclonal B-cell activation and immunoglobulin production. the inhibition of cD16 expression by oestrogen in monocytes and macrophages leads to the reduced production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 (IL-1\u03b2), IL-6 and tNF. In neutrophils, oestrogen upregulates the production of nitric-oxide synthase and nitric oxide, thereby promoting their anti-inflammatory effects, and decreases their chemotactic activity. Oestrogen promotes the differentiation of conventional Dcs (cDcs) from bone-marrow-derived Dc precursors (BMDcs), and increases their IL-12 production, whereas exposure of mature splenic Dcs to oestrogen results in the expansion of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3)-producing killer Dcs. 17\u03b2-oestradiol treatment increases the secretion of IL-6, IL-8 and cc-chemokine ligand 2 (ccL2) by immature Dcs (iDcs).

The presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 in the affected tissues of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis 44 and SLE 45 has been associated with increased aromatase activity and a corresponding acceleration in the synthesis of oestrogens.

            "text": "Data from rodent studies do, however, provide some insights into the mechanisms that contribute to sex-based differences in disease severity. Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection is associated with myocarditis 47 , and although men and women are equally susceptible to CVB3 infection, the cardioprotective effects of oestrogens have been linked to a lower incidence of heart disease in women 48 . Accumulating data indicate that the differences in the severity of myocarditis between the sexes are not limited to differences in the levels of viral replication in the heart, but are attributable to differences in the immune response to infection 49, 50 . The higher levels of oestrogens in women decrease the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas the more robust proinflammatory immune response to CVB3 infection in males increases inflammation in the heart. Recent data from mouse studies suggest that oestrogens mediate a decrease in the numbers of mast cells and macrophages in the infected hearts of females, with associated upregulation of T-cell immunoglobulin domain and mucin domain-3 (TIm3; also Nature Reviews | Immunology known as HAVCR2) by these cells. In turn, TIm3 inhibits TLR4 expression, thereby regulating the inflammatory response, and increases the size of the T Reg -cell population. By contrast, infected male hearts show increased numbers of mast cells and macrophages with high expression of TLR4. This TLR4 expression in males inhibits downregulation of the inflammatory response and decreases TIm3 expression, thereby reducing the size of the T Reg -cell population and inhibiting TIm3-mediated apoptosis 50 . Similar to CVB3 infection in humans, male and female rats are equally susceptible to infection with the hantavirus Seoul virus, but females mount a more robust immune response to infection that results in decreased viral shedding and a lower viral load in target organs 51 . An analysis of the lungs of hantavirus-infected female rats revealed a pattern of gene expression that is associated with a robust innate antiviral immune response, namely increased levels of genes that encode microbial pattern recognition receptors, IFN\u03b2 and IFN-inducible signalling effectors, compared with the lungs of infected male rats 52 . Human studies indicate that more males than females are infected with hantaviruses 53 , which perhaps indicates that the more rigorous innate immune response that was identified in infected female rats also occurs in humans. moreover, hantavirusinfected females had significantly higher plasma levels of IL-9 and lower levels of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CXCL8 and CXCL10 than males, which further supports the existence of sex-dependent differences in immune responses to viral infections 54 . Studies in mice suggest that sex-based differences in the susceptibility to viral infections of the central nervous system (CNS), such as VSV, also correspond to enhanced immunity in the CNS in females and are associated with recovery from this neurotropic viral infection 55 . Finally, although age was an important predictor of mortality from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the virus outbreak in 2003, females had lower mortality rates than males, even after adjusting for age. It is tempting to speculate that a more robust innate antiviral immune response in females might have accounted for this reduced mortality rate 56 .",

The susceptibility of the mucosal surface of the female genital tract to infection with both HIV and HSV-2 is influenced by oestrogen and progesterone levels. Specifically, progesterone is protective and decreases viral shedding, whereas oestrogens increase viral shedding 61, 62 . In the context of HIV infection, levels of viral RNA in the plasma are consistently lower in women than men.

For several viral infections, susceptibility is identical among men and women. However, fluctuations in oestrogen and progesterone levels directly affect immune responses at mucosal tissues, thereby influencing female susceptibility to sexually transmitted viral infections. The effects of oestrogens on cytokine and chemokine production promote an anti-inflammatory environment, which offers females protection from the immunopathology that is associated with certain viral infections. Notably, the changes in oestrogen levels in women that are determined by ovarian activity directly influence the profile of the immune response; low oestrogen levels are associated with a T H 1-cell polarized response, which is linked to the production of cytokines with antiviral activity, whereas high oestrogen levels are associated with T H 2-cell polarization and the production of cytokines that promote humoral immunity. The more vigorous humoral immune response in females is also a consequence of the direct effects of oestrogens on B-cell function, which enhances neutralizing antibody production and thereby assists in viral clearance.",

The severity of secondary cases may relate to higher virus absorption that is associated with a higher infective dose 65 . In certain societies, fatality rates of measles cases are higher for females than for males, as girls remain at home and are therefore at a higher risk of infection from siblings inside the home. In addition, males can contract the disease outside the home and pass on the secondary, more severe infection to the females who remain inside the home 62 .

Specifically, compensatory effects of sex chromosome complement and sex hormones on an autoantigen-specific immune response were observed in a study of mice deficient in the testis-determinant Sry gene, which allowed the production of mice that differ in sex-chromosome complement while having the same gonadal type, and which used gonadectomization to address sex hormone influences 66 .",

            "text": "So far, drug development has proceeded without the consideration of sex-based differences in disease susceptibility or severity, which is particularly unfortunate as identification of sex-dependent factors could reveal potential new therapeutic targets. moreover, drug development has so far not adequately addressed the accumulating evidence that suggests that sex-based differences affect pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (BOX 1) . Antiretroviral therapies for HIV exemplify this, as various studies of these drugs have shown that women have more frequent and serious adverse events than men 67 , which is probably a consequence of sex-based differences in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antiretroviral drugs 68 . overall, women are at a greater risk of suffering from adverse drug reactions from medications that are already on the market as a result of their under-representation in clinical trials and owing to the lack of detailed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies that are sufficiently powered to detect sex-based effects. Published data on drug efficacy segregated by sex is also lacking. For example, data regarding sex-based differences in viroimmunologic outcomes in HIVinfected men and women on antiretroviral therapy are inconclusive, largely because these studies are underpowered to detect these differences [69] [70] [71] .",

Disease-specific tissue biobanks in which individual patients provide multiple specimens over the course of disease offer the added advantage of allowing for the analysis of sex-dependent differences in the context of hormonal fluctuations in females. Prospective banking therefore requires that data on the phase of the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, contraception use and hormonereplacement therapy must be acquired when tissue specimens are collected from females. Future studies must address sexbased differences in immune responses to infectious and autoimmune diseases in all aspects of scientific inquiry and make these considerations a priority for comprehensive and effective health care. The responsibility resides with health-research funding agencies, including federal government drug-licensing agencies, to insist that research investigations are stratified to include sex-dependent analyses.
