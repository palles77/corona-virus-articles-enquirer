In the 1800s, the slow march of the second cholera pandemic could be observed to follow trade and military campaign routes out of India to Central Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and eventually North America, over the course of years. 5 Today, by contrast, infectious diseases can traverse the globe in less than a day. [6] [7] [8] With improvements in the availability of and access to various modes of transportation over the past several decades and the resultant decreases in time required to reach destinations, an outbreak in an isolated location can pose an international threat. 5 It is generally assumed that increased numbers of international travelers will increase global vulnerability to infectious diseases, by enhancing the potential for geographic spread.

Increased travel between two countries with strong health care and public health systems will likely have very different implications for global health security than increased travel between countries with less developed infrastructure or countries with disparities in their capacities to respond to public health threats. For instance, an increase in travelers to more vulnerable countries may increase the likelihood of exportation of cases to other countries, thereby increasing the rapidity of global transmission. However, if the countries to which the disease is exported have suitable health capacity, the risk of establishment and ongoing transmission may be less of a concern, 9 albeit nonnegligible. 10 Increased connectivity also increases the likelihood of introduction of pathogens via infected tourists to less resilient countries, where disease establishment is a risk. 11 To better understand the impact of globalization on our ability to mitigate infectious disease threats, we sought to describe trends in air passenger numbers over a 10-year period (2007-2016) and investigate if connectivity between countries with different levels of resilience has changed over this time period.",

As of 2016, the Index included 178 sovereign states. Countries are ranked on 12 indicators.

Of the 12 indicators, 4 are categorized as social, 2 as economic, and 6 as political.

Travel between countries included in the FSI rankings represented 95% (1.28 billion out of 1.35 billion) of all international trips in 2016. We excluded South Sudan from these analyses, as FSI data were only available from 2012 onwards. South Sudan is classified as an Alert country and travel to and from this country accounted for less than 0.03% of annual passenger flows. Analyses were conducted using either inbound or outbound passenger numbers, but are presented for outbound passenger numbers only, as the inbound and outbound passenger volumes did not differ significantly (paired T-test, p=0.62).",

In particular, although there has been an increase in travel from the most vulnerable Alert countries, the overall amount of travel from these countries is small, relative to overall passenger volumes.

Quantifying a country's ability to detect and respond to infectious disease threats is challenging, as there is a constellation of complex and evolving socioeconomic, political, and environmental factors that contribute to that ability. The FSI and other indices attempt to distill these multidimensional factors into a single metric, which of necessity will be a relatively crude approximation. Unlike other such indices, 12, 13 the FSI is unique because it captures year-to-year changes, allowing us compare changes in each country's Fragility over time. 14 The use of the FSI does come with limitations. The data are also not available for all countries, limiting the scope of the analyses. The classification of countries into 4 categories based on numeric scores, while useful for communicating and understanding the risk levels, may reduce power to detect trends in the data.

There was a trend of decreased fragility over the 10-year time period, with FSI values decreasing by 0.23 (95% CI: -0.34, -0.11) points per year. Comparing 2007 and 2016, a total of 23 countries (13%) had a change in FSI category, with the remaining 154 countries remaining in the same category at both time points. Although the number of countries with a change in category was relatively small, many countries did experience changes in their numeric FSI scores. Between 2007 and 2016, 44 countries (25%) had an increase in their FSI score of 5% or more, indicating increasing fragility, with Libya (+26.3 points), Syria (+20.5 points), and Mali (+17.3 points) experiencing the largest increases in fragility. Over this same period, 70 countries (40%) Trends in connectivity based on national resilience Between 2007 and 2016 there was an absolute increase in outbound passengers for all FSI categories (Figure 2). The largest number of passengers travelled from Stable countries, which experienced a non-significant increase of 298,554 passengers per year (95%CI: -481,794 to 1,078,903). The Alert category had a total increase of 47,022 passengers per year (95%CI: 523 to 93,520), the Warning category had a total increase of 260,420 passengers per year (95%CI: 123,645 to 397,195), and the Sustainable category had a total increase of 872,469 passengers per year (95%CI: 286,761 to",

Despite the robust overall trend of increasing air travel over time, we also observe a relation between increasing FSI (i.e., increasing vulnerability) and reductions in air travel, suggesting that changes in individual country's vulnerability does have repercussions for air travel connectivity. In addition to the population health implications of changes in the destination and volume of international travellers, our findings are also important for individual traveler health. With an increase in the number of visitors to Alert and Warning countries, the number of travel-related exported infectious cases with epidemic potential may increase. This, in turn, may affect tourist industries, resulting in human and economic losses. 22",
