In this study the radiofrequency (RF) sputter technique was used to deposit a defective titanium dioxide (TiO x , x b 2) photocatalyst thin film (120 nm thickness) on glass and steel substrates. In the ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectrum analysis, the defective TiO x thin film was found to generate the red shift effect. To determine whether the defective TiO x thin film has antibacterial ability under visible light, we designed a series of experiments according to the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) Committee standard for testing antibacterial performance and for exploring the impact of surface roughness of substrate. Our results show that the antibacterial performance rate against Escherichia coli could reach 99.99% in visible light. We also proved that the coating technology can be applied effectively to surfaces with different degrees of roughness. It is suitable for protecting both human health and the natural environment. D",

Several studies have concluded that titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) photocatalyst is capable of deactivating the SARS virus with high efficiency. For this reason, much effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanism and fabrication methods of photocatalysts. In 1972 Fujishima and Honda successfully fabricated TiO 2 ceramic nanoparticles that can be used in photocatalytic reactors for degrading contaminants in water and air [1] . To effectively detoxify noxious organic pollutants the semiconductor photocatalyst generally requires ultraviolet (UV) light as the excitant source; the reason is that UV energy is greater than the band gap of the semiconductor, and it will deduce the electron hole pairs generated when the semiconductor is illuminated by UV. The electrons subsequently react with O 2 in the sample to form superoxide radicals, while the holes react with the surface OH groups to form OH radicals. These radicals attack the organic molecule, which is eventually oxidized to become CO 2 , H 2 O, and HCl, thus achieving an antibacterial effect.",

            "text": "It is widely known that TiO 2 photocatalysts have minimal antibacterial efficacy in visible light. Therefore, it became essential to develop a new photocatalyst that could be excited by visible light. Briefly, there are three ways to modify photocatalysts while working within the spectrum of No financial conflict of interest was reported by the authors of this paper. visible light. One is by dropping the metal elements into the ceramal material and then exciting this photocatalyst in visible light. For example, Zou's team discovered that TiO 4 doped with nickel would be excited by visible light; alternatively, they doped with platinum to enhance water splitting [2] [3] [4] . The second approach is by doping the transition elements into the UV photocatalyst to create the red shift effect [5] . For example, TiO 2 ceramal-doped transition elements were used to prepare a visible light photocatalyst with decreasing band gap energy [6, 7] . That is to say, when the transition elements are doped into TiO 2 the TiO x structure (x b 2) would then be formed, and the red shift could be achieved by reducing the highest occupied molecular orbital gap energy. Unfortunately, thermal instability and short half-life are its disadvantages. The third way is to change the structure of the photocatalyst by the defection effect, thus achieving surface adsorption in visible light [8] . This approach has many advantages, such as thermal stability, ease of fabrication, and large red shift [9] .",

The photocatalyst has a high surface-to-volume ratio (S/V) to promote its antibacterial action. That is, the volume of photocatalyst must be small. For example, the diameter of nanoparticles is smaller than the human sweat duct (b 10 nm) and may have untoward effects on the human body when the photocatalyst penetrates into skin via breathing or touching. For this reason, Rochester's researcher indicated that the metabolic mechanism of nanoparticles in the human body must be addressed. Our defective TiO x (x b 2) photocatalyst thin film has an excellent mechanical function and is effective against both viruses and bacteria under the visible light spectrum. Further details will be reported in this study.",

            "text": "The semiconductor photocatalyst is excited by the appropriate electromagnetic wave to produce electron and hole pairs. The electron combines with O 2 to produce superoxide free radicals, and the hole captures the electron from H 2 O in air to generate hydroxyl free radicals. Both free radicals have powerful bonding ability with bacteria and fungi. Therefore, bacteria and fungi will be suppressed with DNA damaged by superoxide and hydroxyl free radicals [10] . The defective lattice TiO x structure was usually fabricated by doping nitrogen into pure TiO 2 during the sputter process [11] . Because the strength of O-H bonding on metal oxides depends on the electronegative property of the metal ions, it is presumed that the N-H bonding is weaker than the O-H bonding (electronegative property of nitrogen is 3.0, oxygen is 3.5). Therefore, the N-H sites of the nitrogen-doped TiO 2 surface act as acidic sites, and the defective lattice structure TiO 2 -x N x is obtained. The structure shows adsorption in the spectrum of visible light [12] . In this work we used argon to replace nitrogen in the RF sputter process. Because the ion of argon has no electronegativity, it can barely bond with ionic oxygen, even though the plasma has high energy. That is, the large argon ion occupied the position of oxygen during the composition process of TiO 2 . Consequently, the thin film was altered to be TiO x (x b 2) photocatalyst, and its absorption spectrum has a larger red shift than pure TiO 2 . In this work the method of defection effect is used to produce a defective photocatalyst thin film that shows the characteristic of visible adsorption.",

The survival rate of E. coli on defective photocatalyst thin film was 49.3% (ABI of 1.3) after being exposed for 1 hour; that is, only 50.7% of E. coli would be restrained. The survival rate of E. coli on anatase-TiO 2 nanoparticles was 57% (ABI of 1.7). That is to say, the antibacterial performance rate of defective TiO x thin film is about 1.17-fold that of the anatase-TiO 2 nanoparticle after 1 hour. However, 3 hours later both samples reached the same survival rate of 3%. After 5 hours the value was below 0.01%; thus the antibacterial performance rate was above 99.99% for both samples. In contrast, the survival rate of bacteria in the dark field was 92%, for both samples at any time. Thus we proved that the defective photocatalyst thin film has the same antibacterial ability as the anatase-TiO 2 nanoparticle.",

            "text": "The surface of a steel substrate is generally always rougher than that of glass, and its real contact area with air is also larger than that of glass. Thus it was uncertain whether the defective TiO x photocatalyst thin film coated onto the steel surface would have greater antibacterial ability than when coated onto other surfaces of varying roughness. Thus we examined the ABI with substrates of varying surface roughness, including steel and glass. The excitant light source was replaced by four 15-W fluorescent lamps (in visible light). The results of the experiment are shown in Figure 6 . The survival rate of E. coli with a steel substrate was 69%, whereas that for glass was 49.3%, after the samples were exposed for 1 hour. After exposure for 5 hours, the survival rate with a steel substrate was less than 1%; thus the antibacterial performance rate was greater than 99%, and the corresponding ABI value is 1.69. The survival rate with the glass substrate is about 0.01%; thus the antibacterial performance rate can reach 99.99%, and the corresponding ABI value is 1.84. Although there is a small difference in the deviation of the ABI values corresponding to steel and glass respectively, the substrate roughness effect is still very slight. For comparison, the sample of anatase-TiO 2 nanoparticle was also exposed under the same light source. The results are also shown in Figure 6 . It can be seen here that the survival rate of E. coli is still greater than 50% after a 5-hour exposure; that is, the anatase-TiO 2 nanoparticle has lower antibacterial efficiency in visible light than the defective TiO x photocatalyst thin film. In addition to the low antibacterial efficiency, the optimal value of ABI was only 1.3 after 5 hours. This is in contrast to the excellent performance of the defective TiO x photocatalyst thin film, regardless of the roughness of the coating. Moreover, to determine whether the defective TiO x thin film has the ability to kill bacteria we measured the KBI of the defective TiO x thin film (with glass substrate) and obtained the KBI from Eq. (3). The value was 0.22 in the UV experiment, whereas it was about 0.075 in the visible light experiment. These results led us to speculate that the chief agent responsible for killing bacteria is probably UV light and not the photocatalyst effect. Therefore, the defective TiO x photocatalyst thin film shows an excellent antibacterial ability, but it is an inefficient killer of bacteria. In addition to the issues already discussed, we are studying the influence of the thickness of the thin film on the antibacterial capacity. Furthermore, the friction effect is one of the most important variables and must be taken into account in industrial applications.",
