Moreover, many targets have proven to be intractable to traditional small-molecule and protein approaches. Therapeutics based on RNA interference (RNAi) offer a powerful method for rapidly identifying specific and potent inhibitors of disease targets from all molecular classes. Numerous proof-of-concept studies in animal models of human disease demonstrate the broad potential application of RNAi therapeutics. The major challenge for successful drug development is identifying delivery strategies that can be translated to the clinic. With advances in this area and the commencement of multiple clinical trials with RNAi therapeutic candidates, a transformation in modern medicine may soon be realized.",

In sharp contrast, siRNAs naturally lack these drug-like properties owing to their large size (two turns of a nucleic acid double helix), nearly 40 anionic charges due to the phosphodiester backbone, and high molecular weight (over 13 kDa). In aqueous solution, with their sugar-phosphate backbone exposed to water, siRNAs are extremely hydrophilic and heavily hydrated. Furthermore, siRNAs are unstable in serum as a result of degradation by serum nucleases, contributing to their short half-lives in vivo 7 . Although the molecular weight of siRNAs cannot be reduced, these molecules can be made more 'drug-like' through judicious use of chemical modification to the sugars, backbone or bases of the oligoribonucleotides.",

The reduction in expression of pathological proteins through RNAi is applicable to all classes of molecular targets, including those that are difficult to modulate selectively with traditional pharmaceutical approaches involving small molecules or proteins. Consequently, RNAi therapeutics as a drug class have the potential to exert a transformational effect on modern medicine. In RNAi, the target mRNA is enzymatically cleaved, leading to decreased abundance of the corresponding protein, and specificity is a key feature of the mechanism. Synthetic small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) leverage the naturally occurring RNAi process in a manner that is consistent and predictable with regard to extent and duration of action. In addition, viral delivery of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) represents an alternative strategy for harnessing RNAi. Both nonviral delivery of siRNAs and viral delivery of shRNAs are being advanced as potential RNAi-based therapeutic approaches.",

We summarize the numerous publications to date demonstrating the robust efficacy of RNAi in animal models of human disease upon direct (local) as well as systemic administration. These proof-of-concept studies support RNAi as the basis for a new therapeutic approach that has the potential to change the treatment of human disease.

Stability against nuclease degradation has been achieved by introducing a phosphorothioate (P=S) backbone linkage at the 3\u2032 end for exonuclease resistance and 2\u2032 modifications (2\u2032-OMe, 2\u2032-F and related) for endonuclease resistance [8] [9] [10] . An siRNA motif, consisting entirely of 2\u2032-O-methyl and 2\u2032-fluoro nucleotides, has enhanced plasma stability and increased in vitro potency. At one site, this motif shows >500-fold improvement in potency over the unmodified siRNA 11 . Using phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) as a target, the effect of 2\u2032 sugar modifications such as 2\u2032-fluoro-2\u2032-deoxynucleoside (2\u2032-F), 2\u2032-Omethyl (2\u2032-O-Me) and 2\u2032-O-(2-methoxyethyl) (2\u2032-O-MOE) in the guide and nonguide strands was evaluated in HeLa cells. The activity depends on the position of the modification in the guide-strand sequence. The siRNAs with modified residues at the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand seem to be less active than those modified at the 3\u2032 end. The 2\u2032-F sugar is generally well tolerated on the guide strand, whereas the 2\u2032-O-MOE modification results in loss of activity regardless of placement position in the construct. The incorporation of 2\u2032-O-Me and 2\u2032-O-MOE in the nonguide strand of siRNA does not have a notable effect on activity 12 . Sugar modifications such as 2\u2032-O-Me, 2\u2032-F and locked nucleic acid (LNA, with a methylene bridge connecting 2\u2032 and 4\u2032 carbons) seem to be able to reduce the immunostimulatory effects of siRNAs (see below).",

In the boranophosphate linkage, a nonbridging phosphodiester oxygen is replaced by an isoelectronic borane (BH 3 -) moiety. Boranophosphate siRNAs have been synthesized by enzymatic routes using T7 RNA polymerase and a boranophosphate ribonucleoside triphosphate in the transcription reaction. Boranophosphate siRNAs are more active than native siRNAs if the center of the guide strand is not modified, and they may be at least ten times more nuclease resistant than unmodified siRNAs 17,18 . siRNA duplexes containing the 2,4-difluorotoluyl ribonucleoside (rF) were synthesized to evaluate the effect of noncanonical nucleoside mimetics on RNA interference. Thermal melting analysis showed that the base pair between rF and adenosine is destabilizing relative to a uridine-adenosine pair, although it is slightly less destabilizing than other mismatches. The crystal structure of a duplex containing rF-adenosine pairs shows local structural variations relative to a canonical RNA helix. As the fluorine atoms cannot act as hydrogen bond acceptors and are more hydrophobic than uridine, a well-ordered water structure is not seen around the rF residues in both grooves. Rapid amplification of 5 complementary DNA ends (5\u2032-RACE) analysis confirms cleavage of target mRNA opposite to the rF placement site 19, 20 .",

Several groups have subsequently developed more sophisticated extensions of these largely empirical criteria, leading to the development of algorithms for siRNA design 23, 24 . Recent biochemical studies of the molecular mechanism of RNA interference have highlighted some key features of potent siRNA duplexes (Fig. 3) . Most notably, it has been found that the efficiency with which the guide strand is incorporated into the RISC complex is perhaps the most important factor determining siRNA potency. Because siRNA duplexes are symmetric, the question arose of how the RISC machinery is able to determine which strand to use for target silencing. Insight into this enigma came from careful analyses of microRNAs (miRNAs), the endogenous counterparts of siRNAs. Examination of the sequences of a large number of vertebrate and invertebrate miRNA precursor sequences showed that the predicted thermodynamic stabilities of the two ends of the duplex are unequal 25, 26 . Specifically, calculating the \u2206G for the several base pairs at each end of the duplex revealed that the 5\u2032 end of the mature miRNA pairs less tightly with the carrier strand than does the 3\u2032 end. In short, miRNA precursors show thermodynamic asymmetry. It was hypothesized that components of the RISC machinery select the guide strand based on this asymmetry.",

They found that the RISC machinery preferentially incorporates the strand whose 5\u2032 end binds less tightly with the other strand. In fact, strand selection could be switched by making a single nucleotide substitution at the end of the duplex to alter relative binding of the ends. A similar conclusion was reached by another group based on in vitro screening of a large collection of siRNAs with varying potency 26, 27 .

Transcriptional profiling studies have confirmed that siRNA duplexes can potentially silence multiple genes in addition to the intended target. As expected, genes in these so called off-target 'signatures' contain regions that are complementary to one of the two strands in the siRNA duplex [28] [29] [30] . More detailed bioinformatic analyses have revealed that the regions of complementarity are most often found in the 3\u2032 UTRs of the off-target genes 31 . This immediately suggested a microRNA-like mechanism, because miRNAs generally interact with the 3\u2032 UTR region of their targets. Evidence in support of this concept came from a closer look at the determinants of siRNA off-targeting. It was discovered that sequence complementarity between the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand and the mRNA is the key to off-target silencing 31, 32 . The critical nucleo- tides were found to be positions 2-8, counting from the 5\u2032 end of the guide strand (Fig. 3) . This corresponds to the so-called 'seed region' of miRNAs, which has been shown to determine miRNA specificity 33 .",

Even if the homology is restricted to the 3\u2032 UTR, it may prove difficult to identify siRNA duplexes satisfying the criteria of potency and specificity. As one alternative, recent published work has reported that off-targeting can be substantially reduced by chemical modification of nucleotides within the seed region 34 . Specifically, the introduction of a 2\u2032-O-Me modification into nucleotides within the seed region was shown to inactivate the off-target activity of the siRNA without compromising silencing of the intended mRNA. In fact, introduction of the modification at a single nucleotide position (position 2, Fig. 3 ) is sufficient to suppress the majority of off-targeting. The mechanism, anticipated by recently published crystal structure data, appears to involve perturbation of RISC interaction with the modified nucleotide.",

            "text": "Another system for which there have been multiple examples of efficacious local delivery of siRNA is the eye, where proof of concept has been successfully achieved in animal models of ocular neovascularization and scarring using saline and lipid formulations [44] [45] [46] . Intravitreal injection of siRNA targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1, formulated in phosphate-buffered saline, was effective in reducing the area of ocular neovascularization by one-third to two-thirds in two mouse models 44 . In addition, siRNAs targeting VEGF and the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor type II, formulated with TransIT-TKO, were injected directly into the mouse eye, resulting in inhibition of laser photocoagulation-induced choroidal neovascularization 45 and latex bead-induced collagen deposition and inflammatory cell infiltration 46 , respectively. As with the lung, multiple siRNA formulations were effective in the eye. These encouraging proof-of-concept studies in animal models have led to clinical trials of siRNAs targeting the VEGF pathway in AMD. In the nervous system, RNAi has been particularly useful for validating disease targets in vivo. Again, several formulations, including saline, polymer complexation and lipid or liposomal formulations, have been efficacious for delivering siRNAs locally to the nervous system in numerous disease models. The simplest mode of delivery is intracerebroventricular, intrathecal or intraparenchymal infusion of naked siRNA formulated in buffered isotonic saline, which results in silencing of specific neuronal molecular mRNA targets in multiple regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems [47] [48] [49] [50] . With naked siRNA formulated in buffered isotonic saline, doses of 0.4 mg per day are typically required for effective target gene silencing. Polymer complexation and lipid or liposomal formulations such as polyethylene imine (PEI), iFECT, DOTAP and JetSI/DOPE facilitate cellular uptake and reduce the doses of siRNA required for effective neuronal target silencing in vivo to approximately 5-40 \u00b5g [51] [52] [53] [54] .",

In rodent studies, the silencing produced by a single dose of SNALP-formulated siRNA at 2.5 mg kg -1 was greater than that reported in the earlier study using cholesterol-conjugated siRNAs. More importantly, therapeutic silencing of apoB was also demonstrated in nonhuman primates. A single dose of 2.5 mg kg -1 siRNA encapsulated in the SNALP formulation reduced apoB mRNA in the livers of cynomolgus monkeys by more than 90%. As in the mouse experiments, apoB silencing was accompanied by substantial reductions in serum cholesterol (>65%) and low-density lipoproteins (>85%). Furthermore, silencing was shown to last for at least 11 d after a single dose. In addition, the treatment seemed to be well tolerated, with transient increases in liver enzymes as the only reported evidence of toxicity. This primate study represented an important step forward in the development of systemic RNAi for therapeutic applications. Moreover, the general applicability of SNALP formulations for hepatic delivery of siRNA has been demonstrated in animal models of HBV and Ebola virus infection 74, 75 .",

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGF-R2)-targeting siRNAs complexed with self-assembling nanoparticles consisting of polyethylene glycol-conjugated (PEGylated) PEI with an Arg-Gly-Asp peptide attached at the distal end of the PEG accumulate in tumors and cause inhibition of VEGF-R2 expression. Intravenous administration of these complexes into tumor-bearing mice inhibits both tumor angiogenesis and growth rate 78 . Simpler PEI formulations have also shown efficacy in xenograft tumor models 79 , as have complexes of siRNA duplexes with atelocollagen. Systemic administration of atelocollagen-siRNA complexes has marked effects on subcutaneous tumor xenografts 66 as well as bone metastases 76 . Another recently described delivery strategy made use of a recombinant antibody fusion protein to achieve cell type-specific delivery. As described above, Song et al. fused the nucleic acid binding protein protamine to the C terminus of a fragment antibody (Fab) targeting the HIV-1 envelope protein gp160. After systemic administration, the Fab-protamine fusion was able to deliver an siRNA mixture to mouse melanoma cells engineered to express the envelope protein, leading to substantial inhibition of tumor growth in mice. Tumors derived from cells not expressing the envelope protein were unaffected. In another example of ligand-directed delivery, Hu-Lieskovan et al. made use of transferrin-conjugated nanoparticles to deliver an siRNA targeting the oncogenic EWS-FLI translocation-derived mRNA in a mouse model of metastatic Ewing sarcoma 80 . Removal of the targeting ligand or the use of a control siRNA sequence eliminated the antitumor effects.",

With AAV delivery of shRNAs, excessive diversion of the endogenous RNAi mechanism occurred that resulted in pronounced toxicity in mice. Clearly, for all drugs, it is critical to be able to control the level of drug and the duration of drug action, such that the exposure is safe while still being efficacious. In distinct contrast to nonviral delivery of siRNAs, a substantial liability of viral delivery is that it is impossible to fully predict drug exposure, with regard to both amount and timing. In addition, as shRNAs enter the RNAi pathway upstream of therapeutic applications for siRNAs, viral vectors expressing high levels of shRNAs may interfere with endogenous miRNA biogenesis.",

At one extreme, with certain tissues, efficacy has so far been demonstrated only with local delivery; current formulations may not provide sufficient drug concentration in the target tissue after systemic delivery. However, with other tissues (for example, liver), intravenous doses in the low mg kg -1 range with liposomal formulation provide robust therapeutic gene silencing. In general, and as with any pharmacologic approach, the doses of siRNA required for efficacy are substantially lower when siRNAs are injected into or near the target tissue than when they are administered systemically. Given the high specificity of siRNAs for their intended molecular target, exposure of nontargeted tissues to drug is an issue only if the molecular target is expressed in nontargeted tissue and has an important role in normal cellular function within that tissue. In these cases, local delivery with more focused exposure might circumvent undesired side effects resulting from systemic delivery.",

With these delivery partners, more robust efficacy can be achieved with doses of siRNA that are substantially lower, less frequent or both. For the additional (non-siRNA) components, however, there are associated biological and large-scale manufacturing considerations. Lipids and polymers can have cytotoxic effects that might limit their use in siRNA delivery for particular disease indications and dosing paradigms. However, it seems to be possible to identify lipid-based formulations and dosing regimens for which cytotoxicity is minimal and the risk of histopathology is reduced [51] [52] [53] . Small molecules, proteins and antibodies used as conjugates also need to be considered from the standpoint of biological activity. If the endogenous molecule (for example, receptor) with which they interact has an important role in normal physiology, then using this endogenous molecule to potentiate delivery may alter its normal function and produce undesired side effects. In all of these cases, the additional non-siRNA molecule or molecules increase the complexity of manufacturing, particularly at large scale. With scientific and technical advances, these approaches may provide marked enhancements to siRNA delivery with acceptable biological and manufacturing considerations.",

In both these cases, highly validated disease targets are being inhibited with siRNAs. Furthermore, direct administration of siRNAs to the eye and lung for AMD and RSV infection, respectively, maximizes the chances of delivering sufficient and therapeutically relevant concentrations of drug to the tissue of interest. In a phase 2 trial in patients with serious progressive AMD, the siRNA Cand5, targeting VEGF, has been reported to provide doserelated benefits with respect to several endpoints, including near vision and lesion size (http://www.acuitypharma.com/press/release13.pdf). Cand5 is also being tested for efficacy against diabetic macular edema in a phase 2 trial that began in early 2006 (http://www.acuitypharma. com/press/release10.pdf). The siRNA Sirna-027, targeting VEGF receptor-1, has recently completed phase 1 trials in patients with the wet form of AMD, in whom it was reported to be well tolerated. In addition, it was reported to stabilize or improve visual acuity in a subset of patients (http://www.sirna.com/wt/page/ocular). For RSV infection, two phase 1 trials with the siRNA ALN-RSV01 have been completed in over 100 healthy adult volunteers, in one of the largest human studies with an RNAi therapeutic, and ALN-RSV01 was found to be safe and well tolerated (http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=148005&p=irol-newsArticle2&ID=849576&highlight=). Additional RNAi therapeutic candidates that are expected to advance into the clinic within the coming year include siRNAs targeting pandemic influenza (http://www.alnylam. com/therapeutic-programs/programs.asp) and hepatitis C (Sirna-034; http://www.sirna.com/wt/page/anti_viral).

The principal advantages of RNAi over small-molecule and protein therapeutics are that all targets, including 'non-druggable' targets, can be inhibited with RNAi and that lead compounds can be rapidly identified and optimized. The primary challenge associated with small-molecule drugs is the identification of highly selective and potent compounds-a difficult and time-consuming process that, for some targets, can be unsuccessful. With RNAi, the identification of highly selective and potent sequences is rapid and has been demonstrated with numerous molecular targets across all molecular classes. With protein and antibody drugs, the main technical challenge is production. For proteins, acceptable cellular production levels are often difficult to achieve. For biologics as a therapeutic class, aggregation continues to be a major issue. In contrast, siRNAs are synthetic and easy to produce from a chemistry standpoint. Of course, with RNAi, by definition, only antagonism of the specific molecular target is possible, whereas small molecules, proteins and antibodies provide an opportunity for agonism of a molecular target. Overall, however, RNAi holds great promise as a therapeutic approach providing a major new class of drugs that will fill a significant gap in modern medicine.",

Clearly, the principal challenge that remains in achieving the broadest application of RNAi therapeutics is the hurdle of delivery. That said, tremendous progress has been made with new conjugation, complexation and lipid-based approaches, although the challenge of siRNA delivery has yet to be solved for all cell types in all organs. Once that challenge is met, the development of RNAi therapeutics will be limited primarily by target validation. It will then be possible to rapidly advance RNAi therapeutics against potentially any disease target in clinical studies and to thereby treat disease in a new manner. In the near future, the ongoing clinical trials with siRNAs for macular degeneration and RSV may reveal the exciting potential of RNAi therapeutics as the next major class of drug molecules.",
