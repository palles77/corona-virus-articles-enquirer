This study determined associations between respiratory viruses and subsequent 34 illness course in primary care adult patients presenting with acute cough and/or suspected lower 35 respiratory tract infection (LRTI). 36 37 METHODS. A prospective European primary care study recruited adults with symptoms of lower 38 respiratory tract infection between Nov-Apr 2007-2010. Real-time in-house polymerase chain 39 reaction (PCR) was performed to test for six common respiratory viruses. In this secondary 40 analysis, symptom severity (scored 1=no problem, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=severe) and symptom 41 duration were compared between groups with different viral aetiologies using regression and Cox 42 proportional hazard models, respectively. Additionally, associations between baseline viral load 43 (cycle threshold (Ct) value) and illness course were assessed. 44 45 RESULTS. The PCR tested positive for a common respiratory virus in 1,354 of the 2,957 (45.8%) 46 included patients. The overall mean symptom score at presentation was 2.09 (95%CI 2.07-2.11) 47 and the median duration until resolution of moderately bad or severe symptoms was 8.70 days 48 (interquartile range 4.50-11.00). Patients with influenza virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), 49 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus (CoV) or rhinovirus had a significantly higher 50 symptom score than patients with no virus isolated (0.07-0.25 points or 2.3-8.3% higher symptom 51 score). Time to symptom resolution was longer in RSV infections (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 52 0.80, 95%CI 0.65-0.96) and hMPV infections (AHR 0.77, 95%CI 0.62-0.94) than in infections with 53 no virus isolated. Overall, baseline viral load was associated with symptom severity (difference 54 0.11, 95%CI 0.06-0.16 per 10 cycles decrease in Ct value), but not with symptom duration.",

In adults, influenza virus, bacteria, and 68 viral-bacterial coinfections are assumed to cause the most severe illnesses, with most systemic 69 symptoms, longest illness durations, and most complications(5-7). However, evidence on 70 associations between aetiology and severity are mainly derived from hospital care settings with 71 vulnerable patient populations (8) (9) (10) . In this setting, a focus on pathogens with the highest 72 complication rates is obvious. Quite often, however, this focus is also applied in the general 73 community, with public health interventions as the annual influenza vaccinations targeted at the 74 most vulnerable people with the aim of reducing the risk of complications and death(11). Although 75 data on the impact of respiratory viruses in the primary care setting are limited due to restricted 76 microbial testing and absence of a standardized, validated outcome measure to evaluate illness 77 severity(12), there are studies suggesting that the burden of disease from infections due to 78 respiratory viruses other than influenza -i.p. rhinovirus, coronavirus and RSV -may be greater 79 overall(13). In this study, we aimed to explore the associations between respiratory viral 80 pathogens, including viral load, and illness course in the adult primary care community, thereby 81 opening up possibilities to base the public health focus on the impact of respiratory viruses in 82 primary care, rather than on extrapolated data from hospital settings.

We also assessed the duration until resolution of 203 moderately bad or severe symptoms for the six individual viruses as compared to patients without 204 a detected virus (Figure 4). Patients with RSV had an adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) of 0.80 (95%CI 205 0.65-0.96) and patients with hMPV an AHR of 0.77 (95%CI 0.62-0.94) for symptom resolution,206indicating a significant longer symptom duration as compared to patients without RSV and hMPV, 207 respectively. All other viral pathogens showed no significant differences in AHRs. Among patients in 208 whom a virus was detected, there was no association between baseline viral load and duration of 209 moderately bad or severe symptoms (AHR per unit lower Ct value 1.01, 95%CI 0.99-1.02).

Additionally, RSV and hMPV were associated with a longer duration of 220 moderately bad or severe symptoms, which might be linked to the pattern of immune response to 221 these viruses(21). For all respiratory virus together, a higher viral load measured at presentation, 222 was significantly associated with a higher symptom severity. This was caused by significant 223 associations between viral load and symptom severity for rhinovirus and RSV. There was no 224 association between viral load and the duration of moderately bad or severe symptoms. study does not provide direct clinically actionable insight. However, although we do not228 provide recommendations on clinical management or treatment, we do think that the large number 229 of patients included in this study provides important information which can be used to prioritize 230 different respiratory viruses in the primary care setting. Currently, public health resources in the 231 general community are guided by the aim to prevent complications in the most vulnerable people, 232 and are focused almost exclusively on influenza(11,22,23). From a socio-economic perspective, 233 however, targeting public health resources only at influenza virus neglects the substantial illness 234 course in the community caused by other respiratory viruses. From our results we conclude that Despite the fact that we had a large cohort in which data were collected in a standardized manner, 241 and outcome measures were in line with previous studies(14,17-19), there are several potential selection might be present is uncertain since we have no information on the number and 245 characteristics of patients who declined participation. Secondly, the use of medication, such as 246 antibiotic treatment, antiviral treatment, (over-the-counter) symptomatic treatment, and prophylactic 247 antibiotics with antiviral effects (as azithromycin) might have influenced outcomes . We consider it 248 unlikely that receiving antibiotics caused biased results, since the in-study amoxicillin trial showed 249 no differences in outcomes between the intervention and placebo group(14). Since only two 250 patients in our cohort were prescribed antivirals (oseltamivir), we consider the effect of antiviral 251 treatment also negligible. Unavailability of data on the use of prophylactic antibiotics and 252 symptomatic medication made adjustment for these factors impossible. Thirdly, there might be bias 253 in the self-report of symptoms by patients. However, previous studies showed a high internal 254 reliability, validity and sensitivity of the symptom diary we used(15). Also, since the 95/207 (46%) 255 patients who did not meet the event criteria and who did not fill out their symptom diary completely 256 were censored for the analysis, we do not expect selection bias due to loss of follow-up. Fourthly, 257 the required sample size for the prospective observational cohort was not determined on the 258 specific requirements of the current study. Hence, inconclusive or non-significant results can 259 therefore not be considered definite to prove the absence of associations. We specifically choose 260 not to correct for multiple testing, as this correction may further hamper statistical power, especially 261 for viruses only detected in a limited number of patients. Fifthly, the relatively low overall 262 percentage of detected viruses might have been caused by the inclusion of patients with quite long 263 duration of symptoms. Since respiratory fluids are renewed quickly in the patient, viral pathogens in 264 patients with longer duration of symptoms might therefore not have been detectable anymore.",
