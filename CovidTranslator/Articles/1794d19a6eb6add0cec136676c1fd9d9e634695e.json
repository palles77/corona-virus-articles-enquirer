Closure of live poultry markets in some affected cities dramatically reduced numbers of cases during summer of 2013 [4] , but the epidemic resurged during the winter 2013-14, increasing reported cases to 393 in Mainland China as of 30 March 2014 [5] . The winter 2013-14 outbreak was mainly focused in Zhejiang Province in eastern China near Shanghai and Guangdong province in southern China adjacent to Hong Kong [6] . Guangdong's proximity sees considerable daily crossborder movement of people and poultry into Hong Kong. Ten confirmed human cases of H7N9 infection have been reported in Hong Kong since the winter 2013-2014 outbreak, each of which had a recent history of exposure to live poultry in Guangdong [7] .",

            "text": "Although a local epidemic has yet to occur in Hong Kong, the behavioral responses among the public in the early stages of an infectious disease epidemic are important for determining the patterns of population contacts. Population behavior can significantly modify the basic reproductive number, R 0 , and thereby the daily number of newly emerging cases, influencing the epidemic's trajectory and final size [8] [9] [10] . A few studies have tried to measure the patterns of social contacts to provide some empirical parameters for mathematical models to assess the dynamics of transmission during epidemics [9, 10] . These studies mainly focused on patterns of daily individual contacts, and they treated behavior in the population as homogenous, without considering the potential heterogeneity in population behavior in response to infectious disease outbreaks [9, 10] . Latent class analysis (LCA), a statistical approach that captures population heterogeneity and classifies the observed population into a certain number of groups who answer a set of categorical variables in similar ways [11] , has been widely used to analyze patterns of behaviors in relation to non-communicable diseases such as alcohol drinking [12, 13] . However, we are not aware of previous studies that attempted to classify population behavioral patterns in response to a new infectious disease. To address this knowledge gap, the first objective of this study was to explore population behavior patterns in response to newly emerging infection diseases, using H7N9 infection as an example. We also examined whether patterns of behavioral responses would change as the H7N9 epidemic grew in Mainland China and more imported H7N9 human cases were reported in Hong Kong.",

Population behaviors toward a threat are inherently heterogeneous because of individual variation in perceived personal risk to any given threat which serves to motivate responses to the threat [14] . Prevailing cognitive behavioral models [15, 16] propose that higher perceived personal susceptibility to disease and higher perceived threat severity motivates greater adoption of protective behaviors. A recent literature review [14] showed that most empirical studies have consistently reported a positive association between perceived personal risk (including perceived personal susceptibility to and perceived severity of the disease, and worry about the infection) and adoption of both hygiene practices and avoidance behaviors during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic.",

Older people are more likely to view themselves as more susceptible to a disease [17] , and thereby they were more likely to adopt hygiene practices [18] [19] [20] and avoid public places during epidemics [21, 22] . Reports suggest that females perceive themselves to be more vulnerable to a threat and to worry more about diseases [23] . Women report better hygiene and more avoidance behaviors during epidemics [18, 19, 24] . The association between educational attainment and adoption of protective behaviors is less conclusive in the literature [14] . Better educated individuals may be more aware of the risk related to the threat but may also have more confidence to control the threat [25] , and so might be expected to be more variable in their responses to a new infectious disease. Therefore, the second objective of this study involved examining how patterns of behavioral responses among the public differed by their demographics and risk perception relating to H7N9 infection.",

To recruit subjects, households were first selected using random-digit dialed telephone numbers.

This has been demonstrated to be a valid method to recruit a sample representative of the population in Hong Kong in previous studies [19, 28] . All calls were made by an experienced polling institution that had demonstrated good performance in similar population surveys [28] . All interviews were conducted during non-working hours to avoid oversampling of unemployed subjects. Up to four additional calls were made for unanswered numbers or if the selected subjects were not available. All respondents gave verbal consent before participating in the study.

The simulation study suggested that BIC index was more accurate in determining the true number of classes in LCA based on large sample size (N=1000) compared with AIC and aBIC [32] . Entropy has a value range from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating better quality of classification of the model [31] . Except for the model fit statistics, the principle of parsimony and model interpretability are another two critical criteria for determining the optimal number of latent classes [33] . Parsimony means that when other conditions are equal, model selection should favor the model with fewer freely estimated parameters. That is, the model with fewer latent classes should be selected. For multigroup models, model selection should also privilege models in which all groups have the same number of latent classes if the data can be easily interpreted based on the same model [33] . Using the above criteria, the optimal number of latent class was determined for each sample. LCA estimates both the item-response probabilities for each latent class and the class probabilities (latent class prevalence) within each sample.",

To do this, we compare the unconstrained model (M1) in which all item-response probabilities and class probabilities across the three samples were set free and a nested model (M2) in which item-response probabilities were set equal across samples but class probabilities were allowed to vary across samples. Then M1 and M2 will be compared for their likelihood ratio chi-square (G 2 ) and values of AIC and BIC.

Furthermore, the lower values of AIC and BIC for M2 indicated that the more parsimonious M2 should be selected. Taking into account the comparable item-response probabilities within each latent class across samples (Fig. 1) , we determined that item-response probabilities across samples could be equally constrained. Comparing M3 (the complete constrained model) with M2, the \u0394G 2 indicated that M3 did not fit as well as M2.

Across the three samples, we identified three comparable major patterns (classes) in preventive behavior: the moderate hygiene compliance, Good hygiene compliance, and Vigilance. This suggests that, currently within the context of repeated epidemic influenza irruptions from South China, the Hong Kong population may retain relative stable patterns of behavioral responses to a new infectious disease in the early Table 1 for interpretation of positive responses stages, even as more confirmed cases of human infection were reported and the epidemic progressed [6] . The generally consistent item-response probabilities of a particular latent class across the three surveys further suggest structural invariance in behavior patterns [33] though it is possible that members of particular classes also change certain behaviors. For example, the Moderate hygiene compliance group reduced hand-washing after coughing or sneezing as the epidemic progressed but might have demonstrated an increase if the epidemic had significantly intensified. Moderate hygiene compliance defined the most prevalent group and its prevalence was comparable across the three surveys. Members in the Moderate hygiene compliance class may be quite resistant to changing their existing pattern of practices even if a potential epidemic is indicated but might change if significant increases in threat level are indicated. However, there were significant changes in prevalence of Class 2 (Good hygiene compliance) and Class 3 (Vigilance) in the third survey (Feb-2014 survey), suggesting that as the H7N9 epidemic became more severe in Mainland China and more imported H7N9 human cases were reported in Hong Kong; members of Class 2 may become more vigilant to the threat and thereby increase adoption of avoidance behaviors subsequently. However, this speculation awaits confirmation in future cohort surveys.",

Since it is unlikely that people will reduce their prevention practices in response to a growing epidemic threat, this pattern of practices is very likely to be habitual or even increased over the usual level seen in the absence of any epidemic activity. This class may contribute to transmitting infections such as seasonal influenza in their daily life or they might be late-stage responders who intensify protective behaviors only when risk is perceived to be imminent. Compared with the characteristics of the other two classes, respondents in this class were more likely to be male, younger, and less educated. This is consistent with previous studies conducted during SARS and the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic in Hong Kong [18, 19, 28] , suggesting that these subpopulations should be considered for targeted public health interventions to control future outbreaks of infectious diseases.",

The error bars represent the 95 % confidence for each class probability estimated using multinomial logistic regression models class also. The occasional avoidance behavior characterizing the behavior pattern of members in Good hygiene compliance suggests that they may have greater propensity toward modifying behavior should threat increase, through adopting greater avoidance and intensification of prevention. Previous mathematical models concluded that early behavioral change in response to an epidemic is small and should have little impact on the development of the epidemic [36] . However, the present study suggests that even in the early preepidemic stage, when there is little evidence for human-tohuman transmission of H7N9 and no locally acquired cases, around 13-20 % of the respondents had reported high compliance to most hygiene practices and avoidance behaviors, indicating high vigilance to the threat. Except for high compliance to hygiene practices, this group also adopted more avoidance behaviors that were recommended by the government of Hong Kong, suggesting that this group had high compliance to government recommendation in the prevention of H7N9. The odds of an individual being assigned to this group were positively associated with greater perceived threat from H7N9 relative to members in the other two classes. Female, older, married, and better educated individuals were more likely to belong to Class 3 compared to the other two classes. This was also consistent with previous studies conducted during SARS [14, 19] .",

            "text": "Previous studies have indicated that humans are inherently heterogeneous in their attention to threat, which is closely linked to personality characteristics such as neuroticism and trait anxiety [34, 35, 37] . For example, people who are generally more anxious would be expected to show high vigilance for potential threat information [34, 35] . Variation in these personality characteristics generates variable attentional bias in information processing and, coupled with cognitive style manifests as enhanced, or blunted vigilance toward threat-related information [38, 39] . This might help to explain the spectrum of active and passive behaviors seen when different individuals face a common threat signal. However, we did not measure neuroticism or trait anxiety among the respondents and thereby cannot conclude whether the heterogeneity in behavioral responses to this new infectious diseases was due to variation in these personality characteristics or not. However, the significant difference in perceived threat of H7N9 among the three classes suggests that variation in perceived vulnerability at least partially explained the behavioral heterogeneity across classes. Such variability has long been described with younger males particularly poor at risk estimates and overconfident in their abilities to control risk impacts [23, 40] , so this may reflect a developmental state. This study had some limitations. First, although the three independent cross-sectional surveys enable observing the change in profiles and prevalence of each behavior pattern, the actual growth and decay of preventive behaviors in these three classes within the evolution of an epidemic remain unknown. Longitudinal studies should be conducted throughout future epidemics to more precisely investigate these research questions. Second, sampling errors may be a reason for the variation in prevalence of behavior patterns across surveys. However, the three cross-sectional surveys were conducted using the same sampling methods, and the demographics of the three samples were generally comparable. We had further adjusted the difference in the prevalence of behavioral patterns by sampling age, gender, and education to minimize the influence of sampling errors on behavioral variation across samples. Third, our measure of perceived personal susceptibility to H7N9 was not conditional on Bnot taking any prevention.^This may lead to underestimation of the true association between perceived personal susceptibility and adoption of prevention if some respondents estimated their personal susceptibility to be low because they had taken the preventive behaviors [41] . Furthermore, although LCA provides significant insights in guiding public health practices, how to determine the optimal number of classes using LCA can be as much an art as a science [31] . Here, we determined the final number of latent classes based on BIC, entropy value, the principle of parsimony, and the model interpretation, factors which have been suggested to be more important over other model fit indices in simulation studies [31] [32] [33] . Finally, since all behaviors were measured relying on self-reported data, the results may be subject to social desirability bias. As a result, the actual size of the second and the third classes may be overestimated.",

These three classes reflect different levels of adoption of protection which may translate to different levels of vulnerability toward contracting and spreading H7N9 infection or instead may be a reflection of generalized compliance behavior. It appears that as epidemic threat increases, more people in Good hygiene compliance may transfer to the Vigilance group while that of Moderate hygiene compliance may remain unchanged. However, it remains unknown how the trajectories of change in these behavioral practices will unfold as the threat level evolves throughout an epidemic. Given the present limited data, young, mostly single males and those with lower educational achievement represent a group for whom public health messages need to be targeted. ",
