            "text": "Polyomavirus BK is a recognized cause of nephropathy and hemorrhagic cystitis in kidney or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. This study explored a role of genetic variations in capsid protein VP-1 gene as a factor in viral pathogenesis. VP-1 was amplified from 7 healthy subjects with viruria, 7 transplant patients with viruria, and 11 patients with viremia or nephropathy. PCR products were cloned and a total of 558 clonal sequences were subjected to phylogenetic analysis using standard methods. VP-1 quasispecies were found in 25/25 and coinfection with different genotypes in 12/ 25 subjects. Genotype II was found as an unexpected minority species in 5/25 individuals. Recombinant strains of uncertain biologic significance, which frequently contained genotype II and IV sequences were identified in 9/25 subjects. Viremia/nephropathy group was characterized by (a) greater sequence complexity in whole VP-1 versus BC loop and BC loop compared to the HI loop, (b) greater intra-strain genetic diversity in the BC loop compared to whole VP-1 protein and HI loop, (c) more non-synonymous substitutions (dN) in the BC loop compared to whole VP-1 and HI loop, (e) fewer synonymous substitutions (dS) compared to healthy-viruria group, and (f) selection pressure (dN/dS >1.0) exerted on VP-1. In conclusion, this study documents frequent occurrence of quasispecies in a host DNA polymerase dependent virus which is theoretically expected to show high replication fidelity. Quasispecies occur even in healthy subjects with viruria, but evolutionary selection pressure directed at the viral capsid protein VP-1 is seen only in patients with viremia.",

This is followed by latency within the urogenital tract [Chesters et al., 1983; Knowles, 2001] . Reactivation of infection occurs under conditions of immunosuppression, particularly renal transplantation. The initial manifestation is asymptomatic viruria. This is followed by viremia, and overt nephropathy, which may culminate in graft loss [Brennan et al., 2005; Brinkert et al., 2010; Hirsch and Randhawa, 2009; Low et al., 2004; O'Donnell et al., 2009; Randhawa and Demetris, 2000; Thomas et al., 2009] . BKV has also been associated with hemorrhagic cystitis in bone marrow and hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients and cancer patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Whereas viruria is generally considered to be insignificant, viremia and nephropathy trigger reduction in immunosuppression and anti-viral therapy.",

            "text": "The reason why only 1-10% of patients develop symptomatic disease is not clearly understood. The intensity of immunosuppression is one recognized variable. There is also evidence that viral genetic factors are important [Carr et al., 2006; Dugan et al., 2007; Gosert et al., 2008; Hirsch et al., 2003; Randhawa et al., 2002] . Genetic mutations and rearrangement are most extensively described in the non-coding control region of BKV [Sharma et al., 2007] . There are relatively few studies that have focused on the coding regions of the viral genome. The viral capsid protein 1 (VP-1) of BKV is responsible for virus assembly and maintaining the viral structural integrity. It is also essential as a receptor site for the infection of host cells. In mouse polyomavirus, small plaque and large plaque forming viral strains differ at a single amino acid located at position 92 of VP-1 [Freund et al., 1991] . There are also reports of increased mutations of the VP-1 gene in patients with BK nephropathy [Boldorini et al., 2009; Bolen et al., 1981; Jin and Gibson, 1996; Randhawa et al., 2002] . Thus, genetic alterations in VP-1 may be important with regards to (a) modulation of tissue injury, (b) evasion of host neutralizing antibodies, and (c) escape from VP-1 specific T-cell responses [Binggeli et al., 2007] . Accordingly, this study has characterized BKV sequence diversity and strain complexity in samples obtained from a broad spectrum of patients. The data highlights the frequent occurrence of mixed infections and presence of quasispecies in both immunosuppressed and healthy individuals. These observations have implications for design of diagnostic assays, effective vaccines and antimicrobial agents against BKV.",

The thermal cycling program consisted of the following steps: 95 \u00b0C 4 min; 95 \u00b0C 15 sec, 58 \u00b0C 40 sec, and 72 \u00b0C 90 sec. After 40 cycles of amplification the PCR product was incubated at 72 \u00b0C for 15 min. Eight PCR reactions were pooled for each sample to generate enough DNA for cloning. In 5 samples where the initial amplification generated no visible product under agarose gel electrophoresis, the PCR reaction was diluted 10 times and amplified further for 30 cycles using a pair of nested PCR primers: Forward BKVP-1_FN 5\u2032 and Reverse BKVP-1RN described in the section on sequencing. The reaction volume for the nested PCR was 100 \u03bcl. The sensitivity of this is 1000 copies/ml in plasma and 200 copies/ml in urine.",

BC, DE & HI loops were localized using published literature [Liddington et al., 1991; Murata et al., 2008] . Nucleotide diversity for sequence sets containing the predominant clones from each of the three subject categories was measured. This was done by computing the overall mean distance between all possible comparisons of two sequences in the sequence set of interest. These measurements reflect the mean number of nucleotide differences per site. Calculations are based on the nucleotide substitution model with a Jukes Cantor correction for multiple substitutions (Mega 4.1). The parameters dS and dN were respectively obtained by performing distance calculations on all potential synonymous site (dS) and nonsynonymous (dN) sites using the Nei-Gojobori method with Jukes and Cantor correction. A dN/dS ratio >1.0 was considered to be indicative of positive selection, while a ratio of <1.0 indicated purifying selection. Nucleotide and amino acid complexity were assessed for all clonal sequences in any given sample by first calculating Shannon entropy using the formula S = \u2212\u03a3 i (p i lnp i ), where p i is the frequency of each sequence in the viral quasispecies. Then, the normalized entropy, S n , was calculated using the formula S n = S/lnN, where N is the total number of sequences analyzed [Minosse et al., 2006 ]. This quantity can vary from 0 (no diversity) to 1.0 (maximum diversity).",

Genotype I is the most prevalent in all major geographic areas with a prevalence range of 46-82% [Luo et al., 2008] . Subgroups have been described within genotype 1. These appear to have predilection for specific geographic regions, such as subgroup 1a for Africa, 1b-1 for Southeast Asia, 1b-2 for Europe, and 1c for northeast Asia . Genotype IV is typically the second most prevalent type (incidence 12-54%). There are also differences in geographic distribution for its constituent subgroups [Baksh et al., 2001; Di Taranto et al., 1997; Jin, 1993] Thus, genotype IVa1 comprised 8/15 (53%) of genotype IV strains obtained from southeast Asia (Philippines, Vietnam, and Mynamar), while genotype IVb1 and IVb2 accounted for 40% and 55% respectively of Korean and Japanese isolates. In contrast, 21/26 (81%) of Chinese strains were genotype IVc1, and all 22 genotype IV strains from Europe were subgroup IVc2 . Based on serology studies, Genotypes II and III have been considered to be uncommon strains [Stolt et al., 2003 ]. However, clonal sequence data from this study suggests that genotype II is present as a minority species much more commonly than hitherto recognized. More convincing proof of this will require development of genotype II specific serologic assays.",

The presence of BKV DNA in metropolitan sewage suggests that feco-oral transmission may be yet another mode of viral transmission from one individual to another.

            "text": "Samples showing infection with a single genotype also showed multiple genetically related populations. The high fidelity of DNA polymerase under the conditions used indicates that these reflect BKV quasispecies rather than a laboratory artifact. Quasispecies are most widely recognized in RNA viruses, which have error prone mechanisms for replication of nucleic acids. In contrast, DNA viruses use the host replication system with high fidelity, good proof reading capacity, and efficient post replication repair capacity. Hence, the mutation rate of DNA viruses may be up to 100 times lower than RNA viruses [Drake and Holland, 1999] . BKV also uses host DNA polymerase for its replication, but agnoprotein coded by the viral genome inhibits double-stranded DNA break repair activity. This could potentially increase the error rate in BKV DNA replication [Darbinyan et al., 2004] . It is pertinent to mention that quasispecies have been described in another DNA virus, namely, canine parvovirus [Shackelton et al., 2005] . The work reported here documents that VP-1 quasispecies are common in the context of human BKV infection. This likely reflects the documented high turnover rate of this virus in the renal tubular epithelium: in kidney transplant patients, it has been estimated that between 1E+07 to 1E+09 virions can be produced and cleared per patient per day [Funk et al., 2006] . In healthy subjects BKV is typically latent, but approximately 5% do excrete virus asymptomatically, and the viral turnover in this small subset of healthy subjects with viruria appears to be sufficient to result in formation of quasispecies.",

The BC loop region was also characterized by a high dN/dS ratio indicating that this part of the viral genome was under positive selection pressure in viremia/nephropathy subjects. Given the function of the BC loop in virus-host cell receptor interactions, this selection is likely driven by enhanced cellular entry of the virus into the cell. Less likely possibilities include replicative fitness, immune escape or better adaptability to the metabolic milieu of the cell. BC loop mutations are known to enhance the plaque forming ability of mouse polyomavirus [Bauer et al., 1995; Freund et al., 1991] . Recently, loop specific polymorphisms in polyomavirus JC virus have been associated with favorable prognosis in patients with progressive multifocal encephalopathy [Delbue et al., 2009] . Some of the adaptive mutations in these patients have been shown to be under selection pressure at the codon level [Sunyaev et al., 2009] . In contrast with the experience reported here, a prior study evaluating genetic distances between 176 publicly available polyomavirus sequences found no evidence of positive (diversifying) selection either at the whole genome or individual gene level [Mes et al., 2010] . Analysis of nucleotide substitutions at synonymous and non-synonymous sites suggested that BKV genes evolve under strong constraints that result in a net purifying selection at the population level. The present study differs from the aforementioned one in having analyzed intra-host (as opposed to between-host) nucleotide substitutions in the setting of post-kidney transplant viremia or nephropathy. The BKV genome has also been reported to be stable in molecular clones of BKV derived from six post-transplant patients with viruria and serum creatinine ranging from 1.1 to 1.7 mg/dl . Plasma BKV status was not evaluated in the latter study. In a rare case of BKV associated capillary leak syndrome clones of infectious virus derived from the urine, muscle, and heart showed high intra-strain genetic diversity, but no positive selection as judged by the dN/dS ratio [Chen et al., 2004] .",

[Brown, 1997; Gibbs et al., 2001; Gibbs and Weiller, 1999; Malim and Emerman, 2001; Rest and Mindell, 2003] . Sequence rearrangements in the noncoding control region of BKV are well documented [Carr et al., 2006; Perets et al., 2009; Sharma et al., 2007 ]. An earlier study from this laboratory described two BKV strains with potential recombinations in the VP-1 gene [Luo et al., 2009 ]. In the current work, recombinants constitute approximately 5% of all clonal sequences examined. While recombinant sequences can be created as an in-vitro artifact, the frequent finding of genotype II footprints, presence of sequences not represented in the majority genotype, the non-random distribution of breakpoints, and the occurrence of multiple breakpoints, some of which were common to strains derived from different subjects, makes it unlikely that all of the observed recombinants are in-vitro artifacts. One could argue that horizontal exchange of genetic material is to be expected in individuals co-infected with multiple BK virus strains. Other investigators have accrued evidence that even BKV coding regions other than VP-1 can participate in genetic recombination events. Thus, it has been proposed that a region of the BKV genome upstream of the VP3 gene is derived from a recombination event with SV40 in the course of evolution [Yasunaga and Miyata, 1982] . Yogo et al identified a Non coding control region (NCCR)-Large T antigen recombinant JC virus in brain tissue derived from a patient with progressive multifocal encephalopathy. The NCCR in this viral strain had a small deletion as well as a 29 bp sequence originating from the early region of the JCV genome [Yogo et al., 1994] . Genetic recombination has been reported in culture systems when wild type BKV is introduced in permissive BSC-1 cells along with either early or late defective SV40 genome regions [O'Neill and Miller, 1985] . In experimentally constructed hybrid sequences, coding portions of BKV and polyomavirus SV40 genome can function if placed downstream of the regulatory region of polyomavirus JC [Chuke et al., 1986] . Notwithstanding these considerations, the clinical significance of the VP-1 recombinant BKV species observed by us is uncertain: these always represented a minor viral population in the samples studied.",

            "text": "In conclusion, this study has used clonal sequencing of BKV VP-1 to document frequent occurrence of mixed infections and recombinant strains. Genotype II was found as an unexpected minority in 25% of individuals and contributed to 55% of the recombinant sequences. VP-1 Quasispecies were found in the urine of both immunosuppressed and healthy individuals. Evidence of evolutionary selection pressure on quasispecies was demonstrable only in patients with viremia or nephropathy. In healthy subjects, generation of quasispecies may reflect an evolving attempt to achieve immune evasion. The viral fitness of the quasispecies was not assessed in this study. However, it has been shown by others changes in VP-1 as well as NCCR sequence can alter rates of viral replication [Gosert et al., 2008; Nukuzuma et al., 2006] . Representative recombinant sequences identified by bootscans implemented in Simplot. Scans were generated using a sliding window of 140 nucleotides, moving 10 nucleotides at a time. The x-axis shows nucleotide positions on the VP-1 gene sequence (Dun numbering). The y-axis depicts the percent agreement in the permuted trees. The query sequences are indicated in the title line starting with patient number followed by clone number. Thus, 20CL7 refers to clone #7 from patient #20. Accession numbers of published sequences used in this plot are: Dunlop (V01108), TW-3 (AB211391), and ETH-3 (AB263916). Figure 1A illustrates a recombinant sequence that conforms to type I in the initial segment (blue line) and type IV in the final segment (red line). A type II outgroup sequence (II_ETH, green line) was used to generate the plot. Figure 1B depicts a more complex recombinant sequence with an initial segment conforming to genotype IV (blue line), which is followed by a short genotype II sequence (red line), following which the sequence reverts to genotype IV (blue line). BKV strain Dun (Type I) was used as the outgroup sequence (green line). Table 1 Virologic Parameters of Subjects Studied * II/1   II-IV/3, IV-II/3, I-IV/1, I-II-I/1, I-II/  1, I-II-IV/1 * The number of clones corresponding to each dominant, co-infecting or recobminant genotype is indicated after the slash, wherever this number is not identical to the total number of clones sequenced. Parent sequences contributing to recombination are separated by a dash and are listed in the order in which they are recombined. The number after the slash indicates the number of recombinants found (totals 29).",
