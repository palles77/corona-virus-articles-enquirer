Since then, aerobiology has been defined by many as the study of the aerosolization, aerial transmission and deposition of biological materials. Others have defined it more specifically as the study of diseases that may be transmitted via the respiratory route (Dimmic and Akers, 1969) . Despite the variations in definition, this evolving area is becoming increasingly important in many aspects of diverse fields including public health, environmental science, industrial and agricultural engineering, biological warfare and space exploration.",

            "text": "Particles suspended in air are called aerosols. These pose a threat to human health mainly through respiratory intake and deposition in nasal and bronchial airways. In addition, soil or dust particles can act as a \"raft\" for biological entities known as bioaerosols (Brooks et al., 2004) . Smaller aerosols travel further into the respiratory system and generally cause more health problems than larger particles. For this reason, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has divided airborne particulates into two size categories: PM 10 , which refers to particles with diameters less than or equal to 10 \u00b5m (10,000 nm), and PM 2.5 , which are particles less than or equal to 2.5 \u00b5m (2500 nm) in diameter. For this classification, the diameter of aerosols is defined as the aerodynamic diameter: d pa 5 d ps \u00f0\u03c1 p =\u03c1 w \u00de 1 /2 (Eq. 5.1) where: d pa 5 aerodynamic particle diameter (\u00b5m) d ps 5 Stokes' diameter (\u00b5m) \u03c1 p 5 particle density (g/cm 23 ) \u03c1 w 5 density of water (g/cm 23 ) Atmospheric particulate concentration is expressed in micrograms of particles per cubic meter of air (\u00b5g/m 3 ). The USEPA established a National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for PM 10 of 150 \u00b5g/m 23 averaged over a 24-hour period, and 50 \u00b5g/m 23 averaged annually. More recently, separate standards for PM 2.5 of 65 \u00b5g/m 23 for 24 hours and 15 \u00b5g/m 23 annually have been introduced.",

These virus-associated aerosols are dispersed by a cough or sneeze, transported through the air, inhaled, and deposited in the lungs of a nearby person, where they can initiate a new infection ( Figure 5 .3).

What does this mean? For an instantaneous point source under the influence of a mean wind direction, spread would be a standard spatial deviation from a linear axis (x) extending from the source (origin) in the mean direction of wind flow, with diffusion caused by turbulence occurring in the lateral (y) and vertical (z) axes ( Figure 5 .4). The standard deviation of particulate diffusion cannot be considered constant over a particular spatial orientation, but is instead dependent on the time taken to reach the particular distance. Mathematical models that attempt to estimate the transport of airborne particles use this basic premise as a foundation for predictions. To picture this concept, imagine standing at the door of a room, where someone is holding a smoking candle. If there is no air current in the room the smoke will still eventually reach you at the door, but it will be very diffuse as it is also spreading in every other direction. However, if there is a fan behind the person holding the smoking candle and this fan is pointed at the door, then the smoke from the candle will be carried by this air current. It will travel the same distance as it did before, but it will travel faster, undergo less diffusion and as a result be more concentrated when it reaches you. This is the principle of time-dependent diffusion as indicated by Tayler's theory.",

Thus, surface impaction is a very critical factor influencing transport and deposition, especially for bioaerosols. Impaction potential is the relative likelihood that an airborne object will collide with another object in its path. Impaction does not necessarily result in permanent deposition, however. Once a particle collides with an object, it has the potential to bounce. Bouncing off a surface causes the particle to reenter the air current at a lower rate, which can have one of two effects: (1) it can allow subsequent downward molecular diffusion and gravitational settling to occur, resulting in deposition on another nearby surface; or (2) it can allow the particle to escape the surface and once again reenter the air current.

The same spore (bioaerosol), if it condensed with another particle such as a water droplet, has a greater mass and thus a greater terminal velocity. For instance, if the clostridial spore were to condense with a water droplet that doubled the bioaerosol density from 1.3 to 2.6 g/cm 3 , the terminal velocity would be increased from 0.016 to 0.032 cm/sec. The overall efficiency of rain deposition also depends on the spread area of the particle plume. Larger, more diffuse plumes undergo stronger impaction than smaller, more concentrated plumes.

The heavier the rainfall, the greater the overall rates and numbers of the condensation reactions, and the greater the subsequent increase in rain deposition.",

Wells and Riley (1937) were among the first to show this phenomenon, indicating that as the relative humidity approaches 100%, the death rate of Escherichia coli increases. In general, it has been reported that most Gram-negative bacteria associated with aerosols tend to survive for longer periods at low to mid levels of relative humidities, with enhanced decay at relative humidities above 80% (Brooks et al., 2004) . The opposite tends to be true for Gram-positive bacteria, which tend to remain viable longer in association with high relative humidities (Theunissen et al., 1993) . Thus, the ability of a microorganism to remain viable in a bioaerosol is related to the organism's surface biochemistry. One mechanism that explains loss of viability in association with very low relative humidity is a structural change in the lipid bilayers of the cell membrane. As water is lost from the cell, the cell membrane bilayer changes from the typical crystalline structure to a gel phase. This structural phase transition affects cell surface protein configurations and ultimately results in inactivation of the cell (Hurst et al., 1997) . In general, Gram-negative bacteria react unfavorably to desiccation, whereas Gram-positive cells are more tolerant of desiccation stress (Mohr, 2001) . Early studies by Loosli et al. (1943) showed that the influenza virus was also adversely affected by an increase in relative humidity. More recent work suggests that viruses possessing enveloped nucleocapsids (such as the influenza virus) have longer airborne survival when the relative humidity is below 50%, whereas viruses with naked nucleocapsids (such as the enteric viruses) are more stable at a relative humidity above 50% (Mohr, 2001) . It should be noted that viruses with enveloped nucleocapsids tend to have better survival in aerosols than those without. Some viruses are also stable in the AMB pathway over large ranges of relative humidity, which makes them very successful airborne pathogens.",

The abundance of culturable bacteria and fungi in clouds varies with the season, with greater numbers occurring in the summer and fall. While only 1% of the bacteria and 50% of the fungi in clouds are culturable, studies suggest that the majority are metabolically active (Delort et al., 2010) . Bacterial numbers range from 10 3 to 10 4 /ml compared to fungal numbers of 10 2 to 10 4 /ml. The cloud environment is a harsh environment with UV light irradiation, desiccation, low temperatures and other factors potentially adversely affecting microbes (Figure 5 .8).

            "text": "Major pathogens of such crops are the wheat rust fungi. These spore-forming fungi cause some of the most devastating diseases of wheat and other grains. In 1993, one type of wheat rust (leaf rust) was responsible for the loss of over 40 million bushels of wheat in Kansas and Nebraska alone. Even with selective breeding for resistance in wheat plants, leaf rust continues to have major economic impacts. The high concentration of wheat in areas ranging from northern Texas to Minnesota and up into the Dakotas makes this whole region highly susceptible to rust epidemics. Spores of wheat rust are capable of spreading hundreds if not thousands of kilometers through the atmosphere (Ingold, 1971) . The airborne spread of rust disease has been shown to follow a predictable trend, which starts during the fall with the planting of winter wheat in the southern plains. Any rust-infected plant produces thousands of spores, which are released into the air (Figure 5 .9) by either natural atmospheric disturbance or mechanical disturbance during the harvesting process. Once airborne, these spores are capable of long-distance dispersal, which can cause downwind deposition onto other susceptible wheat plants. The generation time of new spores is measured in weeks, after which new spores are again released from vegetative fungi into the AMB pathway. For example, during the harvest of winter wheat in Texas, the prevailing wind currents are from south to north, which can allow rust epidemics to spread into the maturing crops farther north in Kansas and up into the young crops in the Dakotas (Figure 5.10) . This epidemic spread of wheat rust and the resulting economic destruction produced are indicative of the impact that airborne microbial pathogens can have on agriculture. A factor that complicates the control of such diseases is that chemical treatment for the control of pathogens is viewed as undesirable. This is because many pesticides have long half-lives and their residence in an ecosystem can be extremely harmful. Therefore, instead of using wheat rust fungicides, attempts are being made to breed strains of wheat that are more resistant to the fungi. Another method used for controlling phytopathogenic (plant pathogenic) fungi is spore monitoring as a disease control strategy. In this approach, the life cycle of the fungi, especially the release of spores, is monitored, and fungicide application is timed to coincide with spore release. This approach minimizes use of harmful chemicals. Thus, efficient aeromicrobiology pathway sampling, monitoring, detection and modeling have the ability to aid in the control of airborne pathogens.",

It has long been thought that bioaerosol spread is linked primarily to respiratory pathogens, but there is growing evidence that gastrointestinal pathogens are also important in airborne transmission of disease among animals. One example of bioaerosol spread of a gastrointestinal pathogen is The figure shows the airborne spread of late blight of potato that caused the 1845 epidemic known as the Irish potato famine. Phytophthora infestans spread from Belgium (mid-June) throughout Europe by mid-October. Famine related deaths are estimated from 750,000 to 1,000,000. Economic devastation from this famine caused the population of Ireland to decrease from approximately 8 million to 4 million from 1840 to 1911. .9 Field of wheat highly infected by phytopathogenic wheat rust. The field is being harvested by a hay machine, which is releasing a cloud of rust spores into the aeromicrobiological pathway. These spores can spread thousands of miles and infect other crops downwind, causing catastrophic losses to wheat crops. transmission of Salmonella typhimurium among calves that are housed individually in small pens (Hinton et al., 1983) . The potential for bioaerosol spread of this pathogen was recognized because the initial symptoms resembled those of pneumonia and appeared randomly within these animals, two factors that are not characteristic of oral transmission. Oral transmission generally occurs sequentially from one pen to the next, whereas aerial transmission can carry organisms past nearby pens, infecting calves randomly. Furthermore, Wathes et al. (1988) showed that S. typhimurium could survive for long periods in an airborne state, and calves and mice exposed to aerosolized S. typhimurium developed symptoms, proving that gastrointestinal pathogens could be spread by aerosolization. Finally, Baskerville et al. (1992) showed that aerosolized Salmonella enteritidis could infect laying hens. These hens showed clinical symptoms and were shedding the test strain of salmonellae in their feces within a few days. Thus, the aeromicrobiology pathway can be important even in the spread of diseases for which pathogens are not normally considered airborne.",

The major concern associated with the aerosolization process in relation to waste disposal operations is the exposure of waste disposal workers to pathogenic microorganisms (occupational risk). In addition, nearby population centers are also potential Application of secondary treated wastewater onto agricultural lands. This method is highly efficient at conserving water and has been shown to improve the fertility of soils. Due to the presence of pathogens in wastewater, and the nature of these land application systems, there are high concentrations of bioaerosols generated. Currently, however, there is little epidemiological and microbial risk assessment information available to determine if there may be health concerns for populations living in the vicinity of such operations, though there is a growing base of information on the concentration and types of pathogens found in these bioaerosols. exposure risks (community risk). The potential for aerosolization of pathogens from land application of biosolids has become a nationally debated issue. A major national study on aerosolization from land application in the United States was conducted by Brooks et al. (2005a,b) . This study showed that occupational risks of infection from bioaerosols was greater than for offsite communities, where risks were minimal (Brooks et al., 2012) ",

Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin that is normally associated with ingestion of contaminated food. However, the lethal dose is so small that aerosolization can also be a means of dissemination. The lethal dose for botulinum toxin by inhalation is 0.3 \u00b5g, with death occurring 12 hours after exposure. Death is due to asphyxiation caused by the paralysis of respiratory muscles. Another toxin produced by bacteria is staphylococcal enterotoxin. On occasion, this toxin can be fatal with the lethal dose estimated to be 25 \u00b5g by inhalation. The symptoms include cramping, vomiting and diarrhea, which occur within 1 hour of exposure by aerosolization. An important airborne toxin is lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Hurst et al., 1997) . Lipopolysaccharide is derived from the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. It is also referred to as endotoxin and is a highly antigenic biological agent that, when associated with airborne particles such as dust, is often associated with acute respiratory symptoms such as chest tightness, coughing, shortness of breath, fever and wheezing. Due to the ubiquity of Gramnegative bacteria, especially in soil, LPS is considered by some to be the most important aerobiological allergen. LPS (Figure 5 .15) has three major components: a lipid A moiety, which is a disaccharide of phosphorylated glucosamines with associated fatty acids; a core polysaccharide; and an O-side chain. The lipid A moiety and the core polysaccharide are similar among Gram-negative bacteria, but the O-side chain varies among species and even strains. It is the O-side chain that is responsible for the hyperallergenic reaction. There are many sources associated with the production of high levels of LPS, such as cotton mills, haystacks, sewage treatment plants, solid waste handling facilities, swine confinement buildings, poultry houses, and even homes and office buildings. LPS is liberated when Gram-negative bacteria in these environments are lysed but can also be released when they are actively growing.",

However, dose response is dependent on the source of the material, the duration of exposure and the frequency of exposures (Brooks et al., 2004) . The data in Table 5 .2 illustrate that endotoxin aerosolization can occur during both wastewater treatment and land application of biosolids.

All potential places where water can stagnate in water pipes should be avoided.

            "text": "Unidirectional airflow filtration is a relatively simple and yet effective method for control of airborne contamination. Some filters, for example, high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are reported to remove virtually all infectious particles. These types of filters are commonly used in biological safety hoods. However, because of their high cost, they are not often used in building filtration systems. Instead, other filtration systems that rely on baghouse filtration (a baghouse works on the same principle as a vacuum cleaner bag) are used. Typically, air filters (baghouse, HEPA, etc.) are rated using the dust-spot percentage, which is an index of the size of the particles efficiently removed by the filter, with higher percentages representing greater filtration efficiencies. The typical rating for the filters used in most buildings is 30 to 50%. Studies have shown that a 97% dust-spot rating is required to effectively remove virus particles from the air. Other factors that influence filtration efficiency are related to the type of circulation system and how well it mobilizes air within the building, the type of baghouse system used and the filter material chosen (nylon wound, spun fiberglass, etc.) as well as the filter's nominal porosity (1 \u00b5m\u00c05 \u00b5m). All these factors combine to influence the efficiency of the air filtration and removal of particles including bioaerosols. In spite of the high level of efficiency that can be achieved with filtration, many systems still cannot stop the circulation of airborne microorganisms, especially viruses, and added treatments may be required to ensure that air is safe to breathe.",

Many eradication methods are available, for example, superheating, superdehydration, ozonation and UV irradiation. The most commonly used of these methods is UVGI or ultraviolet germicidal radiation. UVGI has been shown to be able to control many types of pathogens, although some microbes show various levels of resistance. The control of contagion using UV irradiation was tested in a tuberculosis (TB) ward of a hospital. Contaminated air was removed from the TB ward through a split ventilation duct and channeled into two animal holding pens that contained guinea pigs. One pen received air that had been treated with UV irradiation; the other received untreated air. The guinea pigs in the untreated-air compartment developed TB, but none of the animals in the UV-treated compartment became infected. The American Hospital Association (1974) indicated that, properly utilized, UV radiation can kill nearly all infectious agents, although the effect is highly dependent on the UV intensity and exposure time. Thus, major factors that affect survival (temperature, relative humidity, UV radiation, ozone) in the extramural environment can be used to control the spread of contagion in the intramural environment.",

Negative pressure exists when cumulative airflow travels into the isolated region. Examples of this are the isolation chambers of the tuberculosis wards in hospitals used to protect others outside the TB wards from the infectious agent generated within these negative-pressure areas. This type of system is designed to protect other people in the hospital from the pathogens (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) present inside the isolation area. Air from these rooms is exhausted into the atmosphere after passing through a HEPA filter and biocidal control chamber. Positive-pressure isolation chambers work on the opposite principle by forcing air out of the room, thus protecting the occupants of the room from outside contamination. One can reason that the TB ward is a negativepressure isolation room, while the rest of the hospital, or at least the nearby anterooms, are under positive-pressure isolation. Other examples are the hospitals critical care wards for immunosuppressed patients such as organ transplant, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected and chemotherapy patients. These areas are protected from exposure to any type of pathogen or opportunistic pathogens.

Thus, laboratories and specialized equipment used in these laboratories (e.g., biosafety cabinets) are designed to control the spread of airborne microorganisms. There are essentially four levels of control designed into laboratories, depending on the type of research being conducted. These levels of control are termed biosafety levels 1\u00c04, with 1 being the lowest level of control and 4 the highest level of control.

This air is then passed upward through conduits and downward to the work area after passing through a HEPA filter. Room air is also drawn into the cabinet through the top of the unit, where it joins the circulating air and passes through the HEPA filter and into the work area. About 70% of the air circulating in the work area is then removed by passing it through the rear grill of the cabinet, where it is discharged into the exhaust system. The remaining 30% is passed through the front grill, essentially recirculating in the cabinet (Figure 5 .17). .17 Schematic representation of the airflow paths within a typical Class II biosafety cabinet. Room air is dawn in from the top and from the front as indicated by the blue arrows. The nonpurified atmospheric air (blue) entering from the top of the cabinet is drawn in by an air pump (A) and then is purified by a HEPA filter (B) as it enters the workspace. Nonpurified air from the room (blue) entering from the front of the cabinet passes into the front grill and passes up through the top of the cabinet where it also passes through a HEPA filter before entering the workspace (C). This prevents the experiments in the workspace from being contaminated by airborne room contaminants. As the purified room air is exposed to the work environment and becomes contaminated (red) it is passed through yet another HEPA filter before being exhausted to the atmosphere.

Class III cabinets are used for high-risk pathogens (Table 5 .3). All operations in the work area of the cabinet are performed through attached rubber gloves. Class III cabinets use complete isolation to protect workers. All air entering the cabinet is filtered using a HEPA filter, and the air leaving the cabinet is filtered by two HEPA filters in series. The exhaust may also include biocidal treatment such as incineration following the HEPA filtration to further ensure complete biological inactivation. In addition to these safeguards, Class III cabinets are connected with airtight seals to all other laboratory equipment (such as incubators, refrigerators and centrifuges) that is needed for working with the pathogens while using the cabinet. The Class III cabinet must also be connected to autoclaves and chemical dunk tanks used to sterilize or disinfect all materials entering or exiting the cabinet. Another type of containment that typically provides the same level of protection as a Class III biosafety hood is the biological safety suit (Figure 5.19) . The biological suit, unlike biosafety cabinets, operates under positive pressure created by an external air supply, thus protecting the wearer. Like the biosafety cabinets, the biosafety suit isolates the laboratory worker wearing it from bioaerosols. Biosafety suits are typically used in airtight complete biocontainment areas, and are decontaminated by means of chemical showers upon exiting the biohazard area. Some biosafety suits are portable and can be used in environments outside the laboratory such as \"hot zones\" (epidemiological areas that are currently under the influence of epidemic cases of diseases caused by high-risk pathogens) so that microbiologists and physicians working in these areas can minimize their risk of exposure to pathogens.
