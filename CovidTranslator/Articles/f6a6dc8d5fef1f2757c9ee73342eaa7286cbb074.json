Even experienced practitioners often find it difficult to apply their clinical veterinary knowledge and skills that they have acquired while performing a necropsy. Perhaps the first and most important step in overcoming these concerns is recognizing that there are a limited number of diagnostic tools that are commonly used. The appropriate collection of diagnostic samples such as cytology, skin scrapings, fecal flotation, bacterial culture, blood, histopathology, and tissue for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or toxicologic testing is absolutely within the capabilities of every practitioner.",

The most common etiology is a bacterial otitis media associated with Pasteurella multocida. Significant differentials for torficollis include encephalitozoonosis associated with Encephalitozoon cuniculi, other bacterial causes of otitis media, and ear mite infestation. 22 Encephalitozoon cuniculi primarily affects the tissues of the CNS, liver, and kidney. Histopathology of affected tissues is diagnostic. Serology tests are widely available but the incidence of infection and seroconversion exceeds the incidence of clinical encephalitozoonosis. 23 Kidney lesions are often the most striking findings and range from acute congestion and minimal cortical irregularity to marked irregularity and pitting in more chronic cases. ~ The rabbit ear mite, Psoroptes cuniculi, may cause \"wry neck\" as the rabbit tilts its head toward the more affected ear. Unless mites penetrate the middle ear, this parasite does not cause true otitis media or neurologic disease. In all cases of torticollis, tympanic bulla should be opened and examined for purulent material. When bullae are filled with exudative material, bacterial culture should be used for identification.",

            "text": "Gastrointestinal disease may be associated with a variety of bacterial pathogens. Bacterial dysbiosis may result from antibiotic treatment and disruption of normal flora. Dysbiosis frequently results from overgrowth of opportunistic pathogens such as Clostridium difficile. 71 A history of antibiotic use combined with grossly edematons or hemorrhagic cecal mucosa are highly suggestive of antibiotic associated dysbiosis but histopathology and culture should be used for confirmation. 2 A less commonly considered differential affecting younger guinea pigs is coronavirus like infection. Gross lesions consistent with coronavirus like disease are enteritis mostly affecting the distal ileum and increased amounts of mucoid material in the entire gastrointestinal tract. 72 Histopathology should be performed on tissues with lesions. An incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis and significance hampers interpretation especially since it has been demonstrated that clinically normal guinea pigs may shed coronavirus like particles. 73 Diarrhea and death may also be associated with Cryptosporidium sp. or Eimeria sp. infection. 74,75 Cryptospo~4dium wrairi typically affects juvenile animals; lesions consistent with cryptosporidiosis include watery contents in the small and large intestine. Infection with Eimeria caviae is associated with increased fluid and fetid contents of the large intestine. 2 Diagnosis via histopathology or mucosal scrapings may be performed and coinfection with other enteric pathogens such as Escherichia coli should be considered.",

Bordetella is probably the most significant respiratory pathogen of guinea pigs but may be carried as an inapparent infection in some animals. 2, 76, 77 The presence of gross pathology including suppurative exudate in the nares, trachea or lungs is suggestive of bacterial disease and should prompt the clinician to culture affected tissues. Lesions characterized by pleuritis or suppurative exudates in the tympanic bullae or uterus are also possible. Diplocoecal pneumonia associated with Streptococcus pneumoniae may cause fibrinopurulent pleuritis, pericarditis, or peritonitis. 2 The organism may be carried in the absence of disease but culture from lesioned tissues is considered diagnostic and impression smears revealing Gram-positive diplococci may be obtained from affected animals and considered similarly diagnostic. Adenoviral pnetmlonitis is most commonly reported in experimentally manipulated or immunocompromised animals but has been reported as a primary pathogen. 7s Gross findings include consolidation of cranial lung lobes and multifocal puhnonary necrosis. 2 Histopathology of affected lung is highly suggestive of disease, especially in the absence of bacterial pathogens and in the presence of adenovirus particles (verified through electron microscopy). Cytomegalovirus infection of the respiratory tract is generally considered an incidental finding although there are rare reports of systemic cytomegalovirus disease. 79 Gross pulmonary findings associated with foreign body pneumonitis may or may not be present as incidental findings but can be recognized with the use of histopathology.",
