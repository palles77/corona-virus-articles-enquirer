            "text": "Background: Rhinovirus-induced wheezing is an important risk factor for recurrent wheezing. There are no randomized controlled trials on the effect of systemic corticosteroids in patients with this disease. Objective: We sought to study the short-and long-term effects of prednisolone treatment of the first acute, moderate-to-severe, rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode in young children. Methods: After confirming rhinovirus from nasopharyngeal aspirate by using PCR, 79 children with a first wheezing episode at age 3 to 23 months were randomized to receive oral prednisolone (first dose of 2 mg/kg, followed by 2 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses for 3 days) or placebo. The trial was double blind throughout the 12-month follow-up. The primary outcomes were long term: new physician-confirmed wheezing episode within 2 months, number of physician-confirmed wheezing episodes within 12 months, and initiation of regular controller medication for asthma symptoms within 12 months. The primary interaction analysis examined rhinovirus load. Results: Seventy-four patients completed the study (mean age, 13 months; 28% atopic). Long-term outcomes did not differ between groups (all P > _ .30). For short-term outcomes, the prednisolone group had less cough, rhinitis, noisy breathing, severe breathing difficulties, and nocturnal respiratory symptoms at home within 2 weeks (all P < .05). The 25 children with greater than 7000 rhinovirus copies/mL (most sensitive cutoff) benefitted from prednisolone in terms of less risk of physician-confirmed recurrence within 2 and 12 months compared with placebo (both P < .05). Conclusions: Prednisolone cannot be routinely recommended for all young children experiencing their first acute, moderateto-severe, rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode. Prednisolone might be beneficial in a subgroup of children with high viral loads. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2015;135:691-8.) ",

            "text": "Rhinovirus has been detected in 20% to 40% of wheezing children during the first 2 years of life in both hospital and emergency care settings. [1] [2] [3] Rhinovirus-related cause of early wheezing is of particular interest because of its strong association (odds ratios of 3-10 during early life) with recurrent wheezing and doctor-diagnosed asthma up to 13 years of age. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The suggested explanations for this striking association are low interferon responses (ie, impaired viral defense), early airway inflammation (ie, a broken epithelial barrier), and genetic variation at the 17q21 locus in rhinovirus-affected children (ie, might markedly increase the risk of asthma). [10] [11] [12] [13] Overall, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in the treatment of early wheezing have not reported clinical efficacy. [14] [15] [16] Virus-specific RCTs on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)-induced lower airway illness have focused on bronchiolitis and have not found any efficacy of systemic corticosteroids. 17, 18 Previously, in the Vinku study we reported a post hoc analysis of RCT data showing that oral prednisolone during the first wheezing episode with a rhinovirus-related cause and/or eczema reduced the risk of recurrent wheezing over the next 2 months, 12 months, and 7 years. 4, 9, 19 Although no prior study has identified a subgroup of young wheezing children who benefit from systemic corticosteroids, they have not focused on rhinovirus as a cause. The high asthma risk associated with rhinovirus-induced wheezing episodes and our earlier results led us to perform the current RCT on the effect of systemic corticosteroids on a patient's first rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode. We hypothesized that prednisolone decreases the risk of relapse in children with their first rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode.",

The modifying effect of rhinovirus load at study entry on the effect of prednisolone (vs placebo) was tested, including a rhinovirus load-group interaction effect in the Cox and Poisson models. Because of highly positively skewed distribution, rhinovirus load was dichotomized. The cutoff for rhinovirus load was identified by testing for different values and selecting the approximate threshold that yielded the lowest P value for rhinovirus load-group interaction effect.

            "text": "Contrary to our primary hypothesis, prednisolone showed no overall effect on the primary outcomes. The hypothesis was justified because long-term cohort studies had demonstrated that a rhinovirus-induced wheezing episode is an important early risk factor for recurrent wheezing and doctor-diagnosed asthma in children. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Moreover, susceptibility to rhinovirus-induced J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 135, NUMBER 3 wheezing has been associated with many asthma-related factors, such as allergic sensitization, eczema, increased blood eosinophil counts, increased exhaled nitric oxide levels, decreased lung function, illness severity, and maternal atopic asthma; increased IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 responses and decreased IFN-a/b/g/l and IL-10 responses in airway secretions; and broken airway epithelium in vitro. 1, 6, 8, [10] [11] [12] 19, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] In line with these extensive epidemiologic and mechanistic data, in a post hoc analysis we previously found that prednisolone reduced recurrent wheezing at 2-month, 12-month, and 7-year follow-ups in children with rhinovirus, eczema, or both affected by first-time wheezing at the ages of 3 to 35 months. 4, 9, 19 The short-term benefits of prednisolone that we observed (eg, less respiratory symptoms during the 2-week follow-up) are in line with some, 19, 31, 32 but not all, [14] [15] [16] previous studies. In our previous review 14 we found that 7 (44%) of 16 trials showed beneficial effects of systemic corticosteroids on short-term outcomes, whereas 9 (56%) of 16 did not. More recently, researchers have focused on which subgroup might benefit the most or on the role of combined treatments. Alansari et al 32 found that dexamethasone effectively decreased the time to readiness for discharge in infants with bronchiolitis and increased risk of asthma (as determined based on eczema or a family history of asthma) by 31%. Also, use of systemic corticosteroids has effectively reduced the occurrence of relapses resulting in a clinic visit during a 2-month follow-up in hospitalized first-or second-time wheezing children aged 3 to 35 months with associated rhinovirus infection or blood eosinophil counts of 0.2 3 10 9 /L or greater. 19 Thus systemic corticosteroids might have a beneficial effect on short-term outcomes when targeted for children at high risk for asthma, as defined by rhinovirus positivity, eczema, family history of asthma, and/or increased blood eosinophil counts. Moreover, systemic corticosteroids, when combined with nebulized epinephrine, were of borderline significance in reducing the need for hospitalization in infants with bronchiolitis, and the effect was not affected by positive RSV status (rhinovirus was not examined), a personal or family history of atopy, presentation early in the course of illness, or severe illness. 31 Four studies have not shown an effect in children with atopic characteristics, but they have been underpowered to fully address the atopy issue, or the prednisolone was parent initiated. 15, 17, 31, 33 When looking at longer-term outcomes (ie, > _2 months), prednisolone made a difference only for those with high rhinovirus loads. This finding is supported by our previous trial, with 1-and 7-year follow-ups showing long-term effect of prednisolone in rhinovirus-positive children with first-time wheezing. 4, 9 During our previous study, conventional PCR followed by liquid hybridization was used in rhinovirus diagnostics. In the current study this method was replaced by real-time PCR, which more efficiently detects rhinoviruses. 34 Quantitative PCR was not done in our previous study. The most likely explanation for the effect of prednisolone in the group with high copy numbers is that the high rhinovirus load is associated with more severe airway inflammation. 1, 6, [10] [11] [12] 19, 26, 29, 30 Airway inflammation is typically associated with low interferon expression, leading to decreased viral clearance, increased virus replication, and eventually more severe airway inflammation. Epithelial cell cultures with a broken surface are more susceptible to rhinovirus replication than those with an intact surface. 27 In agreement, previous studies have shown a positive association between rhinovirus load and illness severity, as did we with cough severity. 35, 36 With regard to the other factors, the baseline characteristics of rhinovirus-affected participants in our current trial and a previous trial 3 were similar: median age of 0.9 versus 1.2 years, prevalence of atopy of 30% versus 20%, mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of 84 versus 75 nmol/L, and index hospitalization of 80% versus 100%, respectively. Although 25-hydroxyvitamin D is thought to protect against acute respiratory tract infections, 37 both samples had average levels that would be considered sufficient based on current international standards. The susceptibility to viral infections appears to markedly increase at a 25-hydroxyvitamin D level of less than 50 nmol/L in wheezing children. 38 Atopic characteristics, such as eczema, might have importance in first-time wheezing children when considering responsiveness to systemic corticosteroids. 4, 9 Importantly, aeroallergen sensitization, which is a very specific risk factor for asthma among wheezing children, develops rather slowly, is usually not present during infancy, Values are shown as means (SDs), medians (interquartile ranges), or numbers (percentages) of subjects. Data were analyzed by using the 2-sample t test (cough and noisy breathing), the Wilcoxon rank sum test with a Hodges-Lehmann estimate for median difference (expiratory breathing difficulty, nocturnal symptoms, and bronchodilator at home), or Poisson regression analysis (nocturnal symptoms, outpatient clinic visit, hospitalization, oral corticosteroid, and inhaled corticosteroid). Nocturnal symptoms are shown as a categorical variable because of the low frequency of symptoms.

With regard to limitations, we recognize that the study was underpowered to detect a less than 34% absolute difference. Even 10% absolute differences in relapse rates have recently been considered meaningful in wheezing children. 40 The results might not be generalizable to outpatients because 80% of our subjects were enrolled at hospitalization; the sample size was too small to permit meaningful analysis of inpatient versus outpatient interactions. There was a delay in the initiation of study drug in the current trial compared with our previous trial (45 vs 0 hours, respectively) because of completion of rhinovirus PCR. This is why our primary outcome was the time to recurrence and not the short-term (secondary) outcomes. However, we found no association between the delay and primary or secondary outcomes. We checked medical records and interviewed a parent using a standard questionnaire to confirm that there was no previous wheezing episode. Bacterial coinfections were not investigated, and rhinovirus species were not typed.",

However, our results suggest that prednisolone treatment is beneficial in a subgroup of young children with high viral loads at presentation. The apparent effect of prednisolone on long-term outcomes among children with high rhinovirus loads and its benefits on most short-term outcomes warrant further study. Clinically, the challenge is early identification of children at high risk of asthma and identification of an effective intervention to reduce respiratory morbidity. A rhinovirusrelated cause of early wheezing is a promising new marker for these high-risk children, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and clearly, there is a need for a bedside quantitative rhinovirus detection test. Our RCT findings support a role for high rhinovirus load as an important marker in those children with early pulmonary inflammation who might benefit from acute treatment with prednisolone.",
