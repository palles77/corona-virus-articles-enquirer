The outbreak of COVID-19 was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China on December 2019, has now rapidly spread over 50 countries. 1, 2 Clinical spectrum of this disease varied from mild to severe. Fever (88%), cough (67%), and fatigue (34%) were the most common symptoms presented by COVID-19 patients 3 which were similar to those with infections caused by other respiratory viruses, such as Influenza A/B, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. 4, 5 For the prevention and control of COVID-19, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (CDC) initiated testing of SARS-CoV-2 on January 24th 2020 for persons who had a travel history to China and presented fever or any respiratory symptoms within 14 days. Until February 28th, 2105 cases were screened and 34 of them were diagnosed of COVID-19. During this period, 43 suspected patients were admitted to a medical center located in central Taiwan, and two of them were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Through multiplex PCR analysis with FilmArray\u00e4 Respiratory Panel, the non-COVID-19 patients were later diagnosed of infections with other respiratory pathogens. Undoubtedly, early screening and diagnosis is crucial for the treatment and control of COVID-19. To establish the diagnostic protocol for this disease, in this report, we comparatively analyzed the clinical presentations, laboratory data, radiologic findings, and travel and exposure contact histories, of the COVID-19 patients with those with other respiratory infections.",

Productive cough and rhinorrhea appeared on illness day 3. Fever up to 39.1 C and dyspnea developed on illness day 9 and 19, respectively. On 16th February (illness day 20), this patient was admitted to CMUH and diagnosed of COVID-19, as confirmed by positive rRT-PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swab and sputum. Despite of relatively mild symptoms, this patient developed a prolonged and insidious disease course and had gastrointestinal symptoms, presented as upper abdominal dull pain and diarrhea during hospitalization. COVID-19 patient B who also contacted with Taiwan No. 19 case patient on 27th January developed fever up to 38 C on 6 days later (3rd February, illness day 1; Fig. 1A ) and had dry cough as the primary manifestation that persisted until illness day 19. During the third sampling on 24th February, the loads of SARS-CoV-2 in the naso-oropharyngeal specimens from COVID-19 patients A and B were both at an undetectable level. However, their sputum was still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Patient A's sputum remained positive rRT-PCR on illness day 28, and then turned negative on illness day 35. The oropharyngeal specimens rRT-PCR of patient B altered to detectable again on illness day 29 and 33, and sputum rRT-PCR also remained positive at least until illness day 33.",

Therefore, the contact and travel history are the main screening criteria for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid detection tools such as FilmArrayTM Respiratory Panel can aid in early diagnosis of causative pathogens. As demonstrated in this report, the development of mild COVID-19 illness was insidiously initiated and persisted for a long period. The prolonged duration of SARS-CoV-2 detection in naso-oropharyngeal specimens of the COVID-19 patients with mild illness is of concern in epidemic areas. Clinical manifestations of viral respiratory infections range from asymptomatic or flu-like symptoms such as fever, nonproductive or productive cough, myalgia, rhinorrhea, and sore throat, to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organs failure. 10 Various viral pathogens cause community-acquired infections during the cold season in Taiwan. Of which, influenza A/B, human Metapneumovirus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus 1/2/3, coronavirus 229E/NL63/OC43, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, are the most common. 11 The lack of specificity for clinical symptoms, laboratory data, and chest 13, 14 is the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic or presented flu-like symptoms. 15, 16 Under this circumstances, quarantine and active surveillance of suspected patients and the application of rapid detection tools for etiology confirmation is strongly recommended. The confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan belonged to two groups: international migration and locally transmitted. Both COVID-19 patients in this report had no travel history. Upon exposure to Taiwan No. 19 case patient during a family dinner, they were infected. There were two additional family clusters of infections and a cluster of 8 patients infected in a single hospital in Taiwan until 6th March 2020. The reproductive number of COVID-19, ranged from 1.4 to 6.49, 17 was averagely higher than severe acute respiratory symptoms (SARS) in 2003, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2012. 18 Community spread of COVID-19 has occurred in several countries in different continents. China, Hong Kong, Macao, Korea, Italy, and Iran are reported epidemic areas. To prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to expand the exposure risk management to persons who have travel history to epidemic areas, sick or cluster contacts, and to patients who have pneumonia or ARDS without clear explanation.",

The long duration of SARS-CoV-2 shedding and the transmission in patients asymptomatic or with mild illness drastically increase the pandemic potential of COVID-19. Owing to the early wave of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Taiwan, our study was limited by the small number of cases for screening and included 2 COVID-19 patients with mild illness.
