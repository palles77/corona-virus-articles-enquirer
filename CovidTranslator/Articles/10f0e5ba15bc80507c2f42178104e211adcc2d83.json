Indeed, murine coronavirus (MHV) infection provides a well-known experimental model for MS studies. Intracerebral infection of C57BL/6 mice with MHV-A59 revealed that viral replication was efficient and that clearance of infectious virus occurred as soon as 7 days post-infection. Using cDNA arrays, analysis of gene expression profile in the brain revealed a modulation of 80 different genes following infection, with at least 27 of these genes having previously been directly related to innate or acquired immune responses. Concordingly, an important activation of auto-reactive T cells specific to myelin basic protein was demonstrated. Altogether, these results indicate that an MHV infection of the central nervous system (CNS) leads to an important host genomic response implicating immunityrelated genes and to the activation of myelin-reactive autoimmune T cells.",

Genetic and environmental factors, such as viral infections, have often been associated with these pathologies. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and coronaviruses appear on the list of viruses that have been associated with this pathology. More specifically, human coronaviruses (HCoV) and virus-specific antibodies have been detected respectively in the brain and cerebrospinal fluids of MS patients (Burks et al., 1980; Murray et al., 1992; Stewart et al., 1992; Arbour et al., 2000; Salmi et al., 1982) . Furthermore, acute infection of human microglia and astrocytes in primary cultures (Bonavia et al., 1997) and persistent infection of CNS cell lines (Arbour et al., 1999a,b) both demonstrate the neurotropism of human coronavirus.",

Viral replication was demonstrated by detection of infectious virus in both the brain and the liver but clearance took place as early as 7 days post-infection (p.i.) in both organs. In order to investigate the host response during CNS infection, global gene expression studies were performed. The gene expression profile revealed a modulation during 0165 infection with a special emphasis on immune responserelated genes at 7 days p.i. Therefore, we next investigated the effects on immune cells and found the activation of myelin-specific T cells 7 days following MHV infection. Therefore, while an efficient clearance of infectious MHV-A59 virus takes place within the CNS and in periphery, the i.c. infection of genetically susceptible C57BL/6 mice induced both an important modulation of the gene expression profile within the CNS and the activation of selfreactive T cells. Moreover, these auto-reactive cells appear to be tissue-specific, recognizing myelin basic protein (MBP), as no such cells are detected against either ovalbumin or a mouse lung homogenate.",

This was performed using cDNA arrays containing PCR-generated probes specific for murine genes. To limit inter-animal variations, RNA from 3 mouse brains was pooled for each condition tested. To ascertain that the results were reproducible and that the modulation observed between MHV-infected and mock-infected brains were accurate and not only due to random modulation, the threshold was set at 3-fold differences in the level of expression as suggested by others (Chapoval et al., 2001) and, according to our own experience with this type of nylon membrane, this expression level was to be above 5000 arbitrary densitometric units. According to these parameters, 80 of the 1176 genes tested showed significant changes in their level of expression and most of the variations were up-regulations observed on day 7 p.i. This global survey of gene expression indicates that several different types of genes appeared to be differentially expressed in the brains of MHV-infected mice compared to mock infected animals (Table 2 ) and a classification adapted from Ibrahim et al. (2001) is suggested. Nevertheless, we wished to focus on genes that are somehow associated to the immune response of the host, leaving the other categories of differentially expressed genes for future studies. Amongst these changes, several modulations of well-characterized immune-related genes were observed. The up-regulation of Ii (Ia-associated invariant chain), CD3g, galectin-3, CXCL10 (IP-10) expression were then corroborated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR by using the RNA pool from 3 mouse brains used previously for the cDNA arrays analysis (Fig. 2) . These up-regulations were also confirmed using RNA from an individual mouse (data not shown). Thirty mice were infected with 100 PFU and splenocytes were cultivated in 96-well plates as indicated in Section 2.6. The proliferation data (cpm) were considered positive in wells where the count was at least 1000 (before substraction of the background count) and where it was more than twofold superior compared to control antigen (DBT cell lysate for MHV and RPMI culture medium for MBP). Splenocytes from 30 uninfected mice were cultivated the same way. S.I.: Stimulation Index.",

It has been reported that C57BL/6 mice are susceptible to MHV infection and show demyelination following infection (Lavi et al., 1984) . MHV is neuroinvasive and can reach the brain through the olfactory nerve (Barthold, 1988; Lavi et al., 1988; Perlman et al., 1989; Barnett and Perlman, 1993) . Intra-cerebral inoculation bypasses this natural way and allows the administration of the virus directly to the brain. The A59 strain leads to demyelination while being less neurovirulent than JHM (Robb et al., 1979) .

Mice were injected i.c. with 100 PFU of MHV-A59. Seven days p.i., splenocytes were cultured with viral, myelin or control antigens for 48 h. Cells were pulsed with [ 3 H]thymidine and harvested. Statistical significance was determined using the Student t-test for unpaired data. *pb0.0001. The proliferation data were considered positive in wells where it was at least twice superior compared to control antigen (lysate of DBT cells for MHV, no antigen for MBP, ovalbumin and mouse lung homogenate). observed at 7 days p.i. (Table 2 ) and, as previously mentioned, most of these genes (26 out of 44) have been previously related to immune responses. Genes like Tap-1, Ii or cathepsin S encode proteins involved in antigen presentation. As part of a normal immune response, an increase in antigen presentation can contribute to the clearance on the infectious agent but has the potential to increase the presentation of self antigens, such as myelin components, which can be exposed following lysis of the infected cells or damage caused by local CNS inflammation. An up-regulation in the expression of some chemokines (CXCL9, CXCL10) was also observed. These chemokines bind CXCR3 on the surface of T and NK cells (Farber, 1997; Loetscher et al., 1996) . CXCL9 and CXCL10 are involved in T-cell recruitment in the acute response following MHV infection of mouse (Liu et al., 2000 (Liu et al., , 2001a . CXCL10/IP-10 also contribute to demyelination in chronic response (Liu et al., 2001b) . Moreover, IP-10 (\u00c0/\u00c0) mice infected with MHV recruited less T lymphocytes in the brain, had a delayed viral clearance from the brain and showed less demyelination in the CNS (Dufour et al., 2002) . Moreover, the early increase in the level of expression of CXCL-10, as early as 1 and 2 days p.i. (Table 2) , is of particular interest as this chemokine is known to be essential for the activation and recruitment of NK cells as early as 2 days p.i. to the CNS of MHV-A59-infected mice, helping to initiate virus clearance even before the T cells start to significantly infiltrate the CNS (Trifilo et al., 2004) . Furthermore, it was also shown that these MHV-A59activated NK cells produced IFN-g within the CNS (Trifilo et al., 2004) . The kinetics of CXCL-10 expression is in exact concordance with the literature as an increased expression in ependymal cells as early as 1 day p.i. was shown before (Lane et al., 1998) and its on-going sustained increase in expression correlates perfectly well with these results as this increase become concomitant with the increase of the gene coding for IFIT3, one of the IFN-ginduced gene present on the ATLAS 1.2 II cDNA array. This latter result may indicate that IFN-g is already being produced by infiltrating NK cells after the first burst of CXCL-10 increase. However, if not controlled adequately, the expression of chemokines such as CXCL-9 and CXCL-10 at a high level (Table 2 ) later in the process, when no more infectious virus is detected within the brain, could contribute to the recruitment of more and more immune cells, a situation that could lead to an autoimmune response partly related to the presence of MBP-autoreactive T cells. The HMGB1 gene is also slightly increased (3.7-fold) at 1 day p.i. This gene has a role in local inflammation and is expressed by microglia (Takata et al., 2003) and macrophage (Wang et al., 2004) and was recently shown to stimulate the production of IFN-g by NK cells (Demarco et al., 2005) . This early increase (1 day p.i.) in the level of expression may be associated with the early steps in the process of microglial cell activation. Moreover, as the expression of HMGB1 is increased 17-fold at 7 days p.i., this can be correlated with the infiltration of macrophages from the periphery. The early (1 day p.i.) and late increase (7 days p.i.) in the expression level of the HMGB 1 gene may also be associated with the concomitant elevation of the CD83 antigen, which is usually associated with dendritic cell (DC) maturation (Messmer et al., 2004) . Moreover, even though they appear to be absent from the brain parenchyma, dendritic cells are one of the first leukocytes to be recruited within the CNS during the early phase of development of EAE, probably coming from a subpopulation of immature DC that reside in the meninges and the choroid plexus (Karman et al., 2004) . Moreover, as they mature and participate to CNS inflammation, they are likely to also play a role against CNS infection (Pashenkov et al., 2003) . Another IFN-induced gene with a significant increased level of expression is the transcription factor ISGF3-gamma. The expression of this particular gene is mainly controlled by type I IFN, especially IFNh (Suhara et al., 1996) , and the expression of the gene coding for this cytokine was previously shown to be increased as early as 3 days p.i. after a CNS infection by MHV-A59 (Rempel et al., 2004) . As MHV-A59 replication is also affected by IFNh (Garlinghouse et al., 1984) , a local production of this cytokine by astrocytes following MHV infection (Wang et al., 1998) could contribute to the first steps of viral clearance.",

Indeed, using a very precise method of RNAse Protection Assay, Rempel and colleagues observed a slight but significant increase in the expression of the genes coding for IL-12 p40 and IL-1h, IL-6 and TNF-a as early as 3 days p.i. Using the system of small cytokine array (GEArray), Li and colleagues were also able to observe an increase in the level of expression of these 4 proinflammatory cytokines as well as in the level of expression of IL-15 at 5 days p.i. However, by using the cDNA macroarray system, which allows to screen for the modulation of expression of 1176 different genes, we were not able to measure any significant modulation in the expression of the genes coding for those cytokines. The genes coding for IL-6 and TNF-a, not being present on the nylon membranes ATLAS mouse 1.2 II, could not be studied directly and there was no measurable modulation of any genes, present on the membrane, that are known to be regulated by TNF-a. However, by applying our criteria of 3-fold modulation and 5000 densitometric units (described in Section 2.4), no significant modulation in expression of the gene coding for IL-15, IL-1 h and IL-12 p40 could be observed. As the gene coding for IL-1 h and IL-12 p40 were shown to be significantly modulated during an MHV-A59 infection of the mouse CNS in two different reports, our result may be surprising. Nevertheless, our criteria for screening the significant modulations of the mouse transcriptome following infection appear to be appropriate as many of the significant modulations we observed are in perfect concordance with other studies on the subject.",

Moreover, recent reports (Rempel et al., 2004; Phillips et al., 2002) have directly demonstrated that intracranial infection with either MHV-A59 or MHV-JHM induces an infiltration of T cells within the CNS at 7 days p.i. CD18 is involved in leukocyte extravasation (Gahmberg et al., 1998) . Galectin-3 and Fc receptors are found at macrophage and microglia cell surface and are involved in binding and phagocytosis of myelin (Smith, 2001) . Moreover, in a model of EAE, macrophage and microglial cells overexpress galectin-3 (Reichert and Rotshenker, 1999 ). An increase in the expression of CD3g and CD8a point towards a T-cell infiltration into the CNS. The presence of immune cells in the brain could lead to direct or indirect damage. These modulations suggest that viral infection of the brain is followed by an increase in antigen presentation and cytokines and chemokines expression and by extravasation of leukocytes at the site of infection at 7 days p.i., when the infectious virus has been eliminated from the brain.",

Furthermore, it was also reported several years ago that rats infected with MHV-JHM showed T-cell proliferation upon stimulation with myelin basic protein (MBP), and adoptive transfer of these cells to naive rats led to an experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE)-like disease. However, prior to the current study, there had been no reports of T cell responses specific to a particular myelin antigen in MHV-infected mice. Therefore, as the robust genomic response observed (Table 2) indicates that several of the genes that were modulated in their expression are immune response-related, it led us to directly investigate the immune cell response, with a special emphasis on T cell, following MHV infection of the CNS.",

Bovine MBP was presented to infected mouse T cells. MBP represents 25-30% of total myelin proteins in the CNS (Deber and Reynolds, 1991) . This protein is much conserved between species (Martenson, 1984) and has 79% identity with mouse MBP (alignment with SIM, using an algorithm described by Huang and Miller, 1991) . In our model, the maximal T-cell response to MHV-A59 was detected with mouse splenocytes harvested at 7 days p.i. At this moment, proliferation upon stimulation with MBP was observed in T cells from MHV-infected but not from control mice (Fig. 3) . It is worth noting that this activation was specific as indicated by the absence of proliferation when cells were stimulated by control antigens (ovalbumin or mouse lung homogenate). Not all the infected mice showed a specific immune response for MBP, nor for MHV-A59. Despite this observed variability between immune responses at 7 days p.i., the difference in proliferative responses to viral and myelin antigens in infected and control groups was highly significant ( pb0.0001).",

Altogether, these results suggest a role for the inflammatory response in the autoimmune process, which may involve underlying mechanisms such as molecular mimicry or epitope spreading, or a combination (Talbot et al., 1996; Miller et al., 2001) .

Our observations open up future studies on several immune-response-related genes but also on other genes which role during response to MHV infection has not been anticipated.

Indeed, even though different reports (Matthews et al., 2002b; Sutherland et al., 1997) have strongly suggested that autoimmunity does not play an essential role in demyelination following an infection by this virus, it cannot be ruled out that the induction of the process implicates autoimmunity.
