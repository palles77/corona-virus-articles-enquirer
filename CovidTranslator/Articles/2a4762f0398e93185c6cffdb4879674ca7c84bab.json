The inhibition assay of HpFabD was performed based on the \u03b1-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase-coupled system, while the inhibition assay for HpFabZ was monitored by detecting the decrease in absorbance at 260 nm with crotonoyl-CoA conversion to \u03b2-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The juglone/FabZ complex crystal was obtained by soaking juglone into the HpFabZ crystal, and the X-ray crystal structure of the complex was analyzed by molecular replacement approach. Results: Juglone was shown to potently inhibit HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ with the half maximal inhibitory concentration IC 50 values of 7.0\u00b10.7, 20\u00b11, and 30\u00b14 \u00b5mol/L, respectively. An inhibition-type study indicated that juglone was a non-competitive inhibitor of HpCGS against O-succinyl-L-homoserine (K i =\u03b1K i =24 \u00b5mol/L), an uncompetitive inhibitor of HpFabD against malonyl-CoA (\u03b1K i =7.4 \u00b5mol/L), and a competitive inhibitor of HpFabZ against crotonoyl-CoA (K i =6.8 \u00b5mol/L). Moreover, the crystal structure of the HpFabZ/juglone complex further revealed the essential binding pattern of juglone against HpFabZ at the atomic level. Conclusion: HpCGS, HpFabD, and HpFabZ are potential targets of juglone.",

H pylori has been recognized as a pathogenic bacterium that chronically infects approximately 50% of the world's human population [2] . The rapid infection of H pylori has become a severe threat against human health. Usually, the treatment of H pylori infections involves the administration of a combination of antibiotics and other drugs. However, the overuse and misuse of antibacterial agents have resulted in the generation of antibiotic resistant strains. For example, in the UK, the metronidazole resistance was found by 31.7% against H pylori isolates [3] . Accordingly, the alarming rise of antibiotic resistance among the key bacterial pathogens has strongly stimulated an urgency to develop novel antibacterial agents acting on new drug targets.",

Most plants and microbes employ only the forward pathway from cysteine to homocysteine and methionine, and mammals carry out only the reverse transsulfuration, while fungi take up transsulfuration in both directions [11] . CGS (EC2.5.1.48), encoded by the metB gene, is a pyridoxal 5\u2032 -phosphate-dependent enzyme responsible for the \u03b3-replacement reaction of an activated form of Lhomoserine with L-cysteine, leading to L-cystathionine. For microorganisms, such a reaction is the first step involved in the transsulfuration pathway that converts L-cysteine into L-homocysteine. Since CGS is absent in non-ruminant animals that require a dietary source of L-homocysteine or Lmethionine [12, 13] , it has thus been regarded as an attractive target for antibiotic discovery [14] . However, the metB gene seems to be unessential for H pylori growth as reported by Salama et al [15] .",

            "text": "Fatty acid biosynthesis (FAS) is an essential pathway for the survival of the organism since fatty acid is the major component of cell membranes and possesses important biological functions. In nature, according to the enzymes involved in the pathway, fatty acid biosynthesis is divided into 2 types: type I (FAS I) and type II (FAS II) [16] [17] [18] . In the FAS I system, which found in animals, the biosynthesis of fatty acid is catalyzed by a multi-enzyme, which is a single polypeptide with 8 distinct domains. However, in the FAS II system, the reactions are carried out by a series of structurally dissociated enzymes as discovered in most bacteria [16, 17] . Due to the large differences between these 2 FAS systems, enzymes like FabD (EC2.3.1.39) and FabZ (EC4.2.1.60) involved in type II fatty acid biosynthesis have been developed as potential targets for the discovery of antibacterial agents [17] . FabD catalyzes the transfer of a malonyl moiety from malonyl-CoA to holo-ACP, forming malonyl-ACP as the elongation substrate for the fatty acid biosynthesis [19] [20] [21] [22] , while FabZ is the primary dehydratase that participates in the elongation cycles of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid synthesis [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

As shown in the analyzed complex structure, juglone binds to HpFabZ in 2 binding models similar to our previous binding model for HpFabZ binding to the inhibitor [30] (Figure 4) . In model A, juglone fits into the groove around the entrance ( Figure 4A ) and locates between the phenol ring of Tyr100 and the pyrrolidine ring of Pro112', forming a sandwich structure (the prime indicates a residue from the other subunit in the dimer). As shown in Figure 4B , the carbonyl oxygen of juglone forms H-bonds with the nearby water chain, which also forms Hbonds with the back bone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Phe65', Ile111', Val 146', and Phe101, as well as the back bone nitrogen of Val113'. In model B, juglone entered into the middle of the tunnel near the active site of HpFabZ (His58 and Glu72'; Figure 4C ) and was stabilized via the hydrophobic interactions between residues Leu21, His23, Ala75, Phe83, Ile98, Val 99, and Phe59'. At this stage, the carbonyl oxygen of juglone Ala75, the N\u03b52 of His 23 and His58', and O\u03b51 and O\u03b52 of Glu72 ( Figure 4D ).",

In binding model B, the inhibitor locates into the middle of the tunnel via hydrophobic interactions. Juglone also fits in these 2 models (Figure 3) , of which the position in model A is corresponding to the groove around the entrance, and the position in model B is corresponding to the active site of the tunnel near the catalytic residues His58 and Glu72, in agreement with the competitive inhibitory properties of juglone against HpFabZ determined by the inhibition type study. However, in comparison with this previous HpFabZ-inhibitor crystal structure analysis, 2 major differences are found for juglone binding to HpFabZ. First, in the binding model of HpFabZ/juglone, besides the \u03c0\u2212\u03c0 or hydrophobic interactions, juglone was also stabilized by the H-bonds formed by the water chain between the enzyme and juglone. The other major difference is that in binding model B, juglone is inserted deeper to the tunnel (near Phe83) with a more suitable hydrophobic environment for the binding, different from the previously reported HpFabZ-inhibitor binding case, where the inhibitor formed a sandwichlike conformation with Ile98 and His59' of HpFabZ. It is thus espected that the information based on the HpFabZ/juglone complex would be useful for structure-guided drug design which might provide novel competent HpFabZ inhibitors.",
