            "text": "Background: Angiotensin (ANG) II is involved in experimental hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) degrades ANG II and is thus protective, but is downregulated in adult human and experimental lung fibrosis. Hyperoxia is a known cause of chronic fibrotic lung disease in neonates, but the role of ACE-2 in neonatal lung fibrosis is unknown. We hypothesized that ACE-2 in human fetal lung cells might be downregulated by hyperoxic gas. Methods: Fetal human lung fibroblast IMR90 cells were exposed to hyperoxic (95% O 2 /5% CO 2 ) or normoxic (21% O 2 /5% CO 2 ) gas in vitro. Cells and culture media were recovered separately for assays of ACE-2 enzymatic activity, mRNA, and immunoreactive protein. results: Hyperoxia decreased ACE-2 immunoreactive protein and enzyme activity in IMR90 cells (both P < 0.01), but did not change ACE-2 mRNA. ACE-2 protein was increased in the cell supernatant, suggesting protease-mediated ectodomain shedding. TAPI-2, an inhibitor of TNF-\u03b1\u2212converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17), prevented both the decrease in cellular ACE-2 and the increase in soluble ACE-2 (both P < 0.05). conclusion: These data show that ACE-2 is expressed in fetal human lung fibroblasts but is significantly decreased by hyperoxic gas. They also suggest that hyperoxia decreases ACE-2 through a shedding mechanism mediated by ADAM17/ TACE. Articles also purchased from Calbiochem, SanDiego CA. The fetal lung fibroblast cell line IMR 90 was purchased from ATCC, Manassas, VA. All other materials were of reagent grade.",

The fetal lung fibroblast cell line IMR-90 was subcultured in complete media and harvested at confluence, and then assayed for ACE-2 by western blot and enzyme activity. Cells were studied at passage 13-15 in all experiments. To demonstrate ACE-2 assay specificity, we measured the level of ACE-2 in the presence of its competitive inhibitor, DX600 (11). Cell lines at confluence were then exposed to hyperoxia at 95% oxygen with 5% CO 2 for 72 h, while incubating in 5% fetal bovine serum. Control cells were exposed to 21% oxygen with 5% CO 2 for 72 h with the same media. At the end of the 72-h culture period, cells were taken out from the incubators and media aspirated out and rinsed once with serum-free media. We also treated some cells with 10 \u00b5mol/l of TAPI-2, before incubating in hyperoxia. These were also allowed to be exposed for 72 h and were treated under the same conditions as the others described above.",

BPD remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality during the first year of life, and some of these infants have significant respiratory problems throughout childhood, including increased airway reactivity and the development of restrictive airway disease (1) . Hyperoxia induces lung injury and may contribute to BPD. A comprehensive review of the literature reveals a strong association between exposure to hyperoxia and subsequent expression of comorbidities. Hyperoxia can directly cause lung injury by generation of reactive oxygen radicals. Prolonged exposure of neonatal mice to hyperoxia results in impaired alveolarization and capillary development and in increased lung fibrosis that is similar to human BPD (2) .",

In studies of tissue fibrogenesis, the tissue RAS is believed to play a key role in initiation and progression of fibrous tissue accumulation in a variety of organs. Both ACE inhibitors and Angiotensin receptor antagonists have been shown to prevent fibrogenesis of the heart (4), liver (5) , kidney (6) , and lungs (7, 8) . ANG II, produced by ACE, is the main effector molecule in the RAS. ANG II is a potential pulmonary profibrotic mediator which activates ANG II type I receptor and stimulates collagen synthesis. Studies done in vivo showed that the angiotensin system was upregulated in oxygen-exposed fetal lung fibroblasts (9) . The main function of ACE-2 is to convert the octapeptide angiotensin II to a heptapeptide ANG 1-7. This limits the accumulation of ANG II and protects against experimental lung fibrosis.",

Table 1 shows the number of cells with disrupted plasma membrane integrity, as measured by trypan blue and expressed as a percentage of total cells. Cell cultures exposed to hyperoxia showed a modest (less than 1%) but statistically significant increase in dead cells compared to cells exposed to room air, if the exposure was followed by a 24-h period of recovery (P < 0.01). Figure 1 shows western blotting for caspase 9 as a marker of apoptosis which, when normalized to \u03b2-actin, showed no significant changes by densitometry. Together, these data suggest a very slight decrease in the viability of hyperoxia-treated cells following a recovery period, but only in a very minor fraction (<1%) of the cells. Figure 2 shows the effect of hyperoxia on ACE-2 immunoreactive protein on western blotting. Both ACE-2 immunoreactivity and enzyme activity were significantly decreased in cells treated with hyperoxia when compared with cells treated with normoxia. This reduction (74.6%, P < 0.01 by densitometry) only occurred when cells were allowed to recover by incubating in normoxic serum free media for 24 h.",

Cell-free culture supernatants were then harvested separately from the cell monolayer and were concentrated and subjected to western blotting for ACE-2 (upper panel Articles might provide much needed targets for future design of interventions. Lang et al (9) . recently showed that angiotensin II (ANGII) mediates the profibrotic effect of hyperoxia on cultured human lung fibroblasts, but these authors did not study the potential contributions of ACE-2, which degrades ANGII, to the angiotensin-induced increase in collagen production stimulated by hyperoxia. Moreover, previous work showed that ACE-2, which protects against lung fibrosis in animal models by degrading ANGII, is downregulated in the lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis through mechanisms yet to be fully identified (11) . Together, these issues led to our hypotheses that: (i) hyperoxia might downregulate ACE-2 and (ii) modulation of ACE-2 might be useful in the management and prevention of hyperoxia-induced lung injury. For example, maintaining high levels of tissue ACE-2 by prevention of its shedding, and/or replacement of the protein through administration of biologically active enzyme, may hold potential as therapeutic strategies for treating hyperoxic lung injury. In support of this theory, a pharmaceutical preparation of recombinant human ACE-2 (rhACE-2) is currently in clinical trials for acute lung injury (GlaxoSmithKline, pipeline drug GSK2586881). ACE-2, a carboxypeptidase which degrades Angiotensin II, was shown to be protective but downregulated in human interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and in experimentally-induced lung fibrosis by Li et al (11) .. A clear role for ACE-2 in modulating acute lung injury was shown by the demonstrations of Imai et al (10) . who showed that the absence of ACE-2 in ACE-2 knockout mice exacerbates experimental acute lung injury. To date, the potential role of ACE-2 in hyperoxic lung injury has not been explored.",

In adult animal models of acute lung injury (10,21), ACE-2 was shown to inhibit lung edema formation and inflammation as well as fibrogenesis. Thus, although little is known about the role of ACE-2 in alveolar septation, Figure 7 . Proposed role of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) in hyperoxia-induced lung fibrosis. Angiotensinogen (AGT) produced by either alveolar epithelial cells or myofibroblasts (3) can be cleaved by a variety of pulmonary aspartyl proteases (3) to yield angiotensin (ANG) I, which in turn is cleaved by various lung enzymes to yield the profibrotic ANGII. ANGII is degraded by ACE-2 to yield the antifibrotic peptide ANG1-7, which acts through its receptor mas. Hyperoxia causes, by mechanisms yet unknown, the release of ACE-2 from the cell through ectodomain cleavage mediated by increased ADAM-17/TACE. Through this mechanism, hyperoxia is theorized to promote fibrosis through both (a) promoting accumulation of ANGII (8, 9) and (b) reducing production of the antifibrotic peptide ANG1-7 (21 Figure 6 .

Regardless, a small percentage of children with BPD today present with classic findings of the \"old BPD\", and it may be that a continuum exists between the milder forms and the more severe presentations. Therefore, the study of ACE-2 and other components of the RAS in hyperoxic lung injury and the possibility of ameliorating the most severe, and possibly the milder, forms of BPD associated with hyperoxic injury remains critical. ACE-2 has also been shown to be involved in virus-induced lung disease. ACE-2 is the cellular receptor the SARS-Coronavirus, is required for coronaviral entry, and inhibition of its shedding by the TACE inhibitor is related to the severity of the SARS-CoV infection (14) (15) (16) . Liu et al (22) . showed that ACE2 protein levels were significantly downregulated after infection with H1N1 viruses, but was dispensable for viral replication. They also found that ACE-2 cleavage could be regulated by influenza neuraminidase. Zou et al (23) . showed that in experimental mouse models, infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 virus results in downregulation of ACE-2 expression in the lung and increased serum ANG II levels. Genetic inactivation of ACE-2 causes severe lung injury in H5N1-challenged mice, confirming a protective role of ACE-2 in H5N1-induced lung pathologies. The same authors also demonstrated that the administration of recombinant human ACE-2 ameliorates avian influenza H5N1 virusinduced lung injury in mice. Thus, the potential influence of ACE-2 downregulation by hyperoxic gas on viral infection will be an interesting topic for future investigation.",

To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that ACE-2 is expressed by human lung fibroblasts and is downregulated by hyperoxia. It is also the first to document that this downregulation could be prevented by TACE antagonist in hyperoxia-treated cells. Given the known function of ACE-2 in preventing lung collagen deposition in experimental lung fibrosis (11) , its expression by the fibroblastic cells most responsible for collagen synthesis is not surprising. Indeed, other authors have shown that lung collagen accumulation in neonatal rats exposed to hyperoxic gas could be prevented by blockers of angiotensin receptor AT1 (25) .",

Although the 95% oxygen did cause a very minor increase in necrotic cells (<1% see Table 1 ), it seems unlikely that this small but statistically significant effect would have physiologic significance. The hyperoxic gas did, however, cause a significant decrease in ACE-2 ( Figure 2) ; whether or not subphysiologic oxygen concentrations reduce ACE-2 will be an interesting topic for further research. In the light of all published evidence, the downregulation of ACE-2 would be expected to lead to accumulation of ANG II and its downstream profibrotic pathways (see Figure 7) . Indeed, hyperoxic gas was previously shown to increase ANGIImediated collagen synthesis by human lung fibroblasts (9), and either inhibition or gene knockdown of ACE-2 increased autocrine ANGII generation by human lung cells in culture (11) . Furthermore, the heptapeptide ANG1-7, the product of ACE-2, was shown to be antifibrotic in lung tissue (21, 27) and inhibition of ACE-2 reduces its production (see Figure 7) . Accordingly, the reduction of cellular ACE-2 induced by hyperoxia would be expected to promote fibrogenesis through both increasing ANGII and simultaneously decreasing ANG1-7.",

As was demonstrated by Haga et al (15) ., the present study also showed that the effect of hyperoxia on ACE-2 appears to involve the upregulation of ADAM17/TACE mRNA and protein (see Figure 6) , which in turn mediates enzymatic shedding of the ACE-2 ectodomain and its release into the extracellular space.

Inhibition of these effects by TAPI-2 suggests a mechanism mediated by ADAM-17/TACE-induced shedding of ACE-2 from the cell surface.

Cell debris from the sample was removed through centrifugation. Samples were prepped for dialysis using Spectra/Por Biotech Cellulose Ester Dialysis Membranes with a MWCO 10 kDa (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Membranes containing the samples were then kept at 4 \u00b0C in a 2 l beaker of deionized water with gentle stirring until the media sample became clear (~2 d). At the completion of dialysis, samples were transferred to a new 15 ml canonical tube and frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Completely frozen samples were lyophilized using the Labconco Freeze Dryer/Freezone 4.5 system according the manufacturer's protocol. Lyophilized samples were diluted in 100 \u00b5l of sterile deionized water. Western blot for ACE-2 and \u03b2-actin was done by standard protocols.",
