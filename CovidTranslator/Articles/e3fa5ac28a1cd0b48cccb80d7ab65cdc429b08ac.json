The human pulmonary system is vulnerable to infections due to contact-based inoculation of infectious material in droplets through the eyes, nose, or mouth, and airborne transmission is effective as seen e.g. in the plethora of viral respiratory diseases affecting individuals of all age groups [1] .Thus, respiratory viruses pose a continuous pandemic threat, of which coronaviruses and specifically the genus Betacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae is a subset. During the past decades, humans have been challenged with a number of emerging viral respiratory infections with pandemic potential including the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which emerged in China in 2002 [2, 3] , swine-origin pandemic (H1N1) influenza A virus which emerged in Mexico in 2009 [4] and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [5] .",

In December 2019, a previously unknown coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan city in China [6, 7] which initially resulted in a cluster of viral pneumonia cases [8] and later caused an escalating number of reported infections in humans in China and globally [9] [10] [11] . The mortality of the emerging coronavirus of 2019 seems mainly to be caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [12] which may be associated with comorbidities and followed by multiple organ failure leading to death [13] . It is probable that this 2019 coronavirus outbreak is not the last one due to a coronavirus. A provisional name was initially given to this coronavirus as 2019-novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and was recently designated as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) [14] . The WHO announced that the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 is referred to as coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) [15] .",

            "text": "Since the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, bats have been the suspect of harbouring emerging viruses. Several studies have recently reported the detection of coronaviruses of pandemic potential [26, 27] . Genetic evolutionary analysis of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that this virus is genetically related to two bat coronaviruses [7, 28] . Contrary to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, human infections due to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported to a quite large extent outside the epicentre of the infection. The numbers of infections due to SARS-CoV-2 continued to grow since its emergence till January 31 (Fig. 1) , and as of the date of this publication, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.onehlt.2020.100124 Received 4 February 2020; Received in revised form 20 February 2020; Accepted 22 February 2020 reported cases in humans globally [11, 29] . Through rapid and frequent international air travel, infections due to SARS-CoV-2 have spread to over 36 countries around the world causing more than 2600 deaths including deaths outside China in Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, Iran, South Korea, Italy and France have been reported as of 24 February 2020 [9, 29] . The epidemiological data available at the time of this publication are summarized in Fig. 2 [10] . Infections due to SARS-CoV-2 are yet unreported at the time of this publication in South American countries. Except for Egypt where one travel-related case was reported on 12 February 2020, COVID-19 infections are not yet reported elsewhere in Africa. As of the date of this report, approximately 97% (n = 77,150) of infections were reported in China [29] , however this number of infections may not reflect the true situation in China since additional cases may not have been reported to health authorities at the time of the outbreak. The case fatality rate is calculated by dividing the number of known deaths by the number of confirmed cases. The resulting number, however, does not represent the true case fatality rate and might be off by orders of magnitude [30] . The true case fatality rate is unknown at this stage of the outbreak, and its precise estimate is impossible at present [30, 31] . The current estimates of case fatality rate of SARS-CoV-2 at any time point of analysis should be interpreted with caution since the outcome of the emerging COVID-19 is yet unknown. There are 33 fatalities reported outside China as of the date of this report. On the contrary, the case fatality rate with SARS was 10% and the US identified eight patients with no fatalities. For MERS, the fatality is 35% and the US identified two patients with no fatalities, and sporadic MERS cases are being reported mainly from the Arabian Peninsula till this day. As a comparison, Influenza A virus infections in the current season (2018-2019) led to an estimated 490,561 hospitalizations and 34,157 deaths in the US [32] . Although the numbers for Influenza A virus infections are not obtained in the same way as for SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, and thus are not directly comparable, they still serve as an important reminder of the large numbers of deaths a 'lowmortality' infection can cause when widespread in the community.",

The implementation and development of One Health collaborations on a global scale are critical to reduce the threats of emerging viruses [42, 43] . Regarding SARS-CoV-2 in particular, there are several aspects that needs a One Health approach in order to understand the outbreak, and to mitigate further outbreaks of a similar virus. SARS-CoV-2 is likely a batorigin coronavirus that was transmitted to humans through a spillover from bats or through yet undetermined intermediate animal host (avian, swine, phocine, bovine, canine, other species) or wild animals. Fig. 3 depicts a transmission hypothesis of SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the potential intermediate host is yet to be determined. The list of animals which were sold in Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan ranged from poultry (turkey, pheasants, geese, roosters, doves) wild birds (Peacocks, swans, others species), and exotic animals, to reptiles and hedgehogs. The animal list included frogs, camels, wild rabbits, reptiles, snakes, deer, crocodiles, kangaroos, snails, civet cats, goats, centipedes, and cicades [45, 46] . There are no data available in scientific literature on the detection and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 from environmental samples.

As a previous example, an HKU-2 bat origin, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome (SADS)coronavirus emerged in the swine population in 2017 in Guangdong, China [27] . Surveillance for SARS-CoV-2 in nonhuman hosts including swine and wild animals and further genetic analysis of SARS-CoV-2, and other SARS-like CoVs may reveal the possible intermediate host of the recently emerged human SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the current outbreak and is a very important One Health measure. When the transmission chains and ecology of SARS-CoV-2 are clearer, the next step is to identify potential interventions to mitigate transmission. The unavailability of information on the possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 and leaving the intermediate host undetermined are of high risk to humans and may well result in new outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 or similar viruses, and future epidemics. In addition, exploring the intermediate host(s) of SARS-CoV-2 will help conduct further investigations to evaluate the host-pathogen relationship, disease dynamics and the possibility of reverse zoonosis. These interventions will likely include measures of several different types including several different disciplines [42, 43, 48] . Hypothesizing that bats will be proven as SARS-CoV-2 reservoirs and that adaptation to humans took place in an intermediate host in a live animal market, the following measures would be important: i) Decreasing the risk of transmission from the natural host. This includes more knowledge of the natural ecology of the virus, so that high-risk transmission situations can be avoided. Also, it is important to consider transmission risks when new interfaces between bats and humans are created, e.g. when human habitations extend into bat habitats. Finally, there are important social science/behavioural measures conveying the message to the public which interactions with bats should be avoided (based on disease ecology knowledge).",

Depending on which animal(s) is proven to constitute the intermediate hosts(s) for SARS-CoV-2, this may however be more or less difficult in practice. Likely, live animal markets play an important role in this process, and they need to be addressed in any true One Health approach [48] . However, it is crucial to consider the cultural context of these markets meaning that again, social sciences are important in this process. Also, this means that the most viable solution may not be to close down live animal markets but perhaps to 'sector' them so that fewer different species mingle in one specific market and that the specific intermediate host(s) for SARS-CoV-2 may be removed from the markets, or rigorously tested for the virus.",

However, the implementation of One Health policies in China is challenged by several barriers [48, 51] . Should strict implementation of One Health measures in China have been implemented, the emergence of two coronaviruses (SARS in 2002-3 and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019) may have been prevented. Alarmingly, One Health policies are not yet implimented in several parts of the world where hotspots of infectious diseases are present which may result in potential emerging infections affecting humans. SARS-like coronaviruses of pandemic potential have been recently reported. [54, 55] . Surprisingly, a recent study highlighted the risk of bat coronavirus outbreaks in China [56] . Therefore, further investigations using one health approaches will help predict virus hotspots and their cross-species transmission poential and the implimenation of one health policies are critical and urgently required.",
