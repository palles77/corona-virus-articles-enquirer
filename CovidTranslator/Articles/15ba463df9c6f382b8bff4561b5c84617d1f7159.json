            "text": "Host-pathogen interaction dynamics can be significantly affected by environmental conditions, either directly, via e.g. improved pathogen transmission rates, or indirectly, by affecting host susceptibility to pathogen attacks (1). In the case of directly transmitted diseases, such as human influenza, multiple environmental parameters such as local temperatures and humidity impact on 5 virus survival and transmission, with significant consequences for the seasonal and geographic patterns of outbreaks (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . A recently discovered coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is the aethiological agent of a pandemic disease, Covid-19, causing severe pneumonia outbreaks at the global scale (7) . Covid-19 cases are now reported in about 170 countries and regions worldwide (8) . Three months after the discovery of SARS-CoV-2, the global pattern and the early dynamics of Covid-10 19 outbreaks seem highly variable. Some countries have been experiencing limited growth and spread of Covid-19 cases, while others are suffering widespread community transmission and nearly exponential growth of infections (8) . Understanding the drivers of early growth rates is pivotal to predict progresses of disease outbreaks in the absence of containment measures (9, 10), yet no study has so far assessed the role of environmental variation in the worldwide growth of 15 Covid-19 cases. Given the impact of environmental conditions on the transmission of many pathogens, we tested the hypothesis that the severity of Covid-19 outbreaks across the globe is affected by spatial variation of key environmental factors, such as temperature, air humidity (5, (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) , and pollution [fine particulate matter (16); see methods]. We then evaluated if this could help to illustrate global variation in the risk of severe Covid-19 outbreaks in the coming months. 20 Relying on a publicly available global dataset (8), we computed the daily growth rates r of confirmed Covid-19 cases (Covid-19 growth rate hereafter) for 121 countries/regions (see the Methods section). We limited our measure of epidemics growth rate to the first 5 days after .

Variation at these early epidemic growth rates should best reflect the impact of local environmental conditions on disease spread. We restricted analyses to data reported 5 before March 19, as during that week many regions of the world adopted stringent containment measures even in absence of large numbers of reported cases. For instance, on March 17, 37 US states closed schools to prevent disease spread, including several states with less than 25 confirmed Covid-19 cases (19). We also considered additional factors that could affect SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, such as human population density and government per-capita 10 health expenditure (see Methods).",

The comparison of models with different 5 combinations of predictors confirmed temperature as the variable with the highest relative importance in explaining variation of r 50 (Table S1), and temperature was the only parameter included in the best-fitting model (Tables S2-S3 ). Temperature and humidity of the outbreak month showed a strong, positive relationship across regions (Fig. S1 ), thus they could not be included as predictors in the same model. When we repeated the analyses including humidity 10 instead of temperature, r 50 varied significantly and non-linearly with humidity, peaking at ~0.6-1.0 kPa (Fig. 1B, Tables S4-S5 ). The best model including humidity also showed slightly larger growth rates in countries with greater health expenditure (Table S5) , possibly because of more efficient early reporting and/or faster diagnosis of Covid-19 cases. Results were highly consistent if we calculated growth rates after minimum thresholds of 25 or 100 cases (r 25 and r 100 , 15 respectively) instead of 50 (Tables S3 and S5 ). Human population density and air pollution showed very limited relative importance values (always < 0.50; Table S1 ), suggesting that they play a relatively minor role in determining Covid-19 growth rates, at least at the coarse spatial scale of this study.",

Our spatially-explicit analysis suggests that, at least in some parts of the world, ongoing containment efforts could benefit from the interplay between pathogen spread and local climate. We do not claim that climate is the single major driver of Covid-19 spread. The huge variation of Covid-19 growth rates among regions with 5 similar climate indeed suggests that diverse and complex social and demographic factors, as well as stochasticity, may strongly contribute to determine the severity of Covid-19 outbreaks. Yet, climate can contribute to explain variability in global patterns of Covid-19 growth rates. In the coming months, we may thus expect that large areas of the Southern Hemisphere will show environmental conditions promoting severe Covid-19 outbreaks. Despite climate may mitigate 10 Covid-19 growth rate, in absence of containment actions severe outbreaks are possible also in warm regions (Fig. 1C) , thus stringent measures to prevent disease spread remain pivotal in all the areas of the world (18) . 15 ",

Initially, US data were reported by county but, as of March 9, they were reported at the state level. We therefore merged all US county data before March 9 to state level, and used statelevel time series for subsequent calculations. With the exception of US data, in all other cases we maintained the original country/region information adopted by the JHU-CSSE. The datafile 5 considered for the analyses was downloaded on March 19, 2020, and included confirmed Covid-19 cases until March 18, 2020. From this dataset, we selected data for all countries/regions for which local outbreaks were detected. We define a local outbreak event when at least 50 positive cases were detected in a given country/region, and calculated the growth rate of confirmed Covid-19 cases between day 1 and day 5, when day 1 was the day at which the 50 cases 10 threshold was reached. We calculate the daily growth rate r of confirmed Covid-19 cases for each country/region, assuming an exponential growth as: r = [ln(n cases day 5 ) -ln(n cases day 1 )] / 4. We checked the robustness of our estimates of growth rate by calculating daily growth rate after the first 25, 50 or 100 cases (r 25 , r 50 and r 100 , respectively). Growth rates estimated at different thresholds were strongly positively correlated (Pearson's correlation coefficients, r 25 vs. 15 r 50 : r = 0.74; r 50 vs. r 100 : r = 0.81).",

Previous studies showed that, for coronaviruses and influenza viruses, survival is generally higher at low temperature and low values of absolute humidity (2, 5, 6, 12, 20) . For each country/region, we thus calculated the mean monthly values for temperature (\u00b0C) and vapor pressure (kPa) for January, February and March on the basis of the WorldClim 2.1 raster layers at 10 arc-minutes 20 resolution (22) . We relied on WorldClim climatic data because homogeneous data on conditions for the period January-March 2020 are not yet available at a global scale (see e.g.",

As additional predictors, we considered mean human population density (24) (population density hereafter, expressed in inhabitants/km 2 ) and per-capita government health expenditure (health expenditure hereafter) (indicator 'Domestic General Government Health Expenditure (GGHE-D) 5 per Capita in US$; average of 2015-2017 values downloaded from the World Health Organization database at https://apps.who.int/nha/database). Health expenditure was available at country-level only: hence, regions within countries were assigned the same health expenditure value. Finally, it has been proposed that air pollution, and especially fine atmospheric particulate, could enhance the persistence and transmission of coronaviruses (16, 25) . We therefore extracted 10 values of annual concentration (\u00b5g/m 3 ) of ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for 2016 from the NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (26) , and calculated the mean abundance of PM2.5 for each country/region.

We adopted a model selection approach to identify the variables most likely to affect the global variation of Covid-19 growth rate (29) . We built models representing the different combinations of independent variables, and ranked them on the basis of Akaike's Information 10 Criterion (AIC). AIC trades-off explanatory power vs. number of predictors; parsimonious models explaining more variation have the lowest AIC values and are considered to be the \"best models\" (29) . For each candidate model, we calculated the Akaike weight \u03c9 i , representing the probability of the model given the data (30). We then calculated the relative variable importance of each variable (RVI) as the sum of \u03c9 i of the models where each variable is included. RVI can 15 be interpreted the probability that a variable should be included in the best model (29, 31) . Model selection analyses and the calculation of RVI can be heavily affected by collinearity among variables. In our dataset, temperature and humidity showed a very strong positive correlation ( Fig. S1 and Table S7 ); furthermore, population density was strongly positively associated with PM2.5 ( Figure S1 and Table S7 ). Therefore, temperature and humidity, or population density 20 and PM2.5, could not be considered together in the same models (31, 32) . All other predictors showed weak correlations and should not cause collinearity issues (32) (Table S7) . We therefore repeated the model selection for different combinations of uncorrelated variables. First, we .

Variation of Covid-19 growth rates in relation to climate, and spatial predictions for different months. Variation of confirmed Covid-19 cases growth rates for the first 5 days after reaching a minimum threshold of 50 cases (r 50 ) during the January-March 2020 pandemic outbreak in relation to A) mean temperature and B) mean absolute humidity of the outbreak month. Partial regression plots (37) of the best-fitting linear mixed models (LMMs) of r 50 in 5 relation to temperature and humidity, respectively (Tables S3-S5 ). The quadratic terms of both temperature and humidity were highly significant (temperature: F 1,87 = 14.4, P < 0.001; humidity: F 1,84 = 7.82, P = 0.006; full details in Tables S3 and S5). Shaded areas are 95% confidence band. C): global pattern of r 50 ; the size of dots is proportional to the observed r 50 values. The background shows the spatial prediction of growth rates according to mean March 10 temperatures (22) . Predictions are based on the best-fitting LMM of r 50 in relation to mean temperature of the outbreak month (Table S3 ). D-E: Spatial prediction of growth rates according to mean June and September temperatures (22) , highlighting that conditions for rapid disease spread appear in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere.",

The predicted global distribution of Covid-19 growth rates based on March temperatures showed favorable conditions for disease spread in most temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, and matched well with the observed spatial distribution of Covid-19 10 growth rates during the January-March global outbreak(Fig. 1C). The expected seasonal rise in temperatures during the next months could results in less suitable conditions for Covid-19 spread in these areas. Conversely, seasonal variation of temperatures could accelerate disease spread in large areas of the Southern Hemisphere, including south America, south Africa, eastern Australia and New Zealand, and at the high latitudes of the Northern hemisphere(14)",
