The fermentation of undigested dietary carbohydrate by colonic flora yields gases (CO 2 and H 2 ) and short chain organic acids. These organic acids can disrupt the intestinal mucosa and initiate inflammation driven predominantly by resident mast cells and by granulocytes which are recruited from blood. A systemic acidosis ensues derived from intestinal acids, not classic lactic acidosis produced from anaerobic metabolism. The systemic acidosis further compromises inflamed bowel leading to bowel necrosis.",

Vascular (ischemia reperfusion) injury and infection are infrequent causes of NEC and both are considered as Secondary NEC. Primary NEC is an inflammatory process without a clear understanding of its genesis. Both lead to intestinal necrosis but there remain specific subtleties differentiating them [3, 6] . Without regard to the cause of severely damaged intestine, the treatment is the same, including cessation of feedings, gastric decompression, parenteral nutrition, supportive care, correction of acidosis, hypotension and blood loss, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and transfusion as necessary. Serial examinations are performed and abdominal X-rays are taken in an attempt to detect intestinal perforation early. A perforation may be managed by peritoneal drainage or a laparotomy to resect necrotic bowel, commonly leaving a diverting intestinal stoma. Unfortunate complications include short bowel syndrome, strictures, adhesions, entero-colonic fistulas, peritoneal abscesses and various complications of prolonged parenteral nutrition.",

There is decreased digestion and absorption of many essential nutrients. There is limited ability to both secrete enzymes as well as decreased intestinal motility. Undigested carbohydrate is substrate for intestinal flora which produce organic acids and gases. The liver which metabolizes a number of compounds absorbed from the intestine does so with variable degrees of success. The preterm infant's immature intestinal barrier is less efficient at controlling toxins and organisms, specifically bacteria and viruses that are able to induce mucosal disruption. These organisms may initiate a local inflammatory response releasing mediators that are toxins. These should be removed by the liver, to prevent a severe systemic response. Table 2 delineates the characteristics of Primary and Secondary NEC [12, 14, 15] . The unfed infant commonly has multiple organ involvement before the bowel damage which is limited to a single site, commonly within the small bowel [11] . If the infant has been fed, the onset is much later (beyond 7 days) with over 25% of cases occurring after a month of age. The affected site is the distal ileum and proximal colon where undigested substrate (carbohydrate) first meets a significant load of bacteria. The intestine is the first organ affected and then there is subsequent systemic illness.",

The majority of the babies have not had an apparent hypoxic-ischemic insult and one quarter of the cases of NEC occur beyond a month of age, suggesting perinatal events have little to no significance in Primary NEC.

In a canine model of NEC, two hours of hypoxia and resuscitation, if the dogs were sacrificed within 24 h there was intestinal vascular congestion and hemorrhage [17] .

            "text": "Modeled after the concept that Helicobacter sp. causes gastric ulcers, recently there has been a concerted effort to determine a specific pathogen responsible for causing the intestinal inflammation of NEC. Several studies have shown there is a change in the intestinal flora in children who develop necrotizing enterocolitis in that the proteobacteria constitute as much as 70% of the organisms in the stool, in cases within three days preceding the clinical diagnosis of NEC [28] . Included in this group are the previously mentioned Gram negative rods E. coli, Klebsialla sp. and others. Despite the systematic search, no consistent pathogen has been identified by culture techniques or by genomic analysis. The organism colonizes the GI tract while the baby is being fed sterile liquid formula or breast milk. The hypothetical organism would have to be one that preferentially affects the distal ileum and proximal colon, the primary sites of disease in preterm babies. No other intestinal or colonic pathogen has shown any similar pattern. There is no seasonal pattern as is commonly found with intestinal infections. Toxins have rarely been identified in preterm NEC. Although an important etiology for GI disease in older children they are not an issue in newborns in that toxin receptors are not yet developed.",

            "text": "To initiate intestinal damage a mechanism to disrupt the mucosal barrier is a central concept. Only three of the many mechanisms of disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier in animal models [29, 30] seem to be of any significance. These are ischemia reperfusion injury, bacterial toxins, and organic acids. Since there is minimal likelihood of bacterial toxins or ischemic reperfusion injury, the organic acids should be the focus. Inflammation likely begins with carbohydrate (lactose) malabsorption and leads to bacterial fermentation and the generation of multiple organic acids, short chain fatty acids which disrupt the mucosal barrier. A local activation of the proinflammatory defense response along with poor motility and stasis initiates intestinal inflammation and potentially necrosis. A number of cells are responsible for the inflammation including cells which initiate and exacerbate the process. These are listed in Table 3 . Of particular note here is the mast cell [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The mast cell has not been well studied since it is consumed in the inflammatory process and is no longer present in necrotic tissue. The mast cell has over 30 different mediators, some rapidly eluted, some from preformed granules, and others secondary or newly generated. Mediators reported associated with NEC (Table 4) include Leukotrienes C4, D4, Interleukin-6,8 oxygen radicals, platelet activating factor and thromboxane all of which can be found in an activated mast cell [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

            "text": "Of the original list of systemic and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms of feeding-associated Primary NEC the one critical factor is mixed metabolic acidosis. With hypoxic ischemic injury the lactic acidosis is transient and readily managed. The mixed metabolic acidosis of NEC is sustained which often takes many hours to fully resolve. Using tandem mass spectroscopy, we have examined the whole blood organic acid profile of babies in the NICU with severe metabolic acidosis (Fig. 1) . Babies (N = 28) with hypoxic ischemia injury, and conditions other than NEC have lactic acid as the primary circulating metabolite causing the acidosis. Babies with NEC (N = 8) and severe metabolic acidosis had propionic acid as the primary organic acid. Propionic acid is one of the important metabolic fermentation products of members of the proteobacteria specifically E. coli, and Klebsiella sp. [24, 25] . Endogenous sources of propionic acid result from catabolism of a small number group of amino acids. Protein catabolism is unlikely in preterm infants who are growing after having been fed successfully. The primary source of the propionic acid producing metabolic acidosis is the intestinal bacteria which continue to generate acid as long as substrate is available. This explains the location of NEC as distal and proximal colon where the most rapid fermentation occurs. Fermentation more distal is less likely since the substrate is consumed especially in the context of poor motility, inflamed distal ileum and proximal colon. Based on newborn screening program data from New York State (NY State DOH -personal communication) preterm infants <34 weeks gestation often have limited capacity to clear propionic acid. This organic acid is metabolized only by the liver. Other organic acids such as lactic and short chain fatty acidic with fewer than 4 carbons (C4) are metabolized by the Krebs Cycle present in the majority of tissues. In newborn screening programs propionic acid is a common false/positive in babies who are fed. The propionic acid is elevated prior to 34 weeks gestation and resolves without true disease. This suggests a maturational defect of the liver to metabolize propionic acid. The enzyme (propionyl CoA carboxylase) converts propionic acid to methylmalonyl-CoA and a Vitamin B12 dependent enzyme rearranges it to succinyl CoA the precursor of succinic acid, which is within the Krebs cycle. Prior to birth without intestinal colonization there is no generation of organic acids from the intestine and therefore no need to have the hepatic enzymes functional.",
