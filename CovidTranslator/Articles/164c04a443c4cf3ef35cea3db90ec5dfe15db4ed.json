The gold nanoparticles showed target-specific aggregation with viral particles via hemagglutinin-sialic acid binding. A linear correlation was observed between the change in optical density and dilution of chemically inactivated influenza B/Victoria and influenza B/ Yamagata. Virus dilution (hemagglutinination assay titer, 512) of 0.156 vol% was readily detected. The upper limit of the linearity can be extended with the use of more sialic acid-gold nanoparticles.",

Hemagglutinin is a surface protein on various viral species that can bind to sialic acid on targeted cell surface (Sauter et al. 1992) . The binding of viral proteins to sialic acid has been studied for different pathogenic viruses, such as influenza virus (Sauter et al. 1992; Varghese et al. 1997; Weis et al. 1988 ), human parainfluenza virus (Suzuki et al. 2001) , human coronavirus (Vlasak et al. 1988 , Kunkel, Herrler 1993 ) and a specific serotype of rhinovirus (Uncapher et al. 1991) . Based on the binding capability of sialic acid to certain viruses, it is possible to design a colorimetric sensor for detecting virus using self-reporting plasmonic nanoparticles, which display plasmon shift upon binding to viral particles. Such a quick and user-friendly detection method based on the binding between the influenza virus envelope protein hemagglutinin and sialic acid that is capable of effectively identifying individuals or animals infected with virus can help with early therapeutic intervention and reduce the spread of infection.",

The assembly of metallic nanoparticles usually results in a red shift of the plasmonic peak and has been well adopted into various detection schemes with specific targeting elements displayed on the nanoparticle surface for many targets, such as polynucleotides (Elghanian et al. 1997; Storhoff et al. 2004) , enzymes (Pavlov et al. 2004) , cells (Medley et al. 2008) , and heavy metals (Darbha et al. 2008) . Still, there have yet to be reported for actual virus detection. Herein we report the development of sialic acid stabilized gold nanoparticles (SA-AuNPs) through a simple one-pot synthesis and their use in the detection of two influenza virus type B, subtypes Victoria and Yamagata. In our method, sialic acid was used without any chemical modification which is often time consuming and costly, such as previously reported sialic acid functionalized gold nanoparticles (Niikura et al. 2009; Papp et al. 2010 ).",

Most of the hydroxyl and amine groups of SA-AuNPs are located at the opposite end to the carboxylic group. It is reasonable to project that the carboxylic group will face outward after SA-AuNPs are formed. The SA layer on AuNP surface prevents the aggregation of the AuNPs in solution. In the presence of viral particles, single AuNPs can attach to hemagglutinin on viral particle surface, resulting in shorter distance between AuNPs.

A solution containing 0.2 nM SA-AuNPs and 5 v% of the medium was prepared and absorption spectrum was measured after 20 min ( Figure 4A ). Since the absorption spectrum of the medium overlaps somewhat with the plasmonic peak area of SA-AuNPs, absorption spectrum of the medium was subtracted from that of the SA-AuNPs and medium mixture ( Figure 4A , dotted line). The corrected absorption spectrum of the SA-AuNPs in media matched well with that of SA-AuNPs in water, indicating that the presence of medium does not cause SA-AuNP aggregation. Additionally, the potential for virus binding nonspecifically to nanoparticles and cause aggregation was tested. Gelatin-AuNPs, with similar spherical shape and size distribution ( Figure 4B inset, diameter of ~20 nm by TEM analysis) but lacking sialic acid were assayed for aggregation in the presence of viral particles. No change was observed in either the plasmonic band or the 600~700 nm region.

This pre-treated virus solution was then incubated with SA-AuNP solution and aggregation was assayed by changes in absorbance in the UV-Vis spectrum.

At higher concentrations of virus, (e.g. 2.5 and 5 v%), as ratio of virus to particles increases, the proportion of SA-AuNPs that can be bound to the same viral particle decreases. This results in longer interparticle distance between neighboring SA-AuNPs on the viral particle surface, and less signal. We carried out another set of colorimetric tests using a higher concentration of SA-AuNP solution (0.8 nM), while maintaining the same concentrations of virus solution. The results in Figure 6E show that the linear range of \u0394OD vs. concentration of added virus solution has extended to 2.5 v% of virus in the solution. This illustrates the importance of having an excessive amount of SA-AuNPs in the starting solution when applying this scheme for virus detection. To validate these results with another virus preparation, influenza B/Yamagata subtype was also tested with 0.4 nM SA-AuNPs solution. The results are similar to those of influenza B/Victoria, and shown in Figure 6F .",

UV-Vis absorption spectra measured at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 min after the addition of 1.25 v % influenza B/Victoria. Overall absorption spectra (A), change of OD 610 over time (B), particle size analysis results measured before (C) and after (D) addition of 1.25 v% influenza B/Victoria. ",
