Through intense molecular research on the regulation of lymphocyte fate, the Fas receptor and other tumor necrosis factor receptors as well as their ligands have emerged as key regulators of T lymphocyte apoptosis. We are studying genetic abnormalities of this death pathway, particularly in the context of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and other non-ALPS conditions affecting lymphocyte homeostasis. These studies have led to further investigations of the regulation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, the molecular basis for programmed cell death and viral cytopathicity, mechanisms of autoimmunity, and regulation of mature T-cell tolerance. Our investigations promise to provide insight into the molecular mechanisms behind the regulation of immune response and contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and treatment methods for autoimmune diseases.",

Our discovery of a family with homozygous mutations in caspase-8, posed an interesting scientific puzzle. We would have expected the patients to be similar to Type II patients; however, they exhibited only minor elevations of the characteristic DNT cells and manifested profound immunodeficiency. An extensive workup of early signaling events showed that caspase-8 deficiency specifically abolishes NF-\u03baB activation due to antigen receptor stimulation of T or B lymphocytes and Fc receptor stimulation of Natural Killer (NK) cells (1) (Figure 1 ). We discovered that caspase-8 causes the I-kappaB kinase (IKK) \u03b1,\u03b2 complex to associate with the CARMA1, Bcl10, MALT1 (CBM) complex to form an NF-\u03baB-activating holoenzyme. IKK\u03b1,\u03b2 recruitment and phosphorylation as well as NF-\u03baB nuclear translocation required the enzyme activity of fulllength caspase-8. By these experiments, we established that caspase-8 functions not only as a pivotal molecule for death receptor signaling, but also has a key role in NF-\u03baB induction through antigen or Fc receptors. Interestingly, caspase-8 subserves these two different functions in lymphocytes by adopting different molecular forms in different functional contexts. As our discovery was based on a single family (our extensive search around the world for another family was unsuccessful), we went on to confirm our human observations by subsequent experiments with collaborators using conditional knockouts of caspase-8 in lymphocytes in mice (2) . Further studies on this project will aim to elucidate the substrate of caspase-8 in immunoreceptor signaling and to characterize new gene defects in genetic abnormalities of immune homeostasis.",

The failure of DISC formation accounted for the lack of apoptosis induction. However, we were intrigued by examples of death domain mutations that still allowed the formation of a normal signaling complex, yet still failed to produce an apoptotic response in cells. We therefore initiated cell biology studies of the receptor on the cell surface. These revealed that a key feature of signal transduction was the lateral association of the liganded receptors into large assemblies (involving thousands of receptor trimers) that could be visualized microscopically (3) . We termed these higher order assemblies \"signaling protein oligomerization transduction structures\" (SPOTS). In specific ALPS cases, we determined that mutations in the death domain prevented SPOTS formation thereby explaining the defective signaling function. Thus, the study of these atypical ALPS Fas mutants revealed a crucial signaling step that had not been recognized previously.",

One group of such patients shows no defect in apoptosis after Fas stimulation. These patients have been a fascinating puzzle because we inferred that they have alterations in a completely different death pathway. We interrogated the intrinsic mitochondrial mechanisms of apoptosis that are regulated by Bcl-2 family members. One patient sample was from a 50-year old male who manifested autoimmunity, chronic lymphadenopathy, and increased DNT cells. Our biochemical analyses revealed decreased levels of Bim, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. Gene expression microarrays, combined with bioinformatic analysis, pinpointed the defect to NRAS -a gene not previously implicated in autoimmunity (4) . Molecular analysis revealed a heterozygous germline Gly13Asp \"activating\" mutation of the NRAS oncogene that does not impair CD95-mediated apoptosis. We found that an increase in active, GTPbound NRAS augmented RAF/MEK/ERK signaling. This decreased the pro-apoptotic protein BIM which inhibited mitochondrial apoptosis. RNAi knockdown of the mutant N-Ras rescued apoptosis in the patient's cells whereas expression of mutant allele in normal lymphocytes recapitulated the patient's apoptosis effect. Our data show that the NRAS mutation principally affects an apoptosis pathway that predisposes to cancer and disrupts lymphocyte homeostasis and tolerance.",

Since the first functional studies of NF-\u03baB, literally hundreds of genes have been shown to be controlled by NF-\u03baB. Nevertheless, the patterns of gene regulation are often specific to the stimulus. We therefore initiated experiments to understand this regulatory specificity. We performed a simple experiment in which the Rel A (p65) subunit of the NF-\u03baB complex was used in a tandem affinity purification and mass spectrometry proteomic screen to identify any tightly associated proteins. Perhaps the biggest surprise in this research was the discovery of a third non-Rel subunit that is an intrinsic part of the NF-\u03baB DNA binding complex (6) . The third subunit, RPS3 -a member of the family of K homology (KH) domain proteins, confers specific binding to specific nucleotide versions of the otherwise degenerate DNA binding site. Our discovery of the first new subunit of NF-\u03baB in over 20 years suggests that there are different NF-\u03baB complexes in the nucleus that masquerade as a single DNA-binding complex. Also, we found several new components of the signal transduction complex from the antigen receptor that provide a new understanding of how the signal is transmitted. Our future work will address the mechanism by which RPS3 confers gene-specific NF-\u03baB regulation and the identification of additional subunits that control RPS3-independent NF-\u03baB targets. Thus far, our preliminary results have identified other KH domain proteins that serve as additional subunits of NF-\u03baB.",

To uncover which viral functions(s) are required for cell death, we systematically mutated, alone and in combination, the open reading frames of the NL4-3 strain of HIV type I (HIV-1). Elimination of the vif and vpr accessory genes together, but not alone, blocked viral cell death and G 2 cell cycle arrest (7) . The convergence of these two cellular events raised a theoretical problem with our explanation of the loss of CD4(+) T cells. We therefore constructed a mathematical model of viral dynamics in vitro in terms of three effective time-dependent rates: those of cell proliferation, infection, and death. Using a mathematical model of viral dynamics in vitro, we could show that the viable target cells were predominantly depleted by direct cell death rather than cell cycle blockade (8) . Because both vif and vpr accessory genes cause both G 2 arrest and cell death, we believe that these are intimately related, and we are examining the molecular mechanism of cell cycle blockade. These findings may provide an important insight into the molecular mechanism of viral pathogenesis in AIDS.",

We discovered that HSA appeared on the surface of the target cells in two phases: passive acquisition due to association and fusion of virions with target cells, followed by active protein expression from transcription of the integrated provirus. The latter event was an obligatory step leading to decreased target cell viability. Using a mathematical model of in vitro viral dynamics based on several time-dependent factors, we showed that the predominant contribution to the depletion of viable target cells results from direct cell death rather than cell cycle blockade. We inferred that the death rate of HIV-infected cells is 80 times greater than that of uninfected cells and that the elimination of the vpr protein reduces the death rate by half. Our approach provided a new method for estimating time-dependent death rates associated with virus infection.",

SARS had the potential to be a global health threat and very little was known about why this particular coronavirus was so highly lethal to humans. In collaboration with Kanta Subbarao, LID/NIAID, we therefore investigated the viral cytotoxic component(s) and mechanism of cell killing. We found that SARS-CoV induces prominent nonapoptotic cell death through disruption of the Golgi apparatus. This cell death depends on expression of 3a, one of 10 novel open reading frames present in SARS-CoV but not found in other human coronaviruses. Over-expression of Arf1, a Golgi-associated protein that stabilizes Golgi structure and function, rescued virus-infected cells from death by restoring Golgi integrity. We found that vaccinia virus, a poxvirus unrelated to SARS-CoV, also causes Golgi disintegration and cell death. With Bernard Moss, LVD/NIAID, we showed that the vaccinia protein F13L is responsible for these effects and a single amino acid substitution, D319E, abolishes its ability to cause Golgi-mediated cytopathicity. Thus, our results define virus-induced Golgi disintegration, which can be induced by a variety of different viruses including poliovirus, as a cytotoxic event that could be modified by the use of Golgistabilizing drugs.",

For non-apoptotic programmed cell death, we have confirmed that autophagy indeed can lead to programmed cell death 9 (Yu et al., 2005) . We also defined the molecular pathway in which the receptor-interacting protein (RIP) leads to Jun N-terminal kinase activation, which induces cell death by autophagy. Using gene knockdowns, we showed that autophagic death requires the genes Atg7 and Beclin-1 and is strongly promoted by caspase-8 inhibition. Thus, caspase-8 regulates an ancient non-apoptotic cell death pathway involving autophagy. We also considered two major hypotheses to explain autophagic death -either the cell eats too much of itself or eats the wrong thing. Molecular examination of ZVAD-induced autophagic death revealed that catalase was selectively degraded (9) . This confirmed the notion that the cell was eating a protein that caused adverse consequences. This resulted in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, membrane lipid oxidation, and loss of plasma membrane integrity leading to necrosis. Inhibition of autophagy by chemical compounds or knocking down the expression of key autophagy proteins blocked ROS accumulation and cell death. The cause of abnormal ROS accumulation is the selective autophagic degradation of the major enzymatic ROS scavenger, catalase. These findings unveil a molecular mechanism for the role of autophagy in cell death and provide insight into the complex relationship between ROS and nonapoptotic programmed cell death. Clinical therapies involving caspase inhibitors may arrest apoptosis but may have the unanticipated effect of promoting autophagic cell death through ROS toxicity.",

Because tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) has an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid and septic arthritis, TNF\u03b1 blockers such as etanercept (Enbrel) or infliximab (Remicade) have been remarkably successful pharmaceuticals.

We found that p60-PLAD proteins block the cellular effects of TNF\u03b1 in vitro and potently inhibit arthritis in four different animal models. Thus, PLAD-based therapeutics may have clinical value in the treatment of human arthritides and other diseases involving TNFR superfamily receptors.

The lack of tolerance in hemophiliacs permits immune responses that foster the development of switched IgG antibodies against Factor VIII, which impair its function in coagulation. Since all of the epitopes are contained in a single protein, it presents an ideal target. The scientists of Wellstat have done pioneering work in electrochemiluminescence (ECL), which is especially useful for antibody detection in plasma. We have developed highly sensitive and specific tests that may be used in both mice and humans. These can detect inhibitory antibodies against Factor VIII or insulin autoantibodies (IAA) in type 1 diabetes. In NOD mouse experiments, our IAA test can detect mice who will become diabetic with high specificity. Our nonradioactive test can be performed in one hour, whereas the currently used radioimmunoassays take 48 hours and require a radiolabeled reagent.",

For the clinical diagnostic tests, we have established collaborators for testing each in upcoming human clinical trials. For therapy, we are in the process of preparing various tolerogenic proteins. We are planning to prepare both mammalian and E. coli expression constructs for the four principal candidate proteins identified as a target antigens in type 1 diabetes: insulin, GAD 65, Hsp60, and IA-2. These will be used for the development of both therapeutic ECL tests as well as preclinical experiments on deletional tolerance.",

While the suppressive effects of Treg cells have been extensively discussed, the fate of effector cells has not been quantitatively examined in vivo or in vitro. We therefore undertook a line of experimentation to address the involvement of apoptosis in Treg suppressive effects.",

            "text": "We have found that Treg cells induced apoptosis of effector CD4+ T cells that quantitatively account for the suppressive effect in various in vitro assays (13) . We also showed that Treg cells did not affect the early activation, particularly IL-2 gene transcription, or proliferation of effector CD4+ T cells in response to TCR stimulation. Rather, Treg cells induced effector CD4+ T cell death due to consumption of survival cytokines produced by the effector cells and required the proapoptotic protein Bim. Also, it was associated with a lower activation of the prosurvival kinase Akt and less phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bad. These effects can be nullified by adding back survival cytokines (typically those that utilize the common gamma chain in their receptors). Thus, the high level expression of survival cytokines receptors on Tregs coupled with the fact that they consumed, but do not produce, survival cytokines cause them to induce cytokine deprivation apoptosis of T effector cells. We found that cytokine consumption was essential for the survival of the Treg cells themselves (14) . We also documented prominent apoptosis of T effector cells in vivo in a mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, cytokine deprivation-induced apoptosis is a key mechanism by which Treg cells suppress effector T cell responses. Further work will address the physiological role of interactions between various T cell subsets, especially Treg and T H 17 cells. Nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB is defective in caspase-8 deficiency syndrome (CEDS). Confocal microscopy photomicrographs of peripheral blood lymphocytes from a normal control (N), the unaffected mother (M) and two affected siblings (P1 and P2) with either no stimulation (none) or following stimulation with 1 mcg per ml anti-CD3 and anti-28 for four hours and then cell preparations were stained for the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB (green) and Hoeschst dye for nuclear DNA (red). There is coincidence of the stains (yellow) cells when NF-\u03baB has translocated into the nucleus, but no coincidence of stains when nuclear translocation is defective.",
