Such huge change ended by establishing clinical pharmacy practice during the period of 1960s and 1970s and led later on to founding pharmaceutical care (Elenbaas & Worthen, 2009 ). The new trend of practice, which was started early in the United States and transferred to other countries, represents a way of practice dominating worldwide. Since then, pharmacists became the main source of information on medicines and gained the appreciation and respect of the healthcare team members everywhere in the world. Information on medicines is provided by individual pharmacists during medical rounds and scientific meetings such as conferences, workshops, and seminars or within official bodies such as medicines information centers and hospital committees. Trust and appreciation extended to the general public because of pharmacists' contribution to the awareness campaigns, patients counseling, pharmacists-run clinics, and participation in wellness programs.",

Published research papers are called primary literature because they are the primary source of newly discovered and recently revealed information that is established from research and investigations before such information becomes well known and later on all other sources of information are built based on them. Previously, all journals are published as printed material. Nowadays, journals are published as print and as online digital copies, and some journals are online-only. This has increased accessibility of the journal materials to the readers. In terms of accessibility, journals are either subscription based (i.e., users' payments) or freely accessed (i.e., publication fees are paid by the individual researchers or their institutions). When we describe the availability of biomedical journals in a particular institution, we mean their availability within the library databases of that institution, which requires the subscription of such institution with the database that includes the required journals. If a journal is available free to the readers, then there is no problem with accessibility to its content and the content can be downloaded and easily used by anyone. However, with subscription-only journals' content, there may be a problem in the accessibility to such information among pharmacists in the poorest developing countries (i.e., lowto middle-income countries).",

However, a major limitation of textbooks and books is that some included details must be updated from other resources depending on the nature of the information and on how progressive the research in the particular scientific field is. This is like statistics on the epidemiology of a fast-spreading disease. On average, for a book to be written and published, it requires a period ranges from 3 to 5 years. If some references included in a book at the book preparation time were 5 years back, then such information will be about 10 years backdated when the book becomes firstly available in the market. In our rapidly changing world today, 10 years-back information might be totally obsolete. A study conducted by Novo Nordisk Inc. to assess the accuracy of information about Novo Nordisk products in 37 common drug and medical references identified some errors in such references including outdated product information (Lum & Ahn, 2012) .",

In Jordan, a study conducted by Wazaify, Maani, and Ball (2009) reported that all private community pharmacies had at least one reference book, but most were outdated. In Singapore, reference texts are still trusted by pharmacists (Wong, Ko, & Sklar, 2009) . Even in the United States, a survey performed among Alabama pharmacy facilities indicated a high use of textbooks as medicine information resources such as Drug Facts and Comparisons and Physician's Desk Reference (Schrimsher, Freeman, & Kendrach, 2006) . Clauson, Fass, and Seamon (2008a) explored the legal requirements for maintaining medicines information resources in pharmacies across the 50 states in the United States and found that two states, Minnesota and South Dakota (3.8% of states), required print references. The availability of digital copies of textbooks, books, and monographs has increased the availability and the wide usage of such resources since they are portable and they are convenient while used (Hughes, Kendrach, Schrimsher, Wensel, & Freeman, 2011) .",

MICs are commonly localized or affiliated to hospitals, academic institutions, Ministries of Health, medicines manufacturers, health professional associations, and community pharmacies. In hospitals, which are the primary setting of MIC, if no center exists, there should be at least a medicines information service provided by pharmacy department, individual clinical pharmacists, or ordinary pharmacists. Sometimes, an MIC serves the poison information needs of its users and it may be referred to as a medicines and poisons information center. In some situations, there is a need for a regional MIC that covers with its services a large region or a state from a country. This is particularly needed in the poorest countries and it should be encouraged to overcome problems of shortage in infrastructures, facilities, funding, qualified personnel, and other resources.",

Among main findings were the quantity and type of questions received and the categories of users remained relatively constant during a period of 6 years. Most of the requests were directly related to patient care and they came within the university hospital. The use of textbooks as sources for answering questions was the most common practice during the first years of the unit start and it became less common during the subsequent years. This was associated with a gradually increased use of MICROMEDEX drug database, which became the most consulted source of information at the end of the studied period. 6. A study was performed to identify the characteristics of the medicines information provided by an MIC of a university hospital in Brazil (Silva et al., 2011 available only as an abstract). There was a variation in the rate and nature of the received inquiries and in the categories of requesters during a period of only 2 years. 7. An assessment of medicines information services provided by pharmacy practice department in Kasturba Hospital, Manipal, a South Indian teaching hospital, was made (George & Rao, 2005) . Evaluation included the nature of queries and the quality of the provided services. The majority of the service users were physicians (82%) and medical postgraduate students (16%). Feedback from users indicated their regular use and their high satisfaction with the services provided. 8. After promoting the services of the MIC of Karnataka State Pharmacy Council, India, to healthcare professionals and patients, a dramatic increase in the number of queries received by the center was eminent (Lakshmi, Rao, Gore, & Bhaskaran, 2003) . Pediatricians, general physicians, dermatologists, and gynecologists constituted the bulk of the doctors using the center services. Queries received from doctors represented 41.3% after the promotion of the service, while they represented only 13.2% at the beginning. Other requests were from patients, pharmacists, and drug regulatory authorities (Table 22 .1).",

Securing enough funding for establishing and running an MIC in the poorest countries represents a great challenge: A developing country with very limited financial resources will not be able to establish and then run an MIC easily. Even if establishment is achieved via donations or other sources, running the center will not be easily achieved without proper solutions. One of the strategies that should be followed is to build up one regional center instead of establishing a couple of centers that grow weak and become unable to survive. Then the limited scarce resources can be saved to strengthen the center and ensure sustainability of its services. One of the possible solutions is to implement a fee-for-service policy. Several Western countries are having an experience in this regard. A survey sent to medicines information centers in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States revealed that 18% of the centers use a fee-for-service system (Ansong, Moody, & Stachnik, 2003) . For a developing country, the payers can be the private sector and the industry, which will be willing to pay if their information needs are secured by the medicines information service provider 2. The full access to biomedical literature in the poorest countries: The full access to biomedical literature in the poorest countries where basic resources and infrastructures are lacking represents a challenge to the practicing pharmacists in general and to the medicines information specialists in particular. Pharmacists in such countries are advised to seek access to the required medicines information via registering with WHO's Hinari program. 3. Provision of medicines information about off-label use of medicines: \"Off-label medicines use\" refers to using a medication for an indication or in a dosage form or for a group of patients, which is not indicated when approved by the regulatory authority. It is very common practice worldwide and it may be unavoidable with a rate reaching 15% to 20% in western settings. It is most common among the groups of patients who are not normally included in the clinical trials that are conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the medications. Those groups included pediatric patients, particularly neonates, adolescents, pregnant women, and psychiatric patients. There is a lack of evidence-based information on the efficacy and safety of a particular medication among the stated groups, and possible information available represents an extrapolation of the evidence generated from research conducted among other groups of patients. Manufacturers' sources of information can be useful in these situations, although such information should be used cautiously.",

In such situation a medicines information pharmacist or an MIC is expected to provide the suitable support to the healthcare team and the attacked victims in a timely and an efficient manner. 5. Provision of medicines information during a pandemic: A pandemic is an epidemic of infectious diseases, such as H5N1 avian flu, Zika virus, Ebola virus disease, Rift Valley fever, and severe acute respiratory syndrome, which have spread through human populations across a large geographical areas including multiple continents or even worldwide. During such situations, a medicines information pharmacist or an MIC experiences a rush of high-frequency calls from healthcare providers asking for treatment information, especially at the beginning of an outbreak when healthcare providers are still not fully aware and may be lacking basic information about the disease.",

Different institutions within the same country can work on establishing an information sharing system to facilitate information exchange and building up huge medicines information databases. 3. Collaboration among countries from the same region provides great opportunities to save resources and strengthening the capacities for attaining sustainable high-quality services. This can be achieved via sharing available experiences and resources and can be maximized by building collaborative regional MICs. 4. Institutions from developing countries with no or limited access to high-quality medicines information resources should seek assistance from supportive organizations such as the WHO, which can offer free access to the Hinari database. Other freely available resources should be also sought. 5. Medicines information education should be promoted among colleges of pharmacy at various levels including didactic courses during undergraduate studies, during APPE training of PharmD students and as postgraduate studies and training (i.e., residencies, fellowships, and masters programs). 6. Training for developing and strengthening the medicines information skills should be provided regularly to all practicing pharmacists as part of the continuing professional development (CPD) programs 7. Advanced training can be scheduled for pharmacists working on the provision of medicines information services as part of CPD activities to build their capacities and to raise their competencies. 8. Countries with limited experiences in the area of medicines information should work on to learn from countries having well-established systems of medicines information and try to copy successful innovations. 9. There is a need to monitor and evaluate various resources of medicines information available in the developing countries as well as evaluating the services provided by the medicines information centers. This is very useful for improvement and for the expansion and the sustainability of the services. Evaluations are done by conducting scientific research studies. Such researches should be published to allow others make use of the established evidence.",

The information will be used to build pharmacists own competencies to practice efficiently and ethically and to provide high-quality services. The quality of information can be measured in terms of satisfying certain standard criteria and in terms of satisfying the needs of the information user. Being aware of the information needs of the healthcare professionals is helpful in offering the required assistance that is tailored to the users' needs. The availability of a medicine information resource does not indicate the usage or the usefulness of such resource. The accessibility and the quality of information are having great effects on the use and the full utilization of such resource. Securing enough funding for establishing and running an MIC in the poorest countries represents a great challenge. Education on medicines information should be well established in the curricula of pharmacy colleges to prepare future pharmacists with the required knowledge and skills needed for good practicing.",
