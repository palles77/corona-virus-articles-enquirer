These cytokines orchestrate the elimination of the viruses but are occasionally detrimental to the hosts. The outcomes and pathogenesis of viral infection are largely determined by the specific interaction between the viruses and their host cells. Therefore, compounds that either inhibit viral infection or modulate virus-induced cytokine response should be considered as candidates for managing virus infection. The aim of the study was to identify compounds in both categories, using a single cellbased assay. Our screening platform is a HEK293 cell-based reporter assay where the expression of a firefly luciferase is under the control of a human IFN-\u03b2 promoter. We have demonstrated that infection of the reporter cell line with a panel of RNA viruses activated the reporter gene expression that correlates quantitatively with the levels of virus replication and progeny virus production, and could be inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by known antiviral compound or inhibitors of PRR signal transduction pathways. Using Dengue virus as an example, a pilot screening of a small molecule library consisting of 26,900 compounds proved the concept that the IFN-\u03b2 promoter reporter assay can serve as a convenient high throughput screening platform for simultaneous discovery of antiviral and innate immune response modulating compounds. A representative antiviral compound from the pilot screening, 1-(6-ethoxybenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-",

While significant progress has been made during the last two decades in the development and clinical application of antiviral drugs against several medically important viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Fung et al., 2011; Jilek et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2011) , antivirals against many RNA viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers and respiratory tract diseases are either limited in efficacy or not yet available . To fulfill this unmet medical need, we intended to develop convenient assays for high-throughput discovery of compounds that either inhibit the replication of the viruses or alleviate their pathogenesis, which are usually resulted from uncontrolled cytokine response to viral infection and sometime life-threaten.",

            "text": "To achieve this goal, we have designed and implemented a cell-based high throughput assay that can be applied to many types of viruses and is suitable for simultaneous identification of compounds that either inhibit viral replication or modulate virus-induced cytokine response. The principle of the assay is based on the innate immune recognition of virus infection by host innate pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors, C-type lectins and many others (Takeuchi and Akira, 2010) . Activation of PRRs by molecular patterns of viruses, such as viral nucleic acids, oligomers of envelope proteins and nucleocapsids, induces cellular responses leading to production of type I interferons (IFN), proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Takeuchi and Akira, 2008; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010) . Because activation of IFN response is a common feature of many different viruses, we established a HEK293 cell-based reporter system where expression of a firefly luciferase gene is under the control of human IFN-\u03b2 promoter to quantitatively monitor the virus activated host innate immune response. Specifically, the stable cell line used in this study, 293TLR3/IFN\u03b2Luc, has intrinsic RLR pathway and a reconstituted TLR3 pathway, which are primary PRRs for many RNA viruses Loo and Gale, 2011; Negishi et al., 2008) , and therefore should be responsive to the infection of these viruses.",

Interestingly, because the levels of reporter gene expression upon the virus infection were quantitatively correlated with the levels of virus replication and progeny virion production, we have thus speculated and subsequently demonstrated that the level of luciferase expression in virally infected cells can serve as a simple and quantitative readout of viral replication activity in a high throughput manner. As we anticipated, a pilot screening of 26,900 compounds convincingly demonstrated that the IFN-\u03b2 promoter reporter assay can be used as a broadly applicable platform for discovery of compounds with antiviral activity against many different viruses as well as compounds that inhibit virus-induced cytokine response. A representative antiviral compound from the pilot screening, 1-(6ethoxybenzo[d]thiazol-2-yl)-3-(3-methoxyphenyl) urea, was characterized in detail and demonstrated to specifically inhibit several viruses belonging to the family of flaviviridae.",

However, as expected, IFN-\u03b1 efficiently inhibited HCV replication under both conditions. Furthermore, BPU did not inhibit the replication of HCV subgenomic replicon in Huh7 cells (Fig. 8E) . These results thus implied that BPU most likely inhibited an early or late event of HCV replication, such as entry and uncoating or virion particle assembly and secretion, but not viral protein biosynthesis/processing and RNA replication. To distinguish these two possibilities, we further demonstrated that BPU selectively inhibited the infection of HCV envelope proteins E1 and E2-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (HCVpp), but not VSV G protein-pseudotyped lentiviral particles (VSVpp).

It allows the screening to be performed with a low MOI (0.1) of infection ( Fig. 4 and Table 2 ), which supports multiple rounds of viral infection and thus allows for the identification of compounds that inhibit any step of viral replication cycle. On the contrary, many other commonly used cell-based antiviral assays, such as those based on virus induced cytopathic effect (CPE), frequently require high MOI of infection, which may preclude the identification of compounds targeting late events of viral replication cycle. In addition, although in the current study the screen was performed in 96-well plate, the assay can be easily miniaturized into 384-well format and adapted to using of liquid handling.",

            "text": "Second, in addition to identify compounds with antiviral activity, the IFN-\u03b2 reporter assay can also be used for simultaneously identification of compounds that inhibit virus-elicited proinflammatory cytokine response. This is because the activation of IFN-\u03b2 gene expression relies on coordinative activation of IRF3/IRF7, NF\u03baB and MAPK pathways, and the later two pathways are also required to induce other inflammatory cytokines, therefore, monitoring the IFN-\u03b2 gene activation by viral infections should cover the most, if not all, important innate immune signaling pathways. Although it was not a focus of the current study, we have demonstrated that the virus activated IFN-\u03b2 promoter activity can be dosedependently inhibited by multiple known inhibitors of these pathways ( (Guo et al., 2012) and data not shown). In fact, our pilot screening has indeed identified multiple compounds with such properties (Fig. 5) . The compounds that inhibit viral induction of cytokine response could be candidates for the development of drugs that alleviate viral pathogenesis related to \"cytokine storm\", such as encephalomeningitis in West Nile virus infection (Wang et al., 2004) , hemorrhagic fevers in the infection of DENV, Ebola virus and many other viruses (Paessler and Walker, 2012; Pang, Cardosa, and Guzman, 2007; Wauquier et al., 2010) as well as severe pneumonia in influenza A virus or SARS-coronavirus infection (Cheng et al., 2011; Oslund and Baumgarth, 2011; Theron et al., 2005) . Alternatively, these compounds could also serve as chemical genetic probes for studying virus-host interaction.",

Because activation of the IFN response is a common property of many different viruses, the assay can serve as a broadly applicable HTS platform for any virus that can infect the cells.

In fact, such a multiplex viral screening should reveal virus-specific and broad-spectrum antiviral compounds as well as compounds disrupting virus-specific or common innate immune response pathways. The information obtained from the multiplex viral screening will help prioritize the active compounds for further development as therapeutics and/or molecular probes. For instance, the compounds that hit the common \"choke\" points of host functions required for replication of many different viruses can potentially serve as candidates for development of broadspectrum antiviral drugs, or experimental probes to reveal the commonly required host functions for viral replication or induction of host antiviral response (Ma-Lauer et al., 2012) .",

Mechanistic analysis further demonstrated that the compound inhibited the entry of HCV, and possibly other flaviviruses, by targeting common entry factor(s) shared by these viruses. Chemically, BPU has an N-benzothiazolyl N'-phenyl urea core structure with two alkoxy substitutions (Fig. 6A ).

(C) Representative image from four independent experiments to determine anti-DENV activity of BPU by In-cell western assay. Huh7.5 cells grown in 96-well plate were either mock infected or infected with DENV at MOI of 0.1, and mock treated or treated with indicated concentration of BPU for 48 h. DENV envelop (E) protein expression was revealed by In-cell immunostaining (green). Cell viabilities were determined by DRAQ 5 and Sapphire 700 staining (red). (D) Quantification of DENV E and cell stain in In-cell western assay using LI-COR Odyssey. Fluorescent intensity data were expressed as percentage of mock treated controls.",
