The median lethal concentration (96 h) of CQ was 31.62 mg/ml. During acute treatment (CQ at 31.62 mg/ml) the treated fish groups showed a significant increase in GOT and GPT activities in blood plasma; whereas LDH activity was decreased when compare to control groups. To analyse the effects of drug at the lowest concentration, the fish were exposed to 3.16 mg/ml (1/10th of 96 h LC50 value) for 96 h. In sublethal treatment (3.16 mg/ml) GOT activity increased up to 14th day and decreased during the rest of the exposure period (21, 28 and 35th day). A biphasic response in GPT activity was observed. LDH activity was found to be increased throughout the study period (35 days) compare to control groups. The alterations in enzyme activities in blood plasma were found to be significant at p < 0.05 (DMRT). Many histopathological changes in vital organs such as gill, liver and kidney of fish were observed in CQ treated group (acute and sub-lethal) compare to normal group. The alterations in the enzymological and histopathological study in the present investigation indicate that the drug CQ has toxic effects on non-target organisms. We conclude that the alterations in enzymological parameters and histopathological changes can be used as biomarker to assess the health of the aquatic organism/environment. Further data on molecular studies are needed to define the mode of action and toxicity of these emerging pollutants.",

CQ has been used as a primary antimalarial drug since 1930s due to its tolerability, effectiveness against malaria and inexpensive synthesis [2] . In addition to serving as a malarial drug, CQ is now used in cancer therapy due to its enhancement property against tumour activity [3] . CQ is also shown to significantly improve insulin levels in type 2 diabetes (T2D) [4] . In addition CQ is used as an antifungal [5] , it is used in the treatment of rheumatic and immune-mediated diseases [6] , management of HIV, SARS-CoV and influenza A/H5N1 virus [7] .",

In addition, CQ treatment during pregnancy is extremely toxic to embryo and overdose could lead to death [8] . The negative effect of CQ is due to the fact that it inhibits diastolic depolarization, which slows down conduction and alters the intracellular transport of ionic transport. It also inhibits glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase activity, enzyme synthesis in nucleic acids; cyclic AMP pathway and it also increase oxidative stress in the organs [1, 9] .

Bioassays play an important role in providing information about the impact of emerging chemicals [17] . In addition to bioassay, biomarkers are considered as early warning signals in the field of environment risk assessment. The biomarker response reveals the health status of an organism, population and ecosystem [18] .

Glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT or AST), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (GPT or ALT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are the enzymes found in heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscles and erythrocytes. GOT and GPT participate in transamination reactions. Likewise, LDH is an oxidative enzyme which is important for glycolytic activity. The alterations in these enzymes are used as organ health indicators of chemical exposure. GOT, GPT and LDH are widely used enzymological parameters in toxicology and in clinical chemistry to know the status of organs [21] . Similarly, histopathological changes provide the direct effects of the toxicant in organs [22] and also reveal the difference between damage induced by toxicant and other factors in organs/tissues [23] . In fish, gills are the primary site of toxicant exposure and their structural changes indicate the impact of toxicant. Liver is the second largest organ in the body and are known to be a defense organ. Antoine et al. [24] reported that liver is the major target area of human pharmaceuticals. Likewise kidney is a target organ for many pharmaceutical drugs. Hence, histological observation of vital organs such as gill, liver and kidney are important biomarkers in determining the toxic effect of human pharmaceuticals.",

Four-day acute static toxicity tests were performed to determine the median lethal concentration of CQ on C. carpio. Two plastic tubs (20L water capacity each) were taken and 8L of water was added to each tub. Fingerlings from the stock were randomly collected and 4 fish was introduced in each tub. A known concentration of CQ was added to each tub. Two tubs are separated and marked as control (not treated with CQ). At the end of every 12 h the numbers of dead and alive fingerlings were noted up to 96 h. The dead fingerlings were removed instantly. The concentration of the CQ in each test was calculated based upon the result obtained in the previous test. Finally a conformation test will be carried out after obtaining the LC50. In the conformation test 10 fingerlings from stock were introduced into tub (50 L water capacity) with 20 L of water. At the same time the control group was also maintained. The LC50 of CQ on C. carpio was calculated by the probit analysis method [26] and noted as 31.62 mg/L. During the test behavioural changes and signs were closely followed up. Homogenicity of the population in the study was calculated by using chi-square test (Table S1 ).",

In this line sub lethal toxicity test are important management tool to measure the long term effect of toxicants at low concentration of chemical. Acute toxicity studies of pharmaceuticals are predominant than the long term toxicity test. Acute toxicity data will be useful only when there will be accidental discharge of drugs [37] , in which there will be no mortality in the organism but morphological, behavioural and metabolic alterations could occur. The data on acute toxicity of chloroquine to aquatic organisms are very limited. Zurita et al. [38] reported that the 48 h median effective concentration (EC50) of CQ to Daphnia magna, Chlorella vulgaris, fish cells from Poeciliopsis lucida and the bacterium Vibrio fischeri was 9, 27, 43 and 126 mg/L respectively. Similarly Rendal et al. [39] reported that the toxicity of CQ to Salix viminalis and Daphnia magna was more at pH 9 than at pH 6 indicating that the toxicity of CQ depends on the pH of the media. In the present study the 96 h LC 50 of CQ to C. carpio was found to be 31.32 mg/ml. Our result more or less similar to reports reported on the LC 50 of other pharmaceutical drugs such as sulfadimethoxine, carbamazepine, propranolol, ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, levofloxacin, triclosan to O. latipes was > 100, 35.4, 11.40, > 100, 8 .04, > 100 and 0.60 mg/l, respectively [40, 41] . Similarly, Henschel et al. [42] reported the LC 50 of paracetamol to B. rerio was 378 mg/l and clofibric acid to D. rerio was 86 mg/l. In many aquaculture farms CQ is administrated with a dose of 10-20 mg/L as a safe dose [43] . In the present study the mortality of fish exposed to CQ at higher concentrations may be due to inhibition of various metabolic functions caused by CQ. CQ binds with DNA and inhibits the metabolic functions, interfere with haemoglobin and it also causes cell mediated death [6] . Similar to our findings MacPhee and Ruelle [44] observed mortality of fish salmon upon exposure to 20 \u03bcM of CQ, whereas only behavioural changes were noticed in rainbow trout exposed to 388 \u03bcM of CQ after 24 h [45] . To analyse the impact of CQ at lower concentration in the present investigation 1/10th value of 96 h LC 50 value (3.16 mg/ml) was taken.",

            "text": "GOT and GPT are the liver guiding enzymes and function as catalyse in transfering amino groups to alpha-keto acids and aspartic acid to \u03b1ketoglutaric acid in interconversion of carbohydrate and protein. In the present investigation GOT, GPT and LDH activity in plasma of fish was altered during acute and sublethal exposure. Van der et al. [46] stated that changes in the activity of plasma GOT and GPT act as a sensitive indicator to know the health status of organs of fish exposed to chemicals. Decrease in transaminase activity was due to the deficiency of amino acids and reduction of \u03b1-ketoglutaric acid. When there is minor cell damage, the enzyme activity may increase in the blood (extracellular fluid) [21] . Increase in plasma GOT and GPT activity is an indication of functional damage of muscular, hepatic, and renal cell damage. However, GOT and GPT levels in an organism is depends on the protein and carbohydrate metabolism [47] . Any changes in the protein and carbohydrate metabolism may also leads to a change in the transaminase activity. In the present study also the accumulation of CQ in tissues/organs leads to damage of these organs which results release of these enzymes in to blood. In general an increase in transaminases activity indicates tissue damage whereas the inhibition of these enzymes indicates disturbance in the structure of cell organelles or death of cell organelles. The inhibition of lysosomal functions in PLHC-1 cell lines may be due to selective accumulation of CQ in the lysosomes [38] . Tetrameric enzyme, LDH is located in the cytoplasm and plays an important role in the energy metabolism under oxygen demand. Alteration in LDH activity indicates the release of isozymes from damaged cells, changes in protein and carbohydrate metabolism and leakage from white muscle and red blood cells [47, 46] . Furthermore changes in the activity of LDH could be used as a good marker of membrane permeability and apoptosis [48] . In the present study the significant increase in LDH activity during acute study indicate impaired carbohydrate metabolism caused by the drug chloroquine. However, the observed increase of LDH activity during sublethal treatment might have resulted from tissue damage due to accumulation and toxicity of CQ. In the present study, the alterations in the GOT, GPT and LDH activities clearly indicate that the fish is under stress condition. Alterations in GOT,GPT and LDH activity has been reported in L. rohita exposed to selenium [21] , D. magna exposed to carbamazepine [48] , C. carpio exposed to clofibric acid and diclofenac [49] and in C. mrigala exposed to ibuprofen [50] . The alteration in these enzyme activities are generally used as sensitive biomarkers for the monitoring of xenobiotics in the aquatic environment. Zurita et al. [38] reported a dose dependent inhibition of total protein content and significant increase in SOD and G6PDH activities in PLHC-1 cells due to CQ toxicity. In the present study also the alterations of the GOT, GPT and LDH activities during acute and sublethal toxicity depends on the dose and exposure period.",

In the present study during acute and sublethal CQ exposed group certain structural anomalies such as ND, V, CE, ISS, N and AH were noted. A similar structural alteration in the liver of fish exposed to various chemicals has been reported; Bucher and Hofer [61] in Salmo trutta, Capkin et al. [62] and Uguz et al. [63] in Oncorhynchus mykiss, Miranda et al. [64] in Hoplias malabaricus and Ahmed et al. [60] in Oreochromis mossambicus. Jarrar and Taib [65] reported that nuclear degeneration, cellular oedema, necrosis and alteration of hepatocytes are the indication of the hyperactivity of nucleus and severe and irreversible damage of liver. Vacuolation could occur as a result of anoxia, irregular synthesis of parenchymal cell substances, defence mechanism and various biochemical alterations such as inhibition of protein synthesis and ionic regulation, denaturation of enzymes, energy depletion, disaggregation of microtubules, or shifts in substrate utilization in the liver [66] . The histological alterations occurred in the liver of fish exposed to CQ treatment could result in several abnormal metabolic action which may leads to failure of other organs also. A reduction in cell number, hydropic degeneration of the cytoplasm and pyknotic nuclei has been reported in PLHC-1 cells due to CQ toxicity [38] .",

Renal histology is a powerful parameter in assessing the effect of chemicals in the organism. According to Ortiz et al. [67] kidney could be used as a good indicator in toxicology research because it is the organ which receives high of post-brachial blood. In the present study the fish in control groups showed a regular shape of BC, RT, EC, HT and G in their kidney structure. Structural anomalies such as TBC, TCN, SG, TD, GN, HDD, CS, CRP, RL and RTS were observed in the kidney of fish exposed to CQ. Similar result was found by Veiga et al. [68] in Prochilodus lineatus, Pacheco and Santos [69] in Anguilla anguilla, Capkin et al. [62] in Oncorhynchus mykiss, Das and Mukherjee [70] in Labeo rohita, Gill et al. [71] in Puntius conchonius and Cengiz [72] Cyprinus carpio exposed to various chemicals. Tubular, granular and hyaline droplet degeneration and necrosis are the common structural changes that occur in the presence of toxic substance in the kidney [73] . Rand [74] reported that the accumulation of irregular size of eosinophilic granules, degradation of hyaline droplet in the cytoplasm causes necrosis. Cloudy swelling could be occurring in the fish exposed to toxic substance by the hypertrophy and fine granules in cytoplasm. Flow of blood through the kidney is higher than other organs of the body; Bowman's capsule in the kidney often gets pathological effects due to presence of chemicals in the blood [75] . The structural changes occurred in the kidney of fish exposed to CQ treatment indicates the functional impairment, which could alter the metabolic mechanisms of the fish.",

The observed enzymological and histological alterations during acute toxicity may be due to high dose of the CQ, whereas the alterations during sublethal treatment indicates that CQ may remains active in aquariums and cause adverse effects. The alterations in the enzymological and histopathological parameters can be used as ideal biomarker in aquatic toxicology. Furthermore, the enzymological and histological alterations are very much essential to precede further toxicity study for the better define about the pharmaceuticals toxicity in aquatic organisms.",
