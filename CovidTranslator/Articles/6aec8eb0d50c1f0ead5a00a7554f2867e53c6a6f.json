Over two thirds were either \"not concerned\" or \"slightly concerned\" about contracting MERS-CoV; believing that they were under Allah's (God's) protection (40%) was the most cited reason. While 79% were aware that the disease can transmit through droplet from infected person, only 12% stated that MERS-CoV transmits via camels; people in Saudi Arabia were better aware of the transmission. Nevertheless, only 22% of respondents believed that camels are the zoonotic reservoir of MERS-CoV. Those who were concerned about contracting MERS-CoV (aOR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.1, p < 0.01) and those who thought MERS-CoV to be a severe disease only for those with high-risk conditions (aOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.1, p < 0.01) were more likely to believe that camels are the zoonotic source. However, residents of KSA (aOR: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01-0.07, p < 0.01), UAE (aOR: 0.01, 95% CI: 0.004-0.02, p < 0.01) and Kuwait (aOR: 0.03, 95% CI: 0.01-0.07, p < 0.01) were less likely to believe that camels are the main zoonotic source compared to respondents from the other countries. Hygienic measures were more commonly adopted than avoidance of camels or their raw products, yet there was a discrepancy between the countries.",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a severe respiratory infection which has infected over 1888 people in 27 countries [1] . Since its first discovery in Saudi Arabia in 2012 [2] , MERS-CoV has spread to neighboring Gulf countries (Table 1) and reached as far as South East Asia, Europe and North America. Arabian Gulf countries bear the heaviest burden of the epidemic and with 1549 cases and 643 fatalities, Saudi Arabia is considered the epicentre of MERS-CoV [3] . To date, camels are considered to be the zoonotic source of the virus [4] . Recent data obtained from Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MoH) showed that about 41% of the MERS-CoV patients had a history of exposure to camels [5] . This epidemic poses great public health challenge to the Middle East particularly in view of the fact that the region traditionally hosts large gatherings such as Hajj pilgrimage. In order to limit the spread of the epidemic, many important strategies have been introduced from international public health agencies including the World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These recommendations include facemask use, hand hygiene, cough etiquette, and avoidance of close contact with camels and consumption of their raw products [6, 7] , needing public participation and subsequent investigation to quantify their uptake and effects. Few studies have attempted to examine the knowledge and practices around MERS-CoV among members of the public and health care workers (HCWs) and that is only in Saudi Arabia, the hotspot of MERS-CoV [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, no study has compared public understanding and behaviors around MERS-CoV across the Gulf countries. Also, no study has explored knowledge and practices about the risk of camel exposure among the general public. Such data are required for transnational comparisons, designing mitigation plans, research and sharing accountability across the countries. Moreover, it can also provide lessons for the future in relation to public willingness to adopt prevention behaviors and support related policies against emerging diseases. To this end, we have conducted a cross-sectional study to examine public awareness about MERS-CoV and compare public adoption of preventive practices including non-pharmaceutical behaviors (e.g. hand hygiene) and exposure to camels in response to the epidemic MERS-CoV among residents of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.",

The GI is a smartphone app that was published in apple app store in November 2014, to be used as a research data collection platform for cross-sectional and cohort studies targeting users from the GCC countries. This survey was published on the GI platform from July to November 2015. Registered participants who have the app installed on their smartphone devices (voluntarily) received push-notifications (short messages [SMS]-like function) from the app inviting them to open the app and participate in the study, and also reminders were sent to those who did not complete the survey questions [12] . The app has 'built-in' location verification function to guarantee that only users from targeted countries are allowed to register. Each user has a unique device identifier linked to the research database so the user cannot submit any information more than once, and allow anonymous data collection. This method was tested successfully in previous studies [13] [14] [15] .",

However, participants' specific knowledge about the mode of transmission was lower and differed depending on the modalities of transmission; for example, overall 79% participants knew that MERS-CoV transmits through coughing or sneezing (i.e., through large droplets) which is comparable to 72%-91% Saudi public knowing that coughing or sneezing spread MERS-CoV [8, 9, 16] . Conversely, this survey shows that only 21% of participants (24% of Saudi Arabian respondents) believed that MERS-CoV transmits through close contact with infected person, which is comparable to 31% Saudi citizens believing so, but much lower compared to another study which demonstrated that >70% Saudi people considered MERS-CoV to spread from person to person via close contact such as shaking hands with an infected person [8, 9] , but without sustained community transmission [8] ; this difference may suggest that in-depth knowledge of MERS-CoV transmission is very much individual, and people build on learning about this from their background knowledge and life experiences. For example, surveys involving healthcare workers have shown that 64% of dental students and 88% of hospital HCWs were aware that MERS-CoV can transmit through close contact like caring for and/or living in the same house with infected persons, indicating that persons with better understanding of the disease were more aware of its transmission [10, 11] .",

Only 12% respondents said that MERS-CoV can be acquired by coming in direct contact with infected camels yet 56% participants avoided camel contact. On the contrary, respectively 18% and 62% believed that it can be acquired by consuming raw milk and meat, yet only 22% respondents believed camels to be a zoonotic reservoir, and up to 28% participants avoided raw camel products. This observation remains difficult to explain fully, however other surveys involving Saudi public and trainee HCWs have shown that about 50% respondents believed camels to be the source of MERS-CoV [8, 9, 11] . From the example of avoiding camel contact, a unique observation was that there was an upward transition from peoples' awareness to action. This finding can be explained by 'precaution adoption process model' (Fig. 1) . The framework of this model sets forward stages of health behavior change in an individual and the factors that lead people to move from one stage to another such as beliefs, perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived barriers, motivation, and cues to action [23] . Paradoxically, however, more respondents (56%) avoided camels while only a small proportion (12%) was aware of the acquisition of MERS-CoV from camels. This is likely because, contact with camel or consumption of its raw products (milk, liver, meat, and urine) is associated with other exotic infections such as brucellosis, plague, and rift valley fever [24] [25] [26] , so some respondents may have avoided exposure to camel to prevent other non-MERS diseases.",

The use of facemask varies widely: a recent survey conducted in Riyadh reported that 75% participants used facemask in crowded places while a country-wide survey demonstrated that 11% used facemasks in public places [8, 9] .

Smartphones are increasingly becoming an essential part of modern life, for example in Saudi Arabia about 70% of mobile users own smartphones [30] . A few studies have demonstrated the usefulness of using electronic surveys, including by using mobile devices, in conducting surveys with promising results [31] [32] [33] [34] . For instance, in a comparative study of pen and paper survey versus smart phone data collection, Zhang et al. [32] demonstrated that much data recording and entry errors were prevented in smart phone surveys (while in pen-paper based surveys 65% of the data did not match and needed to be rechecked subsequently). Our team have also successfully tested this method in tracking Hajj pilgrims' health behaviors in 2014 [35] . This study shows that using smartphones allows fast communication with target population, saves time and effort, and is cheap. However, using smartphones in social and epidemiological research works has not yet gained much popularity and deserves further evaluation to confirm its effectiveness.",
