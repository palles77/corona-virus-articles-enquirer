            "text": "SARS originated in November 2002 in the Guangdong Province of China, and by February 2003, had spread to Hong Kong and subsequently to 32 other countries or regions, infecting 8096 patients and resulting in 774 deaths. 2, 3 SARS is unique in several aspects. SARS was the first emerging infectious disease for which WHO issued a global alert, on March 12, 2003 . It illustrated dramatically the potential of air travel and globalization for the dissemination of an emerging infectious disease. The concentration of cases in previously healthy adults and the proportion of patients requiring intensive care was particularly alarming. [4] [5] [6] [7] SARS caused morbidity and mortality in healthcare workers (HCWs) and intrahospital transmission amplified regional outbreaks and augmented spread of the illness into the community. 2, 3 All added a tremendous burden to healthcare systems in the absence of natural disaster or war. The cost of SARS was substantial: a 4% drop in GDP in Hong Kong (> 6 billion US dollars) was estimated by the Asian Development Bank. 8 From SARS, we know that an infectious disease in one country is a threat to all. An infectious disease outbreak reveals weaknesses in the public health infrastructure. Emerging infectious diseases can be contained with a high level of government commitment and international collaboration. 1, 9, 10 Multidisciplinary approaches and cooperation from veterinary, medical, public health, epidemiology, microbiology and immunology communities are important for the protection of everyone. In our ever-shrinking world, widespread media coverage of infections-ranging from SARS and influenza in Asia to acute gastroenteritis due to norovirus on cruise ships in Europe and the outbreak due to Escherichia coli 0157 in the United States-has raised public interest in contagious diseases to new heights. 11 Recent experiences with the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 have given the world its first advance warning that another influenza pandemic may be imminent. 1, 12, 13 To prevent the potential serious consequences of a pandemic, timely implementation of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions locally within the outbreak area is the key to minimizing global spread. 12, 14 As air travel and global trade are now commonplace and have facilitated the international spread of emerging infectious diseases within a very short period of time, a review of the lessons learned from the latest outbreak of SARS is important.",

            "text": "SARS is a zoonotic disease caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 2, 9, 15, 16 SARS-CoV evolved consistently and rapidly within its animal and human hosts, while both the infectivity of the virus and the severity of the disease varied, along with the variation/adaptation of the virus to its hosts. 16 Transmissibility refers to the capacity of an infectious agent to spread from one person to another, and risk of infection depends on the conditions of exposure. 17 Lipsitch et al 18 and Riley et al 19 calculated that the basic case reproduction number (R 0 )-the fundamental epidemiologic quantity that determines the potential for disease spread-is of the order of 2-4 (excluding superspreading events). Both studies suggested that an achievable combination of control measures, including hand washing, the use of an appropriate and well-fitted facemask, isolation of SARS cases, enhanced surveillance and effective contact tracing and quarantine of asymptomatic contacts (shortening the time from symptom onset to isolation of patients), can be effective in containing SARS, as mentioned previously. 7, 20 Transmission rates fell during the epidemic: R 0 fell from a mean of 7 in the first week of the Singapore outbreak to a mean of 1.6 in the second week, to a mean below 1 in most weeks thereafter. 18 Molecular epidemiologic studies indicated that viruses from the outbreaks in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore, Toronto, and Taiwan are clonally related. [21] [22] [23] [24] Compliance with standard precautions, alertness and using inline suction for the undiagnosed SARS patient (first SARS patient in Taiwan) who had respiratory failure and was intubated in the emergency room (ER) were the reasons that no HCWs became seropositive and no intrahospital spread occurred before implementation of specific infection control strategies at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH). 25 Unexpectedly, the good performance of NTUH during the initial phase of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan resulted in underestimation of the continuous risk of transmission from the neighboring affected areas into Taiwan. [26] [27] [28] A similar situation developed in Canada and resulted in a second wave of the epidemic. 29",

For example, aerosolgenerating procedures and environmental contamination may have contributed to a large intrahospital spread in the epidemic of SARS. 6, 33 A recent study revealed that the independent risk factors associated with nosocomial outbreaks of SARS among hospital wards in Guangzhou and Hong Kong, China, included a distance between beds of \u2264 1 m, lack of availability of washing or changing facilities for staff (protective), resuscitation performed in the ward, staff members working while experiencing symptoms, host patient (index patient or the first patient with SARS admitted to a ward) requiring oxygen therapy, and host patient requiring bi-level positive airway pressure ventilation. 34 Two aforementioned phenomena warrant caution when we are facing emerging pandemic influenza: travel and super-spreading events. 35, 36 It is anticipated that adults undertaking international travel might be infected and spread the disease worldwide, as noted during the SARS epidemic. 4 Once the elderly and persons with chronic illnesses are infected, the clinical presentation might be atypical and masked by comorbidities. Furthermore, viral load might be high and viral shedding might be prolonged in immunocompromised hosts, resulting in a high chance of spread. 37 Thus, super-spreading events should be taken into consideration during preparedness for a pandemic. The community, patients and visitors should be educated in addition to HCWs.",

However, two overlapping sets of disease signs and symptoms have been reported, with some patients having varying degrees of enteric disease. Diarrhea developed early in the course of disease. 38, 39 Up to seven of the first 10 patients at NTUH 38 and five of the first 10 patients in Canada 40 had diarrhea. Although a review of data from China, Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore showed that only 20.1% of patients had diarrhea, 2 up to 73.3% of 75 patients treated with ribavirin and steroids had watery diarrhea. 41 Some of these differences may result from the timing and quality of data collection. In our cohort, diarrhea developed before the occurrence of cough [42] [43] [44] and became exacerbated in parallel to desaturation in the second week of illness. 38, 41 SARS-CoV in feces was identified by RT-PCR in 97% at day 14 and positivity rates were highest in feces, followed by nasopharyngeal aspirates and urine samples. 41 The virus is stable in feces and urine and can survive after drying on surfaces. 45, 46 Thus, contamination of the environment by infectious respiratory secretions or other body fluids (e.g. saliva, tears, urine, feces) may play a role in disease transmission. 28, 33 Thus, educating HCWs, patients, caregivers and visitors to maintain both hand hygiene and environmental hygiene together are important. SARS-CoV is completely inactivated by \u2264 5 minutes of exposure to 75% ethanol, 500 ppm hypochlorite, and household detergent. 45, 46 Disinfection and disinfestations are important in healthcare settings and households. Disinfection of the sewage system, elimination of rodents and cockroaches, and proper garbage disposal are also important.",

Yet it is not practical and cost-effective to screen every patient with febrile illness when the incidence of disease is relatively low or when the epidemic becomes overwhelming. Screening tools using easily available symptomatic and laboratory items are highly desirable. A 6-item clinical score was developed for triaging patients with febrile illness in the emergency room. [42] [43] [44] The sensitivity reached 92.6% and the specificity 71.2%. 42 In this model, we emphasize the sequential development of symptoms and diarrhea in addition to cough. 44 As this scoring system was implemented irrespective of the epidemiological link, it was useful when SARS was spreading in the community. However, limitations remained. As this discrimination system was generated during non-influenza seasons and the majority of patients in the deprivation cohort were otherwise healthy adults, the predictive value decreased in the validation cohort when patients with comorbidity acquired SARS. 43 The predictive value is anticipated to decrease in those without immunity to seasonal influenza during the influenza season.",

The scale of interventions required to control an epidemic depends on the number of infectious cases present at the time the control measures are instituted and on logistical constraints, such as availability of isolation facilities. Furthermore, isolation and quarantine procedures will be less effective as more cases accrue. 68 Therefore, stringent measures implemented early in the course of the epidemic prevent the need for more stringent measures as the epidemic spreads. 18 Nevertheless, it is practical and most feasible that routine infection control strategies and traditional, standard interventions used during outbreak control should be applied immediately before laboratory confirmation of the causative agent. Hand and respiratory hygiene should be promoted. Domestic cleaning using household cleaning products, to reduce transmission via fomites and from infectious respiratory secretions on surfaces, is important as well. 12",

The environment surrounding an outbreak is unique in public health. Outbreaks are frequently marked by uncertainty, confusion and a sense of urgency. Communication failures delay outbreak control, undermine public trust and compliance, and unnecessarily prolong economic, social and political turmoil. If implemented effectively, guidelines for outbreak communication will result in greater public resilience and guide appropriate public participation to support the rapid containment of an outbreak, thus limiting morbidity and mortality. 69 In addition, effective outbreak communication will minimize the damage to a nation's international standing, its economy and its public health infrastructure.
