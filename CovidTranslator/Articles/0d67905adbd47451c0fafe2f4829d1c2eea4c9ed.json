I marshal evidence that asymptomatic host individuals maintain persistent populations of viral pathogens; that these pathogens replicate; that they are often extremely variable; that selection within hosts causes the evolution of pathogens better able to exploit the host; that selection is host-specific; and that such evolving infections cause appreciable and progressive deterioration. Experimental approaches to testing the theory are discussed.",

            "text": "The inescapable aging of multicellular organisms might arise in either of two fundamentally different ways. First, the internal capacity to resist and repair damage might be less in older individuals. Because the force of selection declines with age, germ-line mutations which impair function late in life will accumulate more rapidly than those with comparable effects early in life, and mutations which increase vigour early in life may spread even if they have severely deleterious effects later in life. This is the conventional evolutionary explanation of aging, which has received thorough theoretical exploration and substantial experimental support, and which is reviewed at length by other authors in this issue. The second possibility is that the external environment may systematically deteriorate during the lifetime of every individual, so that individuals will senesce even if they are able to maintain a constant level of defence. This paper is concerned exclusively with this possibility, which does not seem to have been investigated previously.",

            "text": "It is obviously out of the question that the physical environment should continually deteriorate during each individual's lifetime, since if this were true the earth would no longer be capable of supporting life. This is not necessarily true of the biotic environment. Antagonists such as pathogens and their hosts are involved in a continuous process of coevolution, in which the evolution of resistance by the host population is eventually overcome by the evolution of new infective abilities by the pathogen populations, which in turn creates selection for new sources of host resistance, and so on, endlessly. On different time-scales, viruses and bacteria, fungi and helminths will all play this continual game of tag with their hosts. Each new advance made by the pathogen population is conditional: it impairs the vigour of some host genotypes, but not of all, and the host population persists because of the increased proliferation of host genotypes which are not susceptible to the novel pathogen adaptation. Consequently, it is conceivable that the average individual host, at any time, may perceive the environment as continually deteriorating, because of genetic changes in pathogen populations which increase its susceptibility to disease, while the host population is nevertheless able to maintain itself through geological time.",

            "text": "To clarify this idea, consider a thought experiment which contrasts the fate of individuals with the fate of clones each consisting of many genetically identical individuals. Suppose that we constructed many replicate clones, all of the same genotype, and measured the life table of these replicates, each of which might comprise many individuals, in the same way that we might measure the life table of individuals within any of these clones. If we did measure the life table of individuals belonging to a given clone, we would almost certainly find that the rate of survival (or, in principle, some other component of fitness) decreased with age, indicating that individuals senesce. There is, however, no obvious reason to suspect that this would apply to replicate clones able to propagate themselves through time. It is conceivable that reproduction earlier in time is more important than later reproduction, perhaps because an early-reproducing clone would occupy available space or opportunities more quickly. But it is difficult to see how the reproductive activity of the founders of the clone could systematically reduce the vigour of their descendants, a quite separate set of individuals, many generations later. It seems reasonable to conclude that clones will not senesce, even though each individual member of the clone does. On this basis, we should expect to find that each clone has a fixed probability of becoming extinct in any interval of time, so that the number of surviving clones decreases exponentially through time. Clones with different genotypes might have different rates of extinction, of course; the important point is that for any given genotype this rate would be a constant that did not increase through time. This conclusion will fail if one of two additional processes is operating: if either the genotype itself, or the environment in which it is expressed, tends continually to deteriorate through time.",

Mutation will drive an increase in genetic diversity, until the input of new genetic diversity through mutation is just balanced by the erosion of diversity by selection, at which point the clonally propagated population is in equilibrium, and will maintain the same level of diversity from generation to generation. This argument is not quite true for finite populations, in which the occasional stochastic loss of the class of individuals with the fewest mutations will drive an irreversible increase in the mean number of mutations per indi-vidual. Because most mutations are somewhat deleterious, the vigour of a finite clone will tend to decrease through time (Muller, 1964; Haigh, 1978) . The process can actually be observed in very small clones of asexual protists (Bell, 1988) . This paper is not concerned with genetic deterioration of this sort.",

I assume for simplicity that each clone is completely uniform, removing this restriction later. At first, each clone will survive well, because there has not yet been sufficient time for local pathogens to evolve efficient methods of infection. As time goes on, selection will favour pathogen variants able to exploit this new resource effectively, and as the frequency of such variants increases the survival rate of all the replicate clones will fall. Evolution of the local pathogen community will therefore cause a decrease in clonal survival through time; the set of clones will senesce.",

The first is the life table of clones, for organisms in which reproduction produces distinct individuals rather than physically connected ramets or zooids. Claims for the extreme longevity of some clones in plants which reproduce vegetatively, such as creosote bush (Vasek, 1980) and bracken (Olinonen, 1967) , are commonplace, but beside the point: large organisms are usually long-lived, but the crucial information on the rate of mortality in relation to age is lacking. Secondly, deliberate experiments in which the survival rate of a clone which is continually replanted into a natural community is compared with that of the same clone maintained in the greenhouse would provide important information (Bell, 1992) , but so far as I know none have ever been reported. Finally, accidental experiments are done every time agronomists develop a new clone or inbred line of crop plant and release it for largescale cultivation. The result is very often a dramatic process of senescence in which the failure of the new variety is quickly brought about by the evolution of local pathogen populations (Barrett, 1981; Wolfe, 1985) .",

            "text": "The relevance of clonal senescence to individual senescence is that multicellular individuals are mitotic clones of cells. The cells may vary dramatically in phenotype, but all are genetically identical, or nearly so. When a pathogen infects a host individual, it may proliferate so successfully that the host is killed quickly by the disease it causes. More often, the growth of the pathogen population is suppressed by host defences, and disease symptoms cease, or never appear. The absence of symptoms is normally taken to imply elimination of the pathogen. Suppose, however, that a small population of the pathogen, made up of somewhat more resistant forms, persists in host tissues. This population continues to reproduce, but is prevented from increasing in numbers, and thereby causing overt symptoms, by host defences. As time goes on, however, variants which are able to replicate somewhat more successfully will be selected in the pathogen population resident in the host. These variants are those pathogen genotypes which happen to be best able to exploit the genotype of the particular host in which they are evolving, and may differ from individual to individual. However, although the pathogen population within the host can evolve adaptation to the host genotype, the host itself cannot evolve, being an individual and not a population. As the pathogen population continues to evolve more effective ways of circumventing host defences, the rate of replication and the abundance of the pathogen will tend to increase, causing a progressive increase in the level of damage sustained by the host, which is macroscopically apparent as a senescent decline in survival or fecundity. Eventually, the host dies, either because the pathogen finally eludes host defences entirely and breaks out to cause acute disease, or because the indirect effects of increased levels of damage caused by evolving pathogens result in the host starving to death or being eaten by a predator.",

Hosts which possess an immune system can evolve, in a sense, to a changing population of pathogens, by producing lymphocytes with altered specificities. The way in which they do this is strikingly similar to the way in which sexual lineages can maintain resistance to external popula-23 tions of pathogens -the creation of variation by genetic recombination, followed by the increase in frequency under selection of variants which happen by chance to be resistant. Nevertheless, the range of pathogen genotypes to which a given host genotype can respond effectively is limited, and selection among pathogens can eventually cause the emergence of types able to evade immune surveillance. Immune systems are likely to retard but not to prevent the evolution of increasingly virulent resident populations of pathogens.",

Avian leukosis virus and the various hepatitis viruses cause liver necrosis and neoplastic diseases (Nehyba et al., 1990) .

Persistent infections by hepatitis B virus are likely to lead to liver disease if the virus is replicating (Fattovich et aL, 1990) . Coxsackie virus B3 persists in myocardium; the development of myocardial lesions is correlated with the rate of virus replication (Klingel et al., 1992) .

Murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus has two sites of infection: the central nervous sytem, where populations similar to the initial infection cause acute disease, and lymphoid tissue, where altered viruses cause a persistent infection. This difference is associated with a single amino-acid substitution in the viral glycoprotein (Ahmed et aL, 1991) . Macrophage isolates of this virus tended to grow well in cultured macrophages but poorly in lymphocytes, and vice versa (King et al., 1990) , so the occurrence of tissue-specific selection can be modelled in culture. A single passage through the host causes the appearance of tissue-specific variants of bovine herpes virus 1 (Whetstone et aL, 1989) . The divergence of viral populations in different tissues provides evidence for the occurrence of adaptive evolution within the host. Some variants in heterogeneous viral populations can escape host defences and are cytopathic. Some variants of measles virus in persistent infections are resistant to interferon (Carrigan & Knox, 1990) . Variants of hepatitis A virus isolated from persistently-infected monkey cells were cytophatic (Lemon et al., 1991) . The appearance of variants which evade immune surveillance has been reported for visna view of sheep (Stanley et al., 1988) and for equine infectious anaemia virus (Salinovich et al., 1986) .",

            "text": "Selection may favour variants with reduced virulence and cytotoxicity in cell culture. This is often associated with the appearance of incomplete viral genomes in the form of so-called defective interfering particles, for example in human parainfluenza virus (Moscona, 1991) , Murray Valley encephalitis virus (Poidinger, Coelen & MacKenzie, 1991) , and tomato bushy stunt virus (Knorr et al., 1991) . Since these are parasites of intact viruses, their effect on the host is difficult to predict. However, in many cases selection alters the population of intact virus. Rubella virus maintained with antibody in cell culture evolved reduced replication and cytotoxicity; these changes took place in intact virus, though defective interfering RNAs also appeared (Abernathy, Wang & Frey, 1990) . The passage of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus through cultured mouse cells results in the evolution of non-pathogenic populations with altered genomes (Bruns et al., 1990) . Pelletier et al. (1991) selected persistent mutants of polio virus in cultured cells, obtaining forms that could persist in non-neural tissue and had altered cell specificity. Measles virus populations may contain two forms resistant to interferon, one of which replicates normally and destroys cells, while the other has reduced replication and cytopathogenicity. The passage of populations containing both forms through nervous tissue of hamsters selects strongly for the less damaging form, causing chronic persistence of the virus. The outcome of such processes depends on the balance between vertical transmission (through the reproduction of infected cells) and horizontal transmission (through the movement of virus from infected to uninfected cells). Reducing the importance of horizontal transmission, for example by the presence of soluble antibody, will shift the balance towards vertical transmission and favour the evolution of benignity. The study of hepatitis A virus by Lemon et al. (1991) is a particularly clear description of the mechanism involved: altered forms with reduced antigenicity have greater rates of replication during persistent infection, while normal forms have greater rates during serial passage.",

Types which are initially rare may increase greatly in frequency (Zweig et al., 1990; Vartanian et al., 1991) . Specific variants resistant to drugs are readily selected (Gao et al., 1992) . More importantly, passage in the presence of soluble antibody causes the evolution of resistant populations (Robert-Guroff et al., 1986; Masuda et aL, 1990; McKeating et al., 1991; Ashkenazi et al., 1991; Rey et aL, 1991) , and may occur even in highly conserved regions of the viral genome.

Whether or not they are generally true must await the accumulation of evidence. However, the availability of methods for amplifying viral genomes present at very low abundance in host tissues will make it possible to decide very soon whether the single most important and most surprising observation which the theory requires, the universality of persistent viral infection, is really the case. Should all the conditions be shown to hold generally, it will still remain to be shown that they operate so as to produce senescence. An obvious experimental approach is to rear rigorously pathogen-free stocks by isolating sterile eggs and raising them in enclosed or filtered environments. The suggestion that senescence is caused by the diseases associated with internal populations of microbes was first made by Metchnikoff in the early 1900s. He emphasized the deleterious nature of toxins produced by the bacterial population of the large bowel, but also described the pathological behaviour of lymphocytes (whose phagocytic properties he discovered) and thus autoimmune diseases. His theory was quite different from that being advanced here: he attributed senescence to the long-continued action of bacterial toxins without reference to the possibility of pathogen evolution within the host. It was thought to be adequately refuted by the observation that animals reared in bacteria-free conditions were not immortal, and indeed usually died without notably exceeding their normal span. The current neglect of his ideas may not be completely justified. For example, Greenberg and Burkman (1963) compared bacteria-free with normal adult flies, recording average lifespan for both sexes in two experiments. There was no difference between the two groups in two comparisons, but in the remaining two (concerning females in one case and males in the other) the bacteria-free flies lived much longer. However, I have been unable to find observations of the longevity of defined strains of animal under bacteria-free conditions which would support the crucial test of whether rates of mortality increase with age when cellular pathogens are excluded. A detailed quantitative life table for a colony of bacteria-free mice would be of great interest.",

Some virus will be transmitted in the egg, of course, but because elements which are exclusively vertically transmitted are not expected to be pathogenic (mouse mammary tumour virus seems to be an exception), this is not necessarily a problem in principle. If such stocks could be shown to be virus-free and did not senesce, the theory would be supported. In practice, the possibility that some retroviruses are partly horizontally and partly vertically transmitted, and that purely endogenous viruses might in time evolve exogenous variants, might cloud the interpretation of a negative result.

First, the reduced levels of maintenance and repair in older individuals that evolve as the consequence of the decrease in the force of natural selection with increasing age will make it easier for persistent populations of pathogens to evolve resistance to host defences. Secondly, the prospect that persistent pathogen populations will become steadily better adapted during the lifetime of the host further devalues the maintenance of vigour in old individuals, and therefore advances the schedules of antagonistic pleiotropy and mutation accumulation.",

            "text": "A very similar theory has been developed for the particular case of HIV infection by Nowak (1992; Nowak & May, 1991) . This virus represents a special case because it attacks the very cells that are responsible for its suppression, and in consequence the dynamics of its evolution in the host are more complex. Nowak's theory differs from the simpler theory advanced in this paper in that the heterogeneity of the viral population plays a central role in disease progression, rather than merely providing a basis for selection of more effective variants. The crucial concept is that the immune cells whose production is specifically induced by a given viral genotype are active only against that genotype, whereas they can themselves be killed by any intact virus. It follows that more heterogenous viral populations will suppress the immune response more effectively, and that there exists a threshold value of viral diversity beyond which the immune system is incapable of restraining the virus and preventing progression to AIDS. It is likely that the immune response is not completely specific, so that new clones of immune cells are active not only against the particular viral genotype responsible for their induction, but also against a range of other genotypes. If viral genotypes exist which can survive a non-specific response (when this is not true, the initial infection is quickly cleared) but not the combined effect of the specific and non-specific responses, then there will be an initial viremia, perhaps accompanied by clinical symptoms, followed by a reduction in virus titre and a long and variable period of persistence before the viral diversity threshold is exceeded and a final phase of acute disease ensues. Differential-equation models of this process are strikingly successful in capturing the major features of the time-course of HIV infection. Whether they are preferable to the simpler theory of the sequential selection of more effective pathogen genotypes from a population whose diversity is maintained by high mutation rates is not clear. One possible approach might be to construct the phylogeny of the evolving viral population, because simple within-host selection implies the sequential replacement of currently abundant variants by slightly modified descendents, whereas Nowak's theory implies that there is no single successful line of descent. Alternatively, simple within-host selection would lead us to expect that the final HIV population causing AIDS would be more homogeneous than the persistent population during the asymptomatic phase, since the single viral strain able to overcome host defences would spread to fixation; this seems to correspond with the situation described by Wolfs et al. (1991). Nowak's theory leads us to expect, to the contrary, that the final HIV population will be maximally heterogeneous. However, he suggests that the breakdown of immune function which is eventually caused by increasing viral diversity itself permits rapidly-replicating viral genotypes to be selected, creating genetic uniformity as a consequence rather than a cause of the development of acute disease. This may well be the case; the coupled dynamics of HIV infection and the immune system may necessitate a more complicated explanation than is required for other diseases. The more general significance of the experimental and theoretical work on HIV is that is provides a dramatic illustration of how evolutionary processes driven by within-host selection cause a cumulative and eventually catastrophic collapse of host vigour.",
