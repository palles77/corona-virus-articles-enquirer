Molecular testing was performed using the MultiCode-PLx Respiratory PCR panel (EraGen Biosciences, Madison, WI).

The reaction products were hybridized to a microsphere-based array, and analyzed on a bench-top flowcell, Luminex-200 (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX).

However, children do not accept NPW well, and this accounted for patients who either declined to participate in the study, or withdrew after the first sample. The small numbers of patients further precluded correlation of URTI or duration of shedding with transplant associated variables, and limits our ability to draw conclusions on the implications of asymptomatic detection of respiratory virus in the transplant setting. This underscores the need for subsequent studies with sequential collection of samples to determine the course of asymptomatic shedding in HCT patients.",

Inferences on causality, based on detection of HRV and hCoV in symptomatic HCT patients, should be made with caution, since these viruses are shed and detectable in asymptomatic patients. Future studies using a quantitative detection approach with viral load cutoffs to determine which children with asymptomatic shedding prior to transplant are predisposed to develop symptomatic disease are warranted. This may have implications for infection control in pediatric HCT units. Patients with human rhinovirus (HRV), human adenovirus (hADV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and human coronavirus (hCoV), detected at week 0 (first nasal wash pretransplant), and at 2,4,6,8,10,12, and 14 weeks after the first wash. Follow up samples where a wash was done but no virus detected are shown as negative (\u2212).",
