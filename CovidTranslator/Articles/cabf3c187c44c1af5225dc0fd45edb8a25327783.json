We employed a photo immobilization methodology based on a photoactivatable electrogenerated poly(pyrrole-benzophenone) film deposited upon an indium tin oxide (ITO) modified conductive surface fiber-optic. It was then linked to a biological receptor, Ebola virus antigen in this case, on the fiber tip through a light driven reaction. The photochemically modified optical fibers were tested as an immunosensor for detection of antibodies against Ebola virus, in animal and human sera, by use of a coupled chemiluminescent reaction. The immunosensor was tested for sensitivity, specificity, and compared to standard chemiluminescent ELISA under the same conditions. The analyte, anti-Ebola IgG, was detected at a low titer of 1:960,000 and 1:1,000,000 for subtypes Zaire and Sudan, respectively. While the same serum tested by ELISA was one order (24 times) less sensitive.",

There are four species of Ebola virus that have been identified: Zaire, Sudan, Ivory Coast, and Reston. All four species differ in their virulence; thus acute mortality in human outbreaks is typically greater than 80% for Ebola virus Zaire strain and greater than 50% for Sudan. Ebola Zaire and Sudan viruses are the most widespread and have been responsible for the majority of the recent hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in humans [1] [2] [3] . The last large outbreak occurred in [2000] [2001] in the Gulu district of Uganda. In total, there were 425 cases with 224 deaths. This case fatality rate of 53% was similar to that observed for two previous outbreaks of Ebola virus Sudan in 1976 and 1979 in which 53% and 66% of cases died, respectively [4] [5] [6] .",

This fiber-optic electroconductive surface modification was achieved by deposition of a thin layer of indium tin oxide (ITO). ITO is an indium oxide (In 2 O 3 )-based material that has been doped with tin oxide (SnO 2 ) to improve its electrical quality. Tin acts as a cationic dopant in the In 2 O 3 lattice and substitutes indium sites to bind with interstitial oxygen. The presence of SnO 2 results in n doping of the lattice because the dopant adds electrons to the conduction band [20] . We must take care to produce thinner films of indium tin oxide even though there is a correlation between thicker films and lower resistivity, as lower light transmission may occur due to absorption by the film [21] . Since sputtering is one of the most extensively used techniques for deposition of transparent conducting oxide films, it was selected as the deposition technique. This method renders far better control over the stoichiometry, obviating, in most cases, the heat treatment step, which is usually performed after deposition of the film. Highly transparent and conductive films of ITO have been previously deposited by this technique [16, 22] .",

In order to produce the desired activation radiation we used a 1000 W Xe lamp (Oriel 6271) mount connected to a light condenser (Oriel 66021). The light was reflected through a dichroic mirror (Oriel 66226). The spectrum radiation was then condensed into the monochromator (Oriel 77250) using the appropriate lenses (Oriel, plano-convex lenses). After this, a 345 nm wavelength light output, with a light intensity of 80 mW cm \u22122 (as measured by an Ophir Optronics power-meter Nova reader, PD300-UV) was projected for 7 min into the far end of the optical fiber that was coated at its nearend with poly(pyrrole-benzophenone) and soaked in 120 l of an inactivated Ebola virus solution during irradiation. The excited benzophenone radicals could then bind to neighboring proteins in the solution, in our case Ebola virus antigens (approximately 7.5 g/ml).",

Therefore, this enables a direct comparison of results, and reveals that the immunosensor is much more sensitive than chemiluminescence ELISA and is likely capable of recognizing virus specific antibody presence in the sera of patients in earlier stages of disease. Finally, the optical fiber immunoassay showed a greater lower detection limit than ELISA.

Although these data are limited by the number of sera samples available for verification, one of the healthy volunteers from the same geographical region showed a positive reaction to inactivated Ebola virus when tested with the immunosensor. An ELISA test for the same person was negative due to relatively low sensitivity of the method as was reviled in standard calibration curves for ELISA and immunosensor (Figs. 4 and 5) .

The model analyte, anti-Ebola IgG, was detected at a low titer of 1:960,000 and 1:1,000,000 for subtypes Zaire and Sudan, respectively. Even though our ability to evaluate the sera of known infections with this group of viruses was limited by the availability of appropriate sera, we believe that the results are encouraging and strongly suggest that this immunosensor will prove a preferable alternative to ELISA for measurement of antibodies to Ebola viruses. Dr. Alex Chepurnov, PhD, heads the Biosafety Level 4 Virus Laboratory at Russia's State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology in Novosibirsk, commonly referred to world-wide as \"Vector\". He is one of the leading Russian experts on the Ebola virus and has studied the host response to this virus as well as methods for treatment. Most of his own research focuses on Ebola Zaire, the deadliest strain of Ebola.",

Dr. Lobel is now in the Department of Virology in the Faculty of Health Sciences of Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel. His current work focuses on immunovirology and he studies the human humoral immune response to a variety of infectious diseases that include smallpox, Hepatitis C, Ebola and West Nile virus. He has isolated a library of fully human monoclonal antibodies from patients immunized against smallpox and from patients that were infected with Hepatitis C. Currently Dr. Lobel focuses on more deadly diseases, such as Ebola, for development of immunotherapeutic tools and synthetic vaccines.",
