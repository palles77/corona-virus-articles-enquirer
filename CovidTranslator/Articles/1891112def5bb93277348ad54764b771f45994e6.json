            "text": "An association between the development of asthma in childhood and viral respiratory tract infections has been recognized for several decades. Acute viral infections are important triggers of wheezing in children and asthma exacerbation in both children and adults.7, 16, 55 Using polymerase chain reactionbased methods of detection, recent studies found that more than 80% of wheezing episodes in school children were associated with viral respiratory tract infection^.^^ In more than 60% of these patients, rhinovirus (RV) was detected.41 In infants and toddlers under the age of 2 years, the virus most frequently isolated during wheezing episodes is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).39, 52 Parainfluenza viruses (PIV), corona virus, adenovirus, influenza virus, and enteroviruses have all been implicated in the development or exacerbation of wheezing.39, 57 Some of the epidemiologic evidence suggests that respiratory viruses may both trigger asthma exacerbation and contribute to the enhancement of allergic sensitization and subsequent development of allergic asthma. An association between viral respiratory tract infections and the onset of allergic sensitization in children born into allergic families has been proposed. 27 The close link between virus-induced bronchiolitis and development of asthma has been recognized in several 53, 73, 74, 76, 82 In a prospective cohort study with matched controls, RSV bronchiolitis in infancy was identified as the most important risk factor for the development of asthma and sensitization to common allergens by the age of 3 years.n This risk was further increased when there was a family history of asthma or atopy. By the age of 7 years, asthma was still more prevalent in the group of children who had RSV bronchiolitis in the first year of life than in the control p o p~l a t i o n . ~~ Some studies indicate that RSV bronchiolitis at an early age results in bronchial hyperreactivity persisting for more than 10 yearP and may even be associated with chronic pulmonary disease persisting into adulthood?, A criticism of these epidemiologic studies has been that by selecting children with RSV disease severe enough to require hospitalization, the selection might also favor those with an atopic predisposition or intrinsic abnormalities of airway function.",

In a substantial minority who were \"persistent wheezed'-i.e., children who developed wheezing in the first 3 years of life that persisted beyond the age of 6 years, wheezing was associated with allergic sensitization and a history of maternal asthma.51 These children also had elevated serum levels of total immunoglobulin (1g)E during the acute phase of their first lower respiratory tract infection as well as eosinophilia in the peripheral blood, in contrast to transient wheezers and children without asthmatic symptoms during acute Furthermore, these children demonstrated reduced airway function at the age of 6 years, having had normal lung function after birth. At the age of 11 years, this group showed similar characteristics.R A stratification of a birth cohort according to the viruses detected during respiratory tract infection confirmed that the majority of infections before the age of 3 years were associated with RSV. For this group of children with RSV infection, an increased odds ratio for wheezing, both infrequent and frequent, was demonstrated at the age of 6 years. Interestingly, this risk diminished with age and was not significant by 13 years of age.7s Fur-thermore, the rate of allergic sensitization did not differ between children with or without respiratory tract infection at any age78 and the authors concluded that RSV infection was not associated with allergic sensitization and that both atopy and RSV infection are independent risk factors for the development of asthma. The reversible reduction in airway function suggested that RSV infection may induce a dysregulation of airway tone but provides no evidence for fixed abnormalities of airway function as a consequence of infection.",

The sum of the epidemiologic data available indicates that viral respiratory tract infections in the very young may cause transient asthmatic symptoms or may trigger the early development of asthma in children with a genetic predisposition to atopy, rather than inducing allergic sensitization in and of itself. This raises the possibility of synergistic interactions between respiratory tract viral infections, predisposition to atopy, and sensitization to aero-allergens, resulting in the development of persistent airway inflammation and asthma. Such interactions have been demonstrated in children presenting to an emergency room, where the combination of atopy and concurrent respiratory tract viral illness was associated with the greatest risk for asthma symptoms.18 Overall, the relationships between viral respiratory infections and development of persistent wheezing or asthma are complex and still illdefined. Nonetheless, the prevailing view is that viral infections, including RSV, are not a major factor in the induction of atopic asthma.",

Development of allergic asthma reflects the interplay between strong genetic predisposition and the development of an airway inflammatory response following allergen or other exposures, most often characterized by infiltration of eosinophils and neutrophils. The consequence of a respiratory virus infection may be dictated by the host's immune response to the virus; in most cases, this response results in the relatively rapid curtailment of the infection. In some individuals, however, the response to infection results in exacerbation of underlying changes in airway function, resulting in more persistent wheezing. Investigations in human and animal models have revealed possible clues to pathogenesis, some of which have been reviewed recentlyz3, 56, 81 Respiratory viruses, especially RSV, often initially infect the respiratory epithelium of the upper airways but the infection can spread to the lower airways. Following RSV bronchiolitis, viral antigen can be detected in the br0nchioles.5~ Rodent and other animal models also show evidence of lower airway infection.\" 61 Rhinovirus, the classical cold virus, which was thought to infect upper airways exclusively, also is capable of infecting the lower airways.

Cationic proteins released by eosinophils are capable of binding to presynaptic M2 muscarinic receptors on postgan-glionic parasympathic airway nerves. The resulting blockade interrupts an inhibitory feedback mechanism, resulting in increased release of acetylcholine and in increased airway muscle tone and reactivity. This mechanism has been demonstrated both in models of allergic sensitization and following acute viral Parainfluenza virus neuraminidase can also bind to M2 muscarinic receptors directly and may be responsible for the effects described in the absence of eosinophilic inflammation.28 In addition, viral infection and interferon (IFN)-y downregulate M2receptor gene",

In these experi-mental approaches, enhanced allergic sensitization was thought to be caused by increased allergen uptake across inflamed mucous membranes. Indeed, in both a guinea pig and a mouse model, exposure to ovalbumin aerosol caused increased levels of serum ovalbumin if administered during acute virus 63 The authors recently reported on a murine model of RSV infection and subsequent sensitization to aerosolized ~v a l b u m i n .~~ In this model, exposure to allergen over 10 days was begun only after complete resolution of the acute (RSV) infection. This resulted in enhanced responses to allergen and, as a consequence, airway inflammation, with the influx of neutrophils and eosinophils. This was associated with altered airway responsiveness to inhaled methacholine. In contrast to many of the models discussed previously, allergenspecific IgE serum levels were not higher in the group that was infected with RSV prior to allergic sensitization. This may indicate that mechanisms other than increased allergen uptake are responsible for the effects of RSV infection on the subsequent consequences of exposure to allergen. As demonstrated following acute RSV infection, sensitization following infection triggers eosinophilic inflammation and associated AHR. Anti-interleukin (1L)-5 treatment during the allergen exposure phase prevented lung eosinophilia and the development of AHR. 69 To define the role of IL-5 and, specifically, of eosinophils in mediating the effects of RSV infection on subsequent airway sensitization, two approaches were pursued: (1) anti-IL-5 treatment during the infection phase but not during the period of allergen exposure, and (2) infection and sensitization in genetically IL-5-deficient mice and evaluation of the effects of IL-5 reconstitution during the different phases.67 Anti-IL-5 treatment during RSV infection significantly reduced lung eosinophilia and AHR following subsequent allergen exposure via the airways. Mice genetically deficient in IL-5 did not develop lung eosinophilia or AHR following RSV infection and allergen sensitization. Both eosinophilia and AHR were reconstituted if IL-5 was administered during acute infection.

The authors tested the hypothesis that RSV infection induces a T-cell response that mediates the consequences of infection on subsequent allergic sensiti~ation.~~ Following RSV infection, peribronchial lymph nodes, the regional lymph nodes of the lung, were harvested. T cells were isolated and adoptively transferred into noninfected mice, which were then exposed to aerosolized allergen over 10 days. Adoptive transfer of T cells from RSV-infected mice (but not noninfected mice) resulted in lung neutrophilia and eosinophilia as well as AHR following airway allergen exposure. Transfer of isolated CD8+ T cells, but not CD4-t T cells, resulted in similar effects.",

These studies implied that RSV infection triggers CD8 T-cell activation-not just that of cytotoxic, IFN-yproducing, T cells, a dominant T-cell response following viral infection, but also noncytotoxic, IL-5-producing, CD8+ T cells (Tc2 cells). These cells are activated during viral infection and can orchestrate airway eosinophilia.14 It is highly likely that different viral antigens can differentially induce specific immune responses. Some antigens-for example, the RSV G protein-may result in the selective induction of Th2 and Tc2 (CD8+ T cells producing Th2-like cytokines) responses, leading to airway eosinophilia as demonstrated following vaccination against G protein and subsequent RSV challenge. Other components such as RSV F protein may favor development of Tcl responses.2 Interleukin-5-producing CDS+T cells may be primarily responsible for the recruitment of eosinophils during acute RSV infection. These cells may persist following the acute infection and possibly expand as the infection resolves and numbers of cytotoxic CD8 + T cells diminish.",

Epidemiologic data indicate that, for the majority of children, virus-induced wheezing is a selflimited condition, with no long-term consequences. For a substantial minority, however, virus-induced wheezing is associated with persistent asthma and the potential for enhanced allergic sensitization. For the most part, this subset of patients is genetically predisposed; they are atopic children in whom respiratory viral infections trigger the early development of asthma by mechanisms that have not been fully elucidated. Both inflammatory and noninflammatory mechanisms may be involved. It does not appear that viral infection per se in early life is responsible for the induction of atopic asthma. Data from animal models provide support for the concept that enhanced allergic sensitization caused by increased uptake of allergen during infection may play a critical role, as well as T-cell-mediated immune responses to viral infection, which may favor eosinophilic inflammatory responses and the development of altered airway function to inhaled methacholine. Recent advances in our understanding of the interactions between respiratory viruses and the development of reactive airway disease offer new possibilities for preventive treatment in children at risk for developing persistent wheezing and asthma exacerbation as a result of viral infection.
