However, up until recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal-or context-related properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.",

The main goals were (i) the extraction of unifying principles that could encompass and describe (under some generic and universal rules) the structural accommodation that is being detected ubiquitously, and (ii) the modeling of the resulting emergent dynamics to explain what we actually see and experience from the observation of such systems.",

At this initial stage, instead, and together with the pioneering articles [1-4] and classical books [5] [6] [7] [8] on complex networks, we address the interested reader to some other reports [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] that were published recently on this same Journal, which we believe may constitute very good guides to find orientation into the immensely vast literature on the subject. In particular, Ref. [9] is a complete compendium of the ideas and concepts involved in both structural and dynamical properties of complex networks, whereas Refs. [12, 13] have the merit of accompanying and orienting the reader through the relevant literature discussing modular networks [12] , and space-embedded networks [13] . Finally, Refs. [10, 11] constitute important accounts on the state of the art for what concerns the study of synchronous organization of networking systems [11] , and processes like evolutionary games on networks [10] .",

However, it is easy to realize that treating all the network's links on such an equivalent footing is too big a constraint, and may occasionally result in not fully capturing the details present in some real-life problems, leading even to incorrect descriptions of some phenomena that are taking place on real-world networks.",

            "text": "The following three examples are representative, in our opinion, of the major limitation of that approach. The first example is borrowed from sociology. Social networks analysis is one of the most used paradigms in behavioral sciences, as well as in economics, marketing, and industrial engineering [14] , but some questions related to the real structure of social networks have been not properly understood. A social network can be described as a set of people (or groups of people) with some pattern of contacts or interactions between them [14, 15] . At a first glance, it seems natural to assume that all the connections or social relationships between the members of the network take place at the same level. But the real situation is far different. The actual relationships amongst the members of a social network take place (mostly) inside of different groups (levels or layers), and therefore they cannot be properly modeled if only the natural local-scale point of view used in classic complex network models is taken into account. Let us for a moment think to the problem of spreading of information, or rumors, on top of a social network like Facebook. There, all users can be seen as nodes of a graph, and all the friendships that users create may be considered as the network's links. However, friendships in Facebook may result from relationships of very different origins: two Facebook's users may share a friendship because they are colleagues in their daily occupations, or because they are fans of the same football team, or because they occasionally met during their vacation time in some resort, or for any other possible social reason. Now, suppose that a given user gets aware of a given information and wants to spread it to its Facebook's neighborhood of friends. It is evident that the user will first select that subgroup of friends that he/she believes might be potentially interested to the specific content of the information, and only after will proceed with spreading it to that subgroup. As a consequence, representing Facebook as a unique network of acquaintances (and simulating there a classical diffusion model) would result in drawing incorrect conclusions and predictions of the real dynamics of the system. Rather, the correct way to proceed is instead to chart each social group into a different layer of interactions, and operating the spreading process separately on each layer. As we will see in Section 5, such a multilayer approach leads actually to a series of dramatic and important consequences.",

            "text": "A second paradigmatic example of intrinsically multirelational (or multiplex) systems is the situation that one has to tackle when trying to describe transportation networks, as for instance the Air Transportation Network (ATN) [16] or subway networks [17, 18] . In particular, the traditional study of ATN is by representing it as a single-layer network, where nodes represent airports, while links stand for direct flights between two airports. On the other hand, it is clear that a more accurate mapping is considering that each commercial airline corresponds instead to a different layer, containing all the connections operated by the same company. Indeed, let us suppose for a moment that one wants to make predictions on the propagation of the delays in the flight scheduling through the system, or the effects of such a dynamics on the movement of passengers [19] . In particular, Ref. [16] considered the problem of passenger rescheduling when a fraction of the ATN links, i.e. of flights, is randomly removed. It is well known that each commercial airline incurs in a rather high cost whenever a passenger needs to be rescheduled on a flight of another company, and therefore it tries first to reschedule the passenger by the use of the rest of its own network. As we will see in full details in Section 7, the proper framework where predictions about such dynamical processes can be made suitably is, in fact, considering the ATN as a fully multilayer structure.",

For instance, the Caenorhabditis elegans or C. elegans is a small nematode, and it is actually the first ever organism for which the entire genome was sequenced. Recently, biologists were even able to get a full mapping of the C. elegans' neural network, which actually consists of 281 neurons and around two thousands of connections. On their turn, neurons can be connected either by a chemical link, or by an ionic channel, and the two types of connections have completely different dynamics. As a consequence, the only proper way to describe such a network is a multiplex graph with 281 nodes and two layers, one for the chemical synaptic links and a separate one for the gap junctions' interactions. The most important consequence is that each neuron can play a very different role in the two layers, and a proper ranking should be then able to distinguish those cases in which a node of high centrality in a layer is just marginally central in the other.",

Section 3 summarizes the various (growing and not growing) models that have been introduced so far for generating artificial multilayer networks with specific structural features. In particular, we extensively review the available literature for the two classes of models considered so far: that of growing multiplex networks (in which the number of nodes grows in time and fundamental rules are imposed to govern the dynamics of the network structure), and that of multiplex network ensembles (which are ultimately ensembles of networks satisfying a certain set of structural constraints).",

            "text": "1. Multiplex networks. As we stated before, a multiplex network [28] M, with M layers is a set of layers {G \u03b1 ; \u03b1 \u2208 {1, . . . , M}}, where each layer is a (directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted) graph G \u03b1 = (X \u03b1 , E \u03b1 ), with X \u03b1 = {x 1 , . . . , x N }. As all layers have the same nodes, this can be thought of as a multilayer network by taking X 1 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = X M = X and E \u03b1\u03b2 = {(x, x); x \u2208 X } for every 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u0338 = \u03b2 \u2264 M. 2. Temporal networks [29] . A temporal network (G(t)) T t=1 can be represented as a multilayer network with a set of layers {G 1 , . . . , G T } where G t = G(t), E \u03b1\u03b2 = \u2205 if \u03b2 \u0338 = \u03b1 + 1, while E \u03b1,\u03b1+1 = {(x, x); x \u2208 X \u03b1 \u2229 X \u03b1+1 } (9) (see the schematic illustration of Fig. 1 ). Notice that here t is an integer, and not a continuous parameter as it will be used later on in Section 6.1.1. 3 . Interacting or interconnected networks [24] . If we consider a family of networks {G 1 , . . . , G L } that interact, they can be modeled as a multilayer network of layers {G 1 , . . . , G L } and whose crossed layers E \u03b1\u03b2 correspond to the interactions between network G \u03b1 and G \u03b2 (see Fig. 2 ). 4. Multidimensional networks [20, [30] [31] [32] [33] . Formally, an edge-labeled multigraph (multidimensional network) [30] is a triple G = (V , E, D) where V is a set of nodes, D is a set of labels representing the dimensions, and E is a set of labeled edges, i.e. it is a set of triples E = {(u, v, d); u, v \u2208 V , d \u2208 D}. It is assumed that given a pair of nodes u, v \u2208 V and a label d \u2208 D, there may exist only one edge (u, v, d) . Moreover, if the model considered is a directed graph, the edges (u, v, d) and (v, u, d) are distinct. Thus, given |D| = m, each pair of nodes in G can be connected by at most m possible edges. When needed, it is possible to consider weights, so that the edges are no longer triplets, but quadruplets (u, v, d, w), where w is a real number representing the weight of the relation between nodes u, v \u2208 V and labeled with d \u2208 D. A multidimensional network G = (V , E, D) can be modeled as a multiplex network (and therefore, as a multilayer network) by mapping each label to a layer. Specifically, G can be associated to a multilayer network of layers {G 1 , . . . , G |D| } where for every \u03b1 \u2208 D, G \u03b1 = (X \u03b1 , E \u03b1 ), X \u03b1 = V , (10) and E \u03b1\u03b2 = {(x, x); x \u2208 V } for every 1 \u2264 \u03b1 \u0338 = \u03b2 \u2264 |D|. 5 . Interdependent (or layered) networks [25, 34, 35 ]. An interdependent (or layered) network is a collection of different networks, the layers, whose nodes are interdependent to each other. In practice, nodes from one layer of the network depend on control nodes in a different layer. In this kind of representation, the dependencies are additional edges connecting the different layers. This structure, in between the network layers, is often called mesostructure. A preliminary study about interdependent networks was presented in Ref. [34] (there called layered networks). Similarly to the previous case of multidimensional networks, we can consider an interdependent (or layered) network as a multilayer network by identifying each network with a layer. 6. Multilevel networks [36] . The formal definition of a multilevel network is the following. Let G = (X, E) be a network. A multilevel network is a triple M = (X, E, S), where S = {S 1 , . . . , S p } is a family of subgraphs S j = (X j , E j ), j = 1, . . . , p of G such that",

However, these models are not able to combine the local scale with the global and the mesoscale structures of the system. For instance, if one wants to model how a rumor spreads within a social network, it is necessary to have in mind not only that different groups are linked through some of their members, but also that two people who know the same person do not necessarily know each other. In fact, these two people may very well belong to entirely different groups or levels. If one tries to model this situation with hypernetworks, then one only takes into account the social groups, and not the actual relationships between their members. In contrast, if one uses the hyperstructure model, then one cannot determine to which social group each contact between two nodes belongs. The key-point that makes hypernetworks and hyperstructures not the best mathematical model for systems with mesoscale structures is that they are both node-based models, while many real systems combine a node-based point of view with a link-based perspective.",

In other words, if there is a relationship between two people that share two distinct social groups, such as a work and a sporting environment, one has to specify if the relationship arises in the work place, or if it has a sport nature.

In a multidimensional network, a pair of entities may be linked by different kinds of links.

Each possible type of relation between two entities is considered as a particular dimension of the network. In the case of a multidimensional network model, a network is a labeled multigraph, that is, a graph where both nodes and edges are labeled and where there can exist two or more edges between two nodes.

Given the strong correlation between labels and dimensions, often the two terms are used interchangeably. In this model, a node u belongs to (or appears in) a given dimension d if u has at least one edge labeled with d. So, given a node u \u2208 V , n u is the number of dimensions in which u appears, i.e. n u = |{d \u2208 D; there is v \u2208 V s.t. (u, v, d) \u2208 E}| . (12) Similarly, given a pair of nodes u, v \u2208 V , n uv is the number of dimensions which label the edges between u and v, i.e. n uv = |{d \u2208 D; (u, v, d) \u2208 E}|. A multidimensional network can be considered as a multilayer network by making every label equivalent to a layer.",

For example, interdependent networks were used to study the interdependence of several real world infrastructure networks in Refs. [25, 35] , where the Authors also explore several properties of these structures such as cascading failures and percolation. Related to this concept, in Ref. [35] the Authors report the presence of a critical threshold in percolation processes, creating an analogy between interdependent networks and ideal gases. The main advantage of interdependent networks is their ability of mapping a node in one relation with many different nodes in another relation. Thus, the mesostructure can connect a single node in a network N 1 to several different nodes in a network N 2 . This is not possible in other models where there is no explicitly defined mesostructure, and therefore a node is a single, not divisible entity.",

            "text": "Multilevel networks [36] lie in between the multidimensional and the interdependent networks, as they extend both the classic complex network model and the hypergraph model [37] . Multilevel networks are completely equivalent (isomorphic) to multidimensional networks by considering a dimension d in conjunction with the equivalent slice S d . The set D corresponding to dimension d is the collection of edges labeled with the label d, i.e. D = {(u, v, x); x = d}, while S d is the collection of nodes and edges of relation d, i.e. all the u and v that are present in at least one edge labeled with d. In order to perform more advanced studies such as the shortest path detection, in Ref. [36] Authors introduced also a mesostructure called auxiliary graph. Every vertex of the multilevel network M is represented by a vertex in the auxiliary graph and, if a vertex in M belongs to two or more slice graphs in M, then it is duplicated as many times as the number of slice graphs it belongs to. Every edge of E is an edge in the auxiliary graph and there is one more (weighted) edge for each vertex duplication between the duplicated vertex and the original one. This operation breaks the isomorphism with multidimensional networks and brings this representation very close to a layered network [30] . However, these two models are not completely equivalent, since in the multilevel network the one-to-one correspondence of nodes in different slices is strict, while this condition does not hold for layered networks. In Ref. [36] , the Authors also define some extensions of classical network measures for multilevel networks, such as the slice clustering coefficient and the efficiency, as well as a collection of network random generators for multilevel structures.",

This concept also includes a mesostructure, called interslice couplings which connects a node of a specific slice S \u03b1 to its copy in another slice S \u03b2 . The mathematical formulation of multiplex networks has been recently developed through many works [23, 28, 45, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] 59, 60] . For instance, in Ref.

A more complex approach is to consider different degrees of importance (or influence) in different layers of the network, and to include this information in the definition of a matrix that defines the mutual influence between the layers. Thus, to calculate the importance of a node within a specific layer, one must take into account also all the other layers, as some of them may be highly relevant for the calculation. Consider, for instance, the case of a boss living in the same block of flats as one of his employees: the relationship between the two fellows within the condominium layer formed by all the neighbors has a totally different nature from that occurring inside the office layer, but the role of the boss (i.e. his centrality) in this case can be even bigger than if he was the only person from the office living in that block of flats.

In order to establish a relation between the clustering coefficients of the nodes in the multiplex network, C M (i), and the clustering coefficients of the nodes in the projected network, c proj(M) (i), we can use the same arguments employed in Ref.

[23] , the Authors point out the necessity of extending the notion of triangle to take into account the richness added by the presence of more than one layer. They define a 2-triangle as a triangle formed by an edge belonging to one layer and two edges belonging to a second layer. Similarly, a 3-triangle is a triangle which is composed by three edges all lying in different layers. In order to quantify the added value provided by the multiplex structure in terms of clustering, they consider two parameters of clustering interdependence, I 1 and I 2 . I 1 (I 2 ) is the ratio between the number of triangles in the multiplex which can be obtained only as 2-triangles (3-triangles) , and the number of triangles in the aggregated system. Then, I = I 1 + I 2 is the total fraction of triangles of the aggregated network which cannot be found entirely in one of the layers. They also define a 1-triad centered at node i, for instance j \u2212 i \u2212 k, as a triad in which both edge (j \u2212 i) and edge (i \u2212 k) are on the same layer. Similarly, a 2-triad is a triad whose two links belong to two different layers of the systems. This way, they establish two further definitions of clustering coefficient for multiplex networks. For each node i the clustering coefficient C i1 is the ratio between the number of 2-triangles with a vertex in i and the number of 1-triads centered in i. A second clustering coefficient C i2 is defined as the ratio between the number of 3-triangles with node i as a vertex, and the number of 2-triads centered in i. As the Authors point out, while C i1 is a suitable definition for multiplexes with M \u2265 2, C i2 can only be defined for systems composed of at least three layers, and both coefficients are poorly correlated, so it is necessary to use both clustering coefficients in order to properly quantify the abundance of triangles in multilayer networks. Averaging over all the nodes of the system, they obtain the network clustering coefficients C 1 and C 2 .",

Such differences are rooted in the new degrees of freedom that arise from interlayer connections, and are invisible to calculations of clustering coefficients on single-layer networks obtained via aggregation. Generalizing clustering coefficients for multiplex networks thus makes it possible to explore such phenomena and to gain deeper insights into different types of transitivity in networks.

If it is possible to find a path between any pair of its nodes, a multilayer network M is referred to as connected; otherwise it is called disconnected. However, different types of reachability may be considered [20, 23] depending, for example, on whether we are considering only the edges included in some layers. The length of a path is the number of edges of that path. Of course, in a multilayer network there are at least two types of edges, namely intralayer and interlayer edges. Thus, this definition changes depending on whether we consider interlayer and intralayer edges to be equivalent. Other metric definitions may be easily generalized from monolayer to multilayer networks. So, a geodesic between two nodes u and v in M is one of the shortest path that connects u and v. The distance d uv between u and v is the length of any geodesic between u and v. The maximum distance D(M) between any two vertices in M is called the diameter of M. By n uv we will denote the number of different geodesics that join u and v. If x is a node and \u2113 is a link, then n uv (x) and n uv (\u2113) will denote the number of geodesics that join the nodes u and v passing through x and \u2113 respectively.",

In addition to the spectra of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices, other types of spectral properties have been studied for multiplex network, such as the irreducibility [97] . Several problems in network theory involve the analysis not only of the eigenvalues, but also of the eigenvectors of a matrix [9] . This analysis typically includes the study of the existence and uniqueness of a positive and normalized eigenvector (Perron vector), whose existence is guaranteed if the corresponding matrix is irreducible (by using the classic Perron-Frobenius theorem). As for the spectral properties, it is possible to relate the irreducibility of such a matrix with the irreducibility in each layer and on the projection network. In Refs.

Modularity is a scalar that can be calculated for any partition of a network into disjoint sets of nodes.

The tensor product of two real vector spaces V and L, denoted by V \u2297 L, consists of finite linear combinations of v \u2297 w, where v \u2208 V and w \u2208 L. The dual vector space of a real vector space V is the vector space of linear functions f : V \u2212\u2192 R, indicated by V * . Denoting by Hom(V * , L) the set of linear functions from V * to L, there is a natural isomorphism between the linear spaces V \u2297 L and Hom(V * , L). Moreover, if V is a finite dimensional vector space, then there exists a natural isomorphism (depending on the bases considered) between the linear spaces V and V * . In fact, if V is finite-dimensional, the relationship between V and V * reflects in an abstract way the relation between the (1 \u00d7 N) row-vectors and the (N \u00d7 1) columnvectors of a (N \u00d7 N) matrix. However, if V and L are finite-dimensional, then we can identify the linear spaces V \u2297 L with Hom(V, L).

As a second example of multiplex network with significant overlap, consider the APS data set of citations and collaboration networks [113] . The two layers in this data set display significant overlap because two co-authors are also usually citing each other in their papers. One way to characterize the link overlap is by introducing the concept of multilinks [49, 113] . A multilink fully determines all the links present between any given two nodes i and j in the multiplex. Consider for example the multiplex with M = 2 layers, i.e. the duplex shown in Fig. 9 .

In Ref. [121] , the phase diagram of the model (see Fig. 14) has been completely characterized. The number of distinct degree classes |k| shown in panel (a) of Fig. 14 allows to define a region of parameter space corresponding to homogeneous degree distributions (region I a ), and another region corresponding to heterogeneous degree distributions (region I b ). The inverse partition ratio Y \u22121 2 of the degree distribution in a given layer shown in panel (b) of Fig. 14 provides evidence of a condensation occurring for \u03b1 + \u03b2 > 1 when \u03b2 \u2265 0, or for \u03b1 > 1 when \u03b2 < 0, in agreement with the theoretical derivations discussed in Ref. [121] . Finally, the Kendall \u03c4 correlation coefficient between the degrees of corresponding replica nodes shows that the model can display at the same time positive and negative degree-degree correlations in the two layers. Panel (d) of Fig. 14 shows the Kendall correlation coefficient \u03c4 (t) between the degree of corresponding replica nodes, calculated only over the nodes arrived at time t \u2032 < t. This last panel shows that for every \u03b2 < 0 the older nodes have always negatively correlated degrees in the two different layers. Therefore, in the region in which \u03c4 > 0 and \u03b2 < 0 shown in panel (c) of Fig. 14 , only the recently added nodes in the multiplex have positively correlated degrees, due to the stochastic nature in the model. Other growing multiplex network models have been proposed [36, 117] , where the multiplex network grows by the addition of an entire new layer at each time step. In Ref. [36] , two nodes i and j in the new layer are linked with a probability p ij that depends on the quantity there called node multiplexity Q ij . In particular, p ij can be either positively correlated with Q ij , or negatively correlated to it. In the first case two nodes that are active at the same time in many layers are more likely to be connected in the new layer, in the second case two nodes that are active at the same time in many layers have small probability to be connected in the new layer. In Ref. [117] , instead, every node i of the new layer will be active with a probability P i proportional to the activity of the node B i , i.e.,",

Fixing the degree sequence in each layer, one can use a configuration model to obtain a particular realization of the given set of connectivities. Of course, the full structural information in a multiplex includes also the connections between layers. In Refs. [48, 125] , the Authors have made the choice to add interlayer links arbitrarily. A different approach is to keep using a configuration model, but to specify the edges between the layers by means of a joint-degree distribution [56, 126, 127] . Note that, while the terms ''joint-degree sequence'', ''joint-degree matrix'' and ''joint-degree distribution'' are normally used in literature to indicate quantities related to the degrees of the nodes at the end of the links in a simple network, here they explicitly refer, instead, to multilayer connections [128] .",

A given set of constraints can give rise to a microcanonical network ensemble, satisfying the hard constraints, or to a canonical network ensemble in which the constraints are satisfied in average over the ensemble. The canonical network ensembles have been widely studied in the sociological literature under the name of exponential random graphs or p \u22c6 models [139] [140] [141] [142] , and recently studied by physicists [143] [144] [145] [146] [147] . The most popular examples of microcanonical network ensembles are the G(N, L) ensemble and the configuration model. The distinction between the canonical and microcanonical ensembles allows to draw a well defined parallelism [146] between such network ensembles and the classical ensembles in statistical mechanics where one considers system configurations compatible either with a fixed value of the energy (microcanonical ensembles) or with a fixed average of the energy determined by the thermal bath (canonical ensembles). For example, the G(N, L) random graphs formed by networks of N nodes and L links is an example of a microcanonical network ensemble, while the G(N, p) ensemble (where each pair of links is connected with probability p) is an example of canonical network ensemble since the number of links can fluctuate but has a fixed average given by \u27e8L\u27e9 = pN(N \u2212 1)/2. Despite this similarity, an ensemble that enforces an extensive number of hard constraints on its networks (such as the degree sequence) is not equivalent in the thermodynamic limit to the conjugated network ensemble enforcing the same constraints in average (such as the sequence of expected degrees). For instance, the ensemble of regular networks with degrees k i = c \u2200i = 1, 2, . . . , N is clearly not equivalent to the Poisson network in which every node has the same expected degreek i = c. The non-equivalence of microcanonical and canonical network ensembles with an extensive number of constraints needs also to be taken into account when characterizing dynamical processes on networks, because it can have relevant effects on their critical behavior.",

This is, actually, one important motivation that the scientific community has given to the observed SF degree distribution: both technological (e.g. the Internet) and biological networks (e.g. the protein-protein interaction and other biological networks in the cell) display a SF nature because they must be robust against random failures [157] [158] [159] [160] [161] [162] [163] .

Therefore, new aspects of the robustness of networks emerge when interdependencies are taken into account. Moreover, the impact of the topology of the interdependent networks on their robustness properties is also unexpected: in fact, in absence of correlations, interdependent SF networks are more fragile than Poisson networks when a constant average degree is kept [25] . When we consider multiplex networks or networks of networks with given supernetwork and links allowed only between replica nodes as described in Section 3.2.1, the system responds globally to the damage inflicted in a single layer. At any given time, either all the layers have a percolating cluster, or none of them has one [152] . When instead one considers a network of networks with given superdegree sequence as described in Section 3.2.2, layers with different number of interdependencies respond differently to the inflicted damage. In this latter case, the layers with higher number of interdependencies, i.e. with higher superdegree q \u03b1 , are more fragile than those with smaller superdegree [154] . Indeed, in these layers the percolation cluster disappears for a fraction of initial damaged nodes 1 \u2212 p smaller than the one that is necessary to disrupt layers with smaller number of interdependencies. Finally, if we consider a network of networks with fixed supernetwork and random permutations of the label of the nodes, as described in Section 3.2.3 one has to distinguish between the case in which the supernetwork is a tree, and that in which the supernetwork contains loops [26, 156] . If the supernetwork is a tree, all the layers start to percolate when the fraction of initially damaged nodes is less than 1 \u2212 p c , i.e. either all the layers percolate or none of them does [153] . In the case in which the supernetwork contains loops and the supernetwork is a random network with given superdegree distribution, the layers \u03b1 with higher superdegree q \u03b1 are more fragile than those with smaller superdegree. In this case the mutually connected component is described by the same equations derived for the network of networks described in Section 3.2.2 [154] .",

Assume that a group of nodes in layer A is damaged, all the nodes in the giant component of layer A are active while the nodes that are not in the giant component are not active. Then consider the layer B. All the nodes of layer B that are interdependent with nodes that are not active in layer A, are damaged. Next, set as active all the nodes that remain in the giant component of layer B, and set as not active all the nodes that are not in the giant component. By repeating the algorithm alternating the analysis of layer A and layer B, it is possible to characterize an avalanche of failure events that propagates from one layer to the other one, until the avalanche does not propagate any more. The set of active nodes that remains at the end of the iteration is the MCGC. Between any two nodes in this mutually connected component there are at least two paths, one in one layer A and one in layer B, that connect the two nodes and that pass only through nodes that belong to the mutually connected component. In this case, the MCGC is also called the viable cluster of the network [168] .",

This is in contrast with the theory of percolation in single-layer networks, where the giant component emerges continuously at a second order phase transition. Moreover, if one approaches the value p = p c , the interdependent networks are affected by cascading failures that propagate throughout the structure. Other works have extended the original formalism to network of networks [26, 153, 156] , network with partial interdependencies [35] with multiple dependencies links [169] and exploring the effect of targeted attack [170] . Subsequent studies on the subject have been carried out by Son et al. [171] . The Authors call this algorithm an ''epidemic spreading'' process, but the algorithm can be more suitably termed as the ''message passing algorithm'' for this generalized percolation problem [172] [173] [174] .

We furthermore call all the nodes (i, \u03b1) characterized by the same label i but belonging to different layers \u03b1 the ''replica nodes''. Every node (i, \u03b1) can be connected to nodes (j, \u03b1) within the same layer with ''connectivity links'', or with its ''replica nodes'' (i, \u03b2) in other layers with ''interdependency links''. In Ref. [169] , it is further allowed to one node in layer \u03b1 to be interdependent to more than one node in a given layer \u03b2, but here (if not explicitly otherwise stated) we make the simplifying assumption that every node in layer \u03b1 can be interdependent at most to a node in layer \u03b2, i.e. on its ''replica node''. This framework allows to treat at the same time, multiplex networks and networks of networks as described in Sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2. We define the network of networks with a supra-adjacency matrix of elements a i\u03b1,j\u03b2 = 1 if there is a link between node (i, \u03b1) and node (j, \u03b2) and zero otherwise.

Indeed, for SF networks of size N, the giant component emerges if the fraction of nodes that are not initially damaged p > p c with p c \u2192 0 as N \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, these networks continue to have the giant component also if most of the nodes are initially damaged. A finite percolation threshold in these networks is a finite size effect, i.e. the percolation threshold disappears in the limit N \u2192 \u221e. The situation is completely different for multiplex networks formed by interdependent SF networks [25] . The percolation threshold p = p c for the mutually connected component is finite also for multiplex networks formed by layers of SF networks [25] . In the case in which the layers of the multiplex have the same power-law degree distribution p(k) = Ck \u2212\u03b3 , the mutually connected component emerges discontinuously for p = p c as a hybrid phase transition with a square root singularity [25, 168] . In these networks, p c is not vanishing but remains finite as in the case of a multiplex in which the layers are formed by Poisson networks [25, 168] . In Fig. 23 we show the size of the mutually connected component for two SF networks with the same power-law exponent \u03b3 . As \u03b3 \u2192 2, and keeping the minimal degree constant, the discontinuity of S becomes smaller and smaller but is not vanishing as long as \u03b3 > 2. In",

This phenomenon reveals that the interdependent networks can be much more fragile than single-layer networks and are prone to abrupt cascading failures. In Ref.

In particular, p n indicates the fraction of non-damaged nodes in the network after n steps. In other words Ref.

The Authors investigated the maximal changes induced by the degree correlations for duplex with the same degree sequences, but either uncorrelated by the degree or maximally-positive correlated or maximallynegative correlated. For maximally-positive correlated multiplex networks, the percolation threshold p c is smaller than that for the maximally-negative correlated case. The networks with uncorrelated degrees in the different layers have a percolation threshold p c that is in between the previous two. In Fig. 29 the dependence of the fraction of nodes in the MCGC of correlated Poisson networks is shown as a function of the average degree of the nodes. In Ref.

For instance, infrastructures are mostly spatial and therefore it is essential to investigate the role of space in determining their robustness. Ref. [165] has shown that when the multiplex networks are embedded in real space, the interdependencies do not always sharpen the percolation transition. The topic is the subject of debate in the literature [166, 167] . Moreover, the nature of the percolation transition can depend on the typical distance in space of the interdependent nodes. In fact, by modulating the typical distance from two interdependent nodes, the transition can change from discontinuous (for large typical distances), to continuous (for typical distances lower than a threshold value) [188] . This model has been extended in several directions [189] [190] [191] . For example, in Ref. [189] partial interdependence was considered, and the Authors found that, in contrast to unembedded networks, for any fraction of dependency links the system collapses in an abrupt transition. Reference [190] tackled the problem of a network that recovers after each cascade. Furthermore, Ref. [191] studied the case of localized attack percolation in spatial networks.",

This is the case in which all the connections, either those between nodes in the same layer and those between nodes in different layers, have the same role and all the links are ''dependency links''. In particular, one can consider the giant component as a function of the fraction of damaged nodes in the multilayer structure. In the context of multilayer transportation systems, involving different means of communication such as buses, undergrounds, trains, etc., one station will be in the giant component if by following at least a path using any number of transportation systems, it is possible to reach a finite fraction of other stations. In this case, a node of the structure belongs to the giant component of the multiplex if at least one of its links connects the node to the giant component. This problem has been studied in Ref. [80] , considering the model of networks of networks described in Section 3.2.4, and graphically shown in Fig. 18 . Previously similar problems have been already addressed in the context of networks with different mixing patterns [192] , or epidemic spreading [75, 77] . As in the interdependent network case, the percolation threshold depends on the different types of degree correlations between the layers. Ref. [48] investigated and discussed also the role of targeted attacks of multiplex networks. Finally, in Ref. [193] the percolation transition has been characterized for a network in which each layer is a subgraph of some underlying network.",

Each node of the multiplex will then belong to the viable cluster of the resource network, if it is connected by at least one path to a resource node in each layer. The model displays discontinuity, bistability, and hysteresis in the fraction of viable nodes with respect to the density of networks and the fraction of resource nodes. The model can be used in the context of infrastructures, to show that the recovery from damage can also be extremely slow and difficult, due to hysteresis. In Ref. [197] the weak bootstrap percolation and the weak pruning percolation have been proposed. The weak bootstrap percolation describes the recovery of multiplex networks, while the weak pruning percolation describes the deactivation/damage propagating processes in a multiplex structure. While bootstrap percolation and pruning percolation on single-layers are equivalent, Ref. [197] shows that they do differ in the multiplex case. When layers are formed by Poisson networks, the weak bootstrap percolation includes both continuous and discontinuous transitions, while the weak pruning percolation has only a continuous transition when defined on a duplex, and a discontinuous hybrid transition when defined on a multiplex with 3 or more layers.",

In that work, it has been shown that moderately increasing the interlayer connectivity can reduce the size of the largest cascade in each layer, and it is therefore advantageous. Nevertheless, it has been shown that too much interconnections can become detrimental for the stability of the multilayer system because it allows single layers to inflict lager cascades to neighbor layers, and furthermore new interconnections increase the capacity and the total possible load, eventually generating larger cascades.",

[198] the role of multiplexity in the sandpile dynamics was further explored, showing that the avalanche size distribution is not affected by the multiplexity of the network. However, the detailed dynamics is affected by the multiplexity. For example, high-degree nodes in multiplex networks fail more often than in single-layer networks. In Ref. [50] cascades of adoption of a behavior, such as ideas or financial strategies, or movement to join, are studied with the Watts model [200] . It is shown that multiplexity can actually increase the network vulnerability to global cascades. This has relevance for advertising strategies that can become more effective with an increasing multiplexity, or for banks that might become more vulnerable with every new layer in the multiplex. In Ref. [201] a novel cascade model, inspired by the Watts threshold model, has been considered in which some nodes adopt a behavior once enough neighbors in all the layers have also adopted it, and some other nodes adopt the behavior only if enough neighbors in some layers do. This model can either inhibit or facilitate the cascade of events. Moreover, the model in some region of the phase space, allows for abrupt emergence of cascading events, revealing some novel mechanisms for the onset of avalanches that can be useful to characterize civil movements, or product adoption.",

In fact, given the symmetry of the Laplacian (181) , the solution of the linear system can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of L whose time evolution reads \u03c6 i (t) = \u03c6 i (0)e \u2212\u03bb i t . Thus, the diffusion time-scale, i.e. the time \u03c4 that the multiplex needs to relax to the stationary solution, is given by the inverse of the smallest non-zero eigenvalue of L that, for a connected multiplex, is the second eigenvalue (from the smallest \u03bb 1 = 0, to the largest one), that is \u03c4 = 1/\u03bb 2 . In Ref. [45] the Authors focused on the case of two layers, M = 2, and through perturbation limit they were able to relate the value of \u03bb 2 for the weak (D x \u226a 1) and strong (D x \u226b 1) interlayer coupling limits. In Ref. [45, 59] appears evident when looking at the strong coupling regime, D x \u226b 1.

Moreover, although not guaranteed, superdiffusion (i.e. the fact that the multiplex relaxes faster than any of its composing layers) is also possible.

One of the most successful applications of RWs to derive centrality measures is the well-known PageRank centrality method [84, 219] , which is at the core of the most widely-used search engine of the World-Wide-Web, Google. PageRank is based on a diffusion process that mimics the navigation through webpages as the motion of a random walker following hyperlink pathways. Whereas these link-by-link hops are followed most of the times, there is a small probability r that at a given time step the walker performs a long distance hop to an arbitrary node of the system. In this case, the transitions encoded in In Ref. [54] , Halu et al. proposed a different version of the PageRank dynamics that is not as general as the above in the sense that there is a privileged layer that influence the remaining layers of the multiplex. In the case of a 2-layer multiplex, the nodes in the first one are characterized by means of the usual PageRank on single-layer networks, whereas the transitions between adjacent nodes of the second layer are biased by the centrality of their counterparts in the first layer.",

In this context, the problem of congestion arises when the so-called capacity of nodes is limited, i.e. the number of packets that a node can send to its neighbors per unit time is bounded. However, in a time step, it may occur that a node receives more packets than its capacity. When this event happens for a macroscopic part of the system, congestion shows up.",

In fact, the second layer is composed of a subset of nodes of the first one so that each node in the second layer is directly connected with its representation in the first network. Origin and destinations can be only chosen in the first (large) layer so that, given that the agents travel following the shortest path, when networks are uncoupled the agents do not make use of the second platform. However, coupling enters into play when the diffusion of agents between adjacent nodes is faster in the second of the layers. In this case, agents may find short paths between their origin and destination making use of the second layer. To account for this coupling, the Authors measure the coupling between layers as",

In fact, as \u03bb increases, the average distance between two nodes in the first layer decreases as an effect of the use of the second layer. However, this effect comes together with the accumulation of the used paths on a very small subset of edges which can lead to a saturation of the system due to congestion. This latter effect is shown by measuring the Gene coefficient G \u2208 [0, 1] that accounts for the distribution of paths across the edges, so that small (large) values of G correspond to a spread (concentrated) distribution of the flows across the edges (see Fig. 34 ).

Moreover, in Ref.

In addition, the study of the spreading of infectious diseases on top of networks gives also insight on other dynamical processes of interest, such as the information and rumor spreading in social networks.

The case of interconnected networks considers the spreading of a disease in several network layers, each node of each network representing a different agent. One example is the case of sexually transmitted diseases. Just think of three networks of sexual contacts: one composed of agents sharing heterosexual relationships, and two other graphs of homosexual (gay and lesbian) contacts. These three networks are connected through edges in which one (or both) of the connected nodes is a bisexual agent. Obviously, the values of the parameters describing the spreading dynamics, such as the infection rates, depend in principle on the nature of the link through which the contagion is produced. In this setting, the key question is to relate the epidemic onset of the whole system with those corresponding to the isolated networks.",

The particular setting of multiplex networks provides the best suited structural backbone for the study of the dynamical interplay between different dynamical processes taking place within the same set of nodes. In this way, multiplexity offers the possibility of incorporating different network layers for each dynamical process at work. This possibility leads to approach a well studied problem in single-layer networks: the competition between the spreading of two different diseases. In Ref. [249] , Newman proposed a model in which two consecutive SIR diseases spread within a single-layer network. For the first disease at work, the critical properties and the diffusion of the infections remain the same, as usual. However, the second disease finds it more difficult to spread since those agents recovered from the first of the diseases gain immunity also to the second one. The main result is that, even for SF networks, the epidemic threshold for the coexistence of both diseases is larger than zero. Subsequently, other works extended the framework to the case of simultaneous spreading of diseases [250] , or to the SIS model [251] .",

To this end, they considered a multiplex composed of two networks and a SIR model so that the first spreading takes place in one of the networks leaving a set of recovered nodes. These nodes are also set as recovered in the second layer (as if they were fully immunized) prior to the second spreading that takes place in this second layer. The main result is that a positive correlation between the degrees of the nodes in both layers enhances the immunization of the network to the second spreading (increasing the effective epidemic threshold for the coexistence of two epidemics). This approach has been generalized in Ref.

As mentioned above, the multiplex structure allows to couple different dynamical processes involving the same set of agents being, in principle, different the structural backbone on top of which each process operates. In this way, disease spreading has been recently coupled to social dynamics [256] , in order to take into account how the social awareness about the spreading of a disease can influence the impact of the latter. To this aim, the Authors coupled the SIS spreading taking place on a physical network with another compartmental stochastic model in which the state of the agents can be of two kinds: Aware (A) and Unaware (U). The first dynamics is completely characterized by the usual two parameters: the transmission, \u03b2, and recovery, \u00b5, rates. The second dynamics takes place on the second layer (a kind of virtual network in which information about the epidemic flows) and the transition between states A and U is analogous to that in the SIS model: the direct contact of an A agent with another one in U produces two A agents with probability \u03bb, whereas an aware individual can become unaware with probability \u03b4. The coupling between the two dynamical models is done by reducing the transmission rates from infected individuals to aware and susceptible ones by a factor \u03b3 (\u03b3 = 0 means that aware individuals become fully immunized). In addition, the state unaware-infected is not admitted and, in a time discrete-version, it becomes aware-infected with probability 1 (if not recovered). As in Ref. [252] , when isolated, the two dynamical processes display a critical point at some values of the respective control parameters, \u03b2/\u00b5 and \u03bb/\u03b4. In particular: \u03b2 c = \u00b5/\u039b(A 1 ) and \u03bb c = \u03b4/\u039b(A 2 ), where A 1 and A 2 are the adjacency matrices of the first layer where SIS and Aware-Unaware dynamics take place respectively. Once again, the coexistence of these processes changes the onset of the epidemic state. In particular, when the infection rate of the SIS dynamics is large enough, the infected agents trigger the mechanism of awareness in the virtual layer, thus lowering the incidence of the disease and increasing the epidemic onset. This result is shown in Fig. 38 for several values of \u00b5 and \u03b4. Interestingly, as the ratio \u03b4/\u00b5 decreases, the value of the epidemic onset is more influenced by the Aware-Unaware dynamics.",

The first viewpoint comes from the investigation of coupling density, which tries to reproduce the empirical fact that not all the nodes are present on each layer of social networks. In Ref. [257] , a fraction q of nodes are shared by two layers enabling to form partially overlapped networks. Since there exists the same disease in both layers, the equal transmission probability is assumed, whereas the spreading of infection starts from one random node. The main aim becomes here to explore the effect of the overlapping fraction q on the disease propagation with reference to the SIR dynamics model. Based on the theoretical analysis and simulations, the Authors found that the epidemic threshold of multiplex networks depends on both topology and the coupling density. In the limit of q \u2192 1, the epidemic threshold is minimum, and both layers have the identical ratio of recovered nodes at any transmission probability. This is because nearly each node belongs to two layers at the same time.",

Moreover, the Authors defined two new measures to evaluate the influence of interlayer links. The first is the degree-degree correlation (DDC) between layers: positive (negative) values indicate that high (low) degree nodes are inclined to have more (less) connections within another layer. The other quantity is the average similarity of neighbors (ASN) from different layers of nodes, which measures how many joint neighbors one node possesses in both layers. The Authors found that, even if both layers are below their respective thresholds, the disease can still propagate across the multiplex system. If the value of DDC is larger, a lower disease threshold and a smaller outbreak size are supported. The epidemic threshold and disease size keep both robust against the change of ASN.",

Among several existing control measures, vaccination attracts the hugest attention from theoretical and experimental perspectives [273] [274] [275] [276] . During the seasons of disease spreading, the high risk of infection usually stimulates individual vaccination enthusiasm, while high expenses or side effects of a vaccine may lead to the opposite case. Thus, individuals face a dilemma: to vaccinate or not, both of which ways can be managed as two basic strategies with respective cost functions. To resolve this dilemma, game theory has been integrated into individual decisionmaking processes, where nodes hold the prevention strategy according to risk and expenses in the epidemic campaign [277] . In a recent research [278] , where nodes are only allowed to make rational selection (i.e. taking vaccination only if its expense is low), the Authors found that disease outbreak can be more effectively inhibited on SF networks than on random networks. Compared with early theoretical predictions of disease thresholds [239] , this interesting outcome indicates that voluntary vaccination can effectively control the spreading of diseases in real-world networks. Similarly, when the imitation dynamics with noise replaces the deterministic rule in the disease-behavior study, multiple effects spontaneously arise: for perfect vaccine, vaccination behavior of SF networks beats that of random networks, while imperfect vaccine enables the promotion of vaccination and eradication of disease to act better on homogeneous connectivity patterns [279] . In Ref. [280] it is found that the spatial population structure shows a ''double-edged sword'' effect, which fosters vaccine uptake at the low cost of vaccination, but causes vaccination to plummet when the cost goes beyond a certain threshold. More specifically, if a small fraction of individuals consistently holds vaccinating in flu-like diseases, these committed vaccinators can efficiently avoid the clustering of susceptible individuals and stimulate other imitators to take vaccination, thus contributing to the promotion of vaccine uptake [281] .",

Under such a framework, one network is regarded as the infection network to transmit diseases, and the remaining communication network channels individual influence concerning preventive behavior. Moreover, at variance from the aforementioned case where vaccination is the principal measure on single networks, other prevention behaviors, such as wearing facemasks, washing hands frequently, taking pharmaceutical drugs, and avoiding contact with sick people, are considered as the main strategies, which seem particularly reasonable before attaining effective vaccine [283] .",

Fig. 39 shows that, as preventive behavior protects a certain people from being infected, the threshold and peak of disease outbreak are effectively suppressed in the new embedded scenario.

Under such a disease-behavior system, biological contagion spreads on one layer, while the main control measure, vaccination, is carried out in the social network. At variance with the case of an isolated network, the Authors suggested that the resulting coupling can bring positive or negative impact on the vaccination coverage during a vaccine scare, i.e. accelerating or decelerating the elimination of disease, which can get support from the empirical examples. Due to the variety of factors on the social layer, the epidemic trajectories and the uptake of control measures can also change to a large extent. Moreover, inspired by these findings, the Authors suggested that the coupled diseasebehavior model, which gets empirical validation, can be used as a predictive tool to explore the optimal strategies for public health.",

To elucidate this issue, dozens of experimental and theoretical frameworks have been proposed from viewpoints of statistical physics, economics and sociology [227, [286] [287] [288] [289] . Opinion formation dynamics, as one simple and paradigmatic dynamical process, has attracted particular attention. Up to now, various spin-like setups have been put forward to study the evolution of opinion dynamics, which include the Sznajd model [290] , majority rule model [291, 292] , bounded confidence model [288, 293] , and voter model [294, 295] , to name but a few.

At each time step, an agent i is chosen along with one of its neighbors j and s i = s j , i.e., the agent adopts the opinion of the neighbor. In this sense, the transition rate of individual opinion is proportional to the fraction of neighboring nodes in the opposite state. The dynamical process is repeated until the states with all sites equal (consensus) are absorbing. In spite of being extremely simple, the voter model produces rich dynamical behaviors [295, 297] , especially from the angles of spatial interaction. In one-dimensional lattices, the dynamics is exactly the same as the zero-temperature Glauber dynamics [298] . Turning to two-dimensional lattices, the growth of domains can makes the interfaces quite rough, at odds with usual coarsening systems [299] . Moreover, a series of extended versions, such as the vacillating voter model [300] , nonlinear voter model [301] , heterogeneous voter model [302] , and constrained voter model [303] have also been suggested. In the following we will present more details on the voter model.",

In this sense, the ordering dynamics of voter model should not be exceptional. If employing one complete graph, the mean consensus time \u27e8T \u27e9 can be easily obtained by using the Fokker-Planck equation [304] . The consideration of a heterogeneous connectivity can make the mean consensus time \u27e8T \u27e9 to become closely related with the structural network details. On SF networks with exponent \u03b3 , direct voter model makes \u27e8T \u27e9 to scale as the size N of the network for \u03b3 > 3 and sublinearly for \u03b3 \u2264 3 [296, 305, 306] . Non trivial relationships between \u27e8T \u27e9 and N are also found in other versions of the voter model as in Ref. [307] . For small-world networks, the plateau formed by active interfaces hinders the diffusion of opinions, so that the consensus eventually relies on the linear system size [308, 309] . Along this research line, Zschaler et al. recently examined the effect of directed networks on the order-disorder transition [310] . The impact of other spatial mechanisms, such as social influence and heterogeneous beliefs, are also of particular evidence [311, 312] .",

            "text": "At variance with the aforementioned processes on static networks or in a Markovian memoryless fashion, coevolution voter model has also been duly studied. We first focus on non-Markovian patterns. In recent researches [314, 315] , Stark et al. explored the effect of a memory-dependent transition rate, which is determined by the persistence time of individual current opinion. The longer a voter keeps its opinion, the less probable is that it switches the status in the long run. The Authors found that the process toward reaching a macroscopic consensus was accelerated by slowing down the microscopic dynamics. Looking at another recent report [313] , where individual ability q of opinion switching is weakened during a freezing period H, the Authors revealed that an intermediate freezing period can lead to the fastest consensus, i.e. to the smallest \u27e8T \u27e9. The essence of this accelerated consensus is attributed to the biased random walk of the interface between adjacent opinion clusters (as shown in Fig. 40 ). Moreover, it is worth checking how the dynamical topology affects the diffusion of opinions. Under such a framework, an agent can adjust its connections with a probability (otherwise it updates its opinion). The state of the system on coevolving networks can be characterized by the interface density \u03c1 quantifying the fraction of edges linking nodes with different states (active links). When \u03c1 = 0 the system is in the active phase, while for \u03c1 \u0338 = 0 it keeps the frozen phase. Based on the mean-field approximation approach, Ref. [316] revealed that the competition between opinion imitation and the rewiring links drives a fragmentation transition from the active to the frozen phase.",

For low-dimension networks, this type of agent can influence the selection of all the agents, and lead to the general consensus in the form of its own opinion. However, once higher-dimension networks are considered it becomes rather difficult to inspire the consensus in the whole system, but the ''zealot'' just induces a partial bias in the local neighborhood [302, 318, 319] . In addition, the voter model has also been applied to biological and ecological problems, where people try to protect the diversity of species and fixation in the evolution of competing species [320, 321] .",

One potential approach is to create interlayer links, through which opinions can be exchanged between different networks. In a recent research [322] , the Author considered the case of a two-clique graph, which is composed of 2 cliques interconnected by m interlayer links. If the size of both cliques is N, each node has m/N interlayer links on average. These links are either regularly placed, or distributed at full random. expectation of a complete graph [307] . However, once the number of interlayer links per node is much smaller than unity, the mean consensus time is \u27e8T \u27e9 = O(N 2 ), i.e. the system attains the slow consensus regime. The crossover between these two regimes takes places at approximately one interlayer link per node, as shown in Fig. 41 . Thus, these results suggest that the sparse interlayer connections between two networks extremely decelerate the ordering state for the voter model dynamics.",

The case p 1 = p 2 preserves the symmetric multilayer setup, namely, the time scales are the same in both layers. At variance, for p 1 \u0338 = p 2 , an asymmetric multilayer case takes place, namely, different topological time scales characterize the two layers. In the symmetric case, the Authors found that interlayer connectivity plays a critical role in determining the state transition of systems. Once again, the absorbing fragmentation transition appears at a certain threshold value of p l . Moving to the asymmetric case, the Authors unveiled an anomalous shattered fragmentation transition, where the layer dynamics splits into many isolated components possessing different opinions, namely an explosive growth of the number of disconnected components. Moreover, Ref. [323] also identified the critical degree of interlayer connectivity to stop the fragmentation of one layer by coupling it to another layer that has no fragments. Finally, it is interesting to consider the application of opinion dynamics in the multiplex perspective. In a recent research [324] a simple model of opinion formation dynamics is proposed to describe the parties competing for votes within a political election. At variance with previous setups of voter model [286, 296] , each opinion or party is modeled here as one social network where the contagion dynamics takes place. Every agent, at the election day, can choose either to be active in only one of the two networks (vote for one party) or to be inactive, namely, not to vote on both networks. Based on the simulated annealing algorithm, the Authors showed a rich phase diagram. In a wide region of the phase diagram, the competition between the two parties allows for the emergence of pluralism, namely two antagonistic parties gather a finite share of the total votes. The densely connected network usually wins the election campaign, regardless of the initial distribution. Nevertheless, small perturbations could break the existing equilibrium, and a small minority of committed agents can alter the election outcome, which is consistent with recent claims [325] .",

However, cooperation is hampered by the players' ''Temptation'' to defect, since defecting against a cooperator yields more payoff than cooperating (T = b > 1), and by the risk arising from cooperating with a defector, as it yields the lowest payoff, usually called ''Suckers'', (S = 0) [337] . These payoffs satisfy the ranking T > R > P \u2265 S. The social dilemma is thus established, since mutual cooperation yields both an individual and total benefit higher than that of mutual defection. The pairwise nature of the game is translated to a population scale by making the agents interacting (playing) with each other, and accumulating the payoff obtained from each interaction. After each round of the game, the strategies of the agents are updated so that those agents with less payoff are tempted to copy (replicate) the strategy of those fittest individuals. In unstructured populations, in which players are well-mixed, evolutionary dynamics leads all the individuals to defection [338, 339] . However, the existence of a network of interactions, so that each agent can only play with those directly connected to it, the population can sometimes promote the emergence of cooperation. This mechanism promoting cooperation was coined as network reciprocity [340] , and it was observed to be substantially enhanced when the network substrate is SF [341, 342] .",

This latter change turns the PDG into a Snowdrift game (SDG). In this way, the exploitation that defectors make of cooperators, regardless of the layer where they are located, is hampered by the payoff loss when meeting a defector belonging to the other network layer. The results in Ref. [349] reveal that, both for well-mixed layers and networked ones, it is possible to find polarized states in which cooperation dominates in one of the layers whereas defection does in the other. Fig. 42 shows the fraction of cooperators, c, as a function of the Temptation b. When there are no connections between network layers (p = 0), so that the two populations play a PDG, the diagram follows the usual trend in single-layer networks: cooperation resists for small values of b > 1 and then suddenly decreases so that c = 0 for b \u226b 1. However, polarized states (here revealed by the plateau at c = 0.5) appear as soon as the two layers are connected, i.e. even for a small number of interlayer links, thus showing the importance that the interconnection between layers has on the evolutionary outcome.",

In this regime, it was found that those agents connecting the two network layers are more likely to cooperate than those sharing only intralayer links.

In a recent research [351] , where PDG and SDG are respectively implemented on different layers, a biased imitation is proposed: a node with probability p can mimic the strategy of intralayer neighbor in the same network, otherwise the internetwork neighbor is chosen as the strategy donor. Under such a framework, the Authors try to explore how the cooperation trait varies as a function of a biased probability p. The biased probability unveils a multiple effect, which is robust against the change of population structures. A slight decline of the biased probability starting from p = 1 promotes the cooperation behavior in the PDG layer. On the contrary, this decrease impairs the evolution of cooperation in the SDG subpopulation. Ref. [351] also verifies that qualitatively valid observations can be extended to a much broader parameter space in virtue of the mean-field method. The population 1 (of size N 1 = 10 3 ) has been coupled to a smaller population 2 (N 2 = 10 2 ). While initial strategies in population 1 are equally probable (random initial conditions), the population 2 starts from the absorbent state of fully defection.

It is worth mentioning that this form possesses evident differences with the aforegoing situations. As compared to the case of interconnected networks, the direct interaction of game and strategy exchanged between network layers are strictly forbidden. On the other hand, the corresponding nodes connected via the internetwork links represent different agents, at variance with the multiplex scenario, thus both the accumulation of payoff and strategy updating are just limited to the same network layer. In this sense, the internetwork links are mainly used to create mutual influence between different networks. Since utility and strategy are prime elements in evolutionary game theory, creating interdependence through both factors becomes a natural choice. The framework of interdependent network games is then the following: agents of each layer do not engage in any game interaction beyond their own layer, but just refer utility or strategy information of other systems during the process of strategy updating with their intranetwork neighbors.",

As usual, the utility function is used for updating the strategies of the nodes in each layer. The most interesting result obtained in Ref. [355] is that, when one layer almost dominates the other, cooperation is extraordinarily favored in the slave layer. For \u03b3 \u2192 0 and \u03b3 \u2192 1, the corresponding master layer behaves almost equally to an isolated square lattice showing more weakness to defection than the slave one, in which the relation between the strategy and the utility function is almost random. These results are explained in terms of time-scale separation for the spread of strategies that favors the development of cooperator clusters in the slave layer. Many other kinds of interlayer couplings can be introduced in the utility function. In Ref. [356] , using a two-layer topology composed of two identical 2-dimensional lattices, the Authors followed a similar approach to that used in Ref. [354] for the PDG, since each one of the layers has its own utility function, which in its turn depends on what is the state of the other layer.

The effect of the coupling parameters \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2032 is the promotion of cooperation although this effect is more pronounced for \u03b3 than for the interlayer coupling \u03b3 \u2032 (see the left panel of Fig. 45 ). This observation was given the name of interdependent network reciprocity. The essence of this mechanism requires the simultaneous formation of correlated cooperator clusters on both networks, which can get further support from the synchronized evolution of strategy pairs between networks, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 45 . If synchronization does not emerge or if the coordination process is disturbed, interdependent network reciprocity fails, resulting in the total collapse of cooperation. Moreover, this promoting effect is proven to take place also in systems involving more than 2 layers, as long as the coordination between the networks is not disturbed. Another way to model the interlayer coupling via the utility function is the probabilistic interconnection introduced in Ref. [357] , in which two lattices are coupled in an interconnected way. However, two nodes of both layers are effectively coupled with probability p, so that not all the possible N pairs of interlayer links are active. When an interlayer link is active, the utility function of player i in layer \u03b1 is influenced, so that apart from the 5 PGG in which it is enrolled within the corresponding layer \u03b1, it also participates in that centered on its partner i \u2032 in the other layer \u03b2. In this way, the Authors showed that there is an optimal interlayer connection probability p that maximizes the cooperation level.",

The coupling is done via the update rule by which the agents decide their strategies (to cooperate or to defect) for the next round of the game instead that via the utility function. The probability that agent i in layer \u03b1 adopts the strategy of a neighboring node j in the same layer depends here on the difference between their payoff functions and on the fact that the corresponding partner of i in layer \u03b2 has the same or a different strategy. If the strategies of both the node i and its partner i \u2032 are the same, the probability of changing is decreased with respect to the usual one when the network layers are isolated. This coupling is seen not only to enhance cooperation in both PDG and PGG, but also to sustain the spontaneous emergence of correlated behaviors between the two networks.

The Authors found that an intermediate density of sufficiently strong coupling between networks (more accurately, \u03b3 \u2192 1 and \u03c1 \u2243 0.5) warrants an optimal regime for cooperation to survive. This observation is robust to the variations of the strategy updating dynamics, the interaction topology, and the governing social dilemma, thus suggesting a high degree of universality. Similarly to Ref. [350] it is observed that, within a layer, cooperation tends to fixate preferentially in those nodes that are connected with their counterpart in the other layer (see Fig. 46 ). Furthermore, it is instructive to examine how the cooperative behavior survives on the coevolution framework, in which the heterogeneity is usually ubiquitous [360, 361] . In a recent research [362] , where no interlayer links exist between two independent structured populations, a utility threshold is designed to manage the emergence of temporary interlayer links. If the current utility of node i exceeds this threshold, it is rewarded by one interlayer link to the corresponding partner belonging to the other network in the next time step; otherwise the external link is not formed. As for the evaluation of utility, Eq. (231) is retained. It is easy to estimate that, as long as the utility of all nodes drops below the threshold, the external link is terminated, which returns to decoupled single-layer networks. The Authors showed that an intermediate threshold gives rise to distinguished players that act as strong catalysts of cooperative behavior in both PDG and PGG. However, there also exist critical utility thresholds beyond which distinguished players are no longer able to percolate. The interdependence between the two populations then vanishes, and the survival of cooperation becomes a hard task. Finally, this demonstration of the spontaneous emergence of optimal interdependence by means of a simple coevolutionary rule based on the self-organization of reward and fitness is proven to be universally effective on different interaction networks.",

It is important to remark that detailed studies of the latter case actually started much before the relatively recent introduction of the concept of multilayer networks. In particular, a widely studied case is the limit of the so-called blinking networks [378, 379] , where the switching between different configurations happens rapidly, i.e. with a characteristic time scale much shorter than that of the networked system's dynamics. Under these conditions, it was found that synchronous motion can be established for sufficiently rapid switching times even in the case where each visited wiring configuration (each network layer) would prevent synchronization under static conditions. Yet, the limit of blinking networks is not a suitable framework for an adequate description of several natural phenomena. For instance, modeling processes such as mutations in biological systems [380] , or adaptations in social systems or financial market dynamics [381] would demand the very opposite limit of time-varying networks whose structure evolution takes place over characteristic time scales that are commensurate with, or even secular with respect to, those of the nodes' dynamics.",

The method is based on starting from a given layer graph G 0 , and producing a large set of different realizations of the same graph. This allows the estimation of the initial distribution p(\u03bb 0 ) of the non-vanishing eigenvalues of the set. Then, one can directly construct \u039b(t) to use in Eq. (236) by randomly drawing a set of eigenvalues either according to p(\u03bb 0 ), or uniformly between \u03bb 2 (0) and \u03bb N (0). The former approach can be implemented either by using the spectrum of a different realization of G 0 (the so-called eigenvalue surrogate method [383] ), or by extracting directly the eigenvalues from the distribution p(\u03bb 0 ). The latter method, instead, simply corresponds to the random selection of the eigenvalues from a uniform distribution.

Table 5 summarizes the behavior of these quantities for the different eigenvalue selection strategies described above. The initial layer G 0 is the Laplacian matrix of a scale-free (SF) network grown using the preferential attachment algorithm [385] , and whose strength distribution follows a power-law P(s) \u223c s \u2212\u03b3 . Fig. 47 illustrates the strength distributions of the network layers constructed with different methods. It is evident that the eigenvalue surrogate method, as well as the ordered selection of eigenvalues from the initial distribution p(\u03bb 0 ), do not change the SF character of the strength distribution (thick red and dashed blue lines in panel a). At the same time, they yield values for \u27e8s\u27e9 = \ued71 {s} sP(s), \u27e8C\u27e9 and \u27e8\u2113\u27e9 that deviate only slightly from those of the original graph (see Table 5 ). This indicates that both methods are convenient strategies to construct a commuting set of layers through which the evolution of the graph substantially preserves all the main topological features of the initial condition. Conversely, choosing the eigenvalues from a uniform distribution, either in an ordered or in a unordered way, produces layers that completely destroy the original SF strength distribution (thick red solid line and dashed blue line in panel b). These correspond to structural configurations for which each measured quantity wildly differs from its value in G 0 . Finally, the intermediate solution of choosing the eigenvalue spectrum from the initial p(\u03bb 0 ) in a unordered way, while still preserving the power-law tail of the strength distribution (solid black line in panel b), still changes substantially the topological structure of the underlying network.

To allow for heterogeneity at the population level, each population has its own frequency distribution. In addition, the system is heterogeneous at the coupling level, as the model explicitly considers the possibility to specify separately the coupling strengths between the members of different populations.

[396] considers different topologies, such as random (ER), random regular (RR), small-world (SW) and scale-free (SF), and studies a 2-layered multiplex network formed by interconnecting a layer with ER, SW or SF structure with another layer with an RR structure. This choice of the global topology is motivated by its correspondence to the highest synchronizability. The links between the layers have a constant weight c. The inspection of the eigenratio \u03bb N /\u03bb 2 allows to draw non-trivial and interesting conclusions for the synchronization properties. In particular, it is shown that a SW-RR topology enhances the synchronization, even though individually the SF topology has a lower eigenratio and a better synchronizability than the SW topology. In addition, it is shown that the ER-RR configuration displays similar synchronization properties to the SW-RR configuration for small coupling strengths, whereas at large coupling strengths the ER-RR configuration leads to a synchronization scenario similar to that occurring for the SF-RR configuration.",

Multicenter layer networks are characterized by the presence in each layer of nodes with special properties, called center nodes. Each layer is considered adjacent to the layer immediately preceding it and the one immediately following it; the exceptions are the first layer, which is only adjacent to the second, and the last, which is only adjacent to the previous one. All center nodes in a layer are not connected among them (except for the first layer in which they are globally connected) but to all the center nodes in the adjacent layers.

The legend contains the symbol codes for the specific topologies considered, as well as for the specific ranking used for the targeting. All results correspond to ensemble averages over 40 different graph realizations, and, for the random ranking case over 40 different ranking realizations. improvement in SF networks is much more evident than in the ER case, indicating that the dynamics of heterogeneous structures, like the ones encountered in real-world networks, are much easier to be manipulated and targeted.",

Notice that this three-layer structure contains information that, in modern complex network theory, would be synthesized into a single directed network, as the third layer is the complementary of the second. Using this network as a test bed, they proposed a method for detecting blocks that are coherent across the different layers: in other words, they had just introduced the first community detection algorithm. Along this line of research, Greiger and Pattison in Ref. [467] analyzed the multilayer social structure reported in Ref. [468] , characterized by business and marriage relationships between important families from Florence in the fifteenth century. Authors showed how a personal hierarchy, comprising information from both layers, can be used to create meaningful partitions of the graph.",

[63] extracted a six-layers structure, respectively representing friendship or enmity relations between pairs of players, private messages exchange, trading activities, the presence of one-to-one aggressive acts, and placing head money (bounties) on other players. Different characteristics were found for each layer: specifically, negatively connoted (i.e. aggressive) actions are characterized by power-law topologies, while positive ones exhibit a higher clustering coefficient. Furthermore, different layers interact in a non-trivial way: for instance, there is a strong overlap between communication and friendship networks, but also between communication and aggression, and between communication and friendship -see Fig. 51 . Ref. [419] expands further those results, by considering the time evolution of such a multilayer network. The network dynamics follows some well-known processes, like triadic closure and network densification. Furthermore, it seems that the Dunbar conjecture is confirmed [471] , as out-degrees are limited at around 150 connections. More recently, the effect of the user's gender was tackled in Ref. [420] , demonstrating that the structural properties of the layers are different for men and women, especially when the interaction time scale is considered.",

Specifically, the initial bipartite network (users can only be connected to movies) is projected into a movie's network, i.e. where nodes represent movies, pairwise connected when a single user rated both of them. Furthermore, information about ratings has been used to organize links in three different layers: positive, negative and mixed ratings. The resulting three layers have different characteristics, which are lost when the global projection is considered. For instance, positive and negative networks display a high clustering coefficient, indicating that users tend to like (or dislike) groups of similar movies; on the other hand, mixed ratings create more heterogeneous structures, characterized by larger but sparser communities.",

Also, there is a strong bidirectionality in social relations: if a user comments on the photo of another user, the latter reciprocates by commenting a photo of the former person. It is worth noticing that these results, and especially the relationship between social and semantic connections, could not be inferred if all layers were collapsed into a single-layer network.

Yet, higher levels of interconnectivity have a negative impact, both because they open pathways for neighboring networks to inflict large cascades, and because new interconnections increase capacity and total possible load, which fuels even larger cascades. In the same spirit, Ref.

Firstly because connections between different nodes, e.g. direct flights or trains, are explicit, that is, their existence is published, requiring little effort for the network construction. Secondly, because transportation systems are usually interconnected, with a multilayer approach Fig. 52 . Example of a space-based network. The two light gray boxes represent two spacecrafts, connected through a high-capacity communication system. Each one of them is composed of different modules, e.g. the Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TTC): when one of them fails, the corresponding spacecraft can rely on the other to backup that function, and to fulfill its mission.

This latter aspect, i.e. the multimodal nature of transportation, has been tackled in two recent papers. In the first one, a two-layer structure has been created by merging the world wide port and airport networks [184] , with the aim of studying the global robustness against random attacks. While previous studies have considered the resilience of coupled systems when such a coupling was of a random nature [25, 35] , there Authors focused on the level of similarity between layers, given for instance the fact that well-connected airports are more connected to central ports. Such a similarity is assessed by means of two metrics, namely, the inter degree-degree correlation and the interclustering coefficient. Simulations executed using the topology of such a transportation system reveal that, as the networks become more intersimilar, the system becomes significantly more robust to random failure, as one network is able to back-up the other, when needed.",

It is worth noticing that both networks have a very different nature. While the airport network is small (with 78 nodes) and presents a scale-free disassortative structure, the rail one is much larger (6.769 stations) and has a topology strongly constrained by the geography, implying a narrow degree distribution and an assortative topology.

For instance, Ref. [446] analyzed the network created by worldwide cargo ship movements; while the 90% of world trade is carried by sea, it is noteworthy that little attention has been devoted to this transportation mode from the field of complex networks. The multilayer structure is given by the three most common classes of cargo ships, i.e. container ships, bulk dry carriers and oil tankers, which usually connect different ports and travel following different patterns. For instance, bulk dry carriers and oil tankers tend to move in a less regular manner between ports than container ships. The understanding of the specific patterns of movement created by each type of ship, instead of analyzing the topological projection of this multilayer network, is motivated by the problem of invasive species spreading: bulk dry carriers and oil tankers often sail empty, thus exchanging large quantities of ballast water and favoring the spreading process.",

            "text": "Finally, the air transport network [19] has also been studied alone, but taking into account the multilayer structure created by different airlines. As demonstrated in Ref. [78] , the global network is the result of the interactions between two main types of layers: those created by major airlines on the one side, and those generated by low cost (or low fares) carriers on the other. The former are characterized by a hub-and-spoke topology, with one central hub receiving and dispatching all flights; the latter by a point-to-point configuration, of a more random nature. The topological properties of the global network, as for instance its low diameter or the high clustering coefficient, only appear when several layers of different nature are merged together. While an analysis of the topology of connections may be relevant, at least from a theoretical point of view, the study of the dynamics taking place on top of it is of high interest for the air transport community, as it would allow tackling problems like the propagation of delays through the system, or the effects of such dynamics on the movement of passengers [19] . Ref. [16] tackles the problem of passenger rescheduling when a fraction of the links, i.e. of flights, is randomly removed. A simple dynamical model is executed using two networks: the single-layer projected network, and the whole multilayer structure. In the latter, airlines incur in a cost whenever a passenger needs to change layer, thus effectively reducing the flexibility of the system. Results indicate that the layered structure is associated to a lower resilience of the system against such kind of perturbations. In other words, the use of a projection is a simplification that results in an over-estimation of the resilience of the air transport network, as it does not take into account the cost of moving between layers -see Fig. 53 for more details. At the intersection between the topological and dynamical analysis of the air transport network, Ref. [218] focused on the communicability, i.e. the number of possible routes that two nodes can choose to communicate with each other [216] . By aggregating the communicability corresponding to each departure node, i.e. considering the broadcasting of information to passengers, and by varying the degree of interactions between different layers, it is possible to create airport rankings that takes into account the multilayer structure or, in other words, quantifies the effects of the airline structure on the movement of passengers. The most central node thus varies: while the airport of Paris CdG is the most central in Europe when layers are disconnected (main consequence of the extension of the Air France network), this role is passed to London Stansted and Frankfurt when increasing the coupling.

Authors utilize a unique database of supervisory reports of Italian banks to the Banca d'Italia, including all bilateral exposures of all Italian banks, broken down by maturity and by the secured and unsecured nature of the contract. Each layer in the network represents a different type of exposure, namely: unsecured overnight, unsecured short-term (less than 12 months), unsecured longterm (more than 12 months), secured short-term and secured long-term. The analysis of these five layers shows a high heterogeneity between them, with the topology of the overall network largely reflecting the one of the unsecured overnight layer. This layer is especially important from the policy-making point of view, as it is the focus of monetary policy operations in several jurisdictions. Notably, such layer is characterized by a high persistence of links over time, such that, if two banks are connected at a given time, they will have a high probability of being connected in the future. This may have important consequences in the stability of the system, in terms of perturbations contagion.",

[453] , focusing on the shareholding and board structures in the year 2013 for 273 quoted companies on the Italian Stock Market.

Among the resulting shared modules, some examples include the Mini Chromosome Maintenance complex, which plays an important role in eukaryotes DNA replication [502] , or the V-ATPase, an ancient and highly preserved enzyme that performs different functions in eukaryotes cells [503] . It has also been proposed the multilayer analysis of the protein-protein interaction network by considering the type of relation connecting pairs of them: physical when they can bind together to form a larger complex, and genetic if one of the two proteins regulates the other, i.e. by triggering the activation (or repression) of the gene responsible for the production of the target protein [457] .",

These two approaches are explored in Refs. [458, 459] . Specifically, Ref. [458] works with a multilayer structure composed of 130 co-expression networks, in which each layer represents a different experimental condition. The aim was the identification of recurrent heavy subgraphs, i.e. subsets of densely interconnected nodes that consistently appear in the different layers. While this is similar to a community identification task in a single layer, the simultaneous analysis of multiple layers is expected to enhance signal-noise separation. In Ref. [459] , an initial data set of gene expressions is used to create two different networks: firstly, a standard coexpression network, where pairs of genes are connected whether a relationship (e.g. statistical correlation) is found between their expression levels; and secondly, an exon co-splicing network, in which nodes represent exons and the edge weights represent correlations between the inclusion rates of two exons across all samples in the data set. These two networks are not independent, but indeed form a two-layers system, as each gene contains several exons. Furthermore, transcription and splicing factors are expected to be consistent among related genes, thus giving rise to coupled modules. This last hypothesis has been confirmed by comparing the obtained modules with data sets of gene functions.",

This remarkable data set has then been used to build a multilayer structure, in which each layer represents each one of those social aspects. Beyond the complete, or control, network, two more have been reconstructed, by monitoring the social changes resulting from the death of two subjects, specifically a dominant and a low-ranked female. This allowed Authors to compare the topological properties of the three networks, specifically their clustering coefficients, and analyze how social ties are modified by the two events. The loss of the dominant female resulted in an instability in the dominance hierarchy, which was compensated for by adjustments in the spatial association network. On the other hand, the loss of the low-ranked female had little effect on the social network. This suggests that dominance serves to regulate the interactions of all group members.",

However, there is still a lot of work ahead in order to set a proper and comprehensive mathematical formalism, and possibly a long way to go. Among the different open problems to be solved, we highlight the following three: (i) the need of setting up other metric concepts that could possibly affect relevant parameters of the systems, such as the betweenness, the vulnerability and the efficiency amongst others; (ii) the need of gathering a better knowledge and understanding on the mathematical relationships among the values of centrality parameters when measured on each single network's layer and when, instead, measured on the whole multilayer structure; (iii) the need of paying effort for extending other quantifications pertinent to the dynamics of single-layer networks, such as, for instance, those regarding controllability and observability.",

Possibly, this is the part of state of the art that still lies in its infancy. Definitely, and much more than being confident of, this issue is of the utmost importance. Retrieving the mechanisms at the basis of what is ubiquitously seen in social, technological and biological environments will certainly contribute to uncover the intimate physical processes that ultimately determine the way networked systems shape their interactions. Multilayer and multiplex networks encode indeed, significant more information in their structure with respect to their single-layers taken in isolation. A direct way to extract information from these structures is to look at correlations. For multiplex networks, these can be represented by degree correlations between different layers, or overlap of the links, or correlations in the activities of the nodes. For networks of networks, the degrees of freedom are even more pronounced since the interlinks between the nodes in different layers can be assigned using a large variety of rules. In our Section 3, we have tried to give an overview of generative models using both a growing multilayer network framework, and the framework of an ensemble of networks generating unbiased null models. Growing multiplex network models can be used to generate multiplexes with positive correlation in the degrees of the nodes, when the preferential attachment is linear, or tunable (positive or negative) degree correlation when the preferential attachment is non linear. On the other side, multiplex network ensembles using multilinks can be used to generate multiplex networks with tunable levels of overlap of the links incident to each node, that cannot be generated using the configuration model in each layer of the multiplex.",

Such processes, indeed, once defined on multilayer networks, display many relevant and unexpected properties that cannot be simply reported to the case of a single layer. As soon as interdependencies between the nodes in different layers are taken into account, one of the most important questions is to characterize their robustness properties, i.e. their response to random damage. In systems like complex infrastructures, we observe that an increased level of interdependencies can be responsible for an increased fragility of the system that might be affected by cascades of failure events. On the other hand, in a network with interdependencies between the nodes of different layers, the percolation transition can be discontinuous, indicating a discontinuous emergence/disruption of the mutually connected component. At the same time, the response to damage of these networks generates eventually a disrupting avalanche of failures events. The investigation of the effects of multiplexity into the robustness of networks has revealed that when the networks are uncorrelated and each node has at least one interdependency link, the transition is always expected to be discontinuous and characterized by avalanches of failures.",

            "text": "The nature (and structural characteristic) of the interlink might also affect the robustness properties of the network. For instance, in the context of networks of networks, if any node is linked to its replica node and there is a fixed supernetwork, the size of the mutually connected component is independent of the structure of the supernetwork as long as it is connected, while in the case of nodes randomly linked to other nodes in other layers, the structure of the supernetwork matters. Moreover, if the nodes are only connected to their replica ones, either all the layers percolate, or none does. In the case in which the nodes in one layer are linked to random nodes in other layers, one has that layers with higher superdegrees are more fragile than layers with lower superdegrees. Moreover, in the presence of partial interdependence or overlap of the links, the transition can become continuous, and the response to damage less disruptive. This opens the challenging problem of characterizing the general structural conditions that can enhance resilience and robustness of the entire system. While for infrastructure and man made networks it is plausible to assume that the design of the system has not taken into account the role of interdependencies and has therefore resulted in fragile structures, in biological system such as the cell (or the brain) we are more inclined to believe that evolution must have driven the system toward a relatively robust configuration, at least finding a tradeoff between robustness and adaptability of the entire system. In Section 5 we have shown that spreading processes in multilayer networks constitute possibly one of the best suited dynamical frameworks to unveil the effects that the coupling between networks has on their functioning. For instance, linear diffusion being the most simple dynamical setup allows to monitor the transition between two limiting regimes (one in which the networks behave independently and another corresponding to a coordinated functioning) with the transition between these two phases appearing to be abrupt according to the spectrum of the Laplacian. The use of more refined diffusion processes such as random walkers allows to go one step further and device tools for ranking the importance of the nodes, and monitoring it as a function of the coupling between networks. The study of even more realistic diffusion processes, such as those mimicking the transport of information packets, on interconnected networks has been also addressed, although more results on this line are certainly to be expected. In this regard, the transition to congestion in information networks is of key importance.",

Compared with the case of single-layer networks, this new framework can greatly change the threshold of disease outbreak, which is usually shown in the form of a phase transition between the healthy and epidemic phases. More research regarding this important issue is needed since SIR and SIS models seem to behave differently. In particular, SIR dynamics allows system states in which the epidemic regime only occurs in one of the networks (while not affecting the others) whereas for the SIS dynamics the propagation in one network automatically induces the epidemic in all the remaining networks. Besides the prediction of the epidemic threshold, we also emphasized studies that take advantage of the multilayer benchmark to couple the spreading dynamics with the development of voluntary prevention measures to control and eradicate the infection risk. Along this research line, there is still room for many proposals considering interconnected networks. As it is known, social dynamics, including information propagation and opinion formation, plays a non-trivial role in the risk perception under an epidemic threat. Apart from studying the emergence of individual contention measures under disease outbreaks, the same approach seems to be adequate to explore dynamical prevention measures in the Internet, so to control, in a dynamical way, the attack of viruses.",

At variance with games in single-layer networks, evolutionary games on different network layers can be coupled via either the utility function or the strategy of the nodes. We summarized the main influence of these kinds of inter-layer coupling on the maintenance of collective cooperation behavior both in pair-wise games (such as the Prisoner's Dilemma) and n-person ones (such as the Public Goods Game). The reviewed studies clearly point out that the different coupling between networks enriches the enhancement of cooperative behaviors provided by spatial reciprocity. In spite of the great achievements, there are still unexplored problems related to evolutionary games that merit further attention. The most obvious issue is extending to multilayer networks other types of games like the Ultimatum game [508, 509] , the Rock-Scissor-Paper game [510] , the Naming game [511, 512] and the Collective-risk social dilemma [513] . These games usually focus on the emergence of other collective states such as, fairness, species diversity, cyclical dominance, language evolution and prevention of dangerous climate change. Within the novel multilayer framework, one can get a better understanding on the impact that the interaction among different networks plays on the emergence of collective states. For instance, during the campaign of mitigating climate change, the mutual impact of different local systems is crucial. If the total contribution of these systems is less than the expected target, it may cause a cascade of reducing investment leading to the tragedy of the commons [514] . Experimental research is another unexplored field of evolutionary games on multilayer networks. Previous experiments on single-layer networks have unveiled that heterogeneous topology does not promote cooperation [515] , which is inconsistent with theoretical predictions [341] . Naturally, if the multilayer interaction is involved, how cooperation trait varies will become of particular importance.",

Other specific cases we considered are coexisting layers, hypergraphs, interconnected networks, multiplex networks and bipartite graphs. Finally, we discussed recent results on the problem of targeting dynamical trajectories of a system. The new approach we described for general network evolution opens several possibilities for research areas in the near future. In particular, it should be noted that by the application of Eqs.

            "text": "Finally, in Section 7 we have reviewed the current literature on applications of the multilayer formalism and representation to several cases of relevance in social sciences, technological systems and economy. We firmly believe that in the future biology and biomedicine will greatly take advantage of a multilayer representation, although these two fields of research have until now lag behind. This is mainly due to the difficulty associated with the recording of real data in living organisms, especially with the high resolution needed to discriminate the physical layers. This is, for instance, the case of the human brain: while the human cortex is composed of six layers, each one processing information in a distinctive way, actual recording technologies (e.g. EEG or MEG) can only detect the activity of the top-most layers. When functional representations (i.e. representing the activity of the brain in terms of information processing) will be merged with structural ones (e.g. the connectome, that is, the structure of fibers connecting different parts of the brain), the result will be a complex multilayer network, describing both how and why information moves. Beyond the brain, it is commonly accepted that cells are composed of different networks interacting between them: from the RNA, mRNA, up to proteins and metabolites. While these networks have been deeply studied in separated and isolated fashion, many pathological conditions generate from the wrong interaction of the different networks (layers). Adopting the multilayer paradigm will then provide an elegant mathematical way of representing these cross-interactions, paving the way for a deeper comprehension of the structure and function of cells.",
