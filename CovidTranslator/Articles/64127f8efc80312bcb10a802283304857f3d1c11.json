Screening tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC), may be done on clinically normal animals when they are acquired to avoid a financial and/or emotional commitment to a diseased animal, to examine geriatric patients for subclinical disease, or to identify a condition that might make an animal an anesthetic or surgical risk. Screening tests are often done when an ill animal is first examined, especially if systemic signs of illness are present and a specific diagnosis is not apparent from the history and physical examination. Tests are also done to confirm a presumptive diagnosis. A test may be repeated or a different test may be done to confirm a test result that was previously reported to be abnormal. Tests may be done to assist in the determination of the severity of a disease, to help formulate a prognosis, and to monitor the response to therapy or progression of disease.",

A CBC is routinely done to establish a database for patient evaluation, while other hematology tests may be done in an attempt to evaluate a specific problem. Examples of more specific hematologic tests that focus on a problem identified during the diagnostic evaluation of an animal include coagulation tests, such as prothrombin time; bone marrow biopsy and interpretation; and immunologic tests, such as the direct Coombs' test. Although single tests may be done to address a specific problem (e.g., an erythrocyte phosphofructokinase assay), multiple tests are often utilized to provide a more comprehensive answer to a broader problem (e.g., a hemostasis panel is generally requested to evaluate a bleeding animal).",

A major concern is whether the necessary personnel, equipment, and supplies are available to perform the test accurately. Considerations include personnel knowledge of species differences and a willingness to conduct quality-control tests to verify that the procedure is working properly. The costs per test (technician time, reagent costs, equipment costs) must be compared to determine which option is more economical. The stability of the test may determine whether it will be done internally. The time it takes to obtain results may be important, especially with critically ill patients. The hours of operation of the laboratories are important for test results that are needed at night or on the weekend.

Hematology analyzers must be calibrated for species differences to obtain accurate results. Technologists must be aware that blood cell morphology and blood parasites are different in various animal species. Antibody-dependent immunology tests designed for humans are generally not valid in animals. Veterinary laboratories are more likely to have established their own reference intervals for various animal species (as opposed to extracting them from the literature) than are human laboratories. A knowledge of specific animal diseases and training in veterinary laboratory medicine is essential for the evaluation of hematologic specimens and interpretation of laboratory data; consequently a veterinary clinical pathologist should be available to perform certain subjective tests and provide consultation concerning all test results.

The term reference interval is preferred to the commonly used normal range. The latter term implies that it is the range of test results from all \"normal\" animals. In reality, a low percentage of apparently healthy \"normal\" animals will have test values outside the normal range, and, depending on the test, many abnormal (diseased) animals may have values within the normal range. Healthy animals may have transient increases or decreases in laboratory test results based on changes in environment, emotional status, diet, and so on, and a low percentage of healthy animals simply have values above or below the general population of healthy animals. Apparently healthy animals may also have occult disease that causes one or more abnormal laboratory test results, and sample collection, handling, and laboratory errors can result in artifactually high or low values from healthy animals. Consequently it is not appropriate simply to use the actual range of values from all apparently healthy animals assayed. To develop useful reference intervals, one must decide which animals will be assayed, how many animals need to be analyzed, and what method or methods will be used to remove high or low outliers that would otherwise render the interval of limited value as a reference.",

Less often, a different reference interval is needed for an analyte from a specific breed of animal (e.g., hematocrit values in greyhound dogs are higher than those in most other dog breeds). Values may vary with the age of the animal, with major changes occurring prior to puberty (e.g., 3-week-old pups have lower hematocrits than adults). Consequently some analytes need different reference intervals for different age groups. Some analytes also vary with sex, pregnancy, emotional state, and activity level. The types of animals sampled and environmental conditions present during the establishment of a reference interval should be defined, along with the methods and equipment used, so that the user can make appropriate evaluations. Ideally, a reference interval should be established using a population of healthy animals with a composition (age, breed, sex, diet, etc.) like the population of ill animals being evaluated. Homogeneous populations generally have more narrow reference intervals than heterogenous populations. Establishing a reference interval for a blood analyte using a group of male foxhound dogs housed in a research colony, fed the same diet, and conditioned to phlebotomies would likely result in reference intervals too narrow for the population of dogs examined in a typical small-animal practice. Reference intervals are generally established for a species by utilizing samples from apparently healthy adult animals of both sexes and various breeds.

When a Gaussian distribution is present, a minimum of 40 individuals (100 or more is preferred) should be assayed for statistical validity. 2 In this case, the reference interval is calculated using the mean \u00b12 standard deviations (SD). This interval approximates the 95% confidence interval. In other words, about 95% of healthy animals have test values within this reference interval, with about 2.5% of healthy animals having values above and about 2.5% of healthy animals values below the reference interval. A common mistake made by novices is to calculate the reference interval from the mean \u00b11 SD. When this is done, about 32% of healthy animals will have values outside the calculated interval. If less than 40 healthy animals are available, the upper and lower values measured should be used to create an estimated reference interval. 5 Some analytes do not exhibit a Gaussian distribution. Most commonly there is a skew toward the higher values. The use of mean \u00b12 SD to calculate reference intervals results in inappropriate reference intervals for skewed populations, as shown in Figure 1 -2. Data may be manipulated (e.g., log or conducting the test. Hematology indices such as the red cell distribution width (RDW) vary more between laboratories, making the use of published reference intervals less acceptable.",

Most U.S. laboratories continue to use conventional units, such as mg/ dL; Canadian and European laboratories use the International System of Units (SI units), such as mmol/L. Where possible, moles are used rather than weight (e.g., mg) for SI units.

When significant hazards are associated with treatment (e.g., amputation or high-risk chemotherapy) or euthanasia is being considered, it is necessary to be as certain as possible that the disease is actually present. Consequently tests with high positive predictive values are needed for a rule-in strategy. When the penalty for missing a diagnosis is high, as with a disease for which therapy is effective if begun quickly, tests with high negative predictive values are theoretically important as a rule-out strategy. A normal test result by virtue of its high negative predictive value would suggest that the disease is not present. Unfortunately many diseases have low prevalence, which by itself can result in a high negative predictive value. The best evidence for ruling out a disease is finding a negative test result for an assay that has a high sensitivity for recognizing the disease. Based on the selected population of cats presented in Tables 1-1 and 1-2, finding a normal or increased blood lymphocyte count is more reliable for ruling out FIP than is finding a low lymphocyte count for making a diagnosis of FIP.",

Consequently, the specificity of a test can vary when populations containing animals with other diseases are analyzed. PVPTs and PVNTs also vary considerably depending on the population analyzed. Although accurate values are not usually available for PVPTs and PVNTs, clinicians use their knowledge and experience, combined with the principles outlined above, to make informed judgments concerning the likelihood that a disease can be ruled in or ruled out of the differential diagnosis. These decisions are seldom based on a single test result; instead, information in the history is considered along with the clinical signs and results of the physical examination, diagnostic imaging, and other laboratory tests. The likelihood that a disease will be present increases if several findings are supportive of the diagnosis. For example, in the FIP study discussed above, the PVPT was 35% for cats with lymphopenia, 77% for cats with lymphopenia and hyperglobulinemia, and 89% for cats with lymphopenia, hyperglobulinemia, and a positive coronavirus titer. The PVNT increased from 97% when lymphopenia alone was absent to 99% when all three findings were absent. Minimal change occurs in the PVNT because the relatively low disease prevalence in the population is a major contributing factor to the high negative PVNT. This contribution is most clearly demonstrated by looking at blood monocyte data in the FIP study presented in Table 1 -1. Only 7% of FIP cats have a monocytosis (sensitivity), and the PVPT for monocytosis is only 4%, yet the PVNT for a cat lacking a monocytosis is 88%.",

For example, low mean cell volume (MCV) is a diagnostic test suggestive of chronic iron deficiency in dogs. If we use 64 fL as the lower limit of the reference interval to calculate its positive predictive value, the value would not be remarkably high because there are various other relatively common disorders that can result in low MCVs in dogs, most notably inflammatory conditions and portosystemic shunts. However, it is recognized that the other causes of microcytosis rarely result in MCV values below 52 fL. Consequently, if a dog has a MCV below 52 fL, chronic iron deficiency anemia is highly likely and the PVPT using this cutoff value would approach 100%. However, 52 fL is not routinely used as a cutoff value for a positive test because many cases of chronic iron deficiency would be missed. Nonetheless, it is important to realize that dogs with especially low MCV values almost certainly have chronic iron deficiency anemia.",

As the cutoff value for plasma fibrinogen concentration is increased, the specificity and PVPT increase, but the sensitivity and PVNT decrease (see Table 1 -3). Results from this study also demonstrate that the PVPT increases and the PVNT decreases as the prevalence of disease in a population increases. In choosing the most appropriate cutoff value for a test, one must consider a number of factors including sensitivity and specificity of the test, prevalence of disease in the population being tested, and consequences of false-positive and false-negative tests. In the example above, failure to identify an infected foal (false-negative test) might result in the debilitation or death of the foal. Conversely, the treatment of healthy foals based on false-positive test findings could result in unnecessary financial losses and potential injury to healthy foals as a result of the adverse side effects of antimicrobial therapy.",

Precision or, more accurately, the amount of imprecision present in an assay, is determined by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) for repeated measurements made on a single Test results (mmol/L) sample. The CV is the standard deviation (SD) of the repeated measurements expressed as a percent of the mean of the repeated measurements (SD/mean \u00d7 100). The CV indicates the amount of random error (imprecision) that is present in an assay. A high CV value (e.g., more than 10%) indicates that an assay lacks precision. A low CV value (e.g., less than 5%) indicates that assay results are reproducible, varying little with repeated measurement. The degree of imprecision of an assay can also be measured over time intervals to assess within-run, between-run, or between-day variation. Test results (mmol/L) selected blood films (100 cells per differential). CVs were also calculated from results from 20 pairs of randomly selected slides (200 cells per differential). Last, CVs were calculated from results from 20 quads of randomly selected slides (400 cells per differential). As expected, the CVs for leukocyte types that were numerous (e.g., neutrophils) were much lower than CVs for leukocyte types that were present in low numbers (e.g., basophils), and CVs decreased as the total number of cells counted in the differential increased (Figs. 1-9 and 1-10) .",

This means that the total leukocyte count would have to increase by more than 35% before the therapy could be assumed to have an influence on this analyte. In the example above, the automated total leukocyte count would have to exceed 4600/\u00b5L \u00d7 1.35, or 6200/\u00b5L, before a therapeutic effect might be assumed. A considerably greater difference would be required if total leukocyte counts were done using a manual method because of its higher analytical CV. A greater critical difference might also have been calculated in the above example had client-owned animals been used for this study rather than laboratory animals, because it is likely that the biological variation would be higher in client-owned animals that were not accustomed to the phlebotomy procedure, the individuals handling them, or the environment in which the phlebotomy was done. Unfortunately, critical difference measurements have been done for few analytes in veterinary medicine, and values will",
