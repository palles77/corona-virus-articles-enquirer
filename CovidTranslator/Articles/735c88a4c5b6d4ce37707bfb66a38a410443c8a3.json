Methods: A cross-sectional survey study was conducted with a convenience sampling. Participants were pilgrims, aged over 18, and able to speak Arabic or English. A self-administered structured questionnaire was distributed during Hajj season in Mecca. Descriptive and multiple linear regression analysis were used in data analysis. Results: Two hundred and fifty-seven participants completed the study, 80% of whom were female, and the median (IQR) age was 35 (24.5e43.5) years. Pilgrims had moderately correct knowledge and accurate attitudes about MERS-CoV with median scores of 5 (IQR 4e7) and 6 (IQR: 5e7) respectively. Educational level and employment status were significantly associated with knowledge whereas gender and age were significantly associated with attitude and practices respectively (P < 0.05). The correlation between knowledge, attitude and practices was significant (correlation coefficient: 0.207; P < 0.05). Better knowledge was found to be a predictor for positive practice. Conclusions: These findings will provide insight when designing future interventions to promote specific messages to enhance knowledge, change attitude and improve practice regarding MERS-CoV.",

These imported cases highlight the fact that MERS-CoV, like other airborne viruses such as influenza, has the capability for worldwide spread.

Knowledge and application of basic hygiene principles and measures in such an environment is therefore vitally important. However, pilgrims may not be aware of MERS-CoV and the protective measures that should be followed to reduce the spread of infectious diseases during the Hajj as had been reported in previous studies [8, 9] .

The ritual performed on these days is called the Stoning of the Devil and it takes place at Jamaraat, Mina.

Dichotomized \"yes\", \"no\" and \"don't know\" options were used for the purpose of evaluation using nine items. To make a clear demarcation of participants' knowledge level, the responses were scored. Every correct answer added one mark to a participant's total score, and zero was given for wrong or uncertain answers. The minimum possible score for each section (knowledge, attitude and practices) is zero, while the maximum is nine. To discern the knowledge differences among the groups, the knowledge score was further divided into three categories: a cut-off value of 8 was taken as good knowledge, while between 5 and 7 was considered moderate and a score of 4 was considered as a poor knowledge score. (3) Section three: This section evaluated participant attitudes and beliefs about coronavirus. Nine items were provided for the participants to disclose their beliefs using a three-item Likert-type scale (agree, disagree, uncertain). Every appropriate attitude added one mark to a participant's total score, and zero was given for inappropriate attitude. A cut-off value of 8 was taken as good attitude, while between 5 and 7 was considered moderate and a score of 4 was considered as a poor attitude score.

Fig. 1 illustrates the responses to the knowledge questions (KQ) 1e9. Seventy-seven percent (198/257) of participants incorrectly believed that stomach cramps, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting are mark symptoms of coronavirus. A majority of Hajj pilgrims (67%, 173/257) held misconceptions that antibiotics can be used to treat coronavirus. In terms of knowledge regarding the incubation period of coronavirus, most participants (55%, 142/257) did not know that the incubation period or the period between exposure to coronavirus infection and the appearance of the first symptoms is from two to 14 days, and fewer than half of the participants (45%, 115/257) did not know that people with comorbidity (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancer and other chronic diseases) are more likely to be infected with coronavirus. Meanwhile, fewer than half of Hajj pilgrims were not aware that there is no vaccine available in the market to protect against coronavirus (42%, 109/ 257). Ninety-seven (38%) participants incorrectly believed that the main source of coronavirus is a plant.",

Almost 75% (188/257) of participants agreed that taking pain and fever medications cannot relieve coronavirus symptoms.

Approximately 65% of the French [8] , 45% of the Turkish [9] , and only 35% of the Australian [16] pilgrims were aware of the MERS-CoV epidemic in Saudi Arabia. However, according to the French study [8] , the French pilgrims were more serious about taking the protective measures.

In addition, 70% of participants did not recognise hallmark symptoms of MERS-CoV and 45% did not know that people with comorbidities are more likely to be infected. Lack of information about the source of the virus was also noticed, with 38% of participants remaining unaware that bats and camels are the most suspected source of the virus.

However, some participants (40%) showed a negative attitude towards the use of protective measures such as avoiding food prepared under unsanitary conditions and contact with live animals.

The MoH, for example, launched one of the largest public awareness campaigns in Saudi Arabia to educate the community regarding the possible modes of transmission of MERS-CoV [17] . It included television advertisements that introduced virus to the public and discussed ways to avoid infection transmission. It also used text messages to update the public on new development; these sent via mobile phones and different social media platforms. However, based on the current findings, a more rigorous public health educational method is recommended to correct misconceptions. This can be done by addressing the public through utilising media and social media resources [17] . The establishment of a telephone helpline to provide further information and educational support to Hajj pilgrims would also be a useful option. Alternatively, formation of community organisations and pre-hajj educational campaigns carried out in schools, colleges and shopping malls may also educate the public.",

Providing verbal, written, pictorial and recorded information in various languages is essential to educate and empower pilgrims from different educational backgrounds and ethnic groups with the information needed to manage their health, reduce the risk of MERS-CoV transmission and meet their needs during the Hajj. Countries around the globe need to develop a compelling vision for what pilgrims need to know about MERS-CoV, when they need to know it, who is the appropriate person, what is the suitable method and language to deliver the information. Synthesizing current knowledge about people's understanding, attitudes and practices about coronavirus is essential. Developing a research agenda to provide the intellectual foundation and guide future practice in teaching and learning about MERS-CoV is also crucial. For example, piloting future public health campaigns to test knowledge before implementation is essential. Fostering the implementation, assessment documentation and dissemination of innovative and effective practices for teaching about MERS-CoV is also important.",
