In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-meta-genomic 20 approach, examining close matches to the Wuhan coronavirus 2019-nCoV in all high-21 throughput sequencing datasets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the 22 keyword \"virome\". In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions ), we note a strong 25 homology to numerous sequence reads in a metavirome dataset generated from the lungs of 26 deceased Pangolins reported by Liu et al.

As a reference, and to benchmark the workflow 86 further, we included several additional sequences in the query (Vaccinia virus, an arbitrary 87 segment of a flu isolate, the full sequence of bacteriophage P4, and a number of putative 88 polinton sequences from Caenorhabditis briggsae). The relatively small group of k-mers 89 being queried (<10 6 ) allows a rapid search for homologs. This was implemented in a Python 90 script run using the PyPy accelerated interpreter. We stress that this is by no means the most 91 comprehensive or fastest search for large datasets. However, it is more than sufficient to 92 rapidly find any closely matching sequence (with the downloading and conversion of the data, 93 rather than the search, being rate limiting). Figure S1 .

We were most interested in 119 viruses with highly similar sequences, as these would likely be most useful in forming 120 hypotheses about the origin and pathology of the recent human virus. We thus set a 121 threshold requiring matching of a perfect 32-nucleotide segment with a granularity of 8 122 nucleotides in the search (i.e., interrogating the complete database of k-mers from the virus 123 with k-mers starting at nucleotide 1, 9, 17, 25, 33 of each read from the metagenomic data for 124 a perfect match). This would catch any perfect match of 39 nucleotides or greater, with some 125 homologies as short as 32 nucleotides captured depending on the precise phasing of the read.",

From the quick k-mer search, an initial indicator could be inferred from the 143 number of matching reads and k-mer match counts for those reads [Table 1, Supplementary 144Table 1]. For the 2019-nCoV matches amongst the available metagenomic datasets, the 145 strongest and most abundant matches in these analyses came from the pangolin lung 146 metaviromes. The matches were observed throughout the 2019-nCoV query sequence and 147 many of the matching reads showed numerous matching 32-mer sequences. The vast 148 majority of matches were in two lung samples with small numbers of matches in two 149 additional lung datasets (11). No matches were detected for five additional lung datasets, and 150 no matches were seen in eight spleen samples and a lymph node sample (11). Further151 analysis of coverage and homology through alignment of the entire metagenomic datasets 152 revealed an extensive, if incomplete, coverage of the 2019-nCoV genome [Figure 1a]. Percent 153 nucleotide similarity can be calculated for pangolin metavirome reads aligning to 2019-nCoV 154 [Figure 1b], and these segmental homologies consistently showed strong matches, 155 approaching (but still overall weaker than) the similarity of the closest known bat coronavirus 156 (RaTG13). distribution of nucleic acid sequences in diverse environmental niches. As metagenomic 161 datasets proliferate and as both the need and capability to identify pathogenic agents through 162 sequencing increase, meta-metagenomic searching may prove extremely useful in tracing the 163 origins and spreading of causative agents. In the example we present in this paper, such a 164 search identifies a number of niches with sequences matching the genome of the recent 2019-165 nCoV virus. These analyses raise a number of relevant points for the origin of 2019-nCoV. 166 Before describing the details of these points, however, it is important to stress that while 167 environmental, clinical, and animal-based sequencing is valuable in understanding how 168 viruses traverse the animal ecosphere, static sequence distributions cannot be used to 169 construct a virus' full transmission history amongst different biological niches. So even were 170 the closest relative of a virus causing disease in species X to be found in species Y, we cannot 171 define the source of the outbreak, or the direction(s) of transmission. As some viruses may 172 move more than once between hosts, the sequence of a genome at any time may reflect a 173 history of selection and drift in several different host species. This point is also accentuated 174 in the microcosm of our searches for this work. When we originally obtained the 2019-nCoV 175 sequence from the posted work of Wu et al., we recapitulated their result that bat-SL-176 CoVZC45 was the closest related sequence in NCBI's non-redundant (nr/nt) database. In our 177 screen of metavirome datasets, we observed several pangolin metavirome sequences-which 178 are not currently in the (nr/nt) database-and which are more closely related to 2019-nCoV 179 than bat-SL-CoVZC45. An assumption that the closest relative of a sequence identifies the 180 origin would at that point have transferred the extant model to zoonosis from pangolin 181 instead of bat. To complicate such a model, an additional study from Zhou et al. (12) 182 described a previously unpublished Coronavirus sequence, designated RaTG13 with much 183 stronger homology to 2019-nCoV than either bat-SL-CoVZC45 or the pangolin reads from Liu 184 et al (11). While this observation certainly shifts the discussion (legitimately) toward a 185 possible bat-borne intermediate in the chain leading to 2019-nCoV, it remains difficult to 186 determine if any of these are true intermediates in the chain of infectivity. 187 The match of 2019-nCoV to the pangolin coronavirus sequences also enables a link to 188 substantial context on the pangolin samples from Liu et al. (11), with information on the 189 source of the rescued animals (from smuggling activity), the nature of their deaths despite 190 rescue efforts, the potential presence of both other coronaviruses and other non-corona 191 viruses in the same cells, and the accompanying pathology. That work describes analyses 192 indicating several coronaviruses present in two of the pangolin lungs as well as other viral 193 species in those lungs. The pangolins appear to have died from lung-related illness, which 194 may have involved the 2019-nCoV closely-related virus. Notably, however, two of the 195 deceased pangolin lungs had much lower coronavirus signals, while five showed no signal, 196 with sequencing depths in the various lungs roughly comparable. Although it remains 197 possible that the 2019-nCoV-like coronavirus was the primary cause of death for these 198 animals, it is also possible (as noted by Liu et al. (11)) that the virus was simply present in the 199 tissue, with mortality due to another virus, a combination of infectious agents, or other 200 exposures.201During the course of this work, the homology between 2019-nCoV and pangolin 202 coronavirus sequences in a particular genomic subregion was also noted and discussed in an 203 online forum (\"Virological.org\") with some extremely valuable analyses and insights.",

Notably, while reads from the pangolin lung dataset mapped to this region do not 212 show a similar increase in variation relative to the human 2019-nCoV, we also did not observe213 a significant drop in variance between human and pangolin in this region. While Wong et al. 214 concluded that recombination likely occurred in the spike region in the derivation of 2019-215 nCoV, definitive conclusions regarding the origins of 2019-nCoV are difficult given the limited 216 sequencing data available and without consideration to altered evolutionary rates in different 217 lineages (15).

Default klen = 32 ## snpAllow = <Set to True to allow a single mismatch in each k-mer (default is False) ## Circular = <Set to True to force every Reference sequence to be treated as a circle> ## Default : Uses the FastA name line--if this line contains \"Circular\", the sequence is treated as a circle ## Multithreading: Jazz18Heap has the very primative multitasking ability to spawn a number ## of derivative processes for a large number of data files to be scanned. To use 16 Threads ## Set MultiThreading=16 in the command line. ## Output: ## Output consists of a log file with information on the run and a FastA file. ## FastA files have information about each read in the ID line ## ID Structure: ## DataFileName;LineNumberInDataFile;ReferenceFileName;ReferenceSequenceName;NumberOfMatchedKmers ## Running the program: ## Jazz18Heap only runs at full speed with a variant of Python (PyPY) that included a just-in-time compiler ## Syntax Jazz18Heap RefFile=<MyRefFile> DataFiles=MyFastA1.fasta,MyFastA2.fasta.gz,MyFastQ*.",
