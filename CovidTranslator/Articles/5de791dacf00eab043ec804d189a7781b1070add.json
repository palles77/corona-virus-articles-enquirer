Antibodies constitute a potent tool to study such proteins, enabling conclusions on protein location and time course of expression. However, common antibody production in mice or rabbits requires tedious protein expression and injection, as well as blood collection at regular intervals. To simplify this procedure, IgY antibodies specific for poxviral proteins (F1L and p28) were generated by immunisation of chickens, because antibody retrieval from eggs allows the noninvasive generation of huge amounts of antibodies. The main intentions were (i) to decrease invasiveness, (ii) to immunise with native forms of proteins and (iii) to circumvent previous protein expression and purification. Therefore, chicken were immunised with DNA expression vectors coding for conserved domains of the selected proteins delivered for the first time by a gene gun. Four weeks after initial immunisation specific antibodies were found in the egg yolk as proven by immunofluorescence staining of poxvirus-infected cells. The specific IgY titre rose to 1:80,000 and was stable for more than 120 days. With this investigation we present an universal procedure for IgY design and production that can be applied for various issues in the future.",

Such specific antibodies are often inaccessible and the only solution is inhouse antibody production commonly conducted in laboratory mice and rabbits. Standard antibody production in mammals consists of in vitro expression of the antigen, its purification and administration and finally bleeding of the immunised animals for serum extraction. Depending on the amount of serum needed and on how bleeding is commenced up to the whole amount of the animals' blood must be collected. In such cases final bleeding is commenced and leads to animal sacrification.",

Since 1969 it has been known that IgG-like molecules are found in chicken serum (Leslie and Clem, 1969) . Because of their predominance in the egg yolk they have been designated IgY. Until today IgY have been found in all bird species which offers new perspectives for antibody production. The necessity for antibodies specific for several poxviral proteins that are potentially involved in pathogenesis and modulation of apoptosis has led to the development of a straightforward procedure of producing IgY.",

One of the most striking advantages is the fact that B-cell formation and differentiation in the chicken are performed completely differently from those in mammals (Reynaud et al.,1989; Pink et al., 1985) . Because IgY antibodies recognise different antigens they can become valuable tools against difficult target epitopes. Moreover, birds can produce antibodies against proteins that are highly conserved in mammals and that may not be immunogenic in rabbits or mice (Tini et al., 2002) . Finally, there is no crossreactivity between mammal and avian antibodies, as well as no interference in immunological assays caused by the human complement system and rheumatoid factors. This is useful for complex immunocytochemistry applications with multiple antibodies (Larsson et al., 1993; Carlander et al., 1999) . In cases where antibodies are used for virus diagnostics, IgY help avoiding false positive reactions in samples containing bacteria which could occur when IgG is used. This is founded by the fact that IgY do not bind bacterial surface proteins like protein A or protein G (Warr et al., 1995) .",

It is reported that the amount of IgY equal to the antibody content in 0.5 l of mammalian serum (in mice 0.1 ml blood can be taken once a week [Diehl et al., 2001] ) can be delivered by a chicken in one month (Jensenius et al., 1981) .",

This leads to a reduction of stress for the animals (Schade et al., 1991) along with the reduced frequency of immunisations because high antibody titres are reached after DNA applications (Gassmann et al., 1990) . In general, DNA immunisation forms an effective alternative for antibody design and production in mice (Wolff et al., 1990 (Wolff et al., , 1992 . By applying nucleic acids for immunisation, there is no longer a need for expensive expression, complex purification and renaturation of immunogenic epitopes. Furthermore, the exclusion of inactivated biological materials (like virus particles or bacterial cells) for immunisation increases security for animal holding facilities. By application of DNA there is no risk of contamination with inefficiently inactivated microorganisms especially when working with highly pathogenic agents.",

The staining of p28 inside of VACV LE-infected cells showed no positive signal (data not shown) and served as an additional negative control, as the VACV LE genome codes for a strongly truncated homologue of p28 which consists of the initial 44 amino acids at DNA level but is not known to be expressed. These 44 amino acids were part of the DNA used for immunisation; however, the IgY produced did not bind within VACV LE-infected cells. This fact confirms the assumption that p28 is not expressed in VACV LE. Supplemental Fig. 3 also shows a Z-stack image of poxvirus-infected cells, consisting of six layers (0.4 \u00b5m each). The poxvirus staining (blue) was spread through the cells' cytoplasm around and above the nucleus (red). Circular structures of intensive blue staining illustrated viral factories situated horizontally around the nucleus. The green staining representing anti-p28 IgY was concentrated within the viral factories and co-localised with viral staining in these structures.",

Fig. 4 shows a representative example of a dilution series where a 1:2000 dilution of IgY was defined as negative. Fig. 5 summarizes the titre progression after immunisation. Sample collection started 31 days after initial DNA application with the first boost vaccination. At this point an anti-F1L-IgY titre of 1:20 was already detectable. Forty-one days after the immunisation the titre began to rise and reached a level of 1:2000 after 60 days post immunisation. The second boost on day 90 led to maximum titres of 1:80,000 after 100 days. Last samples taken for anti-F1L-IgYafter 120 days still showed a titre of 1:40,000. Immunisation with the p28 expression vector resulted in a similar titre progression up to day 60, but, in contrast to F1L, began to decrease after 70 days. IgY specific for p28 became undetectable after 87 days and did not rise after the second boost. The titre of anti-F1L continued to increase up to a value of 1:20,000 and after the third immunisation reached a maximum of 1:80,000.",

A reason for this could be the fact that the p28 subunit chosen for immunisation showed a low relative surface probability compared to the F1L subunit according to Fig. 1 . Due to its putative function and importance within p28, the C-terminal part (RING domain) of this protein seems more adequate for immunisation. However, this part is lacking in p28 homologues of several VACV strains and should not be used for antibody production when generic detection is required. An expansion of the subunit used for immunisation in 3\u2032-direction would presumably have not increased immunogenicity as hydrophilicity, antigenic index and surface probability downstream amino acid residue 100 are extremely low. The implementation of an earlier third immunisation step before day 60 post immunisation could prevent a titre reduction and lead to a further boost .",

The OPV codon usage is more effective in mice as rodents represent a possible host for VACV and a natural host for CPXV. Codon optimisation during DNA vaccine design could achieve higher immunogenicity caused by a more effective expression of antigen in the chicken and lead to higher titres, particularly with regard to p28 (Garmory et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2001) .
