Antibody titers to coronavirus SD were undetectable by an ELISA test prior to inoculation. Mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 7200 plaque forming units of SD grown in DBT cells in a 0.03 ml volume. Control mice were inoculated with a homogenate of uninfected DBT cells. Mice were sacrificed with ether, the brain and spinal column removed, and immediately snap frozen in a dry ice ethanol bath. Tissue was stored at -70\u00b0C prior to cryostat sectioning. Four/~m cryostat sections were fixed in acetone at -20\u00b0C, air dried and used immediately. For formalin fixation, anesthetized mice were perfused through the left ventricle of the heart with a 10% neutral buffered formalin solution until blanching of the liver occurred. Brain and spinal cord were then embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 5 Izm. Sections are de-paraffinized through xylene and alcohol prior to addition of primary antiserum for antigen detection. lodination ~25I-labeled protein A was obtained from Amersham Corporation, Arlington Heights, IL (55 mCi/mg). Rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG (Cappel) was purified using protein A Sephadex (Pharmacia) and iodinated by the iodogen method (Markwell and Fox, 1978) . One hundred microliters containing 2 mg of protein in PBS, pH 7.0, and 1 mCi of 125I-labeled sodium iodide (Amersham, specific activity 11-17 mCi//lg) were added to a glass tube that had been pre-treated with iodogen (25 tsg/tube) (Pierce Chemicals).

Duplicate samples were TCA precipitated (5%) to determine the specific activity. Iodination by this procedure yields from 105 to 106 cpm/#g of protein.",

Air-dried coverslips or tissue sections are placed in phosphatebuffered saline, pH 7.0, for 15 min prior to reaction with primary antiserum. The primary antiserum is a guinea pig anti-coronavirus serum prepared against purified coronavirus as described previously (Gerdes et al., 1981) . Fifty microliters of antiserum are added to each tissue section or monolayer that has been circled using a wax pencil and covered utilizing siliconized glass coverslips (Siliclad, Clay Adams). The antiserum is diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.4% bovine serum albumin (PBS-BSA). It is allowed to react for 30 rain at room temperature in a humidified chamber. The coverslip is then gently soaked off by dipping the slide in phosphate-buffered saline and washed using two 10-min rinses, again in phosphatebuffered saline. For immunofluorescence, 50 #1 of fluorescein (FITC) conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG (Miles) diluted in PBS-BSA is allowed to react for 30 min at room temperature covered by a siliconized coverslip. The coverslip is soaked off in PBS and the sections are washed twice, l0 min each in PBS. The tissue section is then coverslipped with 50% glycerin PBS and observed for fluorescence. For autoradiographic techniques, 50,000 cpm of 125I-labeled protein A or J251-1abeled goat anti-guinea pig IgG diluted in PBS-BSA are added to the section and again covered with a siliconized coverslip and incubated at 30 rain at room temperature.

These slides are then dipped in liquid emulsion (NTB-2 Kodak) that has been diluted 1 : 1 with distilled water containing 2% glycerol at 42\u00b0C. Emulsion coated slides are air dried for 10 min at room temperature and stored at 4\u00b0C in sealed light tight boxes containing Drie-rite.

The titration endpoint was defined as the highest dilution of this primary antiserum that retained specific reactivity. The end-point was 1:5120 for FA and by staphylococcal protein A autoradiography (SAAR) the end-point was 1:164.000 (Table I) . For both methods, with increasing dilution of the primary antiserum, the same number of infected foci was detectable, but the intensity of FA staining (Fig. 1) or numbers of silver grains (SAAR, Fig. 2 ) decreased. Therefore, compared to the FA test using identical sera, the ~25I-labeled protein A autoradiography was approximately 32 times greater in sensitivity following a 7 day exposure time. A working dilution was also determined from these experiments (Table I) and is defined as a dilution of primary antiserum producing maximal reactivity with infected cells and minimal non-specific reactivity with uninfected cells. ~25 I-labeled protein A alone revealed no reaction on infected cells. Detection of silver grains was greatly enhanced utilizing dark field microscopy (see Fig, 2 ), since silver grains are readily detectable even over darkly stained nuclei. In addition, background levels become readily apparent and the cells can be screened rapidly at lower power. In order to determine the optimum concentration of protein A required to detect viral antigen, 10-fold dilutions of the L25I-labeled protein A was reacted with infected cells pretreated with a working dilution ( 1 : 2560) of the guinea pig anti-coronavirus antiserum.

Day 4 post-inoculation is the peak of virus replication in the brain. The indirect FA method failed to detect antigen in these sections. However, using the indirect autoradiographic technique coronavirus antigen was found, particularly in neurons of the temporal cortex (Fig. 6) . Similar studies of mice sacrificed on day 6 post-infection failed to detect viral antigen. Therefore, the sensitivity of the autoradiographic technique is greatly reduced for paraffin embedded tissue, but it can detect a high level of antigenic expression. Preliminary experiments suggest that trypsin treatment, such as that utilized for immunofluorescence (Swoveland and Johnson, 1979) , does improve sensitivity of autoradiographic techniques on embedded tissue.",

Finally, the interspecies reactivity of staphylococcal protein A for the Fc receptor of IgG (Cronvall et al., 1970) makes this method preferable when attempting to detect antibody from different species. Interspecies activity also allows for the detection of IgG in tissue sections.",
