The aim of this study was to determine the effects of multiple i.v. injections of 10% butaphosphan and 0.005% cyanocobalamin combination (Catosal, Bayer Animal Health, Leverkusen, Germany) between 1 and 2 wk antepartum (a.p.) on the metabolism and health of dairy cows. Forty-five late-gestation Holstein-Friesian cows (second pregnancy) were allocated randomly to 1 of 3 groups with 15 cows/group: group C6 (6 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10 mg/kg of body weight (BW) and cyanocobalamin at 5 \u03bcg/kg of BW in the last 2 wk of gestation); group C3 (3 daily i.v. injections of butaphosphan at 10 mg/kg of BW and cyanocobalamin at 5 \u03bcg/kg of BW in the last week of gestation); and group C0 (equivolume daily i.v. injections of 0.9% NaCl solution). Serum biochemical analysis was performed on jugular venous blood samples that were periodically obtained a.serum nonesterified fatty acid and \u03b2-OH butyrate concentrations. The number of puerperal infections in the first 5 d after calving was decreased in group C6, relative to group C0. We conclude that multiple injections of Catosal during the close-up period have a beneficial effect on the metabolism of periparturient dairy cows. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that high-producing dairy cows in early lactation may have a relative or actual deficiency of cyanocobalamin.",

Enhanced lipolysis in the periparturient period was first identified in the 1970s and was termed fat mobilization syndrome by Morrow in 1976 (Morrow, 1976) . Increased lipolysis in the periparturient dairy cow is accompanied by an increased incidence of clinically important diseases such as ketosis, retained placenta, metritis, mastitis, abomasal displacement, and reduced immune resistance (Morrow, 1976; Curtis et al., 1985; Gerloff et al., 1986) . Fat mobilization syndrome is characterized by periparturient increases in serum NEFA and BHBA concentrations, and decreases in serum glucose, insulin, and IGF-1 concentrations (Aeberhard et al., 2001; F\u00fcrll and J\u00e4ckel, 2006) . The syndrome is associated with decreased productivity and reproductive performance (Butler, 2000; Leroy et al., 2006) and increased morbidity and death in severely affected animals.",

Numerous adjunct therapeutic agents that decrease periparturient lipolysis, promote fatty acid oxidation in hepatic mitochondria, or facilitate the export of lipoproteins from the liver have been investigated as adjunct agents for the treatment or control of fat mobilization syndrome. Studies in periparturient dairy cows have evaluated the effect of orally administered propylene glycol and propionate (Kris-tensen and Raun, 2007; Grummer, 2008) , glycerol (De-Frain et al., 2004) , nicotinic acid (F\u00fcrll, 1989; Drackley et al., 1998; Pires et al., 2007) , cis-linoleic acid (Selberg et al., 2004; Mosley et al., 2007) , fat (Drackley et al., 1998; Moallem et al., 2007) , methionine (Preynat et al., 2009) , choline (Chung et al., 2009) , carnitine (LaCount et al., 1995; Carlson et al., 2007) , and monensin (Arieli et al., 2008; Duffield et al., 2008) on fat mobilization syndrome. Other potential adjunctive treatments, such as insulin, glucagon, and dexamethasone, have been evaluated but suffer from several associated problems that affect their current use (F\u00fcrll and J\u00e4ckel, 2005; Nafikov et al., 2006) . There is a continuing need for an adjunct therapeutic agent that is effective in the treatment or prevention of fat mobilization syndrome in periparturient dairy cows.",

            "text": "Catosal (Bayer Animal Health, Leverkusen, Germany) is a commercially available mixture of cyanocobalamin (50 \u03bcg of cyanocobalamin/mL) and a phosphorus-containing compound (100 mg of butaphosphan/mL) that is labeled for the improvement of energy metabolism in cattle and pigs in 60 countries and as a source of cyanocobalamin and phosphorus for prevention or treatment of deficiencies of these nutrients in cattle, swine, horses, and poultry in the United States. The label dose of Catosal in the United States is 1 to 2 mL/100 lb of BW by i.v., i.m., or s.c. injection, equivalent to butaphosphan (0.45-0.91 mg/kg of BW) and cyanocobalamin (0.23-0.45 \u03bcg/kg of BW), and the injection can be repeated daily. Increased milk and milk protein yields have been observed following intramuscular cyanocobalamin administration (10 mg/cow per week) and oral cyanocobalamin supplementation (500 mg/cow per day; Girard and Matte, 2005; Graulet et al., 2007) , but the effects on metabolism have been variable (Schuh, 1994; F\u00fcrll et al., 2006; Lohr et al., 2006) . In dairy cattle, the phosphorus content of liver tissue decreases in early lactation due to a reduction in hepatocellular cytosol volume as well as a decrease in cytosolic phosphorus concentration (Gr\u00fcnberg et al., 2009) . Phosphorus supplementation may therefore be indicated in periparturient dairy cows because phosphorus plays an important role in hepatic carbohydrate metabolism, in which all intermediates in the gluconeogenic pathway must be phosphorylated, and because the rates of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis are regulated by phosphorus availability (Berg et al., 2006) . Several reports indicate a reduction in morbidity following administration of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin (Sommer et al., 1971; Flasshoff, 1974; Palmer, 1980; Schuh, 1994) , and a recent report indicated that injection of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin on the day of calving and 1 d later decreased the prevalence of subclinical ketosis during the week after calving in mature dairy cows (Rollin et al., 2010) . We therefore hypothesized that parenteral administration of Catosal in the late dry period would improve energy metabolism in periparturient dairy cattle. Accordingly, the main aim of this study was to determine the effects of multiple i.v. injections of a cyanocobalamin and butaphosphan combination (Catosal) administered between 1 and 2 wk antepartum (a.p.) on the metabolism of dairy cows.",

Serum cyanocobalamin concentrations are low in early lactation , and cyanocobalamin supply is considered a limiting factor for lactation performance. Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase is a cyanocobalamin-dependent enzyme that transforms methylmalonyl-CoA into succinyl-CoA; cyanocobalamin therefore plays a pivotal role in the entry of propionate into the Krebs cycle and the utilization of propionate for gluconeogenesis (Mykk\u00e4nen and Korpela, 1981; Girard and Matte, 2005) . These observations directly lead to the hypothesis that cyanocobalamin deficiency contributes to fat mobilization syndrome by decreasing the rate of propionate utilization for gluconeogenesis. The cyanocobalamin requirement of dairy cattle is 10 to 30 mg/d (Steinberg and Kl\u00fcnter, 1995) . Most of this daily requirement is provided by the metabolic activity of ruminal bacteria, which produce a mean of 73 mg of cyanocobalamin per day in lactating Holstein-Friesian cows; however, the oral bioavailability of cyanocobalamin is low (Santschi et al., 2005) . For comparison, cows in the C6 and C3 groups in the study reported here received 5 mg of cyanocobalamin i.v. daily for 6 or 3 d a.p., respectively, which increased serum cyanocobalamin concentration in a dose-dependent manner. As such, the dose of cyanocobalamin administered to the cows in the study reported here was biologically relevant.",

The results of previously published studies, and a compari-son of the effects of the 2 different dosage protocols used in the study reported here, indicate that the effects of cyanocobalamin and butaphosphan combination are dose-dependent and that a bioenergetically favorable response may require at least 3 i.v. injections of at least 3 mg of cyanocobalamin and 6 g of butaphosphan for each cow. It should be noted that the dry period of cows in the study reported here was 42 d. It is unknown whether treatment of cows with a longer dry period, which are more typical on some dairies, would have led to a different result.",

The precise mode of action of butaphosphan on metabolism is unknown, and the direct effect of butaphosphan on phosphorus homeostasis in animals remains unknown (EMEA, 1999) . It is questionable whether the effect of butaphosphan is simply a matter of the substitution of phosphorus (EMEA, 1999) , and butaphosphan injection to the cows in the study reported here did not immediately result in an increase in the serum phosphorus concentration (Figure 2 ). However, serum phosphorus and calcium concentrations were numerically higher in group C6 and C3 cows at p.p. d 1 than in group C0 cows (Figure 2; Figure 5 ); this result most likely reflects the numerically higher milk production on the first day after parturition in group C0 cows because lactation is a major drain on calcium and phosphorus. The numerically higher serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations in group C6 and C3 cows at p.p. d 1 may have also reflected improved overall health rather than a direct effect of butaphosphan on serum phosphorus concentration because serum phosphorus concentration is decreased in early lactating dairy cows with decreased feed intake and gastrointestinal motility (Gruenberg et al., 2005) . Serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations on d 1 and the first week after calving were not affected by s.c. administration of 25 mL of Catosal on the day of calving and 1 d later (Rollin et al., 2010) , supporting the concept that the elemental phosphorus in butaphosphan does not directly increase serum phosphorus concentrations in dairy cattle. The major label indications for butaphosphan are to treat disorders of metabolism and to support the treatment of infertility, tetany, and paresis as an adjunct to calcium and magnesium therapy (EMEA, 1999 (EMEA, , 2000 . Butaphosphan is rapidly eliminated primarily via the urinary tract after i.v. administration, with a terminal half-life of 116 min in lactating dairy cows (EMEA, 2000) . Although butaphosphan administration did not alter basal serum insulin or cortisol concentration in the study reported here (Figure 4) , butaphosphan has been shown to facilitate insulin release and glucose entry into insulin-dependent cells and decrease cortisol release in nonlactating dairy heifers (Hansel et al., 1992) and piglets undergoing social stress (van der Staay et al., 2007) through an unidentified mechanism. As such, butaphosphan may have contributed to the beneficial effects of Catosal administration to cows in groups C6 and C3. Additional investigations are necessary to clarify a possible synergistic action of butaphosphan and cyanocobalamin on energy metabolism.",

            "text": "We believe it is helpful to compare the effects of other adjunct treatments for the periparturient stabilization of metabolism (such as oral propylene glycol, propionate, glycerol, nicotinic acid, cis-linoleic acid, fat, methionine, choline, carnitine, monensin) to the decrease in NEFA concentrations at 1 and 3 d p.p. achieved in this study in group C6. Daily doses of propylene glycol exceeding 500 to 1,000 mL (or equivalent when dry propylene glycol formulations are fed) are required to significantly change serum NEFA, glucose, and insulin concentrations in periparturient dairy cattle (Kristensen and Raun, 2007; Grummer, 2008) ; doses of this magnitude are not currently approved within the European Union. The protective effects of glycerol supplements for transition cow feeding are variable (DeFrain et al., 2004) , and the consensus is that propylene glycol provides a superior and more predictable metabolic response than glycerol in periparturient dairy cows. The metabolic effects of nicotinic acid are dose-dependent (Drackley et al., 1998; Pires et al., 2007) . Although cis-linoleic acid supplementation can decrease milk fat content (Selberg et al., 2004; Mosley et al., 2007) , the metabolic effects of this treatment are unclear. Adding fat to ruminant rations can be effective in stabilizing energy metabolism, although decreased DMI and increased serum NEFA and BHBA concentrations have been described (Moallem et al., 2007) . Neither rumen-protected methionine (Preynat et al., 2009) or choline (Chung et al., 2009) plasma NEFA and BHBA concentrations in lactating dairy cows, although rumen-protected methionine decreased milk lactose concentration and increased milk protein concentration (Preynat et al., 2009) . Carnitine supplementation and monensin administration do not result in marked decreases in serum NEFA and BHBA concentrations in periparturient cows (LaCount et al., 1995; Carlson et al., 2007; Arieli et al., 2008; Duffield et al., 2008) . Dexamethasone, which is used to great effect postpartum in stabilizing metabolism and decreasing serum NEFA and bilirubin concentrations (F\u00fcrll and J\u00e4ckel, 2005) , cannot be used a.p. because of its effect on inducing parturition and increasing the incidence of retained placenta.",

Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that high-producing dairy cows in early lactation may have a relative or actual deficiency of cyanocobalamin. Additional studies are indicated to investigate the potential synergistic effects of cyanocobalamin and butaphosphan in improving the metabolic status and health of dairy cows in early lactation, whether cyanocobalamin and butaphosphan increase DMI in periparturient dairy cows, and whether the beneficial effect of Catosal is present when multiple injections are administered a.p. at the labeled dose for cattle in the United States.",
