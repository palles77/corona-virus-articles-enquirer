While previous studies examined the impact of food safety events on consumer demand for products, little attention has been paid to the impact on the market value of firms. Using the event study method (ESM), this study investigated abnormal returns (ARs) and cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) of firms associated with 40 food safety events over the past 25 years in the U.S. The results of this study demonstrated the magnitude and duration of the impact of food safety events on firm value. Moreover, firm-specific factors (past history and firm size) and situational factor (media attention) were found to influence the magnitude of the impact. This study contributes to the hospitality literature by extending the knowledge of the impact of food safety events and its practical implications for effective crisis management strategies for food-related firms.",

According to recent estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), food safety events cause 48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations, and 3000 deaths each year in the United States (Scallan et al., 2011) . The Foodborne Outbreak Reporting System (FoodNet) noted that 59% of reported foodborne illness outbreaks were associated with food-related firms such as restaurants, food manufacturers, and food distributors (CDC, 2005) . The association between food safety events and firms has been recognized in the business and economics literature. The impact of foodborne illnesses on firms has been examined from various perspectives, such as consumer demand (Piggott and Marsh, 2004; Hammit and Haninger, 2007) and changes in purchase intention (Maynard et al., 2008) . Despite these efforts, the magnitude and duration of food safety events on firm value has not received sufficient research attention. Further understanding as to what extent food safety events impact the associated firms, how long the impact lasts, and which factors contribute to the impact is of paramount importance for several reasons.",

The duration of a food safety event impact on firms, which is an indicator of the seriousness of the event, is also of great interest to crisis managers. This lack of understanding regarding the seriousness and duration of food safety events can cause food-related firms to use inappropriate crisis management strategies. Firms that disregard or underestimate the seriousness of an event might face an enormously negative situation due to inappropriate crisis management tactics. On the other hand, this lack of understanding can also cause food-related firms to invest unnecessary resources or to overreact in dealing with food safety event outbreaks.",

In order to investigate the seriousness or duration of food safety events, firms can take actions such as conducting surveys to examine consumer perceptions of the event or gathering information about the number of people affected by the event. While those measures cannot promptly capture the impact of food safety events, stock prices and stock returns show immediate market reactions based on the market's evaluation of the seriousness of potential impacts on a firm's profitability. Acknowledging that many food safety events occur accidentally, the need to examine immediate responses from the stock market is increasing. Thus, examining firm value through stock return movements can provide essential information to understand the impact of food safety events (Hsu and Jang, 2007) .",

            "text": "Third, identifying specific factors related to the seriousness and duration of the impact of food safety events may also enable crisis managers to prepare for the necessary reactions to such events. Because every event occurs in different circumstances, there are several factors, risk-related, firm-specific, and situational, that may influence the impact of events. First, risk-related factors are fundamental factors influencing consumers' perceptions of the food safety event. For example, the severity of risk or the number of people sickened may influence the magnitude of the impact on associated firms. Whether a firm executes a recall of products or not may also affect the duration of the impact. Second, firm-specific factors, such as firm size or past history, also influence the impact of food safety events. For instance, whether a firm has a past history with foodborne illness outbreaks may influence consumers' perceptions of the food safety event. Finally, situational factors may affect the seriousness and duration of the food safety event's impact on firms. The proliferation of the Internet enables information to be spread quickly and broadly, which can foster crisis communication. However, negative or distorted information can also spread even quicker than positive or correct information. In this sense, the level of media attention may heavily influence consumer responses, which are reflected in the market evaluation of a firm. The more media attention an event garners, the more negative responses are associated with the firm, which can negatively impact firm value. Thus, this study investigates how risk-related, firm-specific, and situational factors contribute to the impact of food safety events on the market value of firms.",

To fill the research gap, this study examines whether food safety events have a significant impact on the stock returns of food-related firms. Specifically, the objectives of this study are (1) to examine the magnitude and duration of impacts of food safety events on the market returns of food-related firms and (2) to identify risk-related factors, firm-specific factors, and situational factors that contribute to stock price movements of food-related firms in response to food safety events. In view of the lack of research on the financial impact of food safety events, this study contributes to the literature by extending our understanding of the consequences of food safety events and by providing empirical evidence of the duration of the impacts for food-related firms. This study also offers important information that may help crisis managers design and implement effective crisis communication strategies. Moreover, this study can help motivate employees in food-related industries to ensure the safety of foods by demonstrating the magnitude of the negative impact and potential harm to the equity of a firm.",

The food safety crisis resulted in the deaths of four children and foodborne illnesses of 700 people in multiple states that year. As a result of the crisis, Jack in the Box lost millions of dollars in sales revenue (Braun-latour et al., 2006) . In 2000, Chi-Chi's and Sizzler were involved in foodborne illnesses that led to the companies' eventual bankruptcy. ConAgra, a food manufacturer, was involved in an E. coli outbreak in 2002, which resulted in 19 people falling sick after eating tainted hamburgers. The event forced ConAgra to recall over 19 million pounds of ground beef, the third largest recall in the U.S. history (Becker, 2002) .

While a number of studies were conducted from a consumer demand perspective, the financial impacts of food safety events on firm performances have garnered little attention. For example, an event study by Henson and Mazzocchi (2002) examined the impacts of government announcements regarding a possible link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which is commonly called mad cow disease, and human health on agriculture economies in U.K. The study found that the government announcement caused significantly negative abnormal returns not only for beef processors, but also for processors of dairy products, animal feed, and pet foods as well. The study suggested that abnormal stock returns signal negative impacts of food safety events by reflecting immediate market evaluations of the firm's future value. Moreover, the authors highlighted the need to consider an extended period rather than a single day in assessing the effect of food safety related information on market evaluations. Because the impact of food safety related information on consumer demand can be delayed due to the continuous process of information collection and assimilation in response to uncertainty, examining longer-term cumulative abnormal returns is necessary. In addition, van Ravenswaay and Hoehn (1991) asserted that long term information may generate greater impact on product markets. Accordingly, understanding the financial impacts of food safety events is becoming increasingly important.",

            "text": "The event study method (ESM) has been widely used to estimate the financial impact of particular events on firms' stock returns, such as product recall announcements (Chen et al., 2009; Thomsen and McKenzie, 2001) , merger and acquisition announcements (Dodd and Warner, 1983; Hsu and Jang, 2007) , economic news (Chan, 2003) , and a banking crisis (Miyajima and Yafeh, 2007) . In essence, unexpected events or crises were found to generate significant negative abnormal stock returns, which reflect the market's negative evaluation of a firm's future value. Previous hospitality research has examined the impacts of negative events, such as terrorism on hospitality stocks (Chang and Zeng, 2011) , food recalls on food-related firms (Salin and Hooker, 2001) , the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak on hotel stocks (Chen et al., 2007) , and IT news on hospitality stocks (Lee and Connolly, 2010) . The advantage of using ESM is that it identifies stock price movements due to firm-specific events. In addition, ESM captures immediate market reactions that are reflected in daily stock returns. Moreover, ESM makes it possible to examine the cumulative impacts of specific events, indicating the duration of the impact of food safety events on associated firms. Thus, ESM is an appropriate method for examining the impact of food safety events on firm value.",

If the value of AR is negative, the event is unfavorable and leads to the prediction of negative future profitability. Cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) indicate the cumulative impacts of particular events. Previous research suggests that the initial press announcement does not provide sufficient information to investors because investors are not able to accurately gauge the response to the events (Wiles and Danielova, 2009) . Extending the event window is suggested in order to judge cumulative impacts and can be applied to the case of food safety events (Wiles and Danielova, 2009 ). When risk is considered minimal, stock prices may not react to the event after a press announcement of the event. Yet if the risk is viewed as severe, investors may evaluate the value of the firm significantly negatively, resulting in significant abnormal returns. Accordingly, this study used a long-term event window for calculating abnormal returns (ARs) and cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) after the event outbreak date. The prediction is summarized as below:",

Thus, food safety events may not necessarily lead to significant negative stock returns when proactive recalls are properly executed. However, Salin and Hooker (2001) and Chen et al. (2009) asserted that proactive recall strategies generated more negative abnormal returns than passive recalls because the market tends to evaluate the proactive recall announcement as a signal of a severe crisis.

SCCT asserted that a history of crises has an indirect effect on the relationship between crisis responsibility and reputational threat to an organization (Coombs, 2004) . A past crisis similar to a current crisis indicates that the crisis occurs regularly rather than irregularly, resulting in higher crisis attribution or responsibility. If a firm is perceived as highly responsible for a crisis outbreak, people are more likely to have a negative reaction compared to a firm with no crisis history. Due to the influence of past crisis history on reputational threat, a firm must determine its crisis response strategies accordingly. This notion is used to design theory-based matching systems between response strategy and crisis situation in order to protect an organization's reputation. Different crisis response strategies may have different effects on firm value. Moreover, a consumer's long-term memory system may influence information processing in response to food crises. Resonance theory (Wan, 2008) contends that people process information through an automatic cognitive procedure when they make an association between a stimulus and their longterm memory. People tend to make an association between a firm and an event more readily when the event occurs repeatedly. A firm that has been associated with food safety events in the past may elicit more negative responses because people more easily associate the firm with the negative event. Thus, a past history with food safety events will be associated with more negative abnormal stock returns. The hypothesis is summarized as follows:",

Some studies (e.g., Salin and Hooker, 2001) found that firm size had a positive effect, suggesting that large firms benefit from brand equity and reputation. In particular, the negative effect of a recall strategy was more severe and immediate for smaller firms than larger firms (e.g., Salin and Hooker, 2001) . In addition, consumers perceived less risk of failure in highly reputable firms than in less reputable firms (Roehm and Brady, 2007) . In contrast, negative effects of firm size were also observed. For example, smaller firms showed larger positive excess stock returns than larger firms in response to earning announcements (Grant, 1980; Atiase, 1985) and dividend increase announcements (Bajaj and Vijh, 1995) . In negative situations such as crisis or service failures, consumers had more negative reactions to the failure of large firms (high equity brands) than small firms (low brand equity brands) based on the perceived betrayal of a firm they trusted (Gregoire et al., 2009) . Moreover, Borde et al. (1999) argued that more information is available for large firms listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) than small firms listed on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX). This information asymmetry may also have a negative influence for large firms in a crisis situation.

The importance of the media in shaping consumers' perceptions and behaviors has been studied since the argument of McLuhan (1964, p. 8 ) \"the medium is the message\". McLuhan (1964) asserted that a variety of forms of media such as print media (e.g., newspaper, tabloid magazine), audio media (e.g., radio), and visual media (e.g., television, on-line video clips) are critical factors influencing social discourse. Due to the recent technological developments, the forms of media have become more diverse including social media which is becoming one of the major communication tools (Syed-Ahmad and Murphy, 2010) . The user-created nature of social media may increase the danger of disseminating negative information, which limits the controllability of firms under crisis situations (Palen, 2008) . Due to the diverse forms of media serving as communication channels, the influence of media on the general public is increasing.",

However, in reality information asymmetry has been detected, resulting in unpredictable stock price movements. In studying the impact of media on stock price movements, there are two types of traders, noise traders who hold random beliefs about future value of firms and rational arbitrageurs who hold systematic (Bayesian) beliefs (Tetlock, 2007) . Information delivered by media may contain both noise and factual information. Investors make decisions based on their evaluation of the proportion of fact and noise. In order to investigate the impact of media reporting on stock returns, Tetlock (2007) examined the relationship between the new contents of the Wall Street Journal and daily stock returns, asserting that high media pessimism, such as negative or vague words, predicts temporary decreases in stock returns. Unlike studies focusing on financial crisis news (Swary, 1986; Ellis and Lewis, 2000) , the effect of other types of crisis-related information may display different patterns. For example, Chen et al. (2007) examined stock reactions of hotels in Taiwan to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), an infectious disease caused by a virus resulting in acute respiratory distress. The results of Chen et al.'s (2007) study indicated significant negative abnormal returns persisting over 30 days past the outbreak. Although the study did not examine the role of media in reporting SARS, media may play a critical role in delivering and spreading related information to the public that resulted in the negative influence on hotel stocks. Thus, this study hypothesized the effect of media attention on stock returns of food-related firms as follows:",

(2009) . Lastly, media attention was determined by the number of news reports covering the outbreak: under 100 (low media attention: 0) or over 100 (high media attention: 1) which divided the sampled firms into two groups. The news reports were retrieved using LexisNexis database by identifying \"all news\" which contains the search keywords that were combined with restaurant name and foodborne pathogen. For example, 'Taco Bell and E. coli\" was used as a keyword to identify news reports covering the Taco Bell events associated with E. coli. Operationalization of the variables is summarized in Table 1 . This study determined firm value based on daily stock prices, instead of accounting-based performance measures such as return on assets (ROA) and return of equity (ROE), in order to measure the impact of the food safety events. Accounting data are available on a quarterly basis, which limits the ability to capture the impact of specific events. In contrast, stock prices reflect immediate market reactions to any event, so stock price returns are a good indicator of the market's evaluation of a firm's value (Fama, 1970; Hsu and Jang, 2007) . Thus, examining the pattern of stock price returns in response to food safety events would provide evidence of significant short-term negative impacts of food safety events on firm value. Furthermore, identifying risk-specific, firm-specific and situational factors contributing to stock price movements provides valuable insight to the financial impacts of food safety events on food-related firms.",

The reporting is typically initiated by identifying the victims, then examination procedures are conducted by government agencies, and, finally, the cases and risk exposures are confirmed.

In order to examine the seriousness of food safety event impacts, we tested whether AR (or CAR) since the outbreak is significantly different from zero or not. To achieve the goal, the t-test was considered the most appropriate method to determine the significance of difference between AR (or CAR) and zero. Table 3 presents the results of event study analyses on daily abnormal returns of firms in response to food safety events. Abnormal returns (ARs) were calculated as the difference between expected stock returns and actual stock returns. Cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) were calculated as the sum of ARs. Negative AR or CAR indicates the negative impact of an event on firm value. A t-test was performed to investigate whether AR or CAR is significantly different from zero, since abnormal returns may not be zero if significantly influenced by any events.",

However, the result does not necessarily suggests that recall strategies are not effective in crisis situations because this study did not examine the effect of other recall-related factors, such as the magnitude of a recall or the type of products recalled. Moreover, the sampled events contain a variety of firms including restaurants, food manufacturers, and food distributors. For example, food safety events associated with food manufacturers are more likely to be accompanied by a recall because they can eliminate the potential risk by removing problematic products; however, restaurant-associated food safety events are primarily caused by mistakes in the process of serving food to people. Thus, restaurants can change their suppliers, sanitize restaurant spaces, and close problematic stores to ensure the safety of foods; recalling products does not apply to the case of restaurants. This inherent difference in the type of operations included in the sample of this study may explain the insignificant effect of recall strategy on stock market returns of firms.",

In other words, firms with a past history suffered less severe impacts compared to firms that had no prior food safety events. This result contradicts our expectations; however, this could be partially explained by an incomplete recovery or enhanced communication skills in firms with a \"history.\" If a firm has not fully recovered from a previous crisis, the change in stock returns (reduction rate) may not be as extreme as that of a first time \"offender\". Although a firm may seem to have suffered from less severe impacts, the smaller changes may be simply due to an incomplete recovery from the past crises.

One significant finding of this study is that daily abnormal returns (ARs) were significantly negative on the first day (t 1 ) and the second day (t 2 ) following the outbreak of events. Cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) were found to be significantly negative until the 57th trading day since the outbreak, supporting that discernable negative impacts diminished approximately two working months after the event. Furthermore, negative CARs turned to positive values after 264 trading days, indicating that it took almost one year to fully recover from food safety events. Moreover, the effect of factors contributing to the impact of food safety events on food-related firms was also examined: risk-related, firm-specific, and situational factors. While none of the risk-related factors (severity of risk and recall execution) were significant, both firm-specific factors (past history and firm size) and situational factor (media attention) were significant determinants of the impact of food safety events on the firms. In summary, the significant impact of food safety events on food-related firms (H1), the effect of past history (H4), the effect of firm size (H5), and the effect of media attention (H6) were supported, while the effect of severity of risk (H2) and the effect of recall execution (H3) were not supported in this study.

The significant effect of a past history of food safety events implied that a first-time food safety event can cause disastrous results, which is inconsistent with the results of previous research (Coombs, 2004 (Coombs, , 2007 . The previous studies asserted that a past history may intensify the attrition of a firm in the crisis, negatively affecting the reputation of the firm. However, even a one-time event can generate disastrous results, as supported by the case of Chi-Chi's in 2003. Chi-Chi's, a national Mexican chain restaurant, was involved in a hepatitis A outbreak in 2003 and closed its operation in 2004 due to a tainted brand image and negative publicity. Thus, it is difficult to conclude that restaurants that have never experienced food safety events in the past are safe from the risk to the extreme impact of food safety events. Another firm-specific factor, firm size, was found to be significant. This finding suggests that large firms experienced less severe impacts than small firms, which is inconsistent with previous studies asserting the advantages of large firms compared to small firms (Salin and Hooker, 2001; Roehm and Brady, 2007) . Large firms can take more effective actions, such as advertisement, campaigns, and promotions, to recover their tainted brand image, whereas small firms may not have sufficient resources to recover from crises.

As the power of media was found to become stronger over time, the importance of effective communication through media is increasing. The amplifying effect of media attention on the magnitude and duration of a food safety event on a firm's market value offers a plausible explanation to the fact that the impact of a SARS outbreak in Taiwan on hotels' stocks persisted over 30 days, a phenomenon raised but unanswered by Chen et al.

By initiating research on the impacts of food safety events on stock market evaluations of food-related firms, this study provides opportunities for future studies to use other measurements, such as consumer surveys. Second, the results of this study offer several important implications for practitioners. Having pre-crisis management strategies along with post-crisis communication strategies is important in handling crisis situations in a way that protects a firm's reputation during a crisis. The results regarding a past history with food safety events reinforce the importance of having pre-crisis management strategies for food-related firms. To develop an effective pre-crisis management strategy, training and education of food employees in terms of food safety is of paramount importance. A recent study by Medeiros et al. (2012) suggested that restaurants' human resource administration should focus on the provisions of food safety information through hiring, evaluating, and training of food-handling employees. The effectiveness of food safety training has also been confirmed by other studies (Murphy et al., 2011; Seaman and Eves, 2006; Soon and Baines, 2012) . The findings converge to suggest that proper food safety training contributes to safer food handling practices, which in turn, reduces the possibility of food crises.",

First, the actual number of food safety events is limited in order to apply ESM, with only firms that are listed on stock market were included in the study. Future research with a larger sample size may allow researchers to better investigate the effect of food safety events on firm value. Second, since the event study method was designed to measure the shortterm impact of events, it was not possible to estimate the long-term impact of food safety events in this study. Future studies can adopt different study methods such as longitudinal analysis to examine long-term financial impacts of food safety events. Lastly, the type of operations may alter the influence of food safety events on financial performance of firms, which can be explored by future studies using a larger sample. By building on the knowledge gained from this study, future studies can further extend our understanding of the impacts of food safety events.",
