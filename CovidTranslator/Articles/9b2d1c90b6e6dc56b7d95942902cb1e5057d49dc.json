Non-structural 1 (NS1) protein, an indispensable component for efficient virus replication, can be used as a potential target for generating new antiviral agents. Here, we study the interaction of 2H6 monoclonal antibody with NS1 protein and also determine whether influenza virus replication can be inhibited by blocking NS1. The 2H6-antigen binding fragment (Fab) forms a multimeric complex with the NS1 RNA-binding domain (RBD). T49, a residue which forms a direct hydrogen bond with double stranded RNA, in NS1 protein was found to be critical for its interaction with 2H6 antibody. NS1(RBD) has high affinity to 2H6 with K D of 43.5 \u00b1 4.24 nM whereas NS1(RBD)-T49A has more than 250 times lower affinity towards 2H6. Interestingly, the intracellular expression of 2H6single-chain variable fragment (scFv) in mammalian cells caused a reduction in viral growth and the M1 viral protein level was significantly reduced in 2H6-scFv transfected cells in comparison to vector transfected cells at 12 h post infection. These results indicate that the tight binding of 2H6 to NS1 could lead to reduction in viral replication and release of progeny virus. In future, 2H6 antibody in combination with other neutralizing antibodies can be used to increase the potency of viral inhibition.",

Despite many advances, IAVs are still a challenge for the scientists. IAVs are highly contagious and causative agents of seasonal flu epidemics resulting in morbidity, mortality and huge economic losses. Based on the circulating strains, seasonal influenza vaccines are developed annually or biannually, if needed, by WHO but the immunity provided is short-lived due to continuous change in the virus strains. Therefore, vaccination is usually required every year to be protected from seasonal flu that leads to increase in vaccine cost along with shortage of vaccines in developing countries. But the two main problems with vaccination are the time required to select, manufacture and deliver vaccine and the variable annual immunization rates (Couch, 2008) . Besides vaccination, the antiviral agents are the therapeutic options to treat the infection. Antivirals against M2 protein and neuraminidase are available but their irrational use has led to the emergence of resistant strains (Agrawal et al., 2010; Hayden and Hay, 1992; Poland et al., 2009) . Thus, there is a continued requirement of new antiviral agents against IAV.",

NS1 has two functionally distinct domains: the N-terminal RNA binding domain (RBD), consisting of three a-helices, and the C-terminal effector domain, consisting of seven b-strands and three a-helices. The RBD domain binds with low affinity to several RNA species in a sequence independent manner (Chien et al., 2004; Hatada and Fukuda, 1992; Qian et al., 1995) , and effector domain predominantly interacts with host-cell proteins and also functionally stabilizes RBD domain (Wang et al., 2002) . NS1, a well conserved protein, is expressed at very high levels in infected cells (Krug and Etkind, 1973; Palese and Shaw, 2007) . Therefore, NS1 protein is a good target for therapeutics development and several small molecules have been found to inhibit NS1 function resulting in reduced viral replication (Engel, 2013; Nayak et al., 2014; Woo et al., 2013) . In our previous study, we generated a panel of new monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the RNA binding domain of NS1 (NS1(RBD)) . Here we report the biophysical characterization of one of these mAbs, named as 2H6, and NS1(RBD) protein interaction, and inhibition of viral replication by targeting NS1 protein in infected cells. 2H6 has been shown to bind to NS1 of different IAV subtypes, namely H5N1, H3N2 and H1N1 .",

Dynamic light scattering (DLS) was performed on the fraction containing this complex and the results reveal that it is homogenous and has an estimated molecular weight of 400 kDa (see Supplementary Fig. S3 ). Given that NS1(RBD) exists as a dimer of $18 kDa, binding to 2H6-Fab of $50 kDa will yield an expected size of $120 kDa assuming the complex has a globular structure. This may imply that the antigen-antibody complex is actually multimeric in nature. The occurrence of multimeric antigen-antibody complex has been reported in several studies (Sanny and Price, 1997; Santora et al., 2001) . However, it cannot be ruled out that the complex does not have a globular structure and hence, show non-ideal chromatographic behavior.

Since the side-chains of residues S42 and T49 make direct hydrogen bond with the double stranded RNA (dsRNA) backbone and dsRNA binding affinity is reduced by up to 10-fold when either of them is mutated (Cheng et al., 2009) , two substitution mutants, NS1(RBD)-S42A and NS1(RBD)-T49A, were generated. To determine if these residues in NS1 are critical for interaction with 2H6, we performed a comparative ELISA (Fig. 3A) . The results show that NS1(RBD) and NS1(RBD)-S42A bound comparably to 2H6 at all the antigen con-centrations tested, while the binding of NS1(RBD)-T49A was significantly decreased when 0.125 or 0.031 lg/mL of protein was used for coating. No binding to Bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was used as a negative control, was observed. A double substitution mutant NS1(RBD)-R38AK41A was also tested because these two residues, which lie upstream of the 2H6 binding domain, have previously been shown to be important for RNA binding (Wang et al., 1999) . The NS1(RBD)-R38AK41A mutant has similar binding to 2H6 as NS1(RBD) confirming that residues upstream of S42 are not likely to be involved in the interaction.",

The kinetics of association and dissociation were recorded in SPR sensorgram. The kinetic rate constants kon and koff were determined from the ascending rate of resonance units during association and the descending rate during dissociation. The results show that NS1(RBD) has high affinity to 2H6 with K D of 43.5 \u00b1 4.24 nM (Fig. 3B) whereas NS1(RBD)-T49A has a significantly lower affinity (K D = 12.1 \u00b1 1.28 lM) (Fig. 3C) , indicating that the T49 residue is important for strong binding between NS1 and 2H6. The CD spectrum of NS1(RBD)-T49A reveals that its secondary structure is similar to that of NS1(RBD) (Fig. 1A) , indicating the substitution does not cause gross structural change.",

The average reduction in normalized M1 expression in 2H6-scFv transfected cells when compared to vector and 7G12-scFv transfected cells at 12 hpi is 27% and 49% respectively.

            "text": "Our results show that the murine mAb 2H6 binds tightly to the NS1 protein and the affinity of this interaction is significantly reduced when T49 is substituted by A. When the 2H6-scFv is expressed intracellularly, it binds to NS1 expressed in the infected cells and caused a significant reduction in viral protein expression and release of progeny virus. Since the side-chains of T49 are involved in RNA binding (Cheng et al., 2009) , it is likely that the binding of 2H6 has a negative impact on the ability of NS1 to bind to RNA and hence, resulting in a reduction of viral replication. NS1 is a viable drug target as it is involved in various processes that are crucial for viral replication and propagation (Hale et al., 2008) . In the past, few small chemical compounds have been shown to inhibit both NS1 function and virus replication (Basu et al., 2009; Walkiewicz et al., 2011) . But the precise mechanisms of action of these chemical compounds are still unknown and remain to be elucidated. Earlier, the function of CPSF30 binding site of the NS1 has been shown to be inhibited by the second and third zinc fingers (F2F3), a 61 residues fragment of CPSF30, resulting in the inhibition of IAV replication without detectable effects on cellular functions (Twu et al., 2006) . Our approach of expressing 2H6-scFv in the cells to block IAV replication during infection is similar to their method of expressing F2F3 intracellularly to bind NS1 and inhibit its interaction with CPSF30. Interestingly, a recent publication has also reported the abilities of 3 NS1 specific-human scFvs to inhibit replication of influenza A virus (Yodsheewan et al., 2013) . However, the mechanisms of binding are different as they bound to residues 7-18, 75-90 and 179-190 of NS1, respectively.",

In future studies, it will be important to use a combination of different NS1 inhibiting molecules to determine if this can increase the potency of viral inhibition and/or minimize the chance of viral escape both in vitro and in vivo. Delivery of antibody or scFv into the cells is an important aspect of antiviral therapy. Thus, viral expression vectors such as adenovirus or lentivirus can be used for 2H6-scFv delivery. Moreover, cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP), a stretch of basic residues, has been extensively documented for its efficient delivery of biomolecules (Gump and Dowdy, 2007; Kim et al., 2006) . Recently, hepatitis B virus replication has been reported to be inhibited by intracellular delivery of scFv against core protein via CTP (Xun et al., 2013) . As an alternative to viral expression vectors, 2H6-scFv can be fused with CTP for the efficient cytoplasmic translocation of the scFv into the cells. The expression levels of M1 were showed in graphs after normalization with actin. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the average values with standard deviations are plotted. Differences in M1 expression between 2H6-scFv and vector transfected cells or between 2H6-scFv and 7G12-scFv transfected cells were evaluated by unpaired t-test ( \u2044 , p < 0.05; \u2044\u2044\u2044 , p < 0.001).",
