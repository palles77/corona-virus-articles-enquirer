Emergency departments, being the primary portal of entry into the hospitals, had to come up with rapid strategic changes and modifications to accommodate and manage this public health problem effectively. This report discusses the changes in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Singapore General Hospital, the largest public, teaching and tertiary hospital in Singapore, during this outbreak. It will highlight the safety aspects and universal precautions undertaken, the changes to the triage system, working hours, admission policies, as well as the fluctuations in the patient load.

            "text": "Pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrheal diseases, malaria, measles and HIV/AIDS annually account for half of all premature deaths from infectious diseases. The situation is of course more urgent in developing countries. More ominous is the fact that the World Health Organization (WHO) has, in the last 20 years, reported 30, either new or reemerging diseases. These include infections with Hantavirus, Marburg and Ebola viruses, diphtheria, meningitis, dengue and typhus. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) represents one such newly emerging illness. 1 SARS represent a newly identified clinical illness linked to an outbreak of atypical viral pneumonia in the Guangdong province in China. The agent causing SARS is tentatively identified as a coronavirus. The incubation period is between 2 and 10 days and the illness begins with a prodrome of fever, often accompanied by headache, malaise, myalgia, and mild respiratory symptoms. This then progresses to a lower respiratory phase with dry nonproductive cough and/or dyspnea, which may be accompanied by or progress to hypoxemia. Between 10% to 20% of patients may require intubation and mechanical ventilation. The clinical picture is variable especially in the presence of comorbidity, amongst those on steroids, with immunocompromised states as well as advanced age. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] In Singapore, there are 6 public general hospitals and one of these is entirely dedicated for women and children. Singapore General Hospital is the largest public, teaching hospital in Singapore, which offers tertiary, multidisciplinary care. Services such as Neurosurgery, Cardiothoracic Surgery, and 24-hour percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty are available. The emergency department (ED) at Singapore General Hospital is one of the busiest in the country and handles approximately 120,000 visits annually. The ED is staffed by 12 emergency physicians, 22 medical officers, and 108 nursing staff. The department has 24-hour consultant coverage and it sees a wide range of cases, which include trauma, medical and surgical emergencies, as well as urgent ambulatory problems. There is a 30-bed short-stay emergency observation ward and an 8-bed Emergency Cardiac Care Unit, run by the emergency physicians.",

Fans were used to cool and ventilate the room. The other area consisted of 2 cubicles in the critical care area (CCA). These were more suitable for nonambulatory patients. The heavy sliding doors between these cubicles and the other cubicles were kept closed at all times. Staff entering these areas and treating patients with suspected SARS changed their gowns, masks, and gloves upon exit. Two medical officers per shift were scheduled to provide consult for these suspected cases. This was done to minimize contact of such cases with staff members. As the number of patients with fever, cough, dyspnea, and a history of SARS exposure increased, more consultation rooms were required. As such, rapid retrofitting and redesign was performed in the ED to create and partition separate areas for these patients to be seen and treated. An entirely new \"fever wing\" was created in this way. This concept made it less likely for those with fever to mingle with the rest of the ED patients and personnel.

Teaching in the ED was restricted to minimal and activities such as journal clubs and case conferences were cancelled. In March and April 2003, the ED had to delay attachments for some of the following; 4. Fourth year medical students' Emergency Medicine rotation and 5. Premedical college students' attachment This was made possible with the cooperation and understanding of the deans and heads of these institutions of higher learning. Training programs and classes such as Basic Cardiac Life Support and First Aid also had lower attendance. A planned mass Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) training session for the public had to be delayed as well. Several members of the research staff were requested to stay away form the hospital during this outbreak.",

The ED represents the primary portal of entry into any hospital. Thus, emergency physicians and all ED staff play a crucial and central role in the identification, subsequent management and correct referral to a designated SARS hospital. The ability to expeditiously respond to such an event depends on the state of preparedness of the ED and its staff. Their ability to adapt rapidly to the changes in working hours, dressing style, as well as functional and structural reorganization in the ED, is sine qua non. The close surveillance, extra efforts, and fullhearted compliance with protocols by everyone played a crucial role in the control of SARS in Singapore.",
