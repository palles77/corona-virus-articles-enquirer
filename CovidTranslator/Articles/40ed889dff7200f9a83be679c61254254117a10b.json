            "text": "Viruses are obligate parasites that can infect most prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in nature. Viruses contain either DNA or RNA as their genomic material. Essentially, the viral genome is made up of three types of genes: (a) genes encoding enzymes required for the replication of the viral genome; (b) genes encoding proteins involved in regulatory processes; and (c) genes that encode the viral structural proteins such as capsid and envelope proteins. The smaller DNA viruses such as polyoma and SV40 (parvoviruses and papovaviruses), which are similar to phages Ff and ~bX174 in size (5-kb genome size), produce virulent infections and rely almost entirely on the host replication machinery. The intermediate size viruses, such as A phages (48-kb genome size), induce the production of a few enzymes of their own but depend primarily on host enzymes. However, larger viruses, such as herpes and vaccinia viruses (100-to 300-kb genome size) and phages such as T4 and T7, contain several genes encoding multiple enzymes that direct the synthesis of precursor proteins as well as a relatively complete and independent replicative apparatus. 1,2",

By such sequence comparisons it has been shown that the amino acid sequence of the DNA polymerase from bacteriophage SPO2 is homologous to the polymerase domain of the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I from Escherichia coli. The same regions are also related to the enzyme from other species, such as Staphylococcuspneumoniae, Thermus aquaticus, and bacteriophages T7 and T5. 3'4 The sequence alignments among these polymerases indicate at least three conserved motifs in these proteins. Similarly, sequence alignments of various RNA-directed polymerases have revealed four conserved motifs. Two of these motifs are common among Figure 1 depicts these conserved motifs for a number of DNA-and RNA-dependent polymerases from different sources. Even though these motifs encompass only a few invariant amino acids, the validity of these alignments is generally supported by genetic studies that have demonstrated a critical role for these residues in the catalytic function of these polymerases. 6-1\u00b0 For example, the invariant DD in motif 3 of RNA-dependent DNA polymerases is thought to be at the polymerase active site.",

H-13 Furthermore, the conservation of these homologous regions across a vast phylogenetic expanse indicates that these prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA polymerases may have evolved from a common primordial gene. ~2 These conserved consensus sequences are suggested to define potential sites that serve essential roles in the DNA polymerasecatalyzed reactions. By a careful comparison of the viral genome sequences with the existing known motifs, it is possible to delineate the region encoding for the specific polymerase. For example, by using this approach, RNA polymerase from hepatitis C virus 14 [1] hepatitis B virus is have been identified, expressed, and purified. Further evidence for the close structural relatedness of polymerases from diverse sources comes from X-ray crystallography studies. A pattern of structural similarity has been identified in the crystal structures of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase 16 and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase 117 and T7 RNA polymerase. TM Although there are a few conserved amino acid residues in different motifs of these polymerases and although polymerases may share common structural and functional features, no single method can be generalized to purify all polymerases. However, the requirement for polymerases to bind either DNA or RNA (the template) has been extensively used in their purification and in the purification of many other DNA-binding proteins. In addition, substrates and specific inhibitors have been used as affinity ligands for the purification of polymerases. For related polymerases (from the same family of viruses), published procedures can be used as a starting point and modifications be made along the way to improve the specific activity, purity, and recovery of the enzyme.",

It is best to start with a source that produces a decent amount of the required enzyme in a soluble form. Expression of proteins in bacteria does not always produce the enzyme in its native, soluble, and biologically active conformation. Instead, overproduction of the enzyme of interest may result in the formation of insoluble aggregates (inclusion bodies) within the host cell. 2l'33 Isolation of enzymes from inclusion bodies requires a denaturationrenaturation step and thus can introduce uncertainties regarding proper folding of the enzyme. If expression in a bacterial system results in the formation of inclusion bodies, factors such as host strain, incubation temperature, and length of incubation can be varied.

In practice, the conditions for adsorption will have to be found empirically. Even if the polymerase does not bind to any of the exchangers under the conditions used, a high degree of purification is possible due to the retention of other host-related proteins onto the column. For determining the optimal conditions, the three pH-related properties of the enzyme that should be considered are (a) the isoelectric point (pI), (b) the optimum pH for activity, and (c) the pH stability range. If the pI of an enzyme is 5 or below, that does not mean that it is stable at pH 5 or can be handled at pH 5. Table III gives a general list for choosing the appropriate ion exchanger, with the assumption that the polymerases are stable only in the pH 5.5 to 8.5 range. Information regarding the isoelectric point of the enzyme can be useful in deciding the choice of column and buffer conditions cal conditions the charge on the nucleic acids is pH independent, and thus generally they elute in the salt concentration range of 0.5-1.0 M.

The technique relies on the affinity between hydrophobic groups such as phenyl-or octylin the matrix and regions of hydrophobicity on the protein surface. Hydrophobic interactions become stronger with increasing salt concentrations. Thus, HIC can be run either after an ammonium sulfate step or ion-exchange chromatography. Phenyl agarose chromatography has been used in the purification of human DNA polymerase ~.28,35 Table V summarizes the steps used in the purification of several polymerases from various sources. The most widely used steps in the purification of polymerases are phosphocellulose and heparin Sepharose chromatography. Proteins usually do not bind to cation exchangers at salt concentrations higher than 0.5 M at pH ~7.5, because at this pH, even proteins having a high isoelectric point do not have high net positive charge that would be required for a strong interaction with a cation-exchange resin. There are specific interactions between phosphocellulose and enzymes that interact with phosphorylated substrates. Phosphorylated nonreducing ends of the cellulose can bind to the dNTP or primer/template-binding sites on the polymerases and, in many cases, high salt concentrations are needed to break this pseudo-specific binding interaction. The column in fact works as a pseudo-affinity column rather than an ion exchanger. On the same principle, heparin, which is a sulfated polysaccharide and highly negatively charged, mimics the anionic charge of nucleic acids. Immobilized heparin has been used as a pseudo-affinity column in the pH range 7.2 to 7.5 with the elution of polymerase in high salt. One or both of these columns are used in most of the purification procedures described in this volume. 14,24,26,28,29,31,32",

Maintaining enzymes at pH <6.0 or >8.0 for a long duration can result in a decrease in enzyme activity. Column matrices such as fast-flow Sepharose Q (anion exchanger) and Sepharose S (cation exchanger, both from Pharmacia) are excellent exchange resins because they can handle faster flow rates. FPLC columns Mono S and Mono Q (Pharmacia) are very useful in final stages of purification for their high resolution capabilities. These columns have been used for purification of HSV polymerase, 28 adenovirus polymerase (Ad-Pol),Z4 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of HepC, 14 human DNA polymerase, 28,35 and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase. 32 Nucleic acids are often a major contaminant with polymerases.

If the sequence of the enzyme is known from the cDNA sequence, amino acid composition can also give an idea of purity. Immunological methods such as immunoblotting are a very sensitive and simple technique for detecting host cell proteins. Antibodies to E. coli or yeast proteins are commercially available. Enzymelabeled (alkaline phosphatase or peroxidase) antibodies have been used to visualize very small amounts of antibody-antigen complexes. In recent years, mass spectrometric methods have emerged as powerful tools for protein characterization. 42 One of these techniques employs electrospray ionization in which multiply charged ion species are produced, thus lowering the mass to charge ratio values for an accurate determination of molecular weights. 43'44 In the matrix-assisted laser desorption time-offlight instrument, protein samples in the presence of certain matrices such as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid are ionized with an ultraviolet laser beam and the mass of the molecules is analyzed. 45'46 Homogeneity of the HIV-1 RT 42 G.

Extraction volumes should be kept minimal and the composition of the buffer should preserve enzyme activity. The method used for the lysis of cells largely depends on the nature of cells. Animal cells grown in tissue culture can be lysed with hand-held or motor-driven homogenizers in hypotonic buffers. Bacterial and yeast cells can be disrupted by agitation with glass beads. For small volumes (<1 ml), sonication is a convenient method. Pressure cells such as French Press (-50 ml), Microfluidizer, and Manton-Gaulin Press (150-1000 ml) are efficient means of lysis. It is always a good idea to monitor the extent of cell breakage through direct microscopic examination and by monitoring enzyme activity.
