Consequentialism: See Utilitarianism, including teleology. Deontology: Also called duty ethics from deon (Greek), a binding duty. This theory stresses the intrinsic value of all individual persons, the duty of individual dignity and respect, the value of self-determination, and the cardinal importance of patient autonomy. In secular philosophy, this theory draws heavily on the writings of Kant (1724-1804), and its essence is captured by the claim that individuals should always be treated as ends in themselves and not as means to other persons' ends. Resource allocation: It is useful to distinguish between three levels: (1) Microallocation refers to the one-onone encounter between patient and caregiver and is dominated usually by duty-based or deontological ethics.",

Risk/Benefit: To the deontologist, this ratio (or calculus) refers to the risk taken and the benefit achieved by a given individual in a given situation. It should be distinguished from the concept of risk to the risk taker balanced against the benefit to another, others or society as a whole, although that calculus may have to be made in some situations using a utilitarian approach.

For some, ethics is the study of behavior between people in relationships in accordance with their cultural values, whereas morals takes into account some wider principles that govern personal behavior, independently of others but often in relation to transcendental principles or beliefs or concept of deity. In this chapter, we use the two words morals and ethics synonymously. This claim is based on the origins of both words-one from ancient Greek (ethos) and the other from classical Latin (mores)-both meaning the accepted customs and values to which societies and cultures aspire. As transplantation becomes increasingly globalized, it is important to consider whether the values that are brought to bear on transplant issues are determined by local cultures or are universal (held by all world cultures). There is a lack of uniformity. We claim that all cultures share some values (e.g., it is wrong to abuse children, it is wrong to torture the innocent, and life is of utmost value to each individual). It also is true, however, that some values are held in a different way in different cultures (e.g., individual autonomy versus Utilitarianism: The other well-known tradition in ethics.",

Neither theory can be exclusively applied; both serve to bring relevant ethical perspectives into debate of difficult issues. In transplantation, because of the severely limited resource of available transplantable organs, transplant teams, while being aware of their deontological obligations to each patient, are forced to draw more on utilitarian considerations in making allocative decisions. Considerable ethical tension is created by this mesolevel obligation to utility (greatest good for the greatest number) because of the tendency for it to override duty owed to each individual as a unique person, at the microallocative level. Justice comes into play insofar as we try to treat like cases alike (the principle of equity).

Long-term results for kidney transplants from this source are comparable to those from brain-dead sources. 77 According to the Maastricht classification, 60 there are five main categories of non-heart-beating donors. Categories 1 and 2 are termed uncontrolled, referring to donors who die suddenly and unexpectedly. Categories 3 and 4 refer to controlled situations, where death of the donor is expected, usually after the withdrawal of life-sustaining measures. The debate on non-heart-beating donors has highlighted the difficulty of finding a specific moment to declare death. It may be more appropriate to think of death as a process rather than a finite event.

This measure promotes public altruism. Several studies indicated that despite a high percentage of the public being in favor of using organs from deceased donors for transplantation, low organ availability rates were caused partly by poor collaboration by health care professionals who are not involved in transplantation. Required request, required consideration, and required notification policies have been introduced widely, especially in North America, to improve collaboration, although initial improvements in obtaining organs have not always been maintained. Other measures to facilitate the process are organ removal permission statements on driver's licenses, tax returns, or other repeatedly used public documents.

It is possible that such legislation is more acceptable in societies that are more homogeneous, although Singapore may be an exception. Since changing to a system of presumed consent, Singapore's rates of donation from deceased donors have increased significantly. 57 In a study of 13 Asian countries, Singapore had the highest rate of kidney donors at 21.4/1 million population. 110 Spain achieved a 2004 procurement rate of 34.6/1 million population 91 by means of a centralized, coordinated in-hospital system, with individuals specially trained in detecting prospective donors and approaching families to obtain permission. 65 The 2004 rate is consistent with Spain's trend of continued increase in annual procurement. The 2002 donation rate was 33.7/1 million population-a number that far exceeded rates in other parts of Europe, which range from 10.4 to 24.3/1 million population donors. 21 The Spanish success may be partly due to the built-in financial incentives given to the hospitals, physicians, and coordinators involved in organ procurement. 62 Another contributing factor may be that many of the coordinators are themselves hospital intensive care specialists, nephrologists, or anesthesiologists, 18,65 although they do not coordinate for the donors who had been their own patients before death. To some individuals, these issues raise the question of conflict of interest. For these reasons, the model may not be adopted easily by other countries that lack the same level of social cohesiveness and trust.",

Suggested incentives fall into two classes: (1) proposals that anticipate death and prepare advance incentives to donate after death and (2) proposals that apply without prior planning to recently bereaved families. The former include creating a futures market, 19 or creating a priority system, such as LifeSharers. Members of LifeSharers agree to give their organs on death to individuals who also agreed to eventual postmortem organ donation. If the organ cannot be matched to a fellow member, it is made available to a nonmember. 107 LifeSharers encourages people to join while healthy by imposing a 180-day waiting period before a new member can be allocated an organ. 11 The second category includes \"ethical incentives,\" such as reimbursement of funeral expenses, 38 providing postmortem educational grants for bereaved children, or providing other insurance policies that become active only after donation from a deceased donor. 71 This category could include such public acknowledgment of societal indebtedness as the planting of a tree in a park or awarding donor families a medal. 80 All of these incentives have been framed as programs of rewarded gifting. 28 Much more controversial (see later) is the use of cash payments as direct incentives for organ donation. Individuals who oppose all these suggestions believe that they may lead to a lessening of the spirit of altruism in society and a descent into commercialization of organs and usage of the body and lessened societal value in the uniqueness and dignity of the human body. There is widespread repugnance over commercialism in organs from the deceased through sale or purchase, although few oppose compensation for any additional expenses incurred by the family as a result of organ procurement. Efforts to thwart the buying and selling of organs from living donors have been ineffective in many countries, and the practice is increasing. 24",

It would be a theft only if that individual had stolen the container for transport purposes. Some experts advocate an end to this extraordinary anomaly 2 when such great value is placed on organs by would-be recipients and the professionals obligated to find them.

The context of their whole lives is different from those of citizens of affluent countries. In such situations, although we still deplore kidney commerce for personal gain, it is impossible for us to condemn kidney donation for prearranged vending through a third party to raise money for an act of indirect altruism to a family member. For the donor in the personal no-gain setting of indirect altruism, the burden may be offset by the benefit to the family member, whereas the welfare of society is not at risk because of the underlying altruistic nature of the act, even though an organ has been obtained for money. Inherent in this support for indirect altruism in nonaffluent cultures is an insistence that the benefit to B, the intended beneficiary of this form of altruism, must be ensured. This ensurance necessitates a socially responsible, noncorruptible panel or tribunal of societal and professional peers to approve individual cases and set up a mechanism to collect money from the recipient purchaser and to effect the intended altruistic good of the donor.

But can they suffer?\" (2) \"What insuperable line prevents us from extending moral regard to animals?\" A modern utilitarian philosopher, Singer, has taken on the mantle of Bentham where animals are concerned. Pain is perceived essentially in the same way by all vertebrates, and it is not controversial that vertebrates used in experiments feel pain. There is a growing consensus, however, that animals can suffer, not just feel pain. Suffering implies self-awareness, and many experimenters are not ready to concede this point because it then implies a degree of intelligence and worth that would allocate rights to animals. 99 Regan 85 and others have argued that animals do have many rights, even if these are of a lesser magnitude than those of humans.

We have looked at this issue 31 and concluded that it would not be a barrier to xenotransplantation, based on the theological argument that need and necessity can allow that which is forbidden, and in any case, the prohibition is to eating only. There is a minority opinion, however, that pigs, partly because they are ritually unclean, cannot be used as source animals. From the religious perspective, it would be important that a xenotransplant should not tamper with the human personality, its freedom and its ability and eligibility to bear responsibility. Humans have stewardship responsibilities accepted noncontroversially by almost everyone, making it necessary to reduce the pain and suffering of animals being used for human purposes. 31, 55 The psychosocial aspects of humans adapting to xenotransplanted organs are unclear. Some recipients may experience emotional difficulties or have problems integrating the transplant in their self-image. 4 Although xenotransplantation eventually may eliminate the wait for an organ, it may give rise to other challenges, such as seeing animals as an infinite resource.

The major issue in xenotransplantation today is whether we are ready to proceed to systematic clinical trials. Our understanding today is that consent for experimental procedures should be informed, unhurried, and voluntary. Informed consent exists for the purpose of protecting the subject from the risks of the experiment. Normally, taking into account societal considerations might prejudice the interests of the individual subject. Generally, consent has nothing to do with protection of contacts or of society. It requires that the subject be made aware of the risks involved, the potential benefits to the subject, and all the alternatives available.",

Zoonotic infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), parvoviruses, and the SARS coronavirus have spread around the world, prompting calls for global international surveillance of xenotransplantation-associated diseases. 33 Trials cannot proceed ethically until there is agreement from society as a whole that it is willing to accept this risk. There are no easy and reliable ways of obtaining such a societal consent. It is a major ethical problem that initially can be addressed only by making every effort to inform and involve all segments of society, using every media outlet. Public policy decisions based on a riskbenefit analysis would likely favor individual patients, rather than the public at large. The \"precautionary principle\" may place priority on society as a whole. 22 This principle, as formulated in the Wingspread Declaration, states: \"When an activity raises threats to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken, even if some causeand-effect relationships are not established scientifically.\" 33 In xenotransplantation clinical trials, particularly for the early patients, many of the normal elements of individual consent would need to be compromised. Subjects would probably be very sick, and voluntariness would be questionable because, especially in the case of liver and heart subjects, the alternative may be death. The risks of rejection and the potential benefit can be estimated vaguely, but the risk from xenozoonoses cannot, because clinicians do not know which viruses would be more pathogenic in humans or would mutate or recombine in the host. Clinicians would not know if the source animal has any viruses about which nothing is known. The incubation period and latency of some retroviral infections (e.g., HIV) could be several years. There is considerable evidence that HIV jumped species from nonhuman primates to humans.",

Studies suggest it may be possible to produce pigs for xenotransplantation that pose a greatly reduced risk of infection. 7, 96, 117 The main foreseeable problem with clinical trials in xenotransplantation is with the question of postoperative monitoring. The recipient would have to agree to the requirement for strict monitoring, which may be intrusive and may result in quarantine, containment, or other physical restrictions if the recipient develops infections likely to endanger contacts, health care workers, or the public. Privacy and confidentiality almost certainly would have to be signed away in this consent procedure, especially because the contacts also would require monitoring. The recipient may be restricted from having sexual relations for perhaps 1 year or more. Contacts themselves would have to consent to postoperative monitoring, which may be intrusive in the case of a major infection difficult to diagnose or treat. There is an implicit need for community consent-not an easy thing to obtain because it normally would require public hearings, advisory bodies, and legislative and executive branch processes. 54 The fact that the patient is going to be required to comply with postoperative monitoring alters the nature of consent to something more aggressively binding and contractual. There is another normal feature of consent-the subject has the right to withdraw at any time from the experiment. This right would have to be transgressed because the recipient could not opt to withdraw later from the experimental procedure, which must conform to standards such as the Declaration of Helsinki. It would be extremely difficult, for example, for the recipient of a pig heart to withdraw from a study and have the organ removed 20 ; another example is when the participant harbors an infection that might jeopardize public health. The consent would need to be enforceable in a direction different from that in the past-this time against the best interests of the subject and in favor of the public. This situation would be a travesty of the concept of consent as it is known today. A type of \"Ulysses Contract\" could be used to compel the investigation, treatment, or confinement of a xenotransplant recipient, even in the event of rejection of the graft. 22",

An example was the case of Baruah, 73 a physician who was arrested in Assam, India, early in 1997 for violation of the Organ Transplantation Act. He had claimed to have transplanted successfully the heart, lungs, and kidneys of a pig into a human recipient at his own hospital, assisted by local colleagues and apparently by a colleague from Hong Kong. The patient died a week later, and the family, feeling suspicious, lodged a complaint with the police. This kind of activity might pose dangers because in the near future clinicians from scientifically advanced countries may start collaborating with colleagues in countries where the regulations may be more permissive. It would be better to consider seriously an international effort to draw up universal guidelines, while hastening to lay the groundwork for national regulatory mechanisms for clinical trials.",
