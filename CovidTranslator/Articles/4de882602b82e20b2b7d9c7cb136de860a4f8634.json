In this study, we isolated two single-stranded RNA aptamers specific to NS1 with K d values of 1.62 \u00b1 0.30 nM and 1.97 \u00b1 0.27 nM, respectively, using a systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure. The selected aptamers were able to inhibit the interaction of NS1 with tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25), and suppression of NS1 enabled retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) to be ubiquitinated regularly by TRIM25. Additional luciferase reporter assay and quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) experiments demonstrated that suppression of NS1 by the selected aptamers induced IFN production. It is noted that viral replication was also inhibited through IFN induction in the presence of the selected aptamers. These results suggest that the isolated aptamers are strongly expected to be new therapeutic agents against influenza infection.

            "text": "To prevent the amplification of influenza, the host cells initiate innate immune response by recognizing conserved motif or pathogen-associated molecule patterns of incoming pathogen. This innate immunity is accomplished by pattern-recognition receptors such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) (Kaisho and Akira, 2006) or retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) of the host cells (Yoneyama and Fujita, 2004) , followed by production of antiviral cytokine interferons (IFNs). To evade host's innate immune response, influenza has evolved a few strategies for viral replication. Influenza NS1 is known to be one of the most important proteins to counteract the antiviral IFN production of the host. NS1 is encoded by segment 8 of the influenza and range in size 217-237 amino acids. NS1 is comprised of two functional domains, N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) and C-terminal effector domain (ED). RBD, amino acids 1-73 of NS1, forms a six-helical homodimer, and its major role is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding, thereby blocking IFN induction on infection (Pichlmair et al., 2006) . ED also dimerizes and binds several cellular proteins (Aramini et al., 2011; Hale et al., 2008) , which is responsible for sequence variations of different virus strains. In fact, NS1 has multiple functions in infected cells. Of the various functions, the major role of NS1 is the disruption of host cell innate immune system, and inhibits the induction of IFN (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998; Kochs et al., 2007) . Thus far, there have been many attempts to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which NS1 suppresses the IFN production. One explanation of the NS1 function is sequestration of viral RNA, which leads to inhibition of main viral RNA sensor RIG-I in the host cell (Chien et al., 2004) . Strain-specific direct interaction between NS1 and RIG-I was also suggested. Jureka et al. (2015) demonstrated that RBD of 1918 H1N1 NS1 interacted directly with second caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of RIG-I, but no interaction was observed in case of Udorn H3N2 strain. In addition to direct interaction, NS1 has been shown to inhibit tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25)-mediated RIG-I ubiquitination, which suppresses the RIG-I signaling pathway (Gack et al., 2009) . Regarding the RIG-I ubiquitination, two kinds of mechanism were suggested. After recognition of viral RNA harboring 5\u2032-triphosphate by RIG-I, CARD is activated by either TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination (Gack et al., 2008) or binding of polyubiquitin chains that are previously synthesized by TRIM25 (Zeng et al., 2010) . However, it is not clear how NS1 antagonizes IFN induction exactly at present. Because of the important role of NS1 during viral infection, many attempts have been made to develop antiviral therapeutics targeting NS1. This involves antiviral compounds (Engel, 2013) , antisense oligonucleotides (Wu et al., 2014) , nucleic acid aptamers (Woo et al., 2013) , and so on.",

Unbound RNAs were reacted with the 2 \u03bcg GST-NS1 for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with 100 \u03bcl Glutathione-Sepharose 4B for 30 min. NS1 complexed with RNA was dissociated from the Glutathione-Sepharose 4B by elution buffer (binding buffer + 10 mM glutathione). RNAs bound to NS1 was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and purified by ethanol precipitation. cDNA was synthesized from recovered RNAs by reverse-transcription and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Total 15 rounds of selection were performed and the resulting DNA was cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, USA).

The GFP relative unit decreased in a hyperbolic manner with increasing amount of aptamers providing a 50% inhibitory concentration of 48.20 \u00b1 6.47 ng/ml (R-1, equivalent to 1.66 \u00b1 0.22 nM) and 55.07 \u00b1 4.36 ng/ml (R-2, equivalent to 1.90 \u00b1 0.15 nM), respectively. However, we were not able to detect any Fig. 4. IFN-\u03b2 induction by inhibition of NS1. (A) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding the NF-\u03baB luciferase reporter construct, Renilla luciferase, NS1, and increasing amounts (0, 100, 200, and 400 ng) of aptamers. The value was calculated as the ratio between the NF-\u03baB luciferase and the Renilla luciferase, corrected by naive and represented as a ratio at the y-axis. (B) HEK293T cells were transfected with NS1 and increasing amounts (0, 100, 200, 400, and 800 ng) of aptamers. Total mRNA was isolated, and the production of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA was quantitated by real-time PCR. The measured Ct value by real-time PCR was converted to the amount of IFN-\u03b2 relative to \u03b2-actin by the delta-delta Ct model equation, which is expressed on the y-axis as a ratio to the na\u00efve. The data represents average values after 3 independent experiments. Na\u00efve, HEK293T cells only; MOCK, cells transfected with only NS1.

            "text": "To cope with invasion of incoming pathogens, host cells have a self-defense system, innate immune response, such as TLRs or RIG-I like receptors. One of the primary roles in innate immunity is induction of IFN, antiviral cytokine of the host cells. Most of viruses have evolved strategies to circumvent the host's innate immune response by inhibition of IFN production. Influenza also has such an IFN blocking system, NS1, which is able to antagonize IFN induction by preventing IRF-3 and NF-\u0138B from activation. Therefore, NS1 is regarded as a good target for development of therapeutic agents such as small organic compounds and nucleic acids (Basu et al., 2009; Woo et al., 2013) . Regarding the molecular mechanism how NS1 suppresses the IFN production, as of yet, precise mechanism remains unclear even though many attempts have been made. However, of the suggested mechanisms relevant to RIG-I pathway, it is most likely that NS1 interferes with RIG-I signaling pathway by inhibiting the RIG-I ubiquitination by E3 ligase TRIM25 (Gack et al., 2008; Zeng et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "In this study, we isolated two RNA aptamers that specifically bind to and inhibit the function of NS1. One hundred nine bases ssRNA pool containing 40 random sequences in the central region was constructed by in vitro transcription using DNA library. When we analyzed binding affinities of the selected aptamers, about 1 nM K d values were obtained. In addition, both aptamers showed 90% sequence identity each other. In fact, we performed similar experiments to select the ssDNA aptamers specific to NS1 and reported pre-viously (Woo et al., 2013) . When we compared the binding affinities of RNA aptamers with DNA aptamer (18.91 \u00b1 3.95 nM in case of ssDNA aptamer), RNA aptamers showed almost ten times higher K d value, indicating that RNA aptamer is better binding agent than DNA aptamer. This is consistent with the fact that RNA can accommodate more variable structures than DNA. When the two selected RNA aptamers were analyzed structurally using Mfold, the central 40 random sequences were shown to form a stem-loop-stem with a small hairpin. Because three-dimensional information is not available at present, further investigation will be necessary to determine exactly how the stem-loop-stem structure plays a role in NS1 binding. Determination of the binding region of the selected RNA aptamers to NS1 showed similar binding pattern with the case of ssDNA aptamer ( Supplementary  Fig. S1 ), which was published previously (Woo et al., 2013) . RBD, not ED, of NS1 is the region to which the selected RNA aptamers were bound, and R38 amino acid is necessary for RNA aptamer binding. The reason why ssRNA and ssDNA aptamers showed similar binding to NS1 is not clear at present. According to the prediction of secondary structure by Mfold, the two kinds of nucleic acid aptamers do not show structural resemblance, although both of them inhibit the function of NS1. Thus far, crystal structure of each domain of NS1, RBD and ED, has been determined (Bornholdt and Prasad, 2006; Liu et al., 1997) . However, considering the three-dimensional structure of full-length wild type NS1 is not available as of yet, further investigation will be necessary to understand the protein structure-aptamer binding relationship.",

NS1 is a multifunctional protein and known to interact with more than 50 proteins (Marc, 2014) . Of many protein partners of the NS1, TRIM25 is involved in RIG-I signaling pathway, and sequestration of TRIM25 by NS1 leads to block the activation of RIG-I CARD. Although interaction mode is not clear in the present study, the selected aptamers were able to successfully inhibit the interaction of NS1 with TRIM25. This implies that the aptamers is effective in protecting the TRIM25 from NS1, thereby promoting the induction of IFN. We further investigated the effect of the selected aptamers on the RIG-I ubiquitination, which is necessary for RIG-I CARD to bind to a downstream protein partner, MAVS, of mitochondria . It has been shown that NS1 blocks the RIG-I signaling pathway by inhibiting the TRIM25-mediated RIG-I CARD ubiquitination, which leads to suppression of IFN induction (Gack et al., 2009) . Our results revealed that the selected aptamers specifically bind to and block the function of NS1, thereby recovering the regular function of TRIM25 and subsequent RIG-I ubiquitination (Fig. 3) . Therefore, this is consistent with the result of previous report (Gack et al., 2009) . After verification of successful introduction of the selected aptamers into HEK293T cells by confocal images (Supplementary Fig. S2 ) and FACS analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ), further investigations also showed that the selected aptamers can induce IFN (Fig. 4) and subsequent block the viral replication (Fig. 5) . Our results indicate that a blocking the NS1 function is one of the most",
