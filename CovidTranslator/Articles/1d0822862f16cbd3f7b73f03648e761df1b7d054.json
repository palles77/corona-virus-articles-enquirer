Herein, we analyzed the remaining 3.8 kb 3 end of the genome, which includes Gene 3, Gene 4, Gene 5, Gene 6, and the 3 non-coding region of the DE072 and D1466 strains. Those two viruses had high nucleotide similarity in Gene 4. However, the other individual genes had a much different level of sequence similarity with the same gene of the other IBV strains. The genome of five IBV strains, of which the complete sequence of the 3 end of the genome has been determined, were divided at an intergenic (IG) consensus sequence (CTGAACAA or CTTAACAA) and compared phylogenetically. Phylogenetic trees of different topology indicated that the consensus IG sequences and the highly conserved sequence around this regions may serve as recombination 'hot spots'. Phylogenetic analysis of selected regions of the genome of the DE072 serotype field isolates further support those results and indicate that isolates within the same serotype may have different amounts of nucleotide sequence similarity with each other in individual genes other than the S gene. Presumably this occurs because the consensus IG sequence serves as the template switching site for the viral encoded polymerase.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus causes a highly contagious upper-respiratory disease in chickens. The disease is characterized by increased ocular and nasal secretions, excess mucus in the trachea, decreased weight gain and feed efficiency in broilers, and declines in egg production and egg quality in layers. Although live attenuated vaccines are available, IBV continues to be a severe economic problem in commercial chickens because many different serotypes of the virus exist and do not cross protect [3] . [4] . Members of the Nidovirales order have a single stranded positive sense RNA genome and produce a 3 nested set of subgenomic mRNAs when they replicate [4] . Coronaviruses are divided into three antigenic groups based primarily on their structural proteins. Infectious bronchitis virus is the type strain of coronaviruses and is the only virus placed in antigenic group three. Characteristics of this group are a cleaved spike (S) glycoprotein, an N-glycosylated membrane (M) protein, and no hemagglutinin/esterase protein [19] . The genome of IBV is approximately 27 kilobases in length [1] . It is organized into six regions, each containing one or more open reading frames (ORF's), which are separated by intergenic sequences (IG) that contain the signal for transcription of subgenomic mRNAs [1, 17] . The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is encoded in the 5 two thirds of the viral genome by two overlapping open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) [1] . The structural protein genes are located 3 to the viral polymerase gene and are in order from 5 to 3 , the S glycoprotein gene (gene 2), the small envelope (E) gene (gene3), the M glycoprotein gene (gene4), and the nucleocapsid (N) gene (gene6) [19, 20] .",

More than twenty serotypes within IBV have been recognized worldwide and are thought to be generated by insertions, deletions, point mutations and RNA recombination [2, 3, 6, 14] . Evidence of natural recombination for several IBV strains has been reported [10, 15, 22] . However, because of the limited sequence information, recombination has only been described for a small part of the genome. So far, the complete sequence of the 3 end of the genome (from the 3 end of the polymerase gene to the poly A tail) of only three strains, Beaudette, KB8523 and CU-T2 have been determined [1, 11, 20] .",

We conducted phylogenetic analysis by dividing the genome in the IG sequence to elucidate possible role of this sequence in the homologous recombination in IBV.

            "text": "DE072 is a recent isolate made in 1992 [6] . In a previous study of the S gene, we demonstrated that this virus was closely related to D1466 which is an IBV vaccine strain of the D212 serotype from the Netherlands [7, 13, 18] . Analysis of gene 4 also reveals a high sequence relatedness between DE072 and D1466 (Table 3) . However, in the other genes analyzed in this study, DE072 shares high sequence similarity with the CU-T2 strain which has also been reported to be a recombinant between Arkansas and Massachusetts strains [10] . Considering the fact that both strains were isolated in the northeastern USA, it is possible that they had undergone similar selection pressure. On the other hand, D1466 shows high similarity with Beaudette and Holl52 strains in genes other than the S gene. The percent similarity in the N gene and a 15 base insertion in the 3 non-coding region suggests that both D1466 and Holl52 are closely related (Table 3 , Fig. 1 ). The Holl52 strain has been extensively used as a live vaccine in Europe [5] . This finding provides more convincing evidene that vaccine strains are contributing to the emergence of variants in the field. Based on these results, we suggest that DE072 and D1466 had the same origin, but diverged a long time ago and evolved independently in different geographical locations. Since recombination in coronaviruses is thought to occur by a template switching mechanism [8, 19] , we speculate that IG sequences may serve as 'hot spots' for homologous recombination. So far, recombinations suggested in IBV have been used on a small part of the genome [10, 15, 22] . Examining only a small part of the genome may result in misleading conclusions because of point mutations or conserved regions of the gene. We conducted phylogenetic analysis by dividing 3.8 kb of the 3 end of the genome among five IBV strains at the IG sequences. Phylogenetic trees of this sequence data had very different topology (Fig. 2) , which indicates that recombination had occurred. It has been reported that RNA recombination in IBV can occur randomly in non-localized sites in vitro [12] . However, considering the selection pressure in vivo recombination in the IG sequences should be advantageous to virus in two aspects. First, since crossovers occur at the site of consensus IG sequences, there would be no shift in the codon reading frame. Second, since whole genes are substituted, there would be no drastic change in the conformation of proteins encoded by individual genes. Further, cross-overs at each of the five IG sequences would generate tremendous genetic diversity. This amount of diversity may contribute to persistence and to the continuing emergence of new variants of IBV despite vaccination efforts.",
