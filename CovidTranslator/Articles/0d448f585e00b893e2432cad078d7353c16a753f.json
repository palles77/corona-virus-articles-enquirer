Resources must be organized before an event such that they are optimally used to treat as many victims as possible, as well as to avoid overwhelming available resources. Hirshberg and colleagues [1] in 2001 defined two different scenarios based on this supply-demand relationship. By their definitions, the absolute numbers of victims are less relevant than how demands reconcile with the capacity of the receiving facility. Multiple casualty incidents (MCIs) are defined as a large number of casualties generated over a short period that are appropriately managed with existing or extended resources. Mass casualty events (MCEs) in contrast, are major medical disasters that erode organized community support mechanisms and result in casualties which overwhelm resources.",

Among the 112 initial survivors, there were 7 additional deaths, all among the 19 critically injured. Frykberg realized that the overall mortality of survivors (7/112 or 6.3%) did not tell the whole story. He concluded that a better gauge of the medical response in a disaster would be the ''critical mortality,'' or those deaths occurring among the critically injured as a proportion of all critically injured. Because all 7 late deaths in the Beirut bombing occurred among those with an ISS greater than or equal to 15, the critical mortality was 7/19 or 37%, a statistic undiluted by the majority of survivors who did not have significant injury.

The explanation for this relationship is twofold. First, sorting through numerous victims to find the few critically injured takes valuable time. Second, an excess of patients who have minor injuries or no injuries prevents the DCA from functioning optimally. Predictably, radiology becomes a bottleneck; laboratory results are lost or delayed, phone lines are overloaded, medications are not properly dispensed, charts are incomplete, and staff become stressed and tired. Consequently, although individuals working in the DCAs may be under the impression that they are providing appropriate care, all of these seemingly inconsequential inadequacies conspire to increase the mortality of those patients whose lives hang in the balance and require immediate, uncompromised definitive care for survival.",

An early and clearly relevant use of the term ''surge capacity'' with regard to terrorist-related disaster threat was introduced by Smithson and Levy [16] in 2000. These authors reported that several cities ''plan to establish a surge capacity at the hospitals, as well as medical outposts away from them.'' The idea of medical outposts referred to the creation of overflow capacity for temporarily managing excessive numbers of non-critically injured or ill victims at buildings other than the hospital, such as field centers, large indoor arenas, stadiums, schools, mobile field care centers, and so forth [16] . Rational and appropriate management of such noncritical casualties is an integral component to instituting surge capacity at any level; excessive casualties inappropriately triaged will have a powerful adverse effect on critical mortality outcomes.",

Thus, prehospital protocols are designed to encourage a degree of overtriage. The intent is to capture all serious injuries while minimizing the opposite result of undertriage and having seriously injured trauma patients inappropriately treated at nontrauma centers. Frykberg recognized that in disaster scenarios the dead may vastly outnumber the injured, and only a minority of those injured are critical (10%-15%), so overtriage above and beyond the 50% mark was possible, with potentially deleterious consequences to the survival of the critically injured.",

As one follows the path of the victim from the scene, to field evacuation, to a casualty collection area, to transportation to a medical facility, through the diagnostic areas, and finally to transfer to a DCA, an ongoing process called triage takes place. The etymology derives from the French ''to sort.'' The decisions surrounding sorting, however, are highly situational. Initial sorting of patients attempts to identify their injury or illness and route them to appropriate care. In addition, when resources are inadequate to meet needs, triage performs a second function: rationing. Rationing is the process by which scarce resources are distributed, ideally in a prioritized manner to the most needy. Rationing is a charged topic for health care in the United States, but it is a long-recognized function of triage; however, rationing is seldom employed, because resources are rarely unavailable. Rationing decisions may occur at each of multiple points between the scene and the DCA: evacuation, first aid, transport, decontamination, admission, transfer, and treatment. If resources at each step are adequate, no rationing takes place; however, in a disaster, the closer one is to the scene when evaluating resources relative to needs, the more likely that rationing must take place.",

Green tags signify ambulatory patients who have minor injuries.

All affected victims must be observed and re-evaluated, because their condition may deteriorate.

In contrast, overflow resources are equipment, locations, and personnel that can be used in the treatment of additional patients, but which compromise the standard of care.

For instance, managing a critically ill patient in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) (a surge resource) with a 1:4 nursing care ratio (overflow strategy) would be considered as using the hospital's DCA overflow capacity.",

These overflow resources are acceptable and appropriate to treat the large numbers of noncritical victims of any disaster and may be necessary even for critical victims in extreme circumstances.

Once the system identifies patients as critical and delivers them to a DCA, triage ceases to function as routing; ORs and ICUs are the best of what medicine has to offer. In a DCA, rationing is employed only as a last resort. It may be appropriate to offer less than optimal care to green tagged victims; they can be triaged to a cafeteria or gymnasium for observation and delayed treatment.

Once normal resources are identified, participants identify surge and overflow resources. At each level of care (normal, surge, overflow), the care-limiting resource is identified. Participants then explore ways to expand that specific resource. The process continues by analyzing the subsequently exposed care-limiting resources. Then the exercise is repeated, assessing the next most likely scenario, and so on. When this process is completed, the group will have generated an inventory of all normal, surge, and overflow resources needed to provide each level of care in the ORs and ICUs.

With these measures, nurse staffing is our surge capacity-limiting resource. In fact, this is often our normal capacity-limiting resource. We have the physical capacity, equipment, and medical staff to care simultaneously for 96 critically ill patients with up to two thirds of these patients ventilated. Our nursing department estimates capacity to care for only a maximum of about 50 patients with a 2:1 ICU staffing ratio. Consequently, our surge capacity expansion efforts have endeavored to increase nurse staffing. We enter the overflow capacity phase (substandard alternatives) for each of these resources as they are consumed. Table 5 describes our response for  each resource. Bag-valve-mask resuscitators would substitute for ventilators; supplemental oxygen would be abandoned for room air; and patients would be located wherever there was space. Housestaff work hour regulations would be violated and the nurse/staffing ratio exceeded. In our overflow capacity scenario, it is the number of actual beds that limits our capacity. Using these resources, we estimate being able to care for about 200 critical patients for at most 48 hours, at which time outside relief would be required.
