Following a proposal by the commission, the HSC agreed on December 17, 2001, on a program for cooperation on preparedness and response to biologic and chemical agent attacks (or Health Security Programme). The program comprises 25 actions grouped under four objectives (available from: URL: http://europa.eu.int/comm/health/ph_threats/Bioterrorisme/bioterrorisme_en.htm). The overall goal is to improve cooperation between the member states with the aid of the commission and to facilitate collaboration between the different national authorities involved in public health preparedness for bioterrorism. During this process, gaps in resources and methods are identified and projects initiated to fill these gaps. As is standard practice in many sectors of activity at EU level, existing examples of preparedness in the member states are shared and can be extended or adapted for use throughout the EU. Projects and activities under the health security program are funded through existing funds, especially from the budget foreseen for the EU's public health programs. Other funds such as from the sixth framework program for research could also be used for activities of relevance to the health security program.",

Certain modifications to these systems, such as the addition of certain diseases considered as having a high potential for deliberate release, would have to be done to make the systems better adapted to the new challenges of bioterrorism. To achieve this, the Community Network on Communicable Diseases (the already existing mechanism for EU collaboration in the areas of infectious disease surveillance and control) extended its list of diseases to be reported, to include additional threats such as tularemia, anthrax, Q fever, and smallpox.",

Against this background, an approach more suitable to the demands for focused action in Europe was developed though a matrix model designed to provide an evaluation of the public health impact of any given agent that could be used in bioterrorism. The matrix model may also be used to identify areas where the public health response needed strengthening for any given agent. This means that for a given type of action a different set of agents would emerge as deserving the highest attention. The matrix model is currently being validated and has produced lists targeting specific areas of public health preparedness, which are currently being reviewed by members of the HSC. Using this model, identifying the public health impact of new threats should be possible, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (once it has been better characterized), multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, or any other new or drastically changed disease-causing agent.",

As a long-term goal these capabilities would be made available to all member states of the EU. Additionally, more concrete collaboration between laboratories was initiated to share techniques and participate in common quality assurance schemes. Assisted by the task force, the P4 (U.S. BSL-4) laboratories in the EU are currently forming a network that will enhance their research activities through common projects. They have been asked to develop procedures to make P4 diagnostics available to all member states and to handle, under high safety level requirements, a substantial workload of analysis of environmental samples that might arise following a series of bioterrorist incidents or threats.",

Currently a group of European modelers has been called by the task force to work together in a network to develop models for EU purposes.

However, this deadline likely does not provide enough time to complete the activities anticipated in many of the areas included in the 25-point action program. An extension of the task force's duration is therefore being sought. In the areas where activities have taken place, a centrally launched initiative at EU level has been found to be beneficial both for the member states and for the EU as a whole. The work has opened new communication channels between member states, improving both the understanding of the preparedness in other countries as well as giving the possibility to learn from good practice and tried solutions. The EC has also gained experience in working with a group of experts who initiate activities with more operational effectiveness than has been the case in the past. This experience will be very useful in the continued discussion on the development of a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control since the task force can be seen as a precursor to this centre, albeit in a narrow area of activity. During the remaining 6 months and the period of extension, if it is approved, the work in the area of bioterrorism will continue to strengthen the capabilities at EU level to respond to biologic and chemical threats. The capabilities to manage diseases in emergency situations in general will be improved, and knowledge gained will be most useful for other areas of emergency preparedness.",
