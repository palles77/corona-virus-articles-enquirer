PCR or RT-PCR was used to screen for the presence of 10 respiratory viruses. Viral agents were identified in 73.92% (601/813) of specimens, including RSV in 40.71%, hMPV in 6.15%, IFVA in 7.13%, IFVB in 0.98%, PIV1-3 in 7.87%, HCoV-HKU1 in 2.21%, HCoV-NL63 in 3.81%, HRV in 19.93%, AdV in 7.50% and HBoV in 11.56%. Two or more viruses were detected in 34.44% (280/813) of cases. The newly identified respiratory viruses, HBoV, hMPV, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63, accounted for 22.01% of the detected viral pathogens. RSV and HRV were frequently detected in patients with bronchiolitis, and hMPV was frequently associated with pneumonia. HCoV-NL63 was found to be one of the causative agents of acute respiratory wheezing in young children. No seasonal variation was found in the incidence of detection of HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 or HBoV. This 3-year study demonstrated that viral pathogens play an important role in children with ALRTIs, and more attention should be paid to these newly identified viral agents.",

            "text": "Acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRTIs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide, with the greatest number of deaths occurring in developing countries [1] . In China, pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children under 5 years old (>30 000 per annum [2] ). Viruses account for 30-90% of ALRTIs in young children [3, 4] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV1-3) and influenza viruses A (IFVA) and B (IFVB) are the most common viral agents responsible, being detected in 63.1% of Chinese children hospitalized with acute respiratory infections [5] . However, many new respiratory viruses have recently been identified as causative agents of lower respiratory illnesses in children (e.g. human coronaviruses (HCoV)-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV)) [6] [7] [8] . Moreover, rhinovirus (HRV), which has generally been considered a cause of mild upper respiratory illnesses in children and adults, is now considered to be a major cause of ALRTIs and asthmatic exacerbations [9, 10] . However, these viral agents of ALRTIs are rarely investigated or reported in China. To further understand the epidemiology of ALRTIs in children, we conducted a 3-year viral aetiology study to assess the contribution of 10 respiratory viruses to childhood ALRTIs in Lanzhou City, China.",

            "text": "ALRTIs are one of the most common paediatric diseases; indeed, pneumonia is the main cause of death in children under 5 years of age in developing countries [15] . In China, 24.5-65.2% of hospitalized paediatric patients are admitted due to an ALRTI [16] . In this study, we evaluated the overall prevalence of 10 respiratory viruses identified by PCR or RT-PCR in children with ALRTIs from 2006 to 2009. Of the 813 samples collected, respiratory viruses were detected in 601 (73.92%), which is in agreement with other reports suggesting that 30-90% of ALRTs have a viral aetiology [3, 4, 17] . However, the rate of respiratory virus detection in our study was higher than in some other reports [5, 18] , which may have been due to differences in detection methods. Direct immunoflourescence and viral culture are the most often applied methods; in contrast, we used RT-PCR and PCR, which are highly sensitive [18] . Another possibility is attempted detection of different viruses. Ten respiratory viruses were included in this study, including the novel viruses HBoV, hMPV, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63. Note that seasonal differences in the rates of detection of respiratory viruses correlated with the occurrence of ALRTI epidemics (Fig. 1) . RSV was the most frequently detected respiratory virus in children with ALRTIs in our study (40.71% of the ALRTIs and 37.74% of total viral pathogens), in agreement with previous reports [19, 20] . HRV has generally been considered a cause of mild upper respiratory illnesses in children and adults. However, HRV was second only to RSV in this study and was detected in 19.93% of samples. This rate was similar to that reported by Juven et al. [21] . The annual incidence of hMPV-associated ALRTIs was relatively stable during the study period. This is not consistent with previous reports, which suggested that hMPV-associated ALRTIs vary annually [18, 22] . This suggests that hMPV may exhibit geographically variable circulation patterns. Detection rates of 0.7-8.8% for HCoV-NL63 and 1.6-6% for HCoV-HKU1 in children with acute respiratory tract infections have been reported [18, 23] . In this study, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 accounted for 5.66% of the total cases, which suggests that these viruses are important causes of ALRTIs in children in Lanzhou City. The co-infection rate in HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1-positive samples was 73.47% (36/ 49) in this study, which is in line with previous reports [23] . Since its discovery in 2005, HBoV has been frequently detected worldwide in NPAs, with incidences varying from 1.5% to 18.9% [24] [25] [26] . The present study showed a relatively high HBoV infection rate (11.56%) and a higher frequency of co-infection (79.8%, 75/94) than the other viral agents; RSV and HRV were most frequently detected in conjunction with HBoV. Given this high co-infection rate, the exact role of HBoV in ALRTIs needs to be investigated further [18, 27] . The newly identified respiratory viruses (HBoV, hMPV, HCoV-NL63 and, HKU1) accounted for 22.01% of the total in this study. Thus these data suggest that viral pathogens are important causes of ALRTIs in Lanzhou City and that the novel respiratory viruses play an important role in children with ALRTIs. The rate of mixed infection, 46.59% (280/601), was significantly higher than in other reports (8.6-11.5%) [17, 19] , suggesting marked geographical variation. As to whether the mixed infection compared with single infection with viruses may increase the severity of disease, there have been some conflicting data. In our study, due to limited clinical information, we can't reach a conclusion about this issue. Additional study is needed to better define the role of mixed infection in the severity of disease.",

            "text": "RSV, hMPV, PIV1-3 and HRV exhibited fixed seasonal epidemic patterns, but no seasonal variation was noted for AdV, which is in agreement with most previous reports [5, 18, 20] . Early reports suggested that epidemics of influenza occur in the winter months in temperate climates, whereas influenza may be seen year-round in the tropics. In our study, influenza occurred most frequently from November to April. However, influenza virus incidence did not peak in 2009, the time of the H1N1 pandemic, suggesting that the H1NI epidemic did not spread to Lanzhou City prior to November 2009. Previous reports suggested that HBoV infection occurred predominantly during the winter season or that it increased in spring and summer [18, 28] . In our study, HBoV was identified throughout each of the first 2 years of the study period, without any noticeable seasonal fluctuation. However, detection of this virus peaked (56% of total isolates) between December 2008 and April 2009, and then it was not detected again until November 2009. This suggests that HBoV may exhibit a geographically variable prevalence pattern. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have been in continuous circulation since they were first identified and cause numerous infections annually [23] . In our study, HCoV-HKU1 was detected mainly during winter and spring, with a peak in January 2008. However, HCoV-Nl63 did not exhibit any fixed seasonal rhythm; indeed this virus was not detected in 2008 and peaked during July and October 2009. HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E predominantly circulate during the winter and early spring with outbreaks occurring every 2-4 years [23] . Whether HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-Nl63 infections follow a similar prevalence pattern is not clear. Thus, further study, and particularly long-term surveillance, is needed to address these issues. Subjects 7-12 months of age showed the highest frequency of viral detection. However, no significant differences in infection rates in the six age groups for each viral pathogen were detected, the sole exception being RSV (Tables 2 and 3 ). RSV predominated in subjects <1 year of age. This differs from other reports [18] , which suggested that RSV predominated among younger infants, but that AdV, hMPV and IFVA were more frequently detected in children over 24 months of age. Viral ALRTIs have been suggested to occur more frequently in boys [17, 29] . In this study, although the male:female ratio of positive specimens was 1.8:1, this was not significant (p 0.375; chi-square test). Further investigation is needed to elucidate the precise effect of age and sex on the risk of viral infection in this patient group.",

HBoV was more frequently observed in those with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in this study, which suggests that HBoV is an important viral agent in children with ALRTIs, as reported elsewhere [8, 30] . HCoV-NL63 has been suggested to be a causative agent of acute respiratory wheezing in young children [23] . In this study, HCoV-NL63 patients also had a high frequency of wheezing (32.26%), which was not significantly different from that of RSV (35.95%). Our data suggested that hMPV was frequently associated with pneumonia, but other studies have suggested that hMPV is more often associated with bronchiolitis or wheezy bronchitis [6] . Furthermore, HRV is generally considered to be a common cause of mild upper respiratory illnesses in children. However, here, HRV was the most common viral pathogen in young patients with ALRTIs. More data are needed to address the exact clinical role of these newly identified respiratory viruses.",

This 3-year study demonstrated that at least threequarters of ALRTIs in children were associated with known viral pathogens. RSV and HRV were the two most common viruses detected. Novel viral agents, including HBoV, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and hMPV, accounted for a high proportion of ALRTIs. More attention should therefore be paid to these agents. Additional study is required to define the exact role and molecular and epidemiological characteristics of these newly identified viral agents in ALRTIs in different geographical regions.",
