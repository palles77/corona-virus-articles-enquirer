The ELISA detected IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV in all 74 convalescent-phase samples from SARS patients while weakly cross-reacting to only 1 of the 210 control sera from healthy donors. This finding thus led to a kit sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 100, 99.5, and 99.6%, respectively. The test thus provided a positive predictive value (PPV) of 98.7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100%. In addition, the ELISA gave a positive delta of 5.4 and a negative delta of 3.6, indicating an excellent differentiation between positives and negatives. The same recombinant proteins were also applied to a newly developed platform for the development of a 15-min rapid test. The resulting rapid test has an excellent agreement of 99.6%, with a kappa value of 1.00, with the ELISA. Again, this rapid test was able to detect 100% of the samples tested (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 42) while maintaining a specificity of 99.0% (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 210). The PPV and NPV for the rapid test thus reached 95.3 and 100%, respectively.",

This was promptly recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) when the SARS epidemic spread beyond its place of origin in Guangdong Province, China, and a global alert was declared for the first time in WHO history. The outbreaks affected over 8,098 people and spread to more than 29 countries and regions in a short period of 6 months, with a mortality rate of up to 15% (WHO summary report available at http: //www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2003_09_23/en).

Prompt identification and isolation of infected patients remain of paramount importance for disease control, since no drug or vaccine is available for this disease. With few options in the laboratory for detection, initial disease management relied on travel and contact history and presentation of symptoms. PCR tests developed with unprecedented speed are now available and can detect specific RNA of SARS-CoV, thus providing a laboratory method for diagnosis of SARS. WHO had, based on this method, revised its criteria for case definition. However, existing protocols for PCR were not without their limitations. The Singapore experiences showed that the positive predictive values (PPVs) provided by PCR varied from 56.7 to 83.8% when different clinical specimens were used (A. E. Ling, \"SARS-the Singapore laboratory experience,\" presented at the WHO Conference on SARS Research, Singapore, Republic of Singapore, 19 June 2003). In a very recent report (13) , the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) protocols of two WHO SARS network laboratories were evaluated, and the findings confirmed similar shortcomings of RT-PCR. Therefore, the existing PCR cannot rule out the presence of the SARS virus when a negative result is obtained; neither can it exclude the possibility of false detection due to laboratory contamination (9) . In the meantime, methods involving indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA), classic tissue culture for viral isolation, and electronic microscopy of the cell culture for diagnosis are either time-consuming or technically very demanding. Alternative approaches are therefore critical for efficient management of the disease.",

In addition, a rapid point-of-care test such as an immunochromatographic test can also facilitate case diagnosis and disease management in remote areas where laboratory facilities are not readily available. In this study, we were able to demonstrate the potential of two serological tests developed by utilizing two recombinant proteins: Gst-N and Gst-U274. As reported elsewhere, Gst-N was derived from the nucleocapsid region, whereas Gst-U274 was derived from a unique protein of SARS-CoV (12a). Our study results suggested that the two serological tests (each with an excellent sensitivity of 100%) could provide confirmatory information for the diagnosis of SARS, especially for suspected cases initially screened by PCR as negative.",

Protein Gst-N was derived from nucleocapsid of the SARS-CoV with a highly conserved motif (amino acids 111 to 118) found in all coronaviruses (12) deleted, whereas Gst-U274 was from a unique SARS-CoV protein. For this study, the Gst-U274 protein was further purified with a Superdex S-200 HR10/30 column on an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) system (Amersham). The buffer used contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, and 1 mM \u2424-mercaptoethanol; the flow rate was 0.5 ml/min; and fractions of 1 ml were collected.

Briefly, the 96-well polystyrene microtiter plates (Immuno 1B; Themo Labsystem, Franklin, Mass.) were coated with the protein mixtures at a volume of 100 l per well by incubation overnight (16 to 18 h) at room temperature. The plates were washed five times with PBS-Tween 80 (PBST), and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 200 l (per well) of a Tris-based diluent for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were further washed another five times before 10 l of serum in 200 l of Tris-based diluent (containing 1% each bovine serum albumin [BSA] and skim milk powder) was added. Subsequently, the plates were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by six washes with PBST. Horseradish peroxidaseconjugated goat anti-human immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:500 dilution) was added at 100 l per well, and this mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C.

            "text": "Recent studies have suggested the potential of a SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein as a diagnostic reagent for the detection of SARS (8, 12a) . However, the application of this protein in developing a viable diagnostic test remained to be fully demonstrated. The follow-up study presented here provides results to fill in the gap. The newly developed ELISA in this study utilizing the two Gst-N and Gst-U274 recombinant proteins was able to detect all 74 samples tested. This result thus has demonstrated the capability of the new test for the detection of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV using the convalescent-phase samples \u054616 days from the onset of the disease. In addition, the new test was found to be highly specific, with only 1 initial false positive out of the 210 control subject samples tested. Furthermore, the reactivity end points obtained with the ELISA suggested satisfactory sensitivity by a different parameter. Although the results were not obtained with identical samples from a previous preliminary study (Y. C. Wang, SARS Diagnostics: Scientific and Regulatory Challenges Workshop, 2003; U.S. Food and Drug Administration, http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/dockets/03n0281/03n0281 .htm), the range of dilutions from \u03fe1:40 to 1:640 for the reactivity end points is nevertheless a good indication of sensitivity comparable to if not better than those previously studied. All of these findings suggested that the ELISA be ready for application at (1). The same recombinant proteins of Gst-N and Gst-U274 used in ELISA were also applied to the rapid immunochromatographic test but were applied separately as two different testing markers. Intrinsically, the newly developed rapid immunochromatographic test could provide not only indications for case detection but also details of maybe clinical significance, should a correlation be established later. Although the biological function of the unique protein is yet to be unraveled, the Gst-U274 recombinant was found to be serologically reactive and unique to SARS-CoV (12a). In addition, the protein was found in some cases to give a higher reaction signal when tested for the IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV (12a). Because of this kind of finding, the usefulness of the protein should not be ruled out prematurely, even though the result obtained here with the rapid test indicated its limitation for case detection with the 42 convalescent-phase samples included in this study. Nevertheless, Gst-U274 alone detected a fair proportion (85%) of the patient samples tested, and further studies of the rapid test using acute-phase specimens might prove rewarding.",

However, the number was finally adjusted to 238 after reclassification with a serological test, the IFA. The confirmation of an additional 32 cases suggested the importance of serological tests and the necessity for retesting, especially for samples with results initially negative by PCR. However, although antibody to SARS-CoV can be detected in some cases during the acute phase of the disease (1), IgG antibody is believed to reach its peak value around 60 days after onset of obvious symptoms (9) . Therefore, even though they were found to be sensitive with the convalescent-phase sera tested, the utility of the serological tests developed here for earlier detection has yet to be established and may very well be limited. In this aspect, further development of the tests to include the capability to detect IgM antibody is warranted, because IgM antibody is believed to appear much earlier and reach its peak value around 14 days after the onset of the disease (9) .",
