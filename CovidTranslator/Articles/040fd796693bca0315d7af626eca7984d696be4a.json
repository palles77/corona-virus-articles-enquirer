            "text": "The use of a DNA immunization approach to deliver protective antigens against Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) has been successful in previously reported studies. In the current study, the gene designs for V and F1, two well-studied virulent factors serving as main targets for vaccine development, were altered to explore additional options in hopes of improving the protective immunity of DNA vaccines expressing these two antigens. Compared to the wild type V gene DNA vaccines, the use of codon optimized V gene sequences was effective in improving the antigen expression, titers of anti-V antibody responses, and survival against a mucosal lethal challenge. For the F1 DNA vaccine, removal of the N-terminal hydrophobic region was able to improve protective immunity. However, adding a mammalian signal peptide sequence to F1 actually led to reduced protection despite it inducing slightly higher anti-F1 antibody responses. The F1 gene can be fused with a gene coding for YscF, a newly confirmed partial protective antigen for Y. pestis, to produce DNA vaccines that express fused F1 and YscF antigens. One design, in particular, that had YscF fused to the downstream sequence of F1, produced better protection than separate F1 or YscF DNA vaccines, suggesting a potential synergistic effect between these two antigens. Findings from the above studies indicated that there are multiple approaches to optimize the protective immunity for plague DNA vaccines. Most importantly, proper antigen engineering to produce optimal antigen gene inserts in DNA vaccines can clearly play a major role in the future designs of a wide range of DNA vaccines.",

            "text": "Plague, caused by the bacterium, Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis), still remains a potential public health threat in many parts of the world and is also a serious concern as a potential bioterrorism agent. There are two main forms of plague: the bubonic plague, resulting from transmission of the bacteria via the bite of an infected flea, and the pneumonic plague, which is caused by the subsequent spread of the bacteria to the lungs. The pneumonic plague is also transmissible from person to person via airbone transmission and is almost 100% fatal when left untreated. Although vaccines are useful in the prevention of infection by Y. pestis and a number of killed whole-cell (KWC) vaccines and a live attenuated vaccine (EV76) have been developed over the years, various shortcomings and drawbacks have limited their wide use in the prevention of plague in humans [1] [2] [3] [4] . Two Y. pestis proteins, fraction 1 capsular protein (F1) and LcrV (V) protein, are known to be protective antigens. In the last decade, subunit vaccines based on F1 and V recombinant proteins have been shown to be immunogenic and protective in various animal studies against plague challenges [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Subunit vaccines comprising recombinant F1 and V proteins have shown to be immunogenic in a phase I clinical trial but the levels of protective antibody responses are not impressive and may not persist for an extended period [14] . The search for additional protective antigens has only achieved limited progress. A third protective antigen, YscF, was recently reported in several independent studies but the level of protection was only partial when tested in lethal challenge studies in animal models [15] [16] [17] .",

            "text": "Recently, DNA vaccination has emerged as a novel approach of immunization and is beginning to show promising signs of its utility in humans [18] [19] [20] [21] . Previous studies, including our own, have demonstrated that DNA vaccines expressing F1 or V antigens were able to elicit antigenspecific antibody responses and protected animals against lethal plague challenges via mucosal route [22] [23] [24] [25] . At the same time, experience accumulated in the studies of DNA vaccines against other pathogens has indicated that the efficacy of DNA vaccines can be further improved from its prototypic design in which the original gene sequence from a pathogen antigen is directly cloned into a DNA vaccine vector. Several well-established strategies including antigen engineering, signal peptide selection, and codon usage optimization can all affect the optimal expression of antigens encoded in DNA vaccines [17, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . One unique consideration for DNA vaccines that express bacterial antigens is codon usage. If DNA vaccines are developed for human applications, high level expression in mammalian cells is required. However, expression of proteins coded by bacterial genes in mammalian cells can be hampered as codon usage for bacterial genes may not be optimal for protein expression in mammalian cells. Previous studies have shown that codon optimization was effective in improving antigen expression and/or the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines against a wide range of viral pathogens such as Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) [26] [27] [28] , influenza [30] , and papillomavirus (HPV) [31] , and, in limited studies, against bacterial pathogens such as anthrax [32] and tetanus [33] .",

First, for the DNA vaccine expressing the V antigen, there is a previous report showing that a codon optimized V DNA vaccine was not more effective than the wild type V gene DNA vaccine in eliciting anti-V antibodies in mice; however, no attempts were made to determine whether this vaccine was able to increase levels of protection [22] . In the current study, we synthesized a new codon optimized DNA sequence coding for the Y. pestis V antigen with synonymous codon alternation based on the wild type lcrV gene sequences. Mouse studies were conducted to examine whether codon optimization can improve the ultimate protection even if there is no effect on the levels of antibody responses.",

Our previous study also demonstrated that adding a leader sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was able to improve the immunogenicity of an F1 DNA vaccine [25] . However, the other study showed that simple removal of the putative F1 leader sequence was more protective than a modified F1 insert using a signal-bearing E3 polypeptide of Semliki Forest Virus [24] . In order to reconcile this difference, we combined designs from the above two studies by using the leader of tPA in these studies.

The d-F1 gene, following removal of the natural signal peptide, was amplified with primer pairs F1-3/F1-2 or F1-5/F1-2 (Table 1) , respectively.

In order to determine whether there is any synergistic effect if a fusion protein containing both F1 and YscF antigen components is constructed, we designed two versions of DNA vaccines expressing both F1 and YscF antigens (Fig 6A) . Depending on whether the YscF antigen is fused to the N-or C-terminus of dF1 antigen, they are called YscF-F1 and F1-YscF, respectively. Both YscF-F1 and F1-YscF DNA vaccines were produced by cloning one of the two inserts into the DNA vaccine vector pJW4303 downstream of a tPA leader sequence. The expression of F1 and YscF components by these two fusing antigen DNA vaccines was examined in transiently transfected 293T cells, followed by Western blot analysis. Both fusion antigen DNA vaccines expressed their antigens very well when probed by an F1-specific rabbit serum (Fig 6B) . YscF-dF1 had higher overall protein expression and improved secretion of YscF-dF1 in the supernatant (Fig 6B) . Similarly, in a separate Western blot analysis, anti-YscF antibody was able to identify both fusion protein antigens but not dF1 antigen alone (data not shown).",

Based on the analysis of genes with coding sequence equal to or larger than 300 bps, the overall \"G+C\" content was 47.64% in the whole Y. pestis genome [37] . The synonymous codon usage pattern of these genes was different. Gene expression levels are strongly related to the frequency of \"G+C\" at the third position of synonymous codon usage [37] . Sequence analysis for the Y. pestis gene coding for V protein, lcrV, as part of the 70-kb low calcium response (lcr) plasmid, showed a \"G+C\" content of only 37.71%. Because codon usage is directly linked to preferred tRNA usage in a given cell type, it is conceivable that codon optimization for LcrV gene is important for its high level expression of this bacterial protein in mammalian cells [38] . However, in a previous report, codon optimization for the V gene based on murine codon preference did not make any difference in a DNA vaccine vector pVAX1-CMV-TE when it was tested in mice and the peak anti-V antibody titers were measured [22] . Results in the current study showed that codon optimization is very effective in not only eliciting higher antibody responses but also in improving protection when compared to the wild type V gene-based DNA vaccine.",

First, the exact levels of codon changes may be different, however, since no sequence information is available for the previous study, it is hard to compare the exact sequence difference between the two studies. In our study, we also made sure to minimize sequence changes that may generate inhibitory secondary RNA structures. It is not known whether a similar analysis was incorporated in the previous study. It is quite unusual that in the previous report that one group of mice immunized with the codon optimized V gene DNA vaccine had worse immune responses than the wild type V gene DNA vaccine. It appeared that some changes in the codon optimized V gene had a negative effect on the otherwise immunogenic wild type V gene. Second, the study approaches were different in these two reports. In the study conducted by Garmory et al., the comparison between the codon optimized and the wild type V DNA vaccines was done in mice using only intramuscular (im) immunization and mice required up to five im immunizations before any positive anti-V antibody titers could be detected [22] . However, in our previous [25] and current studies, strong positive anti-V IgG responses can be easily detected within two DNA immunizations delivered by a gene gun. It was shown recently that both the physical DNA delivery methods (gene gun or electroporation) were much more effective than the intramuscular needle injection method [39] . Because the overall antibody levels were so low in the previous report [22] , a protein boost had to be given in order to detect any difference between codon optimized and wild type V genes when they were used as a prime immunization, which may bring more variables to the final measurement. Finally, in the current study, the protection results from the challenge study provide more definitive evidence to support the survival benefit of codon optimized V DNA vaccine while the previous study did not test such a difference in challenge studies between the vaccine formulations with different codon usages.",

F1 is a 17.5 kDa protein which is considered an important but not essential virulence factor unique to Y. pestis. The reason for this is because the F1-negative mutant bacterial strains do not abolish virulence of Y. pestis but lead to a delay in onset of the disease in animal models [40, 41] . Recombinant F1 protein is very immunogenic as are F1 DNA vaccines [24, 25] . Our previous study also demonstrated the addition of the leader sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in front of the entire original coding sequence for F1 was able to improve the immunogenicity of F1 DNA vaccine [25] , but a study from another group showed that the removal of a putative F1 leader sequence from the F1 coding sequence was more protective than adding a signal-bearing E3 polypeptide of Semliki Forest Virus [24] . In order to reconcile such differences, we combined designs from the above two studies by using the leader of tPA in these studies.",

However, the protection results showed that the addition of a tPA leader led to lower protection when compared to counterparts without a tPA leader. This was the case between either the tPA-F1 and F1 pair or the tPA-dF1 and dF1 pair, i.e., removal or not of the putative F1 leader did not make the addition of a tPA leader more effective. This finding was further confirmed by the data that the protection levels for F1 (keeping the original putative leader) and tPA-dF1 (replacing the putative leader with a new tPA leader) were similar. The worst among the four F1 DNA vaccine designs was tPA-F1, which basically had two leaders (one from tPA plus the putative F1 leader). The most effective design was dF1, F1 without any N-terminal leader sequence. It is not clear why a \"leader-less\" F1 is more protective, given the finding that this design did not lead to the highest anti-F1 IgG responses. Future studies should analyze additional bacterial proteins to understand whether bacterial proteins have any unique sequences that may affect their expression in the mammalian system and, more importantly, their functional conformation in eliciting protective immune responses. This knowledge is important not only to DNA vaccines but also to recombinant protein-based bacterial vaccines, which only started to enter the vaccine development pipeline in recent years. DNA vaccine studies, as presented in the current report, can certainly be used as very valuable tools to any subunit-based vaccine studies.",

However, technically, a polyvalent subunit-based vaccine can be challenging because of the cost and technical complexity associated with the production of multiple protective vaccine components. In the past, a V-F1 fusion protein was proposed to minimize such issues associated with physically separate, bivalent V and F1 protein vaccines.

Two versions of fusion antigens were produced, either F1 upstream of YscF or YscF upstream of F1, and both were immunogenic as evidenced by their ability to generate similar levels of antigen-specific antibody responses. However, improved protection was observed only when the YscF was fused downstream of F1 protein (F1-YscF design) while the other fusion antigen design (YscF-F1) had reduced protection when the tPA-F1 DNA vaccine was used as the baseline control for the protection studies using both fusion antigens. In our previous study, we demonstrated that YscF in its dimer form, but not in the monomer form, was protective [17] . Therefore, we did not include a YscF monomer as the control in the current study. Even with the dimer form of YscF, the protection level was only partial (60% protection against intranasal challenge with 15 LD50 of Y. pestis).",

            "text": "It is also interesting to observe that the YscF-F1 design had much higher levels of secreted antigens than the F1-YscF1, but could not induce better protective immunity than the latter. When the F1 antigen alone was included, we found that it was most protective when it had no leader sequence and did not require high level of secretion, as examined by in vitro assays. Therefore, it may not be a total surprise that a mainly intracellularly expressed F1-YscF fusion protein is more protective than the easily secreted YscF-F1 fusion protein. However, this finding, along several other results presented in the current report, points to the importance of antigen engineering in the next phase of DNA vaccine research. In the past, given the genebased nature of DNA vaccines, optimization of the DNA vaccine vector and delivery of DNA vaccines have been the main focus of research being conducted. The findings that changes to the coding sequence itself can significantly affect not only the immunogenicity but also protection will bring more attention to the designs of antigen inserts which may affect a wide range of considerations, including antigen conformation, antigen expression, post-translational antigen modification, and ultimately the fate of antigen processing and presentation in vivo which remains largely unknown to DNA vaccines. Results reported here using Y. pestis proteins as model antigens should make antigen engineering the first step of the above complicated process as we previously noted [42] .
