The transmission control was improper and co-infections were common during the initial period of the outbreak in Wuhan. One recent study found a correlation between the higher CFR in Wuhan with the higher healthcare burden compared with other provinces in China 10 . It is unthinkable that sickening citizens, infected or not, and family members were confined in a city lockdown with an overwhelmed medical system and that they were forbidden from going to other provinces to seek for better care to save their lives. This also inevitably created logistical as well as psychological impact on healthcare workers operating in those harsh environments, described in a call for international assistance by Chinese medical workers, as \"nurses' mouths are covered in blisters and some nurses have fainted due to hypoglycaemia and hypoxia 11 . Sixty-three percent of the infected healthcare workers have been in Wuhan, including the 5 who died as a result of the infection 9 . However, the 0.3% CFR for the 1,688 medical workers (who were mainly aged less than 60 years as indicated in the report 8 ), may represent a proper estimation of the severity of COVID-19 in this age group in countries with universal access to quality medical services. Our study has a few limitations: There may be infected healthcare workers who still have not completed their natural progression of the disease with definite outcomes.

This report covers all the 72,314 COVID-19 cases and the 1,688 laboratory-confirmed cases among healthcare workers as of February 11. A similar version in English was also published in the Journal of American Medical Association(JAMA) 9 , including clinical outcomes, classified by severity (mild symptoms vs. severe/critical conditions) and by time into three 10-day periods based on the onset of symptoms reported by the patients. Using chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test, we analyze the changes in percentage of infected healthcare workers in severe conditions over the same three periods (the same three regions (Wuhan City, Hubei Province excluding Wuhan, China excluding Hubei). We also compare the CFR for all infected patients aged 20-59 and for healthcare workers.All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Severity and transmissibility of the COVID-19 have been the most important issues researchers and public health authorities have been urgently trying to tackle since the start of the outbreak. The first studies reporting single-center case series of hospitalized patients of COVID-19 showed high rates of admission to intensive care (32%), high mortality (15%)",
