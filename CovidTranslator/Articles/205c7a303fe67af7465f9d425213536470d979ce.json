The current production of animal protein for human consumption is projected to continue increasing until 2050 (Table 1) . To achieve these predicted increases it will be of crucial importance to improve feed conversion, production parameters, and genetic resistance to disease as well as control exposure to pathogens by improved biosecurity and vaccination.",

Viruses are inert outside of living cells and are strictly intracellular pathogens. Entrance into living cells is essential for their replication using cellular organelles for the production of viral proteins. Viruses have double-stranded (ds) or single-stranded (ss) deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) genomes but never both. Some of the larger viruses have genomes coding for proteins that are needed for genome replication (e.g., poxviruses and herpesviruses), whereas other viruses depend on cellular enzymes to replicate their genomes. The genome is surrounded by a capsid that consists of proteins or sometimes by a lipid membrane derived from the host cell, which is referred to as the envelope. Viral proteins are inserted in the envelope during the development of virus particles. Enveloped viruses are in general susceptible to inactivation by disinfectants and external factors, such as sunlight, whereas viruses with only a protein capsid are more resistant to chemical and physical treatments, which have important consequences for biosecurity measures.",

Individual bacteria range in size from 1 to 20 mm, but they can form clusters, chains, or biofilms. Bacterial genomes consist of a single ds DNA chromosome, which is often circular but can be linear. Bacteria reproduce by cell division. Small circular, autonomously replicating DNA sequences called plasmids may be present. These plasmids can contain virulence factors and sequences conferring antibiotic resistance. Plasmids can be exchanged between bacteria of the same or different species. Most bacteria have a rigid cell wall and may have flagella or fimbria. The composition of the cell wall is important for a broad classification into two groups: Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The only important pathogenic bacteria lacking a rigid cell wall are the Mycoplasmas, which have a plasma membrane. Some bacteria (e.g., Bacillus antracis causing antrax) produce endospores that are extremely resistant to chemical or physical treatments and can remain dormant for very long periods. The classification of bacteria was traditionally based on morphology, culturing on different media, motility, and metabolic activity, which all required the ability to grow the bacteria in inert media. With the advance of next generation sequencing, classification of bacteria can be achieved to the level of strain identification using the 53 genes coding for ribosomal protein subunits (ribosomal multilocus sequence typing (rMLST)) (Jolley et al., 2012) .",

A good introduction to the basics of veterinary immunology can be found in 'Veterinary Immunology: Principles and Practice' (Day and Schultz, 2011) ; more in-depth information is provided in 'The Immune System, third ed.' (Parham, 2009) . Both books are focused on the immunology of mammalian species. Readers interested in the immunology of birds or teleost fish may consult 'Avian Immunology, second ed.' or 'Fish Defenses, vol. 1: Immunology' (Zaccone et al., 2008) , respectively. Most of the information on mammalian immunology is based on studies in mice or humans, whereas avian immunology is largely based on studies in chickens. Within these two classes of animals, major differences may exist among species of the same class. Similarly, major differences are expected to exist among the approximately 4000 teleost fish species. Key differences between the three classes of animals and, if appropriate, within classes are indicated. Immune responses are often divided into innate and acquired (also called adaptive) immune responses, but this division is no longer seen as an absolute. Innate immune responses, although capable of directly killing microbes, are also absolutely required for the generation of adaptive immune responses. This is achieved by specific 'pattern recognition receptors (PRR)' that are located on the cellular membranes and in the cytoplasm of the cells. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are an example of PRR and were originally described in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster). PRRs recognize specific 'pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs).' PAMPs are conserved among classes of microbes but should not be confused with virulence factors. Binding of PAMPS through TLRs or other PRR on the so-called professional antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as dendritic cells and macrophages or infected cells, results in the production of specific cytokines or interleukins (ILs) by APC. The ILs activate lymphocytes starting the activation of the adaptive immune system.",

Pathogens first encounter physical and chemical barriers at the skin and epithelial surfaces in the respiratory and intestinal tracts. Mucus on the skin of fish as well as in the upper respiratory tracts acts as a chemical barrier, can trap pathogens, and prevent infection. If a pathogen successfully overcomes the physical barriers, it meets cells of the innate immune system that are equipped with secreted and cellassociated defense mechanisms. Soluble defenses induce inflammation and include interferons (IFN), defensins, and complements. Complement can promote phagocytosis by cells such as neutrophils (called heterophils in birds) and macrophages, which initiate cell-associated defenses, such as nitric oxide (NO) production. Natural killer (NK) cells exhibit both innate and adaptive-type responses. NK cells can kill tumor and virus-infected cells and are an important source of IFN-\u03b3, which also enhances macrophage and neutrophil phagocytosis and microbial killing. Most of these innate responses are very similar in teleost fish, birds, and mammals, although minor differences among these three groups may exist.",

The heavy chains have a number of constant domains and one variable domain, whereas the light chain has one constant and one variable domain. The variable domains of the heavy and light chains form the antigen-binding site, whereas the constant domains of the heavy chain are important for additional functions, such as activation of complement or binding to cellular receptors.

It is the dominant antibody in serum and depending on the immunization schedule and vaccine used it is the key antibody produced in vaccine-induced, antibody-based protective immunity. After a primary infection or first vaccination, IgG antibodies are detected approximately 7 days postinfection (pi), which is named the primary response. One of the hallmark characteristics of an acquired immune response is memory. Memory B cells are generated during the primary response, and on second exposure to the same antigen, they are responsible for a rapid increase of IgG antibody production.

These cells recognize small antigen fragments of 8-12 amino acid peptides if these fragments are presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins, which are expressed on the surface of virtually all cells in the body. When CTLs recognize a small peptide expressed in the context of MHC class I, they kill the cells presenting the antigen through a rather complex system, eliminating pathogen-infected cells. Memory responses have been described for CTL; thus, once an animal has been immunized and a CTL response has been generated, antigenspecific CTL can rapidly expand after subsequent exposures, similar to memory antibody responses.",

To protect the newborn against infections, antibodies are transferred in mammals from the dam to their offspring through the placenta or the colostrum. There is little or no transfer of IgG through the placenta in cows and sows; thus, it is of crucial importance that newborn calves and piglets receive colostrum during the first 24-48 h after birth (Butler, 2006) . The neonatal intestinal tract of many mammals, including cattle and swine, allows efficient absorption of Ig only during the first 24-48 h after birth. In cows, the unique IgG subclass 1 is the major antibody in the colostrum. The intestinal tract allows the absorption of Ig in calves and piglets only during the first 48 h after birth. Sow colostrum consists of 60% IgG, 30% IgA, and 10% IgM. After 48 h the composition of immunoglobulins in sow milk changes to predominantly IgA. . Maternal immunity in chickens is provided through transfer of IgY from the yolk to the embryo and newborn chicken. Although maternal immunity has been described for fish (Zhang et al., 2013) , the level of transfer of maternal antibodies to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) fry is apparently insufficient to provide protection against infection with Yersinia ruckeri (Lillehaug et al., 1996) .

Some producers of production animals believe that vaccine manufacturers can always produce better vaccines and therefore biosecurity is not very important or is even irrelevant. However, the use of vaccines can never be an excuse for poor biosecurity. Most vaccines do not provide a sterilizing immunity, meaning that vaccination may prevent disease but not prevent replication of pathogens. As a consequence escape mutants may arise for which the vaccine no longer provides protection. Premises that are poorly cleaned after a previous flock or herd has been removed may allow na\u00efve animals to be exposed by residual pathogens before the immune response matures or before solid vaccinal immunity has been established. An example of good and poor farm management for poultry is provided in Figures 1(a) and (b), respectively. In Figure 1 (b) there is no clean area directly adjacent to the poultry house. The absence of a clean area facilitates the entrance of rodents and other fomites. It will be much more difficult to control diseases under these circumstances even when vaccination procedures are correctly executed. Ideally, closed houses with proper ventilation and climate control, which are cleaned and disinfected after each cycle, are used for chickens and swine, but this is often impractical in warmer climates, especially in economically poor countries. Multiage farms, a reality in most poultry production systems for layers, are another problem for strict biosecurity, preventing thorough cleanup of the premises.",

It is important to ensure that vaccination crews and other persons visiting several farms on one day do not enter the facility without change of clothes and ideally a shower before entering the premises. A specific problem is encountered in several countries where most of the chickens are sold through live markets. Traders come to the farms to get their quota of birds, often using trucks that have not been cleaned for a long time. In this situation it is recommended that the farmer brings the birds to the entrance of the farm so that the trader does not have to enter with his truck. As a consequence of the bird flu situation, biosecurity measures have been more strictly enforced in the poultry industry over the past 5-10 years, but in many instances a critical evaluation by a qualified poultry veterinarian will result in recommendations for further improvements. For more detailed information on biosecurity measures for poultry production, the readers may refer to 'Diseases of Poultry, thirteenth ed.' (Collett, 2013) .

However, the use of a highly desirable sire can also introduce unexpected new problems, as is illustrated by the case of leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) disease. LAD has been linked to a point mutation in the gene coding for the leukocyte adhesion molecule CD18, and this defect was traced back to a specific sire Osborndale Ivanhoe, who was used extensively as a semen donor in the United States (Shuster et al., 1992) .

Genetic resistance to pathogen-induced disease can be at the level of receptors preventing infection. For example, chickens can be resistant or susceptible to infection with avian leukosis virus subgroup A (ALV-A) based on allelic differences in the receptor gene (Nair and Fadly, 2013) . The poultry breeders have used this information in their genetic selection program to generate birds resistant to ALV (McKay, 2013, personal communication) . In swine, a single-nucleotide mutation at position 307 (G/A) of the alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase (FUT1) gene, the putative receptor for F18 fimbriae of Escherichia coli, is strongly correlated with increased resistance to enterotoxigenic and verotoxigenic E. coli (Wang et al., 2012) . Atlantic salmon are highly susceptible to infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) virus, a birnavirus, which can cause 30-80% mortality during the juvenile posthatch freshwater stage. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) has been identified that confers resistance to the infection (Houston et al., 2012; Moen et al., 2009) . Including the resistance conferring QTL in the breeding program by AquaGen in Norway has led to a dramatic reduction in the incidence of IPN (Anonymous, 2013b) .",

            "text": "Genetic resistance to certain diseases can also be based on the presence of specific MHC alleles or on the identification of QTL linked to resistance. For example, in chickens resistance and susceptibility to Marek's disease have been linked to the MHC complex (reviewed by Schat and Nair, 2013) and several QTL (Cheng and Lamont, 2013) . In MD-resistant birds, viremia levels are lower than in susceptible birds during the first 14 days pi and vaccines provide better protection against virus replication in resistant than in susceptible chicken lines (Yunis et al., 2004; Schat et al., 1982) . In a multigenerational challenge study using elite egg production pure lines, Fulton et al. (2013) reported an association between Marek's disease mortality and the MHC of the sire. This information combined with selection for production traits is actively used in the selection program to improve resistance to MD (Fulton et al., 2013; McKay, personal communication) . Because this type of selection experiment is not easily reproduced for other pathogens, selection for genetic control of immune responses is used rather than selection for resistance to specific pathogens Lamont et al., 2014) . In chickens, in addition to the QTL linked to MD resistance, QTL have been identified that are linked to resistance to Salmonellosis, E. coli, coccidiosis, and infectious bursal disease (Cheng and Lamont, 2013) , but these QTL are currently not included in the breeding programs of at least one major breeder company (McKay, personal communication).",

            "text": "It is generally accepted that the use of vaccines is an essential component of disease control, which also impacts the economic production and welfare of production animals. Although disease control is the main reason to use vaccines, there are several additional considerations when determining whether vaccines should be used (McLeod and Rushton, 2007) . Of major importance are the restrictions on import and export of animals or animal products imposed by many countries. These exist as a consequence of the presence of specific diseases, such as avian influenza or foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Vaccination results in the development of antibodies, which may not differ from antibodies present after infection, thus interfering with disease monitoring. As a consequence, countries may not want to import products that are antibody positive. Avian influenza not only causes major losses for the poultry industry but is also a zoonotic disease; however, FMD is an economically important disease that does not affect humans. In the case of avian influenza, some countries allow routine vaccination of poultry, whereas others rely exclusively on 'stamping-out' and inhibition of animal movement. In some countries, ring vaccination is allowed to prevent spread of AIV, whereas poultry flocks within the infected area are euthanized. This is especially attractive if a differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy can be used as is the case in avian influenza (Suarez, 2012; Capua et al., 2003) (see Section Vaccines for Poultry). There is currently no DIVA strategy available for FMD (Clavijo et al., 2004) and many countries rely, therefore, exclusively on stamping out; this has led to significant social problems as was the case during the 2001 outbreak in England (Scudamore, 2007) . During this outbreak, the Netherlands used a ring vaccination to prevent the spread of FMD, euthanized all animals within the affected area, and subsequently destroyed the vaccinated (antibody positive) animals in order to be declared FMD free ('vaccinate to kill' policy) (Parida, 2009 ) (FMD vaccination is discussed in another article of this Encyclopedia).",

            "text": "The third reason to vaccinate is to control economically important diseases. Decisions to vaccinate or not are often based on a cost/benefit analysis. For example, in the broiler industry, economic benefits were realized after the decision was made in 1983 to add the SB-1 vaccine strain to the herpesvirus of turkeys (HVT) vaccine against Marek's disease when HVT alone no longer fully protected birds against the disease. Within 3 months the industry had calculated that the addition of SB-1 was financially advantageous by reducing the condemnation rate of diseased birds (listed as leukosis in the USDA database on condemnations in poultry) enough to offset the increased vaccine costs. Another example is related to the overall costs of vaccines and medicines in relation to the overall production costs. The cost of all vaccines and medicines for an average broiler farm in the United States is US$ 0.05 per pound (\u00bc 0.45 kg) live weight. In comparison, the chick cost is US$ 5.47 per pound live weight (Anonymous, 2013a) , with profits ranging from approximately US$ 0.10 to a loss of US$ 0.01 per pound live weight. MD vaccines are the most expensive vaccines for broilers with the average prices in the United States ranging from US$ 2.65 per 1000 doses for HVT alone to US$12.00 per 1000 doses for HVT combined with the CVI988 vaccine strain (prices quoted for 2014). To reduce these costs, MD vaccines are often diluted, especially when the condemnation rates for 'leukosis' are very low (Schat and Baranowski, 2007; Schat and Nair, 2013) . However, dilution of the vaccine reduces protection to virus replication and tumor development when birds are challenged with very virulent plus (vv \u00fe )MDV strains (Gimeno et al., 2011) increasing the possibility of selection for more virulent strains (Atkins et al., 2013) .",

Control of these diseases is frequently based on political decisions to vaccinate or to use 'stampingout.' (Inter)national or regional vaccination campaigns may be needed if vaccination is allowed, which requires the willingness to commit economic resources and the cooperation of farmers.

Most of these tests use different enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) approaches and commercial ELISA kits are available for most pathogens in cattle, swine, and poultry. Determining specific CMI responses is complicated and not used to measure vaccine responses. In chickens, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay can be used to determine whether the birds are adequately vaccinated by measuring CVI988, HVT, or SB-1 genome copies in the feather pulp between 7 and 14 days postvaccination (Baigent et al., 2006; Renz et al., 2013) .",

Typically, a virus was isolated and passed a number of times in experimental animals, embryonated chicken eggs, or cell cultures, resulting in attenuation while remaining immunogenic. Probably the first example of attenuation of a virus was the use of rabbits by Pasteur to attenuate rabies virus (reviewed in Lombard et al., 2007) . Cell culture attenuation can be achieved by passaging the virus at its optimal temperature or at lower temperatures as has been done for the cold-adapted, live human influenza vaccine (Maassab and DeBorde, 1985) . These approaches have been used successfully over the years, but the development of attenuated vaccines was empirical with often unpredictable results. Key requirements for the successful use of live virus vaccines are ease of (1) production, i.e., cell cultures using roller bottles or suspension cultures in bioreactors; (2) transport, i.e., liquid nitrogen (essential for Marek's disease vaccines), need of cold chain (either \u00c0 20 1C or 4 1C, important for most vaccines), or ambient temperature (heat tolerant); (3) administration, and (4) good replication in the vaccinated animals without causing clinical or subclinical problems. The ease of administration is discussed in more detail in the Section 'Vaccination Procedures' and potential issues with subclinical problems discussed in the section on poultry vaccines. Production of live vaccines follows detailed protocols adhering to strict standards, which are determined by governments of individual countries (e.g., the Veterinary Services of APHIS-USDA), a group of countries (e.g., the European Union), or by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) (Jones et al., 2007; Schudel, 2007) .",

            "text": "In general, the production of inactivated or killed vaccines follows similar guidelines, although somewhat more relaxed than for live vaccines. The more relaxed guidelines are best demonstrated for chicken embryo-produced killed virus vaccines. Although the production of live vaccines in embryos or chicken embryo-derived cell cultures requires the use of specific pathogen-free eggs, inactivated vaccines can be made in the so-called 'clean eggs,' which are not necessarily free of all pathogens. Inactivation can be achieved by several methods, such as treatment with alkylating agents (\u03b2-propiolactone and aminoethyl ethelene imines), different concentrations of formalin or glutaraldehyde, temperature, pH, and UV or gamma irradiation (Delrue et al., 2012) . Key concerns with the preparation of inactivated vaccines are immunogenicity and safety. Depending on the virus, some of the inactivation procedures damage the immunogenic epitopes, resulting in insufficient induction of protective immune responses. Viral safety can be compromised by incomplete inactivation of the vaccine virus or by the presence of extraneous pathogens in the cell culture media or embryos. Sera, trypsin, and embryonated chicken eggs can contain extraneous pathogens, some of which have only recently been described. The use of fetal bovine serum, for example, frequently results in contamination of vaccines with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). To avoid this problem, chemically defined cell culture media without animal components have been developed but may not be widely used for vaccines in, for example, the poultry industry. Another potential problem is incomplete inactivation of viruses belonging to the Circoviridae and the proposed new group of Anelloviridae. For example, chicken infectious anemia virus (CAV or CIAV) and porcine circovirus (PCV), belonging to the Gyrovirinae and Circovirinae subfamilies, respectively, of the Circoviridae are highly resistant to chemical inactivation (Schat and van Santen, 2013) and could remain present in inactivated vaccines. Application of PCR techniques has become a major tool to determine the absence of known extraneous agents (Mackay and Kriz, 2010) .",

For example, a live vaccine will be preferred if cell-mediated immune (CMI) responses are essential for solid protection (see Section Antigen Processing), although inclusion of some adjuvants can stimulate CMI responses (see below). A live vaccine may also be preferred if mucosal antibody responses (IgA) are needed for protection. Production of IgA antibodies is stronger after natural exposure (see Section Vaccination Procedures) than after parenteral injection, which is typically used with inactivated vaccines.

This is not always a problem; high titers can be obtained, especially when vaccines are made in embryonated chicken eggs. However, it makes the inactivated product more expensive than a live vaccine. Inactivated vaccines also have certain advantages over live vaccines. Because attenuation is not a linear process, live attenuated vaccines most likely contain populations that differ in the degree of attenuation, which may cause problems, especially if the animals are immunosuppressed by stress or subclinical immunosuppressive infections. Moreover, there is always the potential that the vaccine reverts back to become pathogenic or recombines with the wild-type viruses generating a recombinant. Live vaccines induce immune responses by replicating in the host, which can cause some degree of tissue damage. These vaccine reactions can be complicated by secondary infections leading to economic losses. Certain live vaccines are also contraindicated during pregnancies. None of these problems occur with properly inactivated vaccines except for some local tissue damage caused by adjuvants.",

The following technologies have been used to develop commercial products: deletion mutants, vectored vaccines expressing antigens to different pathogens, subunit vaccines including virus-like particles (VLP), and DNA vaccines. The basic science on which these vaccines are based is briefly discussed in this section. More detailed information can be found in several review papers and the actual use in production animals is discussed in the four sections on vaccination in production animals. Many of the biotechnology-based vaccines can be used in DIVA strategies, and specific tests to differentiate between vaccine responses and pathogen infection are an integral part of the development of these vaccines. Tests include ELISAs as well as PCR-based assays. The former confirms the absence of antibodies against the deleted gene products after vaccination, although these antibodies are present after infection with the field strains of the pathogen. In the case of AIV, recombinant vaccines produce antibodies to the neuraminidase protein that is different from the field virus. PCR-based assays can also be used as in the case with the gE deletion mutant of bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1). In this test, a gE DNA fragment is amplified and analyzed by restriction enzymes (Schynts et al., 1999) .

Since then, several deletion and insertion techniques have been developedmostly for herpesviruses and poxviruses but also for RNA viruses. The use of bacterial artificial chromosomes has increased the possibilities drastically by allowing the cloning of large DNA sequences, such as herpesvirus and poxvirus genomes and infectious cDNA (complementary DNA) clones of RNA viruses (Tischer and Kaufer, 2012) . The use of en passant mutagenesis facilitates the deletion or mutagenesis of specific genes as well as the generation of vectored vaccines expressing foreign genes (Tischer et al., 2010) . Currently, several vaccines for chickens using fowlpox or HVT as a vector and expressing genes for AIV, infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), or infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) have been licensed in the United States as well as in other parts of the world. There are currently no vectored vaccines for cattle and swine licensed in the United States (Anonymous, 2013c) , but the gE deletion mutant of BoHV-1 has been licensed in the European Union for the control and possible eradication of BoHV-1, which is the cause of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis.",

DNA vaccination is of interest because the DNA fragment codes only for part of the pathogen; thus, there is no risk that the pathogen escapes into the environment. The unmethylated CpG sequences in the DNA interacts with Toll-like receptors (TLR), thus enhancing innate responses. Interestingly, DNA vaccination sometimes induces strong CMI immune responses without the antibody responses, which complicates monitoring if appropriate levels of protection have been achieved. The proposed mechanism for the induction of both types of immune responses is that APC are directly stimulated by transfection of the plasmid into the APC or by proteins expressed in transfected somatic cells. Although DNA vaccines have attracted strong interest for their potential use in humans, the development of vaccines for production animals has been lacking with one exception. A DNA vaccine to protect salmonids against infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus has been licensed in Canada (Alonso and Leong, 2013 ) (see Section Vaccines for Fish). One of the problems is that injection of plasmids into the muscle or dermis does not always result in adequate responses without the addition of an immunogenic protein and or cytokines or unless multiple injections are given. The use of a gene gun administering gold particles coated with DNA has improved the results probably by delivering the vaccine into the epidermis, which is rich in professional APC (keratinocytes and Langerhans cells) (Fuller et al., 2006) .",

However, the depot also causes tissue damage, thus facilitating an inflammatory response (signal 2 facilitators). The former results in gradual release of the antigen to macrophages and APC, whereas the latter activates the innate immune response pathway by providing ligands to PRR, such as TLR (see Section Relevant Immune Responses).

In this article the author has briefly reviewed these different techniques: detailed information on the advantages and disadvantages has been discussed by Collett (2013) . The concept of in ovo vaccination was developed by Sharma and Burmester (1982) for the HVT Marek's disease vaccine. The development of machines for in ovo vaccination was pioneered by Embrex (now Zoetis) and is widely used to vaccinate broiler embryos. Current machines can vaccinate up to 70 000 eggs h \u00c01 and at the same time remove infertile eggs and eggs with embryos that died within the first 10 days of incubation (Figure 3) . The mechanisms involved in early protection are not completely understood but probably involve early activation of innate immune responses and, if the machine is properly calibrated, Figure 3 An automated in ovo vaccination device shown with an egg candling module and a capacity to inoculate up to 70 000 eggs h \u00c0 1 . At approximately 18 days of incubation the flats with eggs are loaded on an egg remover module (right front) where infertile eggs and eggs with dead embryos are removed, thereby reducing chances of contamination. The flats are then moved to the next module for vaccine injection/delivery through a multiple-head, injector assembly that consists of a punch and needle system. After injection, the flats are moved to the transfer table module where eggs are automatically transferred to hatching baskets to be moved into the hatching incubator. Photo of the Embrex \u00ae systems (Inovoject \u00ae vaccination device with Vaccine Saver \u00ae feature and egg remover module) courtesy of Zoetis Inc. approximately 100% of the embryos will receive the correct vaccine dose. This is in contrast with vaccination of newly hatched chicks at the hatchery by sc injection, where chicks are often not at all or improperly vaccinated. One-day-old chicks are vaccinated before leaving the hatchery by sc injection, spray, and ocular or nasal drop. Spray vaccination at the hatchery is done in a cabinet where the boxes with chicks receive the spray. At the farm, spray vaccination is often employed for respiratory vaccines using adaptations of insecticide spray equipment. Droplet size is crucial in both situations with 100-150 mm being optimal. Smaller droplets may cause undesirable vaccine reactions. The labor-intensive eye or nasal drop vaccination is probably not used in many countries due to labor costs, although it is used in countries like India at the farm level instead of spray vaccination. Vaccination by drinking water is effective but requires proper preparation of the equipment and birds. Flushing the system to remove all disinfectants is important and if the only water supply is chlorinated water it will not work at all. Before vaccinating, water must be withheld from the birds so that they drink as soon as water becomes available. Proper preparation of the vaccine solution is done by adding buffers to the drinking water (e.g., skim milk), which needs to be well mixed with the vaccine. Improper application of any of the vaccination techniques can cause disastrous results.",

The United States has been free of FMD virus (FMDV) since 1929 (McReynolds and Sanderson, 2014) , whereas FMDV is still endemic in large parts of Asia. Similar examples can be given for the poultry industry in regard to H5N1 highly pathogenic (HP)AIV. Several countries in Asia and Egypt routinely vaccinate against the H5N1 AIV, whereas countries in Europe may use stamping out; however, the United States is free of HPAIV. Decisions on how to deal with these two diseases are determined by the national governments or the European Union.",

The host response and pathogenesis of bacterial intramammary infections have recently been reviewed (Schukken et al., 2011) and the interested reader may refer to this article for additional information. Production losses are caused by clinical mastitis, an obvious disease state, or subclinical mastitis when the somatic cell count (mostly leukocytes and some epithelial cells) is increased above 100 000 ml \u00c01 of milk. Prevention of mastitis is primarily based on sound management practices and vaccination is considered an adjunct to the overall herd health management programs (Erskine, 2012) . Vaccines against coliforms consist of Gram-negative 'core antigen' bacterins, referred to as GNCABs, using the Rc mutant strain O111:B4 of E. coli. Vaccination with this vaccine, referred to as J5, provides moderate protection against coliforms. More problematic is the control of St. aureus mastitis by vaccination. Pereira et al. (2011) and Erskine (2012) reviewed the literature on St. aureus vaccines and found mixed results for the current commercial vaccines. New vaccine formulations using recombinant Target of RNAIII-Activating Protein (TRAP) (Leitner et al., 2011) and ISCOMATRIX\u2122 (Camussone et al., 2013) show promising results for improved protection.",

Second, there are at least seven distinct serotypes with considerable antigenic diversity within serotypes. As a consequence, vaccine formulations need to be carefully evaluated for efficacy, which is difficult to achieve. Challenge experiments for such evaluations require strict isolation facilities to prevent outbreaks.

On some farms, all units are used in a continuous production system, preventing the use of an all-in/all-out system and thorough cleaning of the facilities. Other systems use fully separated facilities and the grower/finishing units may be completely different farms than the farrowing/nursery farms. Piglets are moved to nursery units after weaning at approximately 3 weeks of age, which is also the prime time for vaccinations by injection. In some instances a booster vaccination is given at 6 weeks of age. Sows can be vaccinated between 2 and 5 weeks before farrowing to increase antibodies in the colostrum. Although most vaccines are given by injection, attenuated live strains of bacteria (Lawsonia intracellularis causing ileitis and Salmonella and E. coli causing diarrhea) can be given in the drinking water. Over the past 20 years, two important new diseases have appeared worldwide in swine: PCV serotype 2 (PCV2) causing immunosuppression and wasting pigs, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by Arterivirus. Recombinant vaccines have been developed against PCV2 using VLP (Merck), a recombinant protein produced in a baculovirus system (Boehringer Ingelheim) or a recombinant hybrid inserting the VP2 gene of PCV2 into the genome of the nonpathogenic PCV serotype 1 virus (Zoetis). The latter is the only live vaccine against PCV2. Development of vaccines against PRRS is problematic for several reasons (Cruz et al., 2010) . Natural infection or attenuated vaccines induce weak innate immune responses and low levels of VN antibodies and virus-specific CTL. Moreover, PRRSV strains are highly diverse, especially for the immunodominant protein GP5. It is also suggested that CTL responses are more important for protective immunity than VN antibodies. Development of recombinant vaccines inducing strong CTL responses may solve the shortcomings of the current vaccines. Cruz et al. (2010) used a vectored vaccine with transmissible gastroenteritis virus as the backbone expressing two PRRSV antigens eliciting strong VN antibody and CTL responses as well as good mucosal immunity. Currently, this type of recombinant vaccine has not been licensed.",

Interestingly, HVT-vectored vaccines cannot be used together with conventional HVT, nor can different recombinant vaccines be used at the same time (e.g., HVT-IBD and HVT-NDV) unless the two inserts are present in the same vector. Possible explanations are that the insert negatively influences the replication rate of the vectored vaccine in the bird with the consequence that conventional HVT initiates immune responses before the recombinant HVT, thus curtailing the infection of the latter. The second explanation could be that the vectored vaccine has a higher passage level in vitro and therefore replicates slower in the bird with the same consequences. Similar circumstances may explain the recommendation against using two different recombinant HVT vaccines. The consequence of using recombinant HVT instead of the standard HVT is that protection against MD may be suboptimal and therefore protection to MD depends more on the inclusion of SB-1 and or CVI988 (aka as Rispens). The slower replication of, for example, recombinant HVT expressing VP2 of IBDV may still protect against IBD because maternal antibodies will provide sufficient protection against IBD during the first 14 days after hatching.",

Chickens make antibodies against both proteins, but the antibodies against H are the key for neutralizing the virus. By changing the N gene to a different neuraminidase gene (e.g., N2 in the case of a vaccine against H5N1), it is possible to monitor flocks for field exposure to H5N1.

Vaccine development has become an integral part of aquaculture management for these species and several review papers have summarized the availability of vaccines against viral and bacterial diseases (Gomez-Casado et al., 2011; Salgado-Miranda et al., 2013; Brudeseth et al., 2013) . One of the problems identified in these papers relates to the fact that almost all vaccines consist of water-inoil emulsions that need to be injected. The adjuvants in the vaccine can cause adhesions in the peritoneal cavity, which negatively influences the quality of the fish meat. To reduce the impact of adjuvants on the meat quality, multivalent vaccines that contain antigens against different pathogens are frequently used. The type of combinations depends on the geographic locations (Brudeseth et al., 2013) . The other major problem is that a number of viral diseases can cause high mortality in swim-up fry. Unfortunately, the very young fish have an immature immune system, are too small to be injected, and maternal immunity is not very effective in fish (see Section Maternal Immunity). Live, attenuated vaccine strains cannot be used mainly because attenuation in one fish species does not translate to attenuation in other fish species. Vaccination by immersion is in general not cost effective, although it is used with some bacterins in channel catfish and salmonids (e.g., Yersinia ruckeri bacterin).",
