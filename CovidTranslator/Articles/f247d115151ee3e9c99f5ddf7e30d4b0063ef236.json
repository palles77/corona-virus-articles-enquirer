In this study, we characterized an EBOV-glycoprotein (GP) pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system in different cell cultures, including human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and human macrophages, for the screening of anti-EBOV-GP agent(s). Based on this system, we demonstrated that an aqueous extract (CHPV) from the Chinese herb Prunella vulgaris displayed a potent inhibitory effect on EBOV-GP pseudotyped virus (EBOV-GP-V)-mediated infection in various cell lines, including HUVEC and macrophage. In addition, our results indicated that CHPV was able to block an eGFP-expressing Zaire ebola virus (eGFP-ZEBOV) infection in VeroE6 cells. The anti-EBOV activity of CHPV was exhibited in a dose-dependent manner. At a 12.5 mg/ml concentration, the CHPV showed a greater than 80% inhibition of EBOV-GP-V and eGFP-EBOV infections. Likewise, our studies suggested that the inhibitory effect of CHPV occurred by binding directly to EBOV-GP-Vs and blocking the early viral events. Interestingly, our results have shown that CHPV was able to enhance the anti-EBOV activity of the monoclonal antibody MAb 2G4 against EBOV-GP. Overall, this study provides evidence that CHPV has anti-EBOV activity and may be developed as a novel antiviral approach against EBOV infection.",

Recently, a novel immunotherapeutic (ZMapp) consisting of a combination of monoclonal antibodies (c13C6, c2G4 and c4G7) and optimized from two previous antibody cocktails (MB-003 and ZMAb) was shown to be able to rescue 100% of rhesus macaques when treatment is initiated up to 5 days postechallenge (Murin et al., 2014; Pettitt et al., 2013; Qiu et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014) . The monoclonal antibodies target the GP1-GP2 interface and the glycan cap, thereby inhibiting viral entry Qiu et al., 2011 Qiu et al., , 2012a . During the 2014 EBOV outbreak in Western Africa, ZMapp was administered to seven patients with Ebola virus disease (EVD) in the United States and several other countries, but the outcome was not considered to be statistically significant (McCarthy, 2014) . Moreover, very little of the ZMapp antibodies is currently available (Lenny Bernstein, 2014) . Thus, the lack of ZMapp and unavailability of experimental treatment in the most affected regions of the EBOV outbreak in Western Africa hinder its development in sourcelimited countries.",

Many aqueous extracts of traditional Chinese medicinal herbs have been proven to have antiviral activities (Zheng, 1990) , and most of these are generally of low toxicity, cheap and readily accessible. Some Chinese herbs, including Prunella vulgaris, L. Panaxginseng C.A. Meyer, Andrographis paniculata, Lentinus edodes and Spirulina platensis, display inhibitory effects on the entry step of various viruses, such as HIV-1, Hepatitis B and HSV-1 (Chang et al., 1991; Fiore et al., 2008; Harada, 2005; Hayashi et al., 1996a Hayashi et al., , 1996b Hayashi, 2008; Kang et al., 2013; Lee et al., 2014; Li et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2002; Sato et al., 1996; Seubsasana et al., 2011; Tabba et al., 1989; Yao et al., 1992; Yoshida et al., 1988; Zhang et al., 2007) . However, whether these herbs could also have inhibitory activities against EBOV infection remains unknown. In this study, we developed a sensitive EBOV-GP pseudotyped HIV-1-based vector system for screening anti-EBOV agent(s) and then investigated the antiviral mechanism of action. Based on this system, we identified an aqueous extract from the Chinese herb P. vulgaris (CHPV), which was able to inhibit EBOV-GP-V and eGFP-Ebola virus infections by binding to EBOV-GP and blocking viral entry. Interestingly, our results also showed that CHPV was able to enhance the anti-EBOV activity of the monoclonal antibody MAb 2G4 against EBOV-GP. Thus, this study provides evidence for the first time that CHPV, an aqueous extract from P. vulgaris, has potent anti-EBOV activity.",

As expected, abundant GP1 was detected in EBOV-GP-Vs, indicating that EBOV-GP can be efficiently incorporated into the pseudovirions (Fig. 1B, lane 3) .

In contrast, EBOV-GP-V was unable to induce detectable levels of Gluc activity in both the Jurkat and C8166 T-lymphoid cells.

The results in Fig. 3A show that when cells were pretreated with CHPV for 2 and 4 h and then removed before adding pseudovirions, there was no inhibitory effect on virus infection (Fig. 3A) , suggesting that the inhibitory activity of CHPV did not act directly on cells to render them resistant to infection. Interestingly, when the cells were incubated simultaneously with EBOV-GP-V and CHPV, a strong inhibitory effect was achieved, with no negative impact on viral infection when CHPV was added at 2 or more hrs post-infection (Fig. 3A) . All of these results revealed that CHPV blocks EBOV-GP-V replication in the early steps of the infection. This also led us to believe that the major inhibitory effect of CHPV may be through its action on the virus itself. As shown in Fig. 3B , EBOV-GP-Vs were first incubated with CHPV (10 mg/mL) for 10 min at 4 C. The CHPV-treated viruses were pelleted by ultracentrifugation and washed once with media to remove residual unbound CHPV (Fig. 3B) . As a control, EBOV-GP-Vs were incubated with the anti-EBOV-GP antibody 2G4 or media alone and were pelleted by ultracentrifugation. All pelleted viruses were used to infect HEK293T cells, and the Gluc activity was measured at 48 h post-infection. Similar to the pseudovirions incubated with 2G4, the pseudovirions pre-treated with CHPV also displayed a significant reduction of infection ability, when compared with the pseudovirions that were incubated with medium alone (Fig. 3C) .",

As shown in Fig. 3D , the CHPV in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation still showed strong antiviral activity compared with the EBOV-GP-Vs infection in the absence of CHPV. In contrast, the pellet portion did not exert any antiviral activity (Fig. 3D) , indicating that the soluble active constituents of CHPV could not be pelleted.

Some studies suggest that EBOV-GP is the main determinant of vascular cell injury (Yang et al., 1998 (Yang et al., , 2000 . As we demonstrated in Fig. 1E , HUVECs were extremely sensitive to EBOV. Therefore, we choose primary HUVECs as target cells to evaluate if CHPV could also protect HUVECs from EBOV-GP infection. Briefly, various concentrations of CHPV were mixed with EBOV-GP-V and added immediately onto HUVECs. At 2 h post-infection, the cells were washed and cultured in medium without the herb. As expected, upon an increase in the concentration of CHPV, the Gluc activities of EBOV-GP-V-infected HUVECs decreased in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A) , indicating that the EBOV-GP-V infection in HUVECs was specifically blocked by CHPV.

Infected macrophages can attract more target cells, induce and increase vasodilatation, vascular permeability and disseminated intravascular coagulation by producing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Bray and Geisbert, 2005) . Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the inhibitory effect of CHPV on EBOV-GP-V infection in macrophages. We first tested the effect of CHPV by incubating human primary macrophages with CHPV and EBOV-GP-V for 4 h. As shown in Fig. 4C (the 4 bars on the right side), the Gluc activity of supernatant from infected macrophages significantly decreased at 24 and 48 h in the presence of CHPV (20 mg/ml). We also infected macrophages in the presence of CHPV and maintained the macrophages in the medium containing EBOV-GP-Vs and CHPV for 48 h without washing. In this case, the EBOV-GP-Vs infection was inhibited by CHPV and the inhibition rate was as high as 95% compared with the positive control (Fig. 4C , left 4 bars), suggesting that the optimum inhibitory effect of CHPV could be obtained when there was a continuous presence of CHPV in the culture medium. Additionally, we observed no cytotoxic effect when 20 mg/ml of CHPV was present in the macrophages culture for 48 h (data not shown).",

Interestingly, a greater than 90% inhibitory effect was achieved when CHPV (10 mg/ml) was combined with 2G4 at concentrations above 1.6 mg/ml. The additive effect was more evident when a lower concentration (0.625 mg/ml) of CHPV was combined with different doses of 2G4. For example, when 1.6 mg/ml 2G4 and 0.625 mg/mL CHPV were added alone, 56% and 26% inhibition were obtained, respectively. When these two drugs were added together at the same concentration, 81% inhibition was observed. This clearly indicates that a much stronger inhibition could be achieved through the combined use of 2G4 and CHPV, as opposed to using each treatment alone. It is obvious that to achieve the same level of inhibition, the MAb dosage could be reduced in the presence of CHPV. A similar phenomenon was observed in macrophages: at 4 h postinfection with pseudovirions in the presence of CHPV, in the presence or absence of 2G4 in macrophages (Fig. 5B) , the combination of CHPV (20 mg/ml) with 2G4 (1.6 mg/ml) could further decrease the infectivity of EBOV-GP-V compared with that of CHPV (20 mg/ml) or 2G4 (16 mg/ml) alone. Remarkably, when CHPV and 2G4 were added 1 h before infection, with the same amount of CHPV and 2G4 maintained during the course of infection, the infection of EBOV-GP-V was completely inhibited (Fig. 5C ).",

To address this question, we performed an eGFP-ZEBOV infection in the presence of CHPV or 2G4 antibody in VeroE6 cells. Briefly, different concentrations of CHPV or 2G4 antibody were added to VeroE6 cell cultures for 10 min, then the cells were infected by 100 PFU of eGFP-ZEBOV in the presence of same concentrations of CHPV or 2G4. After 12 h of infection, the cells were washed and cultured with fresh medium without any drug. At 48 h post-infection, we did not observe any CPHV-induced toxic effect on the cells, and the cells were fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and fluorescent plaques were counted using an AID fluorescent plate reader. Remarkably, results revealed that the presence of 6.25 ug/ml of CHPV reduced more than 50% of eGFP-ZEBOV infection, while in the presence of 25 ug/ ml of CHPV, eGFP-ZEBOV infection was inhibited by approximately 80% (Fig. 6A ). In agreement with previous reports, 2G4 also showed a very strong blocking effect against Ebola virus infection Qiu et al., 2011) . At 0.6 mg/ml concentration of 2G4 antibody, approximately 80% of virus infection was blocked (Fig. 6A) . These results provide strong evidence that CHPV is able to inhibit EBOV infection.",

The infectivity of the pelleted pseudovirions was tested by adding to HEK293T cells, and the Gluc activity after 48 h was shown as a relative ratio when compared with the virus incubated with DMEM. PC: EBOV-GP-V not treated with drug. (D) The same amount of CHPV was ultracentrifuged. The resulting supernatant and the pellet were incubated with EBOV-GP-V and added to HEK293T cells. The Gluc activity after 48 h is shown as a percentage of control activity (%). The results are the mean values \u00b1 standard deviations (SD) of three independent experiments. (E) CHPV blocks the attachment of EBOV-GP-V. The same amount of EBOV-GP-Vs (P24, 0.51 ng) and various concentration of CHPV were added to HEK293T cells on ice for 1 h. The sample without pseudovirions or CHPV treatment was used as a negative control. The cells were then washed with cold PBS to remove unbound virus and lysed by RIPA buffer. The viruses attached to cells were monitored by measuring the HIV p24 antigen levels by anti-p24 ELISA. ZEBOV infection, as described above. After 48 h of infection, the cells were fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and The inhibitory effect of CHPV in the presence or absence of 2G4 in macrophages. The positive control (PC) was infected macrophages in the absence of CHPV or 2G4. EBOV-GP-V was mixed with CHPV (20 ug/ml) in the presence of absence of 2G4 (16 or 1.6 ug/ml) and immediately added onto the cell culture, followed by washing of the cells after 4 h of incubation. The cells were then cultured in medium without CHPV. The supernatants were collected at 24 and 48 h post-infection and used to detect Gluc activity. The major scales of the Y-axis on the left and on the right are different, with 0.5 units and 1 unit, respectively. (C) The same amounts of EBOV-GP-Vs in the presence or absence of 2G4 (1.6 ug/ml) were added onto CHPV (20 mg/mL)-preincubated (1 h) macrophages, and the same amount of CHPV with or without 1.6 ug/mL 2G4 was maintained during the course of infection. The positive control (PC) was infected macrophages in the absence of CHPV or 2G4. The supernatants were collected, and the Gluc activity was tested after 48 h of continuous culture without washing. The major scale base of the Y-axis is 0.5 units on the left and 2 units on the right. fluorescent plaques were counted using an AID fluorescent plate reader. Interestingly, the combined treatment of 2G4/CHPV potentiated inhibition against eGFP-ZEBOV infection (Fig. 6B) , as results revealed that while treatment with 0.31 or 1.2 ug/ml of 2G4 alone reduced eGFP-ZEBOV infection to approximately 25% or 17%, respectively, the presence of 2G4/CHPV (0.31 ug/6.25 mg or 1.2 mg/ 25 ug/ml) reduced eGFP-ZEBOV infection to approximately 17% or 6%, respectively, compared with eGFP-ZEBOV infection in the absence of antibody and CHPV (Fig. 6B ). This indicates that combined treatment with 2G4 and CHPV during EBOV infection could achieve a better inhibitory effect against viral infection.",

            "text": "Due to the fact EBOV is classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen, the study of its replication, as well as the testing of anti-EBOV drugs, requires biosafety level 4 containment (BSL-4) and procedures, significantly limiting the EBOV-related research activities of many microbiology laboratories. To overcome these limitations, several previous studies have examined the use of EBOV-GP pseudotyped viral vectors in a BSL-2 environment, including replicationdefective MLV and HIV, replication-competent vesicular stomatitis virus and Newcastle disease virus, for investigation of EBOV-GPmediated virus entry mechanism and for the screening of new therapeutic agent(s) (Basu et al., 2011; DiNapoli et al., 2010; Takada et al., 1997; Wen et al., 2013; Wong et al., 2010; Wool-Lewis and Bates, 1998; Yang et al., 1998; Yonezawa et al., 2005) . In these studies, the entry of pseudotyped virus-like particles were monitored by using enzymes or biological markers expressed when the pseudovirions gained entry into the cells. In this study, we used a sensitive Ebola-GP-mediated HIV-based vector system, which contains a Gaussia luciferase (Gluc) gene as a reporter (Fig. 1A) . Because Gluc can be secreted into the supernatant after being expressed, this assay makes it more practical to evaluate and quantify the level of EBOV-GP-mediated virus entry and can be used for anti-Ebola-GP drug screening in a BSL-2 environment. Our results demonstrate that the infection of EBOV-GP-V required a functional EBOV-GP-mediated cell entry, which was neutralized by MAb 2G4, which is specific for EBOV-GP (Fig. 1D) .",

Remarkably, CHPV could efficiently inhibit the infection of EBOV-GP pseudovirions in its primary target cell, the human macrophage. The inhibition rate reached as high as 99.5% when CHPV (20 ug/ml) was continually present in the culture medium (Fig. 5C) . The same concentration of CHPV could inhibit approximately 80% of viral infectivity in HUVECs, even after cells were treated for only 2 h with CHPV and virus added soon after (Fig. 4) . Moreover, our study has clearly shown that 1.25 ug/ml of CHPV reduced the wild type EBOV infection by 50%, while in the presence of 12.5 mg of CHPV, EBOV virus infection was inhibited by more than 80% (Fig. 6A) . These observations provide convincing evidence for CHPV as a potential agent against EBOV that deserves further investigation in animal studies.",

            "text": "To investigate the CHPV anti-EBOV mechanism of action, a \"time-of-addition\" study was performed. Here, CHPV was identified as having blocked EBOV-GP-V infection, possibly by suppressing virus attachment through targeting the viral GP protein (Fig. 3) . Previous studies demonstrated that aqueous extracts of PV can decrease the replication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) by preventing virus binding to cells (Chiu et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2007) and inhibit HIV-1 infection through prevention of viral attachment to the CD4 \u00fe T cell receptor (Oh et al., 2011; Tabba et al., 1989; Yao et al., 1992) , suggesting that CHPV targets an invariant component among these viruses. In fact, it was suggested that the antiviral activity of CHPV might be related to an anionic polysaccharide. Polysaccharide can form complexes with virus proteins, which is likely to occur mainly through the formation of salt linkages or ion pairs between oppositely charged groups on the polymers and the virus proteins, ultimately blocking virus entry (Izumi et al., 1994) . For example, it is well established that sulfated polysaccharide can selectively interact with the polycationic V3 loop, which is a highly basic region on gp120 (Huang et al., 2005) , to interfere with the attachment of HIV to cell-surface receptors (Harrop and Rider, 1998; Moulard et al., 2000; Vives et al., 2005) . Whether a polyanionic property is responsible for the viral entry inhibition mechanism of CHPV remains to be determined. However, at this point, we also could not rule out the possibility that the presence of CHPV might also result in conformational changes in EBOV-GP and render it unable to interact with its receptor, which requires further investigation. The questions of the specificity of the antiviral activity of CHPV and whether CHPV can act against all viruses or only for enveloped viruses still remain unanswered. A concentrations of CHPV were 2-fold dilutions beginning with 100 mg/ml down to 0.78 mg/ml, and 2G4 was started with 2.5 mg/ml followed by 2-fold dilutions down to 0.020 mg/ml. The indicated concentrations of CHPV or MAb alone were added to VeroE6 cells (A) or different concentrations of CHPV or MAb were mixed (as indicated) and added to VeroE6 cells (B) before exposure of the cells to 100 PFU of eGFP-ZEBOV. After incubating for12 h, the medium was changed with fresh medium. At 48 h later, cells were fixed with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and fluorescent plaques were counted using an AID fluorescent plate reader. Error bars represent variation between triplicate samples, and the data of (A) and (B) are representative of results obtained in two independent experiments. previous report has shown that a polysaccharide from P. vulgaris (at 100 ug/ml) was active against the HIV-1 and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2), but was unable to inhibit cytomegalovirus (CMV), human influenza virus types A and B, poliovirus type 1 or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Xu et al., 1999) . Consistently, our data also indicated that CHPV could not inhibit VSV-G pseudovirion infection (data not shown). Thus, CHPV action appears to be specific to certain virus species. In addition, our data also revealed that CHPV does not act on the cell surface or change its susceptibility to HIV (Yao et al., 1992) or EBOV (Fig. 3A) . Thus, all of these observations suggest that there is a specificity of the antiviral effect of CHPV. However, the underlying molecular mechanism(s) requires further investigation.",

Therefore, the discovery of other agents capable of preventing EBOV virus infection or contributing to the enhancement of Mab-mediated anti-EBOV effects is needed. We investigated whether the presence of CHPV and 2G4 together would demonstrate a stronger anti-EBOV effect. The results showed that the combined use of lower concentrations of both 2G4 and CHPV could achieve the same anti-EBOV-GP efficiency as a high concentration of 2G4 alone (Figs. 5 and 6B). The reason for this might be due to a combined effect through their different binding mechanisms. The 2G4 monoclonal antibody has been known to bind to the GP2 fusion loop, which is important for viral entry Qiu et al., 2011) . In contrast, the action of CHPV is speculated to target the GP1, due to the mucinlike domain in GP1 that is responsible for viral attachment (Lin et al., 2003; Simmons et al., 2003 Simmons et al., , 2002 Takada et al., 2004) and the fact that CHPV exerts its effect during the attachment of virus to the cells. Additionally, we could not exclude the possibility that CHPV may also bind to the GP2 fusion region, which requires further investigation. This combined effect is significant, as (i) similar efficiencies would be achieved by using reduced amounts of antibody and CHPV, (ii) the combination of 2G4 and CHPV will reduce the likelihood of viral resistance and (iii) the therapeutic window could be extended by continuous use of CHPV in an infected individual. In addition, many studies have demonstrated that the aqueous extract contains many components having immunomodulatory effects (Ahn et al., 2003; Fang et al., 2005a Fang et al., , 2005b Psotova et al., 2003; Ryu et al., 2000; Shin et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2005; Won et al., 2003) . It is also possible that CHPV could be a combination of several active ingredients, which requires further investigation. Thus, aside from directly having an anti-EBOV effect, CHPV might also have great potential as an immunomodulator to suppress the severe upset and disorder of the immune cell proliferation and contraction caused by EBOV infection, further extending the antibody therapeutic window.",
