The battle against infectious diseases is meeting new challenges, with newly emerging and re-emerging infections. Both natural disaster epidemics, such as SARS, avian influenza, haemorrhagic fevers, XDR and MDR tuberculosis and many others, and the possibility of intentional mis-use, such as letters containing anthrax spores in USA, 2001, have raised awareness of the real threats. Many great men, including Goethe, Spinoza, J.B. Shaw, Fr. Engels, J.F. Kennedy and others, have recognized that liberty is also a responsibility. That is why the liberty to decide now represents an acknowledged necessity: biomedical research should be supported, conducted and published with appropriate measures to prevent potential ''dual use''. Biomedical scientists should work according to the ethical principles of their Code of Conduct, an analogue of Hippocrates Oath of doctors; and they should inform government, society and their juniors about the problem. National science consulting boards of experts should be created to prepare guidelines and control the problem at state level. An international board should develop minimum standards to be applicable by each country. Bio-preparedness is considered another key-measure.",

A stormy development was noted in molecular biology and genetics, biotechnology, genomics, proteomics, nano-technology and signal replication. In health-care, synthesis of life-saving drugs, including hormones (e.g. insulin), development of vaccines, in vitro fertilization, gene manipulation in genetic disorders and insights in patho-physiology of diseases are among the most important achievements that improve the quality and duration of life. However, the shade of so called ''dual-use'' sometimes appears to creep up behind the scientific research [1] [2] [3] [4] .",

Tuberculosis, an old disease, considered almost eradicated in developed countries, is re-emerging now with severe variants-multidrug-and extensively-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB and XDR-TB). Pulmonary tuberculosis is typical example of air-born infection and Mycobacterium tuberculosis spreads person to person via nuclei of respiratory tract secretions containing microbes. MDR strains are defined by resistance to isoniazide + rifampicin (two basic anti-tuberculosis drugs), while the XDR-strains are additionally resistant to at least one fluoroquinolon and one second line parenteral drug [64] . The treatment is very difficult, longer and more expensive than treatment of infections with susceptible strains. The resurgence of tuberculosis and the presentation of MDR-TB and XDR-TB is generally associated with noncompliance with treatment, as well as an infection in HIV-infected patients or poverty. There is a BCG vaccine and other vaccines under development. Infection control necessitates air-born isolation with respiratory masks and respirators; and protection of laboratory workers by use of safety cabinets. Aerosol dispersion of MDR-or XDR-TB strains as bioterrorist attack may have significant health-care consequences.",

Rapid diagnosis is of vital importance for the successful treatment and control of infection. The diagnosis might be difficult, because of unusual illness, typically not considered, the symptoms may differ from the natural appearance because of atypical spread, and the disease might not have been seen in this region previously [51] [52] [53] [54] . In such situations, several patients with similar symptoms should be considered an outbreak. It is necessary to emphasize that to be successful, the emergency post-exposure prophylaxis and treatment with vaccines and antibiotics respectively, if available, should start immediately since the exposure. In this respect the rapid (real-time microbiological diagnosis/identification of the pathogen is crucial (the development of typical clinical symptoms usually requires more time).",

Today, in 2008, the following issues seem reasonable: First of all, the Scientific Community, the scientists creating the progress in biology and medicine, should be aware of the dual-use dilemma [65] . They should be educated to be careful and know how to keep their own developments away from a potential mis-use. Secondly, it is considered that The Code of Conduct of Scientists will play a central role in future scientific work [66] . The Code of Conduct of scientists, criminalizing bioterrorism and mis-use of dual-use bio-medical research, should be regarded as a Scientists Oath in front of the society, as an analogue of the Hippocratic Oath of doctors [67] .",
