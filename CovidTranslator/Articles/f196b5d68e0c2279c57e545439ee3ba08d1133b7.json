            "text": "A novel coronavirus causing severe respiratory infection was first described in September 2012. 1 The virus, which later became known as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), belongs to lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus and is closely related to bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5. 2, 3 Though an animal reservoir is considered likely, none has been identified yet. 4 The exact mechanism through which MERS-CoV infection is acquired remains uncertain. Up to 24 July 2013, a total of 90 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO), including 45 deaths. The majority of infections are sporadic. Human to human transmission has been documented in at least 3 hospital settings 6-8 and 4 community clusters. [9] [10] [11] [12] We report the clinical and epidemiological details of a second family cluster of two confirmed and one probable MERS-CoV infections in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, occurred in February and March 2013. We hypothesize that the index case in the cluster is likely to have acquired the infection whilst in hospital from a contact with unrecognized MERS-CoV infection. Results: The first patient developed respiratory symptoms and fever 14 days after admission to hospital for an unrelated reason. He died 11 days later with multi-organ failure. Two of his brothers presented later to another hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever. MERS-CoV infection in the latter 2 patients was confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. All 3 patients had fever, cough, shortness of breath, bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia and rises in serum creatinine kinase and alanine transaminase. No hospital or other social contacts are known to have acquired the infection. It appears that the index patient in this cluster acquired MERS-CoV infection whilst in hospital from an unrecognized mild or asymptomatic case. Conclusion: MERS-CoV acquisition from unrecognized mild or asymptomatic cases may be a more important contributor to ongoing transmission than previously appreciated. Figure 1 ). He received vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, azithromycin and oseltamivir, in addition to intravenous hydrocortisone and high flow oxygen by a face mask. Twenty-four hours later, he required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The next day, vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam were substituted with linezolid and imipenem and his ventilation was switched to high frequency oscillatory mode. On 2 March 2013, continuing respiratory failure prompted a shift to extra-corporal membrane oxygenation. The patient's clinical condition failed to improve and he passed away 2 hours later, 7 days after the onset of symptoms. Cultures of blood, urine and sputum taken at the time of admission to hospital were all negative. Candida albicans was isolated from culture of sputum taken on 2 March 2013. Sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and mycobacterial cultures were negative. Patient 3, a 40-year old brother to patient 1 and 2, became ill on 2 March 2013. He was overweight but had no pre-existing chronic medical illness. He was admitted to Hospital B on 4 March 2013 with fever and cough productive of clear sputum. His initial chest x-ray was unremarkable. He received ceftriaxone, azithromycin and oseltamivir. A chest x-ray, taken 3 days later, showed focal areas of consolidation in the right middle and upper lobes. A computerized axial tomographic scan of the chest showed bilateral, peripheral air space consolidation with some degree of ground glass changes ( Figure 2 ). His clinical course remained largely uncomplicated. He did not receive any corticosteroids, immune modulatory therapy or antivirals other than oseltamivir. Patient 3 was discharged from hospital alive and well on 11 March 2013. Cultures of respiratory tract samples, blood and urine were all negative. Sputum smear microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and mycobacterial cultures were also negative.",

There were 10 adults in the household; the mother, who had history of Patient 1 was initially admitted to a curtained-off bed in the Emergency Department where he stayed for 9 days. He was then transferred to a 2-bedded room in a medical ward where he stayed for 2 nights. A comatose patient, who had no visitors, occupied the second bed in the room. Patient 1 was moved once more to another 2-bedded room in the same ward. His roommate was discharged home 2 days later and the bed remained unoccupied for the remainder of the time that Patient 1 was in the room. Patient 2 and Patient 3 visited Patient 1 in the ward and in the ICU several time but usually did not stay for too long. Numerous friends, relatives and work colleagues visited Patient 1 while he was in the ward, before developing fever and respiratory symptoms. Patient 1's wife and 2 of his unaffected brothers spent especially long periods of time at his bedside throughout his hospital admission. All nursing and medical care for Patient 1 followed standard infection control precautions. Influenza was suspected upon Patient 2's admission to Hospital B. He was transferred to a single room within 2 hours of his arrival and healthcare staff implemented contact and droplet infection control precautions throughout the patient's hospital stay. 15 The patient's visitors were directed to do the same. On clinical deterioration, Patient 2 was transferred to the Resuscitation Bay in the main Emergency Department, where he was intubated in the presence of 5 healthcare workers (HCWs), all of whom wore surgical masks, gloves and full-length isolation gowns. Patient 2 was later transferred to a single room in the ICU, where droplet and contact precautions continued.",

Moreover, all household contacts were followed daily for 14 days for presence of respiratory symptoms and none developed any. Serum samples were also obtained and stored pending the availability of validated serological assays. In the ensuing weeks, no HCWs in either hospital developed any symptoms to fulfill the surveillance requirement for MER-CoV testing. 16 Patient 2 was overtly symptomatic during Patient 1's funeral.

He had spent 9 days in the Emergency Department before he was transferred to 2 different 2-bedded rooms. The upper end of MERS-CoV incubation period is thought to be around 14 days, with most patients having symptoms within the first week of contact. 8, 18 It is therefore likely that Patient 1 acquired MERS-CoV infection during his hospitalization. This could have been from an asymptomatic HCW, one of the patients who were placed in close proximity to Patient 1 during his stay in the Emergency Department or from one of the numerous visitors he received whilst in the medical ward. In a previously described family cluster of MER-CoV infections, the index patient had a protracted clinical course including urinary tract infection and cardiac failure before respiratory infection became apparent. 10 The authors suggest that in-hospital acquisition might be one explanation. Furthermore, in the largest human-to-human cluster of MERS-CoV infections described so far, one of the index cases was identified as a probable case based on his son's subsequent positive test. 8 Unrecognized MERS-CoV infection in the community and in healthcare settings may be a more significant problem than previously appreciated.",

None of them was apparently infected. This is not dissimilar to the observations from four previous extensive public health investigations into cases of MERS-CoV infections. Out of over 400 HCWs who had been in contact with 31 patients in 4 different countries, only 2 had documented MERV-CoV infection. 8, 9, 20, 21 Whether HCWs play a role in transmitting MERS-CoV through hand and surface contamination is an interesting but yet unproven hypothesis. Fourteen confirmed cases of asymptomatic MERS-CoV infection have so far been reported to the WHO, including 4 HCWs. 22 Such asymptomatic carriage may explain some of the transmission that has taken place in hospital and in community settings. Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses of the available MERS-CoV genomes suggested a common ancestor halfway through the year 2011. 8, 19 It appears that the virus circulated in the community for at least one year before the first clinical case was recognized.",

Previous studies showed that from the onset of illness, MERS-CoV was detectable by RT-PCR up to 14 days in lower airway samples, 13 days in urine and 16 days in stool. 7, 19, 24 The importance of stringent infection control practice to interrupt any potential sustained MERS-CoV transmission can not be over stated.",

The high mortality rate associated with MERS-CoV infection increasingly appears to be due to the under-diagnosis of mild and asymptomatic cases as a result of the restrictive case definition put forward by WHO. 16 All 3 patients in our report had fever, cough, shortness of breath, pulmonary infiltrates on chest xrays, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and rises in serum creatinine kinase and alanine transaminase. All these are relatively common clinical features amongst patients with MERS-CoV infection ( Table 1 ). Many of these were also seen in patients affected by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreak in 2003; however, the 2 diseases have distinctly different infectivity patterns. 25 Although not necessarily diagnostic, the presence of these findings without an alternative explanation should prompt earlier consideration of MERS-CoV infection and initiation of appropriate investigations. It should be noted that collating data from small reports in order to understand the clinical features of an emergent infection has numerous selfevident limitations. A global, collaborative effort among clinicians and scientists studying this disease is needed to develop and identify more predictive diagnostic and prognostic markers. 26 A number of knowledge gaps remain in relation to MERS-CoV infection. These include identification of its source and intermediate host and better understanding of the pathogenesis, infectivity and risk factors. Further work is also needed to optimize MERS-CoV diagnostic assays and to identify the most effective therapeutic interventions. The existing number of cases globally over the past 2 years is relatively small to address all these areas.",
