Increasing evidence shows that natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in control of HIV infection but the mechanism(s) by which they mediate antiviral activity in the gut is unclear. Here we show two distinct subsets of NK cells exist in the gut, one localized to intraepithelial spaces (IEL) and the other to the lamina propria (LP). The frequency of both subsets of NK cells was reduced in chronic infection, whereas IEL NK cells remained stable in spontaneous controllers with protective KIR/HLA genotypes. Both IEL and LP NK cells were significantly expanded in immunologic non-responsive (INR) patients, who incompletely recovered CD4+ T cells on HAART. These data suggest that both IEL and LP NK cells may expand in the gut in an effort to compensate for compromised CD4+ T cell recovery, but that only IEL NK cells may be involved in providing durable control of HIV in the gut, Users may view, print, copy, and download text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use:",

Several lines of evidence suggest that HIV preferentially infects activated memory CD4+ T cells 4 , and therefore the gut, which harbors a large concentration of activated memory CD4+ T cells, provides fertile ground for rapid HIV infection and dissemination. As early as the first few weeks of HIV infection, significant physical and immunological changes occur in the gut, including a massive accumulation of CD8+ T lymphocytes 2,5,6 and a massive depletion of CD4+ T cells 7 . These dramatic changes in cell frequencies in the gut are accompanied by increased gut permeability resulting in microbial translocation, leading to elevated levels of microbial products in the blood such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) that has been shown to contribute to the induction of immune activation 8 .",

Given that HIV replicates robustly in the GI tract, it is likely that immune responses must work aggressively during acute infection in the gut to contain the ongoing dramatic viral replication. It is therefore plausible that these GI antiviral responses may represent the most robust control over the virus, and measurements of the immune response in the peripheral blood may not necessarily reflect responses in the gut.",

Several lines of evidence suggest that dramatic changes occur within the NK cell compartment during HIV infection, including phenotypic and functional changes [16] [17] [18] [19] that potentially contribute to the failure to control infection and progression to AIDS 20, 21 . However, NK cells in individuals expressing protective KIR/HLA genotypes expand rapidly in acute infection and exhibit strong antiviral activity against HIV in vitro 14 . Furthermore, recent studies from Vieillard et al. demonstrated that spontaneous HIV controllers exhibit robust NK cell responses 22 . Yet, given that the majority of HIV viral replication occurs in the gut, it is essential to define whether gut mucosal NK cells contribute to antiviral control at this vulnerable site of infection in these unique individuals that control HIV infection in the absence of therapy.",

In our studies, we identified two distinct populations of gut mucosal-resident NK cells, one present in the IEL (IEL NK) and the other in the lamina propria (LP NK). Interestingly, we observed changes in IEL and LP NK cell frequencies in HIV infection. Unexpectedly, increased frequencies of both IEL and LP NK cells were only observed in subjects with incomplete peripheral blood CD4+ T cell recovery (CD4<350 cells/ul) despite long-term antiretroviral therapy (ART)-mediated viral suppression. However importantly, spontaneous controllers expressing protective KIR/HLA genotypes had higher IEL NK cell numbers than those with non-protective genotypes, suggesting that IEL NK cells may contribute to durable control of HIV in these individuals. These data suggest that two subsets of NK cells exist in the human gastrointestinal tract, one in the IEL and one in the LP, one of which may be involved in durable control of HIV infection, and both that may expand at this vulnerable site in response to incomplete immune recovery following virologic suppression.",

While several reports suggest that NK cells can be detected in gut mucosa in animals [23] [24] [25] [26] [33] [34] [35] , less is known about NK cells in human gut. Thus to define the frequency of NK cells in the gut, as well as their distribution and localization, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to visualize and quantify these cells. Traditionally, NK cells are defined as CD3 neg CD56 pos/neg CD16 pos/neg , however this combination of markers is difficult to use in immunohistochemical staining, due to the fact that CD56 also stains neural tissue that is abundant in the GI tract. In contrast, specific family of receptors, the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), are thought to be exclusively expressed on NK cells 36 . Thus, NKp46, an NCR expressed on nearly all NK cells, was selected. Two NKp46 antibodies were used in the study to detect NK cells in human colon: polyclonal goat anti-human (GAH) NKp46 and monoclonal mouse anti-human (MAH) NKp46. Unexpectedly, these two antibodies labeled two distinct cell populations in the gut. The GAH NKp46 exclusively labeled cells located in intraepithelial spaces (IEL NK) (Fig.  1A, 1C) , whereas MAH NKp46 labeled lamina propria cells (LP NK) (Fig. 1B, 1D ). LP NK cells were located in basolateral part of mucosa and within gut submucosa. Neither of these antibodies labeled cells within lymphoid aggregates, suggesting that NK cells may be excluded from inductive sites in the gut (data not shown). Additionally, a subset of IEL NK cells ( Fig. 2A) , but not LP NK cells (Fig. 2B) , co-expressed CD57, a marker of terminal differentiation, present on NK cells and T cells 37 , suggesting that these two NK cell subsets represent phenotypically, and potentially functionally distinct cell types. Thus two populations of NK cells were identified in healthy human gut, located in distinct regions of the tissues, potentially reflecting unique functional characteristics.",

Furthermore, all three antibodies stained CD45 pos CD3 neg NKp46 pos cells that also coexpressed NKG2A, confirming that the stained mucosal cells belong to the NK cell lineage (Fig. 4B ).

We hypothesized that both of these NK cell subsets would expand preferentially in the controller group, potentially contributing to durable control of HIV infection, whereas we speculated that the frequency of these cells would be depressed in chronically infected individuals off therapy. As expected, we observed a trend towards a decrease in the frequency of both IEL and LP NK cells in chronic untreated patients with high viral loads (VL) as compared to HIV-subjects (Fig. 6A,  6B ). However, we observed a remarkably heterogeneous distribution of NK cells in controllers, marked by a wide distribution of both IEL and LP NK cell frequencies, with some individuals exhibiting some of the highest levels of both subsets of NK cells in their guts, whereas the vast majority exhibited some of the lowest frequencies of these cells. No difference was observed in either IEL or LP NK cell frequencies among elite compared to viremic controllers (Fig. 6C) . Conversely, the most dramatic expansion of both IEL and LP NK cells was observed in the treated patient group that exhibited incomplete or suboptimal CD4+ T cell recovery despite long-term anti-retroviral therapy, (immunological nonresponders (INR)) (ART INR:CHRO UNTX P<0.05 for both IEL and LP NK cells, Fig. 6A , 6B). LP NK cells in immunologic non-responders were also significantly more frequent compared to LP NK cells in spontaneous controllers (ART INR:CONTRL P<0.05). Interestingly, this expansion of IEL and LP NK cells in the INR patients was related (Fig.  6D) , and appeared to drive the IEL/LP NK cell correlation observed in Fig. 5D . These data suggest for the first time that NK cell distribution in the gut of controllers is quite heterogeneous, NK cell frequencies decline in chronic HIV infection, but that both IEL and LP NK cells expand in the GI tract of incompletely reconstituted HIV+ subjects on ART Sips et al.",

We therefore compared the frequency of NK cells to the VL, CD4 and CD8 count in the peripheral circulation. We found no correlation between VL and NK cells in any of the patient populations, potentially suggesting that the peripheral level of viremia may not drive these changes in NK cell frequencies, but that perhaps local viral replication could have an impact. However, a positive correlation between IEL NK cells and peripheral blood CD4+ T cells (R 2 =0.3322, P=0.0498) and a negative correlation between IEL NK and peripheral blood CD8+ T cells (R 2 =0.4071, P=0.0256) was observed in untreated, chronically infected patients (Fig. 6D) .

In our study we identified two populations of NK cells in the GI tract, one that resides in intraepithelial space of the crypts (IEL NK) and one present in the lamina propria (LP NK) of the colon tissue (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, we observed a remarkable heterogeneity in the distribution of IEL and LP NK cells in spontaneous controllers, where some of these patients expressed the highest frequencies of NK cells in the gut, but the majority exhibited reduced frequencies of these innate immune cells, similar to the levels observed in chronic HIV infection. Moreover, we observed that the frequency of both IEL and LP NK cells were expanded in HAART treated patients that did not fully reconstitute their CD4+ T cell numbers (Fig. 6A, 6B) . Additionally, IEL NK cells were preserved in spontaneous controllers with protective KIR/HLA genotypes compared to controllers with non-protective KIR/HLA genetic backgrounds. These data suggest for the first time that IEL NK cells may contribute to persistent durable control of viral replication in the gut in controllers with protective KIR/HLA compound genotypes, and that both IEL and LP NK cells expand at this vulnerable site in individuals that are incompletely able to recover from the assault of the virus, potentially in an effort to compensate for the persisting compromised environment within this barrier.",

Some recent data show that collagen deposition and disruption of the lymphatic tissue architecture contribute to persistent CD4+ T cell depletion prior to treatment, and the extent of these changes affects the efficiency of immune reconstitution after the initiation of therapy 41 . Such observations have been made at first in lymph nodes (LN) 41 and subsequently in gut-associated lymphatic tissue (GALT) 42 , the latter suffering from a more pronounced loss in CD4+ T cell numbers 3,43-45 . Furthermore, immunological nonresponders exhibit particular unique clinical characteristics including fibrosis in LNs and gut tissue, increased persistent immune activation, and elevated markers of chronic inflammation despite undetectable VLs 46 . Thus despite the direct-antiretroviral effects on reducing viral replication, these individuals still exhibit some markers of chronic disease. In addition to these markers of continued disease pathology, we report here that these individuals also exhibit a remarkable expansion of NK cells in the gut (Fig. 6A, 6B) . We speculate that incomplete immunological reconstitution causes some additional inflammatory stimuli in the gut, potentially due to some persistent low level viral replication, resulting in the persistent recruitment of innate immune cells to help provide some level of protection in the absence of CD4+ T cells. Thus mucosal NK cells may expand in an effort to compensate for the compromised gut mucosal immunity. Interestingly, this NK cell expansion is not observed in chronic untreated patients, despite the fact that they exhibit reduced CD4+ T cell numbers as well, however, these individuals also exhibit high levels of viral replication and persistent immune activation, due to microbial translocation 8 , through accessory cells 40 . This hyper-activation, however, may drive direct NK cell apoptosis 47 , thereby preventing the observed increase of these cytolytic effector cells within tissues.",

            "text": "Epidemiologic work strongly suggests that NK cells may be directly involved in antiviral control of HIV 10, 13, 14 . We therefore speculated that these innate effectors may expand preferentially in the gut of individuals that exhibit durable control of HIV, including the elite and viremic controllers. Overall controllers exhibited a heterogeneous distribution of both IEL and LP NK cells in mucosal sections ( Fig. 6A and B) , that did not differ in ECs or VCs (Fig. 6C) , and were similar in overall numbers from that seen in chronically infected individuals. However, given the strong epidemiologic data suggesting that specific KIR/HLA combinations contribute to spontaneous control of HIV infection, we examined IEL and LP NK cell distributions among controllers with protective and non-protective KIR/HLA genotypes. Interestingly, we observed a trend towards a elevated IEL, but not LP, NK cells in controllers with protective KIR/HLA genotypes, suggesting for the first time that particular NK cell populations may persist in these unique individuals at this vulnerable site, aimed at maintaining long-term control of HIV infection. The specific preservation of IEL, and not LP, NK cells may reflect functional differences between these subsets of lymphocytes. Previous work has suggested that lymphocytes able to traffic in the IEL exhibit more cytolytic functional properties than those found in the LP 48 . This may suggest that the elevated IEL NK cells in controllers with protective KIR/HLA genotypes may confer an enhanced capacity to rapidly deploy the cytolytic antiviral activity of NK cells, should the cell encounter a potential viral burst that have been suggested to occur in some controllers 49 . However, additional in depth functional studies are required to begin to dissect the functional and phenotypic properties of NK cells in these two compartments of the tissues, and particularly those that may expand in spontaneous control in the setting of protective KIR/HLA genotypes.",

            "text": "Early studies from animal models have shown IEL lymphocytes to have higher cytolytic activity than LP 48 or Peyer's patches lymphocytes 35 , however the specific distribution and functional properties of NK cells in the gut have been poorly explored. A population of cells, called NK-22, was reported to reside in the lamina propria of tonsils, lacking classical markers (including NKp46) of NK cells, but expressing NKp44 and secreting IL-22 required for the maintenance of epithelium integrity 31 . Yet, several lines of evidence now suggest that NK-22 cells belong to a subset of lymphoid-tissue inducer (LTi) cells, rather than conventional NK cells 32 . However, here we report the presence of two NK cell subsets, distinct from NK-22 as they express NKp46, that are distributed in distinct effector compartments of the gut. Based on their location within mucosa, we speculate that IEL NK cells may be more cytolytic and may serve as the first line of defense, just beneath the epithelial border, whereas LP NK cells, located in basolateral surface of gut mucosa and in submucosa may constitute an immunoregulatory type of NK subset, similar to that seen in the uterine tissues. These two NK cell subsets exhibit distinct phenotypes what supports this potential functional difference, as only IEL NK cells co-express the terminal differentiation marker CD57 (Fig. 2 ) that is expressed on more cytolytic blood NK cells 37 . The fact that these two NK cell populations were identified by two antibodies targeting the same antigen mounted in different species, suggests that the NKp46 receptor may exhibit conformational changes depending on the activation status of NK cells. A similar scenario has been observed for the CD43 molecule, where two distinct antibodies recognize differentially glycosylated isoforms of the receptor, reflecting distinct activation states of the lymphocytes on which they are expressed 50 . Given that NKp46 is highly glycosylated 51 , we speculate that these two antibodies may recognize NKp46 antigens with unique glycosylation patterns or conformational changes on IEL and LP NK cells, providing a useful mechanism by which to identify mucosal NK cell subpopulations.",

We show that the frequency of both subsets of NK cells change following HIV infection, with an overall loss of both subsets in chronic infection, but with a significant expansion in immunologic non-responders. Furthermore, we show that the protective KIR/HLA genotypes are associated with a preservation of IEL NK cells in spontaneous controllers. These data suggest that while chronic HIV infection is associated with reduced frequencies of these innate effector cells in the gut, these cells respond robustly and expand in the setting of incomplete immune reconstitution potentially aimed at compensating for incomplete immunological recovery in patients on HAART and in spontaneous controllers with protective KIR/HLA genotypes what may provide durable protection from infection following acute infection.",
