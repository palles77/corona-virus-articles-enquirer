            "text": "Many pathogens take advantage of the dependence of the host on the interaction of hundreds of extracellular proteins with the glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate to regulate homeostasis and use heparan sulfate as a means to adhere and gain access to cells. Moreover, mucosal epithelia such as that of the respiratory tract are protected by a layer of mucin polysaccharides, which are usually sulfated. Consequently, the polydisperse, natural products of heparan sulfate and the allied polysaccharide, heparin have been found to be involved and prevent infection by a range of viruses including S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1. Here we use surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism to measure the interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 protein receptor binding domain (SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD) and heparin. The data demonstrate an interaction between the recombinant surface receptor binding domain and the polysaccharide. This has implications for the rapid development of a first-line therapeutic by repurposing heparin and for next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antivirals.",

Secondary structural prediction was calculated through the BeStSel analysis server 10 .To ensure the CD spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence of heparin was not altered owing to the addition of the heparin alone, which is known to possess CD spectra at high concentrations 11,12 a differential spectrum was analysed. The theoretical, summative CD spectra was confirmed to differ from the observed experimental CD spectra, thereby indicating that the change in the CD spectra compared to that of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD alone is a result of a conformational change upon binding to porcine mucosal heparin (Leo Pharma, UK).",

This is demonstrated by the injection of 65 nM solution over the control channel, functionalized with just streptavidin, where there was a decrease in response, followed by a return to baseline when the channel was returned to running buffer (Fig. 1C, between red arrows) .
