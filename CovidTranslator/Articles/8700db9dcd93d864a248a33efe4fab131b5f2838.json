            "text": "RNA interference is a promising strategy for treatment of Huntington's disease (HD) as it can specifically decrease the expression of the mutant Huntingtin protein (Htt). However, siRNA does not cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore delivery to the brain is limited to direct CNS delivery. Non-invasive delivery of siRNA through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) would be a significant advantage for translating this therapy to HD patients. Focused ultrasound (FUS), combined with intravascular delivery of microbubble contrast agent, was used to locally and transiently disrupt the BBB in the right striatum of adult rats. 48 hrs following treatment with siRNA, the right (treated) and left (control) striatum was dissected and analyzed for Htt mRNA levels. We demonstrate that FUS can non-invasively deliver siRNA-Htt directly to the striatum leading to a significant reduction of Htt expression in a dose dependent manner. Furthermore, we show that reduction of Htt with siRNA-Htt was greater when the extent of BBB disruption was increased. This study demonstrates that siRNA treatment for knockdown of mutant Htt is feasible without the surgical intervention previously required for direct delivery to the brain.",

Advances in FUS technology have been used to transiently increase the permeability of the BBB, allowing agents to cross from the blood stream to the brain [11] . FUS applies concentrated acoustic energy to a focal spot measuring a few millimeters in diameter. A microbubble contrast agent is administered systemically and when FUS is applied transcranially to the target location, the circulating microbubbles begin to oscillate. This leads to mechanical changes in the blood vessel wall and a transient increase in the permeability of the BBB [11] . Previous work has shown that transient changes in BBB permeability induced by FUS, permits entry of chemotherapeutics and therapeutic antibodies to targeted areas of the brain [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

It is typical for siRNA to only partially reduce the expression of endogenous neural targets, sometimes by as little as 10-20%. However, modest reductions in Htt mRNA have been shown to provide therapeutic benefit in animal models of Huntington's disease. From RNAi studies reported to-date using direct viral delivery of shRNA to the CNS in animal models of Huntington's disease, Htt mRNA suppression of approximately 45% or greater has resulted in meaningful normalization of neuropathology and behavior [4] .

            "text": "We did not observe a dose-dependent relationship between cc-siRNA-Htt concentration and reduction in Htt DNA beyond 25 mg/kg. This may be attributable to two different mechanisms. First, the nature of BBB disruption with MRIgFUS is transient [11, 20] ; thus, it is possible that the BBB repairs itself quickly, before enough siRNA can enter the brain. Our results showed that the extent of Htt knockdown was related to the amount of BBB disruption, suggesting that significant BBB disruption is required for cc-siRNA to enter the striatum. However, in similar studies, increased BBB permeability persisted for 6-24 hours [20, 21] and the half-life of cc-siRNA in circulation is expanded to ~95 min [6] suggesting adequate time for the siRNA to cross into the brain. Second, it is possible that this limitation is due to the molecular target and the ability to silence it completely. Regardless of the mechanism, the apparent limitation of a ~30% reduction of Htt may actually be ideal for treatment in the clinical setting. The optimal siRNA for treatment of HD would specifically target the mutant form of Htt but this has proved to be challenging. Recent results suggest that specificity for mutant Htt over wild-type Htt can be achieved in vitro [22, 23] , though with relatively high (nanomolar) concentrations, in contrast to the picomolar potencies typically achieved with siRNAs in vitro. For this reason, our group and others have generated siRNA which result in decreased expression of both the mutant and the wildtype forms of Htt. The suppression of mutant Htt would have to be finely balanced with the suppression of wildtype Htt which is known to be important for neuronal development and survival [24, 25] . Based on previous literature, we hypothesize that a 30% reduction in wildtype Htt as shown in our experiments would be well tolerated in the long term [26, 27] ; however, further investigations would be necessary to ensure the treatment would be suitable for clinical application.",

However, we did find a correlation between the amount of contrast enhancement on post-treatment images and Htt knockdown suggesting that the success of the siRNA was directly related to how much BBB disruption was achieved. Several routes of passage through the BBB have been described [28, 29] . It is likely that the cc-siRNA moves paracellularly, through the widened tight junctions, into the brain, however, passage via transcellular mechanisms which peak approximately 1 hr after sonication [30] , is also possible due to the extended half-life of the cc-siRNA [6] .",

            "text": "Using MRIgFUS, we have demonstrated that we can deliver siRNA to the small region of the striatum. Our mRNA analysis clearly demonstrates that sufficient quantities of siRNA can be delivered to the brain and that FUS itself does not impact the function of the siRNA. In future, combination of the cc-siRNA-Htt with the microbubbles may improve drug availability in the tissue similar to previous studies [34, 35] . BBB disruption with FUS has repeatedly been shown to occur with no or only minor red blood cell extravasation [34, 35] and without impacting the efficacy of the delivered drug [15, 36] . Secondly, the effects of siRNA in vivo can persist for as long as 2-4 weeks [18] ; however, treatment for HD will require intervention over many years. MRIgFUS provides a unique treatment option in this regard as the therapy is non-invasive and can be repeated safely multiple times [37] .",

The extent to which immunological pathways are activated is dependent upon the sequence, structure and quality of the siRNA. The 2\u2032-O-methyl modifications, as used in the siRNA here, have been demonstrated to eliminate immune stimulation of siRNA's as a class, without compromising silencing activity [18] . Using siRNA with similar chemical modifications, DiFiglia and colleagues [7] evaluated reactive microglia and astrocytes and determined that there was no measurable inflammatory response following injection of siRNA into the striatum. Future studies will focus on a comprehensive analysis of CNS immunostimulation after siRNA administration using MRIgFUS. Nonetheless, the current study suggests that siRNA administration using MRIgFUS represents a promising therapeutic approach that warrants further investigation for the treatment of CNS disorders such as HD.",
