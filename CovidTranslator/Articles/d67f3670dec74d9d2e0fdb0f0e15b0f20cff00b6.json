The terminal glucose and mannose residues are immediately removed after the transfer of the oligosaccharide onto newly synthesized polypeptides. This processing determines whether the polypeptide will be retained in the ER, transported along the secretory pathway, or dislocated across the ER membrane for destruction. Recently, new avenues of research and some issues of controversy have been opened by the discovery that lectinoligosaccharide interactions stabilize supramolecular complexes between regulators of ERassociated degradation (ERAD). In this Opinion, we propose a unified model that depicts carbohydrates acting both as flags signaling the fitness of a maturing protein, and as docking sites that regulate assembly and stability of the ERAD machinery.",

These complexes play crucial roles in inspecting the content of the ER lumen to aid in the clearance of defective gene products, orphan subunits of oligomeric complexes, and metabolically-regulated proteins.

Malectin, a Glc 2 -binding protein, might then intervene to retain immature and/or misfolded polypeptides in the ER 8, 9 . Removal of the glucose m by the \u03b1-glucosidase II, a luminal heterodimeric enzyme, supports co-or post-translational association of folding polypeptides with the ER lectins calnexin and calreticulin 2, 7 . The oxidoreductase ERp57 and the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase cyclophilin B are associated with calnexin and calreticulin, and they catalyze rate-limiting folding reactions to facilitate attainment of the native structure 10, 11 . Removal of the innermost glucose residue l by \u03b1-glucosidase II dissociates the polypeptide from the calnexin/ calreticulin chaperone system. At this stage, UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) inspects the structure of the released proteins. Non-native polypeptides are reglucosylated by UGT1, initiating rebinding to the lectin chaperones and their associated folding factors. Native polypeptides are not recognized by UGT1 and are secreted 12 .

As in budding yeast, the ER mannosidase I (Mns1p orthologue) catalyses removal of the mannose residue i. If misfolding persists, N-linked glycans are further processed by EDEM1 and EDEM3 (ERdegradation enhancing mannosidase-like proteins and Htm1p/Htm2p orthologues) or by another resident \u03b11,2 mannosidase ( Figure 2 , steps 1 and 2, respectively). Demonstration of mannosidase activity with purified EDEM1 and EDEM3 is still lacking, and the role of a third EDEM variant, EDEM2, in ERAD is even less characterized [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . It should therefore be considered that proteins of the EDEM family could operate as mannose-binding lectins associating with de-mannosylated oligosaccharides generated by extensive processing in a sub-region of the ER that is populated with high ER mannosidase I concentrations (i.e. the ER quality control compartment or ERQC, discussed in 3, 5 ).",

Removal of mannose k exposes the \u03b11,6-linked mannose j, thereby recruiting the ERAD MRH-containing lectins OS-9 and XTP3-B, which are expressed in several splice variants in the mammalian ER [27] [28] [29] [30] (Figure 2 , steps 2-6).",

Christianson et al. used this approach to confirm that a prominent interactor of the type I membrane protein SEL1L is the membraneembedded E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1 27 . These studies also revealed an association of SEL1L with the luminal MRH-containing proteins OS-9 and XTP3-B. Additional studies have discovered that the mannosidase-like domain-containing proteins EDEM1 and EDEM3 also interact with SEL1L 24, 35, 37 . Disruption of the EDEM1, EDEM3, OS-9 or XTP3-B oligosaccharide-binding motifs, or cell treatment with kifunensine (an inhibitor of demannosylation of protein bound oligosaccharides), decreases the association of these ERAD factors with the penta-glycosylated protein SEL1L 24, 27, 29, 30, 34, 35, 41, 42 . Altogether, these data reveal that EDEM1, EDEM3, OS-9 and XTP3-B activity is not restricted to oligosaccharides displayed on folding-defective polypeptides as described in the mannose timer model of glycoprotein quality control (Figure 2, routes A and B) . Rather, these luminal ERAD factors might also engage SEL1L oligosaccharides to dock at the HRD1 dislocation complex (Figure 2 , routes C and D; docking model). This facilitates delivery of ERAD substrates to dislocation sites and their transport across the ER membrane for their eventual proteasomal degradation. Several reports also reveal oligosaccharide-independent association of EDEM proteins, OS-9 and XTP3-B with misfolded proteins 22, 24, 25, 27-29, 33, 43, 44 (Figure 2 , routes C and D) or with SEL1L 36 (Figure 2 , routes A and B).

Misregulated ERAD might select on-pathway folding intermediates for degradation before they are given a sufficient opportunity to reach their native structure ( 45 and references therein). For example, aberrantly high levels of the ER E3 ligases HRD1 and gp78 cause the inappropriate degradation of individual gene products and are associated with rheumatoid arthritis and highly metastatic sarcoma, respectively 46, 47 . The concept of ERAD tuning 45 is based on emerging evidences showing that a growing number of ERAD factors, including ER mannosidase I, HERP, gp78, JAMP, EDEM1, OS-9, and SEL1L, are constitutively removed from the unstressed ER 37, 48-54 . Luminal expression of misfolded proteins might inactivate the constitutive removal of select ERAD factors from the ER and stabilize complexes between ERAD regulatory components. This might enhance ERAD in the absence of unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. This implies the existence of ERAD substrate-dependent feedback mechanisms that rapidly adapt ERAD activity to the misfolded protein load 37 .",

However, in the absence of ERAD substrates, the ERAD tuning pathways are activated. SEL1L is disengaged from inactive dislocons. Under these circumstances, the cytosolic tail of SEL1L (or a SEL1L-associated protein) recruits the ubiquitin-like protein LC3-I to build a membrane-bound receptor that regulates the selective and constitutive clearance of SEL1L-associated OS-9 and EDEM1 from the unstressed ER (Figure 3) 37 . These receptor:ligand complexes enter so called ERAD tuning vesicles, which lack a coatomer coat and are larger than the COPII vesicles that ferry cargo proteins from the ER to the Golgi 37, 48, 49, 55 . ERAD tuning vesicles contain up to 80% of the cellular EDEM1 in unstressed cells 33, 48, 55 , but much less in cells expressing ERAD substrates, which substantially inhibit the removal of ERAD factors from the ER 37 . They eventually deliver OS-9, EDEM1, the short-living ER mannosidase I, and possibly other SEL1Linteracting ERAD factors such as XTP3-B and EDEM3 to an ill-defined endo-lysosomal degradative organelle. In summary, the presence or absence of misfolded polypeptides might determine whether the lectin-glycan association with SEL1L drives ERAD substrate progression downstream through the ERAD pathway or directs the removal of ERAD lectins from the ER.",

The glycosidases and glycosyltransferases that process protein-bound oligosaccharides, the lectins engaged by the different oligosaccharide structures, and the role of each trimming intermediate in protein quality control have been characterized. In this Opinion, we propose a new unified model for the role of glycans in protein quality control that combines components of the mannose timer and docking models. The mannose timer model shows how N-linked glycans can act as flags that signal terminally misfolded polypeptides to be degraded by recruiting ERAD lectins. N-linked glycans can also support lectin-oligosaccharides interactions between components of the ERAD machinery as demonstrated in the docking model 24, 27, [34] [35] [36] [37] . These associations drive progression of substrates along the ERAD pathway or promote removal of ERAD factors from the ER lumen for ERAD tuning in the absence of misfolded polypeptides. Upon accumulation of terminally misfolded polypeptides and under stress conditions where the UPR is activated, the formation and the stability of active dislocation machineries would be favored to ensure the rapid turnover of aberrant cargo. This implies a model of Nglycoprotein processing in the ER that includes the regulatory tuning of ERAD components by a substrate-dependent feedback mechanism. A substrate-dependent feedback mechanism has been proposed in yeast, where the activity of the EDEM1 orthologue Htm1p is enhanced upon misfolded polypeptide-induced formation of a functional complex between the mannosidase and Pdi1p 17 .",

It will be important to determine the quaternary structure of the ERAD lectin complexes. If organized in oligomers, the presence of multiple glycan binding sites would support the recognition of oligosaccharide flags on misfolded polypeptides and of docking oligosaccharides on the dislocation machinery at the ER membrane by individual ERAD lectin complexes. The resolution of this issue and other open questions (Box 1) might aid in the design of approaches that will support the intervention in protein misfolding diseases or help optimize the production of ectopic proteins used in clinics or industry.",

The glycan attached to an ERAD substrate (black sinuous line) is trimmed of a mannose residue by ER mannosidase I (ER Man I, step 1). This is followed by EDEM1 recognition. EDEM1 is present in a complex with ERdj5 and BiP. In the mannose timer model, EDEM1 acts as a mannosidase to trim additional mannose residues (step 2). (A) ERAD substrates are directly recognized by SEL1L (step 3). OS-9/XTP3-B associate with SEL1L to act as ERAD gatekeepers by querying the ERAD substrate for exposed \u03b11,6-linked mannose residues. If the protein possesses the proper glycans, it is passed along the ERAD pathway (step 4). (B) Alternatively, trimmed ERAD substrates are recognized by OS-9/XTP3-B (step 5) and delivered to the ERAD membrane complex (step 6). (C) and (D) depict glycan docking models for OS-9/XTP3-B and EDEM1, respectively. For C, OS-9/XTP3-B recognize the misfolded substrates through protein-protein interactions (step 7). This can involve associated co-factors such as GRP94. OS-9-XTP3-B then deliver the ERAD substrate to the ER membrane ERAD complex by binding to the glycans on the adapter SEL1L (step 8) or on a glycosylated SEL1L associated protein. For D, the EDEM1 complex associates with ERAD substrates (step 9). EDEM1 employs its mannosidase-like domain to deliver the The receptor-mediated removal of EDEM1 and OS-9 from the ER lumen is shown. In the absence of misfolded proteins, SEL1L is disengaged from the HRD1 dislocation machinery. The penta-glycosylated ectodomain of SEL1L associates with EDEM1 and OS-9 (step 1). The cytosolic tail of SEL1L or a SEL1L-associated protein binds the cytosolic ubiquitin-like protein LC3-I. The complex is released from the ER in vesicles (steps 3 and 4) that may eventually fuse with an ill-defined degradative compartment. ERAD tuning vesicles are coopted by coronaviruses as replication and transcription platform vesicles.",
