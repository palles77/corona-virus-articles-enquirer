Secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (SLPI), elafin and WFDC1/ps20 are three members of this WAP family, characterized by the presence of a fourdisulfide core (FDC) structure (Bingle and Vyakarnam, 2008; Bouchard et al., 2006; Hennighausen and Sippel, 1982a, b; Piletz et al., 1981; Simpson et al., 2000; Simpson and Nicholas, 2002) . SLPI and elafin exhibit antiviral activity that is not associated with their anti-protease function (Bingle and Vyakarnam, 2008; Ma et al., 2004; McNeely et al., 1995) : SLPI inhibits human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of primary monocytes by binding to annexin II (Bingle et al., 2001; Doumas et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2004) and elafin exerts its antiviral activity by direct binding to HIV (Ghosh et al., 2009) . Unlike elafin and SLPI, ps20 is a permissivity factor for HIV infection (Alvarez et al., 2007) . ps20, encoded by the WFDC1 gene on human chromosome 16, is ubiquitously expressed at sites of potential pathogen infection, including memory CD4+ T cells, likely contributing to HIV adaptation to exploit ps20 as a permissivity factor by upregulating a key cell-surface adhesion molecule, CD54 (Alvarez et al., 2007; Larsen et al., 2000) . The interaction of CD54 with LFA-1 is known to stabilize HIV-1 fusion to targets cells, thereby promoting HIV entry. Thus, in contrast to SLPI and elafin, ps20 functions to enhance viral infectivity, at least for HIV.",

            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus type 1 (MHV-1) is a member of the Coronaviridae family of positive single-stranded RNA viruses. MHV-1 infects a wide variety of species, including humans, rodents, felines and birds (Gu and Korteweg, 2007; Spaan et al., 1988) . MHV-1 is a mouse-specific coronavirus (Spaan et al., 1988) . MHV strains enter host cells via endocytosis mediated by a virion spike protein binding to host carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1(CEACAM-1a) (Compton et al., 1992; Perlman and Netland, 2009 ). In an earlier report we described a mouse model of respiratory MHV-1 infection, wherein A/J mice are more susceptible to intranasal respiratory MHV-1 infection than C57Bl/6 mice, associated with differences in the host innate immune response, specifically the interferon (IFN) response (Albuquerque et al., 2006; Baig and Fish, 2008) . Subsequent publications have confirmed that variable sensitivity to MHV-1 infection is a consequence of the innate and adaptive immune responses (Khanolkar et al., 2009a) and that MHV infection inhibits IFN production (Zhou and Perlman, 2007) . Notably, MHV-1-specific T and B cell responses exert protective effects that minimize morbidity in C57Bl/6 mice (Khanolkar et al., 2009a) . Given the contribution of innate and adaptive immune responses to morbidity in MHV-1 infection of C57Bl/6 mice and the accumulating data that WAP proteins influence susceptibility to infection, employing ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 C57Bl/6 mice we examined the effects of ps20 on the immune response to MHV-1 infection. Our data reveal a hitherto unreported contribution of neutrophils to MHV-1 infection and describe how ps20 expression affects both neutrophil migration to MHV-1 infected lungs and draining lymph nodes (dLNs) and neutrophil susceptibility to infection, associated with effects on lung virus replication.",

These mice were generated through replacement of exon 1 of the WFDC1 gene with a LacZ gene at the WFDC1 ATG start codon. The LacZ-PGK-neo cassette introduced an EcoRV site, which was used for screening by Southern analysis. To confirm deletion of WFDC1 and insertion of LacZ, genomic DNA was digested with EcoRV and probed with a Spe1-Apa 1.3 kb probe. The ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 allele is 6.5 kb, and the ps20 +/+ allele is 9.5 kb. The screened ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 gene constructs were inserted into a 129 mouse blastocyte by electroporation and subsequently implanted into a C57Bl/6 ps20 +/+ female host. Pups were subsequently backcrossed to a C57Bl/6 background using a speed congenic approach. Briefly, low-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis (The Center for Applied Genomics, Toronto, ON) was performed on tail-snip DNA from the pups of each progeny litter. Mice exhibiting the highest SNP homology to C57Bl/6 were selected for subsequent breeding. Screening was completed until mice were >98% homologous to C57Bl/6 mice. A/ J and C57Bl/6 mice, aged 6-8 weeks were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were bred and housed in a pathogen-free environment and all experiments were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Toronto General Research Institute.",

Skin fibroblasts from ps20 +/+ mice exhibit gene expression for ps20 (data not shown). In a first series of experiments we provide evidence that fibroblasts derived from ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice are more sensitive to MHV-1 infection than fibroblasts from ps20 +/+ mice ( Fig. 2A) . Notably, MHV-1 infection of both ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 fibroblasts does not result in a cytopathic effect or induce apoptosis by 24 h post-infection, hence viral prog-eny were measured in culture medium following infection of cells, using the L2 plaque assay as described (Section 2.5). To confirm that this outcome was a direct consequence of ps20 expression levels, we next examined the effects of treatment of ps20 +/+ fibroblasts with neutralizing antibodies to ps20, namely the anti-ps20 FAb IG7, on MHV-1 infection. Following a 1 h pre-treatment with IG7, ps20 +/+ fibroblasts were infected with MHV-1 at an MOI of 0.01 for 16 h. ps20 +/+ fibroblasts treated with IG7 exhibited higher viral titers compared with ps20 +/+ fibroblasts treated with either a control FAb or PBS (PBS mock-treated control $12.75 PFU/mL; control IgG $16.7 PFU/mL; IG7 $535.4 PFU/mL) (Fig. 2B) .",

Female C57Bl/6 ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice aged 6-8 weeks were euthanized and their LNs, spleen and BM were harvested and processed for FACS analysis. PB was harvested by cardiac puncture. Cells were isolated as described in Section 2.3 and stained with appropriate antibodies for specific immune cell markers. (A) Representative plots of cells stained for GR1 derived from the PB of ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were generated based on isotype matched control antibodies. Lineage specific markers for different leukocyte populations were analyzed by FACS analysis, staining with antibodies specific for the indicated surface markers in the (B) PB, (C) spleen, (D) LN, (E) BM.

IFN-b gene expression is induced to comparable levels (Fig. 3A ). Next we examined the gene expression levels for CXCL1 and CXCL2, chemokines with neutrophil chemoattractant activity. CXCL1 and CXCL2 gene expression levels are detectable post-infection in both the ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 and ps20 +/+ fibroblasts, with greater CXCL1 and CXCL2 gene expression in the ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 fibroblasts (Fig. 3A) . In a more extensive time course study we observe that following MHV-1 infection CXCL2 gene expression is downregulated in ps20 +/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 3B) . Notably, in the absence of ps20, basal levels of CXCL2 are higher in the ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 fibroblasts and, following MHV-1 infection, although there is some downregulation in CXCL2 expression, by 24 h levels are elevated again and comparable to uninfected cells, in stark contrast to the ps20 sufficient fibroblasts (Fig. 3B) . The implications are that ps20 may directly or indirectly regulate CXCL2 expression.",

Culture medium harvested from ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 fibroblasts treated with IFN-a4 and then infected with MHV-1 at an MOI of 0.01 for 16 h is less cytopathic in L2 cells compared with medium from MHV-1 infected and untreated ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 cells (Fig. 3C) .

Consistent with what we observed in vitro, ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice are more susceptible to MHV-1 infection than ps20 +/+ mice (Fig. 4A) .

In the absence of experimental data that show the effects of different lung viral titers on IFN induction, we infer that the viral burden in the lungs of both ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 and ps20 +/+ mice is such that IFN induction is comparable.

In dose-response experiments we examined the ability of recombinant ps20 protein, when incubated with human neutrophil elastase, to affect the elastase cleavage of the substrate N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val p-nitroanilide. Neutrophil elastase cleaves the substrate on the carboxyl side of valine and this cleavage results in the liberation of p-nitroanilide (Hagio et al., 2001; Simpson et al., 2001) . Whereas 10 lg/mL of elafin effectively inhibited neutrophil elastase activity by greater than 98%, up to 100 lg/mL of ps20 had no effect (Fig. 7A) .",

Neutrophils were isolated from the BM of ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and cell surface expression of CEACAM-1, the receptor for MHV-1, was determined by FACS. The data in Fig. 8A identify cell surface expression of CEACAM-1 in both ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 neutrophils, at comparable levels. The implications are that MHV-1 will infect neutrophils. Accordingly, we examined the infectivity of BM derived neutrophils from ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and provide evi-dence that both are susceptible to MHV-1 infection, yet the absence of ps20 is associated with greater infectivity (Fig. 8B) . Neutrophils are generally associated with clearance of infectious pathogens, mediated by their TLR activation and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) (Clark et al., 2007; Gonzalez-Dosal et al., 2011) . Notably, exposure of both ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 BM derived neutrophils to MHV-1 did not result in intracellular ROS generation and neutrophils from ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice have lower levels of intracellular ROS even in the absence of infection (Fig. 8C) . Immunohistology of lungs from ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice infected with MHV-1 did not reveal NET formation at 48 h post-infection, despite evidence of extensive neutrophil lung infiltration (Fig. 9) .",

We show that BM derived neutrophils from ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice express cell surface CEACAM-1 to similar levels and are indeed readily infected by MHV-1. We provide evidence that the ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 neutrophils are more susceptible to MHV-1 infection than the ps20 +/+ neutrophils. In addition, we observe that exposure of neutrophils to MHV-1 did not result in the generation of ROS that are associated with the anti-microbial activity of neutrophils. Moreover, in contrast to published data that describe a role for neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) contributing to acute lung injury in influenza pneumotitis (Narasaraju et al., 2011) , extensive examination of infected lung tissue did not show NETs (Fig. 9) .",

Since neutrophil elastase activity facilitates the migration of neutrophils into inflamed tissue (Wang et al., 2005; Young et al., 2007) , we speculated that ps20 may inhibit elastase activity, resembling elafin and SLPI, and that this inhibitory activity might decreased neutrophil migration into the lungs of ps20 +/+ mice compared with ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. However, in vitro examination of ps20 effects on neutrophil elastase activity revealed no inhibition. Close examination of the signature amino acid sequence conserved in SLPI and elafin that is thought to be associated with neutrophil elastase activity, reveals that it is not conserved in ps20 (Bingle and Vyakarnam, 2008) . Accordingly, the difference observed in neutrophil migration between ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice during MHV-1 infection likely is not a consequence of ps20 effects on neutrophil elastase activity.",

CXCL1 and CXCL2 promote neutrophil migration and cell adhesion, by invoking the modification of several integrins (Seo et al., 2001) . Examination of gene expression levels for these chemokines in the ps20 +/+ and ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 fibroblasts following MHV-1 infection revealed greater CXCL1 and CXCL2 expression in the ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 fibroblasts. Furthermore, in vivo, we observe elevated gene expression levels of both CXCL1 and CXCL2 in the lungs of ps20 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice in comparison to ps20 +/+ mice on day 1 post-infection with MHV-1. These findings implicate ps20 as a potential regulatory factor that limits the expression of neutrophil specific chemotactic factors, CXCL1 and CXCL2.",

For HIV, accumulating data suggest that ps20 influences T cell responses to infection, promoting infection. For MHV-1, our data describe a role for ps20 in limiting neutrophil accumulation in affected lungs, thereby providing protection from infection. Given the profoundly different consequences associated with ps20 expression in HIV and MHV-1 infections, our ongoing studies are directed towards elaborating the spectrum of activity of ps20 in the regulation of immune cell activation and trafficking. The intent is to consider this regulation in the context of specific virus infections that are regarded as a global health threat, and to develop strategies that invoke targeting ps20 for therapeutic intervention where relevant.",
