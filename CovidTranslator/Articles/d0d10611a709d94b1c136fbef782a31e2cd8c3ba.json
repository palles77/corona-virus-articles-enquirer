Here we describe a fluorescencemonitored, nested PCR assay that is able to quantify the relatively rare integration events that occur within these cells. Following DNA extraction, a nonkinetic preamplification step is performed with primers that bind genomic Alu elements and HIV-1 gag sequences, under conditions where primers, deoxynucleoside triphosphates, and enzyme are not limiting. This is followed by a kinetic PCR that quantitates HIV-1 long terminal repeat sequences. A T-cell-based integration standard which reflects the randomness of HIV-1 integration is also described. The assay is 10 to 100 times more sensitive than previously reported quantitative Alu PCRbased integration assays. It is specific for integration events, since no proviruses are detected in cells infected either in the presence of an integrase inhibitor or with an integrase-deficient virus. This method promises to provide important new insights into the processes underlying the accumulation and persistence of latent HIV-1 reservoirs and may eventually be useful clinically in monitoring the eradication of latent virus by novel therapies.",

Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) proviruses appear to contribute to viral persistence. This is most evident in treated patients, where the proviral load seems to be unaffected by combination antiretroviral therapy that clears viremia (10) . To date, proviral DNA has proven impossible to eradicate without death of the transduced host cell. These results suggest that provirus may serve as a treatment-resistant reservoir of HIV-1. Quantitative studies of this reservoir are challenging because of the relative rarity of integration events in quiescent leukocytes. Assays for HIV-1 integration have been implemented using three main strategies, namely, inverse PCR (7), linker-primer PCR (37) , and Alu PCR (2, 3, 5, 12, 34) . We focus on and refine the latter method here.",

In particular, most of these studies used genomic DNA prepared from graded doses of persistently infected cell lines such as 8E5 (34) , U1 (10), ACH-2 (10, 29) , or mixtures of such lines (37) as their standards. The problem with these cell lines is that they are clonal and contain one (19) , two (18) , or two (11) nonrandom HIV-1 integration sites, respectively. Standards prepared from these lines are likely to under-or overestimate the number of integration events in nearly all types of unknowns, since the proviruses these cell lines harbor are integrated at specific, nonvariable distances from the Alu repeats within their genomes. Single integration events can be detected in these clonal DNA standards, presumably arising from integration sites relatively close to the nearest Alu element. However, in assigning numbers to these signals, an implicit assumption must be made that all integration events in the unknowns must also be detectable by PCR (7) . Due to the random nature of both HIV-1 integration and Alu retroposition, each Alu-gag integration site in a nonclonal collection of infected cells will be amplified with a different efficiency. It is likely that significant (and unknown) numbers of proviruses are inserted too far away from an Alu site to be efficiently amplified. A corollary to this assertion is that the frequencies of integration within resting CD4 \u03e9 T cells that were previously determined using clonal PCR standards are likely to have been underestimated.",

The importance of appropriate standardization was emphasized, in particular the need for a standard that accurately reflected the random nature of integration. An integration standard was generated by infection of 293T cells with a high titer of virus, followed by a culture period of at least 30 days, to allow unintegrated forms of HIV-1 DNA to be eliminated (1, 16, 30) .

Accordingly, a nested PCR strategy was implemented, using conditions where deoxynucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs), primers, and enzyme were not limiting in the nonkinetic preamplification of Alu-gag sequences. The preamplification is followed by a real-time PCR assay that quantitates HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences using molecular beacon detection (36) . In parallel, we developed an alternative integration standard (IS) cell line, wherein a large number of target T cells were infected with a high-titer, randomly integrated, replication-incompetent HIV-1 construct containing an antibiotic resistance cassette. Prolonged antibiotic selection was performed prior to preparation of genomic DNA from these IS cells. The latter step ensured that every cell in this population contained at least one provirus, and that all of the HIV-1 DNA within these cells was integrated. The large number of targets initially infected insured that these integration events were numerous, occurring at a large range of distances from genomic Alu elements.",

These numbers were then assigned to the Alu-gag signals arising from a matching dilution series of preamplified IS (Fig. 4B) . The first PCR serves as a preamplification of Alu-gag signals, reducing the threshold cycle number of preamplified IS in the kinetic PCR. This shifted the IS curves to the left in Fig. 4B by about 12 cycles, corresponding to roughly 4 logs of amplification. Observed amplification factors (average of 6 performed within one assay) are listed in Table 1 . In this particular assay, as few as 5 proviruses in a 50-l sample were detectable. Since each sample can contain up to 50,000 cells, 1 provirus in 10,000 cells could be reliably measured in this run. This sensitivity should be sufficient to measure integration in primary lymphocytes (7, 29) . The relative uncertainty increases with increasing dilution, likely due to accumulated sampling errors. Within a run, the assay is very reproducible: duplicate reactions on the same plate containing the same master mix typically overlay each other closely (Fig. 4B) . Compared to the ACH-2 standard (Fig.  3A) , the dynamic range of the preamplified IS is relatively narrow, usually about 2.5 logs. These limits are attributable to the sigmoidal amplification characteristics of the nonkinetic preamplification step (13, 32) . Within this range, however, the standard curve is very linear (Fig. 4C) .

This construct lacks an Alu repeat, so when either the gag primer alone or the Alu-gag primer pair was used in the preamplification, similar signals were obtained, corresponding to roughly a fivefold amplification. As expected, when the Alu primer was used alone in the preamplification of pIIIB, a signal was obtained which was comparable to that of a nonpreamplified plasmid sample. Signals corresponding to up to 10 4 copies of unintegrated DNA can be tolerated by this assay, since they appear at higher threshold cycle numbers than the most dilute of the IS-derived preamplified standard curves. The sensitivity of the assay was further examined by performing one-way and bidirectional preamplifications of the IS, a heterogeneous template that contains exclusively integrated DNA (Fig. 5B) . Again, one-way amplification contributed a low-level interfering signal corresponding to about fivefold amplification over the nonpreamplified standard. In contrast, bidirectional Alu-gag preamplification resulted in a 4 log net amplification (approximately a 12-cycle reduction in threshold cycle number). Taken together, these findings indicate that the interfering signal from one-way amplification is small and can be subtracted from the total signal obtained from any given sample. Accounting for this signal becomes important at early time points following acute in vitro HIV-1 infection, when proviruses comprise only a minority of the total HIV-1 DNA present.",

It is now well established that a major inefficiency exists in reverse transcription in these cells (4, 24, 35, 38, 39) . A paucity of substrates for reverse transcriptase is in part responsible for this block, since the inefficiency can be partially overcome by supplementing the resting cells with exogenous deoxyribonucleosides (23) . Yet additional inefficiencies must exist downstream of reverse transcription, FIG. 5 . Sensitivity and specificity of the assay. (A) The plasmid pIIIB contains a full-length molecular clone of HIV-1 IIIB and no human DNA (in particular, no Alu sequences). One-way preamplification with the Alu primer alone (orange) produces a kinetic PCR signal comparable to the signal from a matched dose of nonpreamplified plasmid (green). Signals roughly fivefold higher arise from either one-way preamplification with the gag primer alone (black) or bidirectional preamplification with both Alu and gag primers. (B) One-way preamplification of the IS using either the Alu primer alone (orange) or the gag primer alone (black) produces roughly a fivefold amplification relative to a matched sample of nonpreamplified IS (green). In contrast, the kinetic PCR signal obtained from the IS following bidirectional Alu-gag preamplification (blue) is shifted roughly 12 threshold cycles to the left, corresponding to a 4-log amplification over the nonpreamplified control. (C) Twelve hours after spinoculation of CEM-SS-R5 cells with HIV-1 YU-2 (1,000 ng of p24 Gag /ml), proviruses comprise only a minority of HIV-1 DNA. The integration signal from the acutely infected cells (red) falls within the linear range of the preamplified IS (blue curves, corresponding to 3,300, 1,000, 330, 100, 30, and 12 proviruses per reaction). One-way preamplification with the gag primer alone (black) generates a signal that is similar to the signal obtained when the infection is performed in the presence of a 10 M dose of the integrase inhibitor L-731,988 (gray). This signal can be subtracted from the Alu-gag signal. It is produced via linear amplification of both integrated and unintegrated HIV-1 DNA. (D) Integration is not detected 12 h after spinoculation of CEM-SS-R5 cells with the HIV-1 YU2 -derived integrase-defective mutant virus D64A. Instead, Alu-gag preamplification results in a fivefold amplification, similar to one-way gag amplification. on April 1, 2020 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ since progeny virions are not released by these latently infected cells in the absence of immune activation (4, 7, 10), even when their nucleoside pools are exogenously enhanced (23) . The quantitative integration assay we have developed should prove useful in mechanistic studies to dissect these additional inefficiencies. It should also prove applicable to clinical and epidemiologic studies of viral integration and assessments of the effectiveness with which future antiretroviral treatments eradicate latent reservoirs of HIV-1.",

(C) Autoradiogram of the Southern blot prepared from the gel in panel B. Whereas integrated, linear, and circular forms of HIV-1 DNA were present in the acutely infected cells (left lane), only integrated forms of HIV-1 DNA were present in the IS (center lane). Uninfected cells were free of HIV-1 signals (right lane). The intensities of the HIV-1 bands in the acutely infected sample (where DNA was prepared 20 h after viral exposure) are higher than those in the IS, because spinoculation delivered such a high multiplicity of infection to the CEM-SS-R5 cells that multiple proviruses were established in the majority of cells in the sample. In contrast, following 4 weeks of drug selection, cells in the IS contained a mean (\u03ee standard deviation) of 1",
