This virus exists in a wide range of genetically and antigenically distinct types, making the prevention and control of this pathogen very challenging. While it is believed that the natural host of IBV is the chicken, the presence of IBV-like and other avian coronaviruses has been reported in both domestic and wide birds (Cavanagh, 2005 (Cavanagh, , 2007 , making the epidemiology and mechanisms of infection very complex.",

            "text": "The genomic architecture of coronaviruses, such as IBV, is characterized by two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode components of the viral replicase and occupy approximately two-thirds of the genome. ORFs encoding the structural proteins, spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N) phosphoprotein and envelope (E) protein, are located downstream of ORF1a/b and are expressed from 3\u2032 co-terminal subgenomic mRNAs (Brian and Baric, 2005; Sawicki et al., 2007) . The S protein is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 fragments. The S1 subunit of S protein carries the receptor binding site and thus plays an important role in tissue tropism (Belouzard et al., 2012) . The S1 protein is also the major inducer of neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies and thus plays an important role in protective immunity (Wickramasinghe et al., 2011) . In addition, S1 is the most variable gene among IBV isolates and such variability may lead to important biological differences between strains; novel serotypic variants could emerge as a result of amino acid changes in spike protein. Generally, the serotypes of IBV differ from each other by 20%-25% at the amino acid level in S1, but may differ by up to 50% (Cavanagh, 2007) . In some cases, as little as 2% variation, or 10-15 amino acid changes in the amino acid sequence, can lead to a new IBV serotype because the epitopes eliciting neutralizing antibodies are widely distributed within the spike protein sequence (Cavanagh, 2007; de Wit et al., 2011a; Hodgson et al., 2004) . Accordingly, analysis of the S1 gene has been conventionally used to determine viral genetic types (Valastro et al., 2016) .",

Furthermore, new genotypes of IBV and associated variants appear frequently in different parts of the world; these have arisen because of mutations, especially in the S1 subunit, including point mutations, insertions, deletions, and also recombination between different IBV strains (Cavanagh et al., 1992; Jackwood et al., 2012) . New genotypes often show antigenic variation and, hence, define new serotypes, and vaccinated poultry may still therefore be infected by serologically distinct strains of IBV. In addition, antigenic variants resulting in a reduced level of cross-protection between different strains represents a major obstacle for the development of an efficacious vaccine.",

(B) Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method with the general time-reversible nucleotide substitution model and bootstrap tests of 1000 replicates in the MEGA 6 program, using the 12 gene fragments (designated as 1-12) based on the above-mentioned results. Three IBV strains isolated in this study and six reference IBV strains were included. The GenBank accession numbers for these genome sequences are as follows: GX-YL9 (HQ850618), GX-YL5 (HQ848267), CQ04-1(HM245924), YN(JF893452), 4/91(KF377577) and ck/CH/LBJ/140402 (KF377577).",

In this study, we isolated three IBVs, \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0111/14, \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0114/14 and \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0118/14, from different regions in Guangxi province, China. As BLAST searches showed that the viruses presented S1 gene amino acid diversity higher than 10% in comparison to other genotypes and variants, we suggest that these isolates are novel IBV variants. It suggested that at least three complete S1 sequences of virus samples collected at least from two different outbreaks should be available for the identification of a novel genotype in the S1-based viral classification system (Valastro et al., 2016) . In this study, our three IBV isolates were obtained from different outbreaks. Phylogenetic analysis of their S1 genes showed that they were clustered into a novel lineage in genotype I (GI) and clearly set apart in the phylogenetic tree from the 96 reference strains. Therefore, the three isolates should be classified into a new lineage in genotype I (GI-29) according to the viral classification of IBV suggested by Valastro et al. (2016) . This new lineage appears to have the same origin from southern parts of China and is probably related to regional dissemination, although broader epidemiological studies should now be carried out in order to understand the spread of IBV in all Chinese poultry-producing regions.",

However, in some cases, highly similar strains show only limited cross-protection, while a high level of cross-protection may exist for strains with a much lower homology (de Wit et al., 2011a (de Wit et al., , 2011b . In this study, the S1 amino acid similarity between GI-29 and the other sequences available in the GenBank database was less than 89% and substitutions were found to be scattered across the S1 gene (Fig. 2) , suggesting that the accumulation of mutations in the S1 gene might account for the differing antigenicity of GI-29. Hence, these results indicate that GI-29 comprises not only a novel genotype but a new serotype as well. In addition, these data suggest that GI-29 may be protectotypically different from that of the H120 vaccine strain which might explain why G29-associated outbreaks occurred in H120-vaccination chicken flocks.",

            "text": "Although the GI-29 isolates clustered in the same group based on S1 gene sequences, they also showed different topologies in a multiple sequence alignment constructed with MAFFT v6 and SimPlot analysis using the complete genomic sequences. Based upon these results, 12 gene fragments were obtained and phylogenetically analyzed. Most of the gene fragments of GI-29 correlated with that of the GX-YL5 strain and with each other, although some showed divergence, implicating a common source. It has been speculated that IBV strains substitute large genomic fragments in multiple genes (Lee and Jackwood, 2001) . This is probably more likely the case for GI-29 viruses which might originate from a GX-YL5-like virus by accumulation of substitutions in multiple genes which has been evolving and diverging ever since its origin. Alternatively, it is also likely that some gene fragments are exchanged between viruses through recombination. Although we cannot conclude that recombination events have occurred in most parts of the genomes, we can point to the evolutionary trends in the 3\u2032 regions of GI-29 viral genomes as compared to the evolutionary trends in the replicase gene of the reference strains. The trends in the 3\u2032 regions of GI-29 virus genomes, especially in S1 gene, have shown ever increasing diversity, while it appears that the replicase gene is evolving with less variety between GI-29 and reference strains (Fig. 2) . This evolutionary trend has also been found in other IBV strains (Mondal and Cardona, 2004) . For isolate \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0114/14, we found that recombination events had occurred between nsps 2 and 3 in gene 1 region. The recombination led to the exchange of genetic material between vaccine strain and field isolates, therefore, resulting in the introduction of a 4/ 91 gene fragment into the virus \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0114/14. A similar phenomenon has also recently been found in Italy and Spain (Moreno et al., 2017) . IBV 793/B-type (4/91) and the Massachusetts-based vaccines are two major antigenic types which have been commonly used in China for a long time. However, the 4/91 vaccine induces only a partial protection against infection of most of the Chinese local IBV strains , such as the GX-YL5-like virus, which allows replication and circulation of both vaccine and field strains in a chicken and produces an environment where co-infection between field (i.e. GX-YL5like virus) and vaccine (i.e. 793B genotype) strains can enhance the likelihood of recombination. This is likely the case for the emergence of isolate \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0114/14 in this study and also cases found in other countries such as in Italy and Spain (Moreno et al., 2017) . In China, only limited numbers of 793/B type viruses have been detected and isolated in chicken flocks (Chen et al., 2015; Han et al., 2017) . Furthermore, both the S1 gene and the complete genomic sequence analysis showed that most of the detected 793/B field strains were of the vaccines, or vaccine-derived strains . Meanwhile, recombination events between vaccine strains (i.e. H120 and 4/91), and between field (i.e. GX-YL9-like virus, LX4/QX-like virus) and vaccine (i.e. 4/91) strains have resulted in the emergence of novel serotypes Liu et al., 2013) . Although the spread and effect of these novel strains, such as isolate \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0114/14, on the poultry industry required further evaluation, this study emphasizes the importance of improving vaccination tools in terms of both protection and application (Moreno et al., 2017) .",

Some virus strains may involve nephrosis and nephritis and are referred to as nephropathogenic strains which may not produce significant respiratory lesions or clinical signs. In this study, \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0111/ 14 did not cause severe respiratory clinical signs; however, its infection produced obvious swollen kidneys with tubules and ureters distended with urates in the dead chickens (Fig. 5A) . Furthermore, viral antigens were detected by IHC in the kidneys of all of the dead birds (Fig. 5B) , demonstrating that \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0111/14 is a nephropathogenic IBV strain. Infections of layers with many IBV strains in different genotypes/lineages were found to be related to cystic oviducts in layer flocks and involved in egg production problems such as a reduction in egg production and/or a reduction in egg quality. Of the 32 distinct viral lineages classified by Valastro et al. (2016) using all publicly available S1 gene sequences, viruses in 10 lineages were found to be associated with mild to severe reductions in egg production and/or egg quality, and so-called \"false layer\" syndrome. It was found that no lesions could be observed in the oviducts after infection with the pathogenic 4/91 type (Benyeda et al., 2009; de Wit et al., 2011b) , whereas, this genetic type was identified in Canadian outbreaks recently with predominantly respiratory disease and/or egg production problems (Martin et al., 2014) , implying that viruses in the same lineage showed different affinity to reproductive tracts and this might be IBV strain specific. In this study, we did not find any obvious lesions which related to cystic oviducts in the five surviving layer chickens challenged with isolate \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0111/14. It is possible that isolate \u03b3CoV/ck/China/I0111/14 cannot induce cystic oviducts in layer hens, or alternatively, that the virus can induce cystic oviducts but the small numbers of the chickens experimentally infected in this study were responsible for the differences in virus tropism. However, cystic oviducts were observed in 2 out of the 3, and 4 out of 6 surviving SPF chickens challenged with ck/CH/LGX/111119 and ck/CH/LDL/140520 (Gao et al., 2016) , respectively, at 1-day-old.

            "text": "The GI-29 type of IBV in this study was isolated from chickens vaccinated twice with H120 vaccine. These viruses are likely able to evade H120 induced immune response based on the results of the current study. However, the use of a combined heterologous vaccination is a common practice and it has been proven to broaden the protection spectrum (Cook et al., 1999) . This should be considered for prevention and control of GI-29 type IBVs in China in the future. In addition, it is believed that the wide-spread use of live-attenuated vaccine strains, and the subsequent selective pressure induced by neutralizing antibodies against the spike, may force adaption of the virus to escape immunity, and consequently result in faster evolutionary rates (Jackwood et al., 2012) . Hence, active epidemiological surveillance is urgently needed in order to acquire a better understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of GI-29 type viruses, and the updating of vaccines and/or vaccination programs may be required with further experimental studies to control GI-29 type viruses.
