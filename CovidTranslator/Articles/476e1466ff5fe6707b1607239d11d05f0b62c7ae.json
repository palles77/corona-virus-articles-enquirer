Table 1 reports the summary statistics of the main variables of the econometric model. The average number of passengers is 22.8 million in the sample data. The air ticket fares are calculated as a ratio of the total passenger revenues to the number of passengers for each airline and the overall average ticket fare is $238:8. 1 Note that it is a proxy since the ticket price data are not available in Europe. The average solidarity tax per passenger is $0:21. We include a network measure in the empirical model which is the total number of kilometers flown by an airline per year. We measure the market size as the total population of Europe and Central Asia since most of the air traffic of airlines in our sample is within this region. The model comprises demographic variables: Income and population of the country where airlines' headquarter is located. We measure income as the real GDP per capita (measured in 2011 $) of the country.",

For Lufthansa, for instance, only the flights originated form French airports are affected by the solidarity tax. This structure necessitates origin destination data in order to study the impact of solidarity tax. From AEA data, we obtain the number of passengers for business and economy classes within Europe and in the international markets for the airlines which are members of AEA. Note that the solidarity tax is charged per ticket depending on the destination and the fare class, and the AEA data provides the number of passengers for each class and network but not the ticket prices. The main drawback of European data is that ticket price data are not available. For that reason, we use data aggregated at firm level and compute a firm level average solidarity tax by taking the weighted average of tax, as follows: Table 1 .). This is probably due the strategy of yield management implemented by the airlines. We account for part of this heterogeneity through airline specific effects, time effects and effects of observable characteristic. The other effects are related at unobservable characteristics or at random effects that are included in our model, but probably not in the right structural way. Indeed we abstract from the dynamic aspects raised by the yield revenue management systems. How this affects measure of market power and degree of competition is an open question. We believe that in terms of the comparison among airlines, the average price is a correct and meaningful measure of the competitive positioning of each airline in the market.",

The market shares for Air France would increase while for other airlines the market share would almost not change in average. Hence, one can conclude that there would be more people using air transportation. Finally, these numbers compared to the growth rate of the air traffic show that the impact of the solidarity tax would be very small. Table 5 below displays the simulation results for average price and passenger traffic volume as well as the current ones for different airlines. In the case that the solidarity tax is adopted by all countries, Air France would have a 0:17% further increase in its price and the increase would be of 0:68% for Lufhtansa, 0:61% for British Airways and 0:7% for Easyjet. Note that the traffic volume of Lufthansa, British Airways and Easyjet would decrease. However for Air France, besides the further rise in its price, the passenger traffic would increase due to competition.",

It means that the solidarity tax is not fully added to the ticket price but it is added to the marginal cost of the airline. In these conditions, the solidarity tax should impact more the airlines than the customers. As a matter of fact, since the cost increases, even if the demand for air ticket is elastic, the airlines are able to pass a part of the cost increase to their clients. This is why eventually the fares increase. We estimate cost pass-through under the actual situation where only France implements and the case where all countries implement the solidarity tax. According to Table 6 , empirical results indicate that the passthrough rates for the European carriers fall between 94% and 103%. We find that the cost pass-through rate is 94.8% for Air France and 100.35% for all other carriers when the solidarity tax is charged only in France. Hence, Air France could not fully pass through the cost rising from the solidarity tax in the actual situation while the pass through rates for other carriers is around 100%. As a part of other carriers' network affected from the solidarity tax, they are able to pass the effect of cost changes on prices. However, Air France has to take up a part of cost in order to compete with other carriers. In the second case, the solidarity tax is implemented by all countries hence all airlines are charged for their whole network. Then, the pass-through rate increases for Air France and decreases for other carriers.",

Implementing the air ticket levy on all European airlines would not affect significantly the degree of competition among airlines. It is not surprising then that the expected gains from the solidarity tax are significant but relatively small.

We choose to fix the total market size, M, as the total population of Europe and Central Asia, a rough measure of potential passengers while still allowing the total number of air passengers, i.e. P J j\u00bc1 q j , to change. With this setting, as the number of passengers changes, the market share of the outside good, s 0 , also changes. Following Nevo (2000a) , we check the sensitivity of the demand model estimation to the market size measurement which is exogenous to the model. We observe that the parameter estimates of the demand model do not change for different market size measures. 2 In the model passenger demand (q j ), price (p j ) and weighted solidarity tax (t j ) are endogenous. The classical solution is to estimate the econometric model by instruments which are orthogonal to the unobservable variables of demand and pricing equations. In addition to exogenous variables in each equation, we build four variables as instruments following Berry et al. (1995) : 1) the average number of personals of rival carriers; 2) the average number of fleets of rival carriers; 3) the cross product of first two instruments; 4) first instrument multiplied by full service carrier dummy.

            "text": "All parameters have the expected sign. To begin with, the price coefficient, \u03b1, is positive hence the effect of price on passenger demand is always negative. In other words, any increase in ticket fare leads to a decrease in passenger demand. Moreover, \u03b1 is assumed to vary across airline main location (See Equation (10).). By specifying the price coefficient as in Equation (10), we introduce origin country dependent effects of price on passenger demand. As expected, \u03b1 1 is estimated to be negative and significant. Thus, passengers flying by an airline located in a richer country are expected to be less sensitive to ticket fare. Regarding the network related variable (total kilometre flown), a carrier with larger network size is likely to have higher demand. Overall, the airline dummies are consistent with what is expected. We estimate the demand and pricing equations of airlines, and then we use estimated parameters to back out estimates of their marginal costs. We then change the solidarity tax levels and solve the model to obtain new equilibrium prices. The results are presented in the simulation results section.",
