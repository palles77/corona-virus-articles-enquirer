Acinetobacter is a pathogen associated with VAP specifically, and the 3 encapsulated bacteria (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Klebsiella, and H influenzae) are all associated with particularly higher morbidity and mortality. 7 Mortality from pneumonia varies depending on the causative organism, but Streptococcus pneumoniae has the highest mortality. The incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae in 2008 was 100/100,000 adults/y. The mortality statistics for pneumococcal pneumonia in 2005 published by the World Health Organization were 1.6 million deaths worldwide. Even in developed countries the statistics indicate 10% to 20% mortality. The greatest risk of pneumococcal pneumonia is usually among people who have chronic illness such as lung, heart, or kidney disease, sickle cell anemia, or diabetes. But high rates are also noted in patients recovering from severe illness, those residing in nursing homes or chronic care facilities, and those patients older than 65 years. 8 Other high mortality causes include Klebsiella, Legionella, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).",

Studies have repeatedly shown sensitivity of blood cultures in patients admitted to the hospital with CAP to be between 7% and 10%. Patients with CAP who had blood cultures performed had a less than 2% chance of having a change in therapy directed by blood culture results. Severity of pneumonia, as measured by the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), also poorly correlates with the yield of blood cultures. 14 Blood cultures should be considered in patients who have a host defect in the ability to clear bacteremia. These patient groups include those with asplenia, complement deficiencies, chronic liver disease, and leucopenia. 15, 16 The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has made recommendations regarding the use of blood cultures in adult patients with CAP. 17 The AHRQ states that routine blood cultures are not recommended in patients admitted with CAP.

Despite this finding, when a sputum sample has more than 25 polymorphonuclear cells per low-power field and there is a predominant organism, the causative organism is identified in more than 80% of cases. The interpretation of the sputum culture is also problematic. For properly handled samples the sensitivity is approximately 75%. This sensitivity is lower if antibiotics therapy has been started before the sample is taken. In addition, because of the possibility of culturing bacteria that colonize the oropharynx, false-positive results may occur. This finding is especially true for debilitated patients, who are more likely to be colonized with pathogens. However, certain organisms are always pathogenic and can be assumed to be causing disease if they are identified. These organisms include Legionella species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and the endemic fungi. 19 The current IDSA/ATS guidelines for CAP in adults published in 2007 7 state that sputum cultures should be considered in patients when it is expected that the findings Pneumonia in Adults will result in a change in antibiotic management or that the test is likely to have high yield. The specific guidelines recommend therefore the use of sputum cultures in the following 8 circumstances: ICU admission; failure of outpatient antibiotic management; cavitary infiltrates; active alcohol abuse; severe obstructive or structural lung disease; positive Legionella urinary antigen test (UAT); positive pneumococcal UAT; or pleural effusion.",

Patients are first identified as low-risk and recommended for outpatient management. The low-risk patients are those less than 50 years, who do not have significant comorbid conditions, and who have no concerning features on physical examination. Patients who do not meet these low-risk criteria are then classified into categories based on age, comorbid illness, abnormal physical examination findings, and laboratory abnormalities. Scoring is divided into 5 classes and each class is associated with a predicted mortality: class 1, points 0, mortality 0.1%; class 2, points less than 70, mortality 0.6%; class 3, points 71-90, mortality 2.8%; class 4, points 91-130, mortality 8.2%; class 5, points greater than 130, mortality 29.2%. Classes 1, 2, and 3 are considered low-risk patients, class 4, moderate-risk, and class 5, high-risk. Hospital admission is recommended for those patients who score more than 91 (class 4).

Macrolide antibiotics are recommended as monotherapy in this patient population. The use of fluoroquinolones to treat ambulatory patients with pneumonia without comorbid conditions, risk factors for DRSP, or recent antibiotic use is not recommended because of the concern for the development of fluoroquinolone resistance. 40 Comorbidity or recent antimicrobial therapy increased the likelihood of infection with DRSP, and enteric gram-negative bacteria. In these patients, therapeutic options include either a respiratory fluoroquinolone or a combination therapy with a b-lactam antibiotic effective against Streptococcus pneumoniae plus a macrolide. Recommended b-lactams include: high-dose amoxicillin or amoxicillin clavulanate. Oral cephalosporins can also be used as alternatives. Agents in the same class as the patient has been receiving previously should not be used to treat patients with recent antibiotic exposure. For patients who are admitted to a hospital ward, the combination treatment of a b-lactam plus a macrolide or monotherapy with a fluoroquinolone has been shown to be associated with a significant reduction in mortality compared with that of the administration of a cephalosporin alone. 41 The choice between dual or monotherapy should be based on the patient's previous 3-month antibiotic exposure. Initial therapy for admitted patients is usually intravenous, but oral therapy can be considered for patients without risk factors for severe pneumonia, especially with highly bioavailable agents such as fluoroquinolones. 42 Patients admitted to the ICU with pneumonia are those who are usually diagnosed with severe pneumonia initially from the ED. The antimicrobial treatment in this patient population must be broader. The minimum recommended treatment of these patients is a b-lactam plus either azithromycin or a fluoroquinolone. For all patients admitted to the ICU, antimicrobial coverage should include that for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella. This combination therapy is recommended for at least 48 hours or until results of diagnostic tests are known. In the mechanically ventilated ICU patient, treatment with a fluoroquinolone alone has been associated with inferior outcome. 43 In the critically ill ICU patient with severe pneumonia, many microorganisms other than Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella sp must be considered. Of particular importance is Pseudomonas sp and gram-negative bacteria. 44 Therefore, standard empiric treatment regimes in this population should include coverage for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella sp, and H influenzae, all of the atypical organisms, Enterobacteriaceae sp, and Pseudomonadaceae sp (see Table 5 ). Penicillin-allergic patients should have the b-lactam substituted with azetreonam, a synthetic monocyclic b-lactam antibiotic. The excess mortality associated with MRSA indicates empiric coverage for this organism in this patient population. For suspected MRSA (end-stage renal disease, injection drug abuse, previous influenza, and previous recent antibiotic use) vancomycin or linezolid should be added.",

TB can occur in the early stage of HIV with CD4 cell counts less than 300 cells/mm 3 . Patients with HIV are more likely to develop active TB once infected and they have a higher risk of death. It is estimated that in 2009, there were 1.1 million HIV-positive patients with TB worldwide and 380,000 deaths from TB in the population with HIV. HIV is also the most important risk factor for progression from latent to active TB. Early diagnosis of TB can be difficult because of a lack of specific clinical findings, such as abnormal CXR or positive skin test result. In patients with more advanced HIV disease, extrapulmonary disease is more common. 76 Treatment of latent TB infection has been shown to reduce the risk of active TB in HIV-positive patients, especially those with a positive skin test. 77 ",
