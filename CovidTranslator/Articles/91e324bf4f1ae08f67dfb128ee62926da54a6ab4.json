Bioterrorism is the intentional use of microorganisms-bacteria, viruses, fungi, and toxins-to produce disease and death in humans, livestock, and/or crops (Eneh, 2012) . The bio agents could be carried by winds, insects, or birds, none of which respect national borders. It thus becomes very difficult to detect the biological agent or to determine whether the victim has been deliberately infected (Noah et al., 2002; Riedel, 2004) . The potential spectrum of bioterrorism ranges from hoaxes and use of non-mass casualty agents by individuals or small groups to state-sponsored terrorism that employs classic biological warfare (BW) agents and can produce large-scale outbreaks and mass casualties (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 1999) . Such scenarios would present serious challenges for patient treatment and for prophylaxis of exposed persons. Further, environmental contamination could pose continuing threats. Harmfulness or hazardous (threat) of biological agents like Nipah, Ebola, Anthrax, Plague, etc., has increased significantly with the involvement of non-state actors who would exploit not only for mass casualties, but also for a variety of other purposes from the strategic to the tactical, leading to huge economic loss and general social disruption (Szinicz, 2005; Eitzen, 2001) . Public awareness of the growing Advance detection technologies for select biothreat agents threat of bioterrorism is gaining momentum all over the world. Thus there is an increased demand for overall preparedness to address the challenges pertaining to the diagnosis, treatment, and prophylaxis of new and re-emerging maliciously incited infectious diseases (Snowden, 2008; Grundmann, 2014) . Anti-bioterrorism measures depend on the rapid biomonitoring of the situation as a part of pre-warning for immediate implementation of proper control measures (Parnell et al., 2010) .",

The main focus of biodefense is therefore to develop fast, sensitive, automatic technologies for the detection and identification of biological warfare agents with a high degree of selectivity, sensitivity, and specificity (Lim et al., 2005) . The detection technologies therefore focus on a variety of technologies including surface properties, genomic signatures, proteomics, etc. Ideally, a platform should be portable, easy to use, and capable of detecting multiple agents simultaneously. Platforms that integrate sample processing will have the benefit of reduced complexity for the operator. The sample processing method should be applicable for all sample types and all target analytes. In addition, instrumental techniques are widely used to detect toxins that are not amenable for DNA-based assays. The systems currently available for sensing biological analytes rely primarily on two technologies: reporter molecules that attach to antibodies and give off fluorescent signals, and the molecular PCR technology that amplifies suspect DNA. Because two steps are required to identify biological weapons, the procedure is both labor-and time-intensive (Huang et al., 2012; Martin et al., 2003) .",

From a preparedness perspective, early detection and response are crucial to minimize the potential consequences (Bravata et al., 2004) . Systems to detect bioterrorism agents in clinical and environmental samples and to diagnose bioterrorism-related illnesses are essential components of responses to both hoaxes and actual bioterrorism events. The ability to identify rapidly the introduction of a bioterrorist agent into the civilian population will require highly sensitive, specific, inexpensive, high-throughput, and easy-to-use diagnostic tools Rotz and Hughes, 2004) . Ideally, these tests could also evaluate the possible spectrum of antimicrobial resistance and be connected to a central database. Centralized confirmatory testing also should be expanded to include routine evaluations of positive samples for genetic profiling, and bioengineered properties. The theoretical ability to design and develop such assays exist, e.g., microchip-based platforms, which could contain thousands of microbial signature profiles that are either nucleic acid or protein based, providing standards for validation and comparison of potential products (Lillehoj et al., 2010; Ewalt et al., 2001) .

A second layer, or sub-membrane, inhibits the immediate back-flow of fluids, which can obscure results. These tests can be used to detect both antibodies and antigens. To detect antibodies and antigens, the corresponding analyte is bound or immobilized as a dot or line on the membrane. This reagent \"captures\" the analyte as it flows through the membrane. To perform the test, a sample is applied to the membrane and allowed to wick through by capillary action. Thereafter, sequentially, there is a wash step, addition of the signal reagent, and a second wash to clear the membrane. Recent flow-through tests have successfully used colored latex particles or colloidal gold. This is a very rapid test procedure (3-5 min). However, these are not \"walk-away\" tests as the lateral-flow test is. Test sensitivity is good for serological assays, but for solid-phase tests, detection of antigens is often less sensitive than lateral-flow or enzyme immunoassays (EIA) methods (Fan, 1991) .",

The major advantage of the nucleic acid-based system is its specificity due to the uniqueness of genome in living systems. The careful designing of primer and probes enables specific detection of organisms. It also offers the highest sensitivity due to exponential amplification of the genomic signature. During PCR, a short piece of genome (DNA/RNA) of the biothreat agent is amplified, resulting in millions of copies of DNA within a short time (Towner et al., 2004; Mourya et al., 2012) . A number of commercial versions of PCR systems are now available which consist of a disposable assay cartridge containing consumable reagents, an instrument that integrates the thermal components required for gene amplification, and the optical components required to quantify the amplified products (generally tagged with a fluorescent dye). Further, positive and negative controls are included as part of the assay to rule out reaction failure and validate both the assay and instrument performance. Sample preparation remains one of the important critical areas for the realization of on-site nucleic acid amplification systems. The results of PCR vary widely depending on the presence of inhibitors in the sample and are more crucial from complex environmental matrices, which require sample processing. Different modifications to the conventional PCR have been made that enable the simultaneous detection of multiple threat agents. The multiplex PCR substantially reduces cost and time (Nazarenko et al., 2002) . The general contamination of source DNA in toxin samples is now exploited to identify the toxins.",

RT-PCR measures changes in fluorescence intensity which is proportional to the increase of the amplicon. RT-PCR are primarily of two types: specific and non-specific. In non-specific RT-PCR, a universal DNA interacting dye like SYBR Green is used that emits fluorescence when bound to DNA. Further, a melting curve analysis is performed following amplification that provides specificity based on the length and composition of amplicon. This format is simpler to perform and inexpensive due to requirement of only primers. The specific detection relies on the use of unique target genome-specific fluorogenic labeled probes. The increase in fluorescence indicates the hybridization of probes to the target DNA, leading to physical separation of the fluorophore from the quencher (Liu et al., 2012) . In contrast to non-specific SYBR Green format, probe-based assays provide multiplex capability through use of different fluorescent dyes. TaqMan Probes have been successfully employed for detection of multiple biothreat agents including Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Coxiella burneti, Cat A biothreat viral agents including smallpox, Ebola, and other hemorrhagic viruses (Buzard et al., 2012) .",

Magnetic nanomaterials help in concentrating an analyte from a complex matrix and can also provide feedback even in opaque solutions. Quantum-confined semiconducting nanomaterials possess photophysical properties that can be exploited for tagging analytes and participating in energy transfer, while their physical properties make them more durable than dyes and suited to a non-laboratory environment.

Unique identification of the sample is possible through comparison with a reference database.

They act as powerful analytical tools in medicine, environmental diagnostics, and food industries, as well as forensic analysis and counterterrorism. Biodetectors usually consist of a biological recognition system, typically enzymes or binding proteins immobilized on a surface acting as a physicochemical transducer. One typical example of a biodetector is the immunosensor, which uses antibodies as the biorecognition system. In addition to enzymes and antibodies, the recognition systems can consist of nucleic acids, whole bacteria, and single-cell organisms, and even tissues of higher organisms. Specific interactions between the target molecule or analyte and the complementary biorecognition layer produce a detectable physico-chemical change, which can then be measured by the detector. The detection system can take many forms depending upon the parameters being measured. Electrochemical, optical, mass, or thermal changes are the most common parameters providing both qualitative or quantitative data. Electrochemical biosensors are promising platforms that could achieve rapid highly sensitive and selective on-site detection of such agents (Qian and Bau, 2004; Berchebru et al., 2014) .",
