For values of the transmission rate larger than a threshold, the final epidemic size on SF networks is smaller than that on corresponding random networks. While in random networks new infectious and traced nodes from all classes have similar average degrees, in SF networks the average degree of nodes that are in more advanced stages of the disease is higher at any given time. On SF networks tracing removes possible sources of infection with high average degree. However a higher tracing effort is required to control the epidemic than on corresponding random networks due to the high initial velocity of spread towards the highly connected nodes. An increased latency period fails to significantly improve contact tracing efficacy. Contact tracing has a limited effect if the removal rate of susceptible nodes is relatively high, due to the fast local depletion of susceptible nodes.",

The degree of a node is its total number of links k. The theory of random networks, where the probability that a randomly chosen node has k links, P(k), and follows a binomial distribution with mean KZhki, is well established (Erd\u0151s & R\u00e9nyi 1959) . Random networks have been and are used to model many real networks (Keeling 1999; Huerta & Tsimring 2002; Eames & Keeling 2003) . While there are problems with interpreting empirical data describing real networks (Jones & Handcock 2003; Stumpf et al. 2005) , it has been recognized (Albert & Barab\u00e1si 2002; Christley et al. 2005 ) that the degree distributions of many empirically measured networks do not follow a Binomial distribution (Poisson distribution in case of large networks), but can be approximated by a scale-free (SF) distribution P\u00f0k\u00def k Kg , with 2%g%3. SF networks (Albert & Barab\u00e1si 2002) have very different features when compared with standard random networks, and are characterized by high heterogeneity in node connectivity, with most of the nodes having a small number of links, while a relatively small number of nodes have a very large number of connections.",

The proportion of susceptible nodes removed by tracing will depend on the disease (i.e. how easy it is to define what a truly dangerous contact is), the availability and quality of early diagnostic tests, and logistical constraints such as number of qualified personnel involved in contact tracing. Contact tracing where only infectious nodes are traced has been considered in the context of randomly distributed networks (Huerta & Tsimring 2002) and randomly distributed clustered networks (Eames & Keeling 2003) . Recently Kiss et al. (2005) have considered the effect of removing susceptible nodes by tracing on random and clustered networks. Surprisingly, no study has yet directly compared disease control on SF and random networks for given epidemiological parameters. This is done here, first for a simple disease model with no control, and then allowing for the identification and removal of nodes that are at risk of becoming infected-i.e. 'contact tracing'-is considered.",

While this is not strictly true, the assumption simplifies the system, and the effect of continued tracing can be approximated by increasing the tracing rate from class (T ) nodes.

Contact tracing often identifies some contacts that were not truly infectious (e.g. through human error, logistical constraints compromising testing accuracy, or a lack of rapid and conclusive diagnosis tests).

This is a difficult task even in the first step contact tracing, therefore further contact tracing is very rare. Another impediment is the difficulty in determining the status of the traced premises due to the absence of a quick and reliable diagnostic test for some diseases (e.g. FMD). Multiple-stage contact tracing is usually carried out where traced individuals are isolated and can be monitored for signs of infection. This is not the case for livestock diseases where traced premises are usually culled. M\u00fcller et al. (2000) also concludes that tracing a very small number of steps from the index case may already practically maximize the effect that can be reached by tracing.

Only nodes with kR3 are chosen, to support a realistic epidemic where K must exceed the number of new infections in the first generation. The value of k is accepted as a node degree with a probability k Kg . If k is not accepted then it is discarded and a new k is generated. The procedure is repeated until a value for k is accepted for every node in the network and the sum of the degree of all the nodes is even. References to each node are placed in a set such that the number of references to each node is equal to the node degree. Thereafter, two members are chosen at random from the set and a link is formed if these nodes are not already connected. Self-loops are not considered as possible links. This operation is repeated until all the members of the set are exhausted. The even number of members ensures that after repeated link forming operations all the nodes will have a number of links equal to their degree.

However, as r SE increases, there is a critical value of r SE where the final epidemic sizes are the same for both types. From there on, final epidemic size for random networks approaches its asymptote (total population size) more rapidly than for SF networks. As r SE increases, resulting in a higher total epidemic size, the disease depletes the population of highly connected nodes, and must propagate to the poorly connected nodes, which are less accessible.

Consider the case when r SR is fixed and r ER (Zr IR ) is varied. If the epidemic is out of control, an increase in r ER (Zr IR ) results in more infected nodes being removed. While the current reproduction ratio of the epidemic remains above one, the epidemic incidence will on average continue to increase, and the trend of increasing numbers of removed infected nodes can be expected to continue, as long as the total number of susceptible nodes is not depleted. However, should higher rates of tracing r ER (Zr IR ) be sufficient to reduce the reproduction rate below one, the proportion of infected nodes removed by tracing will start to decrease; i.e. tracing will be considered to have effectively controlled the epidemic. Thus, although r ER (Zr IR ) is high, the proportion of infected nodes removed by tracing is small since the production of new infected nodes is reduced.

Figure 5 is the same as figure 4 but with an increased latency period from Lat_PZ3.5 to Lat_PZ10.0.

This implies an extremely small time-scale t for the outbreak and a very rapid spread of the epidemic in networks with highly heterogeneous connectivity. Barth\u00e9lemy et al.

We note that in the absence of tracing the change in the average degree of new infectious nodes follows a similar pattern. In random networks (figure 6a) the average degree of all the different categories of nodes are similar throughout the epidemic time course. All types start at hk 2 i=hkiZ hkiC 1Z K C 1 which is the average degree of nodes that can be reached from a randomly selected node in any network. The average degree of newly infected nodes and nodes traced from a given (T ) class node reflect only this network property (as in the 'acquaintance sampling' described by Madar et al. (2004) ) and thus they are of the same degree. This is seen in figure 6a for random networks, and figure 6b for SF networks. However, the average degrees of both exposed and infectious nodes removed by tracing are considerably higher than the former categories of nodes. This is a finite size effect; nodes of high degree tend to be infected first and as these are depleted the average degree decreases. Thus the 'age' of traced nodes must be considered. The average duration that nodes spend in state E and state I, considered from when the node became infected in the absence of network related tracing, are 1/r EI and (1/r EI C1/r IT ) respectively. Traced nodes arising from these classes reflect the average degree of nodes infected at an earlier time (figure 6).",

In the case without control, the disease preferentially spreads towards the highly connected nodes. Due to depletion of highly connected nodes, proportionately more nodes with lower connectivity are infected towards the end of the epidemic. When effective control is applied, depletion of highly connected nodes occurs more slowly, and therefore the average degree of new infectious nodes remains high. Thus, the average degree of the new infectious nodes at higher levels of tracing will be more evenly distributed over the duration of the epidemic, in contrast to the highly skewed distribution when disease is spreading without control. The inset of figure 7 shows that the daily average number of new infectious nodes falls sharply as the r ER (Zr IR ) tracing rate is increased. Therefore, the higher daily average degree of new infectious nodes that corresponds to higher levels of tracing r ER (Zr IR ) later is indicative of superior but still ineffective control.",

Contact tracing never catches up sufficiently to eliminate the highly connected nodes before they become infectious, and only 'intelligent' tracing (for example through prior knowledge of who may be most highly connected) would be effective. Figures S3 and S4 (see electronic supplementary material) show, for the same networks and parameter values as figures 4 and 5, that R N is insensitive relative to changes in r SR . Therefore unless tracing of exposed and infected nodes happens quickly and accurately the loss encountered at the population level is virtually constant with regards to changes in r SR . Disease contact tracing can make a real difference on both random and SF networks when the tracing rate of susceptible nodes is low.

A control policy that results in removal of many susceptibles can be the result of many factors, including human error, time constraints in determining whether a node is truly infected, an insufficiently specific diagnosis test, or deliberate policy. There may be significant economic or moral cost associated with removal of susceptible nodes; the main advantage in this case is a shorter epidemic duration. Ideal control measures; however, should stop an epidemic early or while there are still many unaffected susceptible nodes. Should contacts between nodes be highly clustered, the removal of susceptible nodes can reduce the local susceptible neighbourhood surrounding infectious nodes (Eames & Keeling 2003; Kiss et al. 2005) , rendering it an effective means of disease control. This is often acceptable, for example when removal by tracing actually means quarantine or isolation (such as SARS), or if the consequences of transmission are severe, but is much more debatable when traced nodes are destroyed, especially when there is some controversy over how seriously the disease problem is viewed (such as 2001 FMD epidemic in UK; Haydon et al. 2004) .

It is, therefore, imperative to understand how to best use the available data about a network on which disease can spread in order to better prevent or control epidemics. By analysing disease transmission on different network topologies, one can hope to identify trademark signatures of different disease models spreading on different network architectures. Such results might help solve the inverse problem of what network or disease parameters can be recovered from data collected during an epidemic, which can be critical in deciding amongst different control policies.
