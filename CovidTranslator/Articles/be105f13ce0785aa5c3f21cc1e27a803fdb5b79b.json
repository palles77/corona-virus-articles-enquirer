The vaccine preparation was tested with or without adjuvants. Adjuvant Systems AS01 B and AS03 A were selected and tested for their capacity to elicit high humoral and cellular immune responses to WI-SARS vaccine. We evaluated the effect of vaccine dose and each adjuvant on immunogenicity and efficacy in mice, and the effect of vaccine dose with or without the AS01 B adjuvant on the immunogenicity and efficacy in hamsters. Efficacy was evaluated by challenge with wild-type virus at early and late time points (4 and 18 wk post-vaccination). A single dose of vaccine with or without adjuvant was poorly immunogenic in mice; a second dose resulted in a significant boost in antibody levels, even in the absence of adjuvant. The use of adjuvants resulted in higher antibody titers, with the AS01 B -adjuvanted vaccine being slightly more immunogenic than the AS03 A -adjuvanted vaccine. Two doses of WI-SARS with and without Adjuvant Systems were highly efficacious in mice. In hamsters, two doses of WI-SARS with and without AS01 B were immunogenic, and two doses of 2 mg of WI-SARS with and without the adjuvant provided complete protection from early challenge. Although antibody titers had declined in all groups of vaccinated hamsters 18 wk after the second dose, the vaccinated hamsters were still partially protected from wild-type virus challenge. Vaccine with adjuvant provided better protection than non-adjuvanted WI-SARS vaccine at this later time point. Enhanced disease was not observed in the lungs or liver of hamsters following SARS-CoV challenge, regardless of the level of serum neutralizing antibodies.",

The causative agent was a newly-identified coronavirus (CoV) that spread to humans from a yet unidentified animal reservoir through civet cats and possibly other infected animals (2) (3) (4) . The spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is the attachment protein and the target of the protective neutralizing antibody response (5) . Several SARS-CoV vaccines have been developed using different vaccine platforms, including whole inactivated, subunit, DNA, vectored, and live virus vaccines (6) (7) (8) . The immunogenicity and efficacy of some of these experimental vaccines have been evaluated in animal models such as mice, hamsters, ferrets, and non-human primates, and a few of them have been evaluated in phase I clinical trials (6, 9, 10) . In general, vaccines that elicit a robust serum neutralizing antibody response in animal models provide protection from challenge with virus (11) . The inclusion of aluminum salts and saponin as adjuvants has been reported to enhance the immunogenicity of subunit and inactivated virus vaccines (12, 13) .",

A second dose of vaccine induced a significant boost in neutralizing antibody titers at all dose levels, with or without adjuvants (Fig. 2) .

All of the vaccinated animals had higher serum neutralizing antibody titers than mice that had recovered from infection with 10 5 TCID 50 of SARS-CoV, although this study and previous studies in mice and hamsters have shown that low levels of neutralizing antibodies are sufficient to prevent detectable viral replication following challenge (12, 21) .

In a comparison of vaccines against influenza A virus in two different mouse strains, a whole inactivated virus vaccine produced higher neutralizing and hemagglutination inhibition antibody titers than either virosomal or subunit vaccines (22) . The presentation and stability of the antigenic targets for viral neutral-ization in a whole inactivated vaccine mimic those of the wild-type virus better than subunit or virosomal vaccines, and this may account for the greater immunogenicity of whole-virion vaccines. Furthermore, whole inactivated vaccines can present complex antigenic targets for neutralization that subunit vaccines are not able to reproduce, such as conformational interactions between VP1 and VP3 of hepatitis A virus (23) . Although antibodies raised to SARS-CoV S-protein are sufficient for virus neutralization, whole inactivated vaccines present the S-proteins in trimeric conformation, mimicking the wild-type virus. Additionally, whole inactivated vaccines are also more cost effective and more easily generated than recombinant vectored vaccines.",

BPL was selected as the inactivating agent because it can break the structure of nucleic acids through reaction with the purine base, and has been widely used for the inactivation of DNA and RNA viruses. See et al. (13) found that a BPL-inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine adjuvanted with alum generated higher titers of neutralizing antibodies and was more protective in mice than a recombinant adenovirus vaccine expressing S and N proteins. Multiple virus inactivation approaches, such as UV irradiation, formalin, or BPL treatment, have been used to prepare whole virus-inactivated vaccines (6). Interestingly, SARS-CoV virions that were inactivated by UV irradiation and additional formalin treatment skewed the cellular immune response toward the Th-2 type, possibly because carbonyl groups were generated by formalin, as was recently described by Moghaddam et al. (24) and Tsunetsugu-Yokota et al. (25) . Vero cells are a certified cell line currently used for the production of registered poliovirus and rotavirus vaccines. High infectious titers and virion yields were obtained during preparation of the SARS-CoV vaccine. These features present an attractive basis for further industrial development.",

The results of many of these studies indicate that neutralizing antibody responses to the S-protein are an important correlate of immunity against SARS in preclinical models. The magnitude of the antibody response can be significantly increased with adjuvants (12) . Recent studies employing a new generation of adjuvants developed by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals have clearly demonstrated the superiority of these Adjuvant Systems over alum or non-adjuvanted vaccines (e.g., HPV 16/18 L1 VLP adjuvanted with AS04) (26) . Additionally, recombinant circumsporozoite protein-based vaccine RTS,S adjuvanted with AS01 B (27) , and seasonal and pandemic split influenza vaccine adjuvanted with AS03 (28), were more robust in terms of dose-sparing, breadth of cross-protection, and the induction of long-term immunity.

Activation of toll-like receptor 4 by MPL acts not only on innate immune responses, but also on the induction of both humoral and cellular immune responses. In addition, QS21 has also been shown to improve humoral and cell-mediated immunity in preclinical and clinical trials (32) . Notably, the animals vaccinated with vaccine including the AS01 B adjuvant did not develop measurable CD8 T-cell responses in PBMCs. Nevertheless, in a previous experiment CD8 T-cell responses were detected in the spleens of animals immunized with this adjuvanted vaccine. This response could play a role in protection against SARS CoV. Although AS03 A can be considered to be a potent adjuvant for the antibody response, this oil-in-water-based adjuvant has been shown to induce local inflammation and attract immunocompetent cells to the injection site (28) . Furthermore, the plant-derived liposoluble vitamin E (DL-atocopherol) included in this Adjuvant System increases antibody titers by enhancing production of cytokines, leading to greater proliferation of T cells through reduced production of prostaglandin PGE 2 , a T-cell-suppressive factor (33) . These characteristics of the AS03 A adjuvant could explain the relatively high cellular immune response observed in mice immunized with this adjuvant. In this context, Leroux-Roels et al. (33) found that CD4 T cells (but not CD8 T cells) are important in the control of disease pathogenesis and SARS replication in primary SARS-CoV infection in senescent mice. ",

Based on promising data from studies in mice, the WI-SARS vaccine was evaluated in golden Syrian hamsters, a model in which efficacy can be measured by quantitative virology, as well as pulmonary pathology following challenge (15) . The BPL-inactivated WI-SARS vaccine was immunogenic and efficacious in hamsters. In general, these observations are consistent with other studies of SARS vaccines, in which vaccines that elicit a robust serum neutralizing antibody response in animal models provide protection from challenge with virus (7,11), though systemic antibodies may not confer sterilizing immunity in all models, and mucosal immunity may enhance the level of protection (8, 34) . Our study also demonstrated an additional correlate of reduced histological evidence of lung disease in vaccinated hamsters. Furthermore, even at very low neutralizing antibody titers (log 2 2.7) there was evidence of protection, with a 100-to 3000-fold reduction in virus titer and reduced histopathology. As recommended by the WHO (11), we also evaluated the efficacy of the WI-SARS vaccine at both early and late time points to assess the duration of protection in hamsters. In our study, vaccine-induced protection lasted 4 months in hamsters, and protection from replication of challenge virus was more robust over time in the presence of AS01 B adjuvant than in its absence (two-way ANOVA p 0.05 for comparing the no-adjuvant and AS01 B -adjuvant vaccine groups). We examined the lung and liver for evidence (F) A lack of viral antigen is seen here in mild lung lesions of a hamster that was previously infected with SARS-CoV (hematoxylin, 400\u00c2).

This protection correlated with the presence of high serum neutralizing antibody titers in these animals. However, a decline in antibody titers was observed in hamsters after 16 wk. This decline was less pronounced in animals immunized with the adjuvanted vaccine. Better and more robust protection from late challenge was seen in animals immunized with adjuvanted WI-SARS vaccine than in animals immunized with the non-adjuvanted WI-SARS vaccine. These data were confirmed by the absence of histopathological findings in the lungs of these animals. In addition, these data indicate that the adjuvantation of the WI-SARS vaccine is important for antigen sparing. We have demonstrated the advantages of including an adjuvant to achieve highly protective and sustained immune responses, while maintaining an acceptable level of safety for this vaccine. The use of adjuvants to potentiate the immunogenicity of the WI-SARS preparation did not result in any measurable lung pathology or other safety concerns in vaccinated animals. The decline in the efficacy of the vaccine measured at 18 wk (late challenge), compared to early (4 wk) challenge, coincides with the decline of neutralizing antibody responses seen over time. Interestingly, no decline in protective efficacy upon late challenge was seen in hamsters that were initially infected with live SARS-CoV. Since these animals had similar neutralizing antibody titers at the time of challenge relative to vaccinated animals, it is possible that other components of the adaptive immune response are involved in this sustained and robust protection.",

Shown are percentages of WI-SARS-specific CD4 \u00fe T-cell responses (geometric mean titer AE CI 95%) in PBMCs obtained on day 7 post-immunization, and re-stimulated with 1 mg/mL WI-SARS (based on S-protein content). Vaccine dose and adjuvant are indicated along the x-axis. The dose indicates the amount of SARS-CoV Sprotein (''S'') as part of the WI-SARS material administered to each mouse. One-way ANOVA with Tukey post-test demonstrated statistically significant differences between the groups indicated (*p 0.05). FIG. 4. Efficacy of WI-SARS vaccine in BALB/c mice. Shown are the mean virus titers in lungs 2 d after challenge with 10 5 TCID 50 /mouse SARS-CoV. Vaccine dose and adjuvant are indicated along the x-axis. The dose listed is the amount of SARS-CoV-S-protein (''S'') administered to each mouse. Control groups included mice immunized with a Vero cell-grown BPLinactivated influenza virus vaccine (Flu-BPL), adjuvants AS01 B and AS03 A alone, PBS, and primary infection with SARS-CoV.
