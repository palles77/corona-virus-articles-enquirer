The canonical MHV receptor CEACAM1a and its spike-binding site have been extensively characterized. However, CEACAM1a is poorly expressed in neurons, and the extremely neurotropic MHV strain JHM.SD infects ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 mice and spreads among ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 neurons. Two proposed alternative MHV receptors, CEACAM2 and PSG16, also fail to account for neuronal spread of JHM.SD in the absence of CEACAM1a. JHM.SD has been reported to have an unusually labile spike protein, enabling it to perform receptor-independent spread (RIS), but it is not clear that the ability to perform RIS is fully responsible for the extremely neurovirulent phenotype. We propose that the extreme neurovirulence of JHM.SD is multifactorial and might include as-yet unidentified neuronspecific mechanisms of spread.",

            "text": "Interruption of virus entry by targeting virus-receptor interactions has long been a goal of vaccination and antibody therapy, and more recently, of small-molecule pharmaceutical therapy as well; there are now antiretroviral drugs targeting both the HIV envelope protein and its co-receptor CCR5. As the species specificity of coronaviruses is most often attributed to receptor availability, the cross-species transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) human coronavirus in 2002 focused a great deal of attention on the spikereceptor interaction as a target for therapeutic intervention (recently reviewed1). However, our experience with the neurotropic strains of the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a widely used model for encephalitis and demyelinating disease; see Box 1) suggests a paradox: although the spike protein is the most important determinant of neurovirulence 10 -11, coronavirus neurotropism cannot be fully explained by receptor usage. Two recent studies have confirmed this view. Mice lacking the canonical MHV receptor, CEACAM1a, remain susceptible to viruses expressing the spike protein from the extremely neurotopic JHM.SD (MHV-4) strain of MHV 12. (JHM.SD is the most neurovirulent isolate13 of the neurotropic JHM strain, also called MHV-4, which was derived by serial passage through mouse brain 14) . And although JHM.SD spreads efficiently among adjacent ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 neurons, no known alternative receptor is both expressed in neurons and capable of conferring MHV susceptibility on non-permissive cells 15 . Here we review the known MHV receptor(s) and their spike protein-binding site, as well as the phenomenon of \"receptorindependent spread\" (RIS) performed by JHM.SD. Based on current knowledge, we believe that neither receptor usage nor RIS can fully explain JHM.SD pathogenesis and hypothesize that the extreme neurotropism displayed by this strain must be multifactorial and include asyet unidentified neuron-specific mechanisms of spread. Further studies of neurotropic MHV strains in ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 mice should clarify the mechanism(s) of MHV neurovirulence and guide future attempts to target the spike proteins of encephalitis viruses for therapeutic intervention.",

            "text": "The canonical receptor for the murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), CEACAM1a, was one of the earliest virus receptors identified. The SJL/J strain of inbred mice had long been noted to be resistant to MHV, whereas other strains (such as BALB/c) were susceptible. MHV was demonstrated to bind to a 100-110 kD protein in BALB/c tissues but not to SJL/J tissue extracts 16 . Inoculation of mice with a partially purified protein extract produced a monoclonal antibody, CC1 17, which blocked MHV infection of cultured cells 18 and mice 19. This antibody was used to further purify the receptor 17 , which upon sequencing proved to be a mouse carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) family member 20 identical to the open reading frame of a transcript, mmCGM1, that was identified by screening a mouse cDNA library with a probe homologous to human CEA 21. The same screen produced a second transcript, mmCGM2 22, which was initially misidentified as a splice variant of mmCGM1 23 and later shown to be a different allele for which the resistant SJL/J mice are homozygous24. (The cDNA library was derived from mice from the outbred CD-1 strain 21 that were apparently heterozygous at the receptor locus). Although the SJL/J allele acts as an MHV receptor if over-expressed in tissue culture, it fails to bind MHV virions in virus overlay protein blot assays, and the soluble form has fourfold less virus neutralizing activity than the functional allele 25. This suggests that it is too weak a receptor to function at endogenous levels; in addition, it is not recognized by CC1 24. The nomenclature was further complicated by the existence of multiple splice forms 26; thus, in 1999, the nomenclature of the entire CEA family was revised with the functional MHV receptor allele designated ceacam1a and the MHV-resistant SJL/J allele designated ceacam1b 27 (Table 1) .",

            "text": "The MHV binding site on CEACAM1a has been extensively characterized. The murine CEA family belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily and contains two branches: the transmembrane domain-anchored CEACAM proteins and the secreted pregnancy-specific glycoproteins (PSG) proteins. The extracellular portions of these proteins consist of different numbers of variable (V)-(usually N-terminal and designated N) and constant-type (C) immunoglobulin-like domains (divided into \"A\" and \"B\" subsets and numbered by subset), and many proteins have multiple splice variants 27 . CEACAM1a consists of a V-type \"N\" domain followed by either three (A1, B, A2) or one (A2) C-type domains, a transmembrane domain, and a long or short cytoplasmic tail. All four possible splice variants are expressed, generating CEACAM1a-4L, CEACAM1a-4S, CEACAM1a-2L, and CEACAM1a-2S 27 (see Figure 1 for illustration and Table 1 for old nomenclature). All four forms support MHV infection in cultured cells 24. Both MHV and CC1 have been shown to bind the N domain 31 , albeit at slightly different (if overlapping) sites: MHV requires amino acids 34-52 of CEACAM1a, whereas CC1 requires amino acids 1-70 and specifically residues 26-32, 42, and 43 32 . Independent work identified the contiguous six-amino acid motif at position 38-43 as crucial for MHV binding 33, and it is noteworthy that CEACAM1b has no homology with CEACAM1a at this sequence ( Figure 2 ). Although the N domain is necessary and sufficient for neutralization and receptor activity 34 , a truncated soluble protein containing only the N and A1 domains neutralizes less efficiently than either the two-or four-domain form, suggesting that the fourth Ig-like domain improves MHV binding 25 . The crystal structure of the soluble two-domain protein shows no interaction between the N and A2 domains; however, the critical MHV-binding residues 38-43 are prominently displayed on the CC' loop of the N domain, which is stabilized in an unusually complex conformation relative to related proteins 35 . The ability of CEACAM1a to bind MHV is thus well understood.",

Notably, although some strains of MHV (including A59 and the highly neurotropic JHM) cause central nervous system (CNS) disease, CEACAM1a is poorly expressed in the CNS relative to other MHV target tissues such as the intestine and the liver 15, 20. Furthermore, neurons, which are the predominant CNS cell type infected by both A59 and JHM 11 , 15, express even lower levels of ceacam1a mRNA than other CNS cell types 15 . However, the ability of A59 to spread among wild-type but not ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 hippocampal neuron cultures implies that neurons do express CEACAM1a protein 15 , although the possibility that A59 actually requires that the CEACAM1a be expressed by contaminating microglia cannot be ruled out. By contrast, the JHM.SD spike mediates spread even among ceacam1a \u2212/\u2212 neurons, although initial infection rates are strikingly lower than for wild-type neurons 15 . At this time, the role of CEACAM1a in MHV infection of the CNS is not clear.",

            "text": "One possible explanation for the discrepancy between CEACAM1a expression and MHV infection in neurons is that MHV uses an alternative receptor to infect neurons. This hypothesis is supported by the reduced affinity of the JHM spike for CEACAM1b relative to the A59 spike 25, [36] [37] , suggesting that the receptor-binding domains of the two proteins differ in a biologically relevant fashion. Two CEA family members have been identified as possible alternative receptors: CEACAM2 and PSG16 ( Figure 1 ). CEACAM2 (previously Bgp2) is similar to CEACAM1a in overall structure, but the MHV-binding loop at amino acids 38-43 has more homology to CEACAM1b (Figure 2 ). Like CEACAM1b, CEACAM2 can support MHV infection if it is over-expressed in non-permissive cells 29 , but the purified soluble form is less efficient at neutralizing MHV than that of CEACAM1a 25 . Studies of the receptor efficiency of the two proteins have been hampered by the inability to control for receptor density, but it is generally believed that CEACAM2 is a less efficient receptor than CEACAM1a 15, 29 . At this time, it is not clear whether endogenous levels of CEACAM2 can support MHV infection. In addition, ceacam2 mRNA is even more poorly expressed in neurons and glial cells than ceacam1a 15 . Together, these data suggest that, although CEACAM2 might be an alternative MHV receptor, it is not likely to account for the ability of JHM to spread in ceacam1a\u2212/\u2212 neurons.",

Two isoforms of PSG16 have been reported 30, 38 ( Figure 1 ). The first, PSG16-4(N1*)C1 (formerly known as bCEA; Table 1 ), was isolated from mouse brain by screening with a probe homologous to ceacam1a 30 The second, PSG16-4(N1*)C2, was derived from sequencing clones from a cDNA library derived from the mouse retina 38 and appears to result from joining a cryptic splice donor site within the last exon of the -C1 isoform to an additional exon downstream. Both PSG16 isoforms lack the signal sequence and the N-terminal part of the N1 ectodomain relative to other murine PSG proteins (Figure 2 ). Both, like other PSG proteins, also lack any C-terminal membrane anchor motif. The absence of a membrane anchor does not necessarily preclude receptor activity: C-terminally truncated soluble forms of CEACAM1a were expressed on the cell surface, presumably by binding to membrane-anchored partners, and conferred MHV receptor activity on the expressing cells 34 . The N-terminal truncation is more problematic. Translocation in the absence of a signal sequence, though very uncommon, has been documented, but the PSG16 domain most homologous to the N domain of CEACAM1a is the N1 domain, which is missing the N-terminal MHV-binding site (Figure 2 ). An attempt to assess the MHV receptor activity of PSG16-4(N1*)C2 by targeting it to the cell surface with the signal sequence and membrane anchor domains of the avian retrovirus receptor TVA did not result in detectable surface expression, although parallel CEACAM1a and CEACAM2 constructs reached the cell surface and supported MHV infection 15 . Currently, it is not certain whether the chimeric PSG16 protein is specifically retained within the secretory pathway or simply dysfunctional due to misfolding. A third PSG16 isoform is predicted from analysis of the psg16 locus and placental EST libraries 39. This \"full-length\" isoform, PSG16-4C1 (Figure 1 ), contains both a canonical signal sequence and an intact N1 domain and can be amplified from mouse placenta (J.M. Phillips, unpublished observations); however, alignment of the full-length PSG16 with murine CEACAM proteins shows that the MHV-binding motif on the CC' loop has been entirely deleted ( Figure 2 ). Additional studies are underway to determine whether this novel full-length isoform of PSG16 could be an alternative receptor for MHV.",

The most common RIS assay involves overlaying a monolayer of non-permissive with infected permissive cells; for RIS-competent strains of MHV (chiefly JHM.SD and the highly lethal JHM cl-2 isolate 40), the infected cells fuse with neighboring uninfected cells, which fuse in turn to form large syncytia 41 -43. Neither the A59 strain42 nor the mildly attenuated JHM.IA 44 performs RIS, and the acid-dependent JHM mutant OBLV60 performs RIS only if the medium is adjusted to the permissive pH 45 . RIS activity depends on the MHV spike glycoprotein but is not blocked by CC1 45 . A similar assay has been used to study spread from infected microglia to neurons, although it is not clear that the latter truly lack CEACAM1a 15, 46 . Fusion also occurs among non-permissive cells expressing the spike protein alone and is blocked by anti-spike antibodies 45 . Taken together, these data imply that the RIS phenomenon requires only the JHM.SD spike protein.",

Several strains of JHM with mutations in S2 have lost the ability to perform RIS and are less neurovirulent than wild-type JHM.SD 48 -49 (J.C. Tsai, unpublished data), but many are also deficient in CEACAM1a-dependent fusion 41 , 50 -51, are less able to use CEACAM1b as an alternative receptor 52, or resist neutralization by soluble receptor (i.e. are not triggered by receptor binding) 53 despite wild-type receptorbinding domains, implying defects in receptor-dependent fusion as well as RIS. The same is true of tissue-culture adapted strains that lack RIS activity due to large deletions in S1 41. By contrast, JHM.IA, which has four amino acid substitutions in its spike protein, including one (G310S) that abrogates RIS, has a stable spike and retains full CEACAM1a-dependent fusion activity. Although it is less pathogenic than JHM.SD, JHM1A is still relatively neurovirulent in na\u00efve weanling or adult mice 44 , 54.

If CEACAM1a-independent spread in neurons is distinct from RIS, the next question is whether JHM uses an alternative receptor for interneuronal spread or whether the synaptic environment allows JHM to spread in the absence of any receptor. The former might be identified by screening for neuronallyexpressed proteins that interact with JHM S or confer JHM infection on nonpermissive cells; the latter is more difficult to address, but determining if interneuronal spread requires cellto-cell fusion or release of virus from neurites could suggest further approaches.

Mouse hepatitis virus is a coronavirus used as a model for both liver and CNS disease, allowing the study of viral pathogenesis of these organ systems in the natural host. The viral RNA genome is expressed as a set of seven nested mRNAs with a total of eleven open reading frames (ORFs) which encode two large replicase polyproteins (ORF1a and the frameshift product ORF1ab), three non-structural proteins of unknown function (ORF2a, ORF4, and ORF5a), and six structural proteins: hemagglutinin esterase (HE; ORF 2b), spike (S; ORF3), envelope (E; ORF 5b), membrane (M; ORF6), nucleocapsid (N;ORF7), and internal protein (I; alternative reading frame of ORF7) ( Figure IA) . The HE and I proteins are not expressed by all strains of MHV. The structural proteins assemble at the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), from which they are transported in vesicles to the plasma membrane to be released by exocytosis. The virus particles consist of a positive-sense RNA genome coated with N protein surrounded by an ERGIC-derived lipid bilayer envelope. The five remaining structural proteins are transmembrane proteins embedded in the viral envelope ( Figure IB) . M, E, and I have small extracellular domains; HE forms dimers that project from the envelope as small spikes, and the larger, heavily glycosylated S protein forms trimers that project as large spikes or \"peplomers\" that give coronaviruses their characteristic \"crown-like\" appearance by transmission electron microscopy. S protein mediates both attachment to the virus receptor and viral fusion with the cell membrane 2 . S is synthesized as a precursor that is cleaved posttranslationally by cellular proteases into N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 subunits that remain non-covalently associated 3 -4. (The MHV-2 spike protein, which is not cleaved by the producing cell 5 -6, is outside the scope of this article.) The receptor-binding domain of S is associated with S1 and the fusion activity with S2 7 -8. Although no definitive structure exists, MHV S is believed to be a type I viral fusion protein 9 (like influenza HA or HIV Env), meaning that fusion activation should result in presentation of the hydrophobic fusion peptide on by a three-stranded coiled-coil motif. Therefore, the \"fusion-activated\" conformation of S2 can be detected by aggregation or liposome binding. Comparison of domain structures of proposed mouse hepatitis virus receptors.
