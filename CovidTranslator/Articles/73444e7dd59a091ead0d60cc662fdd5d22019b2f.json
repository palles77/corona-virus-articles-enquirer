Though highly implicated in a variety of cancers, their involvement in infectious disease is less recognised. A growing body of evidence now highlights the importance of the ErbB family in a variety of infections. Their role as growth factor receptors, along with other characteristics, such as surface expression and continuous intracellular trafficking, make this receptor family ideally placed for exploitation by pathogens. Herein, we review our current understanding of the role of the ErbB family in the context of infectious disease, exploring the mechanisms that govern pathogen exploitation of this system.",

A central role in this coevolution is played by host cell receptors which can both recognise microbes and manipulate cellular responses to them. As such, pathogens have developed mechanisms to subvert host cell receptors for their own needs; the ErbB family is one group of host receptors involved in such a relationship.",

Following ligand binding and activation, oligomerisation of ErbB family members occurs [8] . ErbB signalling is then induced through phosphorylation of intracellular domains, resulting in the activation of several major intracellular signalling pathways, including mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase, nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB), phosphoinositide 3 (Pi3) kinase, and janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/ STAT) pathways. ErbB-associated signalling pathways govern a wide variety of outcomes, including cell survival, proliferation, cell death/apoptosis, angiogenesis, adhesion, differentiation, and migration/invasion.",

In this context, ErbB expression on epithelial cells, the primary point of pathogen contact, plays a crucial role. As membrane receptors, ErbB functionality and localisation make them well positioned to provide a direct point of contact and entry into host cells. Not only are ErbB family members regularly endocytosed during their normal life cycle, but pathogen-ErbB ligation [9, 10] and ErbB receptor signalling cascades [11] [12] [13] [14] can contribute to cellular entry of a diverse range of microbes. Pathogen-mediated hijacking of ErbB signalling pathways also results in prolonged host cell survival [11, 12, [15] [16] [17] as well as altered immune responses [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , which may, in turn, enhance pathogen persistence.

More recently, it has been shown that all three viruses are able to utilise EGFR (ErbB1) for host cell entry. While RSV [32,33] and coronaviruses [34] induce EGFR-dependent macropinocytosis, a nonselective mechanism of internalising large bodies of extracellular material, IAV induces lipid-raft clustering on surface membranes, resulting in EGFR activation and internalisation of both virus and EGFR [35] . Interestingly, lipid rafts are also important for IAV viral budding and exit from host cells [36] [37] [38] [39] . Newly synthesised structural IAV proteins, hemagglutinin (HA), and neuraminidase (NA), can assemble at the cytoplasmic leaflet of lipid rafts [40, 41] , providing a platform for nascent viral proteins to cluster at, form progeny virus, and from which to bud [42] . Given that EGFR localises at lipid rafts [43] , a potential role for EGFR during viral exit may also exist (see Outstanding Questions). Additionally, the intestinal bacterial pathogen Campylobacter jejuni [44] also requires lipid-raft clustering and activation of raft-associated proteins, integrin-b1, EGFR, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) for induction of filopodia formation and bacterial invasion.",

The bacterial species Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is able to activate EGFR and induce expression of Claudin-2, a channel-forming tight-junction protein [49] which results in gut epithelium invasion [50] . Claudin-2 activation during infection is dependent on EGFR phosphorylation, as evidenced by a reduction in bacterial load following siRNA-mediated EGFR downregulation [50] . An alternative mechanism targeting junction proteins for cell entry is utilised by Staphylococcus aureus. Cleavage of occludin and Ecadherin, following EGFR activation, facilitates transmigration of S. aureus through cell-cell junctions, and inhibition of EGFR activity prevents S. aureus migration through an epithelial monolayer [13] . Additionally, Neisseria gonorrhoeae induces an EGFR-dependent mechanism of b-catenin redistribution from apical junctions to the cytoplasm, resulting in weakened apical junctions and gonococcal transmigration across the epithelium [51] .",

Subsequent activation of ErbB2 and downstream Src-dependent signalling led to internalisation of N. meningitidis and invasion of target cells [2] . Additionally, the fungus Candida albicans utilises both EGFR and ErbB2 to induce endocytosis and invasion into epithelial cells [55, 56] . Reduced severity of oropharangeal candidiasis is observed in mice following treatment with a dual EGFR/ErbB2 kinase inhibitor [55] . Liu et al. also document ErbB2 activation during vulvovaginal candidiasis in humans [57] .",

            "text": "Another pathogen-mediated mechanism that promotes host cell entry may involve increased numbers of ErbB receptors at the cell surface. ErbB receptors spend the majority of their life span at the surface of cell membranes but continually undergo internalisation as part of normal processing. The fate of internalised receptors has important consequences for the cell. Potential receptor outcomes, following endocytosis, include recycling back to the surface (associated with proliferation), transport to other cellular compartments such as multivesicular bodies, the nucleus, or mitochondria (related to homeostasis), or being targeted for degradation (thought to promote cell death) [58] [59] [60] . Pathogens appear to target these trafficking pathways for their own benefit. For example, HCV induces the upregulation of host-derived Netrin-1, which suppresses EGFR recycling, resulting in enhanced levels of surface EGFR, EGFR activation, and subsequent viral endocytosis [27] , which occurs via virus-induced EGFR and host-derived CD81 protein binding [28] . Additionally, the ErbB ligand neuregulin-1 has been implicated in enhancing EGFR and ErbB2 surface expression during HCV infection [29] . N. gonorrhoeae-induced upregulation of several ErbB ligands was also found to coincide with translocation of both EGFR and ErbB2 receptors to apical surfaces, following infection. This disruption of normal receptor distribution within polarised epithelial cells led to enhanced bacterial invasion, and upregulation of EGFR-ligand mRNA was also observed [61] . Conversely, however, Escherichia coli-mediated disruption of endosome recycling leads to reduced surface EGFR, transferrin, and b1-integrin expression [62] . Additional examples of EGFR-dependent mechanisms of host cell entry include Chlamydia pneumoniae Pmp21-mediated recruitment of EGFR [10] , and EGFR-dependent formation of HPV type 16 (HPV16), Annexin A2 and S100A10 heterotetramers to facilitate HPV16 infection [31] . Interestingly, malignant tissue from patients with HPV-associated cancers often poorly express EGFR [63, 64] . Further understanding of the connection between HPV and EGFR is required to fully appreciate this relationship.",

While cell viability was dependent on P110d activity in uninfected cells, inhibition of this predominant isoform did not cause apoptosis in HCMV-infected cells, which instead succumbed to cell death following P110b inhibition [11] . Furthermore, evidence of EGFRassociated promotion of antiapoptotic proteins, myeloid leukemia sequence (Mcl-1), and heatshock protein 27 (HSP27) [12] , as well as modulation of negative regulators of cell survival, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and SH2 domain-containing inositol 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) [11] has also been shown.

Airway remodelling refers to the structural modifications of the airway tissue and can involve increased smooth muscle mass, subepithelial fibrosis, and mucous gland hyperplasia which contribute to airflow obstruction and impairment of lung function. Interestingly, hepatitis B virus (HBV) can promote immune evasion by inducing tolerance. Surface EGFR is upregulated on HBV-infected intrahepatic regulatory T cells (Treg), which enhances their immunosuppressive capacity [68] . HBV-infected mice exhibited increased numbers of Treg cells that expressed immunosuppressive cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-10 and TGF-b, in addition to an enhanced ability to prevent CD8 + T cell proliferation, a requirement for HBV clearance [68] . HCMV-induced latency is another interesting tactic providing immune evasion and is also governed by EGFR activity. During infection, the ability to induce latency-associated UL138, while suppressing IE1/IE2 lytic genes, was shown to be EGFR dependent, by the use of EGFR-specific inhibitors [69] . Additionally, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can utilise EGFR-induced p38/MAPK signalling pathways within macrophages to prevent proper antimicrobial macrophage responses, resulting in enhanced murine infection [70] . However, in contrast to these pathogen-driven functions of EGFR that contribute to infection, some EGFR-induced host protective functions have also been observed. One study highlights the requirement of EGFR in macrophage activation and function against H. pylori, where EGFR-deficient macrophages exhibited impaired T helper (Th)1 and Th17 adaptive responses, resulting in suppressed H. pylori-induced chronic inflammation and disease progression in mice [71] . Together, these studies highlight a complexity of EGFR functionality, which has the ability to both contribute to and protect against infections. Mechanisms for immune modulation are highly diverse and pathogen-specific, perhaps emphasising the strength of our intricate immune system and the specialisms of each microbial species. The observation that pathogens are able to augment cellular immune responses through EGFR signalling again highlights the importance of this class of receptors during infection.",

Several cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), lung, and colon cancers, are known to result from aberrant ErbB expression or signalling. Aberrations leading to overexpressed or constitutively active ErbB receptors [75] [76] [77] , overproduced ErbB receptor ligands [15, [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] , and sheddases that cleave ErbB precursor ligands into their mature forms [84] [85] [86] [87] , have all been shown to cause cellular transformation. Thus, it is perhaps unsurprising that several cancer-inducing pathogens have been found to promote ErbB activation, with evidence of cellular transformation being directly caused by pathogen-induced ErbB signalling. In fact, the ErbB signalling pathway has been implicated in a number of major oncogenic virus infections.",

Likewise, HCV infection results in enhanced surface EGFR expression [29, 61] , EGFR activation, and consequent viral entry [28], whilst patients exhibiting certain EGFR polymorphisms spontaneously clear HCV infection [91] . HCV-induced AREG overexpression in human hepatoma cells contributes to prolonged infected-cell survival, cirrhosis, and HCC progression [15] . Furthermore, EGFR, which can also be cleaved from apoptotic cells to shut down signalling [92] , is found in significantly higher concentrations in HCC patient plasma, in the presence of HCV and HBV infection [93] . Whether this reflects host attempts to curtail aberrant cell proliferation, or is merely a by-product of virus-induced apoptosis, remains unclear.

Interestingly, in this case, EGFR expression is commonly low [63, 64] and has been an area of detailed investigation. One explanation for the existence of 'HPV-positive EGFR-negative' malignancies could lie in the functional redundancy between ErbB receptors as well as an ability of family members to regulate expression of each other. Indeed, several studies have highlighted an overexpression of ErbB2 and ErbB3 receptors, or even ErbB3 dependency [94] , in HPVpositive cancers [95] [96] [97] , whilst Stindt et al. showed that HCV induced downregulation of ErbB3 and enhanced EGFR and ErbB2 expression on hepatocytes [29] . These results were reproducible following suppression of ErbB3 with siRNAs and suggests that ErbB3 can function to impact on the expression of EGFR and ErbB2 [29] . However, the presence of 'HPV-positive EGFR-positive' malignancies has also been observed [98, 99] . Together, these examples highlight an association between HPV-induced cancer and ErbB receptors, though the full extent of receptor contribution to such disease remains incompletely understood.",

As such, subversion of the cell cycle is a common theme where both cycle arrest and induction may occur [106] ; however, the effect of either on associated disease remains unclear. Indeed, not all viruses possessing the ability to regulate the cell cycle, such as IAV and SARS viruses, are particularly associated with oncogenesis. Further investigation into the precise requirements of oncogenic pathogens, leading to host cell survival and replication, and the role of ErbB receptors in this context, may provide valuable insights to developing more effective cancer therapies.",

Numerous studies have highlighted pathogen-selective exploitation of ErbB receptors as a mechanism that contributes to host cell entry, cell survival, augmentation of host immunity, and cancer ( Figure 1 , Key Figure) . Their cellular localisation, regulated mode of internalised recycling, and functional capacity make the ErbB family an excellent target for pathogens that require access into host cells in order to self-replicate. Several ErbB-dependent pathogens show the capacity to regulate the cell cycle to access host machinery; however, the direct effects of this on prolonging host cell survival or enhancing proliferation remain undefined. Malignancies do not occur as a result of all infections and suggests that there are likely other factors involved in driving cellular transformation during infection.",

            "text": "On a grander scale, the role of host ErbB receptors during infection is an overlooked aspect of disease which warrants deeper consideration. To date, research in this context has focused predominantly on viral pathogens, with much less detail known regarding bacterial and fungal infections. Investigations are also skewed toward the more prominent EGFR, and interest in this host receptor may be warranted as it is the only ErbB member to undergo ligand-induced internalisation, greatly enhancing its appeal for pathogen exploitation. However, given the functional redundancy of ErbB receptors, and their potential to regulate expression of each other [29] , it would be remiss not to fully investigate the role of all family members. With drug resistance increasing in a plethora of pathogens, there is an immediate and critical need for the development of innovative therapies that target novel factors. As such, ErbB receptors and associated signalling pathways may possess potential value as novel therapeutic targets during pathogenic infection. This notion is supported by a recent study which validates the efficacy of the specific EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib, in conjunction with a broad-spectrum tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Sunitinib, against a range of evolutionarily distinct viral pathogens [107] . Both drugs have FDA approval as immunomodulatory cancer therapies and would also be exciting prospects as novel antimicrobial drugs. However, toxicity concerns that include adverse skin conditions, diarrhoea, and heart failure, may warrant limitation of their use to treatment of more serious infections.",
