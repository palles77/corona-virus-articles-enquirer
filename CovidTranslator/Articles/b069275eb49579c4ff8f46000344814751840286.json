Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development has collected and analyzed data for new protein therapeutics and vaccines approved in the USA during the past decade. Our results suggest trends toward longer clinical and approval phases for the therapeutics, particularly for oncology products. In this Opinion article, we discuss various legislative acts and FDA initiatives that might improve the efficiency of drug development and approval. Furthermore, few new vaccines have been approved in the past 10 years owing, at least in part, to the lack of incentives for the development of the products. We predict that this might change in the future as government and industry respond to the twin threats of the global spread of infectious diseases and potential bioterrorism.",

This was a 22% and 16% increase, respectively, in the clinical and approval phases compared with those for the new protein therapeutics approved during 1996-2000. Orphan-designated and priority-reviewed products, which traditionally have been focal points for the biotechnology industry, showed the most pronounced trends toward longer phases: for both cohorts, the mean clinical phase increased by more than 40% and the mean approval phase increased by more than 30% between the two five-year-periods.",

Oncology products showed the largest phase length increases between the two periods: 79% in the mean clinical phase and 80% in the mean approval phase. The increase in phase lengths might be explained, in part, by the composition of the 2001-2005 cohort: the oncology biopharmaceuticals approved in this period included first approvals for two radiolabelled murine mAbs (ibritumomab tiuxetan and 131 I-tositumomab) that had special scientific, technical and regulatory considerations, and two mAbs (alemtuzumab, cetuximab) that were delayed in development owing to business issues.",

            "text": "The importance of providing patients with new and innovative therapeutics is unquestionable. To facilitate access, the FDA, in conjunction with the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, has developed various strategies to increase the efficiency of the clinical development and review process. For example, they have implemented key provisions of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) II of 1997 [6] and PDUFA III of 2002 [7] , the second and third of a series of five-year legislative acts that have modernized the FDA. These provisions address the need to improve the quality of applications through effective communication between the FDA and product sponsors, increase predictability of various FDA actions and develop standardized information technology to streamline activities throughout the process. Although the efforts are welcome, our results show that, as implemented to date, the improvements have not provided either a consistent or sustained effect. In addition to the increases in mean phase lengths for new biopharmaceuticals documented here, we have also observed increased clinical and approval phases for recently approved new chemical entities (NCEs) compared with those approved during 1996-1998 [8] . Specifically, the mean clinical and approval phases for 58 NCEs approved during 2002-2004 were 84.0 and 18 months, respectively. By comparison, the mean clinical phase for the 110 NCEs approved during 1996-1999 was 70.3 months and the mean approval phase for the cohort was 16.8 months. The FDA has recently examined issues associated with the recent slowdown in product approvals [9] and has identified targeted research [10] that might improve the efficiency of the development process for all therapeutics in the future.",

These firms focus on the production of influenza vaccines and vaccines for childhood illnesses; these comprised the majority of the vaccines approved during the past decade (Table 2) . By contrast to the therapeutic products area, there are few incentives to develop either new or innovative vaccines and this situation has resulted in a paucity of products for the US market. Of the 15 vaccines approved since 1996, we considered only four products (rotavirus, Lyme disease, pneumococcal and meningococcal vaccines) to be innovative, and two of these are no longer on the market. The remaining 11 'follow-on' vaccines represent incremental improvements in previously existing products, such as combination products that reduce the number of injections given to children or intranasal delivery for influenza vaccine, and increase the choice of vaccine products available for prevention of a specific infection.",

However, several major issues discourage Prophylactic vaccines are given to healthy people of all ages to prevent disease. The safety of the product is thus paramount, but the risk of adverse events in all people given any pharmaceutical product will never be zero. In recognition of this problem, the US National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-660) established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP), which became operational in 1988. The VICP acts as an efficient alternative to the judicial system for those seeking recourse, who allegedly were injured by a select group of vaccine products, including childhood hepatitis A and trivalent influenza vaccines. Innovative vaccines are currently excluded from coverage under VICP. Low return on investment also adversely affects innovative vaccine development. Vaccine research, development and manufacturing requirements are similar to those of therapeutics, but vaccines generally are cheaper and are administered in smaller and fewer doses compared with most therapeutics, particularly those for chronic conditions. Therefore, investment in vaccine product development is less attractive than that for therapeutics. Within the vaccine category, more risk is associated with the development of innovative vaccines compared with incremental improvements made to previously approved products. The emphasis on childhood vaccines during the past decade has occurred, in part, because the market for childhood vaccines, most of which are government-recommended and required for entry into schools, is well established and understood. Markets for innovative vaccines are usually less clear. The innovative pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Prevnar has proven to be an exception -sales topped $1 billion in 2004 -but the product is recommended for children and is covered under VICP.",

However, these are being systemically considered and addressed. For example, the FDA has recently introduced additional flexibility at the first phase of clinical development by permitting micro-dose studies, also known as phase 0 studies, in humans. This change should enable companies to validate a hypotheses based on preclinical study results and might increase success rates by enabling early identification of the most promising clinical candidates.",

            "text": "Although inefficiencies in the development of therapeutics have been slowly addressed during the past decade, it is the recent attention given to pathogens that pose a national security risk that has altered the vaccine development landscape in the USA. Both intentional release of pathogens as an act of bioterrorism and unintentional spread through travel and tourism potentially might result in high casualties and economic loss. As a defensive public health measure, prophylactic vaccines for priority pathogens, such as West Nile and corona virus, should be available. Funding for such vaccines, in addition to anti-infective therapeutics, has been made available through various US government sources, including Project BioShield legislation, National Institutes of Health Challenge Grants, and Department of Defense programs. To date, a few vaccines for priority pathogens have progressed into early clinical studies. However, more needs to be done to foster the research and the efficient development of innovative vaccine products. For example, expansion of VICP to include innovative vaccines intended for any age group and incentives for vaccine development intended for small US markets might encourage additional investment in prophylactic vaccine products. On a positive note, pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms with focused vaccine development programs currently have some promising new products. A novel rotavirus vaccine, RotaTeq (Merck), was approved by the FDA on 3 February 2006, and vaccines for human papilloma virus infection have either completed phase III or are already in FDA review.",
