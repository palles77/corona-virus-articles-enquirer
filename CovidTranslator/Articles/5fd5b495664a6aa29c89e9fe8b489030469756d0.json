COPD is the fourth most common cause of death worldwide, accounting for 5% of all deaths-an age-adjusted rate that has risen from 1965 to 1995, in comparison with those for cardiovascular disease and stroke, both of which have declined. The mortality of COPD patients admitted to the hospital is 15%, exceeding that for myocardial infarction. Risk factors for mortality in COPD are low body mass index, degree of airflow obstruction as measured by FEV 1 , exercise limitation, and degree of dyspnea. Survival can also be predicted by the PaCO 2 ( Fig. 24 .1).",

Airway resistance increases in the 4th-to 12th-generation airways as a result of mucosal inflammation, basement membrane thickening, edema, mucosal hypertrophy, secretions, and bronchospasm. Loss of lung elastic recoil is due to destruction of lung elastin and reduction in alveolar surface tension. Reduced elastic recoil decreases expiratory airflow by reducing the alveolar pressure driving expiratory airflow. Forced expiration increases alveolar driving pressure but also causes dynamic airway compression, resulting in no improvement, or sometimes a reduction, in expiratory airflow.

            "text": "In COPD and asthma, pulmonary hyperinflation has both static and dynamic components. The static component is the increase in functional residual capacity (FRC) that exists at the end of an exhalation that is long enough for all expiratory airflow to cease (i.e., 30-120 sec). This component of hyperinflation is primarily due to airway closure that occurs throughout exhalation. Dynamic hyperinflation is the further increase in hyperinflation that occurs because of failure to complete exhalation before beginning the inhalation associated with the next breath. The extent of dynamic hyperinflation depends on the severity of airflow obstruction, the amount inspired (i.e., the tidal volume), and the expiratory time. Thus, the degree of hyperinflation may vary with changes in tidal volume and/or respira- tory rate that occur in response to changes in CO 2 production (as a function of exercise, diet, fever, or the metabolic response to illness) or changes in dead space, as well as with changes in airflow obstruction that occur during an exacerbation. Chest wall hyperinflation puts the inspiratory respiratory muscles at a mechanical disadvantage, increases the work of breathing, and predisposes patients to developing respiratory muscle fatigue. Chronic use of corticosteroids, electrolyte disturbances, and/or other medications may also contribute to this problem. In COPD, minor reductions in lung function due to infection, cardiac failure, or atelectasis increase the work of breathing by increasing airway resistance, lung stiffness, and/or dead space. This may result in rapid decompensation with ventilatory failure, acute hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis as the tidal volume falls as a result of the increased volume of trapped gas and diminished respiratory muscle strength. during exhalation, use their accessory respiratory muscles for inhalation, are hyperinflated, and may develop right heart failure but only late in their course. In contrast, patients with a PaCO 2 greater than 45 mm Hg are generally more obese, have depression of their hypoxic and/or hypercarbic ventilatory drives (which can be worsened by excessive oxygen, alcohol, sedatives, or analgesics), have sleep-related hypoventilation, and are more likely to develop right heart failure early. Approximately 50% of patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD will be hypercapnic, a portion of them as a result of excessive oxygen administration. Acute exacerbations of COPD seem to result from respiratory infections (~50%) or cardiac failure (~25%). The remaining 25% may have retained secretions, air pollution, coexistent medical problems (e.g., pulmonary embolus, gastroesophageal reflux, and medication compliance or side effects) or no cause can be identified (Box 24.1).",

Plateau airway pressure (Pplat) should be measured by applying an end-inspiratory pause of 0.5 second following a single breath.

The advantages of a tracheostomy are that dead space is reduced; the endotracheal tube can be removed from the mouth or nose, thus reducing local irritation and sedation; and it facilitates suctioning. The disadvantages include nosocomial infection, local trauma, reduced capacity to cough effectively, and loss of natural humidification. Protection of the airway from secretions that accumulate above the tracheostomy is not 100% even with the tracheostomy cuff inflated. Appropriate reduction in time on ventilatory support with an awake cooperative patient, allowing for periods of some respiratory work to maintain muscle strength, is crucial before eventual cessation of ventilatory support and removal of tracheostomy.

In addition to expiratory airway pressure countering the effects of auto-PEEP, inspiratory positive airway pressure may counter the increased inspiratory resistance. Potential complications with noninvasive ventilation are patient-ventilator asynchrony, gas trapping (pulmonary or gastric), and decreased cardiac output from decreased venous return. Careful monitoring, similar to that of an intubated patient, is required.",

As in COPD, the consequence of delayed expiratory airflow in asthma is that the inspired tidal volume cannot be completely exhaled to functional residual capacity and a proportion of each breath is trapped, impairing the arrival of each new breath. As lung volume increases, expiratory airflow also increases as a result of increasing small airway caliber and increasing elastic recoil pressure. This enables the lungs to inflate to an equilibrium point at which all the tidal volume is able to be exhaled during the expiratory time available. In mild airflow obstruction, this process is adaptive because it enables required minute ventilation to be achieved at a higher lung volume with only moderate loss of inspiratory muscle power. When airflow obstruction is severe, however, the equilibrium point may encroach on total lung capacity. The hyperinflation is the result of both airflow limitation and the increased minute ventilation required to provide a normal PaCO 2 .",

This should be delivered with a short inspiratory time (VI \u2265 80 liters/min or Ti \u2264 0.5 sec) to allow a long expiratory time (Te \u2264 3.5 sec) to minimize dynamic hyperinflation. Either pressure or volume control mode can be used to achieve this. Volume control mode is more established, results in more reliable volume delivery, and is preferred by these authors. PEEP can be used to counter intrinsic PEEP, but the possibility of increasing lung volume further (as will occur if external PEEP exceeds intrinsic PEEP) must be kept in mind. External PEEP will only be necessary if the patient continues to have spontaneous ventilation and is unable to trigger the ventilation. Generally, these patients receive heavy sedation to suppress their normal response to hypercarbia when their bronchospasm is so severe that sufficient alveolar ventilation cannot be accomplished. Although some patients may require one or two bolus doses of neuromuscular blocking agents, these agents should be avoided if possible because of the concern for profound, long-term myopathy thought to occur more frequently in patients receiving the combination of neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids.",

If Pplat is low (e.g., <20-22 cm H 2 O) and hypercapnia is present, respiratory rate may be increased. Once asthma has improved, sedation may be reduced and spontaneous ventilation in CPAP mode with pressure support can occur. CPAP 5 to 10 cm H 2 O can be introduced to match auto-PEEP and reduce work of breathing.",

It occurs usually within 10 minutes of intubation and can result in severe cerebral ischemic injury and death if not recognized and managed appropriately. Most patients can tolerate mechanical ventilation with 115 mL/kg/min ventilation; however, a small number of patients with unusually severe asthma can develop life-threatening levels of dynamic hyperinflation despite this restriction in minute ventilation. In these patients, a 60-to 90second apnea test should be undertaken and ventilation resumed at the respiratory rate of 2 to 6 breaths/min. A common pitfall is the insertion of intravenous cannulae into the chest in the belief that this circulatory collapse is due to tension pneumothoraces. These procedures usually result in the complication they are seeking to relieve, and it is often difficult to know if a pneumothorax was initially present. Apnea testing should precede intercostal cannulae, and, if possible, incision with blunt insertion technique should be used.",
