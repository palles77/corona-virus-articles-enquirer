This work aims to describe PIV genotypes and their clinical and epidemiological distribution. Between December 2016 and December 2017, 6121 samples were collected, and submitted to viral culture and genomic quantification, specifically Parainfluenza 1-4 (PIV1-4), Influenza A and B, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) A and B, Adenovirus, Metapneumovirus, Coronavirus, Rhinovirus, and Enterovirus. Normalized viral load, as (log10) copies/10 3 cells, was calculated as virus Ct, determined by multiple qRT-PCR, as a function of the Ct of \u03b2-globin. PIV was confirmed in 268 cases (4.37%), and linked to both upper and lower respiratory tract disease, being more frequent in children than in adults (5.23 and 2.43%, respectively). PIV1 and PIV3 were most common (31 and 32.5%, of total PIV positive samples, respectively), with distribution being similar in children and adults, as was viral load. PIV type was correlated with seasonality: PIV3 being more frequent in winter and spring, PIV1 in summer, and PIV 4 in fall. No correlation between vial load and clinical severity was found. Novel findings were that PIV viral load was higher in fall than in other seasons, and PIV4, classically linked to mild respiratory symptoms, was circulating, in children and adults, at all levels of symptoms throughout the year.",

In addition, while it has been described in the literature that clinical manifestations of PIV vary depending upon the viral genotype involved, our findings do not support this. We did however find evidence of seasonal differences in the incidence of PIV genotypes: VL viral load (log 10 ) copies/10 3 cells, NT not typed PIV3 being more common in spring, and winter, PIV1 in summer and PIV4 in fall, with PIV2 being present at only very lower rates in all seasons except spring, when it is totally absent. These findings are in contrast to those of other studies where no such seasonal effect has been observed for PIV4 since historically this genotype was considered to only be associated with mild respiratory problems and as such was not included in the diagnosis of ARIs. Despite associations between PIV4 and ARIs having been proposed for more than half a century, it is not commonly included in clinical diagnoses, although some studies do highlight its potential virulence [23, 24, 25] . We, however, found this virus to be circulating among both pediatric and adult patients presenting with different types of symptoms across the entire period tested, along with other PIV types, with PIV4 occurrence peaking in fall.",

In summary, this study provides evidence that PIVs cause respiratory infections in all age groups, albeit that, as has been found in other studies, children are more commonly affected, and we also show that virus replication is more efficient in fall. It is, however, important to note that, at least in our study scenario, PIVs are not only related to mild infections, such as those of the upper respiratory tract. In addition, it was observed that PIV4, on which there are very few studies because of the assumption it is related only to mild symptoms, was not only frequent, but was also associated with lower respiratory tract infections. The results presented here support the notion that testing for PIV type could provide additional valuable information as regards the distribution of the genotypes in terms of age and pathology, as well as seasonal differences in these data.",
