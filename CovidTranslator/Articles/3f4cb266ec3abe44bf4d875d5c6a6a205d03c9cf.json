The aim of this study was to provide new information concerning the clinical relevance of determining nasopharyngeal viral load and viremia when characterising RV infection. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 251 children upon their admission to hospital because of fever and signs and symptoms of acute respiratory infection in order to identify the virus and determine its nasopharyngeal load, and a venous blood sample was taken in order to evaluate viremia. Fifty children (19.9 %) had RV-positive nasopharyngeal swabs, six (12 %) of whom also had RV viremia: RV-C in four cases (66.6 %), and RV-A and RV-B in one case each. The RV nasopharyngeal load was significantly higher in the children with RV viremia (p <0.001), who also had a higher respiratory rate (p =0.02), white blood cell counts (p =0.008) and C-reactive protein levels (p =0.006), lower blood O 2 saturation levels (P =0.005), and more often required O 2 therapy (p =0.009). The presence of RV viremia is associated with a significantly higher nasopharyngeal viral load and more severe disease, which suggests that a high nasopharyngeal viral load is a prerequisite for viremia, and that viremia is associated with considerable clinical involvement.",

They were initially considered to have little medical significance because they were only isolated in subjects with upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs), mainly common colds [1] . However, the more recent availability of modern molecular methods of viral screening [2] has led to them being identified in the nasopharyngeal secretions of subjects with bronchitis, bronchiolitis and pneumonia, and it has been demonstrated that they are frequently associated with asthma exacerbations [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

As they are shed in respiratory secretions for several days after the clinical resolution of an acute episode of RTI, their presence in the nasopharynx of a subject with acute RTI may only be due to prolonged shedding after a previous infection and is not proof that they caused the new disease [9] [10] [11] [12] . Knowing the importance of RVs is critical for deciding the need for new preventive and therapeutic strategies, particularly in the case of lower RTIs. It has recently been suggested that simultaneously determining nasopharyngeal RV load and identifying RV viremic cases could differentiate the respiratory infections in which RV is the real causative agent [12] . However, the published data are few and partially discordant, and no study has yet evaluated the two variables together [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .

Nasopharyngeal swab was used because it is the simplest sampling method for the identification of respiratory viruses without any reduction in diagnostic performance in comparison to nasopharyngeal aspiration and nasal washes. Moreover, it has the advantages of improved standardization in different age groups and between operators, and better acceptability in a wider range of settings [23] .

Plasma was obtained by centrifuging an aliquot of 10 mL of whole blood at 2,500 rpm for 15 min, some of which was used to determine RV viremia, and the rest for the other laboratory variables, including a white blood cell (WBC) count, the measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the preparation of blood cultures.",

The categorical variables are given as numbers and percentages, and were analysed by means of contingency tables and the chi-squared or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. All of the tests were two-sided and a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The data were analysed using SAS version 9.1 statistical software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). Table 1 shows that nasopharyngeal RV load was independent of all of the studied variables, including the demographic data, disease diagnosis, respiratory rate, O 2 saturation, the need for O 2 therapy, hospitalisation, admission to an intensive care unit, and the laboratory findings. The blood cultures of all of the patients were negative. The only significant relationship seemed to be the presence of RV viremia: the plasma-positive children had a significantly higher nasopharyngeal RV load (7.90\u00b11.07 log 10 cp/mL vs 5.15\u00b11.53 log 10 cp/mL; p <0.001). Table 2 summarises the characteristics of the patients with RV-positive nasopharyngeal swabs on the basis of their plasma RV results. In comparison with the patients without RV viremia, the children with RV viremia were significantly more frequently female (p =0.03) and, at the time of enrolment, had a significantly higher respiratory frequency (p =0.02), significantly lower O 2 blood saturation levels (p =0.005), required O 2 therapy significantly more often (p =0.009), and had significantly higher WBC counts (p =0.008) and C reactive protein levels (p =0.006). Moreover, nasopharyngeal viral load was significantly higher in the children with RV viremia (p =0.02). Table 3 shows nasopharyngeal RV load in the children with and without viremia by type of RV. RV was the only infectious agent identified in the nasopharynx of RV viremic patients, who had higher mean nasopharyngeal loads of all of the RV types. However, given the limited number of viremic patients with RV-A or RV-B infection, the only significant difference in nasopharyngeal viral load was observed in the case of the children infected by RV-C (p =0.03). RV detected in blood was always of the same type of RV detected in nasopharyngeal secretions.",

In terms of clinical relevance, we did not find any positive correlation between nasopharyngeal RV load and the type of respiratory infection diagnosed, but the children who were positive for RV viremia simultaneously had a significantly higher viral load and more severe disease, thus suggesting that the former is a prerequisite for viremia and is more frequently associated with greater clinical involvement. The lack of a correlation between nasopharyngeal RV load and the severity of lower RTIs has been previously reported by van Elden et al. in adults with asthma [13] . However, these data and those collected by us are different from the data published by other authors [14, 16] . Gerna et al. found that RVs were mainly associated with lower RTIs (in the absence of other viral agents) and wheezing in immunocompetent pediatric patients with nasopharyngeal loads of \u22656 log 10 RNA copies/mL, whereas lower values represented a probable carrier state in immunocompromised asymptomatic adult patients [14] . Similarly, Takeyama et al. found a significant positive correlation between nasopharyngeal RV load and disease severity in patients aged \u226511 months, but not in younger patients [16] . Finally, Kieninger et al. studied the bronchoalveolar lavages of patients with severe chronic respiratory disease and healthy controls, and found that patients with cystic fibrosis or bronchiectasis had higher RV loads in respiratory secretions than controls, particularly during pulmonary exacerbations, whereas asthmatic patients had similar loads to those measured in healthy subjects [19] . On the basis of our findings, it is possible that these discrepancies may be at least partially due to the different number of viremic patients enrolled in each study, although none of the previous studies simultaneously evaluated nasopharyngeal RV load and RV viremia.",

Current molecular methods are significantly more sensitive and, contrary to expectations, have revealed that viremia is relatively common in children with RV infection and is usually associated with a more severe course of RV disease. Xatzipsalti et al. detected RV in the blood of 11.4 % of 88 children with upper and lower RTIs, particularly during the early course of disease, and found that it was mainly associated with a significant increase in moderate or severe exacerbations of acute asthma [17] .
