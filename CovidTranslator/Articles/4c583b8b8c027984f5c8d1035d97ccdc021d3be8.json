Several delivery methods, such as intramuscular (i.m.) injection, intramuscular injection plus electroporation (i.m.-EP), and intradermal injection plus electroporation (i.d.-EP) were used in a murine model to analyze and compare the immune responses that were induced by the DNA immunogens. We found that i.d.-EP accelerated specific antibody seroconversion and produced high antibody (anti-PreS1, anti-S, and anti-C antibody) titers after HBSS1 and HBCS1 immunization. Combining the HBSS1 and HBCS1 DNA immunogens with i.d.-EP produced the strongest multiantigen (PreS1, S, and C)-specific cellular immune response and the highest specific PreS1 antibody levels. The results indicated that DNA immunization using HBSS1 and HBCS1 might be an ideal candidate, with its ability to elicit robust B and T cell immune responses against multiantigen when combined with optimized delivery technology. The present study provides a basis for the design and rational application of a novel HBV DNA vaccine.",

Although the hepatitis B vaccine has been in use for over 20 years, HBV is still one of the most widespread pathogens (14) . The most widely used HBV vaccine is a subunit vaccine containing the full-length S particle that is expressed by yeast or CHO cells (34) . The HBV vaccine is very effective for mass immunization; however, 5% to 10% of the population do not produce protective anti-HBV surface (HBs) antigen antibodies, and in recent years, the S variant strains have increased in prevalence (5) . The drugs that are currently used for the clinical treatment of hepatitis B include interferon and nucleoside analogues, such as lamivudine (5) . Due to the limited effect of this drug treatment and the adverse reactions to their long-term application, new treatments for HBV, such as therapeutic HBV vaccines, are clearly needed (5) .",

However, applying these results to a larger population does not work well for small-animal models, and a large amount of DNA is needed to stimulate an effective immune response (17) . Therefore, scientists are exploring ways to enhance the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines (1, 16, 30, 32) . Currently, electroporation is the most effective method for DNA vaccine delivery (16, 30, 32) . Electroporation increases antigen (Ag) expression in muscle and skin 10-to 100-fold more than a direct injection, which leads to increased immunogenicity, a more durable response, and a reduced efficient dose in sheep, pigs, and other large animals.",

After expression, a number of viral structural proteins automatically assemble into virus-like particles and can carry modified foreign epitopes without altering the particle's structure. For example, the widely used HBV and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines are virus-like particle immunogens. HBs antigen (29) and HBV core (HBc) antigen (10) were two of the first VLP antigens that were used to carry foreign epitopes (8, 9, 13, 15, 20, 23, 28, 31, 33) .",

Moreover, the HBSS1 that is expressed in CHO cells, containing S (aa 1 to 223) and PreS1 (aa 21 to 47), form stable, secreted virus-like particles with an equivalent molar ratio of PreS1 to S antigens (28) . The two novel virus-like particle protein antigens can stimulate fast, effective humoral immune responses in animal models. Protein vaccines have a long life cycle and a complicated purification process and are expensive. Moreover, they are not effective in eliciting T cell immune responses and usually require adjuvants. In contrast, DNA immunogens are relatively fast to produce, are inexpensive, and can stimulate stronger cellular immune responses than protein immunogens (16) . In the present study, we constructed two DNA plasmids that contain the PreS1 particlelike antigen, i.e., pVRC-HBSS1 and pVRC-HBCS1, containing the S and C gene sequences, respectively, as described previously (28, 33) . The routes of administration of the two DNA immunogens, with and without electroporation, were compared by corresponding cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. Our results demonstrate that an intradermal injection plus electroporation with a combination of core-PreS1 and S-PreS1 can synergistically enhance the effects of the DNA immunogen. Therefore, this method is a potential strategy for the development of a novel HBV vaccine with therapeutic effect.",

The peptides were purified using reverse-phase highperformance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to a purity of \u03fe95% and were characterized using mass spectrometry. The HBV PreS1 antigen-relevant peptides used were an 8-peptide array of 9-mers (GQNLSTSNP, STSNPLGFF, LGFFPDHQL, DHQLDPAFR, DPAFRANTA, RANTANPDW, NPDWDF NPN, and NPNKDTWPD). The HBV S antigen-relevant peptides used were separated into two pools of peptides: S-1 (VLQAGFFL, IPQSLDSWWTSL, and FLGGTPVCL, selected from amino acids 13 to 49 of S Ag) and S-2 (LLDYQ GMLP, GLSPTVWLS, and SILSPFIPLL, selected from amino acids 97 to 215 of S Ag). The HBV core antigen-relevant peptides used were a 4-peptide array (FLPSDFFPSV, YVNVNWGLK, CLTFGRETV, and TPPATRPPNAPLL). The HIV Env V3 (IGPGRAFYT) peptide was used as the nonrelevant negative control. The peptides (final concentration, 4 g/ml) were added to the wells with 100 l of freshly isolated splenocytes (100,000 or 500,000 cells/well in R10 medium) in duplicate.

The IFN-\u2425 spot-forming cells (SFCs) were counted. The results are expressed as the number of SFCs per 10 6 input cells.

This plasmid can form a stable VLP structure antigen in CHO cells and can stimulate an immune response after in vitro immunization (9, 28) . Moreover, the fusion of amino acids 1 through 42 of the HBV PreS1 protein to the C terminus of the truncated core antigen (aa 1 to 144) resulted in the expression plasmid pET-HBCS1, which can also form VLP antigens in E. coli (8, 33) . Therefore, in the present study, we used PCR and restriction enzyme digestion to clone the two PreS1 antigens into the DNA vaccine vector pVRC and to form two candidate DNA immunogens, pVRC-HBSS1 and pVRC-HBCS1 (Fig. 1) . The in vitro transient transfection of the 293T cells confirmed the effective expression of the two fusion antigens by IF assay (IFA) and Western blot analysis using Ag-specific antibody (Fig. 2) . CS1 antigen was produced as 20 kDa. The SS1 antigen was detected as two protein species (molecular masses, 24 kDa and 27 kDa), presumably reflecting both nonglycosylated and glycosylated forms of SS1.

No seroconversion with anti-S or anti-C antibody was observed in the single-dose injection group, whereas seroconversion with anti-PreS1 antibodies was observed in the electroporation group. In the pVRC-HBSS1 immunogen group, the anti-PreS1 seroconversion rate of the i.d.-EP group (5/6) was significantly higher than that of the i.m.-EP group (1/6 or 2/6). Immune seroconversion (1/6 or 2/6) with anti-S or anti-C antibody was observed after the i.m. injection in the double-immunization group; however, the amount of seroconversion was significantly lower than that in the injection plus electroporation group (3/6 to 6/6).

The mean antibody titers of the two electroporation groups were slightly higher than that of the direct i.m. group, and that in the i.m.-EP group that was immunized with both plasmids was higher than that in the group immunized with individual plasmids, likely due to the supplementary effect of the PerS1 antigen encoded by both plasmids. In short, these results indicate that the electroporation of a DNA immunogen can accelerate seroconversion and increase the level of the antibody response. Moreover, an intradermal injection plus electroporation is superior to an intramuscular injection plus electroporation, as it induces higher antibody levels and accelerated seroconversion with specific antibodies.",

The IgG subtypes of the antibodies against the S and core antigens that were induced by the DNA immunogen were mainly composed of IgG2a, whereas the anti-PreS1 antibody subtypes were mixtures of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b. There was a slightly larger amount of IgG1 antibodies than of IgG2a antibodies against PreS1, and the IgG2b subtype antibodies were observed in all of the groups that contained pVRC-HBSS1.

            "text": "Traditional vaccines are designed to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies. However, a number of intracellular pathogens, including HBV, can still cause a persistent infection (34) . In addition to neutralizing antibodies, the specific cellular immune responses support antibody production and are also crucial to the control and clearance of infections (5, 34) . Many immunological studies (34) have shown that strong cellular immune responses to specific HBV proteins (including Th cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes [CTL]) are detected during the FIG. 3 . Antibody responses elicited by HBV DNA vaccines that were administered using an injection or an injection plus EP. Each group of mice (6 mice/group) was immunized using the plasmid at either 50 g (i.m.) or 10 g (i.d.) in PBS three times at 3-week intervals. The antisera were collected at 28 days postimmunization, and the total IgG titers that were specific for the HBV antigen were determined using an ELISA and plotted as described in Materials and Methods. The symbols represent the titers of the sera from the individual mice. The horizontal lines represent the means (n \u03ed 6). The experiments were repeated at least three times, and similar results were obtained. acute phase of an HBV infection in recovering patients, but in patients with chronic persistent HBV infection, the cellular immune responses are very weak or undetectable. The animal experiment results show that the secreted Th1 cytokines, including IFN and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u2423), can eliminate a liver HBV infection in transgenic mice. Therefore, the simultaneous induction of strong humoral and cellular immune responses to multiple antigens is the goal for the development of a new therapeutic HBV vaccine (5) . Most of the therapeutic HBV vaccines in ongoing clinical trials have used envelope proteins as the target antigen, but other antigens (such as core, PreS, and polymerase) are also specific targets of the immune response during self-limiting hepatitis B. As previously reported, HBVc antigen contains multiple Th and CTL epitopes (9, 15) , and the HBc-specific cellular immune response might cause a self-limiting HBV infection (34) . Truncated HBc antigen-specific heterologous epitopes may be used as effective VLP vectors and can significantly enhance the heterologous epitope immunogenicity and immune response of Th1 cells (8, 20) . In addition, the HBs antigen that is expressed in CHO cells or yeast can self-assemble into 22-nm spherical VLPs and has been used to provide effective protection for the commercially available HBV vaccine (34) . A novel immunization approach, based on the use of a combination of recombinant HBsAg and HBcAg (which both form virus-like particles), known as \"NASVAC,\" is currently being developed for both the prevention and cure of hepatitis B (2). The vaccine was found to be safe and immunogenic, eliciting anti-HBc and anti-HBs seroconversion in a phase I/II trial (3, 6) .To our knowledge, PreS1 is the priority target antigen for the new HBV vaccines, because PreS1 has a greater number of immunogenic T cell and B cell epitopes than the S protein (9, 12, 15) , including a strong T cell epitope (aa 21 to 28) and an effective B cell epitope (aa 12 to 32 and 32 to 53). The PreS1 protein has binding sites for liver cells (aa 21 to 47) that play an important role in viral attachment and entry (13, 15) . Neurath et al. have shown that direct immunization with a PreS1 polypeptide (aa 21 to 47) can protect against HBV infection in chimpanzees (21) . Additionally, the PreS1 antibody is produced earlier than the S antibody, and the PreS1-specific cell-mediated immunity may help overcome immune unresponsiveness to the S protein in certain individuals (19, 24) . Therefore, the PreS1 antigen may play an important role in the neutralization, blockade, and clearance of HBV infections. In the present study, we constructed two kinds of particle-like structures expressing plasmids containing S and PreS1 antigens that contained HBVneutralizing epitopes and a C antigen to induce a Th1-type response. Our results suggest that DNA immunogens that contain HBSS1 and HBCS1 can generate powerful cellular immune responses, and the PreS1 antibody was indeed produced earlier than the S antibody. Furthermore, this response was specific to multiple antigens (PreS1, S, and C) and was biased in favor of the Th1-type response, as indicated by the production of IgG2a anti-C and anti-S antibodies.",

            "text": "The major current challenge associated with the use of DNA immunogens is to determine ways to enhance the response of the immune system (16) . Recently, reports (1, 30, 32) have indicated that in vivo electroporation can significantly enhance the cellular uptake of exogenous DNA and that the expression of exogenous protein can lead to the aggregation of local inflammatory factors. Thus, the humoral and cellular immune responses that are induced by DNA immunogens can be simultaneously increased. As a result, the effective dose of the DNA immunogen can be greatly reduced in the large-animal model (4) . Furthermore, many preclinical and clinical studies have indicated that in vivo electroporation is a safe, effective, and acceptable method in animals and human beings (7) . Therefore, in the present study, in addition to a conventional direct intramuscular injection, we applied two immunization methods with in vivo electroporation. Our results indicate that an intradermal injection plus electroporation increases the amount of specific antibody seroconversion. Moreover, small doses (10 g) resulted in humoral and cellular immune responses that were as robust as those achieved by high doses (50 g) of a direct immunization. Interestingly, we found that the core-and PreS1-specific immune responses induced by separate HBCS1 or HBSS1 plasmids were weak; however, a com- FIG. 4 . Subtype analysis of the HBV antigen-specific IgGs in mouse sera that were exposed to the HBV DNA vaccines. The antigenspecific IgG1 and IgG2a or IgG2b were measured using an IgGisotyping ELISA, as described in Materials and Methods. The mouse sera were collected 4 weeks after the 3rd DNA immunization and were diluted 1:100. The bars indicate the average optical density at 450 nm (OD 450 ) of the IgG subtype-derived mixed sera of each group. Immunization with DNA immunogens that contain the weak antigen CS1 and the strong antigen SS1 can synergistically enhance the cellular immune response. Therefore, the specific molecular mechanism that is responsible for this phenomenon deserves further study.",
