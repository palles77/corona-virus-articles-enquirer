Here, we show that at non-cytotoxic concentrations, these small molecules accelerate the deaths of non-cancerous cells infected with influenza A virus (IAV) or other viruses. In particular, we demonstrate that ABT-263 altered Bcl-xL interactions with Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (Bad), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), uveal autoantigen with coiled-coil domains and ankyrin repeats protein (UACA). ABT-263 thereby activated the caspase-9mediated mitochondria-initiated apoptosis pathway, which, together with the IAV-initiated caspase-8-mediated apoptosis pathway, triggered the deaths of IAV-infected cells. Our results also indicate that Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that sense virus constituents to regulate cellular apoptosis. Importantly, premature killing of IAV-infected cells by ABT-263 attenuated the production of key pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokines. The imbalance in cytokine production was also observed in ABT-263-treated IAV-infected mice, which resulted in an inability of the immune system to clear the virus and eventually lowered the survival rates of infected animals. Thus, the results suggest that the chemical inhibition of Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w could potentially be hazardous for cancer patients with viral infections.",

We tested the effect of ABT-263 on interactions between Bcl-xL and its newly identified protein partners in IAV-and mock-infected RPE cells. An SDS-PAGE analysis of immuno-precipitated Bcl-xL-interacting proteins demonstrated the differences in the protein compositions of IPs ( Figure 5b ). Mass spectrometry, followed by an immonoblot analysis of protein candidates, showed that ABT-263, in combination with IAV, displaced UACA and Bax from Bcl-xL, in addition to Bad (Figures 5a and b) . Thus, ABT-263 at non-cytotoxic concentrations alters the composition of Bcl-xL and perhaps of Bcl-2 and Bcl-w interactions in IAV-infected cells (Figure 5c ). Both ABT-263 and IAV activate caspase-8, -9, -3 and -7 to trigger cell death. 5, 25 We monitored the activation of caspase-8, -9 and 3/7 in response to ABT-263 treatment and IAV infection in RPE cells over time. We observed that a combination of ABT-263 treatment and IAV infection resulted in the enhancement of caspase-8, -9, -3 and -7 activities, and this coincided with a decline of RPE cell viability (Figures 6a  and b) . In IAV-infected cells, activated caspases cleaved their substrates, such as Bid, and disrupted basic cellular pathways and functions, which resulted in an inhibition of the transcription and translation of cellular and viral mRNA and a reduction in the production of infectious IAV virions (Supplementary Figure 3) . Thus, ABT-263 alters Bcl-xL, and perhaps Bcl-2 and Bcl-w interactions, and this activates caspase-8, -9, -3 and -7 to trigger the death of IAV-infected cells.",

Based on our results, we propose a mechanism of compound action in virus-infected non-cancerous cells (Figure 8 ). In our model, ABT-263, ABT-199 and ABT-737 bind Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 and Bcl-w and deactivate these cellular 'fuses' by altering their interactions with pro-apoptotic Bad, Bax and UACA in virus-infected cells. Bax and Bad dissociation from the 'fuses' mediate the release of apoptogenic molecules, including cytochrome c, from the mitochondria. Cytochrome c forms complexes with 'Bcl-xL-free' UACA, APAF1 and pro-caspase-9. Caspase-9 becomes activated in this complex, empowering it to activate caspase-3 and -7 which, in turn, activates caspase-8. Caspase-8 is also activated through a virus-induced FADD-mediated apoptosis pathway. Active caspase-8 cleaves Bid, and the cleaved Bid accelerates the mitochondrial caspase-9-mediated apoptosis pathway. Thus, the mutual amplification of caspase-8, -9, -3 and -7 results in a dramatic increase of the quantity and repertoire of proteolysed vital cell proteins, which potentiate the transition of the apoptotic process to the execution 'no return' phase of cell demise.",

The animals were housed in a temperature-controlled environment with 12-h light/dark cycles, and they received food and water ad libitum. Each group contained 14 mice. Mice were inoculated intranasally with 50 ml PBS with or without two LD50 of mouse-adapted A/PR/8/34 strain 26, 34 . 26 At 48 hpi, mice received the first oral dose of ABT-263, followed by two other doses at 12-h intervals. ABT-263 was dosed at 50 mg/kg in carrier (10% ethanol, 30% polyethylene glycol 400 and 60% Phosal 50 PG); an equal volume of carrier only was fed to the mock treatment group. This dosing of ABT-263 was based on previously reported toxicity study on mice. 22 Body weight was monitored daily and mice that had lost more than 30% of their initial body weight were euthanised by cervical dislocation. The survival data of the mouse experiments were analysed using SigmaStat 11.0 and the Gehan-Breslow Test. Statistical significance tests were performed with Student's t-test; Po0.05 was considered significant.",

The homogenate was cleared using centrifugation at 13 800 g for 15 min at 4 1C, and used for virus titre determination, cytokine profiling and caspase activation assays (described below). The left lobes of the lungs were fixed in neutral buffered 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, cut with a microtome and 4 mm thick slices were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E-staining). Slides were imaged using Panoramic 250 Flash slide scanner Hungary) , and images were processed to virtual whole slides and uploaded to the web server as previously described. 35 Biochemical assays. Cytokine profiling was performed using mouse lung homogenates or supernatants of compound-treated or non-treated, IAV-infected or non-infected cells. Cytokine levels were measured using mouse or human cytokine array panel A kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Membranes were exposed to X-ray film, and films were scanned. Each image was analysed using the ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). In addition, the levels of TNF-a (tumour necrosis factor), IFN-b and l in the cell supernatants were assayed with ELISA (PBL Interferon Source). Caspases 8, 9 and 3/7 activity were measured with Caspase-Glo-8, -9 and -3/7 assays (Promega). Actin, NS1 and PB2 mRNA levels were assayed with reversetranscription and strand-specific qPCRs as previously described. 36 Production of viral and cellular proteins was monitored using western blotting and autoradioautography. Briefly, RPE cells were washed twice with PBS and covered with 50 ml DMEM without methionine (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 10% BSA and S 35 methionine (Perkin Elmer, Espoo, Finland), and incubated for 1 h at 37 1C. RPE cells were washed twice with PBS, lysed in 2 \u00c2 SDS-loading buffer and sonicated. Lysates were loaded and proteins were separated on a gradient 4-20% SDSpolyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE; Bio-Rad, Helsinki, Finland).
