By day 18, he had a PRNT 50 antibody titer of 1:10 and a negative ELISA response; strong antibody responses developed from day 21 onwards.

We assessed how these factors were associated with the time from illness onset to commencement of the log-phase antibody response (Table 1 ) and the time for the antibody response to reach a titer of 1:40 (PRNT 50 ) or become positive in the ELISA (online Technical Appendix Table 2 ). An accelerated failure model was used for a more natural interpretation of the median time from illness onset to the aforementioned antibody responses (online Technical Appendix). Because the increase in antibody titers exhibited an S-shaped pattern, we assessed the rate of change in antibody response after the commencement of the exponential phase by manually removing data from the steady state, thus restricting antibody data to the logphase response ( Table 2) . A linear mixed model was used to test the potential difference in the rate of increase by the above factors (online Technical Appendix). Patients with severe disease had significant delays in the commencement of PRNT 50 antibody responses (Table 1 ) but had a steeper slope to the antibody response once it began (Table 2) . Thus, a delayed adaptive immune response may contribute to increased severity, and passive therapy with convalescent-phase immune plasma may be clinically beneficial. In avian influenza A(H7N9) virus infection of humans, earlier antibody responses and a faster rate of increasing antibody titers were associated with milder disease (8) , but in SARS-CoV infection, earlier antibody responses were associated with an adverse outcome (9).",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. First, no MERS-CoV isolates from the study patients were available, so MERS-CoV EMC was the basis of the serologic assays we used. Strain EMC is a clade A virus, and the outbreak in South Korea was caused by a clade B virus (1). However, using serum from naturally infected camels, we previously showed that clade A and B viruses and genetically diverse MERS-CoVs from Egypt were serologically indistinguishable (10) . Another study reported that isolates of MERS-CoVs circulating in Saudi Arabia in 2014 were antigenically indistinguishable from the EMC strain in neutralization tests with human convalescent-phase serum (5) . Thus, it is unlikely that the use of MERS-CoV EMC in our study considerably affected the observed antibody titers. A second limitation was the small number of patients studied (n = 17) and that they were followed only through the acute stage of illness. Longer term follow-up is needed to define the duration of antibody responses. If MERS-CoV antibody responses wane, as has been reported with SARS (11), this is relevant for interpretation of seroepidemiologic studies and for finding convalescent-phase donors with high antibody titers for passive immunotherapy. It would be useful to investigate IgM antibody responses and antibody responses to other virus proteins, including the MERS-CoV nucleoprotein, especially in patient L, who had poor antibody responses.",

Robust neutralizing and S1 ELI-SA IgG antibody responses were mounted by the third week of illness in most patients. However, a robust response did not occur in a few patients, and infections in such patients may be undetectable by serologic and seroepidemiologic methods. *Differences in rates of change and p values were estimated by using linear mixed models; positive value indicates a faster increase in antibody titer. Given that the antibody titers exhibited an S-shaped pattern, the analysis was restricted to data for log-phase antibody responses by manually removing data from the inductive/steady-state phase. Increases in antibody titers during the log phase were compared by different factors, adjusted for disease severity, by using a linear mixed model to account for repeated measurements, assuming a linear increasing trend by days since illness onset. PRNT50 titers were first log-transformed (with base 10). OD, optical density; PRNT50, 50% endpoint plaque reduction neutralization test. \u2020Effects were adjusted for severity.",
