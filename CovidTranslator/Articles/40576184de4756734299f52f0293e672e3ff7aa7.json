The full length cDNA of GuHMGR was 2330 bp with a 1518bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 505-aa polypeptide. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that there were two trans-membrane domains in GuHMGR. A molecular model of tertiary structure showed that GuHMGR is a novel HMGR with a similar spatial structure to other plant HMGRs. The deduced polypeptide of GuHMGR has an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.41 and a calculated molecular weight of about 54.7 kDa. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that GuHMGR had the highest homology with HMGRs from Pisum sativum and Medicago truncatula, indicating that GuHMGR belongs to the plant HMGR group. Expression analysis showed the similar amount of transcript level of GuHMGR in roots and leaves, suggesting that this gene was expressed constitutively in plants. Therefore, this novel HMGR gene would possibly provide a new strategy for studying the glycyrrhizin metabolism at the molecular level in the future.",

Usually, the roots and rhizomes of liquorice are used as sources of medicinal materials. Its major bioactive component is glycyrrhizin, which has the medicinal effects of antiinflammation (Matsui et al., 2004) and hepatoprotection (Van Rossum et al., 1998; Shibata, 2000) , etc. Glycyrrhizin also has antivirus effects, such as being anti-HIV (Ito et al., 1987) and against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) associated coronavirus (Cinatl et al., 2003) . In the meantime, glycyrrhizin is widely used in large quantities as a wellknown natural sweetener and flavoring additive because of its sweet taste. This many a day, glycyrrhiza plants used as medicinal materials were collected from wild resources. The everincreasing demand of glycyrrhiza plants has resulted in a dramatic decline in the wild resource reserves and the meadow desertification by collecting the wild glycyrrhiza plants. In the past several decades, the glycyrrhiza plants have been cultivated as additional resources in order to increase the glycyrrhiza resources. However, the glycyrrhizin content is far lower from cultivated glycyrrhiza plants than from wild ones.",

The series of enzyme catalyzed reactions suggested the glycyrrhizin biosynthesis pathway is a complex course. 3hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), catalyzing the conversion of HMG-CoA to MVA, is considered as the first step in the MVA pathway in plants (Chappell, 1995) . It is also considered a major rate-limiting step in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway (Bach, 1995) .",

The results showed that GuHMGR was expressed in all four tissues, which suggested that the GuHMGR may be a constitutively expressed gene. However, the expression in roots was higher than that in leaves, corresponding with the fact that the roots are usually used as medicinal material and more glycyrrhizin is accumulated in roots than leaves.
