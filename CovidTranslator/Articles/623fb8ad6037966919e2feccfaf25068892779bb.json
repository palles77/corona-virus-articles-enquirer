In many of these outbreaks, main transmission routes were healthcare facility-associated and through person-to-person contact. While a majority of existing work on modelling of the spread of infectious diseases focuses on transmission processes at a community level, we propose a new methodology to model the outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which must be considered at an individual level. Our work also contributes to a novel aspect of integrating real-time positioning technologies into the tracking and modelling framework for effective HAI outbreak control and prompt responses. Our proposed solution methodology is developed based on three key components -time-varying contact network construction, individual-level transmission tracking and HAI parameter estimation -and aims to identify the hidden health state of each patient and worker within the healthcare facility. We conduct experiments with a four-month human tracking data set collected in a hospital, which bore a big nosocomial outbreak of the 2003 SARS in Hong Kong. The evaluation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing epidemic models for characterizing macro-level phenomena such as the number of infected people and epidemic threshold.",

HAIs have become one of the greatest challenges in the modern world and a global threat to health security. Magill et al. [1] estimated that there were around 722,000 HAIs in U.S. acute care hospitals in 2011, and the [2] reported that around 75,000 patients deaths were related to HAIs. Among the different types of transmission routes of HAIs, the most important and common one is through person-to-person contact, or known as direct-contact transmission. Personto-person contact transmission takes place when there is a physical contact between an infected or colonized individual and a susceptible person such that diseasecausing microorganisms may be transfered. In many cases, due to the incubation period of the infectious disease or unawareness of the disease severity, the disease had already been spread through the hospital before the index patient was identified and quarantined.",

Assiri et al. [3] reported that, of the 23 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection identified in eastern province of Saudi Arabia, 21 cases were acquired by person-to-person transmission in different healthcare facilities including hemodialysis units, intensive care units (ICUs), and in-patient units. In the incident, Patient A with symptoms of dizziness and diaphoresis was admitted to a hospital. No MERS-CoV test was performed and this patient was not suspected of carrying this deadly virus at the time of admission. Another patient, Patient C, was admitted on the next day to the room adjacent to Patient A to undergo hemodialysis. Later, MERS-CoV infection was confirmed in nine other patients who were receiving hemodialysis treatments in the same hospital, six of whom had overlapping time with Patient C undergoing hemodialysis. MERS-CoV infection also developed in a nurse administrator, who had once been present in the ICU where the treatment of Patient A was provided. From this incident, [3] concluded that personto-person transmission of MERS-CoV can be associated with considerable morbidity in healthcare facilities and suggested that surveillance and infection-control measures are crucial to a global public health response.",

The 2003 SARS outbreak resulted in 8,096 confirmed cases and 774 deaths in total around the globe [4] , and 1755 confirmed cases and 299 deaths in Hong Kong alone (World Health Organization (WHO) 2003). The SARS outbreak began at the Prince of Wales Hospital (PWH) in Hong Kong. The index patient was admitted to PWH before WHO issued a high global alert about cases of this deadly pneumonia. Due to the unawareness of this previously unknown virus, the index patient was not treated as a carrier of a highly infectious and severe disease and SARS started to spread through the hospital among the patients, healthcare workers and visitors, resulting in at least 138 additional cases of SARS acquisition within the hospital (including at least 20 doctors, 34 nurses, 15 allied health workers, and 16 medical students) [5] . The disease was further spread to the community through the individuals leaving the hospital, e.g., leading to the outbreak in a housing estate Amoy Gardens with a total of 329 residents infected and 42 deaths [6], and became an epidemic threatening the world. During the outbreak, the governmental organizations (e.g., Department of Health and Hospital Authority) and public health workers put substantial efforts into contact tracing for effective infection control [6, 7] . It turns out that the contact tracing work was one of the key interventions that helped the Hong Kong Government successfully contained the SARS epidemic, e.g., through screening of symptoms and medical surveillance.",

A traditional way of conducting contact tracing relies on interviewing. However, conducting interviews may be ineffective because the patient is generally very sick to recall and talk about the past activities and contacts. Another way is to interview the healthcare workers to reconstruct the patients' past activities. However, both ways cannot guarantee the information is exhaustive and accurate. More importantly, these procedures require lengthy investigations such that prompt isolations cannot be carried out to prevent the disease from spreading.",

The project objectives were to mitigate HAI risk and to support rapid contingency responses in case of severe infectious disease outbreak. Our research team investigated how advanced indoor positioning technologies can be applied to enhance the person-to-person contact traceability for prompt contact tracing, and developed a radio-frequency identification (RFID) system for tracking people's interactivities (including those among patients and ward staff) and tracing highrisk individuals when infectious disease outbreak occurs. A pilot study was carried out in two medical wards at PWH. Our research team developed an RFID-based realtime locating system for this application. Figure 1 shows a screen-shot of the real-time locating system. For the details Fig. 1 The RFID-based real-time locating system developed for tracking patient activities of the RFID hardwares, we refer the reader to [8] . It is worth mentioning that the rare experience that the hospital management and staff members of PWH had gone through during the 2003 SARS outbreak and their suggestions were crucial when developing this platform. While our pilot study was enabled by RFID, other indoor positioning technologies are also viable. In our application, RFID was adopted because it is a mature technology and can be deployed at a affordable cost.",

However, such systems may raise privacy issues when installed in wards. In particular, patients' and HCWs' privacy is always a primary concern in Hong Kong. It is unlikely that HCWs and patients would accept an environment putting them under constant visual recording. Thus, a sensing method appeared to be more receptive in this study.",

This set of data provides the unique and necessary information to construct dynamic human networks to trace person-to-person contacts, and to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the ways individuals contact with each other in a healthcare environment. After the constructions of human networks within the healthcare facility, we investigate how an HAI is transmitted through person-to-person contact.

Traditional epidemic models, for example, [9] [10] [11] , assume homogeneous human connection (i.e., all individuals in the population are the same) and model the spread of infectious diseases with ordinary differential equations. As suggested by [12] , individual differences should be considered when modelling the transmission and designing more effective strategies to reduce the propagation of disease. For HAIs, the assumption that all individuals are equally likely to be infected does not hold, and therefore estimates from community-based models can be inaccurate [13] . Due to the importance of considering individual interactions, some approaches have been proposed to capture the impacts of individual differences using heterogeneous networks, such as the percolation methods [14] and the non-linear dynamical system [15] . However, there is inadequate research on studying the problem of individual-level tracking of HAIs, where most existing methods can hardly be applied to identifying individual infection status. The novelty and uniqueness of our research are as follows. (1) The contact pattern of patients and healthcare workers in a healthcare facility differs from the contact pattern of people in a large region, for example, a city, studied by a majority of the existing epidemic research. A healthcare facility is a relatively closed community with a highly hierarchical and modular structure, leading to dense human connectivity. On the other hand, a city-level population is sparsely connected.",

These differential equationbased models have been widely used for analyzing the spread of various types of transmissible diseases. For example, [22] studied the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and considered network heterogeneities in their differential equation-based model. They showed that their predictive scheme was more accurate than models that assume homogeneous networks. Percolation models utilize network degree distributions and epidemic dynamics to examine outcomes of disease outbreaks in the steady state. [14] showed that a large class of standard SIR models could be solved exactly with the use of percolation theory. This approach is more realistic than the traditional approach as it allows heterogeneous and correlated infectiveness times and transmission probabilities. Meyers et al. [23] applied percolation theory to reduce time-consuming calculations and derive different epidemic outcomes on a contact network for the city of Vancouver, British Columbia. Newman [24] and Karrer et al. [25] developed percolation models to study the transmission of two competing diseases based on probability generating functions. Volz [26] showed that SIR model can be represented by a system of ordinary differential equations with the use of probability generating functions. The result enables SIR dynamics to be modeled in random networks.",

He considered heterogeneous populations, distinguished by high-activity and low-activity persons, in their probabilistic mixing model. Teytelman and Larson [28] considered heterogeneous population where the individuals are different regarding their social activities, pronenesses to infection, and pronenesses to shed virus and spread infection. These attributes determine the rate of human contacts per day and impact the probability that a susceptible individual becomes infected. Yaesoubi and Cohen [29] proposed a discrete-time Markov chain approach to modeling the transmission of diseases. Dynamic optimization techniques can be integrated into their model to aid real-time selection and modification of public health interventions.

[32] studied network properties such as transitivity, assortativity and variation based on a large database constructing from the contact records associated 295,108 inpatients over two years. They concluded that the risk and adverse consequences of epidemic outbreaks might be reduced if these network properties are taken into account when designing the intervention schemes. Ueno and Masuda [33] constructed a hierarchical and modular contact network from a hospital setting. They showed that healthcare workers are main transmitters of diseases and shall be vaccinated with a higher priority. Curtis et al.

[15] constructed a time-varying network which follows an alternating connectivity behavior to model the day-night pattern of nurse shifts and derived a closed-form equation for the epidemic threshold with their network. In these studies, their main focuses were on the constructions of networks to capture the effects of human interactions on disease transmission. In our work, we construct timevarying dynamic human contact networks from real data and study how these networks can be leveraged for prediction of health status of each individual in a healthcare facility.",

In the context of disease, the terms \"symptom\" and \"sign\" are both used to refer to an indication of a certain set of medical characteristics that can reflect the presence of a disease, such as runny nose, coughing and fever in a case of influenza. Technically, symptoms and signs are different; a symptom is a feature observed by the patient whereas a sign is observable by the others, e.g., physicians. For consistency, we use observation to represent a symptom or a sign. The presence of a disease, in general, is difficult to be identified without the use of medical diagnostic tests, and therefore, the actual health state of a patient is often hidden. We define the terms observation and health state used for our model as follows. Our objective is to infer the hidden health states of each person at different time points. Observations and networks are necessary to achieve this goal. Observations provide the essential information for diagnoses of an infection, while networks give the information the set of individuals an infected person has contacted. On the other hand, they also impose practical challenges on the accurate identification of hidden health states of a person. Observations can be misleading since the same observation may appear in different health states. The networking effect complicates the problem in the sense that the health state of a person not only is dependent on his/her medical history but also can be affected by other \"connected\" patients. The challenges motivate us to consider the following overall problem, and the three sub-problems required to tackle in our framework. ",

We define a distance threshold and a time threshold to utilize the time-stamped locations of individuals to construct the list of temporal-spatial co-occurrence events for the establishment of person-to-person contacts. Individuals are divided into multiple groups according to their roles and attributes, and contacts are labeled with four types. We first generate static hierarchical networks based on the types of contacts, and then construct a time-varying contact network. Stage2 (Individual-level transmission tracking) We formulate the problem of individual-level transmission tracking with network-based coupled HMMs, in which the SIS model describes the transmission dynamics of HAIs. HMMs are known to have the power to recover hidden pattern from observable information, and shown to be effective in inference of health states, e.g., [36, 37] . Solutions are obtained in three steps. First, we give basic solutions to a standard HMM by considering all individuals as a single vertex. Then we derive solutions at an individual level by factoring basic solutions according to SIS dynamics. Finally, we reduce the computational complexity of the solutions based on mean-field analysis to speed up computations for large-scale problems. Stage3 (HAI parameter estimation) The problem of HAI parameter estimation is formulated as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). An auxiliary function is introduced to transform the MLE problem to a computationally efficient optimization problem. By solving this optimization problem with Lagrangian multiplier method, we can obtain the Baum-Welch reestimate and recover the original HAI parameters from this reestimate. This learning method improves the estimation of HAI parameters iteratively. Table 1 summarizes the notation used throughout this paper.",

Most healthcare facilities adopt a hierarchical and modular structure for the separation of wards and different roles of individuals. Interaction pattern differs between the intra-ward and inter-ward contacts or between the intratype and inter-type contacts. The time-varying hierarchical contact network naturally captures such characteristics in a hospital environment.

Trivially, we can solve the problem of s-step ahead prediction by substituting the one-step transition probability with the s-step transition probability. Here we introduce the pure prediction probability \u03c0 i t|0 (x). In pure prediction, no health observations are given, but the initial outbreak information is available. The health states of individuals are completely determined by the initial conditions and epidemic dynamics given by the SIS model. Intuitively, the effect of having no observation at all is equivalent to the setting that all individuals have the same observation at any time. Based on this intuition, we modify the computation for the detection probability \u03c0 i t (x) to derive \u03c0 i t|0 (x). We set the observation space to {0} and the observation probability \u03c6(\u00b7, 0) to one. By doing so, this tracking procedure becomes pure prediction. We calculate the tracking probability \u03c0 i t (x) under this condition, and we have \u03c0 i t|0 (x) = \u03c0 i t (x) with \u03c6(\u00b7, 0) = 1. Pure prediction is consistent with the nonlinear dynamical system (NLDS) discussed in [15] . The model reduces to NLDS when observable features of HAIs are unavailable. As observations provide useful information for more effective estimation of the health states, one-stepahead prediction is expected to give better performance than the NLDS or pure prediction.",

Indoor locations of the tracked objects were recorded every 3 seconds with a spatial resolution of 0.5 meter. We set the time threshold T th = 30 minutes and the distance threshold D th = 1 meter. While these threshold distance and time were chosen to illustrate our idea, our algorithm allows the user to specify these threshold values. We also note that the threshold distance and time depend on the type of the HAI. We constructed static daytime networks and nighttime human contact networks for each time period based on the tracking data; a time-varying hierarchical contact network of 240 time periods was then obtained. We considered the nosocomial outbreak of the 2013 MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia [3] for deriving practical HAI parameters. From April 1 to May 23, 2013, thirty-four individuals, including four healthcare workers, acquired MERS-CoV in three healthcare institutions. Fever, cough, shortness of breath and gastrointestinal symptoms were respectively observed in 20, 20, 11 and 8 individuals. As of June 12, 2013 a total of 15 deaths were related to the disease. We prioritized the observations fever, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms and cough, in a descending order of priority (from 4 to 1).

Figure 8 shows the fraction of infections at the steady state for different values of \u03c4/\u03bc on three static networks of snapshots at different time periods, G 1 , G 41 and G 62 , respectively. G 1 and G 41 have the same degree distribution whereas G 62 differs from them and is more sparse. The mean degrees of three networks are 15, 15 and 4, respectively. Although G 1 and G 41 have the same degree distribution, the underlying networks are not equivalent. As we observe from Fig. 8a and b, the simulated threshold effects of G 1 and G 41 are different: the curves of G 1 \"take off\" at around \u03c4/\u03bc = 0.5 while the ones of G 41 \"take off\" at around \u03c4/\u03bc = 0.2. Percolation gives the same threshold, \u03c4/\u03bc = 0.4, for G 1 and G 41 because it considers only the degree distribution of a network but ignores other Fig. 8 Infections at steady state on static networks.

ILTT-PD1, ODE-SIS and NLDS respectively denote individual-level transmission tracking with one-step-ahead prediction, ordinary-differentialequation-based SIS model, and non-linear dynamical system network properties. ODE-SIS gives the same threshold for three different networks because it assumes a homogeneous connection. NLDS captures the difference between the networks but deviates much from the simulation result. Our ILTT-PD1 predicts the thresholds to be 0.5, 0.2 and 1.2 for G 1 , G 41 and G 62 , respectively, which are more consistent with the simulated results compared with the other approaches. Figure 9 shows the plot of infection fraction at different time points resulting from the models for an HAI with infection rate \u03c4 = 0.4 and recovery rate \u03bc = 0.3. Since Percolation is not applicable for investigating transient states over time, we compare only ILTT-PD1, NLDS and ODE-SIS with the simulated result. The plots of infection fraction resulting from ILTT-PD1, NLDS and Simulation all increase rapidly at t = 3, whereas ODE-SIS increases at a significantly lower rate. As expected, ODE-SIS provides the same prediction for three networks because it does not capture the network structures. The simulated infection fraction at steady state ranges from 0.03 to 0.26. Our ILTT-PD1 provides a similar prediction to the simulated results (from 0.03 to 0.30), while NLDS has a significantly deviated prediction ranging from 0.33 to 0.54.",

We observe that ILTT-TR demonstrates an advantage over the other approaches and ILTT-DT performs slightly better than ILTT-PD1 whereas NLDS's performance is the worst. Their difference in performance is due to the fact that the approaches utilize different degrees of observable information. ILTT-TR makes use of all available observable information to obtain the estimation of the hidden Markov processes, while NLDS utilizes no observations at all.

If this patient zero has had frequent contacts with the others, the transmission path can only be estimated based on experience [3, 5] . Our method provides an effective tool to construct the transmission network automatically and accurately. For example, if we consider a person as being infected if his/her tracing probability is greater than 0.5, we can draw a transmission map of the hospital outbreak for the first month, as shown in Fig. 13 . 27 individuals in total got infected in the first month. The patient zero v 1 transmitted the disease to 4 other individuals and patient v 3 is a \"super-spreader\" who infected 7 people. This transmission map is similar to the one reported in [3] , a real-world hospital outbreak of the MERS-CoV. ",

Existing models, which are highly sensitive to the precision of HAI parameters, might produce predictions much deviated from the actual situation if parameters are not determined correctly. Our solution framework is capable of refining the estimate of HAI parameters in a step-by-step manner based on available information of observable features and human contacts. As discussed in \"HAI parameter estimation\", our solution framework learns the infection rate \u03c4 i and the recovery rate \u03bc i for any individual v i . Without loss of generality, we set \u03c4 p and \u03bc p for the patient group, and \u03c4 c and \u03bc c for the caregiver group. The following experiment illustrates the estimation of parameters of SIS dynamics. Figure 14a and b show the estimation of infection rates and recovery rates for patients and caregivers. The dashed lines indicate true parameter values while the solid lines represent the estimated values at each step of estimation. In Fig. 14a , the true value of \u03c4 p is 0.3 and the estimate\u03c4 p converges to 0.32 after 6 runs using the proposed method. The true value of \u03c4 c is 0.03 and\u03c4 c reaches 0.01 after 4 runs. From Fig. 14b , we observe that\u03bc p and\u03bc c converge very quickly to their true values as well. Figure 14c and d show the average gap between an estimate and the true value for the observation matrix and Fig. 14 Estimation of HAI parameters. \u03c4 p and \u03bc p (\u03c4 c and \u03bc c ) respectively denote the estimated infection and recovery rates for patient (caregiver) groups. \u03c6 i and \u03c1 i respectively represent the estimated observation probability matrix and state distribution the initial state distribution.

Even though we start with these initial guesses with fairly large average gaps, they converge to zero after only a few iterations. In contrast, Fig. 14d shows that the performance of the inference method is sensitive to the initial guess of the initial state distribution \u03c1. As the initial guess deviates from the true value gradually from\u03c1 1 to\u03c1 3 , the gaps between the final estimates and the true value become larger. For\u03c1 3 , there are oscillations and the estimation converges rather slowly but the estimate is far away from the true value.

Equation 2 indicates that a susceptible person gets infected if one or more of the infectious neighbors transmit the infection to him/her successfully. Equations 3 and 4 respectively state that an infected person recovers and remains infected independently. The SIS dynamics is shown in Fig. 4. The links between vertices represent the personto-person contacts. At time t, v 1 , v 2 and v 3 are infected while v 4 and v 5 are susceptible. At time t + 1, v 4 remains susceptible as the infected neighbors v 1 and v 3 both fail to transmit the disease to v 4 . v 5 gets infected because v 1 transmits the infection to v 5 successfully. v 2 recovers independently and becomes susceptible at time t + 1 , while v 1 and v 3 remain infected.",
