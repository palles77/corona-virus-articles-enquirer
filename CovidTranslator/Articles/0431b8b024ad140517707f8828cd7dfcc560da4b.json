Using isotope red cell tagging, it has been shown that red cell life span averages about 1/2 to 1/3 of normal in uremia. In addition, uremic erythrocytes have been found to be less deformable and osmotically more fragile when compared to their normal counterparts. Transfusion of uremic erythrocytes into an individual with normal renal function will restore the life span of those cells to normal. On the other hand, normal erythrocytes transfused into a uremic individual will have shortened survival. In the past, chronic hemolysis in maintenance dialysis patients may have manifested as increased blood transfusion requirements. However, these days such hemolysis probably more often presents itself as erythropoietin resistance (larger erythropoietin doses being required for a given therapeutic response). A variety of abnormalities (such as impairment of red cell enzymatic activities and reduced synthesis of Na + -K + pump units by uremic reticulocytes) have been suggested to be the causes for the heightened predisposition of uremic erythrocytes to hemolysis.",

Unfortunately, chlorine can react with other compounds in water to form undesirable byproducts (such as trihalomethanes). A growing practice is to combine chlorine and ammonia to form chloramine (a compound con-taining NCl groups and produced by the attachment of chlorine to nitrogen) and to use this chemical as an alternative bactericidal compound. Despite being much less reactive than chlorine, chloramine has been found to cause hemolysis outbreaks among dialysis patients in various parts of the world.

Similarly, reverse osmosis removes 99% of ionic contaminants, 100% of colloidal material, and 100% of microorganisms-but cannot remove chloramine. Chloramine is ordinarily removed by passage through carbon fi lters. Often such passage is adequate to prevent chloramineinduced hemolysis. However, if the chloramine-contaminated water is pumped through a carbon fi lter too forcefully the elevated water pressure generated can create artifi cial channels within the device-thus allowing the passage of chloraminecontaminated water into the dialysate. In addition, traditional carbon fi lters may not have enough capacity to prevent hemolysis when tap water chloramine concentrations are inordinately high-as in the case of drought. An alternative method of removing chloramine from dialysate is to enrich the latter with ascorbic acid. However, serum ascorbic acid levels should be monitored to prevent hypervitaminosis C and secondary hyperoxalosis. This ascorbic acid approach has not been widely adopted.",

It can also result from dialyzing against hypo-osmolal dialysates, as a result of using a faulty conductivity-measuring device. For instance, in 1994 (in a dialysis center) human error caused a central dialysate delivery machine to be switched to the \"rinse and water\" mode instead of being directed to the \"dialysate\" mode. As a consequence, several patients were inadvertently dialyzed with a hypo-osmolal dialysate. The affl icted patients developed symptoms within only 3 minutes of initiating dialysis.

This scenario most often occurs when the delivery of blood through the \"arterial\" needle is inadequate, as in the case of access stenosis. Kinking can be the result of the improper manner in which blood tubing is routed over a hard and narrow support, especially if easily collapsible tubing is used. Hemolysis associated with blood path problems is mainly intravascular in nature.
