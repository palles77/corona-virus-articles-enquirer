The exact reason for the sudden need for ICU surge capacity in Italy and whether this will generalise to other countries is unclear, but both demographic factors and healthcare system structure are likely to be important. Notably, UK availability of ICU beds per capita compares poorly with other highincome countries-including Italy [3] .",

Nevertheless, there are mechanisms by which ICU capacity can be increased in an emergency, including decreasing patient flow through reducing elective work or changing referral networks, and providing additional emergency physical capacity for mechanical ventilation (e.g. operating theatre ventilators). All of these require significant changes to infrastructure, processes, or sta ng and are therefore expensive and possibly time-consuming. Furthermore, the consequences for resources and sta\u21b5 redeployment are significant. Forecasting was therefore essential in guiding such di cult policy decisions in Italy [2] .

We assume that the daily incidence of COVID-19 can be modelled as an exponential growth (in line with what was observed in Italy [2] ).

We di\u21b5erentiate the cumulative model to obtain a daily incidence model i.e. we multiply by the exponent ( d dx Ae Bx = ABe Bx ).

We adjust by age and sex, which have both been shown to strongly correlate with mortality [9] .

Moreover, a persistent issue is that case ascertainment and timing after symptom onset is unlikely to be uniform between healthcare settings or over time as the surveyed population varies. Specifically, the shortage of available tests in the UK has led to stringent requirements for testing [16] . This would make our projections appear optimistic.
