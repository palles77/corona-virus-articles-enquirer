The aim of this study was to determine the innate immune mechanisms that underlie susceptibility to frequent exacerbations in COPD. We measured sputum expression of immune mediators and bacterial loads in samples from patients with COPD at stable state and during virusassociated exacerbations. In vitro immune responses to rhinovirus infection in differentiated primary bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) sampled from patients with COPD were additionally evaluated. Patients were stratified as frequent exacerbators (\u05462 exacerbations in the preceding year) or infrequent exacerbators (\u03fd2 exacerbations in the preceding year) with comparisons made between these groups. Frequent exacerbators had reduced sputum cell mRNA expression of the antiviral immune mediators type I and III interferons and reduced interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) expression when clinically stable and during virus-associated exacerbation. A role for epithelial cellintrinsic innate immune dysregulation was identified: induction of interferons and ISGs during in vitro rhinovirus (RV) infection was also impaired in differentiated BECs from frequent exacerbators. Frequent exacerbators additionally had increased sputum bacterial loads at 2 wk following virus-associated exacerbation onset. These data implicate deficient airway innate immunity involving epithelial cells in the increased propensity to exacerbations observed in some patients with COPD. Therapeutic approaches to boost innate antimicrobial immunity in the lung could be a viable strategy for prevention and treatment of frequent exacerbations.",

Acute exacerbations are a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality (9, 31, 34) and preventing exacerbations remains a major unmet need. There has been increasing interest in a recently identified subgroup of patients with COPD, who are at risk of exacerbations, defined as the \"frequent exacerbator phenotype\". (19) Patients with frequent exacerbations have worse clinical outcomes, including increased morbidity (31) , accelerated lung function decline (9) , and greater mortality (36) , suggesting that this group requires special consideration. To date, the underlying mechanisms that predispose such patients to more frequent exacerbations have not been elucidated.

The study protocol was approved by the East London Research Ethics Committee (study number 11/LO/ 0229), and all subjects gave informed written consent. The subjects all had a clinical diagnosis of COPD that was confirmed with spirometry. All subjects had an initial visit at baseline when clinically stable (infection-free without antibiotic treatment or treatment with oral corticosteroids for at least 8 wk) for clinical assessment, spirometry [forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF)] and clinical sample collection, including spontaneous or induced sputum, taken and processed, as previously described (22, 27) . At the baseline visit, all subjects were asked about the number of exacerbations experienced in the previous year and were divided into two groups: frequent exacerbators (\u05462 exacerbations in preceding year) and infrequent exacerbators (0 -1 exacerbations in the previous year), as previously described (38) . Subjects then had repeat visits at three monthly intervals when clinically stable and were followed up for a minimum of 6 mo. Subjects reported to the study team when they developed symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection or an increase in any of the symptoms of dyspnea, cough, sputum volume, or purulence. Exacerbation was defined using the East London cohort criteria (9) . Subjects were seen within 48 h of onset of their symptoms for collection of samples, and repeat visits were carried out at 2 wk after the initial exacerbation visit. Samples from this cohort have been used in a previous study investigating the role of airway glucose in COPD (23) .",

Following this, infection media were replaced with 500 l fresh BEBM minimal for the remainder of the experiment. Samples were collected at 72 h postinfection with apical media removed and stored for protein expression analyses. Type III IFN proteins were measured using a custom-designed LEGENDplex kit (BioLegend). IFN-\u2424 was measured using the Verikine ELISA (PBL). Half of the Transwell membrane was also carefully cut from the inserts and collected into RLT buffer (Qiagen) containing 1% 2-mercaptoethanol for downstream molecular analyses by RT-quantitative PCR.

Virus-induced exacerbation can trigger subsequent bacterial infection in COPD (13, 21) , a secondary phenomenon that is associated with more severe RV infections (21) and inversely related to the interferon responses (33) . Given that we observed deficient interferon responses in frequent exacerbators, both in vitro and in vivo, we hypothe- sized that this phenotype would be associated with increased secondary bacterial infection in exacerbating COPD patients. To investigate this, we measured sputum bacterial loads by 16S quantitative PCR in subjects with COPD at stable state and during virus-associated exacerbation. There were no differences in sputum 16S bacterial loads between frequent and infrequent exacerbators at baseline or exacerbation onset (Fig.  6, A and B) . However, frequent exacerbators had a significant increase (~1 log) in bacterial loads at 2 wk after exacerbation onset (Fig. 6C) , indicating that this COPD subgroup may have increased likelihood of secondary bacterial infection during virus-induced exacerbation and suggesting that this may be related to a deficient antiviral immune response during exacerbation.",

We show here, for the first time, that patients with COPD, who have a history of frequent exacerbations, have reduced airway antimicrobial immunity when assessed at clinical stability and during subsequent virus-associated exacerbation with an associated increase in bacterial loads. We additionally confirm that COPD frequent exacerbators have reduced ex vivo immune responses to RV infection in primary airway epithelial cells, indicating an innate antiviral deficiency. Our data provide an important mechanistic advance in understanding this clinically important COPD subgroup. These abnormalities could predispose such patients to greater risk of acquisition of pathogenic viruses and bacteria and/or promote a greater likelihood of developing an exacerbation following an infection. (17, 22) . Patients with COPD also have increased virus loads and enhanced exacerbation severity when experimentally infected with rhinovirus (10, 22) . However, defects in antiviral immunity have not been shown universally with other studies reporting the opposite effect of augmented ex vivo antiviral responses in COPD (1, 20) . The discrepancy between these COPD studies suggests that defective immunity may not be present in all patients with a number of confounding competing factors, such as disease severity and medications likely to have an influence. It is plausible that patients with frequent exacerbations might represent one subgroup with impaired antiviral immunity. Here, we report that expression of both type I and type III IFNs, IFN\u2424, and IFN2/3 mRNAs is reduced in frequent exacerbators at stable state, suggesting that these patients might have a reduced potential to generate protective responses to virus infection. In support of this hypothesis, we also observed that antiviral responses, including IFN\u2424, IFN1, and IFN2/3 and the ISGs 2'-5=OAS and CXCL10/IP-10 were suppressed during exacerbations in frequent exacerbators and that RV induction of IFN1, 2'-5=OAS, and Viperin mRNAs in BECs ex vivo was also reduced in frequent exacerbators.",

Despite a lack of difference in absolute levels of IFN protein by 72 h, the reduced ISG expression observed in frequent exacerbators supports a less effective IFN-induced response in these subjects. Our studies were limited by sample availability only allowing evaluation at a single timepoint. Bacterial infection is also associated with exacerbation in COPD with increased PCR-based bacterial detection at exacerbation versus stable state, suggesting a causative role (12, 32) . Additionally, virus-induced secondary bacterial infection has been reported in both experimental and naturally occurring exacerbations (13, 21) . We have previously reported that experimental RV challenge in patients with COPD is associated with increased frequency of secondary bacterial infection compared with healthy subjects (21, 24) , an effect that is related to virus loads. Here, we extend these findings to reveal that frequent exacerbators have higher bacterial loads at 2 wk following onset of virus-associated exacerbation, suggesting that this subgroup of COPD patients might be at greatest risk of developing secondary bacterial infection following initial virus infection. These data provide further justification for development of antiviral immunity boosting therapies as an approach to reduce secondary bacterial infection and associated exacerbation severity in COPD.",

            "text": "It is important to note that causation cannot be inferred from the results of our study. Although we found reduced antimicrobial responses in patients with a history of frequent exacerbations, we cannot reliably conclude that these abnormalities directly lead to inherent increased exacerbation risk per se. There are likely to be a number of additional factors that may be contributing to the observed differences and, notably, in stable state analyses, frequent exacerbators showed trends toward greater ICS use and were less commonly observed in GOLD stage 1 group. These confounders could contribute directly or indirectly to the differences observed, as previously reported (33, 37) . Therefore, we consider our study to be hypothesis generating and emphasize the importance of future larger in vivo studies to more carefully dissect the influence of various factors and definitively answer the question of whether deficient antimicrobial immunity underlies propensity to exacerbation frequency in COPD. A further limitation to our study is that the classification of frequent exacerbator was made from clinical history taken at study entry where all patients were asked about exacerbation history in the preceding year. We cannot exclude that recollection of these events may be inaccurate in some subjects. We were unable to corroborate these data with medical records due to the heterogenous nature of locations at which these exacerbations will have been reported and managed (self-management, primary care physician-directed therapy, or hospitalization), preventing a systematic approach to data retrieval. It is also important to note that a relatively short follow-up period was adopted in this study. Since exacerbations may be influenced by seasonal variation in influenza rates, a longer-term follow-up period may offer more accurate information. This short follow-up in our study makes it unsuitable for testing the hypothesis of whether baseline deficiency in antiviral immunity predisposes to subsequent increased frequency of virusinduced exacerbations. An adequately powered study with longer follow-up would be required to formally test this. Our study shows that subjects with prior history of frequent exacerbations have reduced expression of antiviral immune mediators, but it is not a prospective evaluation of this hypothesis. In a study with a much longer follow-up period (median 1,047 days), frequent exacerbators experienced significantly more coryzal episodes than infrequent exacerbators (18) , which supports that this phenotype is potentially associated with increased susceptibility to viral infection. Previous studies have also indicated that exacerbation risk in COPD is dynamic and may change from year to year (16, 19) , suggesting that factors other than increased clinical attendances (and, thus, Identification of an underlying mechanism to explain our observation of impaired antiviral immunity in frequent exacerbators is challenging due to confounding factors, such as inhaled corticosteroid use, making it difficult to determine immune abnormalities that are inherently due to disease phenotype. Previous studies have indicated that frequent exacerbators have increased systemic and local expression of proinflammatory cytokines (5, 11) . In the current study, we showed trends toward increased baseline production of inflammatory cytokines TNF-\u2423 and CCL5/RANTES, hinting that chronic airway inflammation could contribute to defective antiviral responses upon infection observed in some patients. A previous study in airway epithelial cell cultures demonstrated that proinflammatory cytokine exposure impaired epithelial expression of cathelicidin (29) , an antimicrobial peptide that has antibacterial and antiviral properties (4, 7) . Exposure to proinflammatory cytokines can induce persistent epigenetic changes that modify innate immune responses. IL-13 exposure of airway epithelial cells from donors with asthma-induced, longlasting modification of DNA methylation (25) . We have previously reported increased RV-induced type I IFN expression in NF-B p65 heterozygous mice (p65 \u03e9/\u03ea ) compared with p65 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice associated with lower expression of inflammatory COX-2 (2). This is consistent with negative regulation of IFN signaling by inflammatory pathways. Further studies are needed to investigate whether proinflammatory cytokines can similarly impair interferon expression in COPD and the mechanisms underlying this effect.",

Cell lysates and supernatants were harvested postinfection. A: IFN\u2424, IFN1, and IFN2/3. B: 2=-5=-oligoadenylate synthetase (2=-5= OAS), PKR, and viperin mRNA expression in cell lysates at 72 h was measured by quantitative PCR. IFN-\u2424, IFN-1, and IFN-2/3 (C) and CXCL10/IP-10 (D) proteins were measured at 72 h in cell supernatants by ELISA. E: cells were harvested at 72 h postinfection and rhinovirus RNA copies were measured by quantitative PCR.F: expression of viral pattern recognition receptors MDA-5 and RIGI mRNA was measured by quantitative PCR. G: transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured using an epithelial voltohmmeter with AC current through an electrode set placed in the apical and basal media. An average of three readings was recorded at day 21 post-ALI when all cultures were fully differentiated before infection. Data represent individual patients and were analyzed by ratio paired t test (baseline vs. RV) or Mann-Whitney U test (RV frequent exacerbators vs. RV infrequent exacerbator). *P \u03fd 0.05, **P \u03fd 0.01, ***P \u03fd 0.001, ****P \u03fd 0.0001; ns, nonsignificant.",
