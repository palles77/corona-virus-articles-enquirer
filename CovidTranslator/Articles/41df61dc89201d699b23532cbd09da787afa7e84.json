The results showed that GA treatment improved cell viability and ameliorated abnormal glutamate-induced alterations in mitochondria in DPC12 cells. GA reversed glutamate-suppressed B-cell lymphoma 2 levels, inhibited glutamateenhanced expressions of Bax and cleaved caspase 3, and reduced cytochrome C (Cyto C) release. Exposure to glutamate strongly inhibited phosphorylation of AKT (protein kinase B) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs); however, GA pretreatment enhanced activation of ERKs but not AKT. The presence of PD98059 (a mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase [MEK] inhibitor) but not LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K] inhibitor) diminished the potency of GA for improving viability of glutamate-exposed DPC12 cells. These results indicated that ERKs and mitochondriarelated pathways are essential for the neuroprotective effect of GA against glutamate-induced toxicity in DPC12 cells. The present study provides experimental evidence supporting GA as a potential therapeutic agent for use in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",

Our results showed that GA improved cell viability and restored mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation. GA also normalized the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, including Bcl-2, Bax, cleaved caspase 3, and cytochrome C (Cyto C). Furthermore, GA pretreatment remarkably enhanced phosphorylation of ERKs but not AKT. Collectively, our findings demonstrated that ERKs and mitochondriarelated pathways are essential for GA-mediated neuroprotection against glutamate-induced toxicity in DPC12 cells. This study provides evidence that supports the use of GA as a potential therapeutic agent for neurodegenerative diseases.",

            "text": "On the other hand, growing experimental evidence indicates that mitochondrial function plays a central role in cell apoptosis (28) . Results revealed that GA restored mitochondrial dysfunction, suppressed expression of Bax and cleaved caspase 3, enhanced expression of Bcl-2, and inhibited Cyto C release compared to glutamatetreated cells. Bcl-2 family members play crucial roles in regulating cell death, and the ratio Bcl-2/Bax is considered a hallmark for determining the relationship between cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction (29) . It is believed that when MMP dissipation is observed, release of Cyto C from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm is enhanced. Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that play pivotal roles in mediating neuronal apoptosis and neurodegeneration (30) . As a critical apoptosis executioner, caspase 3 becomes activated in the cytosol and is translocated into the nucleus to cleave its nuclear substrates (31) . Disruption of MMP unleashes the enzymatic apoptotic machinery of caspases, and of caspase 3 in particular, which executes apoptosis. Thus, it is not surprising that mitochondria-related pathways are involved in GA-mediated neuroprotection. Additionally, as reported, inhibition of ERK leads to downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression (32) . However, the relationship between ERK activation and mitochondrial function needs further study.",

The data suggested that 6.25 mM GA had a more potent effect. Interestingly, recent research reported that GA exerts an apoptotic effect in WEHI-3 mouse leukemia cells (33) and against DMH-induced colon carcinogenesis in Wistar rats (34) . It appears that GA possesses biphasic properties, that is, GA shows protective activities in neurodegenerative diseases and neural injury, whereas it has apoptotic effects in cancer. The biphasic properties may also be related to the dosages employed. Detailed mechanisms underlying such biphasic effects deserve further study.",

            "text": "ERKs but not the AKT pathway were involved in the glycyrrhizic acid (GA)-mediated neuroprotective effect against glutamate-induced differentiated PC12 cell damage. A, B, Differentiated PC12 cells were treated with 6.25 mM GA or 20 mM glutamate (Glu) alone and collected at 0, 30, 60, 180, and 360 min. In co-treatment, following pretreatment with 6.25 mM GA for 3 h, cells were collected at 0, 30, 60, 180, and 360 min after Glu exposure. The expressions of P-ERKs, T-ERKs, P-AKT, T-AKT were detected by Western blot. Quantification data were normalized by related T-ERKs and T-AKT, respectively. C, D, Protective effects of GA against Glu on cell viability were abolished significantly by PD98059 but not by LY294002 pretreatment. Differentiated PC12 cells were pretreated with 10 mM PD98059 or LY294002 for 30 min, followed by treatment with 6.25 mM GA for 3 h and exposure to 20 mM Glu for 24 h. Cells were then collected for measurement of cell viability using the MTT method. ERKs: extracellular signal-regulated kinases; AKT: protein kinase B; P-ERKs: phospho-ERKs; T-ERKs: total-ERKs; P-AKT: phosphor-AKT; T-AKT: total-AKT. Data are reported as a percentage (mean\u00b1SD) of that from corresponding control cells (n=3). # P,0.05, ## P,0.01, ### P,0.001 vs control cells; **P,0.01 vs Glu-treated cells; $ P,0.05 vs GA and Glu co-treated cells (one-way ANOVA followed by Dunn9s test).",
