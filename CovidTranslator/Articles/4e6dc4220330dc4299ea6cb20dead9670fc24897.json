At the same time, the I7L proteinase exemplifies several interesting challenges from the rational drug design perspective. In the absence of a published I7L X-ray structure, we have built a detailed 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site (S2-S2 0 pocket) based on exceptionally high structural conservation of this site in proteases of the ULP family. The accuracy and limitations of this model were assessed through comparative analysis of available X-ray structures of ULPs, as well as energy based conformational modeling. The 3D model of the I7L ligand binding site was used to perform covalent docking and VLS of a comprehensive library of about 230,000 available ketone and aldehyde compounds. Out of 456 predicted ligands, 97 inhibitors of I7L proteinase activity were confirmed in biochemical assays (*20% overall hit rate). These experimental results both validate our I7L ligand binding model and provide initial leads for rational optimization of poxvirus I7L proteinase inhibitors. Thus, fragments predicted to bind in the prime portion of the active site can be combined with fragments on non-prime side to yield compounds with improved activity and specificity.",

This requirement is especially relevant for the I7L active site, enclosed in a tight channel.

Comparative modeling above suggests no significant deviations for the I7L ''core'' binding site side chains from their conformations in the Ulp1 model. The refinement was performed to verify that conformations of these five residues are compatible with the adjacent residues of the I7L model and binding of the peptide substrate. Our results show very good convergence of the refinement procedure, so that the models from three independent runs had RMSD not exceeding 0.6 \u00c5 when the heavy atoms of the optimized 15 residues were compared. The ICM Protein Health tool shows no significant clashes in these 15 residues of the model. The five ''core'' residues in the model had conformations within 0.2 \u00c5 RMSD from the corresponding Ulp1 residues.

In the case of I7L and other ULPs strong covalent binding of ligand is especially important, because it has to compete with strong substrate binding, reinforced by large protein-protein interface (see Fig. 2d ). In the Ulp1-substrate complex, this substrate recognition interface decoupled from the active site, amounts to *1,900 \u00c5 2 . While a number of new promising warheads have been introduced recently [21] , ketones are still considered optimal due to their moderate warhead reactivity, proven ADME/Tox profiles, and good chemical tractability Also, ketones are among the few warheads suitable for targeting both primed and non-primed sub-sites simultaneously, which is critical for optimization of binding specificity for I7L inhibitors.",

Though such fragment based design strategy requires expensive de-novo synthesis, it is likely to bring about 2nd generation I7L inhibitors with significantly improved affinity and specificity.",

A modified ICM covalent docking procedure was implemented to reflect the covalent nature of ketone inhibitor binding to the I7L active site thiol. About 450 candidate inhibitors of I7L were selected in this work from 230,000 available ketones and aldehydes. Biochemical assays confirmed I7L inhibition for 97 of these candidates (*21% success rate), some with activity better than 20 lM. These results provide validation for both the I7L model and the covalent docking procedure, as well as extensive QSAR for hit optimization. Further improvement in activity and specificity can be achieved for ligands combining various ''primed'' and non-primed moieties, identified in this work.",
