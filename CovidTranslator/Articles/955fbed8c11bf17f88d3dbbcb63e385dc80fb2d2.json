Its methodological challenges include developing metrics for environmental features affecting patients' perception, mood, and stress levels.

Ulrich found that post-cholecystectomy patients whose hospital windows offered a treetop view had shorter length of stay, more positive evaluations in nurses' notes, and lower analgesic intake than comparable patients whose windows faced a brick wall. 7 The preference for nature views is hardly surprising, but the credible correlation between beliefs that environmentalists and architects held intuitively and measurable markers of medical outcomes was something new. Kirk Hamilton describes the paper's reception as a conceptual watershed: \"The blockbuster info was [that] this reduced length of stay and cut the use of expensive analgesics. Suddenly, this sort of touchy-feely California idea had been tied to very important quantitative information that was meaningful to management and clinicians.\" Some comments on EBD have critiqued the field's researchers for leaning too heavily on n\u03ed1 sample sizes. 8 Reports on some environmental effects, such as a Pittsburgh ED team's 1991 observation that playing patient-selected music during uncomplicated laceration repair was associated with lower pain scores, 9 could strike different observers as reasonable, obvious, or merely curious.

By 1998, the field had matured enough for meta-analyses of the rigor of published studies: Rubin and colleagues at Johns Hopkins identified 85 EBD reports that met basic criteria for scientific rigor (eg, study designs using randomization) and concluded that 80% of these studies found positive associations between environmental variables and patient outcomes. 10 In 2003 Hamilton was the first author to publish a formal definition: \"Evidence-based design is a process for the conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best evidence from research and practice in making critical decisions, together with an informed client, about the design of each individual and unique project.\" 11 (The similarities to the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine's generic definition as articulated by Sackett are intentional, Hamilton reports. ) Hamilton acknowledges that the term is easy to use loosely. \"If somebody says, 'Oh, well, what are the evidence-based projects?' the honest answer is 'Well, there may not be as many as you would think.' There have been evidence-based concepts embedded into projects, but who can say whether a project really is evidence-based or not? If you make one decision, like choosing a carpet on the basis of a flame-spread rating that Underwriters Lab has researched, is that enough? Many would say no, that's standard practice. If you've got an NIH grant or NSF grant to spend millions researching virtually everything, and had experts from around the world consult with you on all the decisions, everybody would agree, 'Yeah, that's an evidencebased project.'\"",

The ED is no longer a back-of-house component of today's hospitals; for many patients it is the front door.

Ambulance access, says Crispino, requires an unobstructed path and dropoff point capacity 30 to 50% beyond normal levels to handle surges. Since EMTs may take brief breaks after a delivery-sometimes leaving vehicles running to keep defibrillator batteries charged, holding up queues and letting exhaust fumes into the ED-his group designs entry areas with looping driveways, separate ambulance parking, and remote power outlets. This system, developed for Mercy Fitzgerald Hospital in Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, in the late 1990s, speeds ambulance bay turnover for a minimal up-front expense on asphalt and electrical lines.",

Bedside registration, 12, 13, 14 which Crispino estimates is now used in 50-60% of the nation's EDs, can shorten time to evaluation and reduce departures without treatment. The California Emergency Physicians group assigns a physician's assistant to triage lower acuity cases; this rapid evaluation process has achieved an average systemwide time to provider of 42 minutes (one hospital cut this figure to 8). \"You can discharge sometimes anywhere from 20 to 40 patients from triage without ever getting to a room,\" says Rivas. Universal or \"acuity-adaptable\" rooms, requiring minimal reconfiguration for different clinical situations, minimize transfer between specialty areas, saving labor and reducing infectivity. Admission delays remain the most important cause of overflows; since \"the ED is considered the only infinitely expansible space in the hospital,\" as Smith comments, design analysis should view congestion and diversion as \"not an ED problem, [but] a whole-hospital problem.\"",

Yet the bad behavior is not exhibited in the ED. Why? It's almost a tacit compact: bad behavior is checked at the door in exchange for this agreement that the physician, nurse, the whole health care system is going to work in the best interests of that patient.\" He cites the \"broken windows\" argument of sociologists James Q. Wilson and George Kelling 15 -the idea that well-maintained, orderly public spaces deter both petty crime and more violent behavior-as a strong rationale connecting physical and aesthetic signals to the maintenance of that tacit compact. Smith also admires the optimistic flip side of the Wilson-Kelling thesis, a principle articulated by British-Russian architect Berthold Lubetkin, designer of the 1938 Finsbury Health Centre: \"Nothing is too good for ordinary people.\"",

I like to say 'No one has yet done a serious, scientifically valid study on a building that you haven't built yet.'\" Since architects' work has the peculiar property of existing in the future tense, and since every commission presents site-specific demands, there is little risk that EBD will result in one-size-fits-all facilities.",
