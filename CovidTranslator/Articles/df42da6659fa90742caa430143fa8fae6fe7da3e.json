            "text": "This paper combines two advances to detect MERS-CoV, the causative agent of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, that have emerged over the past few years from the new field of \"synthetic biology\". Both are based on an older concept, where molecular beacons are used as the downstream detection of viral RNA in biological mixtures followed by reverse transcription PCR amplification. The first advance exploits the artificially expanded genetic information systems (AEGIS). AEGIS adds nucleotides to the four found in standard DNA and RNA (xNA); AEGIS nucleotides pair orthogonally to the A:T and G:C pairs. Placing AEGIS components in the stems of molecular beacons is shown to lower noise by preventing unwanted stem invasion by adventitious natural xNA. This should improve the signal-to-noise ratio of molecular beacons operating in complex biological mixtures. The second advance introduces a nicking enzyme that allows a single target molecule to activate more than one beacon, allowing \"signal amplification\". Combining these technologies in primers with components of a self-avoiding molecular recognition system (SAMRS), we detect 50 copies of MERS-CoV RNA in a multiplexed respiratory virus panel by generating fluorescence signal visible to human eye and/or camera.",

These generally use real-time RT-PCR amplification. For positive diagnosis of a MERS-CoV infection, amplification and detection of two different genomic targets is required, or sequencing that confirms a single target amplicon (http://www.who.int/ csr/disease/coronavirus infections/case definition/en/). Culturing MERS-CoV from respiratory tract, blood, urine, or stool samples remains an option, although virus culturing is cumbersome, hazardous, and requires experienced staff to interpret cytopathic effects in host cells. Serological assays for detection of specific neutralizing anti-MERS-CoV antibodies are not ideal for early diagnosis and containment of the spread of the outbreaks. Therefore, RT-PCR based diagnostics still remains to be the most common detection method (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007; Chan et al., 2015) .",

These require short incubation times, and are highly sensitive and specific, making them useful where no PCR equipment is available or operable. Components of AEGIS that, by rearranging hydrogen-bonding patterns on the nucleobases, adds six nucleotides to the four standard nucleotides. The Z:P pair was used in this assay. (B) Target DNA amplicon and complementary molecular beacon loop contains the recognition sequence of a nicking enzyme (Nt.BsmAI). When the target strand hybridizes to loop of the beacon, a full nicking enzyme recognition site forms where only MB is cut. After nicking enzyme cuts the beacon, hybrid strand becomes unstable and cleaved beacon dissociates from the target. Freed target strand can then be substrate for another molecular beacon to initiate the second cycle of cleavage thereby allowing exponential signal amplification.

SAMRS nucleotides are designed not to interact with each other. Thus, SAMRS oligonucleotides added to a multiplexed nucleic acid targeted assays cannot create primer-dimer artifacts.

It is also notable that total fluorescence intensity was higher by 1.6-fold when the MERS-CoV amplicon was used as a target rather than a synthetic RNA simulant. This showed that in addition to being complementary to the beacon loop, the amplicon from the MERS-CoV genome had an additional nucleotide complementary to the first (standard) nucleotide in the stem (Figs. 2 D and 3 E) . This improved the efficiency of target hybridization, NESA-induced cleavage, and downstream dissociation of the cleaved fragments.

Thermal profiles were recorded after separately incubating these with both standard and AEGIS MBs and camera images are also taken at room temperature for visualization. For standard MB, incubation with 2fold excess of the 6mer failed to open the beacon, while 8mer DNA target exhibited slight increase in fluorescence. This was consistent with the design strategy that intramolecular binding constant between the stem sequences is far greater than the intermolecular interaction between one arm of the stem and short DNA targets (6mer or 8mer). On the other hand, in the presence of the 10mer and 12mer targets, stem and part of the loop of the MB hybridized to the target, disrupted the hairpin structure, and increased the background fluorescence by 24% and 62%, respectively (Fig. 4A) . In contrast, AEGIS-containing MB was not opened by any of the stem targets tested except with the 12mer target where only slight increase in fluorescence is observed (Fig. 4B) . These results suggest that AEGIS-modified molecular beacons are superior to standard beacons in terms of resistance to stem invasion and overall NESA efficiency.",
