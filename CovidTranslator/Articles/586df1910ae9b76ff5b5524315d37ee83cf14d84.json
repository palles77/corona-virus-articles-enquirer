This novel coronavirus is culturable and two complete genome sequences are now available. Furthermore, molecular detection and indirect immunofluorescence assay have been developed.

In humans, diseases caused by coronaviruses range from the common cold to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Based on genome sequence analyses, coronaviruses are phylogenetically divided into three genera known as Alph-, Beta-and Gammacoronavirus. Betacoronavirus contains four subgroups, named 2a, 2b, 2c and 2d. A fourth genera, provisionally named Deltacoronavirus, comprises a number of recently identified coronaviruses mainly from birds. Alph-and Betacoronavirus hosts are predominantly domestic mammalian animals and humans, including swine (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV; porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, PEDV), bovine (bovine coronavirus, BCoV), mice (mouse hepatitis virus, MHV), dog (canine coronavirus, CCoV), cat (feline infectious peritonitis virus, FIPV) and bat (bat coronavirus HKU4, BatCoV-HKU4). Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) known so far include HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63 and SARS (SARS-CoV). Gammacoronavirus comprises primarily avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and beluga whale coronavirus SW1 (BWCoV-SW1) [1].

The patient who was previously well, was severely ill and presented with acute pneumonia and later renal failure with a fatal outcome 11 days after hospitalization [10] . Clinical specimens were collected and the patient's sputum was used to inoculate Vero and LLC-MK2 cells for viral culture. Cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed and, upon passaging of the culture supernatant to fresh cells, the same CPE was observed, suggesting viral replication. All known respiratory tract pathogens including the influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza viruses types 1\uf02d3, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, rhinovirus, and human herpesvirus types 1\uf02d3 were tested and all yielded negative results from the sputum and cell culture supernatant. However, the pancoronavirus real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay used to detect coronaviruses revealed the expected size of the PCR fragments, and found that they corresponded to a conserved region of ORF1b of the replicase gene of a coronavirus. Phylogenetic analysis of this fragment with other known coronaviruses genes showed that this novel virus together with the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 belonged to subgroup 2c of the linage Betacoronavirus, indicating the emergence of a novel coronavirus [11] . The complete genome of the virus was subsequently sequenced at the Erasmus Medical Cerner (EMC) in Rotterdam in the Netherlands and was named human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), later named MERS-CoV (GenBank accession number: JX869059).",

The pancoronavirus RT-PCR assay, however, yielded a correct band size (208 bp) that corresponded to the conserved RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene of coronavirus in lower respiratory tract specimens. Assays for detection of known human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63, -HKU1 and SARS-CoV were negative [12] . A comparison of the PCR fragment sequence with the nucleotide sequence of HCoV-EMC isolated from case 1, showed that they shared 99% identity, indicating the same viral infection.

            "text": "Coronaviruses are the largest known enveloped positivestranded RNA viruses, ranging in length from 26 to 32 kb. A terminal cap at the 5\u2032 end is followed by a leader sequence of 65-98 nucleotides (nt), and an untranslated region (UTR) of 200-600 nt. The leader sequence is present at the 5\u2032 end of all subgenomic mRNAs. Another UTR of 200-500 nt is at the 3\u2032 end of the genome followed by a poly(A) tail of variable length. 5\u2032-UTR contains the signals for genome replication, transcription and encapsidation, whereas the 3\u2032-UTR contains transcription termination signals [14] . At the 5\u2032 end nearly two-thirds of the genome encode two large overlapping open reading frames (ORF), ORF1a and ORF1b. When the coronavirus enters the host cell, ORF1a and ORF1b are first translated into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. Production of pp1ab requires a programmed \uf02d1 ribosomal frameshift between the ORF1a and ORF1b junction. These polyproteins are processed autoproteolytically and subsequently form a transcriptionreplication complex [15] . About one-third of the genome at the 3\u2032 end encodes four structural proteins, named the spike protein (S), envelop protein (E), small membrane protein (M) and the nucleocapsid protein (N). These structural proteins are present in all known coronaviruses. The general genome organisation of coronaviruses is as follows: 5\u2032-UTR-1a/1b-spike (S)-envelope (E)-membrane (M)-nucleocapsid (N)-3\u2032-UTR. Among the structural proteins are several small group-specific ORFs, which differ markedly in number and gene order, but are conserved within the same group. These small ORFs are dispensable for viral replication in vitro, but determine viral pathogenesis [16] .",

Near the 5\u2032 end, about 3/4 of the genome is occupied by two large ORFs, ORF1a (279\uf02d13433 nt) and ORF1b (13433\uf02d21514 nt). These two ORFs are translated from genomic mRNA to produce polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab by ribosomal frameshifting at the junction of ORF1a and ORF1b, with nt 13427 to 13433 predicted to form the \"slippery sequence\" (5\u2032-UUUAAAC-3\u2032) to produce polyproteins pp1ab. Downstream of ORF1b, the genome encodes four structure proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [17] . Four small non-structural ORFs (3a, 3b, 3c, 3d) lie between the S and E genes.

Subsequently, a confirmatory assay targeting the ORF1b gene was developed, which does not overlap with the pan-coronavirus RT-PCR assays [18] . A third, confirmatory real-time RT-PCR assay, developed in Europe laboratories, targeted the ORF1a (1a assay) and its sensitivity was slightly lower than that of the upE assay. Furthermore, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) to detect the antibody response was developed using convalescent patient serum that was biologically safe [19] . The upE assay used in combination with the 1a assay has been reported to provide a rigorously validated and highly sensitive result [20] . We have designed several primers and probes for real-time RT-PCR, modified using locked nucleic acid (LNA), to target the ORF1b gene with validated high sensitivity and no cross-reaction with HCoV-229E, -OC43, -NL63, -HKU1 and other respiratory pathogens [21] .

The clinical presentation of acute pneumonia and renal failure observed in the fatal cases resembled SARS-CoV that outbroke in 2002\uf02d2003. MERS-CoV does not use the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a receptor for cell entry but maintains broad replicative capability in mammalian cell lines from bats, pigs and humans, indicating that MERS-CoV is different from SARS-CoV [22] . Phylogenetically, however, HCoV-EMC is most closely related to the bat coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 in the same Betacoronavirus genus as SARS-CoV, indicating a zoonotic origin ",
