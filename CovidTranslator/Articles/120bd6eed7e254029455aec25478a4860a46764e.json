It is not a separate discipline from general pathology, but a different approach to the study of disease, in which the principles of general pathology are applied at the level of the tissue or organ or even the entire body. As for general pathology, the learning process is simplified by categorization, so Section II of this book is arranged in chapters based on a particular organ system. Again, this subdivision is arbitrary, and the student must bear in mind that disease seldom, if ever, affects only one organ or tissue. It also helps to remember that most organs or tissues respond in a similar way to a particular type of injury, hence the value in mastering the concepts of general pathology before the organ system approach. There is no optimum arrangement of the organ system chapters, so pathology of organ systems can be taught in different sequences in different curricula.",

In North America, pathologists are certified as anatomic pathologists, interested especially in the morphologic changes of gross (macroscopic) pathology and histopathology (microscopic pathology of tissues), or as clinical pathologists, who work more with microscopic and biochemical evaluations of blood, urine, and other bodily fluids or with cytologic samples, in which individual cells are studied rather than the intact tissue.

This pathology textbook begins with a 6-chapter general pathology section followed by 15 chapters of pathology of organ systems (systemic pathology). Although this layout parallels the instruction of pathology in many veterinary schools, the division into general pathology and systemic pathology is somewhat artificial. General pathology is the study of the reaction of cells or tissues to injury with a focus on the mechanisms of that response. In the first six chapters of this book, the response to injury is classified as cellular adaptations (degenerative, regenerative, or restorative), vascular disorders, inflammation, or neoplasia, with an additional chapter on the mechanisms of infectious diseases and one on disorders of immunity. These categorizations simplify the teaching and learning of general pathology. However, in the living body, cell injury provokes a variety of vascular, inflammatory, and immune-mediated responses in addition to disturbances of growth. These reactions not only extend beyond the injured cell to the organ or organismal level but also can occur simultaneously or in rapid succession. This first chapter is focused on the cellular responses to injury, not only on the degeneration that can progress to cell death but also on the adaptations of surviving cells.

The term fluidic indicates that proteins and lipids in the membrane are not immovable but can travel as part of the cytocavitary system ( Fig. 1-3 ) throughout the physical extent of the cell. As an example of this process of \"fluidic\" movement, transmembrane proteins used as cell surface receptors are synthesized and assembled in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER), inserted into membranes in the Golgi complex, and moved (fluidic) to the cell's surface at the plasma membrane via the cytocavitary system (see Fig. 1-3) .",

As an extension of a transmembrane protein, cell surface receptors receive and interpret extracellular signals (i.e., ligands) from the environment.

There are hundreds of different types of glycoprotein and lipoprotein transmembrane receptors; each type is linked to a specific intracellular biochemical pathway, and individual cells contain many of these receptors based on their function as determined by their genome. Transmembrane receptors are often used by infectious microbes to invade cells or use cell systems during their life cycles, thus initiating a process that can injure the host cell. These receptors and their roles in the mechanisms of infectious disease are discussed in detail in Chapter 4.",

After certification, many anatomic pathologists specialize further in practice. Diagnostic pathologists are involved in autopsy (syn: necropsy; postmortem gross and histologic examination along with correlation of ancillary test results) and histologic examination of surgical biopsy specimens.

For example, the word malacia, which literally means softening, implies a lack of mineralization when applied to bones, but when applied to the brain, it means necrosis. That brings us to an important word that pathologists use a lot and that figures prominently in this chapter-necrosis. It means death or, more precisely, the structural changes that follow death, not of the entire organism, but of cells within an organ or tissue. Do not worry, there will be more on necrosis in subsequent sections! microscopy in addition to their own eyes, that the word autopsy could just as well be applied to other diagnostic imaging modalities (e.g., radiography or computed tomography). However, by convention, the term has been relegated to the discipline of pathology, and the autopsy or biopsy examination generally implies a search for lesions. second messenger systems are activated, leading to the inhibition of division and development of affected \"bystander\" cells. This outcome allows specific types of cells to increase in number during development, while inhibiting other less essential cell types. Notch-signaling pathways are involved in the development of neural tissues, blood vessels, heart, pancreas, mammary gland, T lymphocytes, hematopoietic lineages, and other cell types. Notch-signaling pathways also play a role in mature animals. They appear to determine, for example, whether enteric stem cells differentiate into villous enterocytes with secretory or absorptive functions. Diseases that kill or injure enteric crypt stem cells (e.g., parvovirus) or villous enterocytes (e.g., coronaviruses) probably disrupt notch-signaling pathways, leading to a lack of secretory or absorptive enterocytes during healing with failure to return to \"normal\" function (see Chapter 7). ribosomes synthesize proteins that are released into the cytosol and used within the cell. Fixed ribosomes synthesize proteins that are (1) inserted into the cell membrane (transmembrane proteins) at the rER and subsequently moved (fluid mosaic membrane model) to their final destinations usually within the plasma membrane or (2) placed in membrane-bound vesicles and moved through the Golgi complex (see next paragraph) to the plasma membrane and released via exocytosis into the extracellular environment.",

Cold causes vasoconstriction, limiting the blood supply to cells and tissues; extreme cold literally freezes cells with formation of ice crystals within the cytosol that disrupt cell membranes. Ionizing and ultraviolet radiation are the most important types of radiation causing cellular injury. Ionizing radiation, with its frequencies above the ultraviolet range, ionizes atoms or molecules, which then cause direct cell membrane or organelle damage or the production of free radicals that react with other cellular components, especially DNA. Ionizing radiation injury is a localized side effect of radiation therapy for cancer. Ultraviolet (frequencies just above that of visible light) radiation injury develops from exposure of sparsely haired and lightly pigmented skin (or other minimally pigmented tissues, such as the conjunctiva) to sunlight. Ultraviolet radiation can disrupt cellular bonds with the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It also damages DNA, mainly through the formation of pyrimidine dimers. Electrical currents generate heat as they pass through tissues (e.g., skin, with high resistance), which can result in burns.

DNA damage Although certain injurious agents can cause ATP depletion, membrane damage, pathway disruption, or DNA damage in isolation, more often there is interplay among these basic mechanisms. Anything that decreases the supply of oxygen and other nutrients to the cell or that damages mitochondria directly halts oxidative phosphorylation, leading to rapid depletion of ATP, even in those cells that can switch to anaerobic glycolysis. The ATP depletion results in additional cell damage by causing failure of energydependent enzymes, in particular the cell membrane adenosinetriphosphatase ion pumps that control cell volume and electrolyte balance. Mitochondria are the major site of ATP generation and are also one of the most vulnerable organelles of the cell. Importantly, mitochondrial injury results not only in ATP depletion but also in increased permeability of mitochondrial membranes with resultant loss of calcium homeostasis and activation of enzymes, such as phospholipases, proteases, and endonucleases, hence inflicting damage on mitochondrial and other cell membranes, structural and enzymatic proteins, and nucleic acids. mitochondria, which are perhaps the organelles most susceptible to injury, are also thought to direct many of the processes of cellular adaptation, degeneration, and death through apoptosis or programmed necrosis ( Fig. 1-8) .",

Not surprisingly, many cancer cells have active telomerase to maintain the length of their telomeres. In cells with little regenerative capacity, such as neurons, accumulation of lipofuscin and other metabolic products contributes to their degeneration and loss, leading to cerebrocortical atrophy in the aging brain. However, many of the common \"aging lesions\" in geriatric animals (e.g., nodular hyperplasia in the liver [see Fig. 8 ",

Acute cell swelling is the classic morphologic change in reversible injury; however, it is also the typical early change of irreversible cell injury. Irrespective of the nature of the initial injury, hypoxia is often the ultimate cause of acute cell swelling because it results in adenosine triphosphate depletion. The hypoxic cell then swells because of loss of volume control when membrane adenosine triphosphatase ionic pumps fail. Acute cell swelling is also a response to direct cell membrane damage from lipid peroxidation (by reactive oxygen species), binding of certain toxins, damage to ion channels, or insertion of transmembrane pore-forming complexes. Because acute cell swelling is a common early response to both reversible and irreversible injury, it is well to think of this morphologic change as a marker of potentially reversible cell injury. Cells, depending on their reparative or regenerative capacities, may recover from potentially irreversible cell injury; however, if the injury is severe or sustained, acute cell swelling becomes the initial step in the process of cell death. If the injury is not so severe as to be lethal, then the cell may not succumb but (again depending on the nature of the injury and of the cell) is unlikely to recover completely or to return to its \"normal\" structural and functional state. chemical modifications (see the following section).

The MAC, bacterial cytolysins, and NK cells exert their effect in part by forming a pore or channel that disrupts the lipid bilayers of the plasma membrane. The MAC is assembled from terminal components of the complement pathway, which are abundant in blood. Assembly of the MAC begins with enzymatic cleavage of complement fragment 5b (C5b) from complement component 5 (C5). Complement component 6 (C6) binds a labile site on C5b to produce a stable intermediate. Subsequent binding of complement component 7 (C7) renders the MAC precursor lipophilic. With binding of the \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 subunits of complement component 8 (C8), the MAC precursor penetrates a nearby cell membrane lipid bilayer. Binding and oligomerization of complement component 9 (C9) then completes formation of the MAC, which creates a lytic pore that is part of the innate immune response to bacteria. Cluster of differentiation 59 (CD59), a glycoprotein receptor on the surface of leukocytes, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (and overexpressed on some cancer cells), blocks penetration of cell membranes by the C5b-8 precursor and blocks incorporation of C9 into the MAC, thereby protecting host cells against cell membrane injury.",

Because any injury to the respiratory or cardiovascular system can lead to hypoxia, it is commonly the ultimate cause of acute cell swelling. When cellular oxygen is depleted, oxidative phosphorylation stops, and the cell must switch to anaerobic metabolism (i.e., glycolysis) or die. As production of ATP declines, the resultant drop stimulates hexokinases, phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1), and other enzymes of glycolysis. PFK1 catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, another integral step in glycolysis. The end products of glycolysis are ATP and pyruvate and heat. This anaerobic generation of ATP (though less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation) contributes to short-term survival of the cell. In addition, pyruvate produced by glycolysis can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. However, certain specialized cells (e.g., neurons) cannot generate ATP anaerobically and therefore need a continuous supply of oxygen and glucose.

Cell swelling, resulting from loss of volume control (see later), is the fundamental mechanism of oncotic necrosis and distinguishes it from apoptosis. Just as in reversible acute cell swelling, the initial O 2 deficit in irreversible acute cell swelling causes an uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and a switch to anaerobic glycolysis with accumulation of lactic acid and a resulting decrease in pH of the cytosol. The Na + /H + exchanger exports the excess H + in exchange for Na + . However, because glycolysis is less efficient in ATP production than oxidative phosphorylation, the decreased ATP concentration leads to failure of ionic ATPase pumps and a loss of volume control (i.e., failure of Na + /K + -ATPase pumps with influx of Na + , Ca 2+ , and water). In addition, the normal function of enzymes, contractile proteins, membrane pumps, and other protein-based mechanisms in the cell occurs in a very narrow pH range around 7.0. With glycolysis the cytosol becomes acidic, thus limiting or blocking these mechanisms and exacerbating cellular dysfunction.",

However, cell death is also a point-of-no-return response to severe injury, and it is this pathologic form of cell death that is the topic of this section. Cell death typically assumes one of two morphologic forms ( Fig. 1-13 ): necrosis or apoptosis. The term necrosis has evolved to mean death by swelling of the cell (oncosis) with eventual rupture of cell membranes. Necrotic cell death typically involves groups or zones of cells and elicits an inflammatory reaction because of the release of cell contents into the ECM. Apoptosis, in contrast, is directed by cellular signaling cascades and typically affects individual cells. Apoptosis is a process of condensation and shrinkage of the cell and its organelles with eventual fragmentation of the cell. Importantly, apoptotic cell fragments remain membrane bound; thus no cellular components that could induce inflammation are released. Autophagy is a third possible mechanism of cell death, but it is more commonly a means of cell survival. (See subsequent section on Autophagy under Chronic Cell Injury and Cell Adaptation.) Whereas apoptosis has long been recognized as a regulated or programmed process, not only responsible for physiologic removal of surplus cells but also occurring as a reaction to certain injuries, necrosis was once considered an entirely accidental and random response to injury. However, with the discovery that inhibition of apoptosis could shift cells from apoptotic death to a regulated process of oncotic death, the idea arose that necrosis could, at least in certain situations, be regulated by cellular signaling pathways. Severe or persistent injury can overwhelm the cell's capacity to restore homeostasis, in which case potentially reversible acute cell swelling can become irreversible and progress to cell death.",

If an acutely swollen cell fails to correct the electrolyte imbalance and loss of volume control, then potentially reversible cell injury can become the initial stage of oncotic necrosis. Once thought always to be unregulated, oncotic necrosis, like apoptosis, can be a programmed process (necroptosis). Programmed cell death, whether by necroptosis or apoptosis, has many extrinsic and intrinsic (acting mainly through mitochondria) triggers. Programmed cell death is a complex and varied process that includes stages of initiation, propagation, and execution. Cells that die by oncotic necrosis tend to do so in groups, whereas apoptosis commonly affects individual cells. Furthermore, oncotic necrosis results in rupture of cell membranes and release of cytoplasmic content into the extracellular matrix with ensuing inflammation.

In fact, regulated necrosis may be the predominant form of oncotic cell death. A regulated process of necrotic cell death begins with a trigger (e.g., binding of TNF or Fas ligand [FasL] to a death receptor [DR; i.e., transmembrane protein of the plasma membrane]), followed sequentially by initiation, propagation, and execution. A cell can respond to binding of TNF to its receptor in at least three different ways: (1) survival through activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB), (2) apoptosis, or (3) necrosis. Apoptosis is directed by caspases. Interestingly, it was the discovery that inhibition of caspases, rather than protecting the cell from death, could redirect it from apoptosis to necrotic cell death. The myriad triggers of regulated necrosis include TNF, FasL, DNA damage, cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) via the T lymphocyte receptor, lipopolysaccharide via Toll-like receptors, and interferon \u03b3. The term necroptosis refers to the regulated necrotic cell death that begins with TNF receptor activation by TNF and is initiated by receptor-interacting proteinserine/threonine kinase (RIPK) 1. The ubiquitination status of RIPK1 determines whether it directs the cell toward survival, apoptosis, or necroptosis. Inhibition of caspase-8, in particular, is important in redirecting the cell from apoptosis toward necroptosis with assembly of the so-called necrosome, composed of RIPK1, RIPK3, and mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Though much remains to be learned about the necroptosis pathway, MLKL has been proposed as the main mediator downstream of RIPK3.",

The term coagulative necrosis refers to the denaturation of cytoplasmic proteins, which at the histologic level imparts an opaque and intense cytoplasmic eosinophilia to necrotic cells. Coagulative necrosis is a typical early response to hypoxia, ischemia, or toxic injury. It appears that the initial injury or the subsequent cellular acidosis denatures not only structural proteins, but also lysosomal enzymes in the affected cell. Normally, lysosomal enzymes would cause proteolytic disintegration of the entire cell, but as a result of this denaturation, proteolytic disintegration of the cell is delayed. However, the degradation of nucleic acids is not hindered. Thus a cell that has undergone coagulative necrosis has the expected nuclear features of cell death by oncosis (i.e., pyknosis, karyorrhexis, or karyolysis), but the cell outlines are still visible histologically (see Fig. 1-16 ). Coagulative necrosis is most easily recognized in the liver, kidney, myocardium, or skeletal zonal necrosis is more easily recognized macroscopically precisely because it differs from adjacent viable tissue. Multifocal hepatic necrosis, for example, is recognizable in part because the necrotic foci differ from surrounding viable tissue and every hepatic lobule is not affected in the same manner. Likewise, segmental laminar cerebrocortical necrosis is recognized because only segments of the cerebral cortex are discolored or changed in texture or structure. An infarct, which is necrosis due to regional loss of blood supply, is recognized because it assumes the shape of the vascular fieldrhomboidal in many tissues (e.g., lung or skin) or conical (wedge shaped in two dimensions) with its base at the edge of the spleen (see Fig. 13 -64) or cortical surface of the kidney (see Figs. 2-37 and 2-38).",

Gangrene denotes a type of necrosis that tends to develop at the distal aspect of extremities, such as the limbs, tail, or pinnae, or in dependent portions of organs, such as the mammary glands or lung lobes. Gangrene can be designated as wet or dry; these forms are unrelated. If the dependent necrotic tissue is infected by certain bacteria, wet gangrene ensues. If those bacteria are gas forming (e.g., Clostridium spp.), then wet gangrene becomes gas gangrene. In the lung, wet gangrene is often a sequel to the lytic necrosis of aspiration pneumonia. The aspirated material could be foreign material (food or medicament) or gastric content (a mixture of ingesta and gastric secretions). Such materials can be caustic in their own right and are also likely to deliver bacteria from the environment or oropharynx into the lung. Staphylococcal infection of the ruminant mammary gland can result in gangrenous mastitis ( Fig.  1-20, A; E-Fig. 1-3) , a form of wet gangrene. Grossly, tissues with wet gangrene are red-black and wet. Histologically, the lesion of wet gangrene resembles that of liquefactive necrosis but is usually accompanied by more numerous leukocytes, especially neutrophils.",

            "text": "Sequelae to Oncotic Necrosis. Oncotic necrosis elicits an inflammatory reaction in most tissues. In the CNS the inflammatory reaction is slow to develop and consists mainly of an influx of macrophages that become gitter cells. In most other tissues a band of hyperemia (hemorrhage and acute inflammation) encircles the necrotic tissue and brings leukocytes to the site. The neutrophils and macrophages phagocytize and lyse the necrotic tissue, converting coagulative to liquefactive necrosis and hastening (in many cases) the removal of damaged tissue. In other cases, foreign material or bone fragments resist digestion and form a sequestrum. Smaller cavitations left by liquefactive necrosis may heal without scarring, depending on the regenerative capacity of the affected tissue. The liver is an organ with high regenerative capacity and, because of its dual blood supply, is not prone to infarction. In contrast, in renal A B or injury from toxins or ROS, nutrient deprivation or withdrawal of growth factors or hormones, DNA damage, or immune-mediated injury from cytotoxic T lymphocytes or NK cells. Apoptosis ( Fig.  1-22 ) proceeds through an extrinsic pathway (initiated by the binding of a ligand to its DR) or an intrinsic pathway (initiated in mitochondria in response to various stresses or DNA damage) and almost always entails activation of caspases. Caspases are cysteine proteases that cleave peptides after aspartate residues. The initiator caspases that start the process of apoptosis include caspase-8 (activated by the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) of the extrinsic pathway), caspase-9 (activated with the apoptosome in the intrinsic pathway), and caspase-2 (activated by p53 following DNA damage). The initiator caspases activate effector caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7, which then execute apoptosis. The Extrinsic (Death Receptor-Initiated) Pathway. Extrinsic apoptosis (see Fig. 1 -22) begins with ligand-induced trimerization of a cell surface DR. The DRs include Fas, tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) 1, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAILR). The next step is internalization and recruitment of the intermediate membrane proteins TNF receptorassociated death domain (TRADD), Fas-associated death domain (FADD), and caspase-8 to form the cytoplasmic DISC. Remember that RIPK1, depending on its ubiquitination status, can associate with the trimerized DR and direct the cell toward regulated necrosis (if caspases are inhibited) or toward survival via activation of NF\u03baB, and has an N-terminal death domain (DD) that links it to the apoptotic pathway through adaptor proteins such as TRADD or FADD. TRADD interacts with FADD, which in turn activates procaspase-8. Sufficient active caspase-8 then activates effector (executioner) caspase-3 and caspase-7 to execute apoptosis. Caspase-8 can also truncate Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, which translocates to mitochondria to trigger intrinsic apoptosis (see the next section). Importantly, the protein FLIP blocks the extrinsic pathway by binding procaspase-8 without activating it. If caspase-8 activity is insufficient, DR-mediated apoptosis can be augmented by mitochondria, almost always through Bcl-2 proteins, such as the proapoptotic Bak (Bcl-2 antagonist/killer) and Bax (Bcl-2-associated X protein). Even cells that cannot initiate or propagate apoptotic signaling can still die, but do so via caspase-independent pathways of cell death, such as regulated necrosis.",

The key event of intrinsic apoptosis is mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP). MOMP can be triggered by activation, posttranslational modification, and upregulation of proapoptotic BH3-only proteins (e.g., PUMA protein). The BH3-only proteins usually induce MOMP via oligomerization of Bax and Bak to form channels in the outer mitochondrial membrane. This permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane releases cytochrome c from the intermembrane space into the cytosol. Cytochrome c promotes the assembly of the caspase-activating complex or apoptosome, which consists of caspase-9 plus apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1).

Antemortem cell death is recognized by the morphologic changes that follow the biochemical events of cell death and takes time (minutes to hours) to develop. Autolysis, in contrast, is the decomposition of cells that takes place after somatic death (i.e., death of the body) or after collection of a biopsy sample from a living animal. Autolysis results in morphologic changes in cells and tissues, and it is these changes that the pathologist must distinguish from those of necrosis. Ideally, autolysis is minimized by collecting tissues before (biopsy) or as close to the time of somatic death as possible and fixing them for histologic processing upon collection. This is especially important in tissues such as the intestine, in which autolysis develops within minutes because the mucosal epithelium is exposed to bacteria and digestive enzymes from the gut lumen. Autolyzed enterocytes have microscopic changes that can be mistaken for degenerative lesions, such as loss of the microvillous brush border, rounding, attenuation, and detachment from the basement membrane.

Dark neurons must be distinguished from neurons that died from ischemia or excitotoxicity (see Chapter 14).

Hypertrophy often accompanies an increase in cell number (hyperplasia) due to cellular proliferation but as a standalone phenomenon is observed mainly in organs or tissues such as the heart (E- Fig. 1-13 ; see Chapter 10) or skeletal muscle (see Chapter 15), in which the principal cells are postmitotic and incapable of replication. When the term hypertrophy is applied at the In the case of repetitive or continuous injury that is not inherently or immediately lethal, cells of many different types can survive, even without complete recovery, by adapting. Depending on the cell type-not all cells are capable of all possible responsescellular adaptations to chronic injury include the following: 1. Hypertrophy, an increase in cell size by virtue of an increase in number and size of organelles 2. Hyperplasia, an increase in cell number that only those cells capable of mitosis can undergo 3. Metaplasia, a change from one differentiated cell type to another of the same germ layer (e.g., from ciliated epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium in the respiratory tract) 4.

Dysplasia is an adaptation without apparent advantages to the host. Indeed, dysplasia can be a precursor to malignant neoplasia (cancer). A B cellular level, it denotes an increase in cell size because of an increase in size or number of organelles as distinguished from increased cell size from hydropic cell swelling (loss of volume control) or from accumulation of endogenous or exogenous substances. Cellular hypertrophy is the process by which postmitotic cells, such as cardiomyocytes or skeletal myocytes, can grow as the juvenile animal grows. It is also the physiologic response of striated muscle to increased workload such as occurs in training of race horses. Smooth muscle cells (e.g., in the tunica media of arteries) also undergo hypertrophy in response to increased workload. Although muscular hypertrophy increases functional capacity in the short term, accompanying changes, such as increased fibrous stroma or decreased vascular perfusion, in myocardium, for example, can lead to decompensation of the affected organ.",

This response can occur only in a cell population that is capable of mitosis (see subsequent section on the Cell Cycle). Many epithelial cells (e.g., hepatocytes and epithelia of the epidermis and intestinal mucosae) are quick to undergo hyperplasia in response to hormonal stimulation, inflammation, or physical trauma. Hyperplasia of glandular epithelium (e.g., thyroid follicular epithelium) can be marked, resulting in striking gross enlargement of the thyroid gland ( Fig. 1-27) . Importantly, hyperplasia differs from neoplastic cellular proliferation in that it generally subsides if the stimulus is removed. Striated muscle and nervous system tissues have negligible capacity to proliferate and in general do not undergo hyperplasia. Other tissues, such as smooth muscle, bone, and cartilage, are intermediate in their ability to proliferate. Hyperplasia is considered physiologic when it is a response to cyclic hormonal stimulation as in the endometrial or mammary development of pregnancy and lactation, respectively. The hyperplasia of wound healing is not a normal event, but it is an appropriate and compensatory response of fibroblasts and endothelial cells to traumatic injury. Likewise, hyperplastic goiter is not a normal change in the thyroid gland (see Fig. 1 -27; see also Chapter 12) but is an appropriate response to generate thyroid hormones in the face of iodine deficiency. Idiopathic (of unknown cause) nodular hyperplasia is encountered rather commonly in certain organs (e.g., liver, pancreas, or spleen), especially in older dogs, and often is of no clinical significance. In contrast, inappropriate elevation of trophic hormones or growth factors can lead to persistent hyperplasia that can be a precursor to neoplastic transformation (see Chapter 6).",

Some types of viruses produce characteristic intranuclear or cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Certain DNA viruses (e.g., herpesviruses, adenoviruses, and parvoviruses) exclusively produce intranuclear inclusions that are round to oval and vary from eosinophilic to basophilic or amphophilic. Other DNA viruses (e.g., poxviruses) produce large eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies of RNA viruses (e.g., rabies virus and canine distemper virus) are eosinophilic and cytoplasmic. The viral inclusions of rabies, called Negri bodies, are in the cytoplasm of neuronal soma. Canine distemper virus produces both cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions (see Fig. 1-32, C) . The intranuclear location of inclusions in this RNA viral infection has been attributed to heat shock proteins. Lead Inclusions. In some cases of lead poisoning, intranuclear inclusions develop in renal tubular epithelial cells. The inclusions are a mixture of lead and protein and are more easily Amyloid. Increasingly diseases are recognized to be the result of misfolding of soluble and functional peptides or proteins, converting them into relatively insoluble and nonfunctional aggregates. Amyloidosis is one of the best-studied protein-misfolding disorders. Aggregated proteins can be rather amorphous ultrastructurally; however, in the case of amyloidosis, the misfolded and aggregated proteins have a characteristic highly organized fibrillar structure, even though their amino acid sequence varies. Thus amyloidosis is a biochemically diverse group of disorders that have a common pathogenesis (protein misfolding) and generic morphologic appearance.

Amyloid is typically formed from unfolded or partially unfolded proteins or peptide fragments and has a highly ordered, generic (independent of amino acid sequence) structure of fibrillar polypeptide chains that are rich in cross \u03b2-sheets (arranged perpendicular to the axis of the fibrils) and can self-replicate by virtue of this template formation. Amyloidosis was recognized as a disease by Virchow, who dubbed the offending material amyloid (starchlike) because the tissue deposits were stained with iodine. Iodine is still used on occasion as a gross technique to stain amyloid (see Fig. 11 -40), even though amyloid deposits consist mainly of protein (typically associated with other molecules, such as carbohydrate moieties). If visible macroscopically, amyloid appears as yellow, waxy, coalescing nodular or amorphous deposits ( Fig. 1-34 ). At the light microscopic level, amyloid is homogeneous to indistinctly fibrillar, and pale eosinophilic ( Fig. 1-35, A) . With the Congo red stain, amyloid takes a more orange-red hue (i.e., congophilia) (see Fig. 1-35, B) . Because of its molecular periodicity, amyloid is anisotropic. Anisotropic substances are birefringent (i.e., they can refract polarized light into two rays that vibrate in perpendicular waves). Thus, when histologic sections are viewed through the microscope with polarized light (achieved by inserting a polarizing filter between the light source and the histologic section), amyloid deposits or other anisotropic substances (e.g., crystals, collagen) can rotate the plane of light so that it passes through the analyzer (a second polarizing filter between the histologic section and the oculars), whereas negligible light is passed through isotropic substances (most of the rest of the section). Amyloid has characteristic apple-green birefringence in polarized light, especially with the Congo red stain (see Fig. 1-35, C) .

A variety of extracellular proteinaceous accumulations have a hyaline appearance in histologic sections. Examples include protein casts (albumin, hemoglobin, or myoglobin) in the lumen of renal tubules; serum or plasma in blood vessels; plasma proteins in vessel walls; collagen fibers in some scars or collagen fibers encrusted with proteins from degranulated eosinophils; thickened basement membranes; the \"hyaline membranes\" of diffuse alveolar damage in acute respiratory distress syndrome (see Chapter 9); fibrin thrombi in the microvasculature in disseminated intravascular coagulation (see Chapter 2); and amyloid (described next). In contrast to systemic amyloidosis, the severity of disease in localized amyloidosis may depend more on the biochemical nature of the amyloid fibrils. In fact, the precursor peptides or intermediate oligomers, rather than the mature amyloid fibrils, are thought to be the injurious agent at least in some forms of localized amyloidosis. The amyloid deposited in pancreatic islets of cats and human beings is derived from islet amyloid peptide and is secreted by the \u03b2 cells. It can be associated with insulin-resistant (type 2) diabetes mellitus, but islet amyloidosis is also encountered in cats with normal glucose tolerance (see Chapter 12).

AL amyloid retains its congophilia and apple-green birefringence after pretreatment with potassium permanganate.

In Shar-Pei dogs and Abyssinian cats, AA amyloid deposits are typically most abundant in the renal medullary interstitium, rather than in renal glomeruli. Amyloid A is sensitive to potassium permanganate (i.e., congophilia and apple-green birefringence are lost or diminished after potassium permanganate pretreatment).",

Necrosis, especially necrosis that destroys epithelial basement membranes, but also necrosis of mesenchymal tissues, tends to induce proliferation of fibroblasts. In many injured tissues, especially beneath ulcers or in wound healing, fibroblastic proliferation is accompanied by endothelial proliferation with formation of granulation tissue (fibrosis plus neovascularization [see Chapters 3 and 17]). As granulation tissue matures, the neovascularization subsides, fibroblasts become quiescent, collagen fibers remain, and scar tissue is the end result. In the liver (see Chapter 8), stellate cells are the source of the collagen in fibrosis. Macrophages (i.e., Kupffer cells in the liver, histiocytes, or other tissue macrophages) direct fibrosis by release of cytokines and growth factors such as TNF-\u03b1 and TGF-\u03b2. Fatty Infiltration. Fatty infiltration is an increase in the number and/or volume of adipocytes in the interstitium of an organ or tissue. Thus it is distinct from the intracellular accumulations known as lipidosis or steatosis. Normally adipocytes are present in small numbers in the myocardial interstitium, especially near the epicardium, and in skeletal muscle bundles. The adipocytes can increase in size and number in obesity and in certain cardiomyopathies (see Chapter 10) or skeletal myopathies (see Chapter 15 and Fig. 15-9) .

Certain nonparathyroid neoplasms are associated with the so-called humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy irreversible injury. Ischemia opens membrane calcium channels, leading to increased intracellular calcium concentration, which is normally sequestered in the cytosol, ER, and mitochondria, each with its own Ca 2+ -ATPase membrane pumps. The increased intracellular calcium concentration activates calpains, which cleave Na + / Ca 2+ exchangers in mitochondrial and other cell membranes, leading to decreased efflux of Ca 2+ and decreased reuptake of Ca 2+ by the ER. Thus calcium overload is an expected sequel to cell death. Dystrophic calcification is most prominent in mitochondria and is first evident histologically as a basophilic stippling of the dead cell. With increasing deposition of calcium salts, the entire cell and even extracellular tissue can be calcified, resulting in more intense and widespread basophilia.

Many cases, especially with the lower exposure in urban-dwelling people or animals that breathe polluted air, are not associated with clinical disease but impart a fine gray-black stippling to the lung ( Fig. 1-41, A) , visible through the visceral pleura, plus a dark gray discoloration of tracheobronchial lymph nodes.

The genome of a mitochondrial chromosome encodes for 37 genes, including those for mRNAs, rRNAs, transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and 13 protein subunits for enzymes, such as cytochrome b and cytochrome oxidase, which are involved in oxidative phosphorylation. The mitochondrial genome also has distinct transcription and protein-synthesis (i.e., translation) systems.

Additionally, genes, especially those of the major histocompatibility complex (see Chapter 5), play important roles in establishing the resistance (or susceptibility) of an animal to infectious diseases. Many biologic traits have a mendelian pattern of inheritance. Gene expression, however, depends on cell structure and function and the responses of cells to injury. Constitutively expressed genes, including those for tRNAs, rRNAs, cell membranes, and enzymes, are transcribed continually. In contrast, facultative or differentially expressed genes are transcribed only when prompted (e.g., in response to receptor binding by a hormone or growth factor) or to cellular perturbations as in neoplastic transformation (see Chapter 6). Tissue-specific genes are expressed only in a particular tissue such as the gene for galactocerebrosidase in myelinating cells of the nervous system (see section on Globoid Cell Leukodystrophy in Chapter 14).

In nuclear DNA each chromosome consists of a DNA double helix; in other words, each chromosome is a long, linear double-stranded DNA molecule, and the genome (and genes) consists therefore of DNA molecules totaling billions of nucleotides (pyrimidines: cytosine [C], thymine [T], uracil [U, found in RNA in place of T in DNA]; purines: adenine [A] and guanine [G] ).

The RNA carrying the coded information, called mRNA, is then transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where the RNA sequence is decoded, or translated, to determine the amino acid sequence of the protein gene product. The key to translation is the nucleotide sequence along the mRNA. Each set of three nucleotide bases (the triplet codon) in the mRNA encodes a particular amino acid that is inserted into the forming protein molecule during translation. In theory, an almost infinite variation in the arrangement of the bases along a polynucleotide chain is possible. The process of translation occurs on ribosomes, both free in the cytoplasm and on rER. Ribosomes consist of many different structural proteins in association with rRNA and have binding sites for all the interacting molecules of translation, including mRNA and tRNA.

Most mutations are not perpetuated because cells have reparative mechanisms (i.e., base excision repair, nucleotide excision repair, and mismatch repair) and DNA repair proteins that correct mistakes caused by mutagens or other factors (E- Fig. 1-24 ). These repair mechanisms and proteins determine which nucleotide bases are paired incorrectly and then replace the incorrect base with chains, the addition of carbohydrate moieties (e.g., glycosylation), or proteolytic cleavage of polypeptides (e.g., the conversion of proinsulin to insulin). The polypeptide chain that is the primary translation product is also folded and bonded into a specific threedimensional structure determined by its amino acid sequence. Two or more polypeptide chains, products of the same or different genes, may combine to form a protein complex. Thus it has been estimated that 20,000 genes can encode as many as a million different proteins. The proteome includes all the proteins of a cell (cellular proteome), tissue, or animal (complete proteome). Individual proteins in a proteome do not function in isolation. They form elaborate networks, involving many different proteins and respond in a coordinated fashion to many different genetic, developmental, or environmental signals such as those that occur in homeostasis and in cellular adaptation, injury, aging, and neoplasia.

During the clinical management of cancer, such mutations can serve as a means to detect the growth of a tumor and monitor its response to therapy. Figure 1 -29 Sequence of Events in Tumorigenesis. There are approximately 220 types of somatic cells in an animal's body. During their lifespan, somatic cells can divide up to 50 to 60 times. If they do not express telomerase, their telomeres are significantly shortened. A telomere is a region at the end of each chromatid that protects the end of the chromosome from deterioration and/or from fusion with adjacent \"aged\" chromosomes. In the presence of active checkpoints, cells become senescent. If these checkpoints fail, DNA-repair pathways are inappropriately activated and result in the formation of dicentric chromosomes. During mitosis, dicentric chromosomes are pulled apart, leading to random double-stranded breaks in affected chromatids. In response, DNA-repair pathways are again activated, resulting in the formation of additional dicentric chromosomes. Cells that go through repetitive sequences of this \"bridge-fusion-breakage\" cycle have substantial chromosomal instability and numerous mutations. Subsequently, if affected cells fail to express telomerase, they eventually die. If they express telomerase, the cells can escape the \"bridge-fusion-breakage\" cycle.

Examples of autosomal dominant disorders in animals include polycystic kidney disease (see Fig. 11 -26, F), osteogenesis imperfecta (see Chapter 16), and chondrodysplasia (see Fig. 16-39) . In autosomal dominant disorders, most mutations lead to reduced production of a protein or give rise to an inactive protein. The clinical effect of these loss-of-function mutations depends on the activity of the protein affected. If such mutations involve an enzyme, heterozygotes may be clinically normal because the normal allele can compensate for up to a 50% loss of enzymatic activity. In contrast, autosomal dominant disorders have serious effects on structural proteins, such as collagen or spectrin, even in heterozygotes with one normal allele. A 50% reduction in the amount of such proteins results in abnormal structure and assembly of collagen, and a spectrin deficiency causes osmotic fragility of erythrocytes and hereditary spherocytosis in golden retriever dogs.",

Thus cells with large ATP requirements tend to be the ones most seriously affected by mitochondrial diseases. Because mtDNA encodes enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, mutations affecting these genes exert their deleterious effects primarily on the organs most dependent on oxidative phosphorylation such as the CNS, skeletal muscle (type II myofibers), cardiac muscle, liver, and kidneys. For example, the CNS produces approximately 20% of the body's total ATP and therefore is most often affected by mtDNA mutations.

The biologic significance of meiosis and mitosis lies in ensuring the constancy of chromosome number and thus the integrity of the genome from one cell to its progeny and from one generation to the next. The medical significance of these processes involves errors of cell division, which lead to the formation of an individual cell or of a cell lineage with an abnormal number of chromosomes and thus an inappropriate amount of genomic material. Such errors are called nondisjunctions and represent a failure of chromosome pairs to disjoin (separate) during cell division, and as a result both chromosomes go to one cell and none to the other. Meiotic nondisjunction, particularly in oogenesis, is a common mutational mechanism, responsible for chromosomally abnormal fetuses. In those fetuses that survive to term, chromosome abnormalities cause developmental defects, failure to thrive, and reduced mental function. Mitotic nondisjunctions can also be inherited. Nondisjunction soon after fertilization, either in the developing embryo or in extraembryonic tissues like the placenta, leads to chromosomal mosaicism that can be the basis for some genetic disorders. Additionally, abnormal chromosome segregation in rapidly dividing tissues can be a step in the development of tumors.",

One cause of aneuploidy is nondisjunction during meiosis (E- Fig. 1-31) , resulting in either extra chromosomes (e.g., trisomy, tetrasomy) or one less chromosome (i.e., monosomy) (see E- Fig. 1-31) . Fertilization of such ova by normal spermatozoa results in two types of zygotes, trisomic (or tetrasomic) or monosomic. Trisomic or tetrasomic offspring are extremely rare in domestic animals, but an autosomal trisomy has been reported in an Italian Friesian calf with malformed limbs, congenital opisthotonus, brachygnathia, blindness, and absence of external genitalia.

In the division of the fertilized ovum, an error may lead to one of the daughter cells receiving three sex chromosomes, whereas the other receives only one, yielding, for example, an n-1, X/n+1, XXX mosaic. All cells derived from each of these cells will have the same abnormal karyotype. An example of X (sex) chromosome mosaicism occurs in tortoiseshell and calico (tricolored) cats. In all female mammalian cells, the function of one X chromosome is inactivated through a random process called X chromosome inactivation. Approximately 50% of the cells of tricolored cats have inactivated paternal X chromosomes; the other 50% have inactivated maternal X chromosomes. Thus female tricolored cats have roughly equal populations of two genetically different cell types and are therefore a type of mosaic that is expressed in the patterns of hair coloration (orange, black, and white).",

Thus, unlike the single-mutant gene disorders (discussed previously) that commonly cause disease and give rise to mendelian-inherited disorders, each individual polymorphism has a small effect and rarely causes disease by itself. Because environmental interactions are important in the pathogenesis of these diseases and the complex traits do not follow a mendelian pattern of inheritance, the genes and polymorphisms that contribute to these diseases have been very difficult to determine. Assigning a disease to this mode of inheritance must be done with caution. Diagnosis of diseases that are considered complex multigenic disorders such as type 1 diabetes (a known human complex multigenic disorder) depends on many factors and the exclusion of mendelian (single-gene) and chromosomal modes of transmission.

Base excision repair can be used at any point in the cell cycle and is important in removing damaged bases that could cause mutations by mispairing or lead to breaks in DNA during replication. Nucleotide excision repair mends DNA damaged by chemicals, UV radiation, or other mutagens that cause formation of DNA adducts (DNA covalently bonded to a chemical). DNA mismatch repair mends erroneous insertion, deletion, or mismatched base pairs. (Courtesy Dr. M.A. Miller, College of Veterinary Medicine, Purdue University; and Dr. J.F.

            "text": "the correct one(s). The effects of mutations can be considerable if not repaired by one of these mechanisms. Mutations of the genes for DNA repair proteins also can have serious outcomes, especially in neoplastic transformation of somatic cells.Single-gene disorders arise from a mutation in one gene and result in a permanent change of the cell's nuclear DNA (E-Figs. 1-25 and 1-26). Such mutations can affect protein synthesis by disrupting one or more steps in transcription or translation and lead to the following: 1. The formation of an abnormal protein 2. A reduction in the amount of protein synthesized 3. The formation of abnormal proteins without impairing any step in protein synthesis 4. Modification in the rate of synthesis, posttranslational mechanisms, or transporting of proteins out of the cell Virtually any type of protein may be altered in single-gene disorders with the following adverse effects: 1. Enzyme defects (i.e., lack of function) 2. Defects in membrane receptors and transport systems 3. Alterations in the structure, function, or quantity of nonenzyme proteins 4. Unusual reactions to drugsIn enzyme defects, mutations may result in the synthesis of a defective enzyme with reduced activity or in a reduced amount of a normal enzyme. An enzyme defect may have deleterious effects by allowing intracellular accumulation of a substrate(s) or of products of an alternative pathway. Such metabolic by-products can be cytotoxic. An enzyme defect can also disrupt a metabolic pathway, resulting in insufficient end product for normal function.Mutations resulting in the accumulation of complex substrates or the blockage of metabolic pathways are best illustrated by a group of diseases called storage diseases, in which defective processing of a metabolic substrate leads to the accumulation of the substrate in the cytoplasm or within lysosomes. Such diseases are discussed in the Pathology of Organ Systems chapters of this book (especially see Chapter 14). Storage diseases are commonly grouped as lysosomal storage diseases and glycogen storage diseases. Lysosomal storage diseases are characterized by a deficiency of lysosomal acid hydrolases with incomplete breakdown of their substrates, leading to accumulation of the partially degraded insoluble metabolite within lysosomes (E- Fig. 1-27) . Lysosomal acid hydrolases break down a variety of complex macromolecules derived from the metabolic turnover of organelles or acquired from outside the cells by phagocytosis. Stuffed with incompletely digested macromolecules, the lysosomes become large and numerous enough to interfere with normal cell functions. Lysosomal storage diseases are exemplified by globoid cell leukodystrophy, in which a functional deficiency in lysosomal galactocerebroside \u03b2-galactosidase (galactosylceramidase) results in the accumulation of galactocerebroside in macrophages recruited into the CNS (see Chapter 14 and Fig. 14-64) .Glycogen storage diseases (glycogenoses) are caused by a deficiency of an enzyme involved in the synthesis or degradation of glycogen (E- Fig. 1-28 ; see Fig. 14-63) . In glycogenosis type III (Cori's disease), deficient function of an amylo-1,6-glucosidase (debranching enzyme) results in the accumulation of a structurally abnormal glycogen within hepatocytes.Other examples of single-gene disorders include X-linked muscular dystrophy, some types of collagen dysplasias, and drug transporter dysfunction. X-linked (recessive trait) muscular dystrophy (Duchenne's type) occurs in a variety of dog breeds and is characterized by defects in the dystrophin gene, which codes for a membraneassociated cytoskeletal protein in skeletal and cardiac muscle (see Chapter 15). In the absence of dystrophin, muscle fibers are more",
