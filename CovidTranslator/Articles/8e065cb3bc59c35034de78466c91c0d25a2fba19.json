As such, any two real-space projections will intersect along a line (the common line) in Fourier space. Every icosahedral particle has 37 selfcommon lines and these can be used to determine the icosahedral orientations of a set of particles on a per particle basis. As self-common lines are computed for projections of the same particle, this process is highly sensitive to the preserved icosahedral symmetry of a particle, and noise present in each single particle image. Similar to selfcommon lines are cross common lines which are described for a pair of particles as opposed to just a single particle, making it possible to define a maximum of 60 cross common lines for any two icosahedral particles. Cross common line-based particle orientation refinement is advantageous because the magnitude of possible cross common lines reduces the detrimental effect noise has in the self-common lines approach.",

In single particle data collection, individual virus particles on the grid are imaged only once, and it is the collection of thousands of these images that is used to reconstruct the virus ( Figure 2 ). In cryo-ET, a single area of a grid containing many viral particles is imaged multiple times, at a variety of tilt angles, and it is the combination of these images that is used to generate a tomogram and subsequently an averaged density map ( Figure 3 ). Although single particle data collection is often used for subnanometer resolution structural studies, in the case in which either structural or conformational non-uniformity exists (e.g., viral infection of a cell), tomography proves a more fruitful endeavor. Regardless of the technique used, implicit in each of these techniques is the need to process the raw data, and although the means of doing so are quite unique, the basic principle of aligning and averaging the data remains the same.",

Because cryo-EM provides a projection of the virus onto the recording medium, the lack of an even distribution in the 3-D orientation of the particles can introduce bias when reconstructing the data. Accordingly, a single particle imaging session should result in the collection of a series of 2-D images that taken together offer a well-sampled view of the many different orientations of the particles. The process of single particle reconstruction involves isolating each viral particle from a set of images, determining its orientation and center, and then using this information to stitch the data back together into a single 3-D representation of the virus.",

In the presence of structurally diverse samples, a technique that can capitalize on the information content of just a few particles of similar or identical conformation is needed. The theory behind tomography is that by collecting a series of images from a sample, at a variety of tilt angles, it is possible to reconstruct a 3-D volume density from the 2-D projections (Figure 3(a) ). 23, 24 This approach allows for a great deal of low-resolution 3-D information to be extracted from the handful of particles in the tomogram. Under standard tomographic imaging conditions, a series of 71 images are taken from \u00c0 701 to 701 at a step size of 21 (601 and 801 tilt holders are available as well). These images can then be aligned to each other using fiducial markers present in the images (Figure 3(b) ), from which a volume (a tomogram) can be extracted (Figure 3(c) ). 25 From this volume, it is possible to extract individual subtomograms corresponding to each of the particles. These subtomograms can then be classified, aligned, and averaged to obtain a single 3-D model. [26] [27] [28] One consideration for tomography is the high dose that the sample receives during the tilt-series imaging. In single particle data collection, the sample is often subjected to between 20 and 25 electrons per \u00c5 2 per micrograph. 20, 29 In tomography, however, because a single area of the grid is imaged approximately 70 times, the sample is subjected to far more radiation, making damage a consideration. In general, during tomography, the dose per image is set to a point at which the total dose per tomogram (71 images) is between 80 and 100 electrons per \u00c5 2 . 27 Even at this dose level, radiation damage begins to become an issue and will limit the maximum achievable resolution through this technique. 30, 31 Therefore, in order to limit the total dose delivered in a single tomogram, on average, the dose per image must be reduced to nearly 1/20th of what is commonly used for a single particle micrograph. Lowering the total dose per image reduces the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the data and effectively lowers the maximum attainable resolution from the data, the gain from 'dose fractionation' notwithstanding. 32 Due to the manner in which a single tomographic series is recorded, the maximum resolution achieved so far with these techniques only approaches the nanometer threshold, 33 which is far below the current standard set by the single particle approach. 4-11",

Images with obvious aberrations, such as drift, vibration, and astigmatism, should not be considered for further processing. (c) Once the data have been screened, the particles in the image can be boxed. Depending on the program used, boxing can be done either manually or automatically; caution must be observed when autoboxing because the algorithms are not 100% specific. (d) After boxing, the CTF of the data in the boxed particles must be CTF corrected. Accurate CTF correction is necessary for high-resolution reconstruction. (e) The final, and most computationally intensive, step in image processing is reconstruction. In this step, the orientations for each of the particles are approximated and then refined. Finally, all of the data are combined to produce a 3-D model. 3 Figure 3 Schematic of tomographic data collection. (a) During tomography, the grid holder is rotated across its maximum tilt range ( \u00c0 701 to 701 shown), and a single low-dose image is typically taken every two degrees (the step size), resulting in a total of 71 images (for a 701 holder). (b) Gold nanoparticles (enlarged view shown in yellow) are typically used as fiducial markers. Gold is an ideal marker because even in lowcontrast images, the gold appears as an extremely electron-dense object, making it easy to identify. Tracking fiducial markers through a tilt series allows each of the individual images that comprise the tomogram to be aligned with respect to each other, facilitating tomographic reconstruction (c) and subvolume extraction. Although the object of interest in this tomogram (the cell with the virus attached) appears to move as the sample is tilted, this is an artifact of sample rotation and is corrected for by aligning the gold fiducials across the series of images. are practiced routinely. 24, 34, 35 One of the first decisions the electron microscopist must make concerns what microscope to use -specifically, what voltage should be used. For the purpose of virus reconstruction, the two most commonly used voltages are 200 and 300 kV. The major differences between these two voltages concern contrast and depth of field. Although the 200-kV microscope has slightly better contrast, it has a smaller depth of field. Contrast is less of an issue for viruses, but the differences in depth of field between the two voltages become a consideration for large viruses where the top and bottom of the virus particles are no longer at the same defocus. 21 For these reasons, 300-kV electron microscopes are the instrument of choice for high-resolution structural studies. Electron images are convoluted by the contrast transfer function (CTF) and the envelope function of the electron microscope. 35 Due to the oscillating nature of the CTF in frequency space, there are zeros of the function at different frequencies for a given defocus (see Section 1.16.6.3). To reconstruct an unknown virus from low to high resolution, it is necessary to collect the data at varying defocus ( Figure 4 ) so that the merged images will have no information gap up to the targeted resolution of the reconstruction. Because the apparent image contrast is higher at higher defocus, high-defocus/highcontrast images are ideal for building an initial model for a reconstruction because the data contain low-resolution details. However, the usefulness of these high-defocus images is limited by the fact that for some instruments, at high defocus, the SNR rapidly decreases with increasing spatial frequency (Figure 4 (d)) due to the spatial coherence of the electron gun. As a result, the same images used to determine an initial model are generally not ideal for high-resolution reconstructions because they have less signal at high spatial frequencies. Traditionally, viruses were imaged at a large defocus (43 mm), optimized for good low-resolution contrast, which made it 1.0 \u00b5m defocus 3.2 \u00b5m defocus Figure 4 Defocus contrast enhancement. Low-frequency contrast is extremely useful for particle alignment, but it comes at the cost of high-resolution information, which is lost as a function of the exponentially decaying envelope function. (a) Contrast enhancement due to defocus can be seen in the real images collected on the electron microscope. Although the 'real image' data taken at a high defocus (3.2 mm) appear to be sharper, this is a reflection of the low-resolution contrast enhancement obtained by defocusing the image and does not necessarily make it more useful for the purposes of reconstruction. (b) The difference in defocus is also visualized in Fourier space, where the image taken closer to focus has broader thon rings that extend further outward in Fourier space. (c) At 1.0 mm defocus (blue line), the second CTF zero in the rotationally averaged FFT is pushed out to a spatial frequency that is nearly as far as the signal extends for the 3.2-mm defocus micrograph (red line), illustrating how low defocus images contain more high-resolution (high spatial frequency) data. To ensure that one has a complete data set that can be reconstructed to a subnanometer resolution, it is important to have data collected across a broad range of defocuses -high defocus for initial model generation and low defocus for high-resolution reconstructions. (d) A further complication of high-defocus images is the rapidly decaying envelope that limits the information content (signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) of these images. The point at which the SNR of the data collected at these two defocus values falls below 0.05 is a reflection of the diminished information content of high-defocus images.",

However, to address the issues of poor contrast in the transmitted electron beam, while preserving high-resolution features, energy filtering has been implemented in the workflow of data collection. 39, 40 By filtering the transmitted beam, it is possible to exclude electrons that were inelastically scattered by the sample, thus enhancing the contrast of the resulting image, especially at low defocus ( Figure 5 ). Energy filters are becoming more commonplace in cryo-EM, and they have been used to solve structures at resolutions of approximately 4 \u00c5 . 5, 10, 41 The final step in data collection is choosing which medium to use to record data. Not long ago, photographic film was the only medium for data collection, but advances in fabrication techniques have resulted in the development of charge-coupled devices (CCDs) capable of recording images from electron microscopes. Due to improvements in the scintillators used on the new generation of CCD cameras, CCDs have started to replace film as the preferred medium for data collection, even for near-atomic resolution reconstructions. 9, 11, 42, 43 Inherently, CCDs have many advantages compared to photographic film; some of the most notable advantages are high contrast at low frequency, instantaneous assessment of data quality, and elimination of the labor-intensive process of film development and digitization. Like any recording medium, CCD cameras have their own modulation transfer function, and it is possible to empirically determine the retrievable resolution of these devices by estimating the frequency at which the SNR in images of amorphous carbon falls below 5% ( Figure 6) . Previous work has shown that depending on the CCD used,",

Although a digitized film negative requires approximately 100 MB to store (assuming a 9-mm per pixel resolution), the raw data (the negative) can be stored indefinitely in a low-humidity, light-free environment. Alternatively, data from a CCD exist solely as a digital file and must be maintained as such. The data storage requirements of a single micrograph collected on CCD depend directly on the size of the CCD. The first CCDs used for biological applications were 1-megapixel (MP) cameras that required 4 MB of storage per frame. 45, 46 These were followed by 4-MP, 47 16-MP, 44 ,48 and 100-MP cameras requiring 16, 64, and 480 MB of storage per frame, respectively. Although the cost of data storage is relatively low (currently less than $0.10 per GB), a single session on the microscope can result in the collection of between 26 and 192 GB, depending on the CCD camera used and the number of images collected. One effect of this growing trend toward higher megapixel CCDs is the nearly exponential growth in stored data. Fortunately, data storage capabilities have grown exponentially during approximately the past decade, making it possible to store all of these data. Nevertheless, as higher resolution reconstructions are sought, the amount of data storage required for these reconstructions may exceed local resources. Although the cost of digital collection and short-term storage is far less than that of film development, the need to maintain the data electronically with a high level of fidelity for an indefinite amount of time reinforces the need for a local centralized electronic database for electron micrographs. Database prototypes have been developed that take advantage of the rich amount of metadata implicit in the collection of just a single CCD frame. 49, 50 In addition to providing a central repository for data storage and archive, these databases can archive all the metadata related to each CCD frame in terms of the microscope lens parameters, cryospecimen preparation parameters, and also biochemical purification procedures. 50 Furthermore, these databases should prove to be a useful tool for data organization, retrieval, and dissemination ( Figure 7 ). Although not a requirement for the cryo-electron microscopist, these local databases provide an excellent means for investigators to store their data securely and visualize their data via the Internet.",

By excluding obviously bad images from the reconstruction, one can reduce the number of particles that could otherwise yield confounding or perhaps erroneous results.

The only parameters under control during the boxing process are the box size with which the individual particles are boxed and the position of these boxes with respect to particles they 'box.' It is important to note that an adequate box size in addition to reasonable box centering When an image is free of aberrations, the signal will appear as a series of concentric rings extending outward from the center of the FFT. (b) Astigmatism appears as elliptical rings in the FFT of an image and has the tendency to flatten out a rotationally averaged power spectrum, making it difficult to fit the CTF for astigmatic data. Astigmatism is an aberration of the illumination source, and because subtle differences in the sample can affect astigmatism, it is important to correct this aberration in the objective lens system while the sample is in place. (c) Drift occurs when the sample is moving during the time of exposure. Drift is often the cause of thermal instability, or not allowing the stage to come to rest after moving it. The characteristic feature of drift is symmetric degradation of the FFT across all spatial frequencies. (d) Vibration is the most insidious aberration because it can be of a physical or an acoustic etiology. Although at first glance vibration appears similar to drift in the FFT, it differs from drift in that it tends to occur at specific spatial frequencies, effectively degrading the signal beyond that resolution.

Furthermore, care must be taken in choosing the desired box size because a box that is just a single pixel smaller or larger than optimal can have a dramatic effect on the speed with which the data are processed. In general, the box size is set to be approximately 1.5 to 1.75 times the size of the particle so as to ensure that there is adequate background in the box to generate a noise profile for each particle for accurate CTF correction, alignment, and refinement. Programs are available (e.g., EMAN and EMAN2) that simplify this process by allowing the user to view individual micrographs, select particles, and export the single particle images. 51, 52 However, caution must be exercised because the process is neither 100% specific or sensitive in any software. Furthermore, if a sample is not 100% homogeneous, the automatic boxing programs may inappropriately include other particles of the same shape and size. Therefore, it is recommended that automatic selection be followed by an additional round of manual inspection so as to exclude any erroneously selected particles and include those particle missed by the autoboxing algorithm ( Figure 9 ). The advantage of using an autoboxing program is that all of the boxes are automatically centered on the selected particles, a process that is very labor-intensive if performed manually. Because it is easier to delete boxes generated by the autoboxing programs than it is to manually select and center boxes, it is recommended that the threshold for autoboxing be set low enough to box all features in a micrograph. The same discretion that is used in image screening should also be used when boxing or inspecting boxed particles. Features such as charging 53 that may not be readily visible in the power spectrum of an entire micrograph may become apparent when viewing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of an individual particle, in which case the particle should either not be selected or be deleted.",

One of the most laborious, and important, tasks in any cryo-EM experiment is fitting the CTF of one's data.

(Left) When e2boxer is used to automatically box particles in an image, it does a good job of selecting and centering around particles in the micrograph. Although the automatic selection algorithm does not select every particle in the micrograph, the sensitivity can be turned up to catch these particles. However, caution must be used to avoid making the algorithm so sensitive that it begins to falsely select particles. (Right) After running the autoboxing algorithm, it is possible to manually edit the particles selected by e2boxer. In the case of herpes simplex virus type I, when different capsid types are present in the micrograph, it is important to manually select those missed by the autoboxer (yellow box) and remove those of a different type (red boxes). From Tang may be advantageous to extend this to every particle in a single image frame because variations in ice thickness can allow for multiple focal heights. For any given image, taking a rotational average of the FFT of all the particles in that image produces the CTF. However, depending on the sample and the imaging conditions, SNR becomes an issue when trying to accurately fit a small number of particles, especially when trying to determine the CTF for a small number of particles ( Figure 10 ). In addition, in order to accurately fit the CTF of the data, it is recommended that a structure factor be used during fitting. Structure factors can be computed from X-ray solution scattering 56 or through manual fitting of a subset of the single particle data ( Figure 11 ). The CTF can be fit manually using programs such as ctfit in EMAN, in which the parameters discussed previously are modulated to fit the experimental curve ( Figure 12) . During CTF correction, the parameter that is by far the most sensitive to error is the defocus determined for the individual images. Because phase can be flipped and lost at different frequencies during the imaging process, fitting the defocus parameter in the CTF is a way to attempt to recover this information. The standard method for defocus determination is to correctly identify the 'zeros' in the CTF and fit them accordingly. Because the CTF zeros are less sensitive to defocus at low spatial frequencies, it is important to fit the defocus parameter at high spatial frequencies (as far out as one still has signal) so as to ensure that one does not flip the phase of the experimental data in relation to the fit ( Figure 12 ). For this reason, the best approach to fitting the CTF is to correctly determine the noise profile for a micrograph and then adjust the defocus Intensity Intensity Figure 10 Signal as a function of number of boxed particles. In each window (a-c), the fit CTF (black) is shifted below the raw data (red) to show features of the two curves; in a true fit, the two curves should be nearly superimposed. (a) In a micrograph with 300 particles, when all 300 are boxed, it is relatively easy to fit the CTF for the data. Furthermore, high-resolution data are visible as ripples in the raw data at high spatial frequency in the averaged FFT for all 300 particles. (b) When looking at a subset of 100 of the total 300 particles in the micrograph, it is still possible to fit the raw data out to nearly the same resolution (envelope). (c) When only one particle is boxed, it becomes very difficult to fit the raw data accurately, and there is no guarantee that a fit of the data made by eye is correct. As a result of the error inherent in fitting single particle CTF data, care must be taken to verify the accuracy of single particle CTF measurements.",

In addition to the parameters discussed previously, Fourier amplitude fall-off (known as the envelop function) is another parameter that must be fit for each CTF curve and contributes significantly to the overall signal, especially at high spatial frequencies. Because this fall-off is a function of the instrument, specimen conditions, and the recording medium, it is not expected as a component of the theoretical CTF shown in eqn [1] . As such, for the purposes of CTF fitting, the effective envelope function can be assumed to decay as a Gaussian or an exponential function with respect to spatial frequency. A further complication in fitting the CTF of raw data is the presence of astigmatism, and although for most practical applications astigmatism is assumed to be insignificant, it is possible to determine and correct for its presence. 57",

Although this process can be applied to a small number of particles, unless a large number of particles are used, many features -such as preferred orientation, limited defocus range, and noise -keep a reconstruction from reaching high resolution. To circumvent these issues, it has been common practice to use an ever-increasing number of particles. 58 The majority of the subnanometer resolution virus maps that have been published to date assume icosahedral 0.00 0.05 0.10 Spatial frequency Intensity 0.15 0.20 Figure 11 X-ray solution scattering data for herpes simplex virus type I B-capsid.

Programs such as EMAN and EMAN2 have multiple alignment algorithms, from the traditional common lines approach to principal component analysis and projection matching. Although the projection matching algorithm is an approach that has been used to obtain near-atomic resolution structures, 43 it uses an exhaustive search to refine all five alignment variables (the three Euler angles (a, b, g) and the particle's center (x, y)) simultaneously and as such is computationally expensive. On the other hand, the Multi-Path Simulated Annealing (MPSA) algorithm uses an algorithm based on cross common lines in Fourier space and handles model refinement separately from the initial orientation determination. 58 MPSA has been shown to be an effective means for icosahedral virus reconstruction, 6, 16, 58 and because it is approximately 1000 times faster than the exhaustive search described previously, it is extremely efficient for large data sets (a requirement for high-resolution viral reconstruction). Another advantage of MPSA is that unlike other similar reconstruction algorithms, it does not require an accurate initial model, making it possible to reconstruct uniquely shaped viruses de novo (i.e., free of model bias) in minutes Elapsed time: Figure 13 De novo model generation using MPSA. Often, an accurate initial model for a virus is not available, making it necessary to perform a de novo reconstruction of the data. To initialize this process, a random spherical 'initial model' (a and b), with dimensions approximate to that of the data, is used as an initial model. The reported times are based on processing with 100 CPUs operating at 2.66 GHz. (a) and (b) Using MPSA, it is possible to resolve very coarse features of the bacteriophage e15 in as little as 2 min (after two iterations), and a near subnanometer resolution initial model can be generated in less than 1 h (orthoslice (a) and 3-D reconstruction (b)). (c) An FSC plot of these reconstructions shows that by the eighth iteration (after 10 min), the model has converged and the resolution is high enough to use as an initial model for refinement to higher resolutions.",

These alignments were further refined by finding the orientations with the highest cross common line correlation between raw particle images and reference projections from template models. The disadvantage of this approach is that the method decouples the center and orientation search, a problem that becomes an issue in the later steps of refinement. Furthermore, the self common lines approach is highly dependent on low spatial frequency contrast, making it difficult to properly identify the icosahedral orientation of particles imaged with a defocus less than 2 mm. 58 Because close-to-focus image reconstruction was not possible with this algorithm, it was difficult to obtain high-resolution 3-D reconstructions from a single set of images. As an alternative to the self common lines approach for initial particle alignment, cross common line correlation was proposed as a method that could potentially circumvent the problems of the self common lines approach, namely accurate particle center determination and low-frequency contrast dependence. 37 Figure 14 Model refinement of e15 phage using the MPSA algorithm. Once an adequately resolved model for the data has been generated, it is possible to begin refining the individual particle orientations to produce a better resolved model. Refinement is an iterative process that incrementally improves model resolution by fine-tuning particle orientations before reconstruction. Refinement is best performed once the particle's approximate orientations are known as it becomes more computationally efficient to search a smaller orientation space. The successive improvements in the model can be seen in both the reconstructed data (orthoslice (a) and 3-D model (b)) and the FSC computed for the data (c).",

The novelty of this program is that it uses a series of optimization paths that can communicate with each other, effectively allowing each individual path to jump to a point of lower energy identified by another path. This approach has been shown to reduce the computational load of the traditional expensive cross common lines search approximately 1000-fold.

As such, it is necessary for the model to converge to near subnanometer resolutions before attempting to refine the data any further. Once a reasonable high-resolution model of the virus has been generated, it is possible to begin refining the orientations to generate a higher resolution final model. Because refinement is a computationally intensive process, it is typically reserved for finely tuning orientations that are already near their true orientation ( Figure 14) .

When targeting a resolution less than 4.0 \u00c5 , it is necessary to consider correcting these variations on a per micrograph (astigmatism and beam effects) and per particle (magnification, defocus, and tilt) basis. Because the local environment in which each image is collected can produce variations in magnification and astigmatism, these aberrations should be iteratively refined in the final stages of producing a high-resolution reconstruction. 5, 10, 69 In addition, because variation in ice thickness and specimen tilt can position individual particles at different focal distances, applying a global CTF correction for defocus can potentially ablate highresolution features of the data. 3, 69 To compensate for these differences, local refinement of the defocus for each particle in a micrograph can minimize phase flipping at high spatial frequencies and preserve the high-resolution features in the reconstruction ( Figure 12 ). Because the resolution of single particle cryo-EM reconstructions are pushing nearer to atomic resolution, it is likely that further corrections will be necessary to compensate for irregularities in the beam and sample.",

For many viruses, the assumed symmetry is icosahedral; however, due to the nature in which these viruses are built and mature, there are important molecular components in their overall structure that are not symmetric. Accordingly, there has been an increased interest in the determination of the structure of these viruses without imposed symmetry because it will help shed light on the process of viral assembly and maturation. 6, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 70 The assumption of symmetry is often made because it simplifies the process of orientation determination. Furthermore, by icosahedrally averaging a map, the information content of a data set is enhanced, making it possible to achieve highresolution reconstructions with nearly 60 times less data than for a reconstruction in which no symmetry is assumed. 68 The process of orientation determination for an asymmetric reconstruction differs from the traditional symmetric orientation search in that one must be able to identify the non-icosahedral components in the virus particle. 6 In the case of a phage such as P-SSP7, which has a large tail and portal structure, it is conceptually easy to understand how one would determine the asymmetric orientation of the particles because the non-icosahedrally symmetric feature is visible in the raw micrographs (Figure 15(a) ). However, in the case of a virus such as HSV-1 in which the structure does not have such a protruding feature that is readily identifiable in raw micrographs, it is more difficult to find the true asymmetric orientation of the particle (Figure 15(b) ). Once the asymmetric orientation of every particle has been determined, the process of reconstructing the virus asymmetrically is identical to any other reconstruction in which symmetry is assumed.",

Although there is no way to directly control for conformational heterogeneity within your sample, if there are visible differences in the raw particle data, it is possible to ameliorate this problem by selecting subsets of the data (Figure 9 ).

Depending on how well the eucentric height was determined, there may be little or no translational shift in the data. Nevertheless, even if there is little shift across all tilt angles, it is necessary to track the movement of fiducial markers across the entire tilt range. Theoretically, one should need only a handful of fiducial markers in a single tilt series to accurately align the tomogram; however, this is complicated by the fact that at some tilt angles, these markers may become obscured or unidentifiable by other features in the micrograph. For this reason, it is best to have many fiducial markers present in the micrograph so that even at high-degree tilt angles one can still align the tomogram (Figure 3(b) ). Image alignment is performed using a graphical user interface (GUI) computer program that allows the user to identify fiducial markers and track them through the entire stack of images. For alignment and reconstruction, one of the more popular tools is the publically available program IMOD. 75 By relating the fiducial markers to themselves across the entire stack of images in the tomographic tilt series, it is possible to align and extract a 3-D volume representative of the imaged area. Furthermore, because a single tomogram can occupy 10-100 GB of space, it is often trimmed prior to further processing. Eventually, the 3-D volumetric reconstruction can then be used to extract subtomograms for classification, alignment, and averaging. [26] [27] [28] Whereas it is common to correct the CTF in single particle reconstructions, the total dose per micrograph in cryo-ET is so low that accurately correcting the CTF is not trivial. Because tomographic reconstructions are typically targeted at low resolution (o20 \u00c5 ), CTF correction has not normally been included as part of the data processing scheme. Although it is possible to ignore the CTF for most tomographic reconstructions, the manifestation of the limited tilt angle present in tomography introduces another confounding artifact known as the 'missing wedge' and requires the user to address the issues of alignment and the missing wedge during averaging. 28 ",

Because most cryo-holders have a maximum tilt angle of 7701 (although some 801 holders are available), the total coverage for a tomogram is limited to 1401 at best (Figure 17(a) ). Ideally, a tomogram would contain data collected across a full 1801; however, because this is not possible with the currently available cryo-holders, this lack of information from 701 to 901 is manifested as a missing wedge of data in Fourier space (Figure 17(b) and (c) ), and if it is not corrected for, it can distort the final reconstruction. An additional complicating factor is that because the tilt angle for a group of particles in a single tomogram is identical, all the particles have the same missing wedge. However, because the particles are randomly oriented in the sample, each particle has different missing wedge data with respect to its orientation (Figure 17(b) and (c)). Because the missing wedge is manifest as a value of zero in the FFT of the data, calculation of the cross-correlation between two particles can result in the elimination of a great deal of information in Fourier space because cross-correlation involves multiplication by these zeros (Figure 17(c) ). To address the fact that the presence of missing data in the Fourier space can hinder proper alignment of the subvolumes, 27, 28 procedures have been developed to circumvent this problem by normalizing the cross-correlations calculated for two particles at different orientations (Figure 17(f) ). 28 Although this approach has been met with success, there is no guarantee that the missing wedge problem has been solved, especially for high-resolution tomographic reconstructions.",

This process is typically initialized through comparison with an approximate model of the virus. However, in the event that no adequate reference model is available, it is necessary to generate an initial model from the available data. The raw data can be used to generate an adequate initial model by To illustrate the missing wedge problem, the product of the Fourier amplitudes for the data in panels b and c is shown. Because the missing wedge is manifest as a zero value in Fourier space, any multiplication by the missing wedge will eliminate Fourier amplitudes in the data (light red wedges). When the total sum of Fourier amplitudes is used to choose the best orientation of the two particles with respect to each other, the data eliminated by the missing wedge will result in selection of the wrong orientation. In this example, the best orientation (at the bottom) is not selected because the majority of the Fourier amplitudes were eliminated when multiplied by the missing wedge. (e) To minimize the effect of this pitfall caused by the missing wedge, an alternative approach, for orienting two particles to each other, is needed that can circumvent this problem. (f) Computing the Fourier amplitude cross-correlations reveals that the highest correlation belongs to the orientation that maximized the Fourier amplitudes in panel d. Unfortunately orientations determined this way may not be entirely accurate as they tend to be biased by the missing wedge. However, if the cross-correlations are normalized with respect to each other (i.e., by setting the mean \u00bc 0, and standard deviation \u00bc 1), the sharp short peak in the pre-normalized data (orange) is transformed to the tallest peak in the post-normalized data. As a result of this normalization, the true orientation is chosen correctly (g), even though the overall Fourier amplitudes are less than those for other false orientations (h). This process is advantageous because it is less sensitive to the presence of the missing wedge which can obscure accurate orientation determination.",

In light of a standardized method for reconstruction resolution determination, it has been proposed that the effective 'resolution,' as predicted by these approaches, should also take into consideration the resolvability of specific features such as a helices and b sheets, especially those confirmed by crystallography. 9 Although this method of feature based resolution determination is less quantifiable than other resolution assessments, it represents an alternative, more tangible, interpretation of resolution determination as a function of at what resolution the map can accurately describe structural features. To that end, it is possible that two maps with the same resolution, as determined by the FSC criterion, may have different structural features resolved. Furthermore, although calculating an FSC threshold is a common procedure, it is highly sensitive to any postprocessing performed on the map and as such, resolution enhancement via the FSC criterion can occasionally become slightly subjective.",

Traditionally, segmentation is performed manually, 75,84,85 but tools have been developed to automate certain aspects of the segmentation process. These programs use a variety of approaches, such as watershed 86 and principal component analysis 87 or multiscale segmentation, 88 to identify individual protein components in the virus.

Although Coot and Pymol have good visualization tools for atomic resolution density maps of moderate-size proteins, their usefulness is limited for larger whole-virus maps composed of hundreds to thousands of proteins. Therefore, Chimera and Amira are typically used to visualize these maps because they can handle large amounts of data more efficiently. Amira is a complete package for visualization and segmentation, but it has a few limitations in terms of cost and a relatively steep learning curve. Alternatively, Chimera is freely available and a good tool for simultaneous visualization of both density maps and PBD models. 4, 6, 14 Both these programs can be used to make publication-worthy animations of specific features of a map. However, high-end computer animation and visual effects software such as Maya (http://usa.autodesk.com) can be used to enhance the quality of these animations. Regardless of the size of the map with which one is working, either a cropped region containing the asymmetric unit or the whole map, visualization and segmentation should be performed on a multicore multiprocessor computer with large amounts of both physical and video memory.

Perhaps the most important of these non-icosahedrally arranged proteins, for the viral life cycle, is the genome packaging apparatus (portal) located at one of the 12 fivefold vertices in dsDNA viruses ( Figure 20) . 6, 14 During icosahedral reconstruction, asymmetric features such as the portal are averaged out across the entirety of the map. To adequately resolve these features, it is necessary to implement a reconstruction scheme that does not assume symmetry. As a result of this asymmetric approach, reconstructions require approximately 60 times as many particles to achieve an equivalent icosahedral resolution. A comparison of the structures of viral particles both with and without DNA has elucidated one mechanism of DNA release. 6 In the case of P-SSP7, a valve in the nozzle protein (through which the viral DNA travels) opens and triggers this release. This event is synchronized with a conformational change in the tail spikes, in addition to the loss of core proteins (Figure 20(c) ). To date, asymmetric reconstructions have yet to reach the resolutions seen when icosahedral symmetry is assumed (o4 \u00c5 ). Nevertheless, the potential to extend these reconstructions to higher resolutions remains feasible as larger data sets become available and reconstruction algorithms continue to mature.",

Although subnanometer resolution reconstructions have become the rule, not the exception, for single particle cryo-EM, its use for studying pleomorphic particles such as HIV, influenza, and severe acute respiratory syndrome is limited. Because HIV is an enveloped virus, its outer surface consists of a variety of glycoproteins and so there is no guarantee that the individual particles are the same shape or size, even though they appear to be so in cryo-EM. As a result of this size heterogeneity and the possibility for variation in the number of glycoproteins in the envelope, cryo-ET is the only feasible approach for studying these particles. As discussed previously, the use of cryo-ET limits the maximum achievable resolution for a reconstruction. However, a few studies have pushed this resolution limit to 20 \u00c5 and below for a few structural elements of HIV. 26, 33 To address this issues, the process of CTF correction, often employed during single particle cryo-EM, has been used on tomographic data to resolve the Gag lattice of HIV to approximately 17 \u00c5 ( Figure 21 ). 26 Cryo-ET has also been used to resolve the individual gp120 trimers on the surface of the HIV virus. 33",

Fortunately, after extensive data processing and reconstruction, it becomes possible to resolve these featuresin some instances at near-atomic resolutions. Although most of this work has been augmented by image processing techniques that computationally enhance image contrast, advances in fabrication techniques have enabled the microscopist to do so directly by altering the optics of the electron microscope. One such approach, conceived more than a half century ago, works by introducing a p/2 phase shift in the scattered electrons with respect to the unscattered electrons. 94 Although not possible in electron microscopy with materials at that time, this is now accomplished by introducing a thin carbon-film phase plate in the back focal plane of the objective lens. This technique, also known as Zernike phase contrast electron microscopy, is technically challenging due to the difficulty in implementing and maintaining such a device, but the possibilities of its application are tremendous. Although many devices have been proposed for this application, 55,95,96 thin carbon-film phase plates have already begun to show promising results. 16, 97, 98 As a result of the high contrast in these images, it has been shown that one can reduce the data required for a subnanometer reconstruction by a factor of 3 compared with conventional imaging. 16 This approach is particularly advantageous for cryo-ET because a reconstruction from a single tomogram can provide as much detail as reconstruction from approximately 17 000 single particle images of e15 phage. 16 For the purpose of studying virus particles whose structural components have proven intractable to analysis given current methodologies, this new technology is likely to play a key role in addressing questions plagued by structural heterogeneity. Although structural studies of viruses have traditionally been confined to biochemically purified particles, visualizing these viruses infecting their host cells is now possible by cryo-ET. 99 Studies such as that by Chang et al. 99 open the door for investigating the structural rearrangements that occur at the level of the virus throughout the process of infection. The ability to directly visualize a tube spanning the outer membrane of a bacteria ( Figure 22 ) marks the beginning of an era in structural virology in which it is possible to study the interaction of specific virus structures with those of an entire cell.",

During approximately the past 5 years, exciting advances have occurred with regard to how electron microscopy data are produced and collected, in addition to how these data are processed and reconstructed into high-resolution models. For icosahedral reconstructions, the resolutions of these models are quickly approaching that of X-ray crystallography, making it possible to identify primary structural features, firsthand, from within large macromolecular complexes in near-native environments. 5, 11, [100] [101] [102] Furthermore, advances in data processing algorithms have allowed reconstructions, when icosahedral symmetry is not assumed, to finally reach subnanometer resolutions. Although the resolutions of cryo-ET reconstructions have yet to surpass the subnanometer threshold, the breadth of questions that can be addressed with this technology far surpasses that of the single particle approach. Because cryo-ET provides a means to discern heterogeneity at the virus-cell level, it is possible to process the data accordingly. Although these advances appear to have pushed cryo-EM up against the seemingly insurmountable resolution limit set by crystallography, the fact that they have done so in the span of just a few years gives promise for future advancements in the field. Looking forward, considering how the field has evolved in such a short time, both cryo-EM and cryo-ET are likely to have many more surprises in store, not just in technology advancements but also in the scientific discoveries that will result from their application.",
