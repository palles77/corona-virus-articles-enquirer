This in vitro study examined the biological effects of epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), EC 3-gallate (ECG) and EGC 3-gallate (EGCG) in cell lines from human gender-specific cancers. Cell lines developed from organ-confined (HH870) and metastatic (DU145) prostate cancer, and from moderately (HH450) and poorly differentiated (HH639) epithelial ovarian cancer were grown with or without EC, EGC, ECG or EGCG. When untreated cells reached confluency, viability and doubling time were measured for treated and untreated cells. Whereas EC treatment reduced proliferation of HH639 cells by 50%, EGCG suppressed proliferation of all cell lines by 50%. ECG was even more potent: it inhibited DU145, HH870, HH450 and HH639 cells at concentrations of 24, 27, 29 and 30 mM, whereas EGCG inhibited DU145, HH870, HH450 and HH639 cells at concentrations 89, 45, 62 and 42 mM. When compared with EGCG, ECG more effectively suppresses the growth of prostate cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines derived from tumors of patients with different stages of disease.",

Although all epicatechins except EC can potentially suppress cell proliferation (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) , EGCG appears the most promising and is therefore under clinical investigation in chemoprevention trials (19) . However, given the wide range in physiologic potency of the different catechins, an exclusive focus on EGCG is probably short-sighted. EGCG is reportedly more effective than EGC in decreasing the intestinal absorption of cholesterol (20) and it is the most potent catechin inhibitor of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (21) , but ECG has the strongest collagenase inhibitory effect (22) and the highest antioxidant potential (23) . By contrast, only EGC is a potent mediator of oxidative modification and an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase during hepatic catabolism of purines (24) .",

Gupta and others (26) have documented that G 0 /G 1 -phase arrest is independent of p53 mutation, and EGCG treatment of DU145 induces the cyclin kinase inhibitor WAF1/p21.

Our findings confirm an earlier report that used the matrix method to show that ECG is more potent than EGCG in suppressing the proliferation of DU145 CaP cells (4) . Thus reported differences in the relative efficacy of different catechins may not be due to differences in methodology.",

Doubling ECG's IC50 concentration might increase the tumor kill rate if ECG does not epimerize to CG. Our in vitro dose of 100 mM is equivalent to 29 mg (EC/EGC) to 45 mg (EGCG/ ECG), far less than the 100-150 mg (50% of which is EGCG) in one cup of green tea. However, Lee et al. (41) reported that plasma levels of EGCG and EGC in healthy volunteers increased to 78 and 223 ng ml \u00c01 , respectively, 20 min after drinking brewed green tea (1.2 g of tea solids in 200 ml hot water). This suggests that drinking more than 10 cups of green tea may be necessary to maintain a plasma concentration of EGCG equivalent to that used in vitro by a dose of 50 mM or 22.5 mg. Kaegi (42) suggested a daily intake of 13 cups of green tea as a chemopreventive measure. Because this level of tea consumption is impractically high, chemoprevention of cancer with catechins may require administration of the appropriate catechin in a purified form.",

While green tea catechin gallates such as EGCG and ECG possess potent antitumor activities, their epimers, commonly found in black tea, act as potent inhibitor of proteases involved in replication of viruses, including coronoviruses (44) . There is a need to understand preventive and therapeutic potential of catechin gallates from both green and black teas. We are currently designing a phase I chemopreventive study to examine the effects of purified EGCG and ECG in patients who have been chosen observational management of organ-confined prostate cancer.",

These data suggest that the presence of the three adjacent hydroxyl groups (pyrogallol or galloyl group) in the molecule would be a key factor for enhancing the activity.Since reactive oxygen species play an important role in cell death induction, radical scavenging activity was evaluated using the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical. The order of scavenging activity was ECG! EGCG ! EGC ! GC ! EC.The compounds having a galloyl moiety showed more potent activity.
