            "text": "In addition to a characteristic set of essential genes coronaviruses contain several so-called group-specific genes. These genes differ distinctly among the three coronavirus groups and are specific for each group. While the essential genes encode replication and structural functions, hardly anything is known about the products and functions of the group-specific genes. As a first step to elucidate their significance, we deleted the group-specific genes from the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) genome via a novel targeted recombination system based on host switching (L. Kuo, G. J.Godeke, M. J. Raamsman, P. S. Masters, and P. J. M. , J. Virol. 74, 1393-1406. Thus, we obtained recombinant viruses from which the two clusters of group-specific genes were deleted either separately or in combination in a controlled genetic background. As all recombinant deletion mutant viruses appeared to be viable, we conclude that the MHV group-specific genes are nonessential, accessory genes. Importantly, all deletion mutant viruses were attenuated when inoculated into their natural host, the mouse. Therefore, deletion of the coronavirus group-specific genes seems to provide an attractive approach to generate attenuated live coronavirus vaccines. \u00a9 2002 Elsevier Science (USA) ",

In addition to these fundamental elements, however, many viruses specify a diverse collection of proteins, the functions of which are often still unclear, but which are known or assumed to be beneficial to the virus. These proteins may either be essential-operationally defined as being required for virus replication in cell culture-or dispensable. Examples include the cytomegalovirus proteins involved in viral immune evasion through the inhibition of MHC class I mediated antigen presentation and the human immunodeficiency virus Vpu and Nef proteins, which downregulate CD4 surface expression (Emerman and Malim, 1998; Ploegh, 1998; and references therein) .",

Located at the 5\u0408 end of the genome, this replicase gene encodes two large precursors, the many functional cleavage products of which are collectively responsible for RNA replication and transcription. The other common essential genes specify the four basic structural proteins N, M, E, and S. The nucleocapsid (N) protein packages the viral RNA, forming the core of the virion. This nucleocapsid core structure is surrounded by a lipid envelope in which the membrane (M) protein occurs most abundantly. Associated with the M protein are the small envelope (E) protein and the spike (S) protein, the latter forming the viral peplomers that are involved in virus-cell and cell-cell fusion. The genes for these structural proteins invariably occur in the order 5\u0408-S-E-M-N-3\u0408 and are located in the 3\u0408 third of the viral genome (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) .",

Two additional group 2-specific genes, genes 4 and 5a, reside between the S and E genes.

            "text": "For some strains of MHV, the expression of one or more of the group-specific genes has been demonstrated (Ebner et al., 1988; Zoltick et al., 1990) . Indeed, for the best characterized group 2 specific gene product, the HE protein, hemagglutinating and acetyl-esterase enzymatic activities have been demonstrated (Brian et al., 1995) . However, in a number of strains or mutants of MHV particular group-specific genes cannot be expressed, either because of failure to transcribe the corresponding mRNA (Luytjes et al., 1988; or owing to frameshifting (Weiss et al., 1993) or partial (Schwarz et al., 1990) or complete deletion of an ORF. Thus, many of these genes would appear to be nonessential, at least under certain circumstances. However, this question has never been systematically addressed. To study the functions of the group-specific genes, mutational analyses, including their complete deletion, in a controlled genetic background would be required. The necessary tools to accomplish this have been devised only relatively recently. While for some time a method based on targeted RNA recombination, developed for MHV, was the only such system described , other reverse genetic procedures for coronaviruses are now becoming available as well. These procedures use full-length infectious cDNA clones assembled into bacterial vectors (Almazan et al., 2000) or poxviral genomes (Thiel et al., 2001) or assembled in vitro (Yount et al., 2000) .",

To this end we established a novel targeted RNA recombination system, which uses switching of host cell tropism as a selection principle for the construction of recombinant viruses. The key tool in this procedure is a recently constructed mutant virus, fMHV, in which the gene segment encoding the spike ectodomain was replaced by that of the FIPV S gene (Kuo et al., 2000) . This virus, which grows in feline cells, but not in murine cells, was used as the recombination partner with synthetic RNAs in which the MHV S gene was restored and in which additional intended mutations were engineered. Recom-binant viruses were subsequently selected simply on the basis of reacquisition of the ability to grow in murine cells. Our results demonstrated the efficacy of this selection system and showed that the group 2 specific genes, 2a, HE, 4, and 5a, are not essential for viability but that their deletion led to a significant attenuation of MHV in its natural host, the mouse.",

The following viral deletion mutants were prepared: MHV-\u232c45a, which lacks the ORFs between the S and the E gene; MHV-\u232c2aHE, from which the ORFs located between the 1b and the S genes were deleted; and MHV-min, in which both these deletions were combined (Fig. 1) . As a control an isogenic wild-type recombinant MHV-A59 (MHV-WT) was reconstructed by the same method used to create the mutants. All viruses were generated by using transcription vector pMH54 (or derivatives thereof) from which defective RNAs were synthesized and composed of the genomic 5\u0408 467 nucleotides fused to the 3\u0408 end (approximately 8.6 kb) of the genome (Kuo et al., 2000) (Fig. 1) . For the removal of ORFs 4a, 4b, and most of 5a, a new junction was generated between the S gene and the E gene ( Fig. 1) . A small part of the 3\u0408 end of ORF5a, corresponding to a sequence that was preserved in a natural deletion mutant strain of MHV (MHV-S) was maintained . This sequence contains the oligopyrimidine tract suggested to be important for initiation of E gene translation (Jendrach et al., 1999) . For the deletion of ORFs 2a and HE the transcription vector was extended with the 3\u0408-terminal 1200 bp of the 1b gene, and the 1b sequence was fused to the transcription regulatory sequence [TRS; located at the 5\u0408 end of each gene representing a signal for the synthesis of subgenomic (sg) mRNA (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998) ] that precedes the S gene ( Fig. 1) . After generation of the transcription vectors, the deletions were recombined into the MHV genome by RNA-RNA recombination with the interspecies chimeric virus fMHV (Fig. 1, top) . In this virus the S glycoprotein ectodomain is replaced by that of FIPV, providing this virus with the ability to infect feline cells. By using fMHV as the recipient virus for recombination with donor RNAs carrying the murine S gene, recombinant viruses were easily selected on the basis of their regained natural murine cell tropism (Hsue et al., 2000; Kuo et al., 2000) .",

The genotypes of the recombinant viruses were confirmed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR performed on genomic RNA, as shown in Fig. 2 . To verify the deletion of the ORFs 4 and 5a, the RT step was performed with primer 1092, which is complementary to the 5\u0408 end of the M gene, while the PCR was performed with primers 1261 and 990, which are complementary to the 3\u0408 ends of the E and S genes, respectively. In the case of the MHV-WT recombinant, an RT-PCR product, corresponding in size with the predicted 1328 bp, was observed. As expected, a PCR product of the same length was observed for MHV-\u232c2aHE. In contrast, both for MHV-\u232c45a and for MHV-min much smaller RT-PCR products were detected, the decrease in size corresponding with the deletion of 736 bp. The deletion of ORFs 2a and HE was analyzed in a similar way. The RT step was performed with primer 1127, which is complementary to the 5\u0408 end of the S gene. The PCR was performed with primers 1173 and 1260, which are complementary to the 3\u0408 end of the 1b gene and the 5\u0408 end of the S gene, respectively. Both for MHV-WT and for MHV-\u232c45a the expected PCR products (2409 bp) were detected, which were much bigger than the PCR products detected for MHV-\u232c2aHE and MHV-min. The difference in size corresponded with the deletion of 2158 bp. The transcription vectors from which the defective RNAs were produced in vitro by using T7 RNA replicase are indicated on the left side. Vector pMH54 has been described before (Kuo et al., 2000) . The other vectors were derived from pMH54 as described under Materials and Methods. The arrow at the left end of each vector indicates the T7 promoter; the solid circle represents the polylinker between the 5\u0408-end segment of the MHV genome (denoted 5\u0408/1) and either the HE gene or the 3\u0408 end of the replicase gene (1b), followed by the structural and group-specific genes and the 3\u0408-untranslated region and the polyadenylated segment (denoted together as 3\u0408/A). Group 2 specific genes are represented by gray boxes. Positions of the sequences shown in (B) are indicated by arrowheads. On top, a scheme for targeted recombination using the interspecies chimeric virus fMHV, which only grows in feline cells, is shown. The gene encoding the hybrid S protein containing the ectodomain of the feline coronavirus S protein is indicated by a striped box in the fMHV genome. Recombinant viruses generated by the indicated cross-over event can be selected on the basis of their ability to grow in murine cells. The genomes of these viruses are represented on the right side. The 5\u0408-and 3\u0408-untranslated regions are denoted 5\u0408UTR and 3\u0408UTR, respectively. (B) Sequences in the transcription vectors indicated by the arrowheads in (A) are shown and defined as follows: 1, between the S and the 4a gene; 2, between the S and the E gene; and 3, between the 1b and the S gene. The amino acids encoded by the 3\u0408 ends of the S and 1b genes as well as the initiating methionine encoded by the E and S genes are indicated. The MHV TRS is boxed.

For the reconstructed wild-type virus (MHV-WT), the relative molar amounts of the six sg mRNA species and the genomic (g) RNA were similar to those observed previously for MHV (Hsue and Masters, 1999; Jacobs et al., 1981; Leibowitz et al., 1981; Masters et al., 1994) with one notable exception. The 4-5a/E-M-N sgRNA, which is conventionally denoted RNA4, was much more abundant than previously observed for this species in wild-type MHV (Hsue and Masters, 1999; Jacobs et al., 1981; Leibowitz et al., 1981; Masters et al., 1994) . The increased synthesis of this particular sgRNA is known to result from three nucleotide changes 13, 15, and 18 bases upstream of the consensus transcription regulatory signal, 5\u0408AAUC-UAAAC3\u0408, that precedes gene 4 ( Fig. 1B ) (X. Shen, L. Kuo, and P. S. Masters, unpublished results; Ontiveros et al., 2001) . The three base changes were made in the transcription vector pMH54 to create an Sse8387I DNA restriction site downstream of the S gene (Kuo et al., 2000) . The reason for the transcriptional upregulation caused by these substitutions is currently unclear.",

We therefore used the M protein for this purpose and determined the relative amount of radiolabeled protein that is secreted. As Fig. 4A (right) shows, consistently less M protein was immunoprecipitated from the culture media of MHV-\u232c45a-and MHV-min-infected cells than of MHV-WT-or MHV-\u232c2aHE-infected cells. Quantitation of the results of three independent experiments showed that the relative amounts of the M protein released from MHV-\u232c45a-and MHV-min-infected cellsexpressed as the ratio of extracellular over cell-bound M protein (M outside/inside)-were decreased by approximately 50% (Fig. 4B) , which indicates that less viral particles were produced.",

To our initial surprise, E protein could only be detected in control cells infected with the wild-type MHV-A59 strain from the Utrecht laboratory and not in any of the recombinant virus infected cells (Fig. 4D ). Careful analysis of the sequence of the E gene in the Utrecht MHV-A59 strain revealed that it differs at two nucleotide positions from the E gene in the transcription vector pMH54 (Kuo et al., 2000) (A217G and T230C), which is based on the sequence of the Albany laboratory strain of MHV-A59. These nucleotide changes result in two amino acid substitutions (M73V and L77P). The sequence of the E gene from the Utrecht MHV-A59 is identical to that of MHV-3 (Fischer et al., 1998) . Since the anti-E serum was raised against a fusion protein based on the Utrecht MHV-A59 sequence (Raamsman et al., 2000) , we considered this difference to be the most likely explanation for the lack of E protein precipitation. Indeed, when we substituted the two nucleotides in the E gene of pMH54, the resulting recombinant virus expressed an E protein that could now be precipitated with our anti-E serum to the same extent as the E protein produced by the Utrecht MHV-A59 (data not shown).",

Thus, we determined their virulence. Mice were inoculated intracranially with 5-or 10-fold serial dilutions of MHV-WT, MHV-2aHE, MHV-45a, and MHV-min. Infected mice were observed for clinical signs and lethality. For the recombinant wild-type virus a 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) value of 2.7 \u03eb 10 4 (mean of two experiments) was calculated (Hingley et al., 1994; Reed and Muench, 1938) . This LD 50 value is five to eight times higher than the values that are usually obtained for MHV-A59 lab strains. Although the reason for this difference is not clear, it underscores the importance of taking an isogenic wild-type recombinant virus along. LD 50 values were not able to be calculated for the three deletion viruses, but must be in excess of 2.5 \u03eb 10 5 , the highest concentration inoculated, as none of the mice inoculated with this dose died. Figure 6 illustrates the kinetics of mortality of mice infected with the highest dose inoculated, 2.5 \u03eb 10 5 plaque forming units (PFU), of WT and deletion viruses. While all the animals inoculated with wild-type virus had died by 7 days postinfection, the deletion viruses were highly attenuated, displaying no death and less severe clinical symptoms. Despite the observation of no mortality, all mice infected with the \u232c45a and \u232c2aHE viruses showed clinical signs of hunched posture, disheveled appearance, and waddling gait during the first week postinfection; these symptoms were less severe and observed in fewer mice infected with MHV-min. Thus, all deletion viruses are attenuated relative to wild-type virus; however, the genetically minimized coronavirus seems attenuated more severely than the other deletion viruses.",

We now show for the group 2 coronavirus MHV, using our newly developed strategy of targeted recombination, that these group-specific genes are not essential, since recombinant viruses, from which these group-specific genes were fully deleted, could be easily recovered. While deletion of the 2a/HE gene cluster did not affect growth in vitro, deletion of the 4/5a cluster resulted in viruses that replicated to a 10-fold lesser extent. In addition, our work shows that deletion of the nonessential genes led to significant attenuation of all the viruses when inoculated into mice and therefore provides an attractive approach to generate attenuated live coronavirus vaccines.",

            "text": "Except for the HE protein little is known about the actual proteins encoded by the group 2 specific coronavirus genes, and this holds true as well for the groupspecific proteins of the other groups. The HE protein is a type I glycoprotein, which forms disulfide linked homodimers (Brian et al., 1995 and references therein) . Viruses that express this protein show a second, shorter fringe of peplomers on their virions. For the HE protein hemagglutinating and acetyl-esterase activities have been demonstrated, but the significance of these prop- erties remains to be established. No enzymatic activities have been assigned to the other group-specific proteins. The 31-kDa 2a protein was detected in the cytoplasm of MHV, bovine coronavirus (BCoV), and human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43 infected cells (Bredenbeek et al., 1990a; Cox et al., 1991; Labonte et al., 1995; Zoltick et al., 1990) . The MHV and BCoV 2a proteins share 45% amino acid identity. The BCoV 2a protein was demonstrated to be a phosphoprotein (Cox et al., 1991) , but this modification could not be found for MHV (Bredenbeek et al., 1990a) . While the MHV 2a protein contains a putative nucleotide binding site (Luytjes et al., 1988) , this site is not conserved in the 2a sequence of BCoV and HCoV-OC43. Interestingly, the amino-terminal half of the coronavirus 2a protein has significant sequence identity with the carboxyl-terminal part of the torovirus 1a polyprotein (31-36%) (Snijder et al., 1991) , which is presumably involved in viral RNA synthesis. The same 2a protein domain is also homologous with the carboxyl-terminal domain of the group A rotavirus VP3 protein (20-25%), which is part of the virion core and has capping activity (Chen et al., 1999) . It cannot be excluded that these proteins have additional, common functions. Very little is known about the (putative) gene 4 and 5a products. The expression product of MHV-JHM (but not of MHV-A59) gene 4 has been demonstrated in infected cells (Ebner et al., 1988; Weiss et al., 1993) . This protein is predicted to be an integral membrane protein (Skinner and Siddell, 1985) . It has a strikingly high content of threonine residues outside the hydrophobic region. The putative ORF5a expression product has not been demonstrated in infected cells, and it has been proposed that the actual role of this region is to function as an internal ribosome entry site for the translation of the E protein. No homologies have been found for the putative products of ORFs 4 and 5a with other than group 2 coronavirus-specific sequences.",

Deletion of the 2a/HE gene cluster was without appreciable effect on in vitro viral growth, while viruses lacking the 4/5a cluster reached 10-fold lower titers. Whether this latter effect was at all due to the respective proteins not being produced is unclear. The reduced replication capacity of the \u232c4/5a viruses might simply be the consequence of the deletion per se. These viruses exhibited lower transcription efficiencies for the sgRNAs from which the M and E genes are translated. The effect thereof on the synthesis of the E protein could not be analyzed due to the lack of an appropriate antiserum. However, the reduced synthesis of the sgRNA encoding M correlates with the observed slight but significant decrease in the M protein expression level. In view of the essential role of the M and E proteins in viral assembly (Vennema et al., 1996) , this may well explain the impaired replication capacity of these viruses. A comparable result was observed for the equine arteritis virus. This arterivirus has a similar basic genome organization as MHV and also produces a 3\u0408-coterminal nested set of sgRNAs. A mutation causing a twofold reduction in the amount of sgRNA3 of this virus resulted in a corresponding reduction in the amount of GP3 but in a fourfold reduction of the virus titer (Pasternak et al., 2000) . These results support the notion that corona-and related viruses (i.e., nidoviruses) have evolved to regulate, through the use of sgRNAs, the expression of their polycistronic genome, thus providing them with a mechanism to synthesize their proteins in optimal relative quantities.",

            "text": "In the past a number of coronaviruses have been described that carry mutations in or around one or more of their group-specific genes. While in some cases these mutations were demonstrated in viral genomes isolated directly from the animal, very often it is not clear whether they had been generated during passage of these viruses in vitro. Obviously, the generally high rate of mutation in RNA viruses and, in addition, the high frequency of homologous recombination of coronaviruses would be expected to lead to mutations that we now know not to hinder the replication capacity in cell culture. For example, an efficiently replicating MHV deletion mutant lacking a functional ns2 gene was obtained after extensive in vitro passaging of an MHV-JHM isolate (Schwarz et al., 1990) . The HE locus is highly heterogeneous among MHV strains (Luytjes, 1995; . While the gene is intact in strains JHM and S, MHV-A59 does not express its HE gene as it not only lacks the initiation codon but also a functional TRS (Luytjes et al., 1988) . A spectrum of 3\u0408-truncated HE gene variants was observed in brains of mice inoculated with a MHV-JHM strain (Yokomori et al., 1993) . Similarly, considerable variation has also been found in the ORF 4 region of the group 2 coronaviruses. While a single ORF is located in MHV-JHM (Skinner and Siddell, 1985) and MHV-S , in MHV-A59 gene 4 is disrupted by a frameshift that results in two ORFs, 4a and 4b, of which only 4a is expressed (Weiss et al., 1993) . The MHV-A59 ORF4b is a shorter homolog of the MHV-JHM ORF4. In MHV-S the ORF4 is not expressed due to mutations in the TRS. The BCoV genome also contains two ORFs in this region, whereas in HCoV-OC43 a deletion has left only a small portion of the first ORF (Mounir and Talbot, 1993) . Less heterogeneity has been observed for ORF5a, although a deletion in this region has been observed in MHV-S .",

The genetically minimized coronavirus was attenuated more severely than the other deletion mutant viruses. These observations suggest that the functional significance of the coronavirus group-specific genes relates to their role in vi-rus-host interactions. Considering again these viruses' high frequency of mutation and recombination, these accessory genes would otherwise not have been maintained in the viral genome. However, although deletion of the MHV 2a/HE gene cluster did not affect replication in vitro, viruses lacking the 4/5a cluster replicated to a lesser extent. Therefore, while a functional role for the 2a/HE cluster in vivo seems plausible, the observed phenotypes of the viruses lacking the 4/5a cluster may well be caused by their reduced replication per se. Indeed, a recombinant MHV-JHM in which the gene 4 was genetically inactivated was not attenuated in a murine model of encephalitis (Ontiveros et al., 2001) . Consequently, as a next step to elucidate the significance of the MHV group-specific genes in vivo, these genes should be inactivated by site-specific mutagenesis.",

In addition, creating genetically minimized coronaviruses may generate additional space for the stable insertion of foreign genes. The recent development of various reverse genetic procedures for coronaviruses will also enable the study of the other coronavirus groupspecific genes and will finally pave the way for investigations into the pathogenesis of coronaviruses at the molecular level.",

For the construction of this plasmid a PCR product was obtained from an MHV-A59-derived cDNA clone, pB59 (Fischer et al., 1997) , by using primer 1089 (5\u0408-ACCTGCAGGACTAATCTA-AACTTTATTCTTTTTAGGGCCACGC-3\u0408), which contains a PstI/Sse8387I restriction sequence and a TRS and which is complementary to the sequence just upstream of the E gene, and primer 1092 (5\u0408-CCTTAAGGAATTGAACTGC-3\u0408), which is complementary to the 5\u0408 end of the M gene. The PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions, yielding pXH0803. The PCR product was subsequently excised with PstI and EcoRV and cloned into Sse8387-I and EcoRVtreated pMH54, resulting in pXH\u232c45a. Transcription vector pXH\u232c2aHE lacks ORFs 2a and HE and contains approximately 1200 bp from the 3\u0408 end of the replicase gene fused to the S gene. To construct this plasmid a PCR product was obtained by splicing overlap extension PCR. One PCR product was obtained from another MHV-A59 cDNA clone p96 (Bredenbeek et al., 1990b) using primer 1128 (5\u0408-ACGGTC-CGACTGCGCGCTTGAACACGTTG-3\u0408), which contains a RsrII restriction sequence and is complementary to a region approximately 1200 bp upstream of the replicase stop codon, and primer 1130 (5\u0408-CATGCAAGCTTTATTTGACATT-TACTAGGCT-3\u0408), which is complementary to the 3\u0408 end of the replicase coding region and the TRS region that is located upstream of the S gene. The other PCR product was obtained from pMH54 using primer 1129 (5\u0408-GT-CAAATAAAGCTTGCATGAGGCATAATCTAAAC-3\u0408), which is complementary to primer 1130, and primer 1127 (5\u0408-CCAG-TAAGCAATAATGTGG-3\u0408), which is complementary to a region in the 5\u0408 domain of the S gene. The PCR products were purified, mixed, and used in a PCR with primers 1128 and 1127. The DNA product obtained after the second round of PCR was cloned into pGEM-T Easy, yielding pXH1802. It was excised again with RsrII and AvrII and cloned into pMH54, which had been treated with the same enzymes, resulting in pXH\u232c2aHE. Transcription vector pXHmin contains the replicase 3\u0408 end fused to the S gene and the deletion of ORFs 4a, 4b, and 5a. This vector was constructed by cloning the fragment excised with PstI and EcoRV from pXH0803 into pXH\u232c2aHE, which had been treated with Sse8387I and EcoRV.

LR7 cells were mock infected or infected with recombinant (WT, \u232c45a, \u232c2aHE, or min) viruses or with the Utrecht laboratory wild-type virus (MHV-A59) as indicated on the top of each gel. Cells were labeled for 3 h with 35 S-labeled amino acids starting 5 h postinfection. (A) Both cells (left) and media (right) were prepared and used for immunoprecipitation with the anti-MHV serum K134, and the precipitates were analyzed by SDS-15% PAGE. (B) For quantitative analysis phosphorimager scanning of the amount of radioactivity in the M, S, and N proteins in the dried gels of three independent experiments (as shown in A) was performed. The ratios of the intracellular amount of M and N (M/N) and S and N (S/N) proteins were calculated relative to MHV-WT infected cells and standard deviations are indicated. The ratio of the amount of M protein present in the culture media and in cells (M outside/inside) was also determined. Cells were also prepared for immunoprecipitation with the anti-2a serum UP3 (C) and with the anti-E serum K5379 (D). The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-15% PAGE and SDS-20% PAGE, respectively. The positions of the different proteins are indicated on the right, while the molecular mass marker is indicated on the left of each gel.",
