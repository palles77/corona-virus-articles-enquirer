            "text": "Frequent references are made to the World Bank calculation that the number and proportion of people living on less than US$1 per day has fallen since the late 1980s. However, less is said about this calculation's systematic underestimation of the extent of impoverishment. 4 When a more appropriate $2 per day income threshold is used, even by the World Bank's calculations the number of people living in poverty increased between 1981 and 2001 to about 2\u00b77 billion people. 5 This growth in poverty has been accompanied by a growth in wealth. While the number of people living in poverty in sub-Saharan Africa increased from 289 million to 514 million between 1981 and 2001, the world's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by US$18 691 billion. 6 40% of the world's poorest people account for 5% of global income, while the richest 10%, mostly in high-income countries, account for 54%. 7 Generation of wealth is supposed to lead to alleviation of poverty, but has disproportionately benefi ted a minority of the world's population while impoverishing others. According to the World Commission on the Social Dimensions of Globalisation, the governance of the global economy is \"prejudicial to the interests of most developing countries, especially the poor within them\". 8 The deregulation of fi nance, the global property rights regime, and a winner-takes-all liberalisation of trade are aspects of a form of globalisation that traps many countries and households in poverty. Despite slow increases in development assistance and some debt cancellation, net fl ow of resources from poor to rich countries still work against global health challenges. 9 Although some would argue that issues such as trade and global fi nancial markets fall outside the remit of WHO, we believe that WHO should advocate changes to the macroeconomic and political determinants of ill health if we are to reduce child and maternal mortality, achieve universal access to antiretroviral treatment, and allow all countries to pay their health-care workforce an adequate living wage. Although interventions can be implemented by Ministries of Health to tackle the health-worker crisis, changes to macroeconomic policies will be needed in many countries to increase health-sector spending. WHO could promote comprehensive assessments of global, regional, and bilateral trade agreements for eff ects on health and health systems, and develop a well-resourced unit to carry out such work. As it becomes evident that the growth-led concept of poverty eradication is untenable without an explicit redistribution strategy, 6 WHO must demand further discussion about establishment of new, stable, and sustainable sources of global public fi nancing for health-such as the airline levy introduced by France, which is estimated to be capable of raising about \u20ac200 million per year for health. 10 Others have suggested that attention be focused on the development of an international system to reduce tax evasion, which results in an estimated US$350 billion being lost from public accounts. 11 The launch of a Commission on the Social Determinants of Health in March, 2005, off ers hope that WHO would become more active in assessing the health eff ects of the structures and rules of the global political economy. However, WHO's new Director-General must push the Commission to go beyond assessment and propose what WHO can do to engage with economic and social policy.",

The relative weakness of public-health institutions is illustrated by the 2004 Global Strategy on Diet, Physical Activity and Health, which was toned down because of opposition from the food and beverages industry (whose fi nancial resources far exceed those of WHO and whose interests were strongly represented by US representatives at WHO). 17 One of WHO's challenges will be to help correct the current imbalance between the liberal, pro-market economic dimension of globalisation with a public safety and social dimension.",

            "text": "The Lancet has commented that too many of WHO's programmes are inadequately appraised and allowed to perform suboptimally. However, WHO is not alone in this criticism. Many of its outputs and eff ects have been relatively cost-eff ective and impressive. However, The Lancet hits the nail on the head in calling for WHO \"to act systematically as an accountability instrument for the work of other institutions\" including the World Bank, the Global Fund to fi ght AIDS, TB and Malaria, and the US president's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. 1 Perhaps WHO can raise the bar for improving transparency and independent monitoring of key international agencies involved in promoting health by funding and encouraging academic and non-government organisations to act as critical friends, capable of simultaneously monitoring and supporting the performance of WHO in a transparent manner. WHO should also address documented examples of weaknesses in internal management and administration, such as the absence of coordination between its diff erent departments and programmes; overabundance of doctors relative to nurses, social scientists, economists, lawyers, and political scientists; tolerance of underperforming senior executives; arcane bureaucratic procedures; and poor personnel management practices that have demoralised staff . 20, 21 An equally challenging set of barriers relate to WHO's operating environment. One such barrier is funding arrangements. WHO's core funding has remained static for many years and is currently inadequate, amounting to a tiny fraction of the health spending of high-income member states. Furthermore, more than two-thirds of WHO expenditure arises from conditional, extrabudgetary funds that are earmarked for specifi c projects by contributing countries and other donors. This system makes it diffi cult for WHO to plan and fund a coherent programme of work, and forces departments and divisions to compete with each other (and other organisations) and be susceptible to fragmented, donor-driven agendas.",

For example, some member country delegations have warned WHO to steer clear of macroeconomics and trade issues and avoid reference to terminology such as \"the right to health\". As a result, WHO has taken a weak position on important economic issues. Its guide to the health implications of multilateral trade agreements was watered down following pressure from some governments and the World Trade Organization. 22 The USA forced WHO to sanction and recall an employee from Thailand for drawing attention to a negative aspect of the Free Trade Agreement between the USA and Thailand. 3 Another barrier is the multitude of global health initiatives and agencies with funding and governance arrangements that contribute to a chaotic operating environment for WHO. The time has come for a signifi cant rationalisation of the global health landscape. At least, developing country member states should lobby to capacitate WHO with the mandate and resources for a stewardship role in coordinating the work of offi cial donor agencies and global health initiatives.",

What is your view on this question, and what will you do to rectify the imbalance in disciplines and expertise within WHO?\u2022 The phrase \"Staff are our most important resource\" is commonly stated by leaders when they take offi ce. How will you maximise this most important resource in terms of WHO's work and in relation to staff representation in dealing with management?\u2022 Many argue that there is a particular need to build the capacity of the WHO Regional Offi ce in Africa?
