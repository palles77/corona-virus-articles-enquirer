Virus neutralization (V/N) assays are commonly requested in diagnostic laboratories for the assessment of protective antibodies. However, the visual assessment of viral cytopathic effects by operators to determine antibody titers or for viral quantification is a tedious, subjective and time-consuming process, especially when high volume testing is involved. To improve the ease of testing, a colorimetric virus neutralization and TCID 50 assays were developed and validated in this study using (3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl) Tr-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide) (MTT), a colorimetric agent which measures cell viability. The respective conventional assays were used as the gold standards. An OD cut off value of \u22640.53, selected by receiver operating characteristics analysis, could distinguish between wells with and without CPE accurately. Performance and reproducibility parameters of the colorimetric assays were comparable to the conventional assays. The described methods can reduce testing time in diagnostic laboratories, while significantly improving current protocols.",

It was first detected in the U.S. in 2013 (Chen et al.) . Rapid spread of the virus in a na\u00efve population, in conjunction with the high mortality rate resulted in the loss of about 7 million piglets in the first year alone (Schulz and Tonsor, 2015) . While PEDV has become enzootic in the U.S. now, it continues to pose a significant economic problem to the pork industry. Therefore, the effective detection and diagnosis of PEDV plays a key role in the control of the disease.",

However, conventional tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID 50 ) assays are required for the measurement of infective virus. Plaque assays are useful for the quantification of coronaviruses and to distinguish between strains by plaque morphology. However, they are not used frequently for PEDV, perhaps because laboratory culture of PEDV is tedious due to the strict trypsin requirements. Trypsin is required for the cleavage of receptor-bound PEDV S protein and entry into cells (Park et al., 2011) . In laboratories with a high volume of testing, the manual and visual evaluation of both the TCID 50 , V/N or plaque neutralization assays are tedious to perform, as they involve the manual examination of numerous wells of 96 well plates or counting of plaques in Petri plates by the operators. Visual assessment of numerous 96 well plates can cause eye and neck strain over long periods of time and thus pose a health hazard. Variation can also be introduced due to differences between operators in scoring the wells as positive or negative, introducing subjectivity in testing.",

We have used MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2018.09.003 Received 19 June 2018; Received in revised form 2 September 2018; Accepted 9 September 2018 yl) Tr-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide), a colorimetric agent which measures cell viability. Loss of cell viability is characteristic of virus induced CPE and can be measured by MTT. The reduction of MTT to formazane by cellular dehydrogenases is indicative of the mitochondrial and other enzymatic activity in healthy cells and can be measured as an optical density value with an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (Mosmann, 1983) . Therefore, PEDV-infected cells showing CPE are expected to be less efficient in formazane production when compared to healthy cells. Thus, this study is the first description of a colorimetric assay format for a virus neutralization test for a coronavirus. By employing a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis-based cut-off value to distinguish between wells with and without CPE, the optical density (OD) value output from an ELISA reader could be easily used to score wells, reducing the subjectivity and time involved in visual reading. The improved colorimetric methods had a high level of agreement with conventional assays and can significantly reduce the labor involved in the serological testing of PEDV.",

The true positive rate (sensitivity) and the false positive rate (100-specificity) were plotted at the Y and X axis respectively at different cutoff points for the OD values. The curve obtained is indicative of the sensitivity and specificity of the assay at a given cutoff point. The top left corner, representing the area under the curve (AUC) or accuracy of the test, was 0.931. At the selected cutoff of \u2265 0.53 the specificity was 95%, while the sensitivity was 81% with a p value of < 0.0001. V/N assays determine agreement between the tests, the conventional V/N assay performed as expected since the commercial positive control sample showed high V/N titers while the negative control did not (Table 1) (Ramamoorthy and Singh, 2018) . Following visual assessment of the 96 well plates, MTT was added to the wells and OD values obtained as the read out from the ELISA plate reader. The colorimetric V/ N titer was determined as the lowest dilution at which the wells had an OD value \u2264 the cut off value of 0.53. There was complete agreement between the conventional and MTT V/N assays across the triplicate testing in two replicate assays, indicating high reproducibility with no measured inter or intra assay variation between the two compared tests (Table 1) (Ramamoorthy and Singh, 2018) . There was no statistically significant difference between the groups as assessed by a Student's ttest (p = 0.71). Two-fold differences were noted for the positive control sample between two titrations of replicate 2. This difference is generally accepted to be within the detection limits for V/N assays (Stephenson et al., 2009) or can be attributed to operator error but did not affect agreement between the colorimetric and conventional V/N tests. Similarly, high levels of consistency between the conventional and colorimetric V/N's was evident in the field samples tested with only 4 samples showing a two-fold inter assay variation (Table 2 ) (Ramamoorthy and Singh, 2018) . The negative field samples tested had a titer of 1:2 or > 1:2 in both assays. To test non-specific samples by the V/N assay, serum samples from porcine circovirus strain 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), transmissible gastro-enteritis virus (TGEV) or porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) infected pigs were tested by conventional and colorimetric V/N assays. The PCV2 and PRRSV specific sera were obtained from a previous study (Ramamoorthy et al., 2011) . A pooled sample of sera (N = 5) collected at 28 days post infection was tested in duplicate. The PRCV, PDCoV or TGEV-specific sera were gnotobiotic pig derived antisera provided by Dr. Linda Saif, Ohio State University and were also tested in duplicate. Similar to other studies , detectable neutralization of PEDV with the non-specific controls was not observed in this study.",

Similarly, while ELISA's (Song et al., 2016) are useful in assessing the serological status of animals, the measurement of protective, neutralizing antibody responses are the method of choice for determining vaccine efficacy and the level of protection or cross-protection in a herd. Colorimetric assays, based on MTT, have been previously developed for the titration of other viruses such as parvoviruses (Heldt et al., 2006) and picorna viruses (Andersson et al., 2005) . However, this study is the first description of adaption of the method for V/N assays and for the quantification of PEDV, a coronavirus. The primary advantage of the colorimetric assay is that it can be easily adapted to a high throughput format for use in veterinary diagnostic labs. It also eliminates the subjectivity, labor and time involved in visual examination of TCID 50 or virus neutralization assays for PEDV.",

Similar to previously described findings, a titer 10 4.5 TCID 50 was obtained for the virus culture used for optimization of the MTT 50 colorimetric assay. Few other published studies describe the use of the plaque method for PEDV quantification, probably because of the tedious nature and longer turnaround time of the assay (Hofmann and Wyler, 1989; Oka et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015) . In this study, a titer of 10 6 PFU was obtained in the plaque assay for the same culture, which deviates from the general rule of thumb suggested by ATCC that PFU = 0.7x TCID 50 (ATCC, 2012). However, virus titrations are prone to biological variation, in addition to the inherent limitations of serial dilution methods and possible differences between operators in the assessment of CPE or plaque enumeration. Hence, replication of assays was carried out to ensure accuracy. The differences in the methodology for TCID 50 and plaque assays such as the agar overlay, staining to visualize plaques and the acceptable limits for countable plaques are other sources of variation between TCID 50 and plaque assays. Therefore, variation between TCID 50 and plaque assays may deviate from the rule of thumb for different viruses and culture systems. Similar to another study, comparing a fluorescent focus assay with the plaque assay for PEDV (Cruz and Shin, 2007) , the agreement between TCID 50 and plaque assays for PEDV in this study was excellent, with a correlation coefficient of 0.975.",

In these studies, the OD value to corresponding to the 50% end point was either applied directly (Andersson et al., 2005) or calculated as 50% of the OD of the negative control (Heldt et al., 2006) . Similar to Heldt et al. (2006) where half the mean value of the negative controls was used as the cutoff to distinguish positive and negative wells, in this study, the mean OD of the uninfected cell controls was 1.1 and the selected cut off value of 0.53 was approximately half the mean value of the uninfected cell controls. However, unlike Andersson et al. (2005) who used half the mean OD of the 50% end point as their cut-off value, using 0.35 or half of the average OD value of the 50% end point (0.7) in this study as the cut-off would have reduced the sensitivity and specificity of the assay significantly. To improve accuracy, and obtain a standardized OD cut off value with reliable sensitivity and specificity parameters, that could be applied across test batches in the same laboratory, we used ROC analysis as the tool of choice. The selected OD cut-off value to distinguish between wells with and without CPE, when applied to scoring wells and the calculation of MTT 50 values using the Spearman and Karber formula, produced excellent agreement between the conventical and MTT-based assays. While the agreement between the colorimetric and conventional tests was also high in the other two studies, detailed statistical analysis was not available in these publications to compare our approach of using ROC analysis versus directly applying an OD value to obtain the 50% end point.",

In addition, oxidative stress, glycolysis and factors which influence metabolism or energy also influence MTT reduction. Since MTT measures several cellular enzymatic activities simultaneously, its reduction can be significantly influenced by changes in experimental parameters (Stepanenko and Dmitrenko, 2015) . Further, comparison of the MTT and trypan blue assays for measuring adenovirus replication showed differences between the two assays at early time points (Tollefson et al., 1996; van den Hengel et al., 2011) , with reduction of MTT occurring even before the onset of cell death (Tollefson et al., 1996) . Hence, it is important to validate of the cut-off point with the specific culture conditions of each laboratory to avoid inter-laboratory variation and potential under/overestimation of cell viability.",

This study is the first to describe methods for a colorimetric V/N tests for PEDV which can significantly reduce the labor effort in performing this test. Conventional virus neutralization tests for PEDV are well established Cruz and Shin, 2007; Okda et al., 2015) and the primary goal of this study was to compare the conventional and colorimetric V/N's. Obtaining large numbers of quality samples from experimentally infected animals at the time this study was conducted was a challenge as PEDV was relatively new in the U.S. However, the design of this study meets the WHO guidelines stating that analytical validation is considered sufficient for incremental or adjunct tests (2017).",

However, the PEDV N protein ELISA is a reliable tool to distinguish between and select positive and negative samples for assay validation. In addition to the ELISA, samples were also screened by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Only samples with similar results on the ELISA and IFA were selected for testing in this study. As expected no cross-neutralization was detected in the non-specific control sera tested. Antigenic cross-reactivity, but not cross-neutralization, of PEDV and other related swine coronaviruses such as the transmissible gastro-enteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory and enteric coronavirus (PRCV) and porcine delta-coronavirus (PDCoV) has been previously demonstrated .",
