Results for the US for 1985-2006 indicate that airline performance is converging over time. In particular, airlines inter-temporal inefficiency peaked earlier and then converged. Furthermore, using Tobit specifications it is seen that while demand intensity matters less in determining airlines inter-temporal inefficiency, their influence is stronger in determining peer group inefficiency. Block time, a representative of operational factors, tends to negatively impact airlines efficiency by imposing burdens on airline operations. Among the structural cost and revenue factors, fuel cost tends to affect inter-temporal inefficiency more robustly than it does to peer group efficiency. Labor pay tends to reduce inefficiency in case of inter-temporal while increasing peer group inefficiency. The events of September 11th had little or no impact on intertemporal inefficiency but tended to reduce peer group inefficiency in a significant way. Finally, airlines efficiency tends to be robustly affected by block hours; reducing them increases efficiency.",

Unlike in economic slowdown of 1991/1992, this time the pressure was more intense and caused by domestic demand shocks from 9/11, wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), rapid low-cost carriers (LCC) expansion; Internet expansion in travel bookings; sustained lowfare environment; and unprecedented increase in jet fuel prices that took hold in late 2005.

The main commercial airlines (often termed as network or legacy carriers) that run predominantly hub-and-spoke networks remain in the business: American, United, Delta (now linked with Northwest), USAir (merged with America West), and Continental. Indeed, their market share shrunk as LCCs, largely Southwest, jetBlue, Air Tran, Frontier, and Spirit, expanded.

What used to be a nascent sector in late 1990s has grown into a powerful part of the industry constituting more than a third of the output. Furthermore, they wield considerable pricing power often led by Southwest Airlines. Despite all these challenges, commercial airlines in the US have so survived perhaps one of the most relentless pressures from the market environment and external events. The challenges continue as the industry faces higher fuel prices and a slowing economy in the latter part of 2008. Lost in this discussion, however, is the adjustment that the US airlines, particularly the legacy carriers, have made in the last few years. Capacity was adjusted downward more than 20% as they have retrenched into their hubs, incorporated considerable schedule flexibility, cut back employment and benefits, reduced services and outsourced routes to regional carriers, overhauled their maintenance and repair stations, rationalized their fleet and expanded international operations where the revenue environment is relatively more favorable than the domestic markets. Due to this, combined with increased load factors and some slowly emerging pricing power demonstrated seen in increased fare and fees, the US airlines industry posted profit in 2007. Faced with increasing fuel prices and an economic downturn, however, it is widely believed that the industry will lose a large amount of money in 2008.",

            "text": "In an analysis of performance of 45 US airlines, Vasigh and Flemming (2005) used the TFP approach using data from 1996 to 2001. They found national airlines with $100 million to $1 billion in annual revenue in the US domestic market have higher TFP than major commercial carriers (carriers over $1 billion in annual revenue). Authors found the estimated productivity differential was rooted in the hub-and-spoke configurations that commercial air carriers operate in the US. TFPs are estimated by fitting parametric methods, e.g. Cobb-Douglas and translog production functions. In comparison, the DEA approach employs relatively fewer assumptions and calculates individual DMU's position vis-\u00e0 -vis the production frontier. Fethi et al. (2000) studied the performance of 17 European airlines utilizing DEA technique over the period of 1991-1995. Results were then explored using a Tobit model in an effort to identify the effects of various explanatory variables on airlines inefficiency. Identifying inefficiencies and detecting their sources via Tobit model serves a variety of policy purposes, wherever applicable. In particular, authors found detrimental effects of market concentration and subsidy policies. By seeking to maximize benefits of economies of scope and densities, airlines often look favorably on alliances and mergers. However, authors found that such alliances impede competition, which leads to excessively high fares and eventual inefficiency. Adler and Golany (2001) used the DEA technique to study the configuration of hub-and-spoke (HS) legacy airlines in western European markets. Using the HS network as decision-making units (DMU), Adler and Golany used the DEA technique to evaluate efficient network configurations within the deregulated European airline environment. When there are excessive numbers of inputs and outputs, DEA measures are often not precise. The authors suggested using principal component analysis to cluster and aggregate inputs and outputs in order to avoid any imprecision in the DEA estimate of efficiencies. Gillen and Lall (1997a,b) used DEA to rank productivity of the 21 top US airports. They defined two separate classes of services, namely terminal services and airside movements and using data for 1989-1993 estimated the efficiency of both. In estimating the DEA airside efficiency, outputs were air carrier movements and commuter movement while size of airport area, number of runways, runway area, and the number of employees were considered as inputs. They used both these measures of efficiencies as dependent variables in a censored Tobit regression to identify the impact of structural and managerial factors affecting efficiencies. They found that terminals at hub airports operated at higher efficiency than the non-hubs. Furthermore, the gate utilization had greater impact on terminal efficiency. In particular, carriers with greater control of gates appear to have used them more of a barrier to entry than enhancing efficiency at hub airports. By identifying managerial factors associated with inefficiencies via Tobit regression, Gillen and Lall identified numerous ways to improve both airside and terminal side efficiencies.",

The output in this study was percent on-time gate arrivals while the inputs were scheduled arrivals, arrival demand, airport arrival rates, number of ground stops, and number of arrivals with enhanced departure clearance time. In addition to these inputs that author identify as controllable, the percentages of schedule operations under two different weather conditions, moderate and severe, were considered as noncontrollable inputs. Using data for 2000-2005, it was found that the airport inefficiency in 2005 returned to the level of 2000 for the airports under investigation. In order to explain the variations in DEA estimated inefficiencies, Diana too used Tobit models and found that arrivals with estimated departure clearance time appeared to have the largest impact in 2000 on inefficiency but its effects reversed in 2004 and 2005. Bad weather impacted only in 2003 while scheduled arrivals tended to reduce inefficiency in later years. Overall, the model's regressions fit were relatively poor for the later years than their first year (2000). Furthermore, unlike Gillen and Lall, roles of exogenous factors are, in most cases, difficult to gauge. Controllable factors explaining airport inefficiencies truly fall outside the purview of airport's on-time performance. Hence, policy and managerial implications of this analysis are not so clear.",

Interestingly, aircraft fleet expansion by the legacy carriers was accompanied by a decline in the number of FTEs while aircraft fleet expansion at the LCCs was accompanied with the increase in employment. This provides the first sign that one side of the sector, namely legacy carriers, was undergoing structurally different changes enhancing productivity than the LCCs. These changes are even more pronounced when changes in the wage and benefits are taken into account.

            "text": "Faced with industry, market and regulatory rigidities creating obstacles for industry consolidation, US airlines have had very little choice but to enhance productivities at every level of resource use. Many of these restructuring steps have been tremendously effective in enhancing efficiency. In production economics literature (see Varian (1999) for a basic discussion), efficiencies have been examined in two ways: technical and allocative. A firm is said to be allocatively efficient when the price it receives in the market place is equal to marginal costs associated with producing the extra unit of service. Technical efficiencies, on the other hand, evaluate a firm's ability to produce maximum level/s of output (either single or multiple output) given the levels of input(s). The outputoriented approach to technical efficiency, first developed by Charnes et al. (1978) (CCR) and later modified by Banker et al. (1984) (BCC), captures the underlying production technology and productivity implications under constant returns to scale (CCR) and variable returns to scale (BCC). Alternatively, a firm can minimize the use of resources in order to produce a given level of output (i.e. input-oriented approach). Compared to the output-oriented method, input-oriented technical efficiency too captures both constant and variable returns to scale. While technical efficiencies relate primarily to the physical relationship underlying the production of goods and services, allocative efficiency refers to firm's allocation decisions faced with market prices for inputs and outputs. Thus, physical inputs and outputs are considered key to understanding technical efficiencies, while input prices and output prices are key to understanding allocative efficiency. Here the focus is on technical efficiency. In panel A of Fig. 3 , a basic output-oriented CCR model is presented for one-output and one-input case as an example. The input-output relationship of a firm or so called decision-making unit (DMU) in DEA is given. Thus, DMU 1 is observed to produce at point A by using a given amount of input (horizontal axis) to produce a certain amount of output (corresponding point in vertical axis). Other DMU's input-output relationships are given by points B, C, D, and E.",

In order to uncover the production function, let us draw a series of straight lines tangent to the observed relationships of DMUs. Straight lines touching the observed relationships at B and E represent the inputoutput relationships of DMU 2 and DMU 5 , respectively. Notice that they are also observed upper bounds of the production technology representing the DMUs' input-output relationships. This is because a line tangent to B when shifted downward parallel to point A reduces output, but does not reduce correspondingly, the level of input. Thus, DMU 1 must be technically inefficient in comparison to DMU 2 . The same is true for point E. By drawing such lines and finding where the maximum output level is produced (frontier) and producible (observed), the technical efficiency frontier of the DMUs is drawn. A ratio of producible level of output over produced level of output provides a measure or index of technical inefficiency. For measuring relative efficiencies of a homogeneous set of DMUs for multi-input/multi-output frontier, the efficiency index can be constructed by taking the ratio of weighted sum of outputs over weighted sum of inputs. By construction, the lower bound of the index is restricted to be 1, representing technical efficiency while index value greater than unity indicates technical inefficiency. This measure of technical inefficiency is used for the empirical analysis. Contrary to output-orientation of Panel A of the Fig. 3 , Panel B provides the input-oriented technical efficiency frontier for the DMUs.",

            "text": "For the discussion in this paper, I consider one output and six inputs. Available seat miles (ASM) is used as output of the airlines. Inventory adjustment of seats provides airlines active control to wither a difficult environment. Airlines adjust ASM quite frequently as had been the case soon after 9/11 and continue to do so at present. Unlike other aspects of the business (e.g. revenue passenger miles (RPM) or load factor (LF)), airlines have a greater decision-making authority over ASM and thus it serves as a good choice for output. Inputs are gallons of jet fuel, number of full time employees (FTEs); ratio of flight stage miles to trip stage miles; utilization of aircraft (in hours); number of seats per aircraft; and number of aircraft. Annual data for 1985-2006 is used. Data come from Airline Monitor's processing of Form 41 and T100 database that is publicly available at the US Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Vasigh and Flemming (2005) used RPM in addition to ASM as outputs, although airlines typically have very little control over the demand side of the market as usually represented by RPM. The RPM, i.e. those paying for a seat mile, results from a mixture of demand and price. Airlines produce and supply ASMs given an anticipated price and a host of other factors. Important in all are the FTEs and jet fuel. Together, they accounted for almost 60% of the airlines' operating expenses in 2008. Often, these inputs are considered to be variable costs of production and important factors in determining airlines performance. The ratio of flight stage to trip lengths is considered to be representing airlines' underlying preference for network configuration. For example, a passenger traveling from city A to city C non-stop has the same flight stage and trip length. However, if this itinerary requires a stop-over at city B, then, the flight stage miles increases without necessarily reducing the trip length between A and C. With a considerable reliance on hub-and-spoke network (Bhadra and Texter, 2004) , especially by the legacy carriers, it is expected that trip length and flight stage would diverge. The opposite would be true if the representative airline preferred spoke-to-spoke network, as appears to be the case for some of the LCCs. Since so much of the airlines business appears to ride on network configuration, consideration of this input as a measure of network configuration in the production of output, ASM, seems appropriate.",

Rationalized fleet structure is represented by a measure of seats per aircraft; more homogeneous the number of seats per aircraft, the more rational fleet structure airlines are presumed to have (e.g. B737 for Southwest; or A320 for jetBlue). Larger aircraft may produce higher ASMs but at the cost of higher turn-around time. Furthermore, a heterogeneous fleet structure (i.e. variable number of seats per aircraft) may also impose burdens on productive efficiency that cannot be clearly understood without comparing performance of one airline (i.e. those using homogeneous fleet structure) to another (i.e. those using heterogeneous fleet structure). Utilizing aircraft efficiently is a variable input while seats per aircraft and number of aircraft are essentially fixed capital investments. In determining both the levels and efficiency behind given levels of ASM, these variables also play crucial roles.",

Southwest's inter-temporal performance deteriorated between 1995-2000 and again in 2003. In the beginning of the period and shortly after 2003, Southwest's inter-temporal performance approached unity. It is also evident that almost all legacy carriers have done relatively poorly when compared against its inter-temporal performance earlier.

As intensity of demand rises -with increasing LF and RPM accompanied with falling yield -it is expected that the pressure on airlines performing well may also rise.

Finally, airlines made significant adjustments in their network following the events of 9/11. To capture this, a dummy variable is deployed that takes a value of unity on, and after, 2001 and zero before. Constructing these variables (i.e. structural demand intensity, operational factors, and structural cost and revenue performance factors) allows consideration of the proportion of the variation in observed efficiency that can be explained by the structural variables (i.e. model fit), and their affecting the proportion of efficiency.",

When this is regressed over the sets of exogenous variables discussed above, a positive coefficient would imply increasing inefficiency and vice versa. Following this, it is evident that inter-temporal inefficiency of airlines is not statistically dependent upon the structural demand intensity factors, such as LF, RPMs, and yield.

These two latter variables are statistically significant. Increased block time, while holding demand variables constant, increases airlines inefficiencies due to its imposition of time cost (i.e. padded or actual time) to serve the same demand. This finding hastens the need for improved technology and other reforms in the National Airspace System (NAS) that may help to reduce the block time between two travel points. Strong negative relationship between block time and efficiency also highlights the fact that carriers may find significant cost savings from actions that may indirectly reduce block time. Faced with typical trade-offs between hub connectivity (enhancing revenue) and productivity (cost enhancing), legacy carriers often try to maximize connectivity by accepting cost penalties for schedule constraints. Barring new technology and procedural improvement throughout the NAS (i.e. global solution), a certain reduction in connectivity at local airports (i.e. local solution) via de-peaking, for example, may result in substantial cost savings (e.g. release of aircraft, schedule integrity and punctuality) through reduction in congestion and thus average block time, as had been the case with American Airlines at Chicago's O'Hare and Dallas-Fort Worth (Franke, 2003) . Utilizing aircraft longer hours, on the other hand, reduces inefficiency. Faster turnaround and longer utilization hours for aircraft help airlines operate more efficiently and the result confirms this.",

Increasingly, airlines operate under a high cost environment, especially after tripling of fuel cost in less than 3 years. Faced with this, airlines found ways to combine resources to deliver the same or higher levels of output. Consequently, their efficiencies improved over time.

Peer group inefficiencies report results for airline performance in comparison to those in their peer group for each year. Unlike the earlier results, structural demand intensity factors, namely LF and RPMs, affect airlines peer group inefficiencies in statistically significant ways. While increasing LF tends to increase inefficiency, increasing RPMs tend to reduce it. Increased LF leaves very little flexibility for airlines to achieve their productive efficiencies: the more seats filled on an aircraft (i.e. very little excess capacity), the less efficient its operations are, controlling for all other factors. Lack of flexibility that accompanies higher LF perhaps leads to increased inefficiency. Increased RPMs, on the other hand, tend to reduce inefficiency in a statistically significant way when evaluating peer group efficiency.

Furthermore, while pay per FTEs tends to increase inter-temporal efficiency, it tends to reduce peer group efficiency. That is, higher pay may improve an airline's own efficiency over time (i.e. improving labor morale and generally improving working conditions), however, it tends to increase inefficiency when comparing within the peer group. In other words, while pay and benefit may matter to establish an operationally efficient airline over time, it is no match against peer group competition.

Airlines' inter-temporal inefficiency peaked earlier over the period and converged during later years. Southwest performed somewhat less efficiently during two periods when compared against its own overall performance. Furthermore, the peer group results indicate that airlines inefficiency peaked during mid-1990s and were concentrated amongst a handful of airlines. All LCCs have been found to perform efficiently while compared within their own peers. Use of Tobit model to explain variations in airlines inefficiencies show that while demand intensity matters less in determining airlines' inter-temporal efficiency, it matters more in determining peer group inefficiency. In particular, load factors tend to increase inefficiency while revenue passenger miles tend to reduce it. Among the operational factors, only block hours affect inefficiency; the longer the block hours, the less efficient airlines operations are. Among the structural cost and revenue factors, fuel cost tends to affect inter-temporal inefficiency more robustly than it does to peer group efficiency. Pay for labor, on the other hand, tends to reduce inefficiency in case of inter-temporal while increasing peer group inefficiency. Finally, the events of 9/11 have had little or no impact on inter-temporal inefficiency but tend to reduce peer group inefficiency in a significant way.",

From the radical changes that took place over the last few years a single and relatively more efficient industry appears to be emerging. In an industry in which firms have similar performances, the possibility of them merging remains fairly high. The present merger scenario, led by Delta-Northwest, may be a prelude to this and perhaps what is to come. Second, it may not be useful to distinguish airlines, under these circumstances, by their operational characteristics (e.g. network versus LCCs). Third, airlines efficiency tends to be robustly affected by block hours; reducing them increases efficiency. In the short run, airlines can undertake schedule adjustments reducing block time and thus improving technical efficiency. In the long run, however, sustained reduction in block time would require fundamental changes in the route structures and underlying procedures leading to NAS-wide investments (e.g. NextGen technologies). Fourth, employees pay and benefit matter more in determining the long-term performance of the individual airline but less so when facing peer group competition. Therefore, labor policy will have to be harmonized if a unified industry structure is envisioned in the future. Finally, managerial control over LF and RPM should lessen. These controls have very little impact on the technical efficiency of airlines. Technical efficiency, in turn, determines long-term profitability. ",

Gains in employment at American Airlines, Alaska, and Continental were not been large enough to offset the losses incurred by other legacy carriers, namely, Delta, Northwest, United and USAir. The sharpest declines were observed at the USAir followed by the United. During the same period, LCCs registered a 127% employment gain [Panel B], moving from an average of a little over 28,000 full time employees (FTEs) during 1985/2001 (dark bars), the LCC employment increased to more than 64,000 during 2002/2006 (gray bars).
