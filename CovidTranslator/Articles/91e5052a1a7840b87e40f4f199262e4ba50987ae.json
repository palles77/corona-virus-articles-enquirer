            "text": "Protein phosphorylation plays an important role during the life cycle of many viruses. Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) capsid protein has recently been shown to be phosphorylated at four residues. Here those studies are extended to determine the kinase responsible for phosphorylation and the importance of capsid phosphorylation during the viral life cycle. Phosphorylation site prediction software suggests that Protein Kinase C (PKC) is responsible for phosphorylation of VEEV capsid. VEEV capsid co-immunoprecipitated with PKC\u03b4, but not other PKC isoforms and siRNA knockdown of PKC\u03b4 caused a decrease in viral replication. Furthermore, knockdown of PKC\u03b4 by siRNA decreased capsid phosphorylation. A virus with capsid phosphorylation sites mutated to alanine (VEEV CPD) displayed a lower genomic copy to pfu ratio than the parental virus; suggesting more efficient viral assembly and more infectious particles being released. RNA:capsid binding was significantly increased in the mutant virus, confirming these results. Finally, VEEV CPD is attenuated in a mouse model of infection, with mice showing increased survival and decreased clinical signs as compared to mice infected with the parental virus. Collectively our data support a model in which PKC\u03b4 mediated capsid phosphorylation regulates viral RNA binding and assembly, significantly impacting viral pathogenesis.",

            "text": "In order to determine if PKC associates with capsid, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Vero cells were infected with VEEV TC-83 (a live attenuated vaccine strain of VEEV) or mock infected. Following infection, cells were lysed and samples were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against VEEV capsid. Western blot analysis was performed on immunoprecipitated samples with antibodies against PKC isoforms \u03b1, \u03b4, \u03bc, and z. Analysis demonstrated an association between PKC\u03b4 and capsid but no other PKC isoforms tested ( Fig  1A) . PKC\u03b4 was also found to interact with STAT3, a known PKC\u03b4 interacting partner [26] (S1A Fig). A reverse co-immunoprecipitaion confirmed the interaction of PKC\u03b4 with capsid ( Fig 1B) , but PKC\u03b4 did not interact with the viral 6K/TF protein (S1A Fig). To determine at what point of the viral life cycle this interaction was most prevalent, cells were infected with VEEV TC-83 and collected at 4, 8, 16 , and 24 hours post infection (hpi). Samples were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against PKC\u03b4 and western blot analysis for VEEV capsid was performed. Results indicated the association between capsid and PKC\u03b4 is highest at 16 and 24 hpi ( Fig 1B) with a slight interaction observed at 8 hpi. The detection at later time points could, however, be due to increased levels of capsid at later time points making the interaction easier to detect. Furthermore, confocal microscopy was performed to visualize co-localization between VEEV capsid and PKC\u03b4. Cells were either mock infected or infected with VEEV TC-83 and incubated for 16 hours. Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with antibodies against PKC\u03b4 and either VEEV capsid (Fig 2A) or VEEV E2 (Fig 2B) . Consistent with immunoprecipitation results, a clear co-localization between VEEV capsid and PKC\u03b4 was detected. Co-localization analysis of z-stack images was performed and a scatter plot was created comparing the intensities of the red pixels (x-axis) with the green pixels (y-axis) (Fig 2C) . The scatter plot shows the intensities of every pixel within the image, the region within the yellow gate and indicated by the arrow corresponds to the regions of interest of which the Pearson's correlation was calculated (arrows in Fig 2A) . A Pearson's correlation at the regions of interest was 0.86 indicating a relatively strong correlation. Co-localization analysis of E2 and PKC\u03b4 ( Fig  2D) using the same gating as the capsid:PKC\u03b4 analysis did not show a strong correlation of colocalization with a Pearson's correlation of 0.31. Interestingly, localization of PKC\u03b4 in uninfected cells was fairly compact and perinuclear, suggesting localization in the ER/Golgi. However, after VEEV infection PKC\u03b4 localization displayed a more diffuse phenotype. Collectively, these results suggest that VEEV capsid interacts with PKC\u03b4.",

Similar results were observed with virulent BSL-3 VEEV TrD, with~1 log reduction of viral replication at 16 hpi. However, loss of PKC had no impact on eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) or western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV) (Fig 4B) . An alignment of the primary amino acid sequences for the capsid proteins of VEEV, EEEV, and WEEV showed that while both serine 124 and threonine 127 are conserved amongst all three viruses only serine 124 is predicted to be phosphorylated in all three viruses.

Sixty percent of mice infected with VEEV TC-83 succumbed to infection by 15 days post-infection while 90% of mice infected with VEEV CPD survived the infection (Fig 8A) . Furthermore, survivors infected with VEEV CPD showed less severe clinical signs of infection compared to TC-83 infected mice (Fig 8B) . Mice infected with TC-83 displayed mild signs of clinical illness (decreased activity, weight loss) by day 3 post-infection and increased in severity (scruffy, hunched, lethargic, significant weight loss) by day 5/6 post-infection. Surviving TC-83 mice recovered by day 11 (Fig 8A) . Meanwhile, mice infected with CPD mutant virus displayed mild signs of clinical illness (decreased activity, weight loss) with only 3 of the mice increasing to more severe signs and one mouse succumbing to infection (Fig 8B and S4 Fig) . These data suggest that VEEV CPD is attenuated in mice, warranting further study into its potential for a vaccine strategy. However, future studies identifying viral load and distribution of mice infected with VEEV CPD are required.",

PKC has been implicated in several different viral life cycles. Inhibition of PKC\u03b1 causes an increase in dengue virus replication, potentially by acting as a restricting mechanism that regulates dengue virus replication [33] .

A significant decrease of viral titers was observed starting at 8 hpi and continuing for at least 16 hpi after PKC\u03b4 knockdown by siRNA. To more specifically assess the importance of VEEV capsid phosphorylation, a VEEV capsid phosphodeficient mutant on a TC-83 backbone was constructed. Interestingly, the phospho-deficient mutant virus, VEEV CPD, displayed no significant difference in titer when compared to the parental TC-83. These data are contrary to the siRNA data which show a decrease in viral titer after knockdown of PKC\u03b4. These data could indicate that PKC\u03b4 is important in more than one aspect of the viral life cycle and that knockdown of PKC\u03b4 prevents another unknown mechanism of viral replication from functioning properly. It is also possible the phosphorylation of individual residues plays independent roles and PKC\u03b4 is only impacting one or some of the phosphorylated residues. Future studies with viruses containing single mutations and/or double and triple mutant combinations will be necessary to determine the importance of individual phosphorylation sites.",

            "text": "Our results show that knockdown of PKC\u03b4 and mutation of capsid phosphorylated residues decreases the level of phosphorylation on VEEV capsid to almost undetectable levels. We identified the phosphatase responsible for capsid dephosphorylation, PP1\u03b1, in our previous study [24] , but no kinase had been identified up to that point. The knockdown of PKC\u03b4 coupled with the drop in capsid phosphorylation strongly suggests that PKC\u03b4 is the kinase responsible for phosphorylating capsid. Our previous data suggest that higher levels of capsid phosphorylation results in less viral RNA binding and it has been shown in the related Togavirus, Rubella virus, that phosphorylation of capsid protein regulates its RNA binding and viral replication [41] . We compared the amount of RNA bound to capsid in either VEEV TC-83 or VEEV CPD and our results indicated that there is more viral RNA bound to capsid in the mutant strain. Coupling these data with our previous study that shows that higher levels of phosphorylation causes less viral RNA bound to capsid, we propose that capsid phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a cycle that regulates RNA binding (Fig 9) . Interestingly, VEEV CPD also displayed a lower genomic copy to PFU ratio and decreased pathogenicity. As VEEV CPD replicated to similar levels as parental VEEV TC83 in vitro, these data suggest that capsid phosphorylation is not necessary for viral replication, but rather regulates viral pathogenesis. The altered pathogenesis may be linked to VEEV CPD producing less non-infectious particles. Multiple viruses have been shown to produce non-infectious particles, including influenza virus [42, 43] , hepatitis B virus [44] , herpes simplex virus [45] , and yellow fever virus [46] . The non-infectious particles can be immature viruses, defective interfering particles, or semi-infectious particles with varying roles in pathogenesis ranging from increasing disease, stimulating the innate immune response, serving as a decoy for antibodies, or facilitating recombination [47] [48] [49] . Our data support a model whereby capsid phosphorylation facilitates the release of non-infectious particles which aid in disease development. Future studies will be aimed at determining how capsid phosphorylation regulates pathogenesis.",

Our data add to the list of viruses attenuated by ablating an important phosphorylation event. It shows that mutating the phosphorylation sites on VEEV capsid attenuates the virus in vivo.

After crosslinking whole cell lysates were generated via the addition of RIPA buffer (50mM Tris [pH 7.6], 150mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). The whole cell lysate was solubilized via repeated passage through a 30-gauge needle, and insoluble materials were removed from the lysate via centrifugation at 16,000xg for 5 minutes at 4\u02daC. The clarified lysates (~500\u03bcl per reaction) were then incubated with 50\u03bcl packed volume of Protein G Sepharose beads (Pierce) for 15 minutes at 4\u02daC. The resin was removed by gentle centrifugation at 5,000xg for 5 minutes, and the pre-blocked lysates were transferred to fresh microfuge tubes containing polyclonal anti-Capsid or nonspecific IgG. After 2 hours of incubation at 4\u02daC on a rotating mixer, 100\u03bcl of Protein G Sepharose was added to each tube and the incubation proceeded as before for another 2 hours. After the formation of the immunoprecipitation complex, RNAse A was added to each tube and the immunoprecipitations were incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature to fragment the bound RNA:Protein complexes. Then the nuclease treated resin was collected via centrifugation at 5,000xg for 2 minutes and washed three with excess volumes of RIPA buffer. After the removal of the contaminating RNAse and RNA",

Appearance was scored as follows: 0-smooth coat, bright eyes; 1slightly scruffy and/or hunched at rest; 2-scruffy and/or hunched at rest; 3-very scruffy and/ or hunched at rest, mild eye crust; and 4-very scruffy and/or hunched at rest, closed inset eyes. Mobility was scored as follows: 0-active, exploring cage; 1-less active, walking; 2-slow movement; 3-no movement; and 4-unresponsive. Attitude was scored as follows: 0-alert, 1-mildly lethargic, 2-lethargic, and 3-unaware. Body condition was scored as follows: 0-normal or overweight; 1-underconditioned; and 2-emaciated.

Viral genome-coding cDNA was cloned under the control of the SP6 promoter. Mutations in the capsid-coding sequence of the VEEV TC-83 that prevents phosphorylation of the threonine and serine in positions 93, 108, 124 and 127 were introduced using standard DNA techniques. Briefly, in the plasmid that encodes VEEV TC-83 cDNA, the fragment of the capsid sequence between AflII and Bsu361 restriction sites was replaced by in vitro synthesized gBlock gene fragment (Integrated DNA Technologies). In the gBlock fragment, all the serine and threonine codons corresponding to the capsid amino acids in positions 93, 108, 124 and 127 were changed to alanine codons. Presence of the mutations in the phospho-deficient capsid mutant virus was confirmed by sequencing of several viral genomes collected from infected cells. All of the sequences and details of the cloning procedures can be obtained upon request. In vitro transcription was performed on the mutated TC-83 molecular clone using the MEGAscript SP6 Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher, AM1330). Resultant RNA was electroporated into BHK cells and virus was collected 24 hours post electroporation. Passage 0 virus titer was determined by plaque assay as described above and used to infect Vero cells to grow virus for passage 1 as described above.
