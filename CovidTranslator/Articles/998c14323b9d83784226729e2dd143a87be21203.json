The acute phase response is comprised of reactions localized at the site of infection, as well as the initiation of systemic responses, which include a rapid increase in the serum concentration of some proteins, known as acute phase proteins (APP). Using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, we detected two APP of approximately 22 and 37kDa molecular weight in sera obtained from cattle with bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Based on their presence in the sera of sick, but not normal animals, the molecular weights, N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, and the ability to bind hemoglobin, we identified these proteins as the Q and B subunits of haptoglobin. The haptoglobin molecule and the Q subunit were isolated from serum, purified, and used to produce monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. With these reagents, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed to measure the concentration of haptoglobin in bovine serum. Using an experimental model of BRD induced by a sequential challenge of calves with bovine herpesvirus type-l and Pasteurella haemolytica, we Abbreviations: SDS-PAGE = Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; APP = Acute phase protein; BRD = Bovine respiratory disease; BHV-1 = Bovine herpesvirus-1; ELISA = Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; HPLC = High pressure liquid chromatography; PBST = Phosphate buffered saline with 0.5% Tween 20 * Corresponding author.

Furthermore, the concentration of haptoglobin was associated significantly with other measures of the severity of disease.

However, the manifestations of infectious disease are the result of both the action of the infecting organism and the animal's response to that infection. Hence, the study of disease requires not only attention to the characteristics of the microorganism, but also to the means by which the host responds to its presence. Every animal responds to the presence of a foreign organism by invoking a number of physiological changes, including rapid inflammatory changes collectively known as the acute phase response. The acute phase response is characterized by localized changes such as the aggregation of platelets and clot formation, dilatation and leakage of blood vessels, accumulation of leukocytes, and activation of stromal cells to release biological response modifiers. The release of mediators by resident and infiltrating cells then results in the initiation of systemic responses, including fever, leukocytosis, activation of complement and clotting systems, alterations in the plasma concentration of trace minerals, and changes in liver metabolism, including the production of a set of proteins called acute phase proteins (APP) (Heinrich et al., 1990) . Therefore, we initiated a study to evaluate the acute phase response of cattle because it may provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms invoked in different diseases.",

Infection with Pasteurella haemolytica raised the levels of haptoglobin, a-l proteinase inhibitor, and seromucoid, but not that of ceruloplasmin (Conner et al., 19891 , whereas Salmonella dublin infections in calves and suppurative inflammation of the mammary gland in cows increased the levels of ceruloplasmin in serum (Piercy, 1979; Conner et al., 1986) .

The sequences of the 22 kDa and 37 kDa acute phase proteins were homologous with the first eight amino acids of the reported sequences of the OL and p chains of bovine haptoglobin, respectively (Morimatsu et al., 1991) . That the absolute sequence homology of the cx chain falls to 70% for the sequenced 23 amino acids may be attributed to differences arising from the method of gas-phase amino acid sequencing. This method is extremely sensitive and allows long sequences to be generated. However, comparisons are known to be subject to variation because of equipment or technical differences, which become more pronounced with each cycle of sequencing. Analysis of the chromatograms from the protein sequencer precluded the possibility that contaminating proteins produced the sequence differences. Comparison of both bovine a chain sequences with the reported sequence for human cx chain haptoglobin (Kurosky et al., 1980) indicated an absolute homology of over 50% over the full sequence available for the N terminal. When conservative amino acid substitutions are introduced, there is significant homology over the first eight amino acids. The homology between the bovine and human B chain sequences is more obvious, and together, these results suggest strongly that the 22 kDa and 37 kDa acute phase proteins are indeed the OL and B subunits of haptoglobin.",

Use of the monoclonal antibody ID1 as both capture and detection antibody resulted in less nonspecific binding compared to using rabbit antiserum as the detection antibody. That we were able to use the same antibody for both purposes is probably related to the fact that haptoglobin exists as multimeric complexes (Eckersall and Conner, 1990; Morimatsu et al., 1991) and thus presents epitopes in addition to the one bound to the capture antibody. The similarity of the slopes of concentration versus absorbance for purified haptoglobin and acute phase serum (Fig. 5) indicate that the purified haptoglobin is recognized in a similar fashion to haptoglobin in serum, and is thus a suitable standard for calculation of concentration.",

            "text": "Bovine serum haptoglobin concentration has been reported to be increased in a number of disease situations (Makimura and Suzuki, 1982; Conner et al., 1986; Conner et al., 1989; Skinner et al., 1991) . In these studies, haptoglobin concentration was determined based on its ability to bind hemoglobin (Makimura and Suzuki, 19821, a procedure which is rather cumbersome and precludes the assessment of large numbers of samples. Thus, to date, the correlation of elevated haptoglobin concentration with specific diseases is based on relatively few animals for each disease condition, or measurement of haptoglobin concentration at only one time point in the course of the disease. A radial immunodiffusion assay has been developed which simplifies haptoglobin analysis (Morimatsu et al., 1992) , but this assay is still not amenable to analysis of large numbers of samples. Monoclonal antibodies to haptoglobin have been reported recently, but they were not used to quantify haptoglobin in specific disease conditions (Sheffield et al., 1994) . By developing a sensitive and relatively simple ELISA, we were able to monitor the serum haptoglobin concentration of 49 animals sampled daily over the course of an experimental BRD infection. In previous reports, haptoglobin levels of greater than 1 mg ml-' were detected in infectious conditions such as mastitis, metritis, and P. haemolyrica infection (Makimura and Suzuki, 1982; Conner et al., 1986; Conner et al., 1989; Skinner et al., 1991) . With the ELISA, we measured a mean peak level of 1 .l mg ml-' of haptoglobin on Day 8 of the experiment, with two animals having concentrations of haptoglobin in excess of 4 mg ml-'. Similar to previous reports, haptoglobin levels were undetectable (less than 30 kg ml-' 1 in animals prior to challenge. This data provides us with valuable information regarding the induction of the acute phase response, and in particular the kinetics of haptoglobin production, in this example of virus-predisposed bacterial pneumonia. While an increase in the concentration of APP is a well recognized phenomenon during the response to infectious agents, the proteins associated with the acute phase response vary between different animal species. In addition, APP profiles differ within a species according to the infectious stimuli. In this model of virus-induced bacterial pneumonia, few animals responded to the viral challenge with increased haptoglobin levels. Over the first 4days after BHV-I exposure. only 10% of animals developed haptoglobin concentrations greater than 100 p_g ml-' . However, 24h after P. haemolyticu challenge, 43% of the animals had haptoglobin levels in excess of 100 kg ml-' , and by 3 days after challenge, this proportion reached 84%. Thus, haptoglobin induction appeared to be related to the onset of bacterial infection. The induction of this response was detectable by 24 h after bacterial challenge, but the proportion of animals responding and the mean haptoglobin concentration continued to rise for another 2-3days. From the information in Fig. 7 , it can be seen that the kinetics of fever and haptoglobin induction differ, providing a distinguishing feature between viral and bacterial disease.",
