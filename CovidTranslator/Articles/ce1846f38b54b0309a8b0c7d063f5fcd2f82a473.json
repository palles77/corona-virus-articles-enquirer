Currently, reverse transcription quantitative qPCR (RT-qPCR) is used as the gold standard for diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2. However, the positive rate of RT-qPCR assay of pharyngeal swab samples are reported to vary from 30~60%. More accurate and sensitive methods are urgently needed to support the quality assurance of the RT-qPCR or as an alternative diagnostic approach.",

The limit of detection (LoD) was 2 copies/reaction. For the 103 fever suspected patients, the sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection was significantly improved from 28.2% by RT-qPCR to 87.4% by RT-dPCR. For close contacts, the suspect rate was greatly decreased from 21% down to 1%. The overall sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of RT-dPCR were 90%, 100% and 93 %, respectively. In addition, quantification of the viral load for convalescents by RT-dPCR showed that a longer observation period was needed in the hospital for elderly patients.",

Quantification is performed by applying Poisson statistics to the proportion of the negative partitions to account for positive partitions that initially contained more than one target molecule. dPCR can offer greater precision than qPCR and is far simpler to use for copy number quantification due the binary nature in which the partitions are counted as positive or negative. Additionally, dPCR is more tolerant of PCR inhibition compared with qPCR due to partitioning and because it is an end-point PCR measurement and consequently less dependent on high PCR efficiency (10, 11) .",
