Celastrol is a quinone methide triterpene and the most abundant bioactive constituent isolated from the root extracts of T. wilfordii. Previous studies have shown that celastrol exhibits antiviral activity against HIV and SARS-CoV. To date, no investigations of the anti-DENV activity of celastrol have been reported. This work aimed to investigate the anti-DENV effect and possible mechanism of celastrol in vitro and in vivo. Methods: A four-serotype DENV infection system was performed to determine the anti-DENV effect of celastrol by detecting DENV RNA replication and protein synthesis. The precise anti-DENV replication mechanism of celastrol was clarified using specific RNA silencing and specific inhibitor. In addition, the therapeutic efficacy of celastrol was evaluated by monitoring survival rates and clinical scores in a DENVinfected Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) suckling mouse model. Results: Celastrol inhibited DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4 RNA replication with EC 50 values of 0.19 \u00b1 0.09, 0.12 \u00b1 0.11, 0.16 \u00b1 0.14, and 0.17 \u00b1 0.08 mM, respectively. This antiviral effect of celastrol was associated with celastrol-induced interferon-a (IFN-a) expression and was attenuated by a specific inhibitor of the JAKeSTAT signaling pathway downstream of IFN-a or specific shRNA. Furthermore, celastrol protected ICR suckling mice against life-threatening DENV infection. Conclusion: Celastrol represents a potential anti-DENV agent that induces IFN-a expression and stimulates a downstream antiviral response, making the therapy a promising drug or dietary supplement for the treatment of DENV-infected patients.",

            "text": "Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped virus belonging to the Flavivirus genus in the Flaviviridae family, and based on antigenic diversity, DENV can be divided into four different serotypes (Halsey et al., 2012) . The virus has an 11-kb RNA genome that is translated into a polyprotein and is subsequently cleaved by both host and virus NS2B/NS3 protease into at least 10 mature viral proteins (Lee et al., 2015a) . Three structural proteins (capsid, prM, and envelope) distinguish DENV serotypes and regulate DENV attachment and entry. Seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) are indispensable for DENV replication and are highly conserved across DENV serotypes (Dalrymple et al., 2015) . DENV is an arthropod-borne pathogen that is propagated by the mosquito Aedes aegypti (Salazar et al., 2007) . DENV infection causes a spectrum of symptoms ranging from acute self-limiting febrile illness to life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) (Jones et al., 2005; Ubol et al., 2008) . The geographic range of dengue is extensively increasing due to urbanization and global warming, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas (McMichael et al., 2006) . Approximately 400 million people in over 100 countries are exposed to the threat of DENV infection (Bhatt et al., 2013; Ubol et al., 2008) . Currently, the tetravalent dengue vaccine exhibits limited efficacy (Screaton et al., 2015) . Hence, the discovery of alternative strategies to decrease the burden of DENV infection is urgently needed.",

            "text": "Innate cellular immune responses, especially interferon alpha/ beta (IFN a/b)-mediated antiviral signaling, are the most important action against viral replication and pathogenesis (Jones et al., 2005; Morrison et al., 2013) . In general, virus infection induces the production and secretion of type I IFN, which interacts with cell surface IFN-a receptors (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) on virus-infected and nearby cells. IFN-a receptors receive stimulation from type I IFN, leading to the activation of Jak1 and Tyk2 kinases via tyrosine phosphorylation. Subsequently, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1/2) are phosphorylated, after which they form heterodimers. The STAT1/2 heterodimers translocate to the nucleus and bind to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs), leading to the upregulation of hundreds of cellular genes and the induction of antiviral responses (Morrison et al., 2013) . Conversely, knockout mice that lack IFN a/b receptors or exhibit deficiencies in type I IFN production are susceptible to DENV infection (Johnson and Roehrig, 1999; Shresta et al., 2004) . Clinically, low levels of type I IFN have been observed in patients with severe dengue-associated disease, revealing that the IFN system plays an important role in preventing DENV infection and pathogenesis (Jones et al., 2005; Ubol et al., 2008) . Several reports demonstrated that IFN-stimulated genes and proteins could inhibit DENV replication, such as IFN-induced transmembrane protein 2 and 3 (IFITM2 and IFITM3), doublestranded RNA-dependent protein kinase, and 2 0 , 5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase/RNase L (OAS) (Jiang et al., 2010; Simon-Loriere et al., 2015) ; thus, boosting the IFN-mediated antiviral response might represent a potent strategy against DENV infection. Tripterygium wilfordii (lei gong teng; Thunder of God Vine), a member of the Celastraceae family, is a medicinal plant used to treat a range of illnesses including inflammation, swelling, fever, sores, and pain, and it has been used in India, Japan, China, Korea, and other Asian countries for some time (Ju et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2015b; Youn et al., 2014) . Celastrol is a quinone methide triterpene and the most abundant bioactive constituent isolated from the root extracts of T. wilfordii (Ju et al., 2015) . Celastrol is a meal supplement that is comprehensively used in herbal medicine because of its diverse biological activities, such as antiinflammation, anti-cancer, hepatoprotection, and immunomodulation (Youn et al., 2014) . Moreover, celastrol exhibits antiviral activity against HIV and SARS-CoV via different mechanisms (Ryu et al., 2010; Youn et al., 2014) . To date, no investigations of the anti-DENV activity of celastrol have been reported. In this study, our data revealed that celastrol inhibits DENV replication by upregulating IFN-a production and activating JAKeSTAT signaling in hepatoma cells. Celastrol also provided a protective effect against life-threatening DENV-2 infection in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) suckling mice.",

Six-day-old ICR suckling mice weighing 3.5e4 g were randomly divided into three groups, and the survival rates, clinical scores, and body weights of DENV-injected mice treated with or without celastrol were measured daily for 6 days. Relative to the iDENV group, severe illness leading to death within 4e6 days dpi was noted in the DENV group. By contrast, celastrol at a concentration of 0.1 mg/kg protected 80% of the mice against lifethreatening DENV-2 infection compared with the non-celastroletreated mice (Fig. 3A) . After 6 days of observation, the animals in the DENV group exhibited severe asthenia, paralysis, and 60% body weight loss compared with the iDENV group ( Fig. 3B and C) . Conversely, the celastrol-treated group displayed slight asthenia, paralysis, and 15% body weight loss compared with the iDENV group at 6 dpi ( Fig. 3B and C) . These results revealed that celastrol exerted a protective effect against DENV-2einduced lethality and related illness.",

To determine whether celastrol could induce IFN-a expression via this effect, we measured IFN-a-2, IFN-a-5, and IFN-a-17 RNA expression and IFN-a protein secretion. The DENV-2 infected-Huh-7 cells were treated with celastrol at increased concentrations for 3 days. The qRT-PCR analysis was then performed to evaluate the IFN-a-2, IFNa-5, and IFN-a-17 gene expression. As shown in Fig. 4AeC , celastrol concentration-dependently induced IFN-a-2, IFN-a-5, and IFN-a-17 RNA expression compared with the findings in non-celastroltreated cells. The inductive effects of IFN-a-2, IFN-a-5, and IFN-a-17 RNA expression by celastrol were also observed in na\u00efve Huh- celastrol for 3 days. Luciferase activity was measured to determine ISRE promoter activity and presented as fold activation relative to celastrol-untreated cells (defined as 1). Celastrol induces RNA transcription of (B) OAS1, (C) OAS2, and (D) OAS3 in DENV-infected Huh-7 cells. Huh-7 cells were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with DENV-2 at an MOI of 0.1 for 2 h. The DENV-2-infected Huh-7 cells were treated with 0.05, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mM celastrol for 3 days. Total RNA was harvested for qRT-PCR with specific primers against OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3. The RNA levels of OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 were normalized against the cellular gapdh mRNA level and are presented as the percentage change relative to the celastrol-untreated control.

To further confirm whether celastrol stimulated JAKeSTAT pathways, we first treated DENV-infected Huh-7 cells with celastrol at 0.2 mM for different time periods, and STAT1/2 phosphorylation levels were analyzed by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 5A , Celastrol treatment increases the levels of STAT1/2 phosphorylation in a time dependent manner. To further confirm the role of STAT1/2 in celastrol anti-DENV activity, shRNA against STAT1/2 was employed to silence STAT1/2 expression. As shown in Fig. 5B , celastrol effectively reduced DENV protein replication (lanes 1 and 2) , and the STAT1-and STAT2specific shRNA (lanes 3 and 4) partially restored the anti-DENV effect of celastrol. Relative to the depletion of STAT1 or STAT2 alone, depletion of both STAT1 and STAT2 exerted a restorative effect on DENV protein replication (lane 5). To further clarify the contribution of celastrol-induced IFN-a expression to STAT1/2 phosphorylation, the STAT1/2 upstream kinases Jak1 and Tyk2 were inhibited using a Jak1-specific inhibitor and Tyk2-specific shRNA. As shown in Fig. 5C , the Jak1-specific inhibitor effectively attenuated the anti-DENV effect of celastrol compared with the findings in celastrol-treated and untreated cells (lanes 1e3), and Tyk2-specific shRNA exerted a restoration effect on DENV protein replication (lanes 1, 4, and 5).

Moreover, we found that the OAS gene family, which is downstream of STAT1 and STAT2, was stimulated by celastrol (Fig. 6) . Similar results were observed in DENV-infected ICR suckling mouse brain tissue (Fig. 7) . On the basis of the findings presented in this study, we propose a model to demonstrate the action of celastrol against DENV infection (Fig. 8) . Simon-Loriere et al. demonstrated that the OAS gene family exhibits high anti-DENV activity, and Fig. 7 . Celastrol induces antiviral IFN responses in DENV-infected ICR suckling mice in vivo. Six-day-old ICR suckling mice were inoculated with 2.5 \u00c2 10 5 pfu of DENV-2 by intracerebral injection and administered celastrol (0.1 mg/kg) at 1, 3, and 5 dpi. Then, 0.1 g of brain tissue was harvested by TRIzol for RNA collection. (A) IFN-a and (B) OAS family gene expression levels were measured by qRT-PCR with specific primers against IFN-a-2, IFN-a-5, OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3. The RNA levels of IFN-a-2, IFN-a-5, OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 were normalized against the cellular gapdh mRNA level and are presented as the fold change relative to the celastrol-untreated control (defined as 1). The iDENV group was subjected to 60 C heat-inactivated DENV for 30 min. The numbers of mice in each group ranged from 6 to 8. these data supported our findings (Simon-Loriere et al., 2015) . However, DENV infection results in the inhibition of antiviral IFN signaling, which is attributable to DENV NS2B/NS3 proteasemediated cleavage of human mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA) (Yu et al., 2012) , NS4A-mediated inhibition of TBK1/IRF3 phosphorylation (Dalrymple et al., 2015) , and NS5 replicase-mediated inhibition of STAT2 expression (Morrison et al., 2013) . The inhibitory effect of celastrol on DENV NS2B/NS3 protease, NS4A, or NS5 replicase might in part contribute to its anti-DENV activity. This hypothesis should be investigated in the future.",

            "text": "In the decades, numerous groups intend to develop directacting antivirals (DAAs) for treating DENV infection. However, the high replication rate of DENV and low fidelity of NS5 RNA polymerase may lead to DAA-resistant variants, representing a major challenge in anti-DENV DAA development (Lim et al., 2013) . In addition, the efficacy of DAAs against different serotypes of DENV may be different (Lim et al., 2013) . Therefore, enhancing host innate immunity exerts protective effects against DENV progression, such as IFN activation, representing a potential tactic to avoid drug resistance and the effects of genetic variability in the viral genome (Lim et al., 2013; Morrison et al., 2013) . Numerous studies illustrated that type I IFN is involved in the pathogenesis of DENV infection and the progression from undifferentiated febrile illness (DF) to life-threatening infection (DHF/DSS) (Jones et al., 2005; Ubol et al., 2008) . Viral loads and the circulating levels of DENV NS1 antigen are the most important differences between DF and DHF in patients (Chuang et al., 2016; Halstead, 2015b) . The high circulating levels of DENV NS1 antigen result in the enhancement of DENV infection via virus-antibody complexes. Furthermore, the intracellular innate responses against DENV are suppressed by interactions between virus-antibody complexes and Fc receptors (Chareonsirisuthigul et al., 2007; Huang et al., 2006) , resulting in increased DENV replication and progression to DHF and DSS (Halstead, 2015a) . Therefore, celastrol-induced IFN may function as a potential anti-DENV factor and exert cytoprotective effects against DENV-associated cell damage and the life-threatening symptoms associated with DHF and DSS. Further study is necessary to elucidate the effects of celastrol against the pathogenesis of DENV infection and progression to DHF and DSS.",
