This study aims to determine whether chronic stress is associated with poorer influenza-specific immune responses to influenza vaccines in Hong Kong Chinese elderly people. This is a prospective study with a 12-week follow-up. Subjects were recruited from government general out-patient clinics, non-government organizations, and public housing estates in Hong Kong. Participants include 55 caregivers of spouses with chronic conditions that impaired their activities of daily living and 61 age-and sex-matched noncaregivers. A single-dose trivalent influenza vaccine was given to all subjects by intramuscular ingestion. Blood samples were collected before vaccination, at 6 weeks, and at 12 weeks after vaccination. Influenza vaccine strain-specific antibody titers were measured by the hemagglutination inhibition method. Lymphocyte subsets were analyzed for ratios and absolute counts, and cytokine concentration were measured by flow cytometry. Validated scales were used to assess psychological (depressive symptoms, perceived stress, and caregiver strain), social (multidimensional social support scale), and lifestyle factors (physical exercise, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption) at baseline prior to vaccination. Demographic and socioeconomic variables were also collected. Albumin levels were measured as an indicator for nutritional status in subjects. Caregivers had statistically significant (p<0.05) lower cell-mediated immune responses to influenza vaccination at 12 weeks when compared with those of the controls. No differences in humoral immune response to vaccination were observed between caregivers and controls. Hong Kong Chinese elderly who experience chronic stress have a significantly lower cell-mediated immune response to influenza vaccination when compared with non-caregivers.",

This relationship between stress and immunity is particularly significant in the older population (Ginaldi et al. 2001 ) because of an age-related reduction in bodily immune functions. In respiratory infections, influenza viruses are among the most studied because of their significant impact on morbidity and mortality in the older population (Hoyert et al. 1999; Yap et al. 2004) .",

Studies in western countries on elderly caregivers with high levels of stress have found prolonged endocrine and immune dysregulation, including alterations in vaccine response (Gravenstein et al. 1994; Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 1996) . Older adults with poorer responses to vaccines also have higher rates of clinical illness including influenza virus infections (Gravenstein et al. 1994) . As influenza vaccine efficacy is much lower in the elderly when compared with young adults (Berstein et al. 1999) , chronic stress could further decrease the vaccine efficacy in this population which could be of public health significance. With emerging viral infections such as SARS and \"avian flu,\" and the aging of post-war baby boomers (in a Western context), research aimed at understanding the various influences on the health and immune functions of older adults is of considerable public health importance.",

Culture-or race-specific studies are important because stress experiences may differ among different cultures, and it has been shown that racial and cultural factors are important determinants of stress experience (Connell and Gibson 1997; Valentine et al. 1998) . For example, members of collectivistic cultures that exist in Asia are associated with less caregiver strain (Garnaccia and Parra 1996) and receive better social support from their family networks (Ell 1996; Ohaeri 1998; McCabe et al. 2003) . Besides possible cultural influences on the caregiving stress experience, variable seasonal patterns of influenza in the tropics and sub-tropics has led some to raise uncertainty on the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines in these regions (Hsu et al. 1996 ; Thorpe et al. 2006 ). Furthermore, a study conducted in Taiwan showed that there were ethnic differences in immune responses to the hepatitis B vaccine, suggesting that host factors pertaining to ethnic origin could be a factor in determining immune responses to vaccination (Govaert et al. 1994) .",

However, in a critical review of studies that investigated the relationship between psychological stress and immune responses to immunization, Cohen et al.

In particular, although evidence supports a relationship between psychological stress and secondary immune responses to immunization, the evidence is weak for the relationship between chronic stress and the primary immune response. Moreover, few studies have been conducted to assess the impact of chronic stress on both cell-and humoral-mediated immune responses to influenza vaccination.",

Previous studies indicated that older adults with chronic stress associated with caring for a spouse with dementia were less likely to mount an effective antibody response after vaccination when compared with non-caregiver older people (with responders defined as those who had a 4-fold increase of antibody levels to influenza virus) (Kiecolt- Glaser et al. 1996; Glaser et al. 1999; Vedhara et al. 1999) . However, in contrast to results from previous studies, we were unable to show these differences in the proportion of responders to influenza vaccination between elderly caregivers and elderly non-caregivers. This may be due to differences in the methodology used in our study when compared with these previous studies. We analyzed and presented our data separately for each of the three viruses and the outcomes were expressed as a 4-fold increase in antibodies after adjusting for baseline antibodies titers (prevaccine immunity). These adjustments for antibody titers at baseline were not mentioned in previous studies. As a result, our methodology or analysis may provide more accurate results when compared with those from previous studies (Cohen et al. 1983; Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 1996; Glaser et al. 1999) . Furthermore, we found that there was a trend towards a lower antibody response to influenza A (A/Wisconsin/67/2005(H3N2)-like virus) in those without pre-vaccine immunity. This shows that after we stratified people according to their pre-vaccine immunity status, we may need a larger sample size to detect a difference in the antibody responses to any one individual virus (Table 9 ).",

First, we have showed that there were significant differences in ex vivo production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by stimulation before vaccination in elderly caregivers when compared with elderly non-caregivers. In particular, we showed that those with more caregiver strain had higher levels of inflammatory cytokine IL-6 which is known to be an indicator of depression and poor health in older adults (Lutgendorf et al. 1999; Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 2007 ). We added further knowledge in this area by showing that in addition to IL-6, IL-10, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8, which are all cytokines involved in inflammatory responses, were also significantly elevated in elderly caregivers when compared with elderly non-caregivers. Results therefore indicated that elderly caregivers have a Table 6 Immunophenotyping and enumeration of lymphocytes subsets in both groups at baseline Although stress might alter the immune response through health practices such as exercise and nutrition (Kiecolt- Glaser and Glaser 1988) , our results indicated that the altered cell mediated immune response shown in caregivers persisted even after we adjusted for physical activity and albumin level. This suggests that the altered immune response resulting from chronic stress may be mediated through pathways other than health practice. Cohen et al. (2001) , in a critical review on psychological stress and immune response, suggested that stress related hormones could play an important role in altering the immune response with effects likely to be mediated by glucocorticoids and catecholamines Limitations One limitation of our study is that we only investigated the effects of naturally occurring stressful conditions with adjustment or matching for possible confounders without using randomized experimental design for ethical reasons. As a result, there is a possibility that other unmeasured factors or confounders such as sleep quality that were not adjusted for in our study could account for the results observed. Second, we may have been lacking in statistical analysis to detect a difference in the antibody response between caregivers and noncaregivers to influenza vaccination after we stratified the samples according to the pre-vaccine immunity status of subjects.",

Psychological, social, and demographic assessments were all performed prior to vaccine challenge and the immune parameters were measured at several time points before and after vaccination with the change in antibody titers, cytokine production and lymphocyte response used as the outcome measure. Moreover, in our analyses, the antibody responses to vaccination were also analyzed separately and our 12-week follow-up to record the immune response to vaccination was much longer than those reported from previous studies where reduction in immunity can be observed (Kiecolt-Glaser et al. 1996; Glaser et al. 1999; Vedhara et al. 1999) .",

Finally, we have included a number of potential predictors of immune response to influenza vaccination, including age, gender, socio-economic status, social support, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and nutritional status which help to clarify the causal relationship between chronic stress and immune response to influenza vaccination.",

Our study showed that even in caregivers who receive influenza vaccination, the effects may be attenuated through decreased lymphocytes and cytokine production. Thus, caregivers may suffer from a double disadvantage of both decreased access to vaccine and reduced effectiveness from the vaccine itself. We also showed that the decreased immune response to influenza vaccination associated with chronic stress is present in a Chinese population residing in a tropical region where influenza is a common and important cause of mortality and morbidity, especially in the elderly population. As a result, there is a need to study the unmet needs of this population, in particular, their psychological and social needs. Further research, using rigorous experimental designs, should be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of social or psychological interventions in increasing protection to both with and without disease vaccination against influenza and other infectious diseases in this population.
