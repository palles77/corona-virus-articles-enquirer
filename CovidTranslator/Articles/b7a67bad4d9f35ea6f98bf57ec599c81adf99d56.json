            "text": "The School of Public Health at the State University of New York, Downstate Medical Center has sponsored a 6-8 week global health elective for fourth year medical students since 1980. The purpose of this elective is to provide students with an opportunity to observe the health care and public health delivery systems in lowincome countries, provide medical service and have a cross-cultural experience. Over the course of the past 35 years, 388 students have participated in this global health elective in more than 41 low-income countries. The most popular sites include the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, India, Kenya and Thailand. Overall, interest in this elective has persisted throughout the course of time, sometimes temporarily increasing or decreasing with outside factors, such as the events of 11 September 2001 and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Asia. Recent annual applications for this elective have been as high as 44 out of a class of 200 students. Over the past 10 years, annual acceptance rates have varied, ranging from a low of 32 % in 2007-2008 to a high of 74 % in 2010-2011 and 2013-2014. Careful screening, including a written application, review of academic records and personal interviews has resulted in the selection of highly mature, adaptable and dedicated students who have performed well at overseas sites. Student rated satisfaction levels with this elective are almost universally high, with most rating it the best experience of their medical school years. Students undergo extensive preparation prior to their travel overseas, including a review of individual health and safety issues, travel and lodging, and the nature of the host country culture, health care system and assignment site. Downstate medical students are especially experienced in cross-cultural understanding because of the unusual diversity of the patient population in Brooklyn, and the diversity of local hospital staff and the medical school class. The Alumni Fund of the College of Medicine has steadfastly supported this elective with both a philosophical commitment and financial grants to help defray costs since the very early years. The Dr. Michael and Lona B. Kenn\u00e9y Endowment, the Joshua H. Weiner endowment, and the LSK Foundation have also provided financial support for this elective. Throughout the course of this elective, overseas preceptors have willingly given of their time and institutional resources to make these experiences available and meaningful for our students.",

This is a result of the changing definition of international and global health over the course of the past few decades. Early international health opportunities for medical students often involved study in Europe and later included the South Pacific and North Africa. International health during this period was often defined within the broad context of tropical medicine [2] . At that time, medical school curricula included courses in tropical medicine/international health. In 1945, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) reported that 96 % of US medical schools taught tropical medicine/international health. By 1954, the AAMC reported that only 7 % of US medical schools were offering courses in these areas [2] . Competitive forces in medical school curricula and the perception that international health as a subject was of little relevance, except for a small number of students, was thought to be responsible for the overall decline in international health education in US medical schools.",

Contributing factors included the inaccessibility of low-income country sites, financial barriers, few institutionalized linkages between US medical schools and overseas sites, and the absence of elective time in the medical school curriculum. Another limiting factor to medical students studying overseas included significant travel time requirements prior to the availability of jet transport in the late 1950s. However, with the increasing ease of travel and changes that addressed the aforementioned barriers, the number of students performing electives overseas steadily increased.",

The American Medical Student Association (AMSA) began publishing its International Health Opportunities Directory in 1984. This directory is now solely online and updated regularly. AMSA also published the first edition of A Student's Guide to International Health in 1986 [10] . Today there are networks of organizations that provide assistance to medical students so they can access and participate in global health experiences. In 2013, in an effort to address the ongoing demand for these experiences, the AAMC developed the Global Health Learning Opportunities (GHLO TM ) Collaborative which serves as a resource to medical students and faculty throughout the country [11] .

Some applicants manage to eliminate themselves even at this early stage by commenting that their interest in a particular area of the world is primarily driven by a sporting or leisure interest or their purpose is to provide surgical expertise at what they assume to be low technology medical facilities. The second stage involves a review of a student's academic record to date. Since third year students begin their clinical clerkships after completion of the second year, several months of clinical evaluations are available and the co-directors review these, as well as all transcripts. Students who have had academic or inter-personal difficulties in third year clerkships are generally not admitted to the elective. Such students are often required by the College of Medicine to remediate clerkships or spend their fourth year at the clinical campus. Both the nature of these issues and schedule problems do not make it possible for them to participate in this elective. Students with academic difficulties in the first 2 years are considered for the elective provided they have not had additional such problems in the third year.",

She and her then late husband, Dr. Michael Kenn\u00e9y, Professor of Pathology at Downstate, had spent several years in the then Belgian Congo [14] . Dr. Kenn\u00e9y was an internationally respected parasitopathologist [15, 16] . In 1998, Joshua H. Weiner of the Class of 1941 created a generous endowment in the Alumni Fund of the College of Medicine for the purpose of supporting students participating in this elective. Since 1998-1999, this gift has provided part of the financial support for student travel associated with this elective. Dr. Weiner was moved to make this gift after reading about the elective in the Alumni Association's Alumni Today publication. As a fourth year medical student in 1940, Dr. Weiner participated in an overseas elective in Puerto Rico, sailing from New York aboard the S.S. Coamo. At that time, Puerto Rico was a third world environment where malaria, schistosomiasis, filariasis, and intestinal parasites were endemic. The faculty at the University of Puerto Rico's School of Tropical Medicine not only provided laboratory and clinical experiences for Weiner and the other medical students in his group, but also had them work in the environments where parasitic diseases were transmitted. Other alumni of the College of Medicine have made contributions to the Alumni Fund for the purpose of supporting the elective.",

Those who participate in this elective are generally students who have a strong social commitment. During the 35 years since this elective was created, newer challenges have arisen. These include safety and security in a world made more dangerous by political instability, terrorism, HIV/AIDS, and emerging and re-emerging infections such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Ebola Virus disease, and drug resistant tuberculosis. These and other issues have required newer preparation initiatives on our part to assure that our students have a safe, healthy and rewarding overseas educational experience.",

This is all very strong testimony to the dedication and commitment of these young people. Many of them are from working-class families, and most carry heavy educational debts.

Drusin, MD, MPH of the Department of Public Health at Cornell University Medical College to assist in the administration of a fourth year elective entitled ''Health Care in Developing Countries.'' At that time, 6-10 Cornell medical students arranged for overseas placements or were placed through faculty members, notably by the late B.H. Kean, MD, who was then Clinical Professor of Public Health and Clinical Professor of Medicine (Tropical Medicine). Dr. Imperato assumed the chair of the Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health at the Downstate Medical Center in June, 1978. With the experience gained in the Cornell program, and his over 6 years in West Africa as an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Imperato initiated Downstate's elective, ''Health Care in Developing Countries,'' in 1980. At that time there was no formal elective at Downstate for sending students overseas. In 2001, a Master of Public Health (MPH) Program was established in the Department of Preventive Medicine and Community Health. Following the formation of the MPH Program, the SUNY Downstate School of Public Health was established in 2008, with Dr. Imperato as Dean. The Global Health elective continues to be administered by the School of Public Health and has been under the direction of Dr. Imperato since its inception in 1980. Dr. Bruno was appointed co-director in 2007.",
