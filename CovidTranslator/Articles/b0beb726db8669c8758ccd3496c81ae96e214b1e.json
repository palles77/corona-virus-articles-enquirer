We hypothesize that novel anti-HIV peptides may be designed by using artificial sequences containing multiple copies of HR motifs plus zero, one or two functional domains. Surprisingly, we found that the peptides containing only the non-natural HR sequences could significantly inhibit HIV-1 infection, while addition of PBD and/or LBD to the peptides resulted in significant improvement of anti-HIV-1 activity. These results suggest that these artificial HR sequences, which may serve as structural domains, could be used as templates for the design of novel antiviral peptides against HIV and other viruses with class I fusion proteins.",

First, each peptide contains 3-5 copies of an artificially designed HR motif, which is totally different from the current anti-HIV peptides T20 and C34 that share a natural gp41 CHR sequence consisting of three different HR motifs (i.e., YTSLIHS-LIEESQN-QQEKNEQ) [7, 16] . Second, the residues at the a and d positions in the helical wheel are hydrophobic amino acids, e.g., Leu (L) or Ile (I), which can form a hydrophobic face for interaction with the residues at the e and g positions in the helical wheels of the N-helices. Third, the residues at the b and c positions in the helical wheel are negatively charged residues, e.g., Glu (E) and those at the f and g positions are positively charged residues, such as Lys (K). These amino acid residues can form a hydrophilic face to interact with water for increasing peptide solubility ( Fig. 1B and C) . Furthermore, the acid residues at the b and c positions in the helical wheel can interact with those at the f and g positions (i and i + 4), respectively, to form salt-bridges, in order to increase the helical structure stability of the peptides [17] (Fig. 1D) . Five, the functional domains, PBD and LBD, are added, respectively, to the N-and C-termini of the HR sequence, mimicking the CHR-peptides C34 and T20, respectively [9, 18] .",

While modeling the helix bundles formed by the designed HR-peptides with N36 by the PyMOL program, we found that all the designed HR-peptides had a tendency to interact with the NHR-peptide to form 6-HB. As shown in Fig. 2 , four amino acid residues located at the d positions (magenta) in 5HRa (L3, L10, L17, and L24) may interact with the four amino acid residues at the g positions (yellow) in N36 (G572, L565, A558, and Q551), respectively. However, the binding and the complementarities between the residues of 5HRa and N36 are weaker than those of the residues between C34 and N36. When the LBD was introduced to 4HRa, it appeared from Fig. 2C that most of the critical interactions remained the same. However, addition of this hydrophobic part may have added hydrophobic interactions which are not evident from the currently available N36/C34 structure. On the contrary, the introduction of PBD in 4HRa made the most critical hydrophobic domain of C34 available to bind to the pocket region, probably in a similar fashion as C34. Addition of both PBD and LBD to the HR sequence (e.g., PBD-3HRa-LBD) may have more dramatic effect on the overall interactions of these of peptides with the N-trimer.",

            "text": "Discovery of anti-HIV-1 peptides has created new avenues for developing viral fusion inhibitors against other viruses with class I membrane fusion proteins. This results from the fact that all these proteins contain the unique NHR (or HR1) and CHR (or HR2) sequences and use similar mechanisms to mediate viral fusion and entry [19] . It has been reported that peptides derived from the CHR regions of class I membrane fusion proteins are also effective against corresponding viruses, such as simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) [20] , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [21] , Ebola virus [22] , Nipah and Hendra viruses [23] , and severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [24] . We thus questioned whether novel antiviral peptides could be designed by using a universal HR sequence consisting of multiple artificially designed leucine-zipper motifs as a template. To test this hypothesis, we first designed and synthesized three peptides, each of which contains five copies of a unique HR motif (5HRa, 5HRb, and 5HRc), and then assessed their potential anti-HIV-1 activity. Strikingly, all these peptides exhibited inhibitory activity on HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion and on HIV-1 replication, although the potency was moderate (Tables 1 and 2 ). Our previous studies have shown that both anti-HIV CHR-peptides, T20 and C34, contain a common 4-3 HR sequence. However, the peptide containing only this HR sequence (e.g., CHR-3) had weak anti-HIV-1 activity while addition of PBD or LPD to the N-or C-terminus of this HR sequence (e.g., C34 and T20, respectively) resulted in significant increase of HIV fusion inhibitory activity [9, 18] . Therefore, we postulated that addition of PBD and/or LBD to the peptides containing multiple copies of an HR motif (e.g., HRa) might also improve their anti-HIV-1 activity. Following this logic, we designed and synthesized three sets of peptides by adding PBD or LBD to the N-or C-terminus of the HR sequence and tested their anti-HIV-1 activity. Indeed, all these peptides containing an artificial HR sequence plus one functional domain (e.g., PBD-4HRa or 4HRa-LBD) displayed improved inhibitory activity on HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion and HIV-1 replication. Interestingly, addition of both PBD and LBD to the Nand C-termini of an HR sequence (e.g., PBD-3HRa-LBD) resulted in further improvement of the anti-HIV-1 activity. Although the functional domain is critical for anti-HIV-1 activity, the HR sequence in the structural domain is also an important determinant for the antiviral activity of the designed HR-peptides. For example, all the HR-peptides containing HRa motif are more potent than those containing HRb or HRc motif in inhibiting HIV-1 replication (Table 3) .",

            "text": "In conclusion, the results from this study suggest that the HR sequence in an anti-HIV peptide may serve as a structural domain that can support the shape and the size of the peptide responsible for its interaction with the viral gp41 NHR domain. Here, we have identified several artificial HR sequences consisting of multi-copies of 4-3 HR motifs that could be used as templates, in conjunction with addition of the unique functional domain(s) from the corresponding viruses, for designing novel antiviral peptides against HIV and other viruses with class I fusion proteins. The blue and red sequences in a C-helix are pocket-and lipidbinding domain, respectively. The M W and pI were analyzed using ProtParam at ExPASy Proteomics Server (http://www.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). (B) Association of the HRpeptides to N36 peptide to form 6-HB. The gp41 6-HB is formed by N36 and HR-peptides through the interaction between hydrophobic amino acid residues localized in the hydrophobic interfaces. The residues at the a position (orange) and d position (blue) in a N-helix can interact with the d position (blue) and a position (orange) of other N-helices, respectively, to form an internal N-trimer. The residues at the a and d positions (green) in an HR-peptide can interact the e and g positions (red) in the N-helices, respectively, to form 6-HB. (C) The hydrophobic and hydrophilic interfaces of the designed HR-peptides. The residues at the a and d positions (green) can form the hydrophobic face to interact with the hydrophobic face of N-helices, while those at the b, c, and f positions (yellow) can form a hydrophilic face to interact with the H 2 O molecules in solution. (D) Prediction of the ionic interaction between the basic and acidic amino acid residues in the designed HR-peptides 5HRa and PBD-3HRa-LBD. The acidic residues at the b and c positions (i) in an HR-peptide can interact with the basic residues in the f and g positions in the same peptide (i+ 4), respectively, to form intramolecular salt-bridges to stabilize the \u03b1-helical conformation. Molecular modeling analysis of the interaction between the NHR-peptide N36 and the CHRpeptide C34 (A), and the HR-peptides 5HRa (B), 4HRa-LBD (C), PBD-4HRa (D), and PBD-3HRa-LBD (E), respectively. An HR-peptide is expected to interact with two N36 molecules. However, for clarity, only one N36 peptide (blue) is shown. The 4-3 HR sequences in C34 and the designed HR-peptides are in light orange and green, respectively. The PBD and LBD are in orange and red, respectively. The amino acid residues at d position (magenta) in HR-peptides interact with those at e position (yellow) in one N36 molecule, while residues at the a position (white) in the HR-peptides would bind to those at the g position in another N36 helix, which is not shown. Inhibition of the HR-peptides on gp41 6-HB formation. (A) IC 50 values of the designed HRpeptides for inhibition of 6-HB formation. Formation of the 6-HB between N36 and C34 was determined by a sandwich ELISA. Each sample was tested in triplicate, and the data were presented in means \u00b1 SD (bars). (B) Correlation between the inhibitory activities of the designed HR-peptides on gp41 6-HB formation and HIV-1-mediated cell-cell fusion. ",
