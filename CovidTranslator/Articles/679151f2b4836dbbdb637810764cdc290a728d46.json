The two main array platforms are spotted two-colour arrays and one-colour in sffu-synthesized arrays. Microarrays are used for a wide range of apphcations including gene annotation, investigation of gene-gene interactions, elucidation of gene regulatory networks and gene-expression profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and other fungal orgaiusms. Academic researchers and both the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries have an enormous interest in developing microarrays both as diagnostic tools and for use in basic research into how pathogens, such as fungi, interact with their host. Microarray experiments generate vast quantities of raw gene expression data, therefore good experimental design and statistical analysis is required for the extraction of accurate and useful information regarding the expression of genes. In this review we firstly provide an overview of the arrival and development of microarray technology. We then focus on the issues surrounding experimental design and the processing of microarray images, followed by a discussion on methods for cleaning and normalizing raw gene expression data and a final discussion of the importance statistical analysis plays in identifying differentially expressed genes.",

            "text": "Since the late 1990's, following the successful sequencing of the Eschericia coli genome, there has been a rapid advancement in genome-scale sequencing of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic orgaiusms. At present the publicly accessible National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) Entrez Genome Project database contains 257 complete or in progress eukaryotic genome projects. Seventy of these projects are fungal, however many more projects are underway in both public and private laboratories that are not yet accessible. This rapid increase in genomic knowledge has largely driven the emerging discipline of functional genomics, fuelling the development of high-throughput technologies and computational methods for the rapid interpretation and extrapolation of information on a genome-wide scale. Functional genomics aims to functionally annotate every gene within the genome, their interactions with other genes and their involvement in gene regulatory networks, hence, allowing for the study of biological problems at levels of complexity that have never before been possible. Functional genomics and the need for genome-wide expression analysis has been a major driver in the development of DNA, protein and combinatorial chemistry array technologies. DNA microarrays, which are used for simultaneously measuring the level of mRNA gene products from a given biological sample are currently the most advanced of these technologies and will be the focus of this chapter. Although proteins are the ultimate products of genes, measuring mRNA expression levels is a good starting point for functional gene characterization and currently it is a considerably cheaper technology then measuring direct protein levels which utilizes mass spectrometry resources.",

This is achieved by monitoring the combinatorial interaction of a set of DNA or mRNA fragments with a predetermined library of polynucleotide probes. Before the emergence of this technology, using techniques such as Northern blots or quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), researchers were only able to measure expression at the mRNA level for a limited number of genes. With the advent of microarrays it is now possible for researchers to uniquely and quantitatively measure the expression of tens to hundreds of thousands of genes at any given time within a given biological sample on a single platform. There is enormous potential for expansion of our scientific knowledge and discovery through the application of microarrays into the investigation of gene-gene interactions and in pharmaceutical and clinical research to enable further understanding of disease and the creation of future diagnostic tools to individualize molecular medicine.",

Research from the fields of biology, statistics, mathematics, computer science and physics are drawn together to further our understanding of biological processes. Like all experiments the value of the data generated can be greatly affected by the choice of experimental design, and the implementation and analysis phases. With the ultimate goal being to make inferences among biological samples, their genes and associated levels of mRNA expression, many factors must be considered and integrated during each phase. Microarray data must be integrated with nucleotide sequence data, knowledge of protein structure and fimction, and with phenotypic and clinical data. The overall goal of this chapter is to provide the reader with an overview of current DNA microarray technologies and to introduce issues regarding the experimental design and analysis of microarray data.

Whether the microarrays, also known as gene expression arrays, DNA chips, biochips or chips, are commercially-or home-made, cDNA or oligonucleotide based, they all share a number of generic features in regards to their underlying technology such as the probe or 'spot', the target or sample probe and the soHd-phase mediimi of the array platform. The probe or 'spot' typically refers to the single stranded polynucleotide (DNA) that is fixed onto the array. Typically the polynucleotide is of known sequence but may come from a custom unsequenced cDNA library. The term 'target' or 'sample probe' is commonly used to refer to the polynucleotide in the given sample solution which hybridizes to the fixed complementary probe sequence (Kohane et al. 2003) . In general there are two basic sources for nucleotide probes on an array; each unique oligonucleotide probe is either individually synthesized base pair by base pair onto the solid array surface (Baldi and Hatfield 2002) or pre-synthesized DNA, cDNA, oligonucleotides or PCR products are directly attached to the array surface. If oligonucleotides are used the probes can be either short, 24-30 bases in length, or long, 60-70 bases in length, while the pre-synthesized PCR and cDNA products are typically hundreds to thousands of base pairs in length (Yauk et al. 2004 ). The DNA, PCR products or cDNA probes are generally amplified from a vector stored within a bacterial clone or are amplified from open-reading frames or nucleotide fragments of a chromosome (Kohane et al. 2003) . Traditionally pre-synthesized probes are attached to the solid array surface using techniques such as robotic spotting or piezoelectricity. Typically the target or sample probe is RNA or cDNA synthesized from the total RNA or mRNA extracted from the biological sample of interest, which for detection purposes is synthesized using fluorescently or biotinylated labeled nucleotides.",

Glass is a good choice of material for the solid phase and it is typically pre-coated with a product such as silicon hydride and poly-lysine or poly-amine to reduce background fluorescence and encourage electrostatic adsorption of the probes onto the slide (Baldi and Hatfield 2002; McLachlan et al. 2004) . The solid phase of the array contains a grid with an ordered arrangement of tens to hundreds of thousands of \"spots\" or \"wells\" that are each capable of holding a droplet of the probe molecule (Kehoe et al. 1999) . If a glass slide is used the spotted or in si^w-synthesized probe is typically inunobilized by air drying and ultraviolet (UV)-irradiation (Cheung et al. 1999) .

This allows for the determination of the relative levels of mRNA expression of target sequences within the sample via measurement of the quantity of labeled target that binds to each immobilized spot of DNA (Colebatch et al. 2002) . In a typical twocolour array experiment one sample (e.g. treatment sample) is labeled with a red Cy5 dye and the second sample (e.g. control sample) is labeled with a green Cy3 dye ( Figure 1 ). After co-hybridization and scaiming, the colour of the spot indicates the relative abundance of each sample. If a spot is significantly red it indicates that the gene in the treatment is in abundance, if it is green it indicates RNA from that gene in the control population is in abundance, if the spot is yellow it indicates equal levels of binding and hence no-change in gene expression, while a black spot indicates that binding has not occurred. With one-colour arrays, a single sample is hybridized to each chip, and the relative ratios of absolute spot intensities are compared to estabhsh relative abundances.",

For GeneChip'^^ arrays, each gene is typically represented by one probe set. Each probe set typically consists of 11 probe pairs which each cover a different 25 base pair section of the target mRNA (older chips used up to 20 probe pairs). Each probe pair consists of a complementary perfect match (PM) 25 mer oligonucleotide, and a mismatch (MM) 25mer oligonucleotide in which the 13*^ nucleotide in the sequence is changed to its complement, thereby functioning as a non-specific hybridization control (Brewster et al. 2004 ). However, the effectiveness of the MM oligonucleotide in this role is questionable as it has been shown that many MM's are also sensitive to the true target signal effectively invalidating such a role (Irizarry et al. 2003b) .

Before embarking on an experiment one must decide what biological questions one seeks to answer. On this basis one can chose a suitable probe library (this will define the chip type), and what samples or pairs of samples, will be hybridized against this probe library. One must also consider the feasibility of randomizing sample collection and date of hybridization to avoid confounding results. It is also important to consider how much replication is possible. Finally, thought should be given to how the data will be analysed. Typically many of these choices are driven by cost, but some forethought can help refine and prioritize the biological aims of the experiment thus maximizing the information gained from an experiment.",

            "text": "Microarray experimental design is largely concerned with choosing the hybridization strategy. However, before looking at this in detail we should first review the basic steps in a microarray experiment. A typical microarray experiment begins with the extraction of mRNA or total RNA from a specific biological sample of interest followed by synthesis of fluorescently labeled cDNA target ( Figure 1 ). It is important that during the extraction of RNA, all traces of genomic DNA are removed in order to keep background levels low as it is a common source of contamination. The isolated mRNA or total RNA is typically reverse transcribed by first-strand cDNA synthesis and labeled for detection during the scanning process. For two-coloured microarrays the most commonly used fluorescent probes are the cyanine dyes Cy3 (green) and Cy5 (red) whilst one-colour arrays typically use biotin/strepatavidin conjugated probes for labeling. The labeled target is then denatured by heating to obtain single stranded polynucleotides from the sample, which upon cooling will hybridize to its complementary probe fixed on the array. In order to promote the specific and complementary binding of the labeled sample to its probe while reducing the level of background noise, it is of critical importance that the hybridization conditions are optimized (Brewster et al. 2004) . Following hybridization, the array is washed to remove any unhybridized sample probes, and the amount of target hybridized to each spot is then quantified by scanning and image processing (see section 5). Microarray experiments thus include a large number of technical steps, and the resultant level of background noise can be influenced at many points and can depend upon the skills of the technicians performing extraction, labeling and hybridization. It is important to be aware of how the data is generated, so that it may be appropriately analysed, but we will not discuss this further instead concentrating on issues related to choosing what to hybridize.",

Two-colour spotted arrays are cheap, but typically more noisy than the one-or two-colour commercial arrays systems (Irizarry et al. 2005) . One also desires to perform sufficient biological replication to build confidence in the results. Using a cheaper system allows for the use of more replication or time points in a time course study, however the gain may not be huge due to increased noise of such systems. Sometimes the availability of a specific probe library will make a single platform the obvious choice, and similarly the desire for a specific comparison may make one design standout.",

Two-colour microarrays are analogous to matched pairs experiments -by co-hybridizing samples we control for many array and hybridization specific variables. To achieve similar power, one-colour arrays must be technically more stable and reproducible. With Affymetrix, the production methods and robotic control of hybridization ensures that this is generally the case (Irizarry et al. 2005) . In general two-colour competitive hybridization is good for small-scale experiments, but as the scale increases, one faces problems in choosing which pairs of samples to co-hybridize, shifting the balance towards one-colour systems. Also if hybridizations are to be conducted over long time scales then one-colour systems may be more appropriate than using a two-colour system with a common reference design (discussed later).",

Treatments and conditions relating to growth and isolation of the samples need to be identified, performed and kept tightly constant across all specimens in order to minimize biological variation arising from environment. Kazan et al. (2001) suggest that in order to gain the best possible comparisons, a separate control accounting for differences imposed by treatments must be used for each treatment in the experiment. Once the biological sample is selected and control and treatment groups obtained then the next stage in the process is generation of the sample which requires the isolation of either total RNA or mRNA. If RNA becomes degraded during the experimental process then it will be unsuitable for labeling by most standard techniques. Some manufacturers do offer alternative protocols when RNA degradation cannot be avoided. To help determine the integrity and quality of the sample the RNA is typically examined by \"denaturing\" gel electrophoresis. The presence of RNA degradation in Affymetrix arrays can also be detected in-silico using RNA degradation plots and NUSE boxplots which are part of the affy and affyPLM packages of the freely available Bioconductor analysis package (Gentleman et al. 2004 ).",

These models cover issues concerning the labeling and allocation of arrays and the order of sample probe hybridization to the arrays. The choice of experimental design is dictated by the biological questions being asked, availabiUty of microarray platforms, suitabiHty of analysis software and constraints related to amounts of RNA and financial considerations. At present the most commonly used models are the reference design, the balanced block design, the loop design, the dual-label or dyeswap design (only applicable to two-colour arrays) and the time course and factorial designs ( Figure 2 ). Each of these will be briefly discussed below.",

            "text": "The reference design ( Figure 2B ) involves a common reference being used for comparisons with treatment effects across a number of different experiments. To be useful, the reference must contain detectable levels of all genes expressed in samples co-hybridized with it, therefore the reference is often a pooled sample of all experimental conditions. This design often makes the assumption that the effect of dye bias is equal across all comparisons with the reference (Maindonald et al. 2003) as the reference is generally labeled with the same dye on each array. Therefore any gene-specific dye bias not removed by normalization will affect all arrays in a similar fashion (Simon and Dobbin 2003) . One reason for using this design is when there is hmited availability of RNA from one or all of the samples. The orientation of dye labeling is applied in the same direction so that samples for comparison are always labeled with the same dye and the reference is always labeled with the same dye (Churchill 2002) . For spotted arrays, this design uses an aliquot of common reference RNA as one of the samples co-hybridized to each array so that comparisons between the reference and sample of interest can occur on the same spot (Simon and Dobbin 2003) . In the opinion of Maindonald et al. (2003) a direct pair-wise comparison for two treatments should be more precise than indirect comparison of all treatments through a reference. Similarly, Churchill (2002) argues that use of a reference sample is tmnecessary and results in inefficient experiments as half of the gene-expression measurements are made on the reference sample which is generally of no interest to the researcher. Reference designs can still be appropriate in complex experiments where each sample is involved in several comparisons.",

In comparison to the reference design, the loop design is more balanced with respect to the dyes as each sample is labeled at least once with each of the dyes used (Kerr and Churchill 2001) . A major down-side to this design however is the increased variance due to the requirement for modeling indirect effects relating to the arrays that link two samples of interest (Simon and Dobbin 2003) . The loop design is also generally less robust in respect to the occurrence of bad arrays as one or more bad arrays result in breaking of the loop whereas in the reference and block designs they can simple be removed from subsequent data analysis.",

Image analysis and the resulting acquisition of data is an important aspect of microarray experiments and can potentially have a large impact on subsequent data analysis. The commercial platforms (e.g. Affymetrix and Agilent) tend to have their own customized image analysis software packages, which leave Httie choice to the end user. However, inhouse spotted arrays are typically more variable, requiring more care in the choice of image analysis software to ensure unnecessary variation is not introduced.

Addressing or gridding is the process of locating each spot on the slide and assigning it to a coordinate by taking advantage of the rigid layout of the spots. Segmentation is the method used to differentiate and classify the foreground pixels for each spot and background pixels.

Spots are classified as poor quality when they have variable diameters and contours, a background signal that is higher then the foreground signal or the presence of spatial artifacts (McLachlan et al. 2004) . A good image analysis program should therefore have the capability of collecting quahty measures for each spot that can be used to flag um-eliable spots or arrays.

The intensity is proportional to the number of sample probes hybridized to the spotted probe (Cheung et al. 1999) . Commonly used scanners are typically based on a confocal laser microscopy system where a separate laser is used as a source of excitation Ught for each fluorescent dye, and a photomultiplier (PMT) tube is used as the detector. In brief the fluorescent dyes become 'excited' by the laser light, absorbing its energy, and resulting in the emission of photons (Cy3 dyes produce a band from 510-550nm, whilst Cy5 dyes produce a band in the 630-660nm range). A detector such as the PMT is scanned across the surface and measures the intensity at each point (Baldi and Hatfield 2002; Yang et al. 2002a) . Depending on the scanner used a number of settings such as the power of the excitation laser and the voltage of the PMT can be varied to improve the sensitivity of image acquisition so that low signals can be detected.",

Histogram segmentation uses a thresholding system for classifying pixels as either foreground or background (Chen et al. 1997 ), but often results in the over-and under-estimation of foreground and background intensities (Smyth et al. 2003) . Adaptive shape segmentation methods such as the watershed (Beucher and Meyer 1993) and seeded region growing (Adams and Bischof 1994) implemented within the Spot software make no assumptions in regards to the spots circularity and size and hence are suitable for use with both commercial and non-commercially produced arrays.",

Backgroimd intensity needs to then be approximated using a suitable method and subtracted from the spot intensity to provide a foreground fluorescent intensity. For two-colour arrays foreground and background intensity needs to be calculated for both the Cy3 (green) and Cy5 (red) channels. Correction for background intensity is necessary as it is likely that not all of the measured spot intensity comes from the fluorescent label of the hybridized sample. Signals can also result from factors such as non-specific hybridization, from fabrication artifacts on the glass caused by chemicals, dust and spatial variation. If the method for background estimation is poorly chosen, correction of foreground can result in negative intensities and hence missing values when log intensities are computed, typically resulting in the loss of low-intensity data (Smyth et al. 2003) . Poor choice of background correctors can also introduce extra noise (variability) making detection of true differential expression more difficult (Yang et al. 2002a; Ritchie 2004 ).

Generally however, these methods can be classified on the basis of whether they use a constant or global value, a local background estimate or a morphological background estimated by applying a non linear filter to a local window around the spot (Yang et al. 2002a) . Local background methods only consider the intensities of small regions surrounding the spot mask while global background generally considers the intensity of background for the whole array. In the experience of Smyth et al. (2003) local background methods result in over estimation of the background while global methods can result in an under-estimation of the background. Morphological opening tends to give a less variable background estimate which is not upwardly biased by the presence of bright pixels (Yang et al. 2002a; Ritchie 2004) . Ritchie (2004) has performed an indepth study of different background estimators and advises that if the purpose of the experiment is to select differentially expressed genes then the use of a morphological opening background estimator is recommended. Morphological opening has been available in the Spot (http://www.cmis.csiro.au/index.htm) software package for several years, and more recently has been included in GenePix (http://www.axon.com) and ImaGene's (http://www..biodiscovery.com) offerings.

Within this process it is often common to calculate the false-discovery rate, in order to determine the number of expected false-positives and false-negatives that are to be included or excluded from the final list of differentially expressed genes.

A number of variations can also arise during both the labeling and hybridization stages. If the conditions of hybridization, such as temperature and duration, are not optimized and kept constant, further variations will arise during the stages of scanning and image processing and there will be a higher occurrence of non-specific hybridization of the samples to the probes. Non specific hybridization and the presence of foreign artifacts on the arrays such as dust, clothing fibers, skin and scratching of the slides is also a significant problem for both of the common array platforms. During the labeling process non-controllable sequence bias can occur, resulting from some of the fluorescent dye labels showing preferential binding to some nucleotides over others. Another variation specific to spotted arrays relates to the lengths of the probes. As the probe length can vary from a hundred to a thousand bases in length, there is a higher likelihood of the probes cross-linking which results in a decreased number of available probe molecules for the binding of sample probes. Also, the actual process of robotically spotting the probes onto the array can introduce a great deal of systematic variation due to inconsistencies occurring with location, size and shape of spots on the individual arrays and between the arrays. These variations typically result from there being slight differences between the print-tips on the robotic arrayer, or from using arrays that were generated at different times. One of the most common forms of bias affecting spotted microarrays is that of dye-bias also known as red-green bias. Dye-bias arises due to there being differences between the labeling efficiencies and scanning properties for the two fluorescent dyes, Cy3 and Cy5. For any array platform, there is often a major problem with saturation of the probes, occurring when the probe intensities reach the maximum level of intensity acquired by the scanner.",

While normalization is generally considered necessary, over normalizing the data can introduce biases that are more detrimental to the identification of differentially expressed genes than a small difference in scale.

This approach is used as the MM is supposed to measure non-specific signal binding to the PM (i.e.",

C) displays the plot after performing the recommended print-tip intensity dependent loess normalization. This normalization approach involves fitting individual loess lines tiu-ough each of die print tip groups on tiie array to bring the mean M in all print tip groups to zero. Li and Wong (2001) noted that variation between probes in a probe set was often substantially (5 times or more) than the variation in values for a given probe across arrays. This massive within probe set variance thus advocates treatment of probe specific effects when trying to summarize probesets and Li and Wong (2001) advocated a multipHcative model in their dChip software. Irizarry et al. (2003a,b) used a series of experiments spiking in RNA of known concentrations to study probe sets effects and further noticed that many MM's showed concentration dependent effects (that is they were often sensitive to true signal in addition to any non specific background signal) and concluded that a more appropriate approach was a additive model, which they used in their highly successful RMA approach. RMA performs a background correction and normalization step on individual probes, before obtaining a probeset summary. The probeset summary comes from an additive model where the observed intensity in a probe is modeled as the sum of the true probeset expression value, a probe affinity term, and an error term. RMA then uses the estimate probeset expression value as its measure. Before considering the RMA approach we will examine the normalization system used in MASS, which is based upon the summarized average difference values for each probe set.",

This method assumes the deviation from an M value of 0 varies in an intensity dependent way (i.e. over the range of A values observed. This is most obvious in MA plots where one observes curvature in the raw data ( Figure 3A ). At each value of A, a robust locally weighted regression line is obtained to robustly locate the central M value of the points. This value is then subtracted from all points at this value of A, thus shifting the central cluster of points back to the zero line ( Figure 3C ). Outliers (which in this case are differentially expressed genes) do not influence this calculation. Intensity-dependent Loess normalization may be applied globally over an array, or individually to each print tip group on an array. This latter case may be necessary due to slight variations within the print-tips, the robotic spotter tip length or opening may vary during the array assembly process leading to spatial variation across the sUde. Print tip intensity dependent loess also performs a de-facto spatial normalization as well, although this may occasionally perform poorly if there is strong intensity gradient within the print tip group (perhaps due to a local hybridization artifact). It is also possible to use spot quality weights in these methods, so poor quaUty spots do not influence the normalization procedure. In general it is recommended that print-tip intensity dependent loess is used as the default normalization method for two-colour microarrays.

After within-slide normalization, all normalized log-ratios will be centered around zero, regardless of the normalization method i.e. whether lowess or non-linear, however it is useful to examine boxplots displaying the spread of log-ratios for individual arrays to determine if scaling is required between arrays (Smyth et al. 2003) . Failing to perform scale-normalization could lead to one or more slides having undue weight when averaging log-ratios across experiments to an average of log-ratios across slides. One common method of scale normalization is to divide each intensity by the total of the intensities on the slide, so that all slides then have the same total intensity.

The Student's f-test, or simply f-test, is one of the simplest and most common methods that can be used to compare two conditions provided that true biological replication has been used in the experiment. In general, methods based on calculating the tstatistic are able to identify differentially expressed genes by examining the difference between the means, relative to the spread, or variance of the data by determining the ratio of the difference between two means and measuring the variability, or error variance, between the two data sets for each gene (Cui and Churchill, 2003) . The ordinary ^statistic however is still not ideal in the context of microarrays as it is sensitive to genes with unusually low variance, resulting in an excessive number of false-positives in the list of differentially expressed genes. Genes identified as having a small estimated sample, or error variance, may still have a good chance of giving a large f-statistic even when they are not differentially expressed (Smyth et al. 2003) . Smyth (2004) has developed a empirical Bayes based moderated f-test which produces reduced false-positive rates compared to the standard f, and more ad-hoc moderated t-tests such as that used in SAM. This moderated ^test was based on the B statistic developed by Lonnstedt and Speed 27 (2002) . The B statistic is essentially a calculated log posterior odds ratio of differential expression versus non-differential expression that takes into account gene-specific variances while combining the information across many genes. Smyth (2004) extended the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) , resetting the statistic in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The hybrid classical/Bayes approach is proposed by Smyth (2004) in terms of moderated f-statistics, where the posterior odds of differential expression are shown to depend on the data through the moderated f-statistics. This approach can be further generalized to a moderated F-statistic, allowing for tests to be conducting that simultaneously involve two or more contrasts (Smyth 2004) . Motivated by both of these preceding methods, Tai and Speed (2004) propose a onesample multivariate empirical Bayes statistic (the MB-statistic) to rank genes from replicated microarray time course experiments.",

The fixedeffects and mixed ANOVA models are generally a more powerful method to use when there are several sources of variation in the data and when consideration needs to be given to multiple factors (Cui and Churchill, 2003) . Basically, ANOVA models make multiple estimations of variance in order to determine the overall level of variability within multi-factorial experiments by comparing the variation among replicated samples within and between conditions to determine differential expression. A novel method proposed by Draghici et al. (2003) makes use of a loglinear statistical model and an ANOVA approach to model the noise characteristic of multi-channel arrays. This model is then used to identify differentially expressed genes for a given confidence level (Draghici et al. 2003 ).",

A simple, however informal, graphical method for assigning significance is to display the genes by their ranking statistic in a normal or tdistribution plot then selecting the genes whose points deviate markedly from the grouped bulk of genes. Depending on the user, manual selection of a cut-off value can typically result in either an over-or under-estimation in regards to differential expression.",

Calculation of both help determine the confidence that one can have in the results of their data, and in general both types of errors need to be balanced when selecting a cut-off value for differential expression. The problem of multiple testing is that it can increase the number of false-positives and false-negatives within the final Ust of differentially expressed genes. One of the most stringent approaches to the multiple testing problem is to control the FWER which determines the probability of accumulating one or more false-positives errors within the final list of differentially expressed genes, thus increasing confidence that the final list is free from such errors. The simplest procedure for controlling the FWER is the Bonferroni correction (Cui and Churchill, 2003) while Dudoit et al. (2000) propose a more rigorous method for controlling the FWER making use of a re sampling method which computes a step-down adjusted p-value for each gene. A less stringent and possibly more powerful method for addressing the multiple testing problem is to control the FDR, which determines the expected proportion of false-positives within the Ust of differentially expressed genes. In contrast to methods that determine significance levels, the FDR is typically computed after the list of differentially expressed genes has been generated therefore providing a postdata method of confidence. Due to its low stringency, the FDR provides an increased number of genes identified as being truly differentially expressed then that of the FWER.",

On top of this there are still many more fungal genome projects that are underway in both pubHc and private laboratories that have not yet been made accessible. The sequence information from all of these projects can be used to develop fungal species and strain specific whole genome microarrays allowing for high-throughput gene expression studies on a genome-wide scale. Generation of whole-genome arrays will allow for a rapid elucidation of the cellular mechanisms that allow fungi to exist either alone or in a host-pathogen or host-symbiont relationship. Such studies may also lead to the identification of novel pathways by which fungi affect organisms such as plants or humans that can then be targeted by the pharmaceutical or agricultural industries for the development of drugs or fungicides for eradication of invasive, disease causing fimgal pathogens. In regards to the symbiotic relationship of fungi with plants, whole-genome expression analysis studies will help in the elucidation, and possibly identification of cellular and novel mechanisms by which fungi are needed for growth of the host plant. Overall, utilization of microarrays within mycology will provide insight into the function of varying cellular functions of fungi at the gene level.",
