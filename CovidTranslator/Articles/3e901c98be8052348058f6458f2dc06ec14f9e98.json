            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) was first identified in the late 1980s, and is now worldwide in distribution, with the probable exception of Australia and Sweden. It is an important cause of reproductive failure and interstitial pneumonia, and a predisposing factor for bacterial pneumonia and septicemia. The disease varies greatly in severity and clinicopathologic presentation depending on the strain of the Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), the age of pigs affected, the level and distribution of immunity within the herd, and the presence of other pathogens. On initial exposure, infection spreads slowly through the naive herd and causes a variety of clinical presentations: anorexia and lethargy of all age groups; reproductive failure characterized by late term abortion, stillbirth, mummified fetuses, and weak-born piglets; and interstitial pneumonia causing fatal hyperpnea, dyspnea, and lethargy in suckling pigs infected in utero or in the neonatal period, in weaned pigs, and to a lesser extent in grower-finisher pigs. \"Sow abortion and mortality syndrome\" describes a devastating disease resulting from PRRSV infection of naive herds, in which up to half of the sows may abort and sow mortality may reach 10%.",

            "text": "The PRRS virus is an enveloped, 50-65 nm diameter, positivesense, single-stranded RNA virus in the family Arteriviridae. The viral genome includes 8 open reading frames (ORFs): ORF la and l b encode proteins necessary for replication and transcription, ORFs 2-4 encode structural glycoproteins of uncertain function, ORF 5 encodes an envelope glycoprotein, ORF 6 encodes the integral membrane protein M, and ORF 7 encodes the nucleocapsid protein N. Genomic variability is an important feature of PRRSV, and may be attributed to the high mutation rate of RNA polymerase and perhaps recombination between viral strains.As a result, PRRSV isolates vary in terms of the severity of respiratory disease, reactivity in antigen-and nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays, and possibly in patterns of lesions in other organs, including brain and heart. These differences in virulence have not been shown to correlate with simple alterations in specific genes; rather, the virulence of particular strains is apparently determined by a combined effect of many genetic differences.",

            "text": "Infection with PRRSV impairs host defenses, and increases susceptibility to infection with Streptococcus suis, Haemophilus parasuis, Salmonella choleraesuis, and other opportunistic pathogens. Experiments to investigate this effect have been conflicting, and the ability of PRRSV to predispose to other agents is probably dependent on the viral and bacterial strains examined and on the specific experimental conditions. The ability of PRRSV to infect and reduce the function of pulmonary intravascular macrophages is one mechanism whereby PRRSV predisposes to septicemia; a similar impairment of alveolar macrophage functions -including phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and cytokine secretion-may reduce lung defenses against bacterial bronchopneumonia. Subclinical or clinical infection with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae exacerbates the clinical signs and lesions of PRRS, possibly because mycoplasma-induced proliferation and activation of macrophages enhance the replication or persistence of PRRSV. In contrast, infection with PRRSV has little effect on the severity of mycoplasmal lesions. This finding is of clinical importance, as control of M. hyopneumoniae is one strategy for minimizing the effect of PRRSV in endemically infected herds. The effect of PRRSV infection on immune responses to other pathogens has not been fully addressed, but a state of generalized immunosuppression is not a likely feature of PRRS. Animals infected with PRRSV develop apoptosis of alveolar and pulmonary intravascular macrophages, and mononuclear cells in alveolar septa. Because apoptotic cells are more numerous than virus-infected cells, the mechanism of apoptosis may not represent a direct effect of viral infection. Similarly, although interstitial pneumonia is extensive in swine with PRRS, virus-infected cells are relatively infrequent, suggesting a role for host-derived factors such as cytokines in development of lesions.",

The lungs fail to collapse when the diaphragm is incised, occasionally retain impressions of the ribs, and have generalized, patchy, lobular, or diffuse distributions of lesions (Fig. 5.45) .Affected areas of lung are discolored tan or red, and have a firm texture reminiscent of thymus, which contrasts with the crisp hard texture of bacterial pneumonia. A cut section reveals separation of lobules and oozing of edema fluid. In pigs that develop bacterial bronchopneumonia secondary to PRRS, lesions of cranioventral consolidation may be superimposed on the diffuse interstitial pneumonia. In these cases, the lesions of PRRS may be subtle, yet play a critical role in the development of pneumonia in the herd.

Differential diagnoses for the latter include Porcine circovirus type 2 infection, proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia, pseudorabies, Nipah virus infection, and airway injury due to inhaled toxic gases. The diagnosis is confirmed by inoculation of embryonated eggs, with subsequent identification of virus by detection ofhemagglutinating activity. More rapid methods of obtaining a definitive diagnosis include immunohistochemistry on fixed tissues using monoclonal antibodies to conserved type A nucleoproteins, fluorescent antibody testing on frozen sections of affected lung, and polymerase chain reaction. Sample selection is critical for the diagnosis of swine influenza. Viral titers are highest 24 hours after infection, before gross lesions are obvious, and virus often cannot be identified by 72 hours after infection. Consequently, selecting tissue from the cranioventral areas of the lung, from pigs early in the course of the disease, is critical for both histologic and virologic diagnosis. Pigs with a fever are the most suitable subjects for diagnostic investigation.The transient nature of the infection may complicate an investigation of the role of swine influenza in herds with endemic respiratory disease. In these cases, herd-level serology may be useful, as most pigs develop hemagglutination inhibition titers of greater than 1:80 within a week of infection.",

The Apx toxins are potent inducers of cytolysis in porcine neutrophils, alveolar macrophages, erythrocytes, and epithelial cells. Low concentrations induce an oxidative burst in porcine neutrophils. These toxins appear critical to development of disease, as Apx toxin-deficient mutants have reduced virulence, which is restored when the toxin genes are reintroduced. Lipopolysaccharide induces macrophage activation and secretion of neutrophil chemoattractants, procoagulant activity, and complement activation, similar to that described for M. haemolytica. The capsule impairs phagocytosis by macrophages and may prevent complement activation. Isolates with thin capsules may be less pathogenic.APP produces superoxide dismutase, catalase, and hydroperoxide reductase, which may protect against oxidative killing by neutrophils and macrophages.

Mycoplasmas have a relatively small genome, 580-1380kb for the species examined to date, which contains many repetitive elements and a propensity for genomic rearrangement through homologous recombination.

High-frequency variation of surface antigens allows several mycoplasmas to evade the humoral immune response by changing their surface lipoprotein antigens as antibodies against these structures are formed. The mechanisms by which Mycoplasma infections result in disease remain poorly characterized. Mycoplasmas have not been shown to secrete exotoxins. Pathogenic mechanisms of respiratory disease include ciliostasis due to membrane alterations, alteration of host prostaglandin synthesis, induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes or other host cells, and nonantigen-specific stimulation of immune responses as a consequence of superantigens in the mycoplasmal plasma membrane. The latter is the likely factor that induces the prominent peribronchiotar lymphocytic inflammation that is so characteristic of many pulmonary mycoplasmoses. ",

They are believed to be responsible for the occasional transmission of swine influenza virus. The adult worms are white, threadlike, and 14-60 mm in length. In heavy infections, which are mostly in young pigs, they may be found in all lobes of the lung. When there are fewer worms, particularly as occurs in older animals, the worms may be restricted to airways along the caudoventral borders of the caudal lobes. In histologic sections, the adults have polymyarian coelomyarian musculature, cuboidal multinucleate intestinal epithelium with an indistinct microvillus layer, and thick-shelled eggs or embryonated eggs in the uterus. Eggs are laid in the bronchi and a few of them hatch there, but most hatch after passing to the exterior in the feces. First-stage larvae are inactive and are capable of prolonged survival in moist conditions. Their further development depends on ingestion by earthworms, which are the intermediate hosts.The larvae develop to the third, infective stage in about 10 days, and then remain quiescent unless the earthworm is eaten by a pig.The larvae may survive for as long as 18 months in the earthworms and, by that time, thousands may be accumulated by a single worm. Migration within the pig is through the lymphatics from the intestine to the lungs. Some larvae pass through the liver and produce focal hepatitis, as is more commonly caused by Ascaris suum.",

Histologically, the lesions are similar to those produced by Dictyocaulus spp. The initial lesions are multiple loci of intense accumulations of eosinophils surrounding larvae in alveoli.

At this later stage, the adults persist mainly in the bronchioles and small bronchi and provoke goblet-cell hyperplasia and exudation of mucus, eosinophils, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells.The bronchiolar epithelium is mildly hyperplastic, and eosinophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells permeate the lamina propria.

Fluorescent antibody tests and immunohistochemistry are also useful for the diagnosis of BoHV-1 infection, and are advantageous when a rapid diagnosis is needed.A caveat is warranted when diagnosing BoHV-1 infection in the absence of characteristic lesions: cattle with other diseases may experience stress-induced reactivation of latent herpesviral infections, leading to identification of the reactivated virus in any of these diagnostic assays.

Bronchiolitis obliterans may occur as early as 10 days after infection, and consists of plugs of fibrous tissue covered by epithelium that partially occlude bronchiolar lumens.

Bacterial bronchopneumonia is often present in calves with natural or experimental primary BVDV infections, and BVDV infections are common during times of increased susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. Although one must be cognizant of the role of other pathogens in such situations, epidemiologic studies imply that B VDV-infected calves do indeed have a heightened susceptibility to bacterial pneumonia. Mechanisms by which BVDV predisposes to bacterial pneumonia include reduced antimicrobial protein production by virus-infected airway epithelial cells, reduced function of alveolar macrophages, and virus-induced neutropenia. BVDV has also been shown to exacerbate Bovine respiratory syncytial virus and Bovine herpesvirus 1 infections in experimental situations. It has been proposed that some isolates of BVDV induce primary respiratory disease, independent of opportunistic bacterial pathogens. During primary BVDV infection, viral antigen is present in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and in airway epithelium. In addition, viral antigen may be demonstrated in the tunica muscularis of arterioles in the lung, heart, and occasionally in other tissues, often in association with lesions of lymphocytic arteritis. Calves or lambs challenged with certain isolates of BVDV develop fever and hyperpnea or, in other studies, nasal discharge and coughing. The lesions described are mild, consisting of peribronchiolar, perivascular, or interstitial aggregates of lymphocytes and macrophages, and/or mild suppurative exudate in bronchioles. However, other studies have found no lung lesions in calves infected with BVDV, and the importance of B VDV as a cause of primary lung disease is probably minimal.

Massive exudation of fibrin into alveoli is a prominent feature of severe pneumonic pasteurellosis, and is mediated in part by a direct effect oflipopolysaccharide on endothelial cells. However, other mechanisms of vascular leakage also occur, such as exposure of endothelium to macrophage-derived proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-or. Phagocytosis of M. haemolytica by alveolar macrophages is limited unless the bacteria are opsonized by antibody or complement; the significance of other opsonins, such as pulmonary or serum collectins, remains speculative. Alveolar macrophages which have ingested M. haemolytica, or been exposed to bacterial products, secrete an array of neutrophil chemoattractants, including interleukin-8, ENA, GR,O, plateletactivating factor, and leukotriene B4. Neutrophils migrate to the alveoli and terminal bronchioles within 3 hours of experimental challenge with M. haemolytica. Neutrophil migration to alveoli employs a 132 integrin-independent mechanism, whereas neutrophil recruitment to airways is dependent on interactions between 132 integrin and ICAM-1. In contrast to most bacterial infections, in which neutrophils phagocytose and kill the offending bacteria, neutrophils recruited to the sites of established infection with M. haemolytica are probably lysed by the effects of leukotoxin. Thus, this disease is characterized by massive recruitment of neutrophils that are ineffective in killing bacteria, but nonetheless exacerbate the severity of clinical disease. Infiltration of neutrophils and additional macrophages into alveoli is harmful in several ways: the physical presence of these cells precludes normal ventilation and gas exchange; the secretion of oxygen radicals, nitric oxide derivatives, and proteinases secreted by leukocytes may injure pulmonary cells and the interstitial stroma; expression of tissue factor by activated alveolar or intravascular macrophages promotes fibrin formation in the alveolus and thrombosis of blood vessels in the alveolar septa; and both macrophages and neutrophils secrete chemoattractants that perpetuate the recruitment of additional leukocytes.",

The disease is rare in Canada, the USA, and Australia, although infected wildlife reservoirs remain and cases continue to occur in domestic livestock. Most recent reports of bovine tuberculosis in the USA and Canada have occurred in farmed cervids or in localized geographic areas. In most of Europe, fewer than 0.4% of herds are infected, but the prevalence is higher in Ireland, Spain, and Italy. In contrast, bovine tuberculosis is endemic in New Zealand and many, but reportedly not all, countries in Africa, Asia, Central and South America; 10-35% of herds are infected in many of these endemic areas. In many countries, the success of tuberculosis eradication schemes is complicated by wildlife reservoirs, which maintain infection and transmit disease to cattle. Saprophytic mycobacteria are widespread in soil and water, on vegetation, and in mucous membranes of the oropharynx. These organisms typically cause disease in immunologically compromised hosts, and the manifestations are cervical lymphadenitis, pulmonary lesions similar to tuberculosis, or cutaneous lesions associated with local penetration of organisms through wounds. An example is M. marinum, which is abundant in pools in regions with temperate climates and causes tuberculous disease in fish and cutaneous ulcers in humans. This organism is grouped with the photochromogens (1Kunyon's group I) together with M. kansasii. The latter produces cervical lymphadenitis and pulmonary disease in humans, and has been isolated from cow's milk and from cattle in the USA and South Africa.

Heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been identified in cattle and in deer. In humans and mice, mycobacterial resistance is partly related to allelic variation in the natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp) genes 1 and 2, which affect intracellular survival of pathogens by modifying lysosomal transport of divalent cations, including iron and manganese.

In the early phases of infection, bacilli are phagocytosed by macrophages and may be eliminated. Alternatively, infected macrophages may remain at the site of primary infection for prolonged periods before the disease progresses. An initial innate immune response develops at this site of primary infection, as macrophages secrete cytokinesparticularly tumor necrosis factor-or and the C-C chemokines -that recruit additional macrophages and lymphocytes to the site.",

These interferon-T-producing T-helper lymphocytes signal the development of cell-mediated immunity, first detected at 14-28 days after infection by positive tuberculin skin test reactions. The arrival of these antigen-specific lymphocytes is crucial for host defense, activating macrophages and thus allowing them to overcome the block in phagosome maturation, and upregulate production of bactericidal products, including reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates and lysosomal enzymes, killing intracellular bacilli. Activated macrophages appear epithelioid, with abundant cytoplasm and indistinct cell borders, or form multinucleate giant cells.",

Excessive tissue-damaging cell-mediated immune response, called delayed-type hypersensitivity, kills heavily infected macrophages, forming the caseous center of the granuloma. Matrix metalloproteinases released from activated macrophages are a likely cause of the characteristic cell necrosis and liquefaction of tissues in some lesions of tuberculosis. Bacilli within the caseous center do not multiply but may remain dormant as latent infections that may persist for years, until immunosuppression caused by diseases, drugs, hormones, or malnutrition, or other unidentified factors disturb the balance between host and agent, allowing proliferation of the pathogen and reactivation of the disease.",

On the other hand, the delayed-type hypersensitivity response to large amounts of mycobacterial antigen causes extensive cell necrosis and tissue destruction, which is seriously detrimental. Liquefaction, brought about by hydrolytic enzymes of macrophages and possibly neutrophils, is the most harmful response.The bacilli multiply extracellularly in the liquefied material and are available in large numbers for dissemination through cavities, vessels, and airways.

Lung lesions are detected in only 10-20% of cattle with gross lesions, and often affect the caudal lobes. The classic gross lesion is the tubercle: a circumscribed, often encapsulated, 1-40 mm diameter, pale-yellow or white focus of granulomatous inflammation, often with caseous necrosis and~or mineralization (Fig. 5.64 ). Larger lesions may contain liquefied or suppurative exudate and be mistaken for abscesses caused by pyogenic bacteria. Bacilli are released from expanding tubercles into the airways, and coughing up of infected sputum may spread the infection by ingestion to cause lesions in intestine or mesenteric lymph nodes, by adhesion to laryngeal or tracheal mucosa to incite ulcers or ulcerating tubercles, or by aspiration to seed secondary sites in the lung. Multiple, raised, yellow, 1-3 mm plaques on the mucosal surface of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx are early lesions following experimental intranasal infection. Erosion of pulmonary tubercles through the pleura may result in implantation of bacilli throughout the pleural cavity, with development of multiple granulomas on pleural surfaces ( Fig. 5.65 ).

First-stage larvae are expelled from the lung by coughing, are swallowed, and then passed in the feces. Further development to infective third-stage larvae occurs on the ground over the next 5-7 days. Larval development is optimal in moist cool conditions; the larvae can develop at temperatures as low as 5\u00b0C, and their viability is prolonged at these temperatures. The third-stage larvae are ingested by cattle, penetrate the wall of the intestine, and migrate via the lymphatics to the mesenteric lymph nodes. In the lymph nodes, they molt to form fourthstage larvae, and then go by way of lymph and blood to enter the lungs about 7 days after infection. Some larvae accidentally take the portal route and are destroyed in the liver, or rarely enter the systemic circulation to cause intrauterine infections in the fetus. The final molt to the fifth-stage larvae occurs in the bronchioles, and adults develop in the larger airways. Eggs are first detectable in feces at 21-30 days after infection; the infection is usually patent for another 1-3 months.

The seroprevalence varies greatly, for example from 1 to 70% in various areas of the USA. Most infected animals are not clinically ill, and infection may become widespread before diseased animals are noticed. Lentiviruses cause slowly progressive pneumonia, encephalitis, arthritis, and mastitis; the various syndromes may occur independently or concurrently.The descriptive terminology of the ovine disease is a colorful consequence of the history of the disease.The respiratory form in sheep, which is termed maedi (\"dyspnea\" in Icelandic) in much of the world and ovine progressive pneumonia in the USA, is the most common presentation, and manifests as inexorably progressive dyspnea, hyperpnea, and weight loss in sheep greater than 3 years of age. Other outcomes in sheep are less frequent and include encephalitis, arthritis, and mastitis. Encephalitisvisna (\"fading away\" in Icelandic) -was common in the original Icelandic description but is now a rare expression of the disease, and results in ataxia, trembling, and profound weight loss. Mastitis and arthritis are uncommon in sheep, and manifest as agalactia and a hard udder, or lameness and swollen joints (particularly carpal joints) respectively. Caprine arthritis encephalitis virus (CAEV) causes two common clinical diseases. The first, arthritis in adult goats, results in acute or chronic lameness and swelling of carpal or tarsal joints. The second manifestation, neurologic disease in 2-4-month-old kids or less commonly in older animals, is characterized by progressive ataxia and weakness beginning in the hindlimbs. Pneumonia, which is less frequent than arthritis and neurologic disease, may occasionally be the major presenting complaint in kids or adults, or occur concurrently with arthritis or neurologic disease.",

However, viral replication is restricted in these cells, and complete viral replication and assembly only occur in mature macrophages. Viral antigen is widespread, having been detected in lung, bone marrow, mammary gland, lymph node, spleen, synovium, brain, and spinal cord of sheep with maedi, and is most abundant in areas of lymphocytic inflammation. Similarly, viral nucleic acid is demonstrable in lung, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, brain, synovium, intestine, kidney, and thyroid gland of goats with CAE.",

As well, epizootics of influenza occur when new antigenic variants of influenza viruses emerge. Serologic studies suggest that 19 and 24% of horses with upper respiratory disease seroconvert to A/equi/1 and A/equi/2 influenza viruses, respectively, in the 28 days after illness. As for influenza in swine and humans, the disease in horses is usually characterized by high morbidity and low mortality, unless secondary bacterial pneumonia develops. However, introduction of certain strains of A/equi/2 influenza virus into naive populations has caused outbreaks in which most horses became ill and up to 35% died. Most outbreaks spread rapidly through groups of horses, and are characterized by acute onset of fever of less than 4 days' duration, severe nonproductive cough, mucopurulent nasal discharge, lethargy, and anorexia. Dependent edema is an uncommon finding. Although most clinical signs resolve within 1-2 weeks, coughing may persist for weeks or months. General features of orthomyxoviruses are described with swine influenza. H7N7 influenza virus, designated A/equi/1, was an important cause of equine respiratory disease in the 1950s, but has not been isolated since 1978. Nevertheless, the continued presence of antibody titers suggests that this virus continues to cause subclinical infections.

Environmental factors favoring the disease include hot seasonal temperatures in temperate climates, neutral soil pH, and repetitive high-density stocking of dry paddocks. The clinical presentation may be either acute or insidiously progressive, although the infection and lesions are invariably chronic by the time clinical signs are noted. Affected foals usually develop disease in the summer, and are presented with pyrexia, tachypnea, dyspnea, cough, and mucopurulent nasal discharge.

Animals with the colonic form of disease may have diarrhea, weight loss, ascites due to hypoproteinemia, and occasionally colic.

The hyaluronic acid capsule is necessary for virulence, mediates binding of the bacterium to host cells, and confers resistance to phagocytosis. The M protein and a second cell wall protein bind fibrinogen and prevent deposition of complement factor C3b, thereby blocking recognition and phagocytosis by macrophages. Peptidoglycan activates complement by the alternative pathway, inciting recruitment of neutrophils to sites of infection. The fact that many of the recruited neutrophils rapidly undergo necrosis may be an effect of streptolysin-S and another cytotoxin. S. equi in exudates can survive for many months in the external environment, and may be transmitted by fomites. The initial source of infection, however, is usually a carrier animal or one with active but not necessarily obvious clinical disease. The incubation period of strangles is 3-4 days, although it may be as short as 2 or as long as 15 days. The pathogenesis of the infection involves rapid transport of bacteria from the tonsil to local lymph nodes, and adhesion to nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. There is intense chemotaxis of neutrophils to the mucosa and regional lymph nodes, yet the organisms resist phagocytosis and neutrophil-mediated killing. Recovery from strangles confers immunity in about 75% of horses, associated with immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibody produced locally in the nasopharynx.Although antibodies to M protein confer partial immunity, other protective antigens are not yet fully defined. The submandibular and retropharyngeal nodes are the first and usually the most severely affected. The swollen lymph nodes are initially firm, but this swelling becomes fluctuant as the suppurative exudate liquefies. The typical and favorable outcome of the lymphadenitis is for the abscesses to rupture on to the skin 1-3 weeks after onset of infection, releasing creamy yellow-white pus containing numerous infective bacteria.

Lymphoid lesions may be inapparent on gross examination, or there may be either atrophy or edematous swelling.Thymic atrophy is particularly common. In the earliest lesions following experimental infection, there is depletion of lymphocytes in the cortical zone of the lymph nodes within 6 days of infection. By day 9, the lymph nodes and spleen contain lymphocytic necrosis and depletion, and infiltration of neutrophils. Syncytial cells may form in the nodes and these often contain inclusion bodies. Approximately 2 weeks after exposure, hyperplasia of histiocytic cells develops, but repopulation of the node by lymphocytes may be delayed for weeks or months. Thymic atrophy is due both to loss of cortical thymocytes as well as to great reduction in the medulla.",

Generalized diffuse reddening with firm texture is a less common manifestation. Histologically, bronchioles contain scant suppurative exudate, there is patchy necrosis and attenuation of bronchiolar epithelium, and lymphocytes are present around bronchioles.

Their passage through the pleura is marked by multiple small hemorrhages and loci of eosinophilic and fibrinous pleuritis that heal as small umbilicated scars.Adult flukes are ovoid, red-brown, and up to 17 mm in length.They are often found in pairs in inflammatory cavitations in the pulmonary parenchyma and occasionally in the bronchi. The cavitations frequently communicate with bronchioles, permitting liberation of eggs into the airways, expulsion to the nasopharynx, and passage in the feces.",

In patent infections, there are numerous 80-100 p~m long, yellowbrown, operculate eggs, which persist as fractured shells in chronic lesions (Fig. 5.99 ).As cavitations mature and establish connections with bronchioles, they become partially lined by cuboidal epithelium to form true cysts. At this stage, bronchioles contain eggs and eosinophilic exudate, with hyperplasia of peribronchiolar glands and smooth muscle. Other lesions include chronic catarrhal eosinophilic bronchiolitis, granulomatous pleuritis, and pleural lymphangitis associated with the presence of eggs. Rupture of the cysts may rarely cause pneumothorax. ",

Humoral antibodies can be demonstrated by serologic techniques, but do not participate in the development of lesions or in the production of immunity. Cell-mediated responses are responsible for both aspects of the disease. The method of transmission influences the spectrum of lesions of bovine tuberculosis. Inhalation of droplet nuclei or dust particles containing M. boris is the most common route of infection and leads to infection of the upper and lower airways. Oral infection requires a greater dose of bacilli than airborne infection to cause disease, and elicits lesions in the gut and associated lymph nodes.

ZentraLbL Veterinarmed B 1978:25:469-477. Hendro virus Hendra virus (HeV) was first described in 1994 in Australia, as a cause of fatal pulmonary disease of horses. The virus also causes disease in humans, cats, and guinea pigs. Subclinical infections in fruit bats (flying foxes) are likely sources of infection for other mammals. HeV and the related Nipah virus are members of the genus Henipavirus, family Paramyxoviridae. He V has tropism for endothelial cells, and many of the lesions arise from vascular injury.Viral particles are detectable in the cytoplasm of endothelial cells. Gross lesions in horses include prominent pulmonary edema and congestion with dilation of subpleural lymphatic vessels, petechial hemorrhages, and abundant tracheal froth. The most prominent histologic lesion is serofibrinous fluid and increased numbers of macrophages in alveoli. Closer inspection may reveal subtle vascular lesions in the lung, heart, glomeruli, and stomach, consisting of thrombi in capillaries and/or necrotic debris and hemorrhage in the walls of arterioles.The presence of syncytial cells in small vessels is a unique but inconsistent lesion. The differential diagnosis for massive pulmonary edema includes African horse sickness, heart failure, and anaphylaxis.

Infection of adult horses often results in failure of the worm to develop to sexual maturity, and larvae cannot be detected in the feces of these animals. The worms can mature if horses or ponies are infected as young foals. The gross lesions are scattered, wedge-shaped foci of overinflation, mostly in caudal lobes. In the center of the lesions are small bronchi packed with coiled adult worms. Histologically, the worms are associated with goblet-cell hyperplasia and lymphocytic infiltrates.Adult worms cause relatively little luminal response, whereas first-stage larvae stimulate an intense mucopurulent reaction, or chronic catarrhal and eosinophilic bronchiolitis.Parascaris equorum larval migration may cause nodular lesions in the lung. The acute lesions are distinctive by virtue of the mass of eosinophils present and the occasional presence of ascarid larvae in bronchioles or alveoli. However, the chronic nodules consist of aggregates of lymphoid tissue with fibrosis and mineralization, and need to be differentiated from residual lesions of small abscesses or granulomas.Miscellaneous parasitisms include Schistosoma nasalis, a cause of nasal granuloma in India; hydatid cysts; and Habronema spp., a rare cause of fibrotic nodules adjacent to bronchioles.BibliographyCtayton HM, Duncan JL.

European and American isolates of PRCoV differ, and apparently developed independently from TGEV. Following experimental challenge, neonatal pigs develop viremia and respiratory infection, whereas in 5-weekold pigs, viral antigen is limited to the respiratory tract, particularly alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages. Lesions of naturally infected pigs are not described. In experimental cases, there is necrosis of bronchiolar epithelium, mild proliferation of type II pneumocytes, mononuclear cell infiltrates in alveolar septa, and lymphocytes and macrophages in alveoli. Most field cases are subclinical, and the major importance is that antibodies to PRCo V cross-react with those to TGEV, leading to false-positive serologic tests in swine herds that are expected to be free of TGE V. Diagnosis at necropsy is based on isolation or indirect fluorescent antibody tests.Virus neutralization tests and some enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) do not differentiate P1LCoV from TGEV antibodies, but newer blocking ELISAs do differentiate these coronaviruses.Ahn K, eta[.

Sequestra caused by M. boris are indistinguishable from those caused by Mannheimia haemolytica or H. somni, unless typical foci of caseous necrosis are detected in the adjacent consolidated lung tissue. Various techniques are available to confirm the tentative diagnosis of Mycoplasma boris. It grows readily on Mycoplasma enrichment media, and is occasionally isolated on blood agar. However, many calves without apparent pneumonia are infected with M. bovis. Thus, the diagnosis rests on identifying both infection with this agent and the presence of the characteristic lesions. Immunohistochemistry is also advantageous for correlating the location of mycoplasmal antigen with the characteristic lesions.

In some cases, clinical signs are primarily due to secondary infections that are a consequence ofvirus-induced immunosuppression, probably an effect of viral infection of lymphocytes and macrophages.

Because most of the pathogens involved are commonly isolated from healthy dogs, a diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia should prompt a search for predisposing causes. Aspiration pneumonia may result from megaesophagus, anesthesia, coma, or other causes of regurgitation or vomiting. Alternatively, bacterial pneumonia may arise as a consequence of impaired respiratory defenses.These include respiratory viral infections, particularly canine distemper, parainfluenza, or adenovirus-2; immunosuppressive therapy that induces immunosuppression or neutropenia; concurrent disease conditions that impair immune responses or neutrophil function, including uremia, hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, parvoviral enteritis, systemic mycoses, or primary immunodeficiencies; ciliary dyskinesia; and environmental and social stresses.Multiple bacterial pathogens are isolated from the lung of many dogs with bacterial pneumonia, as would be expected if the primary problem in these dogs is failure of lung defenses.

Mycoplasmas that infect the respiratory tract of dogs include Mycoplasma canis, M. cynos, M. bovigenitalium, M. spumans, M. edwardii, M.gatae, M.feliminutum, and several unclassified species of Myc0plasma, Ureaplasma, and Acholeplasma. Mycoplasmas are present in the nasopharynx of most normal dogs, and can be isolated from tracheobronchial washes from about 30% of normal adult dogs and a similar percentage of those with pneumonia. Mycoplasmas are more likely to be isolated from young dogs with septic inflammation and colonization of airways by aerobic bacteria. However, it remains possible that mycoplasmas secondarily colonize airways that are injured by other pathogens, for many dogs with suppurative pneumonia are concurrently infected with mycoplasmas and other bacterial pathogens. Experimental infection with M. cynos did not result in clinical signs of disease, but did induce peribronchial infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells, exfoliation and hyperplasia of bronchiolar epithelium, and neutrophil exudation into bronchioles and alveoli. Experimental infection with M. bovigenitalium resulted in mild suppurative and lymphocytic bronchiolitis. Pathologic changes were not apparent in dogs challenged with M. spumans, M. canis, or M. gatae. Clinical signs were not apparent in any of the Mycoplasmachallenged dogs. Unclassified mycoplasmas have been associated with similar lesions and with chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis in dogs. Thus, although M. cynos may induce mild pulmonary lesions, and although Mycoplasma sp. colonizes the lungs of many dogs with pneumonia, the importance and prevalence of Mycoplasma sp. as a primary cause of lung disease in dogs are uncertain.

Neoplastic nodules are often larger and more variable in size than the lesions ofblastomycosis; examination of impression smears or histologic sections readily differentiates the two. Morphologic features are usually adequate to differentiate Blastomyces from other fungi: Cryptococcus neoformans usually has a thick capsule and only a mild inflammatory response, Histoplasma capsulatum at 2-4 ~m is much smaller and resides in the cytoplasm of macrophages, andCoccidioides immitis at 20-200 p~m is much larger and often contains endospores. Mutants of Cryptococcus that lack the characteristic thick capsule may closely resemble Blastomyces and incite a similar Cryptococcosis, also referred to as European blastomycosis, is a mycotic disease of worldwide distribution. Cryptococcosis is the most common systemic mycotic disease of cats, and also affects dogs, horses, cattie, humans, and many other species. Disease is sporadic and, as is usually true for the systemic mycoses, the infection is apparently neither contagious nor zoonotic. Most cases have chronic nasal disease, with sneezing and serous or mucopurulent discharge. Other common manifestations include ulcerating cutaneous nodules, neurologic disease, chorioretinitis or panophthalmitis, and pneumonia. neoformans is a basidiomycete yeast-like fungus.Unlike the dimorphic fungi Blastomyces and Coccidioides, the sexual mycelial phase of Cryptococcus does not occur under normal laboratory .................

C. neoformans ssp. neoformans, the usual cause in temperate climates, is a saprophyte Found in soil, pigeon or other avian guano, and decaying organic matter. C. neoformans ssp. gatti is Found mainly in association with eucalyptus trees in tropical climates. Four serotypes are defined by antigenic variation of\" the capsule; serotypes A and D comprise C. neoformans ssp. neoformans, and serotypes B and C comprise C. neoformans ssp. gatti. Most infected animals do not develop clinical disease. It is commonly assumed that, as in humans, clinical disease only develops if immune responses are impaired by malnutrition, corticosteroid therapy, or immunosuppressive lentiviral infection. However, predisposing causes of immunosuppression are not often discovered in naturally occurring cases in cats. Infection is mainly acquired by inhalation of basidiospores (yeast cells) from contaminated dust. Most cases develop nasal disease, and infection may progress by local spread to the brain, aspiration to the lung, or hematogenous spread to brain, eyes, lymph nodes, skin, and other organs. Occasional cases of cutaneous cryptococcosis are probably the result of local inoculation, and crTptococcal mastitis in cows is an ascending rather than hematogenous infection.

Linguatula serrata, a member of the phylum Pentastomida, is of wide geographic distribution. Adult pentastomes are large, long-lived, specialized hematophagous parasites of the respiratory tracts of reptiles, amphibians, and carnivorous mammals.They are related to, but distinct from, the arthropods.The adults of L. serrata are transversely striated and tongue-shaped (hence the name). Males are \"--2 cm in length and females 1.0-1.2 cm. The definitive hosts are carnivores, but in aberrant parasitisms herbivores and humans may be host to the final stage. Herbivorous animals are the intermediate hosts. Carnivores are infected by eating the infected viscera of herbivores, and the nymphs migrate to the nasal passages, where they mature. The parasites may be found anywhere in the nasal cavity, and occasionally they find their way into the paranasal sinuses or pass via the eustachian tube to the inner ear.They lie on the surface of the nasal mucosa and induce nasal irritation and a catarrhal to lightly bloodstained exudate.The gravid females discharge a large number of eggs that are removed by sneezing.The larvae develop in the alimentary tract of the intermediate host and migrate to the mesenteric lymph nodes and other organs, where they encyst and develop into infective nymphs.

Eucoleus aerophilus (Capillaria aerophila) is a trichurid nematode (order Enoplida, superfamily Trichuroidea, family Trichuridae) that parasitizes the trachea and bronchi of wild canids, domestic dogs, and occasionally cats. The worms are slender, 2-3 cm long, and embedded in the airway mucosa. Histologic examination reveals characteristic features: bacillary bands, which are segmental thickenings of the hypodermis; a stichosome, which is a deeply basophilic gland encircling the esophagus; and the possible presence of embryonated eggs. The eggs are laid in the airways, move with mucus to the pharynx, are swallowed and passed in the feces. The eggs are oval with bipolar plugs, and closely resemble those of Trichuris vulpis of the intestine or Pearsonema (Capillaria) plica of the urinary bladder. The larvae undergo initial development in the egg, and then progress to the infective stage within earthworms, which are a required intermediate host. Eggs also hatch in about 40 days under suitable environmental conditions, but the resulting larvae are apparently not infective. After ingestion of the earthworm, the larvae reach the lungs in -1 week and are mature in the trachea in about 25 days. Most infestations of E. aerophilus are inapparent and provoke only mild catarrhal inflammation. Heavy infestations cause more severe irritation that may result in obstruction of the lumen of the airways. Chronic coughing and intermittent dyspnea may then be observed, and secondary bacterial bronchopneumonia may occur. A related trichurid, E. (Capillaria) bohmi, is occasionally reported in the nasal cavity and sinuses of wild canids and rarely in domestic dogs. Barrs VR, et at.
