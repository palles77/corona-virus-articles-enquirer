Based on studies of BAR domains in isolation, the current paradigm is that they polymerize into cylindrical scaffolds that stabilize lipid tubules, preventing membrane fission. But in nature BAR domains are often part of multi-domain proteins that contain large intrinsically-disordered regions. Using in vitro and live cell assays, here we show that full-length BAR domaincontaining proteins, rather than stabilizing membrane tubules, are instead surprisingly potent drivers of membrane fission. Specifically, when BAR scaffolds assemble at membrane surfaces, their bulky disordered domains become crowded, generating steric pressure that destabilizes lipid tubules. More broadly, we observe this behavior with BAR domains that have a range of curvatures. These data challenge the idea that cellular membranes adopt the curvature of BAR scaffolds, suggesting instead that the ability to concentrate disordered domains is the key requirement for membrane remodeling and fission by BAR domain-containing proteins.",

            "text": "Importantly, most studies on the membrane shaping behavior of BAR domains have examined the BAR domain in isolation, with significant portions of the protein removed. Examples include the N-terminal amphipathic helix BAR (N-BAR) domain of amphiphysin (Peter et al., 2004) , the FCH BAR (F-BAR) domain of FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010; Henne et al., 2007) , the F-BAR domain of the neuronal migration protein srGAP2 (Guerrier et al., 2009) , the F-BAR domains of the cytokinesis proteins Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) and Cdc15 (McDonald et al., 2015) , and the inverted BAR (I-BAR) domains of MIM and ABBA (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009 ), among others. These results have provided critical insight into the detailed geometry of BAR domain arrangement at membrane surfaces, helping to elucidate their mechanisms of membrane curvature sensing and induction. However, BAR domains do not typically exist in isolation in the cell, but rather as part of large, multi-domain proteins which also frequently contain long, intrinsically-disordered protein (IDP) domains of several hundred amino acids (Henne et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2007; Miele et al., 2004; Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015) . How might these disordered domains influence the membrane remodeling behavior of BAR domains? cells -what brings bulky domains together to generate steric pressure? In particular, what keeps crowded proteins from simply diffusing away from one another, dissipating steric pressure and inhibiting membrane shaping? Proteins such as amphiphysin (Miele et al., 2004; Peter et al., 2004) and FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010; Henne et al., 2007) , which contain both scaffold-forming BAR domains and bulky disordered domains, present a possible solution to this problem. Specifically, the ability of BAR domains to form scaffolds has the potential to locally concentrate disordered domains such that steric pressure is amplified rather than dissipated.",

These experiments revealed that both the N-BAR domain and Amph-FL drove potent membrane bending, forming mobile, diffraction-limited tubules that extended from the GUV surface (Fig. S1A , Movies S1 and S2).

In the first of these experiments, we used supported bilayers with extra membrane reservoir (SUPER templates), which are glass beads surrounded by a low-tension membrane. Exposure of SUPER templates to fission-driving proteins results in measurable membrane release from the beads Pucadyil and Schmid, 2008) . SUPER template experiments revealed that while both N-BAR and Amph-FL drove membrane release in the concentration range of 50-1,000 nM, Amph-FL drove more than twice as much (2.6 to 4.7-fold greater) membrane release at each concentration (Fig. 1F) . Notably, membrane release does not directly imply efficient membrane fission, as both vesicles and lipid tubules can be shed from SUPER templates. Therefore, we next employed a tethered vesicle assay to quantify the distributions of fission vesicle diameters over a range of protein concentrations (Snead et al., 2017) . Specifically, we tethered fluorescent vesicles to a coverslip passivated with PEG and PEG-biotin ( Fig. 2A) . Vesicles in these experiments contained a biotinylated lipid, which facilitated tethering to the substrate via binding to neutravidin. Vesicles also contained the fluorescent lipid Oregon Green 488-DHPE, which we used to quantify the brightness of each vesicle after imaging in confocal fluorescence microscopy (Aguet et al., 2013) (Fig. 2B ). We then converted the resulting distributions of vesicle brightness to approximate distributions of vesicle diameter by calibrating against the initial vesicle diameter distribution measured using dynamic light scattering (see methods).",

The proportion of vesicles that fell within the high curvature group (diameters below approximately 45 nm) increased with increasing protein concentration, from less than 1% at 50 nM to approximately 38% at 150 nM (Fig. 2F ). In contrast, the N-BAR domain did not drive fission, even at higher protein concentrations (Fig. 2B , E, and F). While lipid tubules were not apparent in tethered vesicle experiments with N-BAR (Fig. 2B ), tubules were observed at micromolar N-BAR concentrations (Fig. S1E) , consistent with the tubules formed in TEM experiments (Fig. 1C) . Notably, higher concentrations of Amph-FL were required to observe fission in TEM experiments compared to tethered vesicle experiments. This increase is due to the high lipid concentration used in TEM experiments (approximately 100-fold greater than tethered vesicle experiments), which is necessary to achieve an adequate density of lipid structures for TEM (see methods). Taken together, our results from electron microscopy and tethered vesicle experiments confirm that Amph-FL is a potent driver of membrane fission, while the isolated N-BAR domain is only capable of forming membrane tubules.

FCS experiments also showed that the size of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 varied with the concentration of monovalent salt in the buffer (Fig. S2J) , consistent with the known sensitivity of highly-charged disordered proteins to changes in ionic strength (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . We next performed tethered vesicle experiments to assess membrane fission by Amph CTD \u2206SH3. The protein included an N-terminal hexa-histidine (6his) tag to facilitate binding to membranes by the lipid DOGS-NTA-Ni (Fig. 3A) . Experiments revealed that Amph CTD \u2206SH3 indeed drove the formation of highly curved fission products (Fig. 3B,C) .

At this coverage, steric pressure from protein crowding is expected to be sufficient to overcome the energetic barrier to membrane fission (Snead et al., 2017) . Therefore, the requirement for a high solution concentration of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 reflects the conditions necessary to promote crowded binding to the membrane surface. In contrast, the ability of Amph-FL to drive fission at much lower concentrations likely arises from polymerization of the BAR domain scaffold, which enables multivalent membrane binding (Simunovic et al., 2016; Sorre et al., 2012) . In line with this thinking, we found that 100 nM Amph-FL, a concentration which drove potent fission (Fig. 2D ,F), covered greater than 70% of the membrane surface (Fig. S2F ). This coverage is significantly higher than has been observed for non-assembling proteins (Feder, 1980; Snead et al., 2017) . Collectively, these results suggest that the ability of amphiphysin to drive efficient membrane fission arises from a collaboration between its N-BAR domain and disordered domain. respectively) as well as hydrodynamic radius . Tethered vesicle fission experiments revealed that N-BAR-epsin CTD generated highly curved fission products from vesicles with an initial average diameter of 200 nm within a similar range of protein concentrations to Amph-FL (Fig. 3F , compare to Fig. 2D ). Further, both N-BAR-epsin CTD and Amph-FL produced a very similar fraction of fission products with diameters below 45 nm at equivalent concentrations in solution (Fig. 3G) . Finally, SUPER template membrane shedding experiments revealed that in the concentration range of 50-1,000 nM, N-BAR-epsin CTD drove greater membrane release compared to the isolated N-BAR domain (Fig. 3H) , similar to the results of SUPER template experiments comparing N-BAR and Amph-FL (Fig. 1F ). These findings illustrate the ability of N-BAR scaffolds to promote membrane fission by crowding arbitrary disordered domains at membrane surfaces.",

One explanation is that steric pressure among the bulky disordered domains of Amph-FL inhibits the assembly of a long-range N-BAR scaffold, which, if allowed to form, would inhibit fission. In support of this hypothesis, when Amph-FL reached over 70% surface coverage as described above (Fig. S2F) , the underlying N-BAR domain covered only about 16% of the membrane, based on membrane footprints for Amph-FL and N-BAR of 79 and 16.5 nm 2 per monomer, respectively (see methods). This coverage is significantly lower than expected for a fully-assembled N-BAR scaffold, which approaches complete coverage (Adam et al., 2015; . Furthermore, the volume available per amphiphysin disordered domain above the N-BAR scaffold is only about 50% of the volume that each domain would be expected to occupy in solution, based on its radius of gyration (Fig. 3I , see calculation in methods). Therefore, the disordered domains would be required to compress substantially to fit around a fullyassembled N-BAR scaffold. Previous work has shown that substantial compression of disordered domains is energetically costly, likely exceeding the cost of membrane deformation . Collectively, these arguments suggest that the presence of amphiphysin's bulky disordered domains inhibits assembly of long-range N-BAR scaffolds.",

These structures have been observed on membrane substrates containing a majority of negatively-charged lipids, which are thought to provide a strong electrostatic driving force for scaffold assembly (Adam et al., 2015; . Therefore, we performed tethered vesicle fission experiments using a similar membrane composition (Fig. S3) . Here, the onset of membrane fission occurred at somewhat higher Amph-FL concentration, 350 nM ( Fig. S3 ) in comparison to 75 nM ( Fig.  2B -F). These results demonstrate that high concentrations of negatively charged lipids cannot prevent membrane fission as protein concentration increases. Indeed, the cryoelectron microscopy studies cited above suggest that long-range scaffolds assembled from full-length protein were more rare . Moreover, these studies employed buffers that lacked small monovalent ions (Adam et al., 2015; , conditions known to favor extension of disordered domains owing to reduced electrostatic screening (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . This environment likely enabled the disordered domains to pack more efficiently around the scaffold, in line with the needle-like densities seen protruding from the N-BAR scaffold (Adam et al., 2015) .",

We first replicated these findings by overexpressing the N-BAR domain of human amphiphysin tagged with mCherry ( Fig. 4A ) in retinal pigmented epithelial (RPE) cells. We found that N-BAR generated a dense network of tubules inside the cells (Fig. 4B ), in agreement with previous findings (Peter et al., 2004) . The number of tubules per cell increased with the expression level of N-BAR (Fig. 4C) , and co-localized with a plasma membrane stain (Fig. S4A) , indicating that many of the tubules originated from the plasma membrane as previously observed (McDonald et al., 2015; McDonald et al., 2016) . In contrast, overexpression of Amph-FL tagged with mCherry ( Fig. 4A ) led to significantly fewer tubules per cell compared to N-BAR ( Fig. 4 B-D), suggesting that the disordered domain of Amph-FL inhibited tubule formation.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we created a chimera of N-BAR fused to an alternative disordered domain, from the neuronal protein neurofilament-M (N-BAR-NfM CTD), tagged with mCherry (Fig. 4A) . The disordered C-terminal domain of neurofilament-M acts as an entropic brush, radiating outward along the length of neurofilaments and sterically repelling neighboring disordered domains to control axon diameter (Brown and Hoh, 1997; Kumar et al., 2002) . The neurofilament-M disordered domain is similar in length to that of amphiphysin (438 versus 383 amino acids, respectively) but is not involved in endocytosis and therefore contains no binding domains for endocytic proteins. Overexpressing N-BAR-NfM CTD in RPE cells resulted in a similar phenotype to Amph-FL, in which the number of tubules per cell was significantly reduced compared to the isolated N-BAR domain (Fig. 4 B-D) . Furthermore, while tubules in N-BAR-expressing cells had an average length of 6.0\u00b10.2 \u00b5m s.e.m., tubule lengths in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD were significantly shorter, 3.5\u00b10.1 and 3.6\u00b10.1 \u00b5m s.e.m., respectively (Fig. 4E ).",

Specifically, the tubules in cells expressing N-BAR had an average lifetime of approximately 75\u00b15 s s.e.m., whereas tubule lifetime was significantly shorter in cells expressing Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD, approximately 29\u00b13 and 35\u00b14 s s.e.m., respectively (Fig. 4F ). The tubules formed by N-BAR also had greater fluorescence intensity in the protein channel relative to the local background in comparison to Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD (Fig. S4B ,C). This finding indicates that the disordered domains of Amph-FL and N-BAR-NfM CTD did not promote tubule fission by enhancing protein binding to the membrane surface. Collectively, results from experiments in live cells indicate that bulky disordered domains are capable of disrupting the formation of stable tubules scaffolded by BAR domains, similar to observations in vitro ( Fig. 1C ,D). The disordered domains may have inhibited tubule formation by driving membrane fission, though future work is needed to test the role of disordered domains in physiological fission events.",

To make this comparison, we created a chimeric protein that places the two mechanisms in direct competition within the same molecule. Specifically, we fused the inverted BAR (I-BAR) domain of human IRSp53 to the bulky, C-terminal disordered domain of rat AP180 (569 disordered amino acids) to form I-BAR-AP180 CTD (Fig. 5A ). While the I-BAR domain is known to generate inverted membrane curvature (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009) , the attached disordered domains should generate steric pressure that will tend to bend the membrane in the opposite direction. Exposing GUVs to the I-BAR domain alone drove inverted membrane tubulation, as expected (Fig. 5B , left and Movie S6). In contrast, the I-BAR-AP180 CTD chimera drove neither inward nor outward tubulation. Instead, the protein caused the GUV membrane to fluctuate dynamically through non-spherical shapes in which regions of gentle membrane curvature extending both inward and outward were apparent, (Fig. 5B , right and Movie S7). These \"frustrated\" fluctuations demonstrate that the disordered domain effectively neutralized the ability of the I-BAR domain to drive inward membrane bending. This result suggests that crowding among disordered domains and scaffolding by BAR domains make comparable contributions to membrane remodeling.",

This result demonstrates that, under appropriate conditions, steric pressure among crowded disordered domains is sufficient to overcome the structure-based curvature preference of the I-BAR scaffold. Importantly, while wild-type IRSp53 does not naturally contain a large disordered domain, the I-BAR domain-containing proteins MIM and ABBA do contain regions of substantial disorder (approximately 475 amino acids in MIM) (Lee et al., 2007) . Therefore, our observations raise the question of whether the presumed role of these proteins in driving cellular membrane protrusions can be justified on the basis of in vitro studies of their isolated I-BAR domains (Mattila et al., 2007; Saarikangas et al., 2009 ).",

Interestingly, many proteins that contain the modestly-curved F-BAR domain also have this architecture (Roberts-Galbraith and Gould, 2010), including the endocytic proteins FCHo1/2 (Henne et al., 2010) and its yeast homolog Syp1 (Reider et al., 2009) , the srGAP proteins involved in neuronal development (Wuertenberger and Groemping, 2015) , and the cytokinesis proteins Cdc15 and Imp2 (McDonald et al., 2016) in S. pombe and Hof1 (Meitinger et al., 2011) in S. cerevisiae. To test this idea, we examined FCHo1 (C. elegans), which consists of an Nterminal F-BAR domain followed by an intrinsically disordered domain of 412 amino acids and a C-terminal \u00b5-homology domain (Henne et al., 2010; Ma et al., 2016; Umasankar et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016) (Fig. 5E ).

Notably, vesicles in these experiments were composed primarily of the lipid DOPC, which has a lower bending rigidity than physiological membranes (Dimova, 2014) . In contrast, when we increased bilayer rigidity by replacing DOPC with the substantially more rigid, fully-saturated lipid DPPC (Dimova, 2014; Lee et al., 2001) , the average diameter of fission products increased to approximately 50 nm at 50 nM of FCHo1-FL, consistent with bilayer vesicles (Fig. S5E-G) . Collectively, these studies show that, despite their gentle curvature, F-BAR scaffolds are also capable of collaborating with disordered domain crowding to drive efficient membrane fission, producing highly curved vesicles.

Further, our findings are in contrast with the established view that BAR scaffolds prevent fission by stabilizing membrane tubes (Boucrot et al., 2012) . Instead, our work suggests that BAR proteins that contain substantial disordered regions are more likely to be drivers of membrane fission. In support of this idea, previous work showed that the yeast amphiphysins Rvs161/167 are essential for membrane fission, and deletion of these proteins leads to a defect in the entry of clathrin-coated pits into cells (Kaksonen et al., 2005; Kishimoto et al., 2011) . Depletion of amphiphysin by RNA interference also dramatically inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis in mammalian cells (Meinecke et al., 2013) , although this endocytic defect has been attributed to a reduction in dynamin recruitment.",

One potential example is dynamin, a scaffold-forming GTPase involved in fission of clathrin-coated pits (Antonny et al., 2016) . While dynamin itself does not contain substantial regions of disorder, it assembles with proteins that contain such domains, including amphiphysin and SNX9 (Daumke et al., 2014) . Once recruited by dynamin, these proteins may generate significant steric pressure at membrane necks. In line with this thinking, previous in vitro studies found that amphiphysin acts synergistically with dynamin to enhance membrane fission (Meinecke et al., 2013; . Moreover, the yeast dynamin homolog, Vps1, is dispensable for fission, but is necessary for proper localization and accumulation of amphiphysin at clathrincoated pits (Kaksonen et al., 2005; Smaczynska-de Rooij et al., 2010) . A function of Vps1 could therefore be to organize and concentrate bulky disordered domains at membrane necks to promote fission.",

The hydrodynamic radius, 6 , of each protein is also reported next to each trace. AP180 CTD was used as a calibration standard to compute 6 of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 , as / is directly proportional to 6 . AP180 CTD is a disordered protein with a radius that has been wellcharacterized Kalthoff et al., 2002) , making it an appropriate calibration standard. This calibration approach also yielded a radius for transferrin that was consistent with its expected radius (Hall et al., 2002) , confirming the validity of our approach. The radius of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 was taken as 5 nm in estimates of membrane coverage by proteins in Fig. 3D , S2A-F, and S2K-M. This value was chosen based on previous studies which found that the radius of gyration of a disordered protein is approximately 1.2-fold greater than the hydrodynamic radius (Hofmann et al., 2012; Sherman and Haran, 2006 ). (Zhang and Han, 1996) . Because / is directly proportional to 6 , the increase in / at 10 mM NaCl indicates an increase in 6 , likely owing to reduced charge screening which expands and extends the disordered protein (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . Similarly, the decrease in / at 1 M NaCl indicates a decrease in 6 , owing to enhanced charge screening which compacts the disordered protein.",

The search region in the protein channel was three times the standard deviation of the Gaussian fit to the point spread function of our microscope. We estimated vesicle diameters from lipid fluorescence brightnesses by calibrating against dynamic light scattering, as described in the previous section. We estimated the number of bound proteins on each vesicle by comparing brightness values in the protein channel to the brightness of a single molecule of Atto 594-labeled protein. Images of single molecules of Atto 594-labeled proteins were obtained by adding a dilute concentration of protein to an imaging well on an ultraclean coverslip, and imaging single proteins adhered to the coverslip surface in a similar manner as described for the tethered vesicles. A linear correction for camera exposure time was applied to the single molecule brightness, as longer exposure times were required to image single molecules compared to membranebound protein. Fig. S2B shows a plot of the raw protein intensity values as a function of vesicle intensity for 10 and 25 nM Amph-FL.

At concentrations above 25 nM, Amph-FL significantly deformed and tubulated 200 nm tethered vesicles, leading to inaccuracies in coverage estimates. Therefore, to obtain estimates of membrane coverage by Amph-FL at higher concentrations at which potent fission occurs, we used higher initial curvature vesicles, extruded to 30 nm. Fig. S2F plots membrane coverage by Amph-FL at 25 and 100 nM on 30 nm vesicles, showing that Amph-FL reached approximately 77% membrane coverage at 100 nM, significantly higher than can be reached by protein monomers that do not assemble (Feder, 1980) .

TagBFP was amplified from the li-Str_ManII-SBP-tagBFP plasmid using PCR primers which introduced AgeI and XhoI restriction sites. The resulting tagBFP sequence was digested and ligated onto the CLC backbone to generate BFP-CLC with a linker sequence of HKGRPTR. The CLC-BFP construct was then excised using AgeI and EcoRI restriction sites and ligated into a pLJM1 backbone obtained from Addgene as a gift from Dr. David Sabatini (Addgene #19319). Once subcloned into this viral transfer plasmid, lentiviruses were generated by transfecting the BFP-CLC construct with the envelope plasmid VSVG (a gift from Dr. Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, Addgene #11912) and packaging plasmid pCMV-dR8.91 (a gift from Dr. Janet Zoldan).

The objective was heated to 37 \u00b0C using a Pecon TempController 2000-2 objective heater.

Only movies of cells with similar expression level, acquired under identical imaging settings, were used for analysis. For the tube lifetime analysis in Fig. 4F , only tubes which appeared within the time course of imaging and departed before the end of the time course were included. For the tube intensity analysis, a single frame in the movie with the maximum number of tubes was selected, and the average tube intensity was measured along a straight line drawn on the tube. The mean intensity along an identical line on either side of the tube was also measured, and these values were averaged to estimate the local background intensity of the tube.

Because Amph-FL occupies a greater area on the membrane surface compared to N-BAR (79 versus 16.5 nm 2 per monomer, respectively), Amph-FL reaches a higher coverage than N-BAR at equal number density of membranebound proteins. At 25 nM, Amph-FL reaches approximately 20% membrane coverage, approaching a crowded regime (Snead et al., 2017; Stachowiak et al., 2012) . Markers in (D) and (E) represent mean \u00b1 first s.d., n = 3 independent experiments. (F) Membrane coverage estimates for 25 and 100 nM Amph-FL on 30 nm vesicles. At 100 nM Amph-FL, when potent membrane fission occurs, Amph-FL reaches approximately 77% membrane coverage, significantly higher than can be reached by non-assembling proteins. At this coverage, steric pressure from disordered domain crowding is very high, providing a potential explanation for strong membrane fission by Amph-FL. Markers indicate mean of all coverage values, error bars represent 95% confidence interval. 25 nM: n = 2,171 vesicles, 100 nM: n = 1,783 vesicles.

Average values of diffusion time, t D , \u00b1 first s.d. are shown next to each trace, with n = 10, 5, and 3 FCS traces for Amph CTD \u2206SH3, AP180 CTD, and transferrin, respectively. The hydrodynamic radius, 6 , of each protein is also shown next to each trace. 6 of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 was computed by scaling from the known 6 of AP180 CTD (see methods). Using this same approach yields an 6 of transferrin that is similar to its expected value (Hall et al., 2002) . (J) Relative diffusion times of Amph CTD \u2206SH3 in buffer with 10, 150, and 1,000 mM sodium chloride (NaCl), expressed as the proportion of the average diffusion time at 150 mM NaCl. The data indicate a transition from an extended to a more compact state with increasing ionic strength, as expected for charged disordered proteins (Srinivasan et al., 2014) . Diffusion times were corrected for changes in solution viscosity with varying NaCl concentration (Zhang and Han, 1996) .
