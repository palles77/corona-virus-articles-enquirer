The mean reduction in exacerbation rate of 34 patients who received IFN-B (recipients) was significantly greater during the study than that of 35 patients who received placebo (p <0.04). The prestudy exacerbation rates were comparable in recipients and controls, but the rate at the end of the study was significantly lower in recipients than in controls (p <0.001). IFN-B was given by nine or ten lumbar punctures over the first 6 months of the study, and patient observations continued for 2 years. IFN-B was well tolerated in 95% of the recipients, and the side-effects experienced were clearly acceptable for the benefits achieved. Low doses of indomethacin reduced the toxicity of IFN-B and played an important role in successful doubleblinding.",

The prestudy duration of illness was at least 1 year in all but 2 patients (5 months, 10 months), who were included because they clearly had MS (recently revised criteria23) with high exacerbation rates. Each patient underwent a complete neurological examination at the beginning of the study, and the severity of symptoms and signs was scored according to a modified Kurtzke method.\"-24 The prestudy exacerbation rate was determined by dividing the total number of exacerbations (standard definitionz&deg;-z3) recorded before the study by the duration of disease up to the time of randomisation. In the 2 patients who had had MS for less than a year, the number of exacerbations recorded before the study was considered as the number that would have occurred in a full year (ie, we did not adjust their rates upward to compensate for their shorter disease durations). Patients were then randomly assigned (biased coin) to the recipient or control group by means of stratification based on prestudy exacerbation rate (ie, less than two exacerbations/year; two or more exacerbations/year). The randomisation yielded recipient and control populations with similar mean prestudy exacerbation rates (recipients 1 79, controls 1-98 per year). There were no meaningful differences in other clinical parameters between the two groups (eg, age, sex, prestudy disease duration, disability status, and functional group scores).",

Such treatment may limit the severity of symptoms and signs of exacerbations but does not prevent their recurrence. 21 Exacerbation rates during the study were calculated from the number of exacerbations occurring during the study and the time on the study. A one-tailed t statistic was used to test the effect of treatment on changes in exacerbation rate. The statistical plan, based on data from our preliminary study was designed to detect a true difference in exacerbation-rate reductions between recipients and controls of 0-65 exacerbations per year at a type I error level of 0-05 with a power of 0,80.19",

The maximum pleocytosis (mean 1-22x10/1, range 0-12-5-66 x 10$/1) and rise in protein (mean 590 mg/1, range 240-1600 mg/1) were noted during the first 5 weeks of treatment. At the last treatment (6 months), mean pleocytosis was 0-25 x 108/1 (range 0-02-1-88 x 10$/1) and mean CSF protein 460 mgjl (range 150-1600 mg/1). At 2 years, mean pleocytosis was 0-16 x 108/1 (range 0-01-0-61 x 108/1) and the mean CSF protein was 460 mg/1 (range 150-1600 mg/1).",

            "text": "It is known that the exacerbation rates of MS patients may fall over time as a natural phenomenon. However, studies of the changes in exacerbation rates of 393 MS patients26 show that, when our patients entered the study (illness duration 5-4 years in recipients, 6-1 years in controls) no decrease in rate would have been expected in either group during the study as a natural phenomenon. Therefore, we attribute most of the 57% reduction in exacerbation rate in recipients to the IFN-B treatment. We also attribute the uncoupling of dependence of the rate during the study on the prestudy rate observed in recipients (but not controls) to IFN-B treatment. The 26% reduction in exacerbation rate observed in the controls during the study might have been due to a placebo effect. We will continue our follow-up of the patients in this study. In our preliminary study the IFN-B prophylactic effect against exacerbations persisted for 4-4&mdash;5-3 years without retreatment.43-45 We emphasise that our treatment schedule may not be the optimum one. In the preliminary study, patients underwent thirteen treatments in 6 months; the number was reduced to nine in this study, and both regimens significantly reduced exacerbation rates. It is possible that even fewer treatments at different intervals might provide similar degrees of prophylaxis.",

Interferon is a mediator of T-lymphocyte suppression; the treatment may have stabilised the fluctuations in suppressor T-cell activity known to occur during the course of MS, which have been postulated to be an integral part of the exacerbation/remission cycle.8'-31 Alternatively, IFN-B may have changed the viral trigger for repeated exacerbations through clearance of a persistent CNS viral infection, possibly by inducing HLA-marker expression on the surface of infected cells, thus exposing them to the immune system.32-34 Such clearance could result in a transient increase in immunopathology and clinical exacerbation in some cases;35-37 however, we could not statistically document an increase in exacerbations in our recipients during the treatment phase. IFN injected intrathecally does not pool in the lumbar sac, but flows upward over the surface of the cerebral convexities and comes into direct contact with brain parenchyma.38,39 While the mechanisms of its actions remain unknown, three studies have,clearly shown that IFN-B acts in a prophylactic and suppressant way on the expression of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. 40-42 The IFN-B was most effective at the lowest doses when it was administered directly into the CSF.42 ..",
