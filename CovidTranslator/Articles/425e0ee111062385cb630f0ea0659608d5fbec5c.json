            "text": "Viruses and bacteria contribute to the pathogenesis and natural history of childhood asthma. 1 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) predominates in infants and toddlers, while human rhinovirus (hRV), influenza (Flu) viruses, parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (AdV), coronavirus (CoV), and human enterovirus (hEV) are more prevalent in older children. 2 It is common for children with asthma to develop respiratory symptoms, especially during winter. Many of their clinical findings, however, result from respiratory infections that require supportive care and minimizing exposure to respiratory pathogens. 3, 4 The prevailing practice, nevertheless, is escalating the use of short-acting \u03b2-agonists (SABAs), long-acting \u03b2-agonists (LABAs), inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs), and leukotriene receptor antagonist. These medications are expensive and may impose serious adverse events, especially in young children. 5 Therefore, identifying and controlling triggers of asthma deserve further studies.",

However, few studies have addressed respiratory viral infections at community level. For example, in Saudi Arabia, most cases of RSV occur from November through March and some cases have been reported at other months of the year. 6 In Kuwait, a study that has investigated the causative agents in >1,000 patients with lower respiratory tract infections using PCR revealed that RSV and hRV are the major isolates among hospitalized children from October to March. PIV-2 and human CoV were not detected in any of the patients' samples. 7 Regular surveillance, especially during the winter is necessary if pathogens are to be identified with a view to possible prevention. This prospective, case-control pilot study aimed to estimate the prevalence of nasopharyngeal isolates in children with asthma during winter season and identify their clinical impact on respiratory symptoms and function. Its main objective was to address the importance of controlling respiratory pathogens in the treatment of childhood asthma.",

Demographic, medical, and vaccination data were reviewed. History of asthma symptoms was obtained using a modified global asthma network questionnaire. 9 For the assessment of symptoms of viral infection, we used a validated Common Cold Questionnaire (CCQ). 10 This questionnaire inquired about the presence of fever, chills, muscle pain, watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough, and chest pain during 2 days prior to specimen collection; each complaint was scored as none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). The GINA assessment of asthma control was used to assess the level of asthma control over the past 4 weeks. 8 This instrument scored the presence (1) or absence (0) of each of the 4 clinical variables, day symptoms, night symptoms, reliever use, and exercise limitation. A score of zero indicated well-controlled asthma, 1-2 partly-controlled asthma, and 3-4 uncontrolled asthma.",

Airway microbiome studies have shown that bacteria may play a substantial role in the onset, evolution, and severity of asthma. 13 This study was conducted to test the hypothesis that nasopharyngeal colonizations with community-acquired pathogens have an adverse impact on the natural history of asthma in young children. The results show that the majority of patients with asthma had several viral pathogens, which contributed to symptoms and airway resistance (Tables 1 and  2 ). The clinical impact of the respiratory pathogens on asthma control is shown in Table 1 . Patients 2 and 3 had increased CCQ scores in association with colonizations with HI and BP on the second sampling. The increased airway resistance in Patient 5 on the second sample collection could be due to colonization with HI or adverse events of prior AdV. Similarly, the increased airway resistance in Patient 8 could be due to prior CoV OC43. The high airway resistance in Patient 14 could be due to PIV-3. As the course and severity of asthma are also related to the role of many environmental factors (such as air pollution, humidity, and smoking), medication adherence, and poor inhaler technique, it is not totally unexpected that the role of respiratory pathogens cannot be considered in isolation and cannot be solely responsible for asthma control. With respect to the controls (Table 3) , Children 1 and 6 both had high airway resistance associated with multiple colonizations. Child 1 was found subsequently to have symptoms of allergic rhinitis and mild night cough.",

Future studies are needed to address important variables relevant to this organism, such as serotypes (especially HRV-16), upper vs lower respiratory colonization, and host susceptibility (eg, variability in expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1). 2 Airway inflammation has been reported in infections with Flu viruses, which are well known to induce severe exacerbation in adults. 4 M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, on the other hand, seem to be involved in asthma persistence. 1, 4 The atypical bacteria C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae were not detected in our studied population. These pathogens may be more important in adults with chronic asthma. Similarly, RSV and MPV were not detected in the patients.

In addition, the role of other environmental factors (such as air pollution, humidity, and smoking), medication adherence, and poor inhaler technique has to be taken into consideration in future studies.",
