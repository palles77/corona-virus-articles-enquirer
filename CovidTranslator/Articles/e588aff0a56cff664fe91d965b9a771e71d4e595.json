            "text": "Background: Different linguo-cultural communities might react to an outbreak differently. The 2015 South Korean MERS outbreak presented an opportunity for us to compare tweets responding to the same outbreak in different languages. Methods: We obtained a 1% sample through Twitter streaming application programming interface from June 1 to 30, 2015. We identified MERS-related tweets with keywords such as 'MERS' and its translation in five different languages. We translated non-English tweets into English for statistical comparison. Results: We retrieved MERS-related Twitter data in five languages: Korean (N Z 21,823), English (N Z 4024), Thai (N Z 2084), Japanese (N Z 1334) and Indonesian (N Z 1256). Categories of randomly selected user profiles (p < 0.001) and the top 30 sources of retweets (p < 0.001) differed between the five language corpora. Among the randomly selected user profiles, K-pop fans ranged from 4% in the Korean corpus to 70% in the Thai corpus; media ranged from 0% (Thai) to 14% (Indonesian); political advocates ranged from 0% (Thai) to 19% (Japanese); medical professionals ranged from 0% (Thai) to 7% (English). Among the top 30 sources of retweets for each corpus (150 in total), 70 (46.7%) were media; 29 (19.3%) were K-pop fans; 7 (4.7%) were political; 9 (6%) were medical; and 35 (23.3%) were categorized as 'Others'. We performed chi-square feature selection and identified the top 20 keywords that were most unique to each corpus. Conclusion: Different linguo-cultural communities exist on Twitter and they might react to the same outbreak differently. Understanding audiences' unique Twitter cultures will allow public health agencies to develop appropriate Twitter health communication strategies. \u00aa 2017 Australasian College for Infection Prevention and Control.

            "text": "Twitter corpora in different languages provide us with an opportunity to analyze the perception of and reaction to disease outbreaks among different populations. Twitter is a social media platform that allows users to communicate in different languages. According to Statistica, there were 328 million monthly active Twitter users worldwide in 2017 [3] ; two-thirds of Twitter accounts were outside the US [4] ; and Twitter supported 35 or more languages [5] . The transnational nature of Twitter as a social media platform where users of different linguo-cultural backgrounds can react to the same event online in real time presents us with an opportunity in which we can examine some of the hidden assumptions of social media public health literature. Many analyses of Twitter data in public health literature only studied tweets written in English. For example, a recent systematic review on social media studies about Ebola found that all seven studies on Twitter data about Ebola covered English tweets only [6] . In a recent paper on Twitter data about Zika, while the authors studied the trends of Zika-related tweets in English, Spanish and Portuguese, respectively, they limited their content analysis to English language tweets given their own language limitation [7] . However, health-related English language Twitter content may not be generalizable to Twitter content in other languages. The assumed 'global' nature of Twitter and the analysis of a monolingual corpus of Twitter data mask the underlying diverse nature of the different linguocultural groups of users who communicate on Twitter using different languages [8] . We contend that it is essentially an Anglophone-centric paradigm with a hidden language bias towards English [9] .",

Another feature of the Japanese corpus is the anti-Korean sentiment. The feature selection result of Thai tweets reveals that there were a few K-pop related posts, which can be informed by the keyword 'fan' and 'EXO'. Because there was a MERS case in Thailand (confirmed on June 17, 2015) [16] , we also observed keywords 'withstand', 'tissue', and 'cough,' which all appeared in educational posts that educated the public about MERS virus.
