            "text": "Reverse genetics, an approach to rescue infectious virus entirely from a cloned cDNA, has revolutionized the field of positive-strand RNA viruses, whose genomes have the same polarity as cellular mRNA. The cDNA-based reverse genetics system is a seminal method that enables direct manipulation of the viral genomic RNA, thereby generating recombinant viruses for molecular and genetic studies of both viral RNA elements and gene products in viral replication and pathogenesis. It also provides a valuable platform that allows the development of genetically defined vaccines and viral vectors for the delivery of foreign genes. For many positive-strand RNA viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), however, the cloned cDNAs are unstable, posing a major obstacle to the construction and propagation of the functional cDNA. Here, the present report describes the strategic considerations in creating and amplifying a genetically stable full-length infectious JEV cDNA as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) using the following general experimental procedures: viral RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, cDNA subcloning and modification, assembly of a full-length cDNA, cDNA linearization, in vitro RNA synthesis, and virus recovery. This protocol provides a general methodology applicable to cloning full-length cDNA for a range of positive-strand RNA viruses, particularly those with a genome of >10 kb in length, into a BAC vector, from which infectious RNAs can be transcribed in vitro with a bacteriophage RNA polymerase.",

            "text": "For RNA virologists, the advent of recombinant DNA technology in the late 1970s made it possible to convert viral RNA genomes into cDNA clones, which could then be propagated as plasmids in bacteria for the genetic manipulation of RNA viruses. 1 The first RNA virus to be molecularly cloned was bacteriophage Q\u03b2, a positive-strand RNA virus that infects Escherichia coli. A plasmid containing a complete cDNA copy of the Q\u03b2 genomic RNA gave rise to infectious Q\u03b2 phages when introduced into E. coli. 2 Shortly thereafter, this technique was applied to poliovirus, a positive-strand RNA virus of humans and animals. A plasmid bearing a full-length cDNA of the poliovirus genomic RNA was infectious when transfected into mammalian cells and capable of producing infectious virions. 3 In this \"DNA-launched\" approach, the cloned cDNAs should be transcribed intracellularly to initiate viral RNA replication; however, it is unclear how the transcription is initiated and how the transcripts are processed to the correct viral sequence. This concern has led to the development of an alternative \"RNA-launched\" approach, whereby a complete cDNA copy of the viral RNA genome is cloned under a promoter recognized by an E. coli or phage RNA polymerase for the production of synthetic RNAs in vitro with defined 5' and 3' termini, which undergo the complete viral replication cycle when introduced into host cells. 4, 5 The first success with this approach was reported for brome mosaic virus, 6 ,7 a positive-strand RNA virus of plants. Since then, the RNA-launched approach has been developed for a wide range of positive-strand RNA viruses, including caliciviruses, alphaviruses, flaviviruses, arteriviruses, and coronaviruses. 1, 4, 5, 8 In both the DNA-and RNA-launched reverse genetics systems, the construction of a full-length cDNA clone is the key to generating infectious DNA or RNA of positive-strand RNA viruses, but it becomes a considerable technical challenge as the size of the viral genome increases. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] In particular, a large RNA genome of ~10-32 kb presents three major obstacles to the cloning of a full-length functional cDNA. 18 The first difficulty is the synthesis of a faithful cDNA copy, since the fidelity of RT-PCR is inversely proportional to the length of the viral RNA. The second hurdle is the presence of potentially toxic sequences, since long RNA molecules are more likely to contain unexpected sequences capable of making the cDNA fragment in plasmids unstable in E. coli. The third and most critical issue is the availability of a suitable vector, since it is difficult to find a cloning vector that can house a viral cDNA insert of >10 kb. Over the past three decades, these barriers have been overcome by several advances in enzymology, methodology, and vectorology. 1, 4, 5, 8 Of these, the most promising and innovative development is the cloning of large positive-strand RNA viruses as infectious bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs). The BAC vector is a low-copy cloning plasmid (1-2 copies/cell) based on the E. coli fertility factor, with an average DNA insert size of ~120-350 kb. 19 2. Assemble a set of the four modified, overlapping cDNAs into a single full-length SA 14 -14-2 BAC (pBAC/SA 14 -14-2) by joining at three natural restriction sites (BsrG I, BamH I, and Ava I) in a sequential manner using the five-step cloning procedures detailed in Protocols 3.1-3.5 ( Figure 1E) ) in a 6-well plate. 7. After 4-6 hr of incubation, overlay the cells with 0.5% agarose in minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Incubate the plates for 4 days at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . 8. Visualize the infectious centers (plaques) by fixation with 7% formaldehyde and staining with 1% crystal violet in 5% ethanol 27 (Figure 6A ). ",

Figure 2 provides a representative result for the four RT-PCR products that were electrophoresed on a 0.8% agarose gel. This gel demonstrates clearly that a full-length JEV cDNA is amplified into four overlapping cDNA fragments. Occasionally, RT-PCR reactions might yield one or more additional virus-specific or nonspecific products that are mostly smaller than the expected product, because of the nonspecific annealing of primers during cDNA synthesis/amplification. On the other hand, little or no expected RT-PCR product would be amplified because of accidental RNase contamination during the viral RNA isolation or improper RT-PCR performance.",

After incubation for 4 days, surviving cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with a crystal violet solution to quantify the number of infectious centers (plaques), which corresponds to the number of infectious RNA molecules delivered into the cells (Figure 6A ). Since the cDNA template used for in vitro transcription has been proven to be non-infectious, 27 an aliquot of the transcription reaction mixture was directly used for electroporation. Electroporation is the preferred method for RNA transfection; alternatively, RNAs can be transfected by other methods using DEAE-dextran and cationic liposomes. RNA electroporation is very effective, but \"arcing\" of the electric pulse occurs rarely if salts are present in the electroporation reaction or if the electroporation cuvette is reused.

            "text": "The current protocol has been successfully used to generate full-length infectious cDNA clones for two different strains (CNU/LP2 27 and SA 14 -14-2 28 ) of JEV, a flavivirus whose functional cDNA has proved to be inherently difficult to construct and propagate because of host cell toxicity and the genetic instability of the cloned cDNA. 8, [74] [75] [76] This protocol involves three major components: first, maximizing the synthesis/ amplification of a faithful cDNA copy of the viral RNA using high-fidelity reverse transcriptase/DNA polymerase; second, cloning the viral prM-E coding region containing toxic sequences (unpublished data) 74, 77, 78 in a very low-copy number vector BAC from the initial cDNA subcloning to the final full-length cDNA assembly steps; and third, utilizing a cloning vector BAC that can accommodate a foreign DNA with an average size of 120-350 kb, [19] [20] [21] which apparently tolerates larger DNA inserts than do other cloning vectors. This cloning approach will be generally applicable to many other positive-strand RNA viruses, particularly those with a large RNA genome of ~10 to 32 kb. Generation of an infectious cDNA clone is a key step in developing a reverse genetics system for RNA viruses, especially for positive-strand RNA viruses, because its genome acts as viral mRNA that is translated into proteins by host cell ribosomes. Thus, viral replication can be initiated by the introduction of a cDNA-derived genome-length RNA molecule into a susceptible host cell. The availability of an infectious JEV cDNA clone, when combined with recombinant DNA technology, has increased our understanding of various aspects of the viral life cycle at the molecular level, such as gene expression 73, 79 and genome replication. 63, 64 Also, a full-length JEV cDNA clone has proven to be a valuable tool for the development of antiviral vaccines 28 and gene delivery vectors. 80, 81 As with all positive-strand RNA viruses, there are multiple critical steps in constructing a reliable functional cDNA for JEV from which highly infectious RNAs can be synthesized in vitro. Ideally, the sequence of the synthetic RNAs transcribed from a clone of the full-length cDNA should be identical to that of the viral genomic RNA, particularly the 5'-and 3'-terminal sequences that are required for the initiation of viral RNA replication. [60] [61] [62] In the current protocol, the authentic 5'-and 3'-ends were ensured by placing the SP6 promoter sequence upstream of the first adenine nucleotide of the viral genome and positioning a unique artificial Xba I restriction site downstream of the last thymine nucleotide of the viral genome, respectively. Capped synthetic RNAs with the authentic 5' and 3' ends were produced by run-off transcription of an Xba I-linearized and MBN-treated cDNA template using SP6 RNA polymerase primed with the m 7 G(5')ppp(5')A cap analog. This protocol can be modified in several ways. For in vitro transcription, another bacteriophage RNA polymerase (e.g., T3 or T7) can be used in conjunction with its well-defined promoter sequence. 27 As a run-off site, a different restriction site can be utilized if it is not present in the viral genome and if synthetic RNA from the linearized cDNA ends with the authentic 3' end. The importance of the 3'-end nucleotide sequence has been demonstrated by a ~10-fold decrease in RNA infectivity when a synthetic RNA contains three or four virus-unrelated nucleotides at its 3' end. 27 In an in vitro transcription reaction, both the m 7 G(5')ppp(5')A and m 7 G(5')ppp(5')G cap analog can be used equally well, although the latter places an unrelated extra G nucleotide upstream of the viral 5'-end, but that addition does not alter the infectivity or replication of synthetic RNA. 27 Moreover, removal of the cDNA template from the RNA transcripts by DNase I digestion is not necessary for RNA infectivity tests, because the cDNA template itself is not infectious. 27 The BAC technology has now been applied to constructing infectious cDNA clones for a handful of positive-strand RNA viruses, namely, two JEVs, CNU/LP2 27 and SA 14 -14-2 28 (genome size, ~11 kb); two dengue viruses, BR/90 26 and NGC 29 (~11 kb); the bovine viral diarrhea construction is the high genetic stability of the large, 1-or 2-copy BAC plasmids; however, the intrinsic nature of its extremely low-copy number is also a great disadvantage, because of very low yields of BAC DNA and the consequent reduction in the purity of the BAC DNA with respect to host chromosomal DNA. In the current protocol, the yield of BAC DNA is maximized by growing E. coli DH10B transformed with the infectious BAC pBAC/SA 14 -14-2 in a nutrient-rich medium, 2xYT. Despite this effort, the average yield is only ~15 \u00b5g of BAC DNA from 500 ml of 2xYT broth. Also, the purity of the BAC DNA is best achieved by using CsCl-EtBr density gradient centrifugation for purification, rather than the commonly used column-based plasmid isolation. However, it is important to keep in mind that the BAC-transformed E. coli should not overgrow because it might jeopardize the genetic stability of the cloned cDNA, and higher growth does not necessarily lead to greater yields or higherpurity BAC DNA.",

This same cloning strategy may also be applied to many other positive-strand RNA viruses. In general, infectious cDNA clones enable us to introduce a variety of mutations (e.g., deletions, insertions, and point mutations) into a viral RNA genome to study their biological functions in viral replication and pathogenesis. This cDNAbased reverse genetics system makes it possible to develop and test vaccine and therapeutic candidates targeting a virulence factor(s) of a particular positive-strand RNA virus of interest. In addition, this infectious cDNA technology can also be utilized as a viral vector, capable of expressing a foreign gene(s) of interest for many applications in biomedical research.",
