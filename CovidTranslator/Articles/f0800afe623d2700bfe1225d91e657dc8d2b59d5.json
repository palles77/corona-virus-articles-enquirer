Since first reported in Hong Kong in 2012, PDCoV has been subsequently detected in USA, South Korea, Thailand, and mainland China. Here we isolated a strain of PDCoV, named CHN-GD-2016, from the intestinal content of a diseased newborn piglet with severe diarrhea in a pig farm in Guangdong, China. PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 could be identified by immunofluorescence with PDCoV specific rabbit antisera, and typical crown-shaped particles with spiky surface projections of this PDCoV were observed with electron microscopy. Genomic analysis showed that the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 was closely related to other Chinese PDCoV strains, with the highest sequence similarity with the strain CHN/Tianjin/2016. Importantly, inoculation of newborn piglets with 1 9 10 5 TCID 50 of CHN-GD-2016 by oral feeding successfully reproduced clear clinical symptoms, including vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhea in piglets. In addition, the virus RNA in rectal swabs from 1 to 7 days post inoculation was detected, macroscopic and microscopic lesions in small intestine were observed, and viral antigen was also detected in the small intestines with immunohistochemical staining. Collectively, the data show in this study confirms that PDCoV is present in Guangdong, China and is highly pathogenic in newborn piglets.",

Porcine CoVs are significant enteric and respiratory pathogens of swine. Five porcine CoVs have so far been identified: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Doyle and Hutchings 1946) , porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (Wesley et al. 1990) , and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Pensaert and De Bouck 1978) in the Alphacoronavirus genus; porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV) (Sasseville et al. 2002) in the Betacoronavirus genus; and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) (Woo et al. 2012) in the Deltacoronavirus genus. PDCoV was first detected in 2012 in Hong Kong during a molecular epidemiology study of CoVs using RT-PCR to examine the pig samples and complete genome sequences of these two PDCoV strains were reported (Woo et al. 2012) . PDCoV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of appropriately 25 kb in length (Zhang 2016) . The genome organization of PDCoV are in the order of: 5 0 untranslated region (UTR), open reading frame 1a/1b (ORF1a/1b), spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nonstructural protein 6 (NS6), nucleocapsid (N), nonstructural protein 7 (NS7), and 3 0 UTR (Chen et al. 2015a, b) . The clinical symptoms in newborn piglets caused by PDCoV infection are similar to that by other porcine enteric pathogens such as PEDV and TGEV, which includes vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration and death (Zhang 2016) . To date, there are no effective treatments or vaccines for PDCoV.",

These molecular surveillance studies indicated that PDCoV was a common viral pathogen of pigs around the world. Increasing virological and serological methods have been developed to detect PDCoV in clinical samples from pig farms. Virological methods include detection of virus particles by electron microscopy (Ma et al. 2015) , detection of viral nucleic acid by RT-PCR and real-time PCR (Marthaler et al. 2014; Hu et al. 2015a, b) . And the most commonly used serological assays for PDCoV are indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) assay (Dong et al. 2016 ) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting PDCoV nucleocapsid (N) protein (Su et al. 2016) .",

Consistent with the histopathological results, the PDCoV antigen in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes of the PDCoV-challenged piglets was detected by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 6E ), but no PDCoV antigen was detected in negative control (Fig. 6F) .

            "text": "Since the first report of PDCoV in pigs in 2012 in Hong Kong (Woo et al. 2012) , this novel swine enteric coronavirus has been widely detected and isolated in pig farms in different countries (Lee and Lee 2014; Marthaler et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2014a Wang et al. , b, 2015 Saeng-Chuto et al. 2017) . The prevalence of PDCoV in pigs in mainland China was reported to be 23.4% in three provinces in China (Chen et al. 2015a, b) , and Song et al. reported a PDCoV positive rate of 33.71% in Jiangxi province, China (Song et al. 2015) . Our result showed a PDCoV positive rate of 16.7% in 7 diarrhea-outbreak pig farms in Guangdong, China. In addition, there were higher detection rates of PEDV (45.8%) than of TGEV (0%) or PRoV (0%) in those pig farms. Notably, all two PDCoV-positive piglets were co-infected with PEDV. Although the prevalence of PDCoV in southern China was reported (Zhai et al. 2016) , there are no published papers reporting the successful isolation of PDCoV in Guangdong, China. In the present study, we reported that an isolate from a case of piglet diarrhea in Guangdong, was highly pathogenic to newborn piglets. This PDCoV strain can be further used for virological and serological assay development, and vaccine development. LLC-PK, a stable epithelial-like pig kidney cell line (Hull et al. 1976) , is commonly used to isolate PDCoV (Hu et al. 2015a. b; Dong et al. 2016 ). In addition, ST cell line is also used to isolate PDCoV (Hu et al. 2015a, b) . Since the intestinal content samples were confirmed as PDCoVpositive, we attempted to isolate virus from these samples in LLC-PK cells. However, only the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain was successfully isolated in LLC-PK cells. The difficulty to isolate PDCoV from positive samples might be associated with the fact that positive RT-PCR samples may contain noninfectious or low amount of virus (Hu et al. 2015a, b) . And the amount of trypsin in LLC-PK cells might also contribute to successful PDCoV isolation. CPE was firstly observed in inoculated LLC-PK cells at day 6 p.i.. After plaque purification and several passages, the viral titer reached 1 9 10 9 TCID 50 /mL, showing that the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain was highly replicative in LLC-PK cells. The plaque-purified PDCoV strain in LLC-PK cells was further confirmed by IFA with PDCoV specific rabbit antisera, indicating that we successfully isolated a PDCoV strain in Guangdong. We also observed characteristic crown-like particles of the purified PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain by electron microscopy. Despite the successful isolation of one strain, the success rate was relatively low. As a result, further attempts are needed to improve the situation. The attempts might include inoculation of sensitive piglets by fresh homogenate to increase the virus titers for isolation, which are proved to be feasible in PEDV isolation .",

Based on the phylogenetic tree analysis, all PDCoV strains from GenBank share high nucleotide identities. Notably, the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain can be clustered into one clade with other isolates from mainland China, indicating that PDCoV strains currently circulating in multiple Chinese provinces are closely related. The PDCoV strains isolated in mainland China belong to an independent subcluster. Obviously, further studies are needed to identify the exact origin of the mainland China PDCoVs. Previous studies have shown that the S gene, the most variable region in the coronavirus genomes, belongs to type I membrane glycoproteins family (Woo et al. 2010) and that the S protein of CoVs are involved in receptor binding and viral entry (Woo et al. 2010) . Sequencing of S genes revealed characteristic 3 nucleotide deletion, which is also present in most PDCoV strains from mainland China like CHN-HN-2014 strain (Dong et al. 2016 ), compared with the HKU15 strains. However, whether these unique variations contribute to the efficiency of viral replication and virulence needs to be further investigated.",

            "text": "Of note, several groups have confirmed the pathogenicity of PDCoV strains in gnotobiotic or conventional pigs (Chen et al. 2015a, b; Jung et al. 2015; Ma et al. 2015; Dong et al. 2016) . Collectively, these results confirmed that PDCoV cause severe diarrhea and vomiting in pigs of 5-21 days old. We hypothesized that the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain was also capable of causing the same clinical symptoms in piglets. We infected the 5-day-old newborn piglets with the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain via oral feeding. Our success in reproduction of severe diarrhea and vomiting in piglets by oral infection strongly suggested that PDCoV posed a huge threat to the newborn piglets in pig farms. Furthermore, we collected fecal swabs from the PDCoV-challenged piglets and detected the viral fecal shedding with real-time PCR. PDCoV RNA was detected from day 1 p.i. to day 7 p.i., while no RNA was detected in the negative control piglets during the study, indicating that the infection with PDCoV by fecal-oral contamination might be the major mode of transmission for diarrhea in piglets in pig farms. In addition, gross lesions were obviously observed in the small intestines of the 5-day-old piglets at necropsy at day 7 p.i., similar to observations in other studies (Chen et al. 2015a, b; Jung et al. 2015; Ma et al. 2015; Dong et al. 2016) . While microscopic lesions were observed in all sections of small intestine infected by PEDV in previous report (Madson et al. 2014) , we only observed microscopic lesions in the jejunum and ileum in CHN-GD-2016 infected piglets, indicating that disease caused by PDCoV was milder than that caused by PEDV. In addition, the PDCoV antigen in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes of the PDCoV-challenged piglets was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. Together, all these results confirmed that the PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 strain isolated in this study could cause enteric diseases in newborn piglets. However, there are still several important questions needed to be addressed. For example, what is the relationship between this virus and PEDV, the causative agent for severe diarrhea in pigs? And what is the role of the nucleotide changes of S gene on viral replication and virulence? How to prepare effective vaccine against the PDCoV? Elucidation of these questions will elevate our understandings of the pathogenicity of PDCoV infection and may help to develop better strategies to control PDCoV. In summary, we isolated a field strain of PDCoV from the intestinal content of a severe diarrheic piglet in Guangdong, China. Furthermore, genomic analysis showed that the isolate was closely related to other Chinese PDCoV strains, with the highest sequence similarity with the strain CHN/Tianjin/2016. Importantly, inoculation of newborn piglets with PDCoV CHN-GD-2016 by oral feeding successfully reproduced clear clinical symptoms, including vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhea in piglets. Collectively, these findings suggested that PDCoV was present in Guangdong, China and is highly virulent in piglets. Therefore, the development of potential vaccines against emerging PDCoV strains is urgently required.",
