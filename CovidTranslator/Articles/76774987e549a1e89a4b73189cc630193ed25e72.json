It has high accuracy, sensitivity and wide dynamic range in addition to medium-to high-throughput capabilities. These features make MS a superior platform for analysis of various biomolecules including proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and carbohydrates. Until recently, MS was applied for protein detection and characterization. During the last decade, however, MS has successfully been used for molecular diagnostics of microbial and viral infections with the most notable applications being identification of pathogens, genomic sequencing, mutation detection, DNA methylation analysis, tracking of transmissions, and characterization of genetic heterogeneity. These new developments vastly expand the MS application from experimental research to public health and clinical fields. Matching of molecular techniques with specific requirements of the major MS platforms has produced powerful technologies for molecular diagnostics, which will further benefit from coupling with computational tools for extracting clinical information from MS-derived data.",

Sub-picomolar amounts of the analyte can be detected without fluorescence or radioactive isotope labeling or using antibodies or hybridization probes. It can be used to detect the material of interest directly [11] or after attaching an intermediate detector molecule, thus conferring high sensitivity to detection [12] . Direct detection significantly simplifies the MS diagnostic applications [10, 13] . As a detection system for NAs, MS can be easily coupled with any widely available DNA amplification technique. These qualities, combined with the capability of multiplexing -that is, testing for different analytes at the same time -make MS particularly suitable for rapid molecular diagnostics in the clinical setting. MS is uniquely suited for supporting multiple diverse applications. The throughput and multiplexing capacity of MS help reduce the cost of testing.",

This results in the emission of aerosols of charged droplets of the sample. The aerosol travels through sections of decreasing pressure, which leads to formation of gas-phase ions of the analyte. ESI is typically coupled with an automated autosampler in a well-plate format, injector and liquid chromatography, which controls the flow rate of sample delivery and buffers the zones between samples. The rate of sample detection is several minutes per sample. The analyzer/detector can be FTICR, which detects all generated ions simultaneously and differentiates them by their rotational frequency, which is then transformed into a specific mass reading or a micro-TOF. The FTICR detection has great accuracy and high resolution [15] . A schematic representation of the ESI-MS is shown in Figure 1 .",

            "text": "There are two major classes of matrix, 'hot' and 'cool,' for desorbing laser energy that can be used in MALDI-TOF MS. The hot matrices have higher desorption/ionization energy, which results in excessive fragmentation of the analytes, and thus are more suitable for detection of small RNA molecules. Cool matrices are used for larger oligonucleotides and cause little fragmentation. Commonly used matrices for RNA are a mix of 2,3,4-and 2,4,6trihydroxyacetophenone, and matrices for DNA are \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic, 2,5dihydroxybenzoic or 3-hydroxypicolinic acid [7] . The matrix is crystallized on a solid inert surface. The sample is then imbedded in the matrix by dispensing in nanoquantities and desorbed and ionized by short (3-4 ns) UV-laser or IR-laser pulse. The ions are accelerated by an electric field to the same kinetic energy and sent into a field-free drift flight vacuum tube where ions of different m/z values are separated from each other. The velocity of the ions depends only on the m/z -that is, heavier molecules travel at lower speed and thus reach the detector later. The detection of analytes from a single target spot can be accomplished in several seconds. For analysis of NAs, the TOF needed for the ionized analyte to reach the detector is recorded and used to derive the analyte mass. This method has resolution reaching 1 Da that allows for the discrimination of single nucleotides. A schematic representation of MALDI-TOF MS is shown in Figure 2 .",

The pathogen specificity can be detected using the entire PCR fragment or site-specific cleavage products of the fragment. Many sensitive pathogen identification assays require amplification or a particular labeling of the signature molecule. Visualization or detection of the NA generally involves size separation or detection of the labeled probe.

Specific and reproducible molecular identification of Mycobacterium spp. was successfully achieved by base-specific cleavage of transcripts generated from 16S rDNA amplicons and MS separation of the resulting RNA fragments [31] . The new biosensor technology, triangulation identification genetic evaluation of biological risks (TIGER) [32] , on the Ibis T5000 platform was developed using ESI-MS. The molecular element of the test starts with 16S RNA as a base, and adds on the use of broad-range primers aimed at essential housekeeping genes from bacterial, fungal and protozoan pathogens or specific genomic regions of viruses. The targeted PCR amplicons are mixed with an internal calibrant amplicon of known concentration. Analysis is accomplished by matching the base composition of the detected fragments to a database of composition signatures, predetermined for every particular organism. As the different isolates of each pathogen differ slightly, the system handles the diversity by building the probability space from the composition constraints for each species. By a stepwise process of joint maximum likelihood and maximum likelihood clustering, the sample is assigned an organism ID and its abundance estimated. The algorithm involves more than one locus per pathogen. The redundancy affords as high an accuracy of pathogen identification as can be achieved by direct sequencing [15, 32] . PLEX-ID is the more current version of the technology and it expands to viral detection [33] . A schematic representation of the test and the process pipeline are shown in Figure 4 .",

The indirect detection methods take advantage of the MS ability to detect and differentiate among fairly small molecular tags that can be cleaved from NAs to identify a specific target that may itself not be amenable to MS because of size constraints and is illustrated in Figure 3B . A recent development is based on using a photocleavable linker with tagged molecules for PCR and ELISA quantification coupled to MS [43] .

UTP or CTP are modified to prevent cleavage by RNase A. Each reaction is carried out isothermally where transcription and cleavage occur simultaneously.

It has been proposed that the host uses chromatin methylation as a defense against DNA viruses, because most CpG sites in the host genomes are methylated so as to regulate gene expression and facilitate the recognition of pathogen-associated DNA [51] .

One of the first HBV genotyping assays adapted to MS was based on MALDI-TOF [63] . Recently, an improved approach to HBV genotyping was designed and implemented using the MassARRAY platform. The assay did not only detect genotypes accurately but was capable of identifying new HBV variants [64] . Genotyping was achieved by comparison of mass patterns experimentally obtained from the S gene of the tested strain to computer-simulated HBV variants with known genotype. Multiple parameters such as viral titer, genotype, heterogeneity, quality of PCR products and MS patterns were carefully evaluated in the design and testing of this assay. The quality of PCR product was found to be the only property that significantly affected the accuracy of HBV genotyping. Assay outcomes had complete concordance with the gold-standard sequence results. Although it was not capable of specifying minor HBV genotypes in mixed-genotype infection cases, the predominant genotype was never reported erroneously. Given the sufficient quality of PCR products, MS patterns with low matching score to the reference dataset indicated either the mixed-genotype infection or presence of new HBV variants. The flexible assay design allowed for a rapid adjustment to the detection of such new HBV variants by simply updating the reference dataset with these variants. Highly amenable to automation and high-throughput detection, this assay was commended for molecular surveillance of HBV infection as a low-cost alternative to the sequence-based methods [65] .",

Identifying genetic diversity by means of detection of SNP instead of using a complete genome sequence scale is a very practical approach to identifying important genetic variants of pathogens ( Figure 3E ). MS is especially applicable to SNP analysis [61] . After the introduction of the base-specific cleavage concept [46] , MS-based SNP analysis has found many fields for its application [7, 66, 67] . Multilocus genotyping in massively parallel tests is becoming a preferred strategy for the accurate and high-throughput human SNP detection [18, 68] , with MALDI-TOF MS being among the most powerful and widely used technological platforms. A major advantage of the MS application to molecular diagnostics originates from the unmatched capacity of MS to decode reliably the composition of complex mixtures of short DNA or RNA fragments, and its amenability to high-throughput analysis of such mixtures. The basespecific degradation of PCR products has been extensively used for the specific detection of pathogens, pathogen genotypes and even minor genetic variations associated, for example, with drug resistance [69] . Resolution of products of the base-specific degradation by MS dramatically improves the speed, throughput and accuracy of detection [11, 70] .",

MS and direct sequencing showed only 0.1% discordance in variant calls; however, MS was able to detect twice as many minor variants as direct sequencing while achieving close to full automation and more sensitive detection [26] . The RFMP-based MALDI-TOF MS approach was developed for the detection of mutations in the HBV polymerase, particularly in the YMDD motif. The assay was found to be sufficiently sensitive for the early detection of HBV-breakthrough infections in patients on therapeutic treatment with polymerase inhibitors [73] . A similar approach showed a remarkable ability in detecting as few as 100 copies of the HBV genome. It correctly identified several known viral variants, finding minority intra-host viral variants undetectable by other tested methods and estimating the relative abundance of the variants [74] . The RFMP-based MALDITOF assay has been evaluated in comparison to the commercially available INNO-LiPA HBV DR assay based on reverse hybridization lineprobe technology. The MS assay provided the greater detection sensitivity for the mutations of interest and identified additional minor intra-host viral subpopulations [75] , heralding its clinical applicability.",

The assay detected patterns of short RNA fragments or kmers. It was found that the k-mer structure of the MS data closely reflects the heterogeneity of viral populations. Since the genetic distances estimated using MSPs are affected by sequence heterogeneity and composition of intra-host HCV populations [82] , MSPs were shown to be highly applicable to evaluating phylogenetic relationships among HCV strains. The analyses revealed that there is a fundamental similarity between MSP-and sequencebased distances, making them suitable for the genetic detection of transmissions. The separation between MSP distances among genetically related and unrelated cases is clear and permitted discrimination of the HCV variants involved in the outbreaks. Such detection of transmission does not require complete assessment of phylogenetic relationships among the HCV variants and, therefore, can be achieved using a threshold and visualized using simple linkage graphs. The MSP-based detection of HCV transmissions matched the accuracy of sequence-based methods, paving the way for the application of MS to molecular surveillance of viral hepatitis [65] .",

Generation of sequence ladder in the presence of one specific primer, regular nucleotides, dideoxynucleotides and polymerase, resulting in random termination of the fragments at any and all positions, allowing the discrimination of two fragments by one added nucleotide. (D) Sequencing by transcription with T6 and SP6 polymerases, coupled to RNase A single basespecific cleavage. The process queries both strands of each amplicon of interest. The resulting mass fingerprint contains information about all four nucleotides and is used to derive the fragment's sequence, genotype and heterogeneity and to discover new mutations by in silico pattern comparison to a comprehensive reference set. (E) SNP identification by multiplex PCR. Each product is then queried by a specific probe designed immediately upstream from a SNP of interest and then extended in the presence of ddNTP mix. The resulting extended probes present a mass signature that identifies the SNP sequence. Depending on the assay design (e.g., T5000) the multiplex product could be used directly for MS with the resulting mass patterns used for organism identification.
