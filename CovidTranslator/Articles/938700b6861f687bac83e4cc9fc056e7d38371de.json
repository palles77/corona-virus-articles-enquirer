Most medical students (93.5% and 81.6%, respectively) correctly identifi ed hand washing and cough etiquette, respectively, as effective preventive measures (it is important to note, however, that there is a difference between students knowing and complying). Social distancing can help reduce the peak incidence of an epidemic and spread it over several weeks instead of a few, thus avoiding a healthcare surge (6) . Household quarantine is also effective at reducing attack rates in the community but only if the compliance rate is high (7) . Knowledge regarding treatment of pandemic infl uenza is diffi cult to analyze because determining what measures would be effective is complex. Given the time lag between identifi cation of the pandemic strain and the time needed to produce a vaccine, any known treatment strategy would not be effective unless it could be applied to the strain that is causing the pandemic.",

One argument is that medical students should be encouraged to volunteer during a crisis because this will provide valuable medical training at a time when a great deal of the workforce-including physicians and nurses-will be ill and unable to work. During the 1918 infl uenza pandemic, some medical students in the United States graduated early from medical school and had expedited medical board examinations to increase the number of medical personnel available to provide services (8) . Conversely, some may argue that placing the next generation of doctors on the front lines as volunteers will put them at increased risk for contracting illness. It is possible in this situation that the numbers of future physicians could decrease and adversely affect recovery efforts after a pandemic. During the severe acute respiratory syndrome crisis in Toronto, medical students were removed from the wards (D. Low, pers. comm.) (9) . Although this was done with good intentions and safety in mind, students experienced a great deal of frustration regarding the suspension of their education and research activities (9) .",

Anecdotes from the terrorist attacks in New York City on September 11, 2001 , relate how medical students helped in various capacities immediately following the tragedy (10). However, no offi cial school or government mandate was issued forcing these persons to volunteer. In contrast, after the devastation of Hurricane Rita, college leaders at Texas A&M University College of Medicine made a decision to cancel classes and provided orientation sessions for students so that they could begin volunteering as soon as possible (11) . Volunteer tasks in this situation were limited, and many voiced frustration that their relatively limited medical skills greatly restricted their ability to contribute. In a more positive vein, students also claimed that \"the experience made them even more driven to become the best doctors they can\" (11) .",
