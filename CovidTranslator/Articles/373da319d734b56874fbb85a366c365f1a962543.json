Cowling 1,4, * Human influenza viruses cause regular epidemics and occasional pandemics with a substantial public health burden. Household transmission studies have provided valuable information on the dynamics of influenza transmission. We reviewed published studies and found that once one household member is infected with influenza, the risk of infection in a household contact can be up to 38%, and the delay between onset in index and secondary cases is around 3 days. Younger age was associated with higher susceptibility. In the future, household transmission studies will provide information on transmission dynamics, including the correlation of virus shedding and symptoms with transmission, and the correlation of new measures of immunity with protection against infection.",

During influenza epidemics, high attack rates of generally mild and self-limiting illnesses cause a substantial public health burden, and a small fraction of infections are severe, requiring hospitalization [1] . Community-based studies of influenza virus infection and transmission have provided detailed information on influenza epidemiology since the 1920s [2] , with a series of seminal studies in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the most comprehensive of which was the 10-year Tecumseh study of acute respiratory infections in households [3, 4] . These studies conducted serologic and virologic testing of participants to determine the frequency of acute respiratory illnesses and identified the etiologic agents responsible. By enrolling entire households, these studies also examined transmission of respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus, identifying, for example, the importance of school-age children in introducing infections to the household [5] .",

Compared with other types of close contacts, household contacts are easier to identify and follow up, and they provide a well-defined number of susceptible people that are likely to have been exposed to infection, compared with other settings such as schools, offices, or hospitals. Household cohort studies can also permit inference on the transmission dynamics of influenza in households, providing valuable data on transmission in the broader community because a substantial fraction of influenza virus transmission events do occur in households [21, 22] . However, in many cohort studies infections are ascertained by serologic analysis, which can have imperfect sensitivity and specificity, and only provides what is known as final size data in which the number of infected and uninfected household members is known at the end of each epidemic [5] . Specialized methods have been developed to permit inference on transmission dynamics (who was infected by whom) based on final size data, allowing for the risks of acquiring infection from outside or inside the household [5, 23, 24] . It can be challenging to explore heterogeneities in transmission dynamics due to individual characteristics, for example age, when only final size data are available [7] . In addition, it is not possible to estimate the serial interval based on final size data, although this epidemiologic parameter, measuring the average time between illness onset in an infected person and a secondary case infected by that person, is an important parameter for mechanistic models (also called mathematical models) of influenza epidemics that are often used for policy planning [22, 25] . Some of these limitations can be ameliorated by careful collection of respiratory specimens from ill individuals, although intense follow up for illnesses over a prolonged period is challenging and demands considerable resources [26, 27] .",

Cohort studies were established to determine the cumulative incidence of H1N1pdm09 infections in 2009, but most such studies could not be established quickly enough to collect baseline pre-epidemic sera [30] .

In a household transmission study of influenza, in contrast to a traditional cohort study as described above, households are eligible for enrolment only after at least one household member has been identified as having an acute influenza virus infection [34] . This case can be referred to as the index case, and the other members as household contacts, with caveats on this terminology discussed below. In contrast to cohort studies, household transmission studies typically involve a short duration of follow-up of participants for 1 or 2 weeks, or in some cases 1 month to permit collection of convalescent sera. Collection of respiratory specimens, such as nasal swabs or sera, from household contacts permits ascertainment of secondary infections in the households with laboratory confirmation, and symptom diaries provide information on illnesses. Differences between the cohort and transmission study design are illustrated in Figure 1 . In principle, the transmission study is also a cohort study because it involves a defined cohort of individuals, but it differs from the traditional cohort study because only households with at least one infected person are included, and in theory the same household can be enrolled more than once ( Figure 1 ). Further complicating the distinction, it is also possible to effectively nest a transmission study within a cohort study, by intensively observing participants in a traditional cohort study and initiating additional investigations once one household member becomes infected [35] .",

One caveat of this design is that the identity of the person who first introduced infection into the household can be unclear, and may not necessarily be the person enrolled in the study as the 'index case'. For example, in one household, the first infected person may have very mild illness that is not apparent, but is sufficiently infectious to transmit infection to a second person who has a more serious illness, seeks care at an outpatient clinic, and is enrolled as the index case. Finally, it should be mentioned that the definition of a household In the cohort study, households are recruited before, and followed throughout, an epidemic, and some individuals are determined to have been infected by analysis of serological data (infected persons indicated as dark circles). By contrast, the household transmission study recruits households during the epidemic and includes only those households in which at least one person was infected. In this example, the index case in household A does not cause any secondary case, the index case in household B causes one secondary case, and household C is enrolled in the study twicethe first time when an index case causes two secondary cases, and the second time when another index case occurs (perhaps with a different type of influenza virus).",

In a basic descriptive analysis, this is simply the proportion of household contacts that develop cases of confirmed influenza virus infection, or the proportion of household contacts that develop an acute respiratory illness. The SIR has frequently been referred to as the 'secondary attack rate' in the literature [36] . However, we note that infections do not necessarily cause more severe illness (attack) and the quantity in question is a risk, that is, a proportion, not an incidence rate with a person-time denominator. The term 'secondary infection risk' therefore seems preferable [6] .",

These analyses make it possible to estimate the 'person-to-person' household transmission risk, that is, the probability of transmission from a case to a single household member. The person-to-person household transmission risk is usually lower than the SIR because of the additional risk of the household contact acquiring infection from another source apart from the index case [38] . Modeling studies and analyses of the homology in virus sequences between infections in index cases and household contact confirmed that almost all infections in household contacts in the short period after onset in an index case will have been acquired within households rather than from outside the household, confirming the feasibility and applicability of this study design to assess transmission within households [39] [40] [41] [42] .",

The number of contacts with influenza-like illness (ILI), or the number of contacts with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in household contacts, can also be used to estimate the risk of secondary infections and illnesses. In published studies, there has been considerable heterogeneity in the reported secondary infection risks for laboratory-confirmed influenza and illness (Figure 2A) . The secondary infection risks of PCR-confirmed infection among household contacts ranged from 1% to 38%, while those based on ILI ranged from 6% to 35%, and those based on ARI ranged from 3% to 31%. Some studies reported secondary infection risks based on more than one of these case definitions. Approaches to ascertaining index cases and then identifying infections and illnesses in household contacts likely contributed to the substantial heterogeneity in estimates of the secondary infection risk (Figure 2A) . A previous review found that studies that collected respiratory specimens regardless of illness in household contacts reported higher secondary infection risks, compared with those studies that collected swab specimens only from symptomatic contacts [6] . Another potential explanation for the heterogeneity was that, in some studies, there was delay between symptom onset in index cases and the start of follow-up of households, and hence very small secondary infection risks were reported [56, 91] . There is no reason to believe that there is a single true value of the secondary infection risk in a particular location since the degree of transmission that occurs in households will depend on the characteristics of the household members, the degree of contact between them, and the household environment.",

In a few studies, more complex models were used to relax these assumptions, such as household transmission models that estimated the probability of person-to-person transmission in households and community infection acquired from outside the household [38, 42, 52, 88] or other type of transmission models based on final size data [62, 89] .",

While an antibody titer of 1:40 measured by hemagglutination inhibition is generally associated with 50% protection against infection [95] [96] [97] , one study suggested that a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 was only associated with 31% protection in the household setting [88] , potentially because of exposures of greater duration or intensity in the confined setting of households. As more components of humoral immunity are quantified, by, for example, virus neutralization assays, neuraminidaseinhibition assays, or fusion-inhibition assays, the household transmission study may be a particularly efficient study design to validate the correlation of measurements from these assays with protection against infection or illness. In the same way, transmission studies could also be used to study cell-mediated immunity and innate immunity.",

However, some limitations of these studies should be noted. First, in a household transmission study, index cases are generally enrolled after presenting for medical attention and therefore are biased towards infections that cause more serious illness. If more severe illness was associated with greater transmissibility, then the estimates of transmissibility from household transmission studies may be overestimated. More generally, in household transmission studies it is not possible to estimate the total number of secondary infections in all settings caused by one index case (i.e., the reproductive number) because data are not collected outside the household. Second, because of the case ascertainment, households without any infections will not be enrolled (Figure 1 ), and it is not possible to estimate population-based rates of infection unless the transmission study is nested in a larger cohort study. Third, it is possible to characterize the mild end of clinical severity by assessing illnesses in household contacts, but severe disease is rare, and only very large transmission studies would be able to estimate, for example, the risk of hospitalization if infected with influenza.",

As we have discussed above, once one household member is infected with influenza, the risk of infection in a household contact can be up to 38%, and the delay between onset in index and secondary cases is around 3 days ( Figure 2B ). As new innovative approaches for data collection become available [10, 12, 102] , it should be possible to improve and simplify data collection in household transmission studies. Although not discussed in this review, household transmission studies can also provide information on the severity of typical influenza virus infections. Whereas index cases, ascertained either by presenting for medical attention or reporting symptoms, are not likely to be representative of all natural infections, because milder cases would have a lower probability of being ascertained, the infections among secondary cases may give a representative picture of the severity of natural infections [40, 54, 83, 84] .
