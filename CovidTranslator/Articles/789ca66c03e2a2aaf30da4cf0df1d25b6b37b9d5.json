Control efforts are hampered by limited vaccine effectiveness, coinfection with HIV, insufficient diagnostic capacity in low income settings, prolonged treatment courses and the emergence of drug resistant strains. 3, 4 Globally an estimated 500,000 deaths annually are attributable to influenza. 5 Viral reassortment can lead to novel strains with pandemic potential, such as H1N1pdm09 strain which emerged in Mexico in 2009 and rapidly spread worldwide. This strain remained the dominant influenza strain across Europe in 2013, and the emerging H7N9 strain provides further cause for immediate concern. 6 .",

We report on the funding for respiratory infection-related research awarded to UK institutions. We identify areas of research strength and possible investment gaps in relation to respiratory global health that will be of relevance to policy-makers, funders and researchers, and briefly discuss how new approaches might help with allocating existing resources and identifying new sources of investment.",

Funders were either considered in their own right, or were grouped into categories, such as in-house university funding, research charities, and government departments. A total of 26 funder categories were used. 19 This categorisation was carried out by author MGH, with provisional datasets circulated to authors for review and comment, and JRF, MKC and FBW further verified a random sample of 10% of the dataset, with author agreement measured by a Kappa score (0.95) and differences settled by consensus. We excluded studies not immediately relevant to infection, veterinary infectious disease research studies (unless there was a clear zoonotic component), and studies where there were UK collaborators, but the funding was awarded to a non-UK institution. Unfunded studies were also excluded. Grants awarded in a currency other than pounds sterling were converted to UK pounds using the mean exchange rate in the year of the award.

Also, assigning studies to categories is a subjective and imperfect process -although we used two researchers to do this to 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 ",

Control efforts are hampered by limited vaccine effectiveness, co-infection with HIV, insufficient diagnostic capacity in low income settings, prolonged treatment courses and the emergence of drug resistant strains. 3, 4 Globally an estimated 500,000 deaths annually are attributable to influenza. 5 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   6 the aetiology of chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, 12 chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, 13 and cystic fibrosis, 14 as well as acting as a trigger for acute cardiovascular events. 15 UK institutions have received an estimated \u00a32.6 billion of public and charitable funding to carry out infectious disease research between 1997 and 2010, of which around one-third was designated as related to global health, 16 and according to estimates from Policy Cures, the UK ranks second globally in terms of the amount of R&D funding for infectious disease research. 17 Funding covers all types of science along the R&D value chain from pre-clinical to operational and implementation research.

There was very little funding for translational research relating to pneumonia, a clear gap in the UK portfolio. Other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and pertussis, which are causes of high disease burden globally, also received very limited research funding despite there clearly being the need for translational and operational research. 16 The worldwide burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis is rapidly increasing, with WHO estimates of 630,000 cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis worldwide, great variation between countries, and emergence over the last decade of extensively drug-resistant cases. 24 Given the difficulties of developing a more effective vaccine, 25 the need for new diagnostics, therapeutics and targeted use of existing medicines becomes even more important.

Most countries are under-investing in tuberculosis R&D 31 33 It should also be noted that considerations other than incidence should ultimately influence the allocation of resources. Such considerations may include the prevalence and predicted impact of the disease, how treatable the disease is (antibiotic courses and combinations are very different between pneumonia and tuberculosis), co-factors and co-morbities (e.g. Our study has several limitations, which have been highlighted and discussed in detail elsewhere. 16 There was little publicly-available data from the pharmaceutical industry.

Such considerations may include the prevalence and predicted impact of the disease, how treatable the disease is (antibiotic courses and combinations are very different between pneumonia and tuberculosis), co-factors and co-morbities (e.g. tuberculosis and co-infection with HIV), consideration of how other types of research may impact and inform the issues of controlling spread of respiratory infectious disease (e.g. basic immunology research may eventually inform future vaccine development) and anticipation of future new tools, technologies or research methods.

Participants: Institutions that host and carry out infectious disease research Primary and secondary outcome measures: The total spend and numbers of studies with a focus on several different respiratory pathogens or diseases, and to correlate these against the global burden of disease; also, the total spend and numbers of studies relating to the type of science, the predominant funder in each category, and the mean and median award size. Results: We identified 6165 infectious disease studies with total investment of \u00a32\u00b76 billion. Respiratory research received \u00a3419 million (16.1%) across 1192 (19.3%) studies. The Wellcome Trust provided greatest investment (\u00a3135.2 million; 32.3%). Tuberculosis received \u00a3155 million (37.1%), influenza \u00a380 million (19.1%) and pneumonia just \u00a327.8 million (6.6%). Despite high burden, there was relatively little investment in vaccine-preventable diseases including diphtheria (\u00a30.1 million, 0.03%) and measles (\u00a35.0 million, 1.2%), and drugresistant tuberculosis. There were 802 pre-clinical studies (67.3%) receiving \u00a3273 million (65.2%), whilst implementation research received \u00a381 million (19.3%) across 274 studies (23%). There were comparatively few phase I-IV trials or product development studies.

We report on the funding for respiratory infection-related research awarded to UK institutions. We identify areas of research strength and possible investment gaps in relation to respiratory global health that will be of relevance to policy-makers, funders and researchers, and briefly discuss how new approaches might help with allocating existing resources and identifying new sources of investment.We analysed studies funded over a 14-year period (1997-2010 inclusive) and identified those relevant to respiratory infectious disease. Global health studies were defined as those which investigated diseases not endemic in the UK, or where the study had a clear reference to another country (e.g. tuberculosis in South Africa). The pneumonia category included pre-clinical studies forStreptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.We excluded open-access data from the pharmaceutical industry as it was limited and not representative. The methods have been described in detail previously.18  The overarching dataset was constructed byapproaching the major sources of public and charitable funding for infectious disease research studies, including the Wellcome Trust, Medical Research Council and other research councils, UK government departments, the European Commission, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and other research charities (figure 1). Where feasible, the funding decisions listed on their website were For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml searched for infectious disease research awards (e.g. Wellcome Trust); otherwise, the funder was directly approached and asked to provide information on their infection-related awards. Other databases were also searched, including Clinicaltrials.gov and the National Research Register.Each study was screened for relevance to infectious disease research and assigned to as many primary disease categories as appropriate.19  Within each category, topic-specific sub-sections (including specific pathogen or disease) were documented. Studies were also allocated to one of four categories along the R&D value chain: pre-clinical; phase 1, 2, or 3; product development; and implementation and operational research19  . Funders were either considered in their own right, or were grouped into categories, such as in-house university funding, research charities, and government departments. A total of 26 funder categories were used.19  This categorisation was carried out by author MGH, with provisional datasets circulated to authors for review and comment, and JRF, MKC and FBW further verified a random sample of 10% of the dataset, with author agreement measured by a Kappa score (0.95) and differences settled by consensus. We excluded studies not immediately relevant to infection, veterinary infectious disease research studies (unless there was a clear zoonotic component), and studies where there were UK collaborators, but the funding was awarded to a non-UK institution. Unfunded studies were also excluded. Grants awarded in a currency other than pounds sterling were converted to UK pounds using the mean exchange rate in the year of the award. All awards were adjusted for inflation and reported in 2010 UK pounds.

Over half of the research funding was for tuberculosis and influenza. Vaccine development and global health studies form a key part of the UK research output, although there is proportionately less global health research within respiratory infectious disease than across all infectious disease. During this study period, there were increases in influenza research funding but very limited funding for emerging infections such as coronaviruses.

Tuberculosis, influenza and pneumonia all received increased investment in 2005-2010 as compared with 1997-2004; this may be due to a more systematic approach to collecting burden data, and thus translating into R&D investments. The focus on influenza will likely have been at least in part due to the highlighting of emerging strains with pandemic potential. The strong correlation between burden and investment is encouraging with, broadly, the high-burden diseases receiving greater funding (pneumonia being the key exception), and lower-burden infections less funding.

We rely on the original data being complete and accurate, and are unable to take into account distribution of funds from the lead institution to collaborating partners, nor can we assess quantity of each award given to overheads or the impact of the introduction of full-economic costing. Also, assigning studies to categories is a subjective and imperfect process -although we used two researchers to do this to reduce inter-observer error. Our study focuses on UK-led investments -we do not know if similar patterns (e.g. a dominance of pre-clinical research and lack of public or charitably-funded clinical trials) would also emerge if the analysis were repeated for other high-income countries. We have not here measured either the outputs or impact of funded research. The assessment against measures of burden used the most comprehensive DALY figures available, but they are only estimates and their reliability is not precisely known.The UK is well-placed to contribute to many of the priority research areas that need additional funding, given particular focuses on pre-clinical science as well as operational and implementationresearch. However, there is a need for funders in other countries to provide similar and detailed information on funded studies, and so build a global research funding database.
