Although many novel strategies are used, one approach not widely applied involves improving the treatment of animals. Emerging infectious diseases are pressing public health challenges that could benefit from improving the treatment of animals. Other human health issues, that overlap with animal treatment issues, and that warrant further exploration, are medical research and domestic violence. The diverse nature of these health issues and their connection with animal treatment suggest that there may be other similar intersections. Public health would benefit by including the treatment of animals as a topic of study and policy development.",

Their multifactorial roots necessitate strategies that go well beyond the traditional health sector.

[7] [8] [9] In recent years, however, the virus has undergone an evolutionary surge, with new variants emerging rapidly. The intensive confinement of animals is shown to be a major contributor to this surge. 9,10 Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1, first isolated in the Guangdong Province of China in 1996, is one of the most notable pathogens to appear recently. 11, 12 Most avian influenzas begin as mildly pathogenic viruses. 13 Once they enter domestic bird populations, they may rapidly mutate into highly pathogenic viruses. Research demonstrates that after circulation in domestic birds for very short periods, low-pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) viruses can mutate into HPAIs. 14 Since 1990, outbreaks of HPAI virus subtypes have become more common in farmed birds compared with before 1990. 8, 9, 14 Intensive confinement of birds facilitates both the increasing frequency and scale of these outbreaks. 9, 10 According to the World Organization for Animal Health of the Food and Agriculture Organization, two lessons should be learned from these prior outbreaks. 15 First, that if LPAI viruses are allowed to spread among farmed birds, they can eventually mutate into HPAI viruses; and second, that densely confining birds considerably increases their vulnerability to infectious diseases.",

SARS is now believed to have originated from large fruit bats. 29, 30 Bats had been captured in the wild and traded live in Chinese markets. At some point in the wildlife supply chain, infected bats were likely brought into contact with susceptible hosts, such as civets, in whom the virus amplified. The intermingling of species established a cycle in which susceptible animals and humans could become infected. After the SARS epidemics subsided, an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health made this observation: 'The concentration of animals, their overlapping sojourns in the markets (allowing disease to spread through vast numbers of animals), and their interactions with humans (facilitating human infection) make these markets ripe for zoonoses. Once an epidemic starts among these animals, it can spread to animals reared in less cruel conditions'. 31 Butchering and eating of non-human primates through the bushmeat trade probably led to the emergence of HIV. 32, 33 Similarly, Ebola virus has been traced back to the trade in non-human primates, bats, forest antelopes, rodents, and shrews. [34] [35] [36] The Nipah virus, first identified in the Sungai Nipah New Village in Malaysia, spread throughout the region through the trucking of infected pigs. 37 ",

More than 115 million animals are used each year in experiments or to supply the biomedical industry. 38 Although the topic of animal research has not traditionally been viewed as a public health issue, its use is inextricably tied to the safety and efficacy of medical therapeutics, that play an integral role in many public health applications, including those intended to combat EIDs. Successful anti-infectious disease campaigns, for example, often rely on the availability of safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics, that in turn, depend on reliable and predictive pre-clinical research. A new study found that the mouse models used extensively to study human inflammatory diseases, including infectious diseases, only poorly mimic the human condition. 39 This calls into question the reliability of mouse models to identify, develop, and test drug and vaccine candidates. 39 Indeed, because of apparent stagnation in the invention of useful drugs, leaders in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have argued that poor predictability of animal testing is among the chief challenges facing the drug discovery community. 40 The stresses induced in the laboratory can affect animals' physiology and perturb study results. 41, 42 This begs the question: How relevant is animal testing for predicting human health outcomes? [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] Researchers need to develop human-based testing methods to better identify and predict the safety and efficacy of potential pharmaceutics.",

Surveillance is constrained by our infrastructure plus scientific limitations. Relying on inspection of shipments remains impractical. Gerson and colleagues estimated that only 2 per cent of the more than 12 million commercial shipments into Canada annually are physically inspected. 58 Pathogens that cause little or no overt signs of illnesses in animals will likely go undetected. The H7N9 avian influenza virus, for example, does not cause apparent illness among farmed birds, thus silent spread puts humans at risk. 59 Trying to predict which virus subtypes circulating among animals that will pose dangers to humans is extremely difficult. 60 Culling and vaccination campaigns may in the short term quell an epidemic, but they have frequently failed to provide lasting solutions. More than 100 million birds were killed throughout Asia in an effort to thwart the spread of H5N1. 61 However, the next wave of H5N1 re-established itself in the same countries and spread to new ones. Poultry vaccination programs in Asia and Egypt did not prevent the re-emergence and spread of H5N1. 62, 63 Indeed, vaccination may spur the evolution of the virus. 64, 65 Whether vaccination programs in China lead to greater genetic diversity of the H5N1 virus and contribute to current strains is one of many questions to consider. 66 Moreover, was a low-pathogenic precursor to H5N1 from wild birds introduced to poultry populations through household or 'backyard' flocks? Or was a precursor introduced through commercial confinement operations? Although backyard flocks may serve as conduits that transfer avian influenza viruses to domestic bird populations, their contribution to the emergence and spread of H5N1 may have been overestimated. In an analysis of a 2004 poultry outbreak of H5N1 in Thailand, Graham and colleagues found the likelihood of outbreaks to be far greater in large-scale commercial operations than in backyard flocks. 67 Additionally, there are numerous routes by which pathogens can be introduced to commercial operations. Studies in Canada, the Netherlands, and Denmark reached similar conclusions. 68 The discovery of H7N9 suggests that current mitigation efforts are failing to prevent the emergence of new, dangerous strains. Ultimately, strategies will have the greatest chance of success in preventing further evolution of avian influenza and other pathogens if they confront the underlying causes of pathogen emergence, some of which are rooted in the poor treatment of animals.",

If, to benefit animals, we focus on reducing the number of animals confined in industrial farms and traded worldwide, opportunities for the emergence and spread of new pathogens would decrease and benefit people. Plant-based diets can reduce the number of animals confined in industrial farms and further decrease emergence of zoonotic pathogens. Such diets also confer environmental and personal health benefits. 5, 22 Might animal protection organizations join public health colleagues to forge a public campaign against the keeping of exotic animals as pets and for entertainment? Public health agencies and animal protection organizations should work with policymakers to enact restrictions on wildlife importation. Reduced use of animals in experiments deserves emphasis by government institutions that fund research. 22 Finally, if there were greater coordination on animal protection between public health, veterinary and social services, together we might increase detection of all forms of violence and thwart future acts of violence. 56 ",
