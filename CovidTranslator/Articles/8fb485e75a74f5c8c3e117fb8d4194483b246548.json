The oral administration of chicken egg yolk specific antibodies (IgYs) has been established as an efficient alternative for treatment and prevention of gastrointestinal pathogens including Salmonella. The present study was aimed to investigate the possible production of specific IgYs against Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis in quail egg yolks. Salmonella spp.-free female Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) were intramuscularly immunized with formalin or heat-inactivated Salmonella immunogens (1.0 \u00d7 10 9 CFU/mL) emulsified with Freund adjuvants. Egg yolk IgYs were purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation method. Anti-Salmonella IgYs titer and specificity were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis. Salmonella specific IgYs detected in the immunized quails were significantly higher than those of the control group, which confirmed the immunization procedure. Specific IgYs against S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis were identified in both groups immunized with heat or formalin-inactivated immunogens. However, formalin-inactivated immunogens induced relatively higher immune responses over the heat-inactivated ones. Quail anti-Salmonella IgYs showed a high specificity to their corresponding immunogens, with moderate crossreactivity to other members of Enterobacteriaceae family. Quail can be regarded as a valuable and inexpensive source for producing large-scale of specific antibodies that can be used for immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic purposes.",

The administration of specific antibodies has been prompted by the need to find an alternative to conventional antibiotic therapies, in response to the increasing number of antibiotic-resistant or nonresponsive organisms.

Chicken IgYs are transferred in large quantities from serum to the egg yolks (with a concentration of about 25 mg/mL) in order to give passive immunity to the developing offspring (Kovacs-Nolan and https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molimm.2019.01.012 Received 13 March 2018; Received in revised form 9 January 2019; Accepted 15 January 2019 Mine, 2004) . The overall structure of chicken IgYs is somewhat similar to the mammalian IgG, with two heavy (H) and two light (L) chains. IgY possesses four constant domains in heavy chain (C\u03bd1-C\u03bd4) that makes them have a higher molecular weight (180 kDa) than mammalian IgG (159 kDa).

            "text": "The use of chicken eggs as a source of specific polyclonal antibodies offers several advantages over producing antibodies in mammals. Harvesting antibodies from eggs laid by immunized chickens is much less invasive and only requires the collection of eggs rather than blood sampling in mammals. Furthermore, the sustained high and long-lasting antibody titer in chickens reduces the need for frequent booster injections and is, therefore, more advantageous in the consideration of animal welfare (G\u00fcrtler et al., 2004; Najdi et al., 2016; Schade et al., 1992) . In contrast to IgG, IgY does not either interact with mammalian Fc receptors or activate the complement system, so it does not mediate inflammatory responses or interfere with immunological assays. Due to the long phylogenetic distance between avian and mammals, chickens can more efficiently produce antibodies against highly conserved mammalian proteins. This also requires much less antigen to prompt an effective immune response (Nilsson et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2011) . Chickens, thus, can be considered as convenient, cost-effective, and rich sources of specific antibodies that have been applied successfully for immunodiagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic purposes in recent years.",

The photoperiodicity was also controlled at 14 h lighting and 10 h darkness. The breeding conditions were approved by the Shiraz University Policy on Animal Care and Use. The birds were adapted to the new environment for two weeks prior immunization. Salmonella spp.-free status was confirmed by bacteriological analysis of cloacal swabs (ISO, 2002) , bacterial culture, and PCR technique on arrival date. The mentioned tests were repeated every two weeks throughout the experiment. For immunization, 0.25 mL of whole bacterial suspension (1.0 \u00d7 10 9 CFU/mL) was emulsified with an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in the first immunization and 0.5 ml was injected into the quails' superficial pectoral muscles. Groups 1 to 4 were immunized as follows; group 1, formalininactivated S. typhimurium (FIST), group 2, heat-inactivated S. typhimurium (HIST), group 3, formalin-inactivated S. enteritidis (FISE), and group 4, heat-inactivated S. enteritidis (HISE). From the second to the fourth immunization, Freund's complete adjuvant was replaced with the Freund's incomplete adjuvant. In the fifth and sixth immunizations, the booster injections were carried out in the absence of adjuvant. Incomplete Freund's adjuvant is considered to be one of the most effective adjuvants that widely used in subsequent immunizations for consistently producing high titer antibodies. However, it may produce severe chronic local inflammation and causing skin ulcerations. Therefore, after four immunizations with Freund's adjuvants and in order to minimize theses adverse effects, the adjuvant was removed in the last two immunizations. All immunizations were conducted at two weeks interval. The control group (group 5) was administered with 0.25 mL of sterile PBS plus 0.25 mL adjuvant, except for the last two immunizations that sterile PBS was injected without adjuvant.

(2008) with minor modifications (Kitaguchi et al., 2008) . Briefly, egg yolk was carefully separated from albumin; then, the yolk's membrane was punctured and the whole yolk was allowed to drain into a glass dish and homogenized completely. Five gram of the well-mixed yolk was transferred into a sterile tube and diluted with 9 volumes of distilled dionized water acidified to pH 5.1 with 0.1 N HCl and stored at 4\u00b0C overnight. After incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 g for 25 min at 4\u00b0C and the supernatant was collected and gently mixed with an equal volume of 40% saturated ammonium sulfate. The mixture was left to stand for 4 h at room temperature and then centrifuged at 12,000 \u00d7 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed later on. The pellets were re-suspended in 5 ml sterile PBS and dialyzed against 20 mM phosphate buffer at 4\u00b0C overnight. The dialyzed samples were stored at \u221220\u00b0C and used for the determination of the anti-Salmonella IgYs concentration by ELISA. The IgY purity and yield of eggs were analyzed on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) using 12% resolving and 5% stacking gels. Gel staining was carried out with Coomassie blue solution (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and size standards were determined using Prestained Protein Ladder (Cat. No. PR901641,Cinna Clon, Iran) in the gel.",

            "text": "In this study, the possible production of immunoglobulin Y specific to Salmonella typhimurium and Salmonella enteritidis in quail egg yolks and its utilization on ELISA and Western blot as a diagnostic tool were investigated. The SDS-PAGE analysis of purified antibodies revealed high purity and quantity of the product at about 25 kDa as a light chain and a 68 kDa as a heavy chain. These results were confirmed by the findings reported by Kassim et al. (2011) and Bae et al. (2009) who obtained two bands of light and heavy chains of quail IgYs at the same molecular weight. Therefore, egg yolk antibody purification method proposed by Kitaguchi et al. (2008) can achieve high yield and purity of IgYs in quail. Specific IgYs against S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis resulted from either heat or formalin-inactivated immunogens were started to increase in egg yolks from the second week after the first immunization. Since chickens transfer the maternal antibodies to the egg yolks for the protection of the embryos as a passive immunity, the lag time observed in the first two weeks may stands for the time it takes specific antibodies to be produced and transferred from the serum to the egg yolks. Antibody responses increased steadily from day 14 to 49 in all groups and reached a peak at day 49, following the fourth immunization. Second antibody production peak was observed at day 84 in FISE, HISE, HIST groups and day 70 in FIST group. Comparing the groups immunized with heat or formalin-inactivated antigens, relatively stronger immune responses were obtained against formalin-inactivated immunogens. Subjecting the bacteria to the 100\u00b0C for 20 min for producing heat-inactivated immunogen would denature the outer membrane protein (OMP) which may serve as one of the main antigenic factors, involved in stimulating the immune system, as well as an epitope for the antibody. Therefore, heat may affect the antibody responses and also antigen-antibody binding possibilities by changing the antigenic epitopes. In accordance with our results, previous researches also reported the higher immunogenicity of formalin-inactivated antigens over the heat-inactivated ones regarding different bacteria (Kassim et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Few studies have explored the production, purification, and utilization of quail egg yolk specific antibodies. Quail IgYs have been produced against Influenza HIV-1 viruses (Kovgan et al., 1989) , Plant potyviruses (Somowiyarjo et al., 1990) , Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio vulnificus (Kassim et al., 2011) , and Helicobacter pylori (Najdi et al., 2016) . Kassim et al. (2011) investigated the possible production of specific egg yolk IgY against Vibrio SPP. in Coturnix quail. Specific IgYs started to increase in egg yolks from the 14th day after the first immunization and the highest titer was reached at day 35 for V. vulnificus and day 42 for V. parahaemolyticus. The second antibody production peak was observed at day 63 for both immunogens; then, the peaks were followed by an irreversible decline in spite of the booster immunization. Formalin-inactivated immunogens induced higher immunoresponses in both quails immunized with V. vulnificus or V. parahaemolyticus over those immunized with heat-inactivated immunogens (Kassim et al., 2011) . This result is in agreement with the pattern we observed in quails immunized with Salmonella SPP. Najdi et al. (2016) also examined the production and specificity of quail anti-Helicobacter pylori IgY and showed that specific IgYs started to rise in egg yolk from the 28th day after the first immunization. The first and the second peaks of anti-H. pylori IgY were observed at days 35 and 56, respectively. This study revealed that higher doses of antigen could not definitely develop higher immune responses and that the oral administration of antigen could generate an effective immunization in quail (Najdi et al., 2016) . In contrary to this research, a reduction in antibody level was observed at day 56 in all groups immunized with S. typhimurium or S. enteritidis. Subsequently, antibody titer was recovered from day 63 following the 5th immunization. Variations in antibody production patterns among different studies might be due to the differences in individual immune responses, type and dose of antigens, route of antigen administration as well as the specificity and sensitivity of the tools used for assessing the antibody level.",

In the case of anti-S. enteritidis IgY, the highest and lowest cross-reactivity were observed with S. typhimurium (65.1%) and M. haemolytica (12.05%), respectively. Generally, quail anti-Salmonella IgYs showed a high specificity to their corresponding immunogens, with moderate binding affinity to other members of Enterobacteriaceae family (p < 0.05). The high cross-reactivity of anti-Salmonella IgYs observed between S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis can be explained by the fact that Salmonella serovars share many epitopes (Kudrna et al., 1985) . Chalghoumi et al. (2008) used the outer membrane protein of S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis as a target of immunization and reported a high cross-reactivity of up to 78.8% for anti-S. typhimurium IgY to S. enteritidis, and up to 71.7% for anti-S. enteritidis IgY against S. typhimurium (Chalghoumi et al., 2008) . The observed values of cross-reactivity of quail anti-Salmonella IgYs were lower than those reported in hens. We used the inactivated whole bacteria cells for the immunization in quails while hens were immunized with purified OMP. It is more likely that the degree of cross-reactivity directed against a purified immunogen like OMP, with more shared epitopes among Salmonella spp., is higher than that directed against a whole bacteria cell.",

They are less expensive, easily manageable in terms of housing, and experimentally convenient due to their small size (Bae et al., 2009; Scholtz et al., 2010) . Quails require fewer volumes of antigens for immunization which is an advantage for producing antibodies against viruses and recombinant proteins that can be purified at low concentrations (Somowiyarjo et al., 1990) . They achieve sexual maturity at seven weeks of age as opposed to the 20-24 weeks required for a hen to start laying eggs. Moreover, quails have a high rate of egg laying (280-300 eggs per year), and immunization does not result in the reduction of egg production (Bae et al., 2009; Najdi et al., 2016) . However, despite having several advantages, only few studies have utilized quails for investigating the immune responses against pathogens.",
