            "text": "Background: Viral encephalitis is a dangerous compromise between the need to robustly clear pathogen from the brain and the need to protect neurons from bystander injury. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection of C57Bl/6 mice is a model of viral encephalitis in which the compromise results in hippocampal damage and permanent neurological sequelae. We previously identified brain infiltrating inflammatory monocytes as the primary driver of this hippocampal pathology, but the mechanisms involved in recruiting these cells to the brain were unclear. Methods: Chemokine expression levels in the hippocampus were assessed by microarray, ELISA, RT-PCR, and immunofluorescence. Monocyte infiltration during acute TMEV infection was measured by flow cytometry. CCL2 levels were manipulated by immunodepletion and by specific removal from neurons in mice generated by crossing a line expressing the Cre recombinase behind the synapsin promoter to animals with floxed CCL2. Results: Inoculation of the brain with TMEV induced hippocampal production of the proinflammatory chemokine CCL2 that peaked at 6 hours postinfection, whereas inoculation with UV-inactivated TMEV did not elicit this response. Immunofluorescence revealed that hippocampal neurons expressed high levels of CCL2 at this timepoint. Genetic deletion of CCR2 and systemic immunodepletion of CCL2 abrogated or blunted the infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during acute infection. Specific genetic deletion of CCL2 from neurons reduced serum and hippocampal CCL2 levels and inhibited inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain. Conclusions: We conclude that intracranial inoculation with infectious TMEV rapidly induces the expression of CCL2 in neurons, and this cellular source is necessary for CCR2-dependent infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during the most acute stage of encephalitis. These findings highlight a unique role for neuronal production of chemokines in the initiation of leukocytic infiltration into the infected central nervous system.",

            "text": "Neural injury associated with virus infection represents a multifaceted convergence of hostpathogen interactions that range from direct lytic killing of infected neurons to bystander pathology mediated by brain-infiltrating immune cells responding to chemotactic and inflammatory cues. Viral encephalitis is a trade-off between the need to clear pathogen from the brain and the need to preserve irreplaceable neurons and neural circuits: too little inflammation and the host dies of uncontrolled infection, too much inflammation and the host suffers permanent brain damage [1] . And while much attention is rightly given to viral encephalitides associated with human mortality, there is likely a significant component of neural injury associated with low-level, sub-clinical viral infections of the central nervous system that are ultimately cleared by the host. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) is a model of such an infection [2] . When C57Bl/6 mice are inoculated via intracranial delivery of the Daniel's strain of TMEV there is an acute viral encephalitis that culminates in generation of an antiviral T cell-mediated response, development of virus neutralizing antibodies, clearance of the virus, and resolution of brain inflammation over the course of about 45 days [3] . However, despite essentially complete resolution of the infection, permanent neurological sequelae such as impaired spatial learning [2, 4] , anxiety [5] , and epilepsy [6] occur in most post-infectious animals. Uniquely, these neurologic problems largely stem from bystander loss of CA1 pyramidal neurons and subsequent disruption of hippocampal and hippocampal-cortical circuits [4, 7, 8] .",

We showed that animals which mount a large inflammatory monocyte response exhibit extensive loss of CA1 neurons in the dorsal hippocampus and lose the ability to learn spatial navigation and novel object recognition tasks. In contrast, mice that mount a weak inflammatory monocyte response exhibit preservation of CA1 neurons and maintain cognitive performance, despite robust virus infection [8] . In parallel, others have shown that monocyte-derived inflammatory factors such as interleukin-6 [9, 10] and tumor necrosis factor-a [11] drive ictogenesis in the TMEV model. These observations suggest that modulation of inflammatory monocyte responses during acute virus infection in the brain may confer neuroprotection. However, the specific mechanisms responsible for the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes to the brain in the TMEV model have not been previously characterized and open questions remain regarding the mechanisms of leukocyte infiltration into the brain in general.",

            "text": "The multistep process of leukocyte entry into the central nervous system is predominantly controlled by chemokines [12] . In particular, inflammatory monocyte trafficking is thought to depend upon C-C motif chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) signaling in response to C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) [13] , though the specific details of this dependency vary with viral pathogen. For example, CCR2-deficient mice exhibited reduced monocyte recruitment to the brain but increased mortality during West Nile virus encephalitis [14] and this effect was differentially regulated by CCL2 and CCL7, another CCR2 ligand [15] . In a model of Japanese encephalitis virus infection, mice deficient in CCR2 had reduced monocyte infiltration and reduced mortality, whereas CCL2-deficient animals exhibited increased monocyte infiltration and increased mortality [16] . Both CCL2-and CCR2-deficient mice with mouse hepatitis virus encephalitis had reduced monocyte infiltration, but only CCR2-deficient mice exhibited increased mortality [17, 18] . Likewise, mice with CCR2-deficient hematopoietic cells mounted a reduced monocyte response to herpes simplex virus 1 infection and exhibited increased mortality [19] . These studies clearly support a role for the CCR2:CCL2 axis in trafficking of inflammatory monocytes to the brain during viral encephalitis. However, the specific cellular source of the CCL2 is not identified in any of this work. In the current study we demonstrate that inflammatory monocyte infiltration into the brain during acute TMEV infection requires CCR2 and that neurons are a key source of CCL2 driving this trafficking during the earliest stages of infection.",

Fluorescence images were captured with a laser scanning confocal microscope (LSM780, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) using a 40x objective (C-Apochromat 40x/1.20 W Korr FCS M27, 1.2 NA) with water as the refractive medium. Validation of mCherry-specific emission and exclusion of autofluorescence was obtained with spectral imaging using a lambda scan at 488 nm, 561 nm, and 594 nm excitation and 8 nm-stepped emission spectra. 40 \u00b5m z-stacks were acquired with a step thickness of 2 \u00b5m, pixel dwell time of 0.39 \u00b5s, and pinhole equivalent to 1 airy unit across all samples. Uncompressed TIFF-images were exported from Zen software (Zen Black 2012 64-bit, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) and post-processed in ImageJ (ImageJ v1.50b, Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health, USA) and Photoshop (Adobe Photoshop CC, 2014 Release, 64-bit). Levels were normalized, when appropriate, equally across images and groups; gamma values were not changed.",

            "text": "Adult female C57Bl/6 mice were intracranially inoculated with 2x10 5 PFU of TMEV. RNA from hippocampus was prepared at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hours postinfection (hpi) and analyzed by microarray to measure changes in transcripts. Hippocampal RNA was also prepared from uninfected mice and from mice 24 hours after sham inoculation with viral growth media. Fold changes in expression for the 16900 genes present on the array were calculated relative to uninoculated/uninfected controls. A heat map of log 2 fold change ( Figure 1A ) reveals that numerous genes were already upregulated at 3 hpi and the number of upregulated genes steadily grew through the first 24 hours after infection. Extraction of chemokine, cytokine, and adhesion factor genes ( Figure 1B ) indicates that these pathways were robustly impacted by TMEV infection. For example, the CCR2 ligand CCL2 was upregulated 8-fold by 3 hpi and continued to increase to almost 50-fold induction by 12 hpi, remaining above 30-fold at 24 hpi. The CCR5 ligand CCL5 increased steadily from 5-fold at 3 hpi to over 60-fold by 24 hpi and the CCR2 ligand CCL7 increased from 8-fold at 3 hpi to over 80-fold at 24 hpi. Likewise, the CXCR2 ligand CXCL1 was upregulated over 150-fold at 3 hpi, decreasing to 20-fold by 24 hpi, while CXCL2 was upregulated 10-fold at 3 hpi and decreased slightly to 6-fold by 24 hpi. The CX3CR1 ligand CX3CL1 was not increased at these timepoints and was, in fact, modestly downregulated by 1.4-fold at 3 hpi. In parallel with changes in chemokine expression, we observed marked upregulation of adhesion factors, with ICAM-1 upregulated 12-fold at 3 hpi, decreasing to 6-fold by 24 hpi, and VCAM-1 upregulated between 4-and 5-fold at each timepoint. Other adhesion factors involved in leukocyte trafficking were either unregulated (CD34), downregulated (Selectin-P ligand, 2-fold), or modestly upregulated (MAdCAM-1, 2-fold; GlyCAM-1, over 2-fold). Finally, a subset of immune genes were validated by RT-PCR ( Figure  1C ), confirming the general pattern of expression revealed by the microarray though with greater dynamic range. For example, by RT-PCR we measured a 260-fold induction of CCL2 at 3 hpi that continued to increase to over 2000-fold upregulation by 12 hpi. Overall, we conclude that inoculation of the brain with TMEV induces rapid and robust upregulation of proinflammatory chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion factors in the hippocampus that can be detected as early as 3 hours after injection.",

To measure the production of this chemokine in the CNS, separate animals were perfused with PBS to remove circulating factors and whole brain was homogenized for ELISA ( Figure 2B ). As with the serum, CCL2 was robustly detected at 3 hpi, at levels in excess of 4000 pg per brain, and decreased sharply at 6 hpi ( Figure 2B ). However, in contrast to serum, the brain levels rose again at 12 hpi and reached levels comparable to the 3 hpi values by 24 hpi. Based on our previous findings regarding the locus of neuronal injury during acute TMEV infection [7, 22] , we also measured CCL2 in microdissected hippocampus at the same timepoints in separate animals ( Figure 2C ). CCL2 levels peaked at 6 hpi and were measured at 1500 pg per mouse (hippocampi pooled for each individual animal). Notably, this amount of CCL2 represents approximately the same amount of CCL2 measured in the whole brain at this timepoint ( Figure 2B ), suggesting that the hippocampus is the primary site for production at 6 hpi. Finally, to separate non-infectious pathogen recognition receptor-mediated effects from chemokine induction triggered by infectious virus, especially within the context of the very rapid response following inoculation, we compared the levels of CCL2 in the whole brain at 3 hr after inoculation with UV-inactivated TMEV or live TMEV. In this experiment we measured 3010 \u00b1 425 pg/brain with live virus, 176 \u00b1 65 pg/brain with dead virus, and 88 \u00b1 16 pg/brain in sham mice (live vs dead: P<0.001; live vs sham: P<0.001; dead vs sham: P=0.703; by one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's pairwise comparison). We conclude that inoculation with infectious TMEV induces the rapid production of CCL2 in the brain and particularly in the hippocampus.",

To our surprise, immunostaining for CCL2 in uninfected mice revealed weak fluorescence associated with the pyramidal neurons of CA1, CA3, and the dentate gyrus (DG) ( Figure 2D ). At higher magnification this signal, not present in the secondary-only controls (not shown), exhibited a diffuse pattern associated with the cell layers ( Figure 2G ). At 6 hpi we consistently observed a robust increase in expression of CCL2 in pyramidal neuron cell bodies in the CA1, CA3, and DG regions ( Figure 2E ). In addition, there was a clear increase in immunofluorescence in the terminal networks of the apical dendrites located in the stratum lacunosum moleculare ( Figure 2E , 2H). This observation is notable because we have previously reported that the hippocampal fissure, located just below the stratum lacunosum moleculare, is a primary site for infiltration of inflammatory monocytes [4]. Finally, the overall signal intensity faded by 24 hpi, though the pyramidal neuron layerassociated signal was more punctate and brighter than the earlier diffuse pattern ( Figure 2F , 2I). Whether some of this signal was associated with infiltrating monocytes was not resolved in this experiment. These observations suggest that the 6 hpi peak in hippocampal CCL2 measured by ELISA ( Figure 2C ) was the result of production by hippocampal neurons.",

In wildtype mice at 18 hpi we observed robust populations of all three cell types ( Figure 3A , 3C), with inflammatory monocytes making up about 25% of the total CD45 + population ( Figure 3E ). In the absence of CCR2 expression there was marked suppression of inflammatory monocyte infiltration and a relative increase in neutrophil recruitment, with no change in microglia ( Figure 3B, 3D) . Indeed, inflammatory monocytes were reduced to less than 3% of total CD45 + cells (WT vs CCR2ko: P=0.0004 by Dunnett's method; Figure 3E ).

The parental Ccl2-RFP flox/flox animals serve as a reporter line for CCL2 expression, and analysis of RFP fluorescence in mice at 6 hpi confirmed the CA1 neuronal expression of this chemokine ( Figure 5A, 5B) . Analysis of the Ccl2-RFP flox/flox x Syn-Cre conditional knockouts at the same timepoint revealed that CCL2 was specifically deleted from the CA1 neurons ( Figure 5C, 5D) . Serum was terminally isolated from Ccl2-RFP flox/flox and Ccl2-RFP flox/flox x Syn-Cre mice inoculated with TMEV and CCL2 was measured by ELISA ( Figure 5E ). The large increase in circulating CCL2 observed at 6 hpi in Ccl2-RFP flox/flox mice was not detected in the Ccl2-RFP flox/flox x Syn-Cre mice (F=35.9565, P<0.0001 by two-way ANOVA; -CCL2 vs +CCL2 at 6 hpi: P<0.0001 by Tukey-Kramer pairwise analysis). However, by 24 hpi the serum levels were the same in both groups (-CCL2 vs +CCL2 at 24 hpi: P=0.9677 by Tukey-Kramer)( Figure 2E ).

Despite differences in nomenclature, host genetics, and details of the viral strain and inoculum, a general consensus has emerged that monocytic cells infiltrate the brain within hours of infection and create an inflammatory environment that kills neurons and alters neural circuitry.

            "text": "Not surprisingly, intracranial inoculation with TMEV induced a robust inflammatory program in the hippocampus, involving upregulation of dozens of chemokine, cytokine, and adhesion factor genes ( Figure 1 ). Somewhat surprising, however, was the speed with which this induction occurred. We reproducibly detected large changes in transcription by 3 hpi, and in some experiments measured variable, but sizable, induction of chemokines and cytokines by 1 hpi (not shown). Moreover, these factors were detected at the protein level over the same acute period, with CCL2 measurable in the serum and brain as early as 1 hpi (not shown). Not only are these responses fast with regard to biosynthesis, but it is unlikely that a significant number of cells have even been infected in the brain by 3 hpi. Mathematical modeling constrains the infection rate to only 0.01 to 0.1 cells per minute [26] , suggesting that fewer than 20 cells would be productively infected by 3 hpi. Even if this rate is off by a factor of 100, fewer than 2000 cells are infected by 3 hpi. Obviously, some cells can respond to virions and virus constituents via mechanisms that do not require active infection, such as pathogen (or pattern) recognition receptors [27] , but our findings indicate that inoculation with UV-inactivated virus did not elicit CCL2 production in the brain at 3 hpi. This finding also rules out induction via non-specific trauma-induced effects associated with intracranial inoculation. Moreover, even assuming a direct effect of each active virion on target cells, we only inoculated the animals with 200,000 plaque forming units and these were not introduced directly into the hippocampus [20] . Yet, at 6 hpi the hippocampus produced essentially all of the CCL2 measured in the brain and presumably contributed the majority of serum CCL2. This issue is further confounded by the pattern of CCL2 expression revealed by immunostaining, which shows that effectively every neuron in dorsal hippocampal CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus expressed this factor at 6 hpi ( Figure 2 ). As we have previously reported, even by 3 dpi only a fraction of CA1 neurons are directly infected with TMEV and DG neurons are never positive for virus by immunostaining [22] . These observations and discrepancies suggest that a currently unidentified amplification event occurs almost immediately after inoculation with live virus that results in widespread, albeit tissue-specific, upregulation of CCL2 production. Furthermore, this induction occurs almost exclusively in neurons, as synapsin-promoter driven deletion of CCL2 results in nearly complete suppression of both hippocampal and serum CCL2 at 6 hpi.",

Notably, deletion of CCL2 from neurons recapitulates the effect of systemic deletion in mice treated with anti-CCL2 immunoglobulin ( Figure 6F compared to Figure 4D ) -the inflammatory monocyte infiltrate is reduced by about 70% in both conditions at 18-24 hpi. Presumably, the remaining infiltrate in both experiments is CCL7-dependent, although the cellular source of this other CCR2 ligand is currently unknown. These findings suggest an intriguing maladaptive response: neurons respond to brain inoculation with TMEV by producing copious amounts of a chemokine that serves to recruit the inflammatory monocytes into the brain that ultimately kill those same neurons [4] . While the current study does not address the impact of a curtailed monocyte response on viral clearance or eventual lymphocyte recruitment, anecdotal evidence indicates that CCR2 -/mice do not succumb to lethal infection and, indeed, do not show any apparent adverse effects at later timepoints (out to several months).

            "text": "Maintaining the focus on the most acute response to TMEV infection rather than downstream sequelae, several notable findings arise from the current study. First, genetic deletion of CCR2 in all cells almost entirely abrogates inflammatory monocyte infiltration at 18 hpi but actually increases neutrophil infiltration at this timepoint. This suggests that in the context of life-long absence of CCL2:CCR2 signaling neutrophil responses are not compromised by the absence of an inflammatory monocyte response. Second, acute systemic immunodepletion of CCL2 reduces inflammatory monocyte infiltration by 70% but also reduces neutrophil infiltration by more than half. This suggests that acute inhibition of the CCL2:CCR2 axis either impacts neutrophil recruitment directly (for example, brain infiltrating neutrophils express CCR2 and respond to CCL2) or via an indirect effect on monocyte-to-neutrophil communication (for example, infiltrating monocytes release neutrophilic chemokines) [28] . Third, systemic immunodepletion of CCL7 blocks about 30% of monocyte infiltration but has no impact on neutrophils. This indicates that if brain infiltrating neutrophils use a CCR2-dependent trafficking pathway it is not responsive to CCL7 or that the CCL7-dependent brain-infiltrating monocytes are not responsible for creating the pro-neutrophil environment. While speculative, this may suggest that there are at least two functional subtypes of CCR2 + brain-infiltrating monocytes that can be distinguished by CCL2 vs CCL7 responsiveness. Fourth, the CCL2-RFP fl/fl reporter line exhibits a trend toward increased neutrophil infiltration as compared to B6 mice. While not statistically significant due to the spread in values, this increase was visually evident in most of the mice, suggesting caution in studies analyzing leukocytic responses in these animals. Fifth, the robust inhibition of monocyte infiltration in the neuron-specific CCL2-deficient mice argues explicitly that this chemokine drives trafficking to the brain while side-stepping all of the issues regarding monocytopenia that arise in CCL2 -/or CCR2 -/mice. This is in contrast to the reported role of CCR2 in West Nile virus encephalitis [14] but is consistent with the brain trafficking role described by Graham and colleagues in a Semliki Forest virus model [29] . Sixth, manipulation of either CCL2 or CCR2 drove the inflammatory monocyte response in the same direction -down. This is in contrast to observations in a Japanese encephalitis model, in which CCR2 -/mice had reduced monocyte infiltration while CCL2 -/mice had a paradoxical increase in this population in the brain [16] . Of note, however, our manipulation of CCL2 was via acute immunodepletion, not life-long genetic deletion.",

            "text": "The production of CCL2 by neurons during acute encephalitis may play a role in more than just leukocyte recruitment. For example, hippocampal neurons express CCR2 [21] and CCL2 directly enhances both NMDA receptor-and AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials [30] . This suggests that the earliest stages of hippocampal circuit dysregulation associated with acute TMEV infection may be triggered locally by neuronal CCL2 acting in a autocrine fashion [31, 32] . In this context, it is notable that CCL2 immunoreactivity is strongly upregulated in CA1 neuron apical dendrite tufts located in the stratum lacunosum moleculare at 6 hr after infection (Figure 2 ). This layer is an important site of integration between the entorhinal cortex and CA1 pyramidal neurons (the perforant pathway) and is of fundamental importance to spatial and episodic memory formation [33] . It is also the site of GABAergic interneurons that are strongly activated by both entorhinal cortex and CA3-derived Schaffer collateral inputs [34] . These interneurons exhibit both AMPA receptor and NMDA receptor excitatory postsynaptic potentials [35] and are maximally activated at the theta oscillation peak and at the gamma oscillation trough [36] . These cells appear to mediate a robust feedforward inhibition that controls the size and timing of excitatory inputs onto CA1 neurons [37] and synchronizes network firing to theta frequency [34, 36] . Given the important role for hippocampal theta oscillations in learning and memory [38] , it is likely that acute production of CCL2 in the stratum lacunosum moleculare would disrupt cognitive performance. It is also notable that neuronal CCL2 production has been observed following kainic acid- [39] and pilocarpine-mediated seizure induction [40] in rodents and both CCL2 and CCR2 are increased in tissue resected from humans with intractable epilepsy [41, 42] . Inhibition of either CCL2 production or CCR2 signaling suppressed seizures in a mouse model of systemic inflammation and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy [43] . Indeed, Caleo and colleagues have recently suggested that CCL2 \"may act as a master regulator of inflammatory processes in the epileptic brain by both directly promoting hyperexcitability and regulating the activity of downstream inflammatory effectors\" [43]. Our findings echo this concept and add a third role in which hyperacute neuronal CCL2 production mediates CCR2-dependent inflammatory monocyte trafficking into the brain, resulting in the creation of an environment that further disrupts neural function and induces pyramidal neuron death [4, 7] .",

            "text": "Overall, we conclude that infection of the brain with TMEV rapidly induces CCL2 expression in neurons and this cellular source is central to driving CCR2-dependent infiltration of inflammatory monocytes into the brain during the most acute stage of encephalitis. While the relevance of our current findings to the neuropathological and electrophysiological sequelae of TMEV encephalitis remains to be determined, our observations lend further support to the therapeutic relevance of targeting the CCL2:CCR2 axis to confer neuroprotection. Our findings also highlight a unique role for neuronal production of chemokines in the initiation of leukocytic infiltration into the infected central nervous system. Hippocampal tissue was collected for RNA purification at early timepoints following intracranial inoculation of adult female C57Bl/6 mice with 2x10 5 PFU of the Daniel's strain of TMEV. Transcriptional changes were analyzed using Illumina MouseWG-6 v2.0 beadchips. Foldchange relative to uninfected control for 16900 genes present on the array was calculated, converted to log 2 , and heatmapped using Gitools. Sham controls were injected intracranially with culture media used for the virus preparation and RNA was collected at 24 h postinfection (hpi). Expression data for all conditions except sham are the means from 6 individual mice analyzed in two separate experiments (3 mice per experiment). Three sham mice were analyzed in the second experiment. (A) Heatmap showing pattern of transcriptional changes at 3, 6, 12, and 24 hpi relative to uninfected controls. The discontinuity in expression coding is the result of removing from analysis all genes with changes between -1.2-fold and +1.2-fold at 24 hpi, leaving 6764 genes in the heatmap. Color-coded heatmaps range from >8-fold downregulated (log 2 <-3.0; blue) to >8-fold upregulated (log 2 >+3.0; red). (B) The same expression data remapped to highlight chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion factors. In contrast to (A), values are continuous between -8-fold and +8-fold. Note that the color range was selected to reveal weaker changes in some genes, resulting in saturation at all timepoints for highly upregulated genes such as CCL2. (C) A further subset of highly upregulated and notable genes was validated by RT-PCR and the results heatmapped on a scale from 0 to 1000-fold (log 2 =+10) to reveal large expression changes over the first 12 hours.",
