An initial sputum culture was negative, as was sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear. On the third hospital day, her general condition and hypoxia deteriorated on a facial mask with an oxygen flow rate of 8 L/min and sustained fever was observed. She was transferred to the intensive care unit and a high flow nasal cannula was applied. Antibiotics were switched to meropenem and vancomycin. Flexible bronchoscopy for microbial evaluation showed no apparent endobronchial lesions. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed in the right middle lobe revealed a white blood cell count of 2,457/mm 3 (segmented neutrophils, 68%; lymphocytes, 27%; other cells, 5%), red blood cell count of 378/mm 3 , CD4/CD8 ratio of 0.8, no bacteria, viruses, or fungi, and negative AFB smear. All virus PCR and microbial tests, including blood and urine cultures, were negative. On the 7 th hospital day, her chest radiography was more aggravated (Figure 2A) , and percutaneous needle biopsy (PCNB) was performed for right middle lobe lesion. The PCNB specimen showed OP with non-necrotizing epithelioid cell granuloma ( Figure 2B ).

On the 12 th hospital day, culture-positive (liquid culture media) for nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) was noted in her BAL fluid and sputum AFB. Finally, M. abscessus was reported on the 25 th hospital day. A drug susceptibility test revealed that the isolate was susceptible to clarithromycin [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), \u22640.5 \u03bcg/mL], and showed intermediate susceptibility to amikacin and cefoxitin (MIC \u226432 \u03bcg/mL, both). The empirical antibiotic therapy was stopped, and she was started on intravenous amikacin, cefoxitin, and oral azithromycin. After 8 weeks of the antimycobacterial therapy with prednisolone, improvement was detected on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and radiologic images (Figure 3) . She was discharged on hospital day 60 with a recommendation to continue oral azithromycin, and to taper the prednisolone dose over 6 months.",

Another consideration was a hot tub lung that in an uncommon presentation of NTM lung disease. Hot tub lung as a hypersensitivity-like disease is similar to hypersensitivity pneumonitis with respect to its clinical and radiological presentation. The typical chest CT findings of hot tub lung are centrilobular nodules and/or groundglass opacities (7, 11, 12) , which are largely different from the infiltrating consolidation with air bronchogram seen in the present case. The CD4/CD8 ratio in the BAL fluid of hot tub lung patients is generally high (11) , whereas that of cryptogenic OP patients tends to be lower than 1 (13, 14) . These findings are also inconsistent with hot tub lung.",

Several recent studies regarding treatment outcome in M. abscessus complex lung disease have been reported, with positive results ranging from 25% to 88% (15) (16) (17) .

To the best of our knowledge, M. abscessus lung disease accompanying OP has not been described in the English language literature, with the exception of only one case diagnosed with bronchial washing and TBLB (6) . Pulmonary M. abscessus infection can present different clinicopathological features according to the various immune responses of the host. Respiratory physicians should be aware that pulmonary M. abscessus infection can develop simultaneous OP with ARF and should make conscientious effort to identify organisms causing unusual lung infections.",
