The innate immune response serves as the first line of defense against invading pathogens and relies on the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by several classes of pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing gene family (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) (Goubau et al., 2013; Paludan and Bowie, 2013; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010) . Activation of most TLRs leads to the recruitment of a common adaptor molecule, MyD88, which acts on a series of downstream signaling molecules to trigger the NF-kB pathway (Goubau et al., 2013; Hayden and Ghosh, 2008; Paludan and Bowie, 2013) , whereas stimulation of TLR7 and TLR9 in specialized plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can trigger robust MyD88-dependent IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 7 transcription factor-mediated type I IFN signaling and produce large amounts of IFN-a and IFN-b (IFN-a/b) in response to viral infection (Liu, 2005; Wang et al., 2011) . By contrast, activation of cytosolic RNA sensors (RIG-I and MDA5) recruits the mitochondrial antiviralsignaling protein (MAVS) adaptor protein, while stimulation of DNA sensors recruits stimulator of IFN genes (STING), which both result in triggering IRF3-mediated type I IFN signaling (Goubau et al., 2013; Paludan and Bowie, 2013; Sun et al., 2013; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010) . Innate immune responses must be tightly regulated to maintain immune balance, but how these signaling pathways are regulated in vivo, particularly in response to malaria infection, remains unresolved.",

High serum amounts of IFN-a/b in these genetically deficient mice were abolished upon depletion of pDC or ablation of Tlr7, Myd88, and Irf7. Our experiments further revealed that the STING-and MAVS-mediated type I IFN pathway induced SOCS1 expression, which potently inhibited MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling in pDCs. Furthermore, we showed that early robust IFN-a/b production by pDCs in genetically ablated mice during the first 24 hr of YM infection subsequently activated cDCs and macrophages, which, in turn, induced T-and B-cellmediated adaptive immune responses against malaria infection.",

IRF3 is a key factor for stimulating type I IFN signaling for IFN-b production in almost all cell types, whereas IRF7 is responsible for activating type I IFN signaling to produce IFN-a/b only in pDCs (Liu, 2005; Wang et al., 2011) .

We found that both purified YM gDNA and RNA could induce IFN-b mRNA expression in RAW264.7 cells ( Figure S1G ), which is in agreement with other studies showing that malaria RNA can be detected by a MDA5 sensor (Liehl et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2014) . As expected, in vitro stimulation with YM gDNA or RNA showed impaired or completely abolished activation of IFN-b mRNA and protein in bone-marrow-derived conventional DCs (cDCs) from MDA5-, MAVS-, and STING-deficient mice compared to cDCs from WT mice ( Figure S1H ). Although STING has been shown to play an important role in the host response to AT-rich malarial DNA (Sharma et al., 2011) , it is not clear which DNA sensors are responsible for recognizing YM gDNA and activating STINGmediated type I IFN signaling. To this end, we transfected 293T-STING stable cells with plasmids containing the gene encoding one of four putative DNA sensors (cGAS, DAI, DDX41, or IFI16) followed by YM gDNA stimulation. Ectopic expression of Mb21d1, but not Zbp1, Ddx41, or Ifi203, induced IFN-b mRNA expression after YM gDNA treatment ( Figure 1J ). Consistently, silencing of Mb21d1, but not Zbp1, Ddx41, or Ifi203, by specific siRNAs in RAW264.7 cells markedly reduced IFN-b mRNA and protein after YM gDNA treatment ( Figures 1K, 1L , and S1I), suggesting that cGAS functions as a DNA sensor for detecting YM gDNA and inducing STING-mediated type I IFN signaling.",

Although anti-IFNAR1 treatment did not have much effect on the production of IFN-a/b, IFN-g, and IL-6 in Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure S2A ), the Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt mice treated with anti-IFNAR1 antibody with a single injection at 1 day before infection (i.e., day \u00c01) or four injections at days \u00c01, 2, 4, and 6 showed increased parasitemias and died around day 15 ( Figures 2C, 2D , and S2B), suggesting that the IFN-a/b-mediated downstream signaling pathway is critical in controlling parasitemia and host mortality. To further test whether IFN-a/b-induced immunity requires IFNAR and its downstream signaling, we infected Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with YM and found comparable low amounts of IFN-a/b, IL-6, and IFN-g in serum compared with those in WT mice ( Figure S2C ). Whereas WT mice treated with exogenous recombinant IFN-a/b became resistant to YM infection, Ifnar1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice with recombinant IFN-a/b did not reduce parasitemia and mortality ( Figure S2D ), indicating that IFNAR is required for IFN-a/b-mediated protective immunity against YM infection.",

We first asked whether ablation of the Tlr7, Myd88, or Irf7 gene could reduce IFN-a/b production and reverse the resistant phenotypes of Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt mice to YM infection. To test this possibility, we generated Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 :Myd88 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 :Myd88 \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt :Myd88 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice and then infected them, along with WT, Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt mice, with YM. As expected, serum amounts of IFN-a/b were very high in Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt mice.

Consistent with these data, MyD88 ablation sensitized Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt mice to high parasitemia and host lethality (Figures 3B, S3C, and S3D) . These results suggest that the rapid production of high amounts of IFN-a/b in the Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt mice after YM infection is MyD88 dependent.",

Taken together, these results suggest that TLR7-MyD88-IRF7 molecules constitute key components of MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling, which has been shown to operate in only pDC for production of large amounts of IFN-a/b after viral infection (Liu, 2005; Wang et al., 2011) .",

To this end, we infected WT mice with YM and isolated cDCs, macrophages, and pDCs at 18 hr post infection to detect malaria 18S rRNA by PCR with malaria-specific primers. We found that malaria 18S rRNA could be detected in pDCs, but not in macrophages and cDCs ( Figure S4A ), suggesting that only pDCs are involved in detecting YM infection within the first 18 hr. To directly demonstrate that pDCs are the major source of type I IFN cytokine production, we depleted pDCs in WT, Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt mice by injection of mPDCA-1 antibody at 12 hr before and 12 hr after YM infection. Depletion of pDCs significantly reduced serum amounts of IFN-a/b in WT and deficient mice compared with control antibody treatment ( Figure 4A ). Similar results were obtained in Mb21d1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure S4B ), suggesting that IFN-a/b are primarily produced by pDCs. Importantly, pDC depletion by mPDCA-1 treatment markedly increased parasitemias and mortality in Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt mice infected with YM compared with control antibody-treated mice ( Figures 4B and 4C) . These results clearly suggest that pDCs are responsible for the early and rapid production of type I IFN in the Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt mice, which, in turn, activates type I IFN downstream signaling for potent innate immunity against YM infection.",

To test this possibility, we examined the expression pattern of several negative regulators in splenocytes from YM-infected WT and deficient mice, and found that the mRNA amounts of Socs1, Socs3, Inpp5d (coding for SHIP1), and Inppl1 (coding for SHIP2) were markedly increased in WT but were little or low in MDA5-, MAVS-, and STING-deficient splenocytes (Figures 5A and S5A) . Downregulation of Socs1 was also observed in cGAS-deficient mice ( Figure S5B ). By contrast, we did not observe appreciable changes in the expression of other potential negative regulators, such as Otud5, Gsk3b, Nlrc3, Pcbp2, Ube3c, and Rnf5, between YM-infected WT and deficient mice ( Figure S5A ). To further assess the expression of these negative regulators in pDCs, we purified pDCs from Flt3L-induced bonemorrow-derived DCs of WT and deficient mice by flow cytometry ( Figure S5C ) and then stimulated them with YM RNA or gDNA.

No appreciable differences in expression of other negative regulators Socs3, Inpp5d, and Inppl1 were observed between WT and deficient pDCs after YM RNA or gDNA stimulation ( Figure S5D ). To further substantiate these findings, we purified pDCs, macrophages, and cDCs from YMinfected WT and Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (18 hr after infection) and then directly assessed SOCS1 expression in these cells, and we found that SOCS1 mRNA abundance in pDCs from WT mice were significantly higher than pDCs from Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 mice (Figure 5D) . Notably, we did not detect any difference in expression of SOCS1 in macrophages and cDCs from WT and Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figure 5D ). Importantly, SOCS1 mRNA abundance was inversely correlated with IFN-a/b mRNA and protein expression in pDCs from YM-infected WT and Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 mice ( Figures 5E and  5F ). Similar results were obtained using purified pDCs, cDCs, and macrophages treated in vitro with YM-iRBCs ( Figures S5E  and S5F ).",

Although previous studies showed that SOCS1 inhibits the NF-kB signaling pathway by interacting with IRAK1 (Nakagawa et al., 2002) , the involvement of SOCS1 in MyD88-mediated type I IFN signaling is not known. To determine whether SOCS1 directly interacts with MyD88, we performed co-immunoprecipitation of 293T cells expressing Socs1 plus Myd88, Irak1, or Irak4, and we found that SOCS1 directly interacted with MyD88 ( Figure 5G ), in addition to IRAK1. To determine whether STING-, MDA5-, and MAVS-induced SOCS1 are responsible for inhibition of MyD88-dependent type I IFN production in pDCs, we silenced Socs1, Socs3, Inpp5d, and Inppl1 in WT pDCs by siRNA transfection (Figure S6A ) and then determined IFN-a/b production after YM RNA and gDNA stimulation. Only silencing of Socs1 resulted in a significant increase in IFN-a/b mRNA, as well as IFN-b protein after YM RNA and gDNA stimulation ( Figures S6B and S6C) , suggesting that STING-or MAVS-mediated type I IFN signaling induces SOCS1 expression, which, in turn, inhibits MyD88dependent type I IFN production in pDCs.",

Due to neonatal mortality and the complex inflammatory pathology of Socs1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, the in vivo role of SOCS1 in response to malaria infection could not be addressed. Hence, (B and C) Expression of Socs1 in pDCs of WT and deficient (Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt ) mice after YM RNA (B) or gDNA (C) stimulation. (D) WT and Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were infected with YM for 18 hr. pDCs, cDCs, and macrophages were isolated and purified from infected mice and used for analysis of Socs1 mRNA expression by qPCR. (E and F) IFN-a/b expression at the mRNA (E) and protein (F) amounts in pDCs, cDCs, or macrophages from WT and Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 mice after overnight culture. (G) SOCS1 interacts with MyD88 and IRAK1. 293T cells were transfected with HA-Socs1 and Flag-Irak1, Flag-Irak4, or Flag-Myd88. Immunoprecipitation was performed with an anti-Flag, followed by immunoblotting with an anti-HA or anti-Flag antibody. Whole-cell lysates were immunoblotted for protein expression. Data are plotted as the mean \u00b1 SD and are representative of three independent experiments. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 versus corresponding control. NS, not significant. ND, not detected. See also Figures S5 and S6. we first silenced the Socs1 gene in WT mice with Socs1-specific siRNA ( Figures 6A and S6D ). As expected, silencing of Socs1 increased IFN-g production through its inhibitory effect on JAK1. We also found increased serum amounts of IFN-a/b compared with scrambled siRNA-treated WT mice after YM infection ( Figure 6B ). Importantly, silencing of Socs1 resulted in reduction of parasitemia and increased survival of WT mice after YM infection compared with control mice ( Figure 6C ). To further confirm these observations, we genetically ablated the Socs1 gene in WT bone marrow cells using the CRISPR/Cas9 system, and then we generated chimeric mice ( Figures S6E and S6F ). SOCS1-deficient chimeric mice produced high amounts of IFN-a/b, reduced parasitemia, and increased survival after YM infection ( Figures S6G and S6H) . These results suggest that silencing or genetic deletion of Socs1 relieves its inhibition of the MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway, thus leading to the control of parasitemia and host survival.",

We found that depletion of pDCs with anti-mPDCA-1 in Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 mice during the cytokine production phase (24 hr before infection) markedly reduced IFN-a/b production; however, depletion of pDCs after 24 hr of infection had no effect on IFN-a/b production compared with mice treated with a control antibody (Figure 7B) .

Macrophage depletion in Tmem173 gt mice did not affect serum amounts of IFN-a/b, regardless of depletion at 2 days before or 1 day after YM infection ( Figure 7D ). However, macrophage depletion during the effector phase (at 1 day post infection) markedly increased parasitemia and host mortality compared with a liposome control or treatment at 2 days before infection ( Figure 7E ), suggesting a critical role of macrophages during the effector phase, but not during the cytokine production phase. To determine the relative role of cDCs in anti-malaria immunity, we generated Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 :Zbtb46-DTR (zinc figure transcription factor-driven DTR expression in cDCs) mice. As expected in a previous study (Meredith et al., 2012) , DT injection into Zbtb46-DTR bone marrow chimeras resulted in specific depletion of cDCs in 12 hr and maintained depletion for 5 days. Thus, we injected DT into Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 :Zbtb46-DTR chimeric mice at 4 days before or at 1 day post infection. We found that there was no change in the serum amounts of IFN-a/b when DT was injected either before or after YM infection ( Figure 7F ), suggesting that cDCs are not responsible for the IFN-a/b production during the early phase (24 hr) of infection. However, Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 :Zbtb46-DTR mice treated with DT after 24 hr of infection showed increased parasitemia and died sooner after infection compared to untreated mice or mice treated with DT at 4 days before infection ( Figure 7G ), suggesting that cDCs are required for generating protective immunity during the effector phase. Consistent with these results, we also found that malaria 18S rRNA could be detected in pDCs, but not in macrophages or cDCs, at 18 hr post infection. However, malaria 18S rRNA could be detected in macrophages and cDCs of Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at day 3 post infection ( Figure S7B ), suggesting that pDCs are the major cell population that sense and detect YM infection within the first 24 hr, whereas macrophages and cDCs are involved in the detection of YM infection at later time points for the induction of adaptive immunity. Taken together, these results suggest that pDCs, but not macrophages or cDCs, are critically required for the production of IFN-a/b in the first 24 hr after YM infection, whereas macrophages and cDCs are required for IFN-a/ b-induced immunity against YM after 24 hr post infection.",

STING-deficient mice were more resistant to YM infection than were cGAS-deficient mice, suggesting that other DNA sensors might function in recognizing malarial genomic DNA. For RNA sensing, MDA5, but not RIG-I, is responsible for detecting malaria RNA and triggers MAVS-mediated type I IFN signaling. It is known that RIG-I recognizes RNA with a triphosphate (PPP) moiety and 5 0 blunt-ended 20 nucleotides, whereas MDA5 recognizes long dsRNA (1-2 kb) (Goubau et al., 2013) . These structural and length requirements of dsRNA may explain why malaria RNA interacts with MDA5, but not with RIG-I, to trigger downstream MAVS-dependent type I IFN signaling. Although cGAS-STING-and MDA5-MAVS-mediated type I IFN signaling is important and operates in all cell types, including macrophages and cDCs, we did not detect YM malaria 18S rRNA or observe IFN-b and SOCS1 expression in macrophages and cDCs within the first 18-24 hr post infection. Depletion of macrophages or cDCs did not affect the production of IFN-a/b at 24 hr post infection, further suggesting that macrophages and cDCs are not involved the production of IFN-a/b in the early stage of YM infection.",

Our results clearly demonstrate the requirement for pDCs in the production of IFN-a/b during the first 24 hr of infection, but not after that time. Conversely, depletion of macrophages or cDCs during the first 24 hr of infection affected neither IFN-a/b production nor parasitemia or host mortality in this YM model. However, depletion of macrophages or cDCs after 24 hr post infection resulted in increased parasitemia and host mortality, suggesting that these cell types participated in anti-malaria immunity, which is consistent with previous results showing that classic DCs are required for inducing T cell response (Voisine et al., 2010) . Although B cells and T cells are not required for IFN-a/b production and parasitemia control during the first 5-6 days post infection, they are required for the control of parasitemia and host mortality at later times (>6 days), as suggested by previous studies using cerebral malaria (Ball et al., 2013; Haque et al., 2014) .",

YM RNA activates TLR7 and recruits the downstream adaptor MyD88 to trigger IRF7-mediated type I IFN signaling pathway. However, previous studies show that mice deficient with STING, TBK1, IRF3 and IRF7, or IFNAR1 expression are resistant to P. berghei ANKA infection (Haque et al., 2014; Sharma et al., 2011) , suggesting that type I IFN impairs host anti-malaria responses to ANKA. To explain why type I IFN plays opposing roles in host immune responses to different malaria strain infection, we examined the timing and amounts of IFN-a/b production in response to two lethal Plasmodium strains (P. yoelii YM and P. berghei ANKA) and found that the timing and amounts of IFN-a/b production are different in WT mice in response to YM or ANKA infection: low amount of IFN-a/b only at day 1 after YM infection versus large amounts of IFN-a/b at day 4 after ANKA infection (Haque et al., 2014) . We propose that early robust production or administration of type I IFN (18-24 hr post infection) is essential to induce innate and adaptive immunity against malaria. By contrast, late time production of type I IFN (3-4 days after ANKA infection) impairs host anti-malaria immune responses. Thus, different malaria strains have evolved to evade host immune system by either inhibiting type I IFN production at the early infection phase (in YM strain) or shifting type I IFN production to the late time (4 days post infection) (in ANKA strain). Similar results have been obtained in LCMV infection or other pathogens (O'Connell et al., 2004; Teles et al., 2013; Wilson et al., 2013) . In these cases, persistent production of type I IFN even at day 9 post LCMV infection is observed, which, in turn, induces the expression of negative regulators, such as IL-10 and PD-L1, to inhibit adaptive immune response. Our study showed that robust type I IFN production (only at day 1) produced by pDCs activates cDCs and macrophages to induce adaptive immune response for the clearance of YM infection.",

            "text": "Our study identified SOCS1 as a key negative regulator, which interacted with MyD88 and inhibited MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling. A recent study shows a role for STING in negatively regulating inflammatory responses of macrophages in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) through upregulation of A20, SOCS1, and SOCS3 (Sharma et al., 2015) , but its role in MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling is not known in this disease model. We further showed that inactivation of Ifih1, Tmem173, or Mavs markedly reduced Socs1 expression in vitro and in vivo and increased IFN-a/b mRNA and protein expression. Silencing or genetic deletion of Socs1 in YM-infected WT mice markedly reduced parasitemia and host mortality. The predominant role of SOCS1 is to regulate MyD88dependent type I IFN signaling in pDCs because the observed increase in IFN-a/b expression after siRNA-mediated Socs1 silencing disappeared when pDCs were depleted, suggesting that Socs1 silencing mainly affects MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling in pDCs. Based on these findings, we propose a working model to illustrate how type I IFN is regulated in response to YM infection ( Figure S7C ). Activation of cGAS-STING and MDA5-MAVS by YM infection triggers IRF3-mediated type I IFN signaling in pDCs, which produce low amounts of IFN-a/b and activate negative regulator SOCS1 in WT pDCs. SOCS1 then inhibits MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway, which produces more than 100-fold higher cytokine amounts than those produced by STING-and MAVSmediated IRF3-dependent type I IFN signaling pathway. By contrast, SOCS1 expression is markedly reduced in Ifih1 \u00c0/\u00c0 , Mavs \u00c0/\u00c0 , and Tmem173 gt pDCs, allowing the activation of MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling. Thus, lethal YM infection activates two distinct type I IFN signaling pathways in pDCs. YM takes advantage of the cross-inhibition of TLR7-MyD88-mediated type I IFN signaling by cGAS-STING-and MDA5-MAVS-mediated type I IFN through upregulation of Socs1 in WT mice to avoid host innate immune response. Silencing or genetic ablation of genes, such as Socs1 or those in the STING-and MAVS-mediated type I IFN signaling pathway, relieves SOCS1-suppressive effects on TLR7-MyD88-mediated type I IFN signaling and permits robust production of IFN-a/b in the first 24 hr post infection, then activates downstream signaling pathways via IFNAR in other innate immune cells, such as macrophages and cDCs, for priming adaptive immunity mediated by B and T cells to clear YM infec-tion at later times. Thus, our findings not only identify a critical regulatory mechanism between different type I IFN signaling pathways in pDCs, as well as a critical role of stage-dependent type I IFN production and specific contribution of different immune cells for developing protective immunity, but also provide potential therapeutic targets for the development of safe and effective malaria vaccines.",
