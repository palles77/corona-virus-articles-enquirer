These surfaces are protected, in part, by local immune responses that share common features which reflect the adaptation of the immune response to the mucosal environment (Bienen stock and Befus, 1980 . For example, IgA is the predominant class of antibody in secretions whereas IgG makes up the largest proportion in serum. Furthermore, the migration pattern of mucosal immunoblasts dif fers from their systemic counterparts by having the propensity to accumu late selectively in mucosal tissues. The prevalence of IgA in secretions at mucosal surfaces and the selective traffic of \u03a4 and \u0392 immunoblasts among different mucosal tissues have led to the concept of a common mucosal immune system (McDermott and Bienenstock, 1979) .",

This is illustrated by the observations that intestinal mast cells in the rat differ in a variety of ways from those seen in other sites such as the peritoneum , and there is a predominance of IgA-committed \u0392 cells and IgA-selective regulatory cells in mucosal tis sues (Craig and Cebra, 1971; Tomasi, 1983 ) that help contribute to the high proportion of IgA in secretions. Thus, in order to clearly understand immunity in a mucosal tissue, one must utilize techniques to isolate cells from the tissue of interest and study them directly. This approach is preferable to developing models of mucosal immune reactivity by extrap olating from data obtained in studies of spleen or peripheral blood.",

The lumen contains a myriad of microbial and dietary antigens which are only separated from large populations of lymphocytes by the tight junctions of the absorptive epithelium. Furthermore, the epithelium is not an impenetrable barrier, so some antigenic molecules are constantly entering from the lumen. Thus, the interaction between antigen and \u03a4 or \u0392 cells must be regulated to facilitate preventive responses to infection while limiting the magnitude of the reaction so epithelial integrity and function are not impaired by inflam mation. Our lack of understanding of the immune responses in the intes tine hampers our ability to control the toll taken by intestinal diseases in human or veterinary medicine. Therefore, it is important to seek more knowledge of local immune mechanisms by isolating cells from the intes tine for direct study in order to enhance our ability to manipulate intesti nal responses and help control disease in this tissue. This new information could be applied in the prevention of intestinal infection or the control of aggressive immune responses that may contribute to intestinal diseases such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease (Ferguson, 1977; Ernst et al y 1986a) .",

The distribution and compartmentalization of cells in the intestine will be briefly reviewed before discussing their isolation. Methods will be described for the isola tion of cells from the different compartments in the intestine of the mouse and, in addition, procedures for the isolation of cells from rat and human will be included. By including information on cell isolation from these different species, one readily appreciates the similarities or differences among species. The emphasis will be on what investigations have been done on cells isolated from the epithelium or lamina propria and how proper isolation is important to permit sound conclusions to be drawn from the data regarding the different populations. The data presented will demonstrate not only the difference between sites in the body, but also the compartmentalization that exists in the intestine itself.",

Subsequently, particular functional or phenotypic subsets can be obtained, studied, and incorporated into a model of local immunity in health or disease. Currently, it is believed that leukocytes are primarily compartmentalized in the intestine in either spe cialized sites for antigen penetration or other areas where various effector functions predominate. The compartments include the Peyer's patches, the solitary lymphoid nodules, and the diffusely distributed leukocytes in the lamina propria or the intraepithelial region. These sites make up the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT).",

At least some of these different leuko cytes are located in more than one site in the GALT; however, their distribution and functions have not been as well studied in the lamina propria or epithelium due to the relative difficulty in isolating cells from these two compartments. It is known that polymorphonuclear cells are generally not found in the epithelium of healthy intestine but reside in the lamina propria, while mast cell precursors can be found in high frequency in both compartments. The selective distribution of these and other cells has profound influence on the function of a particular compartment.

            "text": "The Peyer's patches can easily be identified along the antimesenteric border of the small intestine of mice and rats; however, they are less frequently seen in humans. There are usually 6-12 patches visible in the small intestine of 4-to 6-week-old mice, and their size increases with age as they receive stimulation from lumenal antigen. They can be removed by an elliptical incision and forced through stainless-steel screens into growth medium such as RPMI. This technique tends to provide prepara tions with only 70% viability, and it also almost totally destroys the non specific esterase-positive cells and functional primary \u0392 cell responses in vitro . Thus, to increase yields of cells and enhance viability of preparations from Peyer's patches, enzymatic digests have been used. One technique includes three to four (30 minutes) digestions of excised Peyer's patches with Dispase (Boehringer Mannheim Kiyono et al., 1982) , whereas we have achieved excellent results (Ernst et al., 1987) with collagenase (Gibco) using a modification of a technique previously described by Richman et al. (1981b) . The en zyme is added to growth medium, and warmed to 37\u00b0C; the Peyer's patches are added to 30-50 ml of medium with the enzyme and then mixed at 37\u00b0C. The cell suspensions are pelleted and washed three times; they are then ready for use in an experiment. With either enzyme diges tion >98% of the cells are viable, and they are fully competent to undergo a primary immunization in vitro to generate antigen-specific B-cell re sponses . Such preparations yield roughly equal per centages of \u03a4 and \u0392 cells plus mononuclear cells that are responsible for antigen processing (Spalding et al., 1983) . Peyer's patch cells also have been cultured from immunized animals under conditions which select for \u03a4 cells, and various helper \u03a4 cell activities have been described in cells cultured in this fashion (Kawanishi et al., 1983; Kiyono et al, 1984) .",

Although there have been many descriptions of techniques for isolating the diffusely distributed cells from the mucosa of mice, rats, guinea pigs, or rabbits (described by Ernst et al., 1985a) , the most suc cessful attempts have several factors in common as outlined below.

(1982) and Davies and Parrott (1981a) , with modifications (Petit et al., 1985) , has been successful for our experiments and is applicable to differ ent strains of mice. Following the removal of the intestine from 5-10 mice, lumenal contents are flushed out; Peyer's patches are removed, and the gut is opened lengthwise. Pieces measuring 2-3 cm long are then incubated in Ca-and Mg-free Hanks' basal salt solution (HBSS) with 10~ 4 M EDTA (Tagliabue et al., 1982) . With this procedure, the epithelium and IEL can be separated from the lamina propria by two or three (15 minutes) incubations at 37\u00b0C with gentle mixing. This yields a mixture of viable IEL, viable epithelial cells, and dead cells (almost exclusively dead epithelium). Repeated washing is performed before rapid filtration through nylon wool columns to remove clumps of dead cells. Cells are washed again in HBSS and then in 30% Percoll (50 ml for five mice : Petit et al., 1985) . This step removes a great deal of mucus and dead cells, which can impair the yields and purity obtained in subsequent steps. The pellet from this is put onto a 50-ml discontinuous Percoll gradient, centrifuged, and cells harvested from the 55% (IEL55) and 70% (IEL70) Percoll fraction. These fractions include 50-55% of the cells put on the gradient, and 85-95% of these are leukocytes-at least 90% of which are derived from the epithelium versus the lamina propria (Ernst et al., 1986b) .",

Subsequently, using nylon wool, repeated washings, and gradients (Mayrhofer and Whately, 1983; Huntley et al., 1984) , the IEL can be separated. With techniques similar to those described above, IEL separation can be done without exces sively high concentration of EDTA, enzymes, or undue trauma, which may liberate more cells from the lamina propria (thereby contaminating the IEL preparation) or result in a decrease in functional activity (Chiba et al., 1981; Gibson et al., 1984) .

The technique is described in detail by Lee et al (1985) but is summarized as follows. The entire rat small intestine is removed and quickly flushed with saline at room temperature. After removal of the Peyer's patches and mesentery, the pieces of intestine are washed well in HBSS and then cut into small (1-2 mm) pieces to be incubated at 37\u00b0C in three (10 minutes) changes of HBSS with EDTA. Between each EDTA incubation, the tissue is washed quickly in HBSS to reduce mucus and debris. This is followed by two (1 hour) incubations at 37\u00b0C with collagenase (Gibco). Supernatants are col lected and filtered through gauze. The cells from the first collagenase incubation are discarded because of the presence of large numbers of eosinophils. After removal of cells from the supernatant of the second incubation by centrifugation, the remaining tissue is mechanically dis rupted by repeated syringing (-20 times with a 10-ml syringe in a 100-ml beaker) in RPMI1640. Cells recovered from the second collagenase incu bation and from syringing the remaining tissue are pooled, washed, and cleared of coarse debris by rapid passage through a nylon wool column into a 50-ml polystyrene tube (Corning, New York, New York-glass is to be avoided as the mast cells will stick to glass). The resulting cell suspension is centrifuged (200 g, 10 minutes, 15\u00b0C) and resuspended very gently using a siliconized-glass pipet in supplemented RPMI (as above).",

Lymphocytes are the main contaminating population at all stages, representing nearly 30% of the total viable cells in the initial isolated lamina propria population. Mast cell purity rises from 35% in the initial population, to 65% in the Percollenriched population, to >95% in the population purified by sedimentation velocity.

Excessive trauma or chemicals used in the isolation may also impair functions such as NK activity (Chiba et al., 1981; Gibson et al., 1984) . Also, overly aggressive isolation of IEL may result in large numbers of LPL entering the preparation, thereby giving misleading results when one is interested in attributing a particular func tion to one or more compartments. This is illustrated by the disagreement in the literature regarding the number of IEL related to \u0392 cells. In situ staining of human bowel has failed to show up immunoglobulin-positive cells in some reports (Selby et al., 1981) , which is in disagreement with others (Bartnik et al., 1980) . Thus, the description of immunoglobulinpositive isolated IEL is difficult to interpret, since they actually may be a result of contamination by LPL, which are rich in such cells. Descriptions in mouse (Carman et al., 1986; Parrott et al., 1983 ) and rat small intestine (Lyscom and Breuton, 1982) clearly suggest that IEL are free of \u0392 cells and, in the opinion of the authors, this is likely the situation in humans as well.",

This can be tested by putting a positive control cell population through the isolation procedure. This only approximates the situation which occurs with IEL or LPL isolation, since epithelial cell contents, enzymes, and other mediators from the tissues may be responsi ble for negative data. A better experiment entails the mixing of cells expressing the trait (positive control) with gut segments, performing the isolation procedure and comparing the expression of the trait by the mix ture of isolated positive control cells and mucosal leukocytes. Presum ably, the properties of the positive cells will be preserved and express some degree of activity and thereby verify that the isolation procedure is not responsible for negative results. If this type of control (albeit a tedious one) is performed, one would have more confidence when interpreting negative data. An example of this investigation into the effect of the isolation procedure on mast cell secretion is illustrated in Table II . In this example, IMC had little response to the potent PMC secretagogue 48/80. However, to show that the isolation procedure did not effect this re sponse, PMC were isolated in the normal fashion and compared with PMC put through the protocol used for IMC isolation. These data show that the isolation procedure did not markedly interfere with mast cell function. This makes the conclusion that IMC do not react to 48/80 more valid.",

Our understanding of events in this site is relatively great due to the ease with which these cells can be isolated. This is not the case for the diffusely distributed cells in the epithelium or lamina propria. The role of cells in these sites (IEL, LPL) in generating a response is largely unknown, even though antigen can pass through absorptive epithelium and contact IEL and LPL directly. The ability of those compartments to react to antigen may be limited if they lack some of the necessary cells to generate a response. For example, IEL have not yet been shown to possess antigen-presenting cells or some \u03a4 cell regulatory circuits (i.e., antisuppressor pathway); therefore, they may not be capable of generating a response. Despite this absence of cells needed to generate a response, IEL do contain cytotoxic T-lymphocyte precursors.

Until recently, there was little information to clarify whether the intestinal mast cell hyperplasia was a result of local precursors differentiating or an infusion of cells from the blood. With mucosal cells from the mouse intestine, it has been shown that IEL and LPL contain an extraordinarily high number of mast cell precursors. There are approximately 10 times more in gut than bone marrow, 100 times more than spleen, and 100 times more than peripheral lymph nodes (Crapper and Schr\u00e4der, 1983; Guy-Grand et al., 1984) .

Characterization of form and function of a particular mast cell population isolated from a particular site cannot be used to extrapolate directly to form and function of other mast cell populations at the same or at other sites. Heterogeneity is there fore an important consideration when assessing the role mast cells play in disease processes. Moreover, mast cell heterogeneity has added clinical significance as a consideration for relevant therapeutic inter vention.",

Numerous reports in the literature compare and contrast mucosal and systemic responses; however, despite their tissue-specific variations, the different tissues do interact. Compartmentalization of the immune response is substantiated further by the fact that within the GALT, each compartment (Peyer's patch, mesenteric lymph node, lamina propria, and epithelium) possesses its own characteristic and het erogeneous population of cells. This obviously has broad implications regarding the predominant functions or roles of the respective compart ments in the overall immune response.",

This is critical if one is interested in attributing a function to a particular compartment. Sufficient data exist in the literature to allow one to phenotype the cell preparation from each compartment and estimate their purity and allow subsequent comparisons of various subsets. Relating the data from isolated cells to phenotypes of cells described in the literature from in vitro and in situ studies will allow one to estimate the yield of a cell preparation and determine whether it is representative of a particular compartment. Using this approach, one may further define or modify the descriptions of cells in a particular compart ment as well as determine the function of a particular location.",

Negative results must be interpreted with caution, since the isolation procedure may in hibit function or alter the phenotype. Similarly, cells contaminating leuko cyte preparations can affect functional assays. This necessitates that posi tive controls are put through the procedure or even added to intestinal pieces before isolation. If these cells demonstrate a positive response following this handling, then one is more confident of negative results observed in isolated intestinal cells.",
