Here, we show that recombination in betacoronaviruses, including human-infecting viruses like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, frequently encompasses the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the Spike gene. We find that this common process likely led to a recombination event at least 11 years ago in an ancestor of the SARS-CoV-2 involving the RBD. As a result of this recombination event, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share a similar genotype in RBD, including two insertions (positions 432-436 and 460-472), and alleles 427N and 436Y. Both 427N and 436Y belong to a helix that interacts with the human ACE2 receptor. Ancestral state analyses revealed that SARS-CoV-2 differentiated from its most recent common ancestor with RaTG13 by accumulating a significant number of amino acid changes in the RBD. In sum, we propose a two-hit scenario in the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus whereby the SARS-CoV-2 ancestors in bats first acquired genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV by incorporation of a SARS-like RBD through recombination before 2009, and subsequently, the lineage that led to SARS-CoV-2 accumulated further, unique changes specifically in the RBD.",

SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are the only members of Sarbecovirus subgenus of betacoronavirus that are known to infect humans. Other members of this subgenus are frequently found in bats, hypothesized to be the natural reservoir of many zoonotic coronaviruses 4 . In January 2020, a Rhinolophus affinis bat isolate obtained in 2013 from the Yunnan Province in China (named RaTG13) was reported to have 96% similarity to SARS-CoV-2 5 , suggesting that the ancestors of the outbreak virus were recently circulating in bats.

As in the full genome phylogeny, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 were in the same clade, with human SARS-CoV as an outgroup. In light of these results, there two possible scenarios to consider. The first is that SARS-CoV-2 derives from a recombination event between human SARS-CoV and another (unsampled) SARS-like CoV. The second is that there occurred at least two different recombination events, one leading to human SARS-CoV and another one leading to SARS-CoV-2. In either of these two scenarios, the inferred the time to the most recent common ancestor in the recombinant region of the clade leading to RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 is no later than 2009 (2003-2013, 95% HPD limit).",

We suggest a twohit scenario involving both ancestral recombination and recent mutational events in the lineage that led to SARS-CoV-2. It has been hypothesized previously that recombination 8,24 and rapid evolution was observed between bat, civet and human SARS-CoVs 19 . We show that the recombination events preferentially affect the RBD region in the Spike gene, both at the order of genus (betacoronavirus) and In conclusion, our evolutionary analyses have revealed that the evolutionary processes leading to SARS-CoV-2 can be explained by a two-hit scenario of recombination and recent mutational events in the Spike.",

There were too few human-specific recombinations in beta-CoV for in-depth analysis. For beta-CoV analyses, the SARS-CoV genomic coordinates were used as reference (accession NC_004718), whereas for MERS CoVs, we used a MERS-CoV sequence (accession NC_019843) as reference. Windows of 800 nucleotides were selected and binomial tests for the number of breakpoints in each window were performed under the null hypothesis that recombination breakpoints are distributed uniformly along the genome. Given the co-dependence structure of our statistical tests, adjustments were performed using the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure 34 which provides a conservative multiple hypothesis correction that applies in arbitrary dependence conditions.

Full genome phylogenetic tree inference (top) shows SARS-CoV-2 sequence (HUMAN Wuhan-CoV) and its nearest bat-infecting RaTG13 strain clustering in a clade separate from the SARS-CoV isolates from human and bats (BAT and HUMAN SARS lineages) with respect to an outlying and more distant BAT sequence (Hp.betaCoV). Phylogenetic reconstruction (only 3 rd codon positions) in the region of spike containing the RBD, on the other hand (bottom), shows the SARS-CoV-2 lineage clustering together with the HUMAN SARS strain. This change in tree topology gives evidence of a likely recombination in Beta-CoV encompassing the RBD which leads to the appearance of the Wuhan strain. Accession numbers: BAT Hp.betaCoV (KF636752); HUMAN SARS (FJ882963); BAT SARS (DQ071615); BAT SARS seq2 (DQ412043); RaTG13 (MN996532); SARS-CoV-2 (isolate 403962). b.",

Phylogenetic representation summarizing the evolutionary events that likely led to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2: hit 1) Recombination of the RBD of the Spike protein between the lineage ancestral to both SARS-COV-2 and RaTG13 (red star) and the ancestral lineage of the human SARS-CoV (blue star); hit 2) SARS-CoV-2 accumulated five AA mutations in RBD since its divergece from its MRCA. b. Sliding window analysis (length 267 aa) identifies specific regions of SARS-CoV-2 with high divergence from the RaTG13 bat virus in the RBD of Spike (including 427N and 436Y), as well as in the Ubl1, HRV and SUD domains of nsp3 (non-structural protein 3) within the orf1a polyprotein. c.

Substitutions in SARS-CoV-2 at positions 427N and 436Y belong to a helix (blue) situated at the interface of the interaction with ACE2.
