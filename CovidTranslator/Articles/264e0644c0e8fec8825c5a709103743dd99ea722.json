HAdV pneumonia in adults has been most frequently reported in communal living populations, especially among military trainees [3e8] . HAdV type 55 (HAdV-55), an emerging recombinant strain Preliminary results from this study were presented as poster at the joint meeting of ICIC (4th International Interscience Conference on Infection and Chemotherapy) & ISAAR (12th International Symposium on Antimicrobial Agents and Resistance), September 26e28, 2019, Gyeonju, Korea. of types 11 and 14 [9] , has spread rapidly throughout China since the first Chinese outbreak in 2006 [7e10] . HAdV-55 has also been noticed in the Korean military from 2012 and caused a large outbreak beginning in the winter of 2014 [6,11e13] . This nonvaccine-type HAdV outbreak is currently ongoing in the Korean military, with a high burden of morbidity and mortality [13] . In managing severe HAdV pneumonia patients in the Korean military, we tried cidofovir based on previous case reports and in vitro studies [14e16], and we experienced several successes with early administration of cidofovir [17] . Since then, we have routinely administered cidofovir for all patients with potentially severe HAdV pneumonia and risk factors for respiratory failure [18] , but the administration interval from symptom onset varied between patients. To compare outcomes of early and delayed treatment, we conducted a retrospective cohort study in Korean military hospitals for a 7-year period.",

We reviewed electronic medical records of cidofovir-treated HAdV pneumonia patients at 14 military hospitals between January 2012 and December 2018. Among the cidofovir-treated HAdV pneumonia patients, we included patients with potentially severe disease who had any of the following risk factors for respiratory failure at initial presentation [18] : (a) hypoxaemia (PaO 2 <60 mmHg or SpO 2 <90%), (b) monocytopenia (<150/mL), (c) multilobar involvement (three or more lobes on chest computed tomography (CT)), or (d) pleural effusion on chest CT. Included patients were divided into an early treatment group (within 7 days from symptom onset) and a late treatment group (after 7 days from symptom onset), based on the median value of the cohort. The primary outcome was the development of respiratory failure within 21 days after symptom onset. Secondary outcomes included duration of hospital stay, intensive care unit (ICU) care, duration of ICU care, continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support, and death. Secondary outcomes were assessed during the hospital stay of patients. It was generally recommended to administer cidofovir at a dosage of 5 mg/kg weekly in combination with oral probenecid [17] . Since the second dose of cidofovir was selectively administered among patients who progressed to respiratory failure, we evaluated outcomes associated with the first dose. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Armed Forces Medical Command (AFMC-19-IRB-099) and informed consent was waived by the board.",

CURB-65 score was used for the calculation of pneumonia severity [19] , and the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scale for rating dyspnoea [20] . Initial presentation was assessed on the day of the first hospital visit. All included patients first visited the hospital after pneumonia development and were admitted on the same day. HAdV infections were confirmed by multiplex respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests using patients' sputum samples, as previously described [13] . Pneumonia was defined as the presence of parenchymal infiltration on chest x-ray or CT with respiratory symptoms. All included patients underwent chest CT unless whole lung involvement was apparent on chest x-ray. Respiratory failure was defined when mechanical ventilation (MV) support was required with a PaO 2 / FiO 2 ratio 200 mmHg measured after endotracheal intubation. Renal impairment occurring within 2 weeks of cidofovir treatment was assessed according to the RIFLE (risk, injury, failure, loss and end-stage) criteria [21] .",

The KaplaneMeier method was used to calculate the 21day probability of respiratory failure. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate potential risk factors for respiratory failure within 21 days. All factors clinically relevant to the outcome were evaluated by univariate analysis, and statistically significant factors were included in the multivariate analysis to adjust early administration of cidofovir within 7 days after symptom onset. If more than two factors that share parameters or are clinically correlated were statistically significant, only one factor with the strongest HR by univariate analysis was included in the multivariate analysis. A subgroup analysis was conducted among patients who received cidofovir before the development of respiratory failure. Patients who received cidofovir on the same day as or after respiratory failure development were excluded, and the primary outcome was evaluated with the same statistical methods. Missing data are presented in footnotes to the Tables. All p-values were two-tailed, and those <0.05 were considered statistically significant. IBM SPSS Statistics version 20.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for all statistical analyses. Patients who did not have any risk factors for respiratory failure were excluded.

Among patients who progressed to respiratory failure, significantly more patients in the delayed treatment group exhibited late progression to respiratory failure after 7 days from symptom onset compared to those in the early treatment group (16/18, 88.9% versus 3/8, 37.5%; p 0.014). The duration of hospital stay and ICU care were significantly longer in the delayed treatment group than in the early treatment group (both p < 0.05). Significantly more patients in the delayed treatment group received ECMO support than in the early treatment Cidofovir was administered at around the recommended dosage of 5 mg/kg. Under-dosing was observed in 32.6% of patients (29/89) and did not differ between the two groups. Time intervals from admission to treatment and from symptom onset to treatment were significantly shorter in the early treatment group (both p < 0.001). Only 8.1% of the early treatment group (5/62) were treated with a second dose of cidofovir, while 40.7% of the delayed treatment group (11/27) were repeatedly treated (p \u00bc 0.001). Only one patient in the early treatment group experienced acute kidney injury (AKI) within 2 weeks of cidofovir treatment; the patient recovered thereafter. Two patients received CRRT support that was not associated with cidofovir treatment ( Table 2 , footnote).",

            "text": "Fatal HAdV pneumonia in adults has been reported, but an effective treatment modality has not been well evaluated [13, 22] . Among currently available antiviral agents, cidofovirda cytosine nucleotide analogue inhibiting DNA polymerasedis recommended for the treatment of severe HAdV infections based on in vitro and case reports [14, 16, 22, 23] . However, it is not approved for HAdV treatment because of lack of clinical trials. In addition, its high cost and potential adverse effects hinder general use of the drug [22] . Since winter 2014, the Korean military has experienced an explosion of cases of severe HAdV pneumonia due to the ongoing outbreak of HAdV-55 and tried cidofovir for potentially severe HAdV pneumonia patients based on previous experience [6, 13, 17, 18] . Since we treated most potentially severe HAdV cases with cidofovir after the outbreak, a comparison between treated and non-treated patients was not feasible. However, we observed that early administration of cidofovir might prevent progression to respiratory failure and therefore designed the present retrospective cohort study comparing administration time of cidofovir. To our knowledge, the present study is the first comparative study to evaluate the effect of cidofovir for HAdV pneumonia, and could provide supporting data for further clinical studies. Of note, the early treatment group within 7 days from symptom onset was significantly associated with a lower probability of respiratory failure, and late progression to respiratory failure after 10 days from symptom onset was not observed in this group. The treatment interval of 7 days from symptom onset dividing the early and delayed treatment groups was statistically significant in the multivariate analysis. These findings suggest clinical effectiveness of early cidofovir treatment for HAdV pneumonia. The importance of early treatment of respiratory viruses has been emphasized in studies assessing aerosolized ribavirin for respiratory syncytial virus [24] , neuraminidase inhibitors for influenza [25] , and convalescent plasma infusion therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and severe influenza [26] . Likewise, cidofovir would be effective for treating HAdV pneumonia when administered early in the course of the disease, possibly before the progression to respiratory failure. Since cidofovir is expensive and approved only for the treatment of cytomegalovirus infection, it is not readily available in most settings, especially in resource-limited countries. In South Korea, patients need to purchase cidofovir individually through the Korea Orphan and Essential Drug Centre, and the process delays cidofovir administration by at least 1 day. For timely treatment of patients with potentially severe HAdV pneumonia and for further evaluation of clinical efficacy, easy access to cidofovir should be provided.",

Although this was not included in the scope of present study, we tested several statistical analyses among patients progressed to respiratory failure but could not find any meaningful association between the outcome and timing of cidofovir administration. Patients progressing to respiratory failure should be evaluated in another larger cohort containing both cidofovir-treated and non-treated patients. Second, the study population included young military personnel with minimal comorbidities. This cohort may demonstrate better outcomes and fewer complications than the general population. On the other hand, the study cohort was very homogeneous in terms of age and underlying conditions. Third, previously identified risk factors for respiratory failuredincluding hypoxaemia, multilobar involvement and pleural effusiondwere not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis in the present study. This would be because these factors were used as inclusion criteria to select potentially severe patients. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the effect of cidofovir in the population at risk, not among all patients with HAdV pneumonia. Risk factors for respiratory failure were included in the multivariate analysis to adjust the effect of cidofovir treatment, and statistical non-significance does not necessarily mean that these factors were not associated with pneumonia progression. Fourth, as a retrospective study, there were significant differences between the early and delayed treatment group in terms of severity factors including hypoxaemia and whole lung involvement. Although these factors were adjusted in the multivariate analysis, interpretation of the study results should be cautious. Lastly, HAdV typing was not performed in all included patients. Although the major HAdV type during the study period was type 55 [6, 13, 17] , other types of HAdV might have been included in the study cohort. Since in vitro data on cidofovir activity against various HAdV types are limited [14, 27, 28] , careful interpretation of the study result is required, and further studies evaluating the effect of cidofovir on various HAdV types need to be conducted.",
