The proteomic patterns were identified; the tree model of biomarkers was constructed and evaluated using the Biomarker Patterns Software. The model tree was constructed based on the 3 biomarkers (5913 Da, 6181 Da and 13,752 Da), which generated excellent separation between the gallbladder cancer and control groups. The sensitivity was 86.7% and the specificity was 93.3%. The blind test data showed a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%. Taken together, our studies suggested that biomarkers for gallbladder cancer could be discovered in serum by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry combined with the use of magnetic beads. The pattern of combined markers would provide a powerful and reliable diagnostic method for gallbladder cancer with high sensitivity and specificity.",

Genetic abnormality plays critical roles in the development and progression of gallbladder cancer cells. Besides the chemotherapy, currently there lack efficient approaches in clinical practices to prevent gallbladder cancer. This suggests an urgent need in technology to predict and diagnose the patients in early stages of gallbladder cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. The proteomics techniques showed significant contributions to the cancer diagnosis and the finding of new antitumor drugs in recent years. 1 The proteomic patterns in given body fluid sample could be used for the cancer early detection and measuring the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs. 2 For instance, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) offers high-throughput protein profiling. 3, 4 When combined with appropriate bioinformatics tools, 5 the nondisease-related artifacts could be easily removed from the group of potential biomarkers.",

Two microliters of the resulting mixture was aspirated and spotted onto the gold-coated ProteinChip array. After air drying for 5 minutes at room temperature, protein crystals on the chip were scanned with the ProteinChip (Model PBS IIc) reader (Ciphergen) to determine the masses and intensities of all peaks over the range m/z 1000 to 50,000. The reader was set up as follows: mass range (1000 -50,000 Da), optimized mass range (1000 -20,000 Da), laser intensity (200) and sensitivity (9) . Mass calibration was performed using an all-in-one peptide reference standard which contained vasopressin (1084.2 Da), somatostatin (1637.9 Da), bovine insulin \u2424 chain (3495.9 Da), human insulin recombinant (5807.6 Da) and hirudin (7033.6 Da) (Ciphergen Biosystems, Fremont, CA). The default background subtraction was applied, and the peak intensities were normalized using the total ion current from a mass charge of 1000 to 50,000 Da. A biomarker detection software package (Ciphergen Biomarker Wizards, Ciphergen Biosystems) was used to detect protein peaks ( Figure 1 ). Protein peaks were selected based on a first pass of signal-noise ratio of 3 and a minimum peak threshold of 20% of all spectra. This process was completed with a second pass of peak selection at 0.2% of the mass window, and the estimated peaks were added.

At node 2, samples of m/z 6181 with peak intensities lower than or equal to 1.9 went to node 3, which had 3 healthy volunteers and 27 gallbladder cancer samples. The other samples entered terminal node 2, which had 2 gallbladder cancer samples and 2 healthy volunteers. At node 3, samples of m/z 13,752 with peak intensities lower than or equal to 6.7 went to terminal node 3, which had 2 healthy volunteers samples and 26 samples of patients with gallbladder cancer. The other samples went to terminal node 4, which had 1 healthy volunteer sample and 1 gallbladder cancer sample. As presented in Table 3 , the model identified 60 samples of the training set, 30 in gallbladder cancer and 30 in controls, with a sensitivity of 86.7% and specificity of 93.3%. In the blind test set, 18 of 20 true control cases were correctly classified, and 12 of 15 gallbladder cancer samples were correctly classified as malignant, yielding a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 90%.",

It is also a positive marker in severe acute respiratory syndrome 18 and indicates relapse in gastric cancer. 19 The mass of our marker 3 (13,752 Da) is very similar to that of serum amyloid A as reported by Liu et al. 4 The other biomarker (6181 Da) still needs to be resolved in future studies.

The possibility is yet to be verified with high-performance liquid chromatography isolation of components of the single spots.",

With the panel of 3 selected biomarkers, we could achieve high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of gallbladder cancer. We expect to explore the structure and function of these protein biomarkers for gallbladder cancer development/progression in future studies. . The decision trees of diagnostic model for gallbladder cancer (GC) and non-GC (control). Each node was represented with different m/z value, and the diagnosis result went left or right depending on the detected peaks in the training test set. The root node (top) and descendant nodes were shown as ellipses, and the terminal nodes (nodes 1-4) were shown as rectangles. The mass value in the nodes was followed by lower or equal to intensity value. If the answer to the question in a node of the tree is yes, you proceed down to the left node, otherwise (ie, no), you proceed down to the right node. When proceeding to the terminal nodes, the decision tree assigned samples to 2 groups. Samples in terminal nodes 1, 2 and 4 were assigned to control and terminal node 3 was to gallbladder cancer. The numbers in rectangles represent the actual clinical diagnosis of samples assigned to this terminal node by decision tree (ie, in terminal node 1, decision tree assigned 21 samples to control but actually 20 of them were control according to the clinical diagnosis).

The root node (top) and descendant nodes were shown as ellipses, and the terminal nodes (nodes 1-4) were shown as rectangles. The mass value in the nodes was followed by lower or equal to intensity value. If the answer to the question in a node of the tree is yes, you proceed down to the left node, otherwise (ie, no), you proceed down to the right node. When proceeding to the terminal nodes, the decision tree assigned samples to 2 groups. Samples in terminal nodes 1, 2 and 4 were assigned to control and terminal node 3 was to gallbladder cancer. The numbers in rectangles represent the actual clinical diagnosis of samples assigned to this terminal node by decision tree (ie, in terminal node 1, decision tree assigned 21 samples to control but actually 20 of them were control according to the clinical diagnosis).",
