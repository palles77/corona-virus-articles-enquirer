Many conventional methods, such as viral culture and immunofluorescence (IF) detection, are time consuming and have low sensitivity. Viral culture is recognised as the 'gold standard' for the identification of viral pathogens. However, cytopathic effects in cell cultures may not be observed for up to 10 days in diagnostic laboratories. Although a combination of viral culture and IF staining is sufficient to obtain a positive result, these methods are associated with a large number of false negative results (12) (13) (14) .",

A total of 46 specimens (23.1%) were positive by direct IF (Table 1) ; the viruses detected included RSV, AdV, influenza A H3 subtype, PIV-1 and PIV-3. The majority of the respiratory specimens (78.4%, 156/199) were positive according to the xTAG RVP FAST v2 assay ( Table 1 ). The assay identified RSV, HRV/ HEV, AdV, influenza A H3 subtype, influenza A H1N1 subtype, influenza B, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, PIV-4, HBoV, HCoV, NL63 subtype and HMPV. None of the specimens were positive for influenza A H1 subtype or HCoV NL63, HKU1 and 229E subtypes. According to all three methods, eight specimens were positive (AdV [n = 1], influenza A [n = 1] and RSV [n = 6]), and 43 specimens were negative ( Table 2 ). The results of viral isolation and direct IF revealed discrepancies in findings for 44 specimens, with RSV (n = 29), PIV-3 (n =2), HMBV (n = 5) and influenza A (n = 1) detected by direct IF but not isolated by the culture method. Conversely, RSV (n = 1), AdV (n = 2), influenza A (n = 1), influenza B (n = 2) and PIV-2 (n = 1) were isolated by the culture method but not by direct IF.",

However, in the present study, influenza viruses occurred mainly as single infectious agents of ARTIs. In contrast, HEV/HRV most commonly occurred in conjunction with HBoV in children. The clinical significance of viral co-infections remains uncertain. Noh et al. (41) showed that the severity of clinical illness in patients with multiple viral agents was not markedly different from that of patients with a single viral agent. However, in some cases, respiratory viruses in co-infections have been reported to cause more severe illness than the viral pathogens responsible for the primary infection. In the present study, it was not possible to differentiate between the primary infectious virus and the coinfecting virus. A further study to correlate the clinical significance of the presence of multiple viral pathogens could be performed in the future.",

In comparison to conventional viral isolation and direct IF methods, this assay is rapid and highly sensitive and can be used in routine respiratory disease diagnostic services. The clinical use of the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay will aid the diagnosis of infection, thereby improving clinical management via earlier treatment. However, prior to the routine application of the xTAG RVP Fast v2 assay in diagnostic virology laboratories, the analytical sensitivity of the assay must be considered in relation to hands-on-time, time-to-results and clinical relevance of the detected respiratory viruses.",

The amplification conditions were as follows: 50 \u00b0C for 20 min, initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, followed by 36 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing at 59 \u00b0C for 30 sec and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 30 sec. Finally, the PCR process was ended by a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 2 min. Hybridisation was performed by mixing 2 \u00b5L of amplicons with 20 \u00b5L of xTAG RVP FAST v2 Bead Mix and 75 \u00b5L of reporter solution.
