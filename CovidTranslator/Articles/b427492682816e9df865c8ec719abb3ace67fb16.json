The limited recovery may be due to viruses losing infectivity as they are detached from the soil surface, as reported elsewhere. 1 MS2 recoveries were ~2% for all of the tested extraction solutions; this was not surprising based on the low percentage (6%) of MS2 associated with the wastewater solids at equilibrium.
