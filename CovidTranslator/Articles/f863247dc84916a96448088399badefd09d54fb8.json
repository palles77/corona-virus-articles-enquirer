Our previous work with SARS-like viruses argued that bats already 3 harbor CoVs with the ability to infect humans without adaptation. These results suggested that 4 additional barriers limit the emergence of zoonotic CoV. In this work, we describe overcoming 5 host restriction of two MERS-like bat CoVs using exogenous protease treatment. We found that 6 the spike protein of PDF2180-CoV, a MERS-like virus found in a Ugandan bat, could mediate 7 infection of Vero and human cells in the presence of exogenous trypsin. We subsequently show 8 that the bat virus spike can mediate infection of human gut cells, but is unable to infect human 9 lung cells. Using receptor-blocking antibodies, we show that infection with the PDF2180 spike 10 does not require MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 and antibodies developed against the MERS spike 11 receptor-binding domain and S2 portion are ineffective in neutralizing the PDF2180 chimera.",

Similarly, reverse genetics systems permitted the exploration of 42 zoonotic coronaviruses (8); using the known SARS spike/ACE2 receptor interaction, chimeric 43 viruses containing the backbones of bat CoVs were generated to evaluate the efficacy of both 44 vaccines and therapeutics (9-12).

The 191 chimeric virus containing the spike protein from PDF-2180 was capable of replication in Vero 192 cells and human cells (Huh7, Caco-2) if treated with exogenous trypsin. However, neither 193 continuous nor primary human airway cultures were susceptible to infection, contrasting wild-194 type MERS-CoV. The MERS-Uganda chimera also maintained replication despite treatment 195 with antibodies blocking human DPP4, suggesting use of either an alternative receptor or a 196 different entry mechanism for infection. Importantly, current therapeutics targeting the MERS 197 spike protein showed no efficacy against the MERS-Uganda chimera, highlighting a potential 198 public health vulnerability to this and related group 2C CoVs. Finally, the trypsin-mediated 199 rescue of a second zoonotic group 2C CoV, HKU5-CoV, validates findings that suggested that 200 protease cleavage may represent a critical barrier to zoonotic CoV infection in new hosts (25, 201 26). Together, the results highlight the importance of spike processing in CoV infection, expand 202 the correlates associated with emergence beyond receptor binding alone, and provide a 203 platform strategy to recover previously non-cultivatable zoonotic CoVs. 204 With the ongoing threat posed by circulating zoonotic viruses, understanding the barriers 205 for viral emergence represents a critical area of research. For CoVs, receptor binding has been 206 believed to be the primary constraint to infection in new host populations. Following the SARS-207 CoV outbreak, emergence in humans was attributed to mutations within the receptor-binding 208 domain that distinguished the epidemic strain from progenitor viruses harbored in bats and 209 civets (27). Yet, work by our group and others has indicated that zoonotic SARS-like viruses 210 circulating in Southeast Asian bats are capable of infecting human cells by binding to the known 211 human ACE2 receptor without adaptation (13, 14, 28). Similarly, pseudotyped virus studies 212 have identified zoonotic strains HKU4-CoV and NL140422-CoV as capable of binding to human 213 DPP4 without mutations to the spike(26, 29).

Overall, the new paradigm argues that both receptor binding and 231 protease activation barriers must be overcome for successful zoonotic CoV infection of a new 232 host. 233 The requirement for exogenous trypsin treatment is not unique to MERS-Uganda or 234 HKU5-CoV. Influenza strains are well known to require trypsin treatment to facilitate their 235 release in cell culture (30). In addition, highly pathogenic avian influenza strains have been 236 linked to mutations that improve cleavage by ubiquitous host protese, augmenting their tissue 237 tropism and virulence (31). Similarly, a wealth of enteric viruses, including polio, cowpox, and 238 rotaviruses, depend on trypsin to prime, modulate, and/or expand infection (32, 33). Even within 239 the CoV family, enteric viruses, including PEDV, porcine delta CoV, and swine acute diarrhea SADS) CoV require trypsin for replication in vitro (34-36). Together, these prior 241 studies illustrate the importance of protease activation in virus infections. However, the protease 242 barrier to PDF-2180 and HKU5-CoV spike-mediated infection may also reflect on the 243 emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. While initial studies argued that receptor binding 244 was the primary barrier, the existence of zoonotic strains capable of efficiently using the same 245 human entry receptors contradicts that suggestion (13, 14).
