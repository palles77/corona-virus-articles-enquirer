A few strains of IBV grow in VEI~O cells (4, 5) , BHK-21 cells (10) and chick embryo fibroblast (CE) cells (9, 10) . CE cells are easier to prepare than CK cells and it would be advantageous if, by incorporating some agent into the medium, plaque formation could be made to occur. Trypsin markedly enhances the in vitro infectivity of various viruses, i.e. rotavirus (11, 12) , influenza viruses (1, 2, 8, 15) , Sendal virus (7) , reovirus (13) and vaeeinia virus (6) . Quite recently, S:ro~z et al. (14) reported that trypsin enhanced plaque formation of an enteropathogenic bovine coronavirus in bovine fetal thyroid and bovine fetal brain cells. In the present report, we describe plaque formation by IBV in CE cells when trypsin is incorporated into the overlay medium.",

(14) reported that eoronaviral particles produced in trypsin-treated bovine cells had uniformly shorter surface projection than did the viral forms generated by trypsinfree cell cultures. The results reported here show that trypsin was required during the whole period of plaque development and we therefore assume that it acts on successive cycles of virus replication. CA~]~ et al. (2) suggested that pancreatin produced its effect by an action on the host cells. In the present investigation, however, IBV A-5968 strain did not form plaques in CE cells which had been pre-incubated with trypsin. Possibly trypsin facilitates the development of IBV plaques by acting on the released virus particles, as has been described for reovirus (13), influenza virus (8) and rotavirus (12) . Further studies are necessary to establish the mechanism(s) by which trypsin enhances plaque formation of IBV.",
