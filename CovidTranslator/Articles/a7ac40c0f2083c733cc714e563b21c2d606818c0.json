The characteristics of these trials were summarized in Table 1 More trials on TCM treatment use 2 or more primary endpoints (PEs) than those on CDs or BTs (57.6%, 39.4% and 40.5%, respectively). Some trials even have 6 or more PEs. The most 3 common used PEs are associated with clinical symptoms(73.1%), pathogen(29.2%) and lung function(27.5%).
