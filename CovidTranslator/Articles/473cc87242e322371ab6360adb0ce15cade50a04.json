E-mail: yjsu.5885@mmh.org., China. A novel beta-coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention from the throat swab sample of a patient, that was subsequently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11 February 2020 [1]. Prior to this only two mutant strains of coronaviruses have caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory disease worldwide; one is severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), in 2003, while the other is the middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), in 2012.",
