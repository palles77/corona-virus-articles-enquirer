Optimal control strategies are proposed to minimize both the disease burden and the intervention cost. We prove the existence and uniqueness of optimal control paths and obtain these optimal paths analytically using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We analyse our results numerically to compare various strategies of proposed controls. It is observed that implementation of three controls is most effective and less expensive among all the strategies. Thus, we conclude that in order to reduce tuberculosis threat all the three controls must be taken into consideration concurrently.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a major global health threat caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) that most often affects the lungs (pulmonary TB) but can affect other sites as well (extrapulmonary TB). Fortunately, TB is a preventable and curable disease. Following the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 51 million patients have been successfully treated in countries that adopted the WHO strategy since 1995 [1] . However, the global burden of TB remains enormous. In 2011, there were an estimated 8.7 million new cases of TB (13% co-infected with HIV) and 1.4 million people died from TB [1] . In 2013, there were 9 million new TB cases and 1.5 million TB deaths (in which 0.4 million are HIV-positive patients) [2] . The increase of new cases lies in multiple factors such as the spread of HIV, the collapse of public health programs, the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mtb [3] [4] [5] and exogenous re-infections, where a latently-infected individual acquires a new infection from another infectious individual (see, for example, [6, 7] and references therein). The TB control approach is the chemoprophylaxis treatment in the absence of an effective vaccine. Neglecting the compliance with drug treatments might result in a relapse and antibiotic resistant TB, i.e. multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) [8] . MDR-TB is one of the most serious health problems and the progress in curing that is slow. Critical funding gaps for TB care and control make it difficult to sustain recent gains, promote further research and develop new drugs and vaccines [1] .",

            "text": "It is well known that the mathematical models play vital roles in the dynamics and control of many epidemics including malaria, severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and TB (see, for example, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and references therein). Many mathematical dynamic models for TB have been studied extensively in the literature; for instance we refer the reader to [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . \"Fast progressors\" and \"slow progressors\" are two different ways considered by most models to progress to active disease after infection. The probability of latent and treated individuals who might be reinfected [24] is also taken into account by some latest models as the infection and/or disease do not confer full protection which is already well recognized [25] . Some previous models of TB, especially the predictive models endeavor to calculate a threshold called basic reproductive number. The dynamics of transmission of the disease has been analyzed in terms of the reduction of the basic reproductive number. Since the first paper published by Jung et al. [8] in 2002, the time dependent optimal control strategies have been employed in the study of dynamics of TB mathematical models by many authors (see, for example, [8, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] ). Valuable theoretical results generated by both approaches of studying control strategies can be used to guide epidemic control programs. Various objective criteria may be adopted, according to a chosen goal (or goals).",

The parameter represents the constant recruitment rate of susceptible individuals. Parameter p is the rate at which susceptible individuals are moved into the vaccination process. The natural death rate is \u03bc. The disease-induced death rate coefficient for individuals in compartment I is \u03b1. Parameter \u03c1 represents the rate that individuals successfully treated of TB return to the latent TB stage and parameter \u03b3 is the treatment rate in the infective class. It is assumed that the time before latent individuals become infectious obeys an exponential distribution, with mean waiting time 1 \u03b4 . Thus, \u03b4 is the rate at which an individual leaves the latent compartment to become infectious. Susceptible individuals acquire TB infection from individuals with active TB at rate \u03b2S(I + \u03c1 1 T ) , where \u03b2 is the disease transmission coefficient, and the parameter \u03c1 1 < 1 accounts for the reduction in infectiousness among individuals with active TB who are treated (in comparison to those who are not treated). Fraction l of susceptible individuals who acquire TB infection is assumed to enter the latent TB class ( L ), at the rate \u03b2S(I + \u03c1 1 T ) , while the remainder moves to the active TB class ( I ). It is assumed that individuals in the latent class do not transmit infection. The vaccinated individuals are infected at rate \u03c1 2 \u03b2V (I + \u03c1 1 T ) , where \u03c1 2 < 1 represents the reduction in risk of infection owing to vaccination (for a vaccine that offers 100% protection, \u03c1 2 = 0 ; thus in reality 0 < \u03c1 2 < 1).

This indicates that the basic reproduction number, R 0 , plays a crucial role in characterizing dynamics of the disease and could be used to suggest or design TB control strategies. However, they did not further investigate time dependent control strategies since their discussions had been concentrated on prevalence of TB at equilibria. Note that, \u2202 p | (1 . 1) < 0 , also due to Liu and Zhang [24] , which implies that increasing the vaccination rate of susceptible individuals against infection of TB is conducive to disease control. In order to understand the dynamics under what circumstances TB can be controlled or curtailed, we implement the theory of optimal control. Three intervention strategies, called controls, are included in model system (1.1) . We write controls as functions of time and assign reasonable upper and lower bounds to them. First, a \"case finding\" (identification of latently infected individuals) control mechanism is incorporated in model (1.1) by replacing constant vaccination rate with u 1 ( t ). Second, a \"case holding\" (treatment of individuals with active TB) control mechanism is incorporated in model (1.1) by replacing constant successfully treatment rate with u 2 ( t ). Finally, another \"case holding\" is instituted in model (1.1) by replacing constant treatment rate with u 3 ( t ). It is required that u 1 ( t ), u 2 ( t ) and u 3 ( t ) are bounded Lebesgues integrable functions. We intend to determine optimal control strategies that minimize not only the infected individuals but also the cost of these three controls. As mentioned by Kumar and Srivastava [14] , the larger proportion of population is covered, the higher efforts and expenditure is required to provide vaccination. Hence, it is suitable to use the nonlinearity of order four to describe the high expensiveness concerned with the vaccination process. Following the idea of Kumar and Srivastava [14] , in this paper, the cost constructions that account for high nonlinear relationship (nonlinearity of order four i.e. u 4 1 (t) ) between cost and effort s during vaccination process has been employed in the application of optimal control to TB mathematical models.",

Therefore, the cost for covering larger proportion of population involved in vaccination process will be not only increasing but also growth of cost will be faster and steeper.

We observe from Fig. 1 that the susceptible population is higher under control compared to the case without control. The results in Fig. 2 predict a higher level of vaccinated population for the aforementioned tuberculosis intervention strategies under control compared to the case without control. The results depicted in Figs. 3 and 4 clearly suggest that the optimal control results are very effective in control of individuals infected with TB in latent stage and in the active stage, as expected. In Fig. 5 , the population of treated humans declines sharply in the first 18 years and after that decrease further, while Fig. 4 shows slight increase in the last two years of the intervention strategy. This is due to the fact that the treatment control u 3 becomes zero after 18 years. The simulation results in Fig. 6 suggest that this strategy would require that the vaccination control u 1 should be at maximum for almost the entire period of intervention, while treatment controls u 2 and u 3 should maintain maximum effort s f or 13 years and 18 years respectively before decreasing to zero.",

In Fig. 9 we present the effect of varying the disease transmission coefficient \u03b2 on the number of individuals infected with TB in the active stage ( I ( t )).

By aid of 3 An easy induction gives thatwhere K \u2265 1 + 2 d . In order to simplify the right-hand of (4.2) , another common expression can be used repeatedly,where C depends on bounds for x and y . Based on the above arguments, we findwhere M 1 , N 1 are appropriate upper-bounds. Similarly, we can obtain the following inequalities for (x i (t f ) , x i (t f )) and (y j (0) , y j (0)) with i = 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and j = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 :Now it follows from (4.5), (4.6), (4.7), (4.8), (4.9), (4.10), (4.11), (4.12), (4.13), (4.14) that 0 (x 1 \u2212 x 1 ) 2 dt will be nonnegative. Similar arguments apply to remaining integral terms, we can obtain all of the other \u03bb s and t f s . Take the maximum of all of the \u03bb s used as \u03bb and the minimum of the t f s used as t f , then the coefficient of each integral term in (4.15) is nonnegative. This implies that Hence the solution of (3.7) is unique for small time. This ends the proof. Remark 4.1. We note that Theorem 4.1 shows that the solution of (3.7) is unique when t f is small. As pointed out by Lenhart and Workman [36] , we can usually obtain uniqueness of the solutions for (3.7) , but only for small time t f . This small time condition is due to reverse time orientations of the state equation and adjoint equation.",
