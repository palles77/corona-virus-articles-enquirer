The recombinant NPs (rNPs) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by nickel-affinity column and size exclusion chromatography. Sequencing data indicated that the N genes of CCoV-BJ70 and CRCoV-BJ202 belonging to two distinctly different groups were relatively conserved within each subgroup. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results showed that rNPs of CCoV and CRCoV were expressed efficiently and isolated with a final purity of over 95%. Western blot analysis revealed the rNP from CRCoV could cross-react with mice antisera against human coronavirus (HCoV-229E, NL63, OC43, HKU1), while rNP of CCoV had cross-reactivity with only anti-sera against viruses belonging to the same group (HCoV-229E and NL63). In summary, CCoV and CRCoV rNPs were successfully expressed in E. coli and showed antigenic cross-reactivity with antisera raised against human coronaviruses. These findings indicate that further serologic studies on coronavirus infections at the animal-human interface are needed. canine coronavirus, canine respiratory coronavirus, nucleocapsid protein, expression, cross-reactivity Citation:",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that are highly prevalent in animal and human populations (Woo et al., 2009) . To our knowledge, six types of coronaviruses have been recognized to be pathogenic to humans: HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1 and MERS-CoV. Because of the high mutation frequency and broad host ranges of this virus, novel coronaviruses have emerged and evolved to cross species during the past decade, generating novel strains, serotypes and genotypes. Canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) are common viral pathogens responsible for mild to severe enteritis or respiratory symptoms in dog populations (Nicola and Canio, 2008) . CCoV infection was first reported in a German military dog with diarrhea in 1971 (Binn et al., 1974) . Since then, CCoV has been determined to be epidemic globally, and dogs of all breeds and ages appear to be susceptible to infection (Costa et al., 2014; Erles and Brownlie, 2009; Lorusso et al., 2009; Naylor et al., 2002; Yachi and Mochizuki, 2006) . In China, CCoV was isolated from the heart and gastrointestinal contents of a sick dog for the first time in 1995 (Kong, 2007) , and identified in deceased giant pandas in 2009 (Gao et al., 2009) . In 2003, a novel respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) distinct from CCoV was detected from the respiratory tracts of diseased dogs in the UK (Erles et al., 2003) . Currently, CRCoV is found in dogs in Europe as well as Asia (Lorusso et al., 2009; Yachi and Mochizuki, 2006) .",

Four human coronaviruses HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, HCoV-HKU1, MERS-CoV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV), as well as CRCoV, are Betacoronaviruses, but belong to different subgroups. Phylogenetically, CCoV is closely related to HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, while CRCoV is close to BCoV and HCoV-OC43. It has been suggested that CRCoV might share the same ancestor in this clade, or originated from a host transfer from bovine to canine (Erles et al., 2003) .",

As reported, the glycosylated S protein mediates attachment of the coronavirus to cellular receptors and fusion with the cell membrane (Belouzard et al., 2012) . The N protein is a phosphorylated protein, and is the most abundant. It interacts with viral RNA and makes up the core structure of viral particles (Li et al., 2005) . It has been revealed that a high level of IgG antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV can persist for a long time after the onset of symptoms, and thus may be a marker for highly sensitive serological diagnosis (Tan et al., 2004) . As the N protein is an unglycosylated protein, it can be easily expressed in bacteria and isolated with high purity. Therefore, antibodies against N protein appear to be ideal candidates as diagnostic markers.",

Amino acid sequence alignment revealed the N gene of CCoV-BJ70 had a relatively high identity of 98.2% compared to CCoV-NTU336. In addition, the N gene of CCoV-BJ70 was also 91.4% to 97.7% identical to other strains of canine coronaviruses, including CCoV-TN449, CCoV-1-71, CCoV-fc00-089, CCoV-GPV, CCoV-A76, CCoV-K378, CCoV-BGF10, and CCoV-INSAVC. Compared with the closely related coronavirus strains from pig (TGEV-Purdue) and cat (FCoV-Black), the identity of amino acid sequence was 93.5% and 78.6% respectively (data not shown), showing the higher genetic relatedness between CCoV and TGEV.

The highly conserved sequence is indicated by a red frame. and respiratory infections, and signs of infections vary from mild to moderate, but are severe in puppies or in combination with other pathogens (Kong, 2007) . N protein is an abundant and crucial structural protein in coronavirus particles, and has an important role in the viral immune response (Li et al., 2005) . Antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) using monoclonal antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV have been validated as useful for early diagnosis of SARS (Che et al., 2004) . Thus, serological assays targeting the NP of coronaviruses are considered important to for diagnosis of viral infection. Characterization of the antigenicity of nucleocapsid proteins derived from individual coronaviruses is essential for the development of serological assays for coronaviruses. It is notable that CoVs are characterized as having high rates of mutation and recombination, which is important to the transfer of hosts and alterations of virulence. We cloned the NP coding genes of CCoV (CCoV-BJ70) and CRCoV (CRCoV-BJ202) from diseased pet dogs in Beijing and followed with sequence analysis. Our data identified that CCoV-BJ70 and CRCoV-BJ202 belong to two distinctly different subgroups with close relationships with strains isolated from relatively near regions, based on the N gene phylogenetic tree. The CCoV-BJ70 clustered with other CCoVs in the Alphacoronavirus genus, including a Chinese strain isolated from deceased giant pandas, but was distinct from heterologous coronaviruses HCoV-229E and NL63. CRCoV-BJ202 was closely related to a Korean strain: CRCoV-K37, as well as HCoV-OC43. Furthermore, N protein identity between CCoVs and HCoVs also confirmed the phylogeny. Notably, the N protein identity observed between CCoV-BJ70 and HCoVs was only 25.5% to 39.9%, but was highly similar with other CCoV strains. However, CRCoV-BJ202 has a high identity of 96.7% to HCoV-OC43, suggesting that CRCoV might share the same origin with HCoV-OC43 or recombination has occurred between them. Although the phylogenic relationship and amino acid sequence similarity was observed, the potential of crossreactivity between these coronaviruses is still unclear.",

Furthermore, we analyzed the antigenic relationship among CCoV, CRCoV and HCoVs. As shown in Figure 5 , CCoV NP reacted with antisera from HCoV-229E and NL63 belonging to Alphacoronavirus, but showed weaker antigenicity, which may be due to the limited number of conserved antigenic sites among the subgroup. No significant cross-reactivity was observed to polyclonal antisera from three other HCoVs in the Betacoronavirus genus, indicating an extremely low avidity of the respective antibody, or a distinctly far antigenic relationship between these different clades. In contrast, CRCoV NP showed cross-reactive binding to antisera from mice immunized with the N proteins of HCoV-HKU1 and OC43, respectively, to a nearly same degree, and they all resolved into several fuzzy bands, except to the anti-MERS-CoV. Interestingly, CRCoV seems to be phylogenetically distant with HCoV-229E and NL63, but showed weaker reactivity than that of HCoV-HKU1 and OC43. This might be explained by conserved NP immune epitopes shared between both alpha and beta viruses, such as the highly conserved motif FYYLGTGP. In addition, CRCoV NP reacted strongly with anti-OC43 as did anti-HKU1, which may be attributed to the high identity of the NP amino acid sequence of CRCoV to HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 respectively. However, CRCoV NP showed weaker reactivity with anti-MERS-CoV than antisera derived from four other HCoVs. This may be due to the variations in their primary sequence, which can influence the antigenic sites and lead to a variety of cross-reactivity. Furthermore, the crossreactivity generated between the two rNPs and anti-HCoVs was inconsistent with the identity of the NP sequences. This difference is possibly due to insufficient recognition by HCoVs antibodies, or different antigenic sites within the N proteins were exposed to an immune response, also indicating the potential complexity in serological diagnosis.",
