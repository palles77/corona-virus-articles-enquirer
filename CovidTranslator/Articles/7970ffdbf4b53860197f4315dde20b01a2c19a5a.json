            "text": "Engagement of the programmed death (PD)-1 receptor on activated cells by its ligand (PD-L1) is a mechanism for suppression of activated T-lymphocytes. Microglia, the resident inflammatory cells of the brain, are important for pathogen detection and initiation of innate immunity, however, a novel role for these cells as immune regulators has also emerged. PD-L1 on microglia has been shown to negatively regulate T-cell activation in models of multiple sclerosis and acute viral encephalitis. In this study, we investigated the role of glial cell PD-L1 in controlling encephalitogenic CD8 + T-lymphocytes, which infiltrate the brain to manage viral infection, but remain to produce chronic neuroinflammation. Using a model of chronic neuroinflammation following murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV)-induced encephalitis, we found that CD8 + T-cells persisting within the brain expressed PD-1. Conversely, activated microglia expressed PD-L1. In vitro, primary murine microglia, which express low basal levels of PD-L1, upregulated the coinhibitory ligand upon IFN-\u03b3-treatment. Blockade of the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway in microglial: CD8 + T-cell co-cultures increased T-cell IFN-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-2 production. We observed a similar phenomenon following blockade of this co-inhibitory pathway in astrocyte: CD8 + T-cell co-cultures. Using ex vivo cultures of brain leukocytes, including microglia and CD8 + T-cells, obtained from mice with MCMV-induced chronic neuroinflammation, we found that neutralization of either PD-1 or PD-L1 increased IFN-\u03b3 production from virus-specific CD8 + Tcells stimulated with MCMV IE1 168-176 peptide. These data demonstrate that microglia and astrocytes control antiviral T-cell responses and suggest a therapeutic potential of PD1: PD-L1 modulation to manage the deleterious consequences of uncontrolled neuroinflammation.",

It is becoming evident that following CNS insult and acute inflammation, the brain does not return to its pre-infection state; animal models of neurodegenerative disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and brain infection each show prolonged activation of resident microglia and sustained presence of memory T-cells. Overactive and persistent immune activation within the brain can be detrimental to sensitive neuronal cells resulting in focal neuropathology and, correspondingly, memory deficits (Armien et al. 2010) . Thus, suppression of persistent brain inflammation is critical to limiting bystander tissue damage and preserving neurological function.",

            "text": "Microglia are the resident immune cells of the brain and have been traditionally thought to be proinflammatory. Recent studies, however, suggest they play additional roles as immune regulators. Microglia limit CNS pathology by suppressing proinflammatory cytokine production from brain-infiltrating T-cells through activation of the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1): programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) pathway. PD-L1 (CD274, B7-H1), a co-inhibitory molecule expressed on antigen presenting cells, which plays a crucial role in the functional suppression of T-cell responses (Latchman et al. 2004 ). Engagement of PD-1 on activated CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells by PD-L1 has been shown as a mechanism for suppression of T-cell function, commonly referred to as T-cell exhaustion. In the absence of PD-L1 (PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice), coronavirus infection of the brain resulted in a heightened inflammatory response, ultimately leading to the more rapid clearance of virus from the CNS (Phares et al. 2013) . This comes at a cost however, PD-L1 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited quicker onset of clinical symptoms and a higher rate of mortality, demonstrating the importance of this pathway in negatively regulating neuroinflammation in the brain. PD-L1 expression on microglia, as well as on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, has been shown to decrease T-cell activation in models of multiple sclerosis, as well as during acute viral encephalitis (Duncan and Miller 2011; Magnus et al. 2005; Phares et al. 2009 ). However, little is known about the immunoregulatory role of microglia during chronic, persistent neuroinflammation in animals that recover from viral brain infection.",

            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) brain infection is the most significant cause of neurological disorders related to intrauterine infection in humans and is also a major cause of encephalitis during acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (Cheeran et al. 2009a) . Using a mouse model of murine (M)CMV infection, we have previously shown that, in the aftermath of a non-lethal acute viral infection, the CNS is maintained in a state of chronic neuroinflammation. Sustained immune activation within the brain is a key feature of herpesvirus pathogenicity (Armien et al. 2010) , along with the establishment of latency after clearance of acute infection and the potential for virus reactivation (Fields 2007) . Prolonged immune responses within the brain following MCMV infection are characterized by persistence of antibody-producing B-cells, chronic microglial cell activation, and retention of MCMV-specific effector-memory CD8 + T-cells (Mutnal et al. 2011b; Mutnal et al. 2012) . Although CD8 + T-cells play an important role in controlling acute brain infection (Reddehase et al. 1987; Reddehase et al. 1985) , the chronic presence of these IFN-\u03b3-producing T-cells may be damaging to the brain. While retention of antigen-specific CD8 + T-cells following MCMV infection helps to protect against virus reactivation, they are also responsible for long-term activation of microglia throughout the brain (Mutnal et al. 2011b) . Cytotoxic CD8 T-lymphocytes have been shown responsible for the destruction of healthy bystander neurons in the retina (McPherson et al. 2006) . Thus, maintaining CD8 + T-cells in a functionally suppressed state in the brain may enable both adequate neuroprotection from subsequent infection or reactivation, while also limiting unnecessary bystander neurotoxicity.",

This infection is rapidly cleared through the action of microglia, the resident CNS immune sentinels, and the recruitment of innate and adaptive immune cells from the periphery. We have previously shown that this acute and controlled viral brain infection results in chronic neuroinflammation that can persist for at least 30 d following viral clearance (Mutnal et al. 2011b) . Isolation and flow cytometry of brain mononuclear cells (BMNCs), including microglia and CNS-infiltrating leukocytes, from MCMV-infected mice showed that microglia upregulate the surrogate activation marker, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, during the acute phase of infection and continue to chronically express this protein on their surface (Mutnal et al. 2011b) . MHC class II expression on microglia is notably absent in sham-, mock-and un-infected mice. In the present study, we first confirmed this widespread and prolonged expression of MHC class II on microglia using immunohistochemistry. At 30 days post-infection (dpi) in the post-encephalitic brains of MCMV-infected mice, ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) was found to colocalize with MHC class II on activated microglia ( Figure 1A ).",

Microglial suppression of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells has been shown during the active phase of viral infection in murine models of multiple sclerosis (Carter et al. 2007; Magnus et al. 2005; Phares et al. 2013 ). It is not known whether similar mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of T-cells persisting within the CNS during chronic neuroinflammation in the absence of active viral replication. Using our MCMV brain infection model, we first examined the kinetics of PD-L1 expression on microglia from the acute, productive phase of infection (7 dpi) into the chronic neuroinflammatory, post-viral clearance phase (30 dpi). Resting microglia, which are identified by flow cytometry as the CD45 int CD11b + population, in uninfected mice expressed low levels of PD-L1. In contrast, during the acute phase of viral infection PD-L1 surface expression on microglia increased dramatically (control = 19.7% vs. MCMVinfected = 90.6%) and remained elevated during persistent neuroinflammation (29.4%) ( Figure 1B) .",

To investigate the interaction of microglia and CD8 + T-cells during chronic neuroinflammation we examined CD8 + T-cell PD-1 expression kinetics following MCMV brain infection. To this end, BMNCs were isolated from MCMV-infected mice at 7 and 30 dpi. The CD45 + CD11b low -identified T-cell population was further gated on for analysis of the CD8 + subpopulation. During the acute phase of infection (7 dpi) PD-1 surface expression on CD8 + T-cells within the brain was elevated (40.7%). PD-1 expression remained elevated on CD8 + T-cells during CNS persistence (14 dpi = 14.7%; 30 dpi = 8.3 %), however the percentage of PD-1 + CD8 cells decreased compared to levels observed during the acute infection ( Figure 2C ).

First, we confirmed the activation and upregulation of PD-L1 on cultured microglial in response to IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and IL-1\u03b2, proinflammatory cytokines found during acute and chronic infection (Armien et al. 2010; Marques et al. 2008; Mutnal et al. 2011b ). IFN-\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, or IL-1\u03b2 stimulation for 24 h resulted in a 4-fold increase in PD-L1 mRNA expression in microglia, compared to unstimulated controls ( Figure 3A) . Similarly, 24 h incubation with IFN-\u03b3, a potent T-cellsecreted cytokine, resulted in a robust increase of surface-expressed PD-L1 on microglia (control = 8.6 %; IFN-\u03b3 = 92.9 %) ( Figure 3B ). These data confirmed previous reports that resting microglia express low levels of PD-L1 (Magnus et al. 2005) . As an positive control for microglial activation, we found that IFN-\u03b3-treatment induced microglial expression of MHC class II (control = 18.0 %; IFN-\u03b3 = 81.7 %) ( Figure 3C ). Both constitutive and INF-\u03b3induced MHC class I expression were also detected (control = 44.1 %; IFN-\u03b3 = 74.5%) ( Figure 3D ).",

Total BMNCs, which include CD4 + T-cells, CD8 + Tcells and microglia, were incubated with MCMV IE1 168-176 (0, 5, and 50 \u03bcM), which has previously been identified as a CD8 + T-cell-specific MHC class I restricted epitope (Del Val et al. 1988; Holtappels et al. 2002) , for 48 h and supernatants were analyzed for IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 via ELISA. MCMV IE1 168-176 stimulation alone resulted in a dose-dependent increase in CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 production (Figure 5 A, B) . Using PD-L1 neutralizing antibody, added 1 h prior to MCMV IE1 168-176 stimulation, we were able to specifically assess the role of PD-L1 on CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 production. In the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 increased dramatically, compared to untreated and IgG2a-treated control microglia; IFN-\u03b3 production in the presence of anti-PD-L1 antibody increased 72% (50 \u03bcM IE1) and 250% (5 \u03bcM IE1). Similarly, IL-2 production increased 20% (50 \u03bcM IE1) and 120% (5 \u03bcM IE1) above untreated and IgG2a-treated controls.",

A similar profile for chronic brain inflammation is reported in this study, where immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry show that approximately 30% of microglia continue to express the surrogate marker for glial cell activation, MHC class II, at 30 dpi (Figure 1) , long past clearance of active viral replication in the brain. We also confirmed previous findings that, as MCMV brain infection progressed from the productive phase into the chronic persistent phase, the percent of CD8 + T-cells within the CD45 + CD11b low leukocyte population increased from 30% (7 dpi) to 65% (30 dpi) (Figure 2 ), making CD8 + T-cells the predominant brain-infiltrating immune cell type following viral encephalitis.

PD-1 binding with the negative co-stimulatory molecule PD-L1, which is upregulated on antigen presenting cells, is a well-known mechanism for suppression of CD8 + T-cell proliferation and function (Dong et al. 1999; Kobata et al. 2000; Sharpe and Freeman 2002) . Microglia are the foremost antigen presenting cells of the brain, as evidenced through their expression of MHC class I and II in response to brain infection (Neumann 2001; Sedgwick et al. 1993) . As previously reported (Magnus et al. 2005 ), we found low basal expression of PD-L1 on microglia, approximately 20% of cells in uninfected mice expressed surface PD-L1 (Figure 1) . PD-L1 expression on microglia increased robustly during the acute stage of infection, coinciding with the infiltration of IFN-\u03b3-secreting CD8 + T-cells and increased CNS TNF\u03b1 (Cheeran et al. 2007) . Similarly, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF\u03b1 treatment increased PD-L1 on in vitro cultured microglia, confirming the role of those cytokines in PD-L1 upregulation (Figure 3) . Furthermore, we found that blockade of the PD-1 pathway with either PD-1 or PD-L1 neutralizing antibody, both in vitro and in ex vivo brain leukocyte extracts, resulted in increased CD8+ T-cell IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 production. These data demonstrate that microglia suppress CD8 + T-cell function, as indicated by IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 production, through the PD-1: PD-L1 pathway.",

To demonstrate this, in Figure 5 we assessed the effects of glialexpressed PD-L1 on CD8+ T-cells isolated from the brains of MCMV-infected mice at 14 dpi. In this experiment we used a MHC Class I restricted peptide for specific CD8+ T-cell restimulation (MCMV IE1168-176).

Similarly, Duncan et al. showed that microglia in the CNS during active Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, which is used as a model for multiple sclerosis, upregulate PD-L1. Using neutralizing antibody to PD-L1, they showed that ex vivo microglia suppressed CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell cytokine production through engagement of the T-cell PD-1 receptor. In vivo blockade of PD-L1, again using neutralizing antibody, resulted in decreased viral loads, but also caused an increase in mortality, presumably through exacerbated immune-mediated damage to the nervous system (Duncan and Miller 2011) . While these previous studies have primarily focused on PD-L1 in managing T-cell function during acute viral CNS infection, the present study shows the involvement of this negative regulatory pathway in inhibiting persistent CD8 + T-cell function during post-viral encephalitic chronic neuroinflammation. Specifically, treatment of isolated BMNCs, consisting of microglia and brain-infiltrating leukocytes, with PD-L1 neutralizing antibody increased the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 from MCMV-IE1 168-176 -stimulated memory CD8 + T-cells ( Figure 5) . These experiments were performed on cells extracted from MCMV-infected brains at 14 dpi, approximately 1 week following the clearance of active viral infection. To our knowledge, this is the first experiment demonstrating the role of microglial PD-L1 on inhibiting brain CD8 + T-cells during chronic neuroinflammation and in the absence of productive viral infection.",

In this study we corroborate previous findings that IFN-\u03b3 robustly upregulates MHC class II expression on purified cultures of murine astrocytes. In addition, we report that IFN-\u03b3 stimulation induced PD-L1 upregulation on purified astrocytes in vitro, suggesting the involvement of astrocytes as an additional immunosuppressive cell type. Indeed, Pittet et al. have previously shown that IFN-\u03b3 stimulation of purified cultures of human astrocytes induced surface PD-L1 expression, which suppress T-lymphocytes via engagement of PD-1 on the surface of CD8 cells (Pittet et al. 2011) . Furthermore, we confirmed that astrocytes regulate T-cells by inhibiting CD8 + T-cell cytokine production through the physical engagement of T-cell-expressed PD-1 and glial-expressed PD-L1 (Gold et al. 1996) . As techniques for isolating and culturing astrocytes from the brains of adult mice become available, ex vivo verification of T-cell suppression by astrocytes by this pathway will be required. Multiple studies have clearly shown that, in relation to effector Tcell stimulation, microglia are superior to astrocytes. IFN\u03b3 induces microglia expression of T-cell co-stimulatory molecules (CD80 & CD86) that are necessary second-signals for glia to functionally activate T-cells (Aloisi 2001) . To our knowledge, there have been no reports of astrocytes either expressing these co-stimulatory molecules or being able to effectively activate T-cells (Cross and Ku 2000) . Studies by Magnus et al., suggest that while astrocytes and microglia both inhibit T-cell function, the effect is more pronounced in the latter cell type (Magnus et al. 2005) . Our in vitro studies show that PD-L1 neutralization resulted in more potent recovery of CD8 + T-cell IFN-\u03b3 production in astrocyte co-cultures (2.4-fold increase) compared to microglia co-cultures (1.5-fold). PD-L1 neutralization had comparable effects on IL-2 production in both microglia and astrocyte co-cultures. These data suggest a more potent role for astrocytes in CD8 + T-cell suppression in the brain. Such conclusions, however, cannot be drawn from the experiments conducted in this study because of our inability to assess the percentage of PD-L1 expression on astrocytes in the post-encephalitic brain or to evaluate the effect of PD-L1 neutralization on astrocytes using ex vivo glial: BMNC co-cultures.",

Within the context of viral encephalitis, studies have shown that persistent microglial activation as well as CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell infiltration is associated with neurotoxicity and neurocognitive dysfunction, suggesting extended neuroinflammation may be harmful to the brain (Armien et al. 2010) . Conversely, maintaining an antigen-specific CD8 + T-cell population in the brain would aide in the rapid clearance of reactivated virus from latently infected neurons (Mutnal et al. 2012; Tsutsui et al. 1995) . Regardless of their purpose, this paper shows that brain cells actively contribute to the suppression of CD8 + T-cells and suggests that a new homeostatic environment is created in the post-encephalitic CNS that maintains elevated immune surveillance coupled with brain-cell mediated regulation of persistent adaptive immune cells. (A) CD8 + T-cells from uninfected Balb/c mice were placed into culture (2\u00d710 5 cells/well) wells coated with \u03b1-CD3 Abs (2 \u03bcg/mL). Cells were collected and analyzed at 0, 24 and 48 h for PD-1 receptor surface expression. Isotype = filled grey line. (B & C) Unstimulated CD8 T-cells (untreated) or CD3-stimulated CD8 + T-cells were transferred into co-culture with microglia that recieved an IFN-\u03b3 (200 Units/mL) pre-treatment for 8 h. CD8 + T-cells were added at a 10:1 CD8: glial cell ratio. Prior to CD8+ T-cell addition, co-cultures were left untreated (control) or treated for 2 h with \u03b1-PD-L1, \u03b1-PD-L2, or \u03b1-PD-1 neutralizing antibody. Treatment with rat IgG2a was used as a isotype antibody control. Supernatants were collected at 24 h and ELISA run for IFN-\u03b3 (B) and IL-2 (C). Histograms are representative of three separate experiments. *p \u2264 0.01. **p \u2264 0.001. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the brains of MCMV-infected Balb/c mice at 14 dpi (n = 5/group) and cultured (1.3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/well) in the presence of 0, 5, or 50 \u03bcM CD8specific MCMV-IE1 168-176 peptide. Prior to the addition of peptide the cultures were treated with PD-L1 neutralizing antibody (\u03b1-PD-L1; grey bars), control rat IgG isotype (IgG2a; white bars) or left untreated (black bars). Supernatants were collected after 48 h in culture with peptide and analyzed for IFN-\u03b3 (A) and IL-2 (B) levels (pg/mL). Data are representative of three separate experiments. **p \u2264 0.001. (untreated) or stimulated with anti-CD3 Abs for 1 hour prior to transfer into co-culture with purified astrocytes (anti-CD3 stimulated CD8 cells). Astrocyte cultures were pre-treated for 8 h with IFN-\u03b3 (200U/mL) to stimulated PD-L1 expression. CD8 + T-cells were added at a 10:1 CD8:glial cell ratio. Prior to CD8+ T-cell addition, astrocyte cultures were were left untreated (control) or treated for 2 h with \u03b1-PD-L1, \u03b1-PD-L2, or \u03b1-PD-1 neutralizing antibody. Treatment with rat IgG2a was used as a isotype antibody control.. Supernatants were collected at 24 h and ELISA run for IFN-\u03b3 (A) and IL-2 (B). Histograms are representative of 3 separate experiments. *p \u2264 0.01, **p \u2264 0.001.",
