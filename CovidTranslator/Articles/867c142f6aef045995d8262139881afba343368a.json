When seen it most frequently involves the caudal aspect of the soft palate; however the hard palate, lips and external nares may also be affected. The degree to which it is heritable is not well defined. Foals with large clefts may show dramatic nasal regurgitation of milk during nursing. In some cases, particularly those with relatively small clefts or clefts in the soft palate, nasal return of milk becomes obvious only after feeding and may be relatively minor in amount. Small clefts may not always be easily visible or produce significant nasal return of food and, occasionally, some are only detected after some years, when nasal reflux of grass and more solid food material may be present. Consequent rhinitis and nasal discharges may not be immediately identifiable as resulting from a cleft palate. Occasionally the cleft is sufficiently small to produce no detectable evidence and these are sometimes identified incidentally during clinical or post-mortem examinations. Large palatal defects in young foals have profound effects including failure to ingest adequate amounts of colostrum, starvation and inhalation pneumonia.",

The failure of significant occlusion results in an increasing overgrowth of the upper incisors and impingement of the mandibular teeth into the soft tissues of the hard palate. Individuals with lesser degrees of inferior brachygnathia may be less affected but the lingual edges of the lower incisors may become sharp and lacerate the gums and hard palate. More commonly the lower incisors tend to prolong the line of the lower jaw and the labial margins of the upper incisors become long and sharp and may lacerate the lower lip.

They are, however, ordinarily loose and easily removed. Total retention of the temporary molars is much less common. In some cases, the temporary tooth creates a dental cap on the permanent tooth which may be so persistent as to make their identification difficult. However, as the first cheek teeth are most commonly affected, it is usually possible to see the cap on the erupted permanent tooth. Persistent, temporary premolar caps overlying the erupting permanent teeth may occasionally cause oral discomfort and masticatory problems. In the event that these caps rotate there may be associated cheek swelling and in this case the displaced temporary cap will be easily visible. Under such circumstances more significant abnormalities of mastication may be present with quidding (spitting out of partially chewed food material) and reluctance to eat.

Obstructive disorders of the salivary ducts are usually restricted to the superficial (Stenson's duct) and intraglandular portions of the parotid duct. Obstructions are most often due to sialoliths lodged within the common duct, often in the more distal portion where it passes along the anterior border of the masseter muscle. Sialoliths are usually spherical or oval and consist of calcium carbonate deposited around a nidus created by a foreign body or inflammatory cells originating in the gland or duct. Their size is very variable. The actual size may, or may not, relate to the extent of the obstruction. Thus, some very small calculi may cause more severe obstructions than the obvious larger ones and this may be more a reflection of the speed of onset of the obstruction and the rate of development of the calculus. Continuous enlargement of sialoliths occurs over some years, as more and more mineral content is laid down. Most longstanding cases are those in which the obstruction is partial and saliva continues to pass around the mass. In these circumstances the secondary effects upon the gland are minimal. However, where there is abrupt and complete obstruction a dramatic and painful enlargement of the associated gland is usually induced. Occasionally there may be localized obstructions within the substance of the gland itself. Obstructions sufficiently severe to cause rupture of the duct or traumatic disruption of the Figure 1 .54 Acute obstruction of a major branch of the parotid duct by a calcium carbonate calculus (which was identified by radiography and ultrasonography) resulted in a gross, painful and hot swelling of the parotid salivary gland.

The most common causes of obstruction are the ingestion of food of abnormal consistency, and foreign bodies. Even small amounts of dry feed, such as (dry) sugar beet or cubed/pelleted feed, may cause intraluminal obstruction. Greedy feeders, horses which are poorly fed at irregular intervals, horses with prior esophageal trauma and those with dental disease are particularly liable to the condition. The condition is also relatively Obstructions due to firm foreign bodies such as corn cobs, rough straw, wood shavings, potatoes, apples, carrots, etc. are potentially more serious than the diffuse type of obstruction associated with dry roughage or beet pulp. These obstructions may be partial or complete, and the firm nature of most such objects results in significant local spasm of the esophagus around the foreign body. Variable degrees of mucosal ulceration develop. Limited depth (mucosal), longitudinal or linear ulceration is relatively common and may take the form of a single broad ulcer or multiple, finer, short, linear lesions. These shallow, mucosal ulcers have little long-term consequence and heal rapidly. Circumferential ulceration involving the mucosa only, or the mucosa and the superficial muscular layers, or more severe lesions affecting the deeper layers of the wall of the esophagus may be visualized endoscopically, and occurs particularly with rough or sharp foreign bodies. The circumferential nature of these lesions makes their long-term consequences more serious than the longitudinal ulcers. Fibrous (scar tissue) strictures commonly develop some days or weeks later.

While in most cases the extent of this muscular thickening is limited to the ileum itself, considerable secondary hypertrophy may be found in the distal segments of the jejunum, extending a considerable distance proximally. The presence of such a finding should alert the clinician to the possibility of chronic ileal or ileo-cecal obstructions. (Figs. 1.122 & 1.123) Simple obstructions of the large intestine tend to have a more gradual onset than those of the small intestine. Ingesta impactions of the large intestine occur at areas of reduced luminal diameter such as the pelvic flexure and right dorsal colon. These impactions are a common cause of persistent, mild or moderate colic. Occasional cases may be more severely affected, particularly where there is gaseous distension of the colon and cecum proximal to the obstruction.

However, unlike primary impactions, cecal bypass is not always indicated as long as the cecum looks healthy and the inciting cause (such as orthopedic pain) can be controlled. (Fig. 1.127) Ingestion of foreign bodies such as nylon carpeting or fibers from nylon-belt fences also affects the patency and progressive motility of the large and small colon in particular and may lead to obstruction. There are few pathognomonic features of these forms of colic but an accurate history may assist. Concretions of fecal material known as fecaliths (a hard mass of inspissated feces) or enteroliths (intestinal calculi formed of layers surrounding a nucleus of some hard indigestible substance) may be found in the colon of horses. Fecaliths are frequently formed when foreign bodies such as baler twine, rubber or nylon string/fibers are ingested with fecal material accumulating around the object to form large obstructing masses. They are usually formed in the large colon and most often result in simple luminal obstruction within the transverse or small colon. The more solid, rock-like concretions (enteroliths) are usually composed of ammonium and magnesium phosphate complexes and, although they are smoother, they may also cause intraluminal obstructions in the large and small colon. They have been associated with diets with elevated levels of magnesium and proteins. The Arabian breed appears to be at particular risk with cases also reported in donkeys, Morgans and Saddlebreds. Enteroliths are much slower to develop than fecaliths and may be found in any part of the colon although there is a predilection for right dorsal and transverse colon. The shape and location of the developing mass largely dictates the associated clinical signs. Thus, roughened and irregular enteroliths occurring in the cecum or large colon may have little or no pathological effect or may produce mild, recurrent episodes of colic associated with local bowel-wall irritation. The commoner larger, smoother enteroliths and fecaliths characteristically cause obstructions in the narrower portions of the large bowel including the pelvic flexure, transverse colon and small colon. Rarely, enteroliths may be multiple and smooth with flat sides. Some masses of limited size may be passed normally in the feces. Obstructions caused by enteroliths or fecaliths may be complete, when acute clinical signs associated with the gross proximal accumulation of gas and ingesta may be seen but are more usually incomplete. In the latter cases the clinical signs are similar to those of impactions at the relevant anatomical sites. Intermittent impactions may be associated with slow and intermittent movement of the object through the colon. Rough objects located within the cecum or large colon may not, however, have any obstructive effects but may cause quite extensive intermittent (and sometimes persistent) inflammation of these organs and each episode might be accompanied by significant colic symptoms.",

These loops frequently become adherent to each other in response to peritonitis and/or areas of infarction (ischemia or necrosis) within the bowel wall. Adhesions between different sections of the intestine or between the intestine and other abdominal organs, including the spleen and the parietal peritoneum, are common sequels to peritonitis or surgical interference, particularly where vascular compromise is present. The organization of these may lead to the development of non-elastic scar tissue bands which may create partial or complete, non-strangulating obstructions in any segment of the tract although the small intestine appears to be most commonly involved. While there may be no obstruction to the passage of food in the early stages, the impaired mobility and motility of the affected loops result in either a physical obstruction through narrowing or kinking or a functional obstruction with little or no ability to propel food onward. Post-prandial colic caused by intermittent partial obstruction of the jejunum and/or ileum is a common feature of developing or mature adhesions. Most cases affected by this type of disorder have a history of recurrent episodes of drug-responsive, mild or moderate, colic with a single, more acute, persistent episode, with signs typical of intraluminal small intestinal obstruction. It is unusual to find signs of active peritonitis. One of the more serious consequences of these adhesions, which may become densely fibrosed as scarring matures within them, is their liability to cause secondary strangulating obstructions.",

It is theorized that excess gas accumulation, perhaps in some cases combined with abnormal motility, causes the left colon to displace lateral to the spleen and then dorsally into the nephrosplenic space. In addition the colon is often rotated through 180\u00b0 such that the left ventral colon is in a more dorsal position relative to the left dorsal colon. The entrapped portion may be only the pelvic flexure or involve a large portion of the ascending colon. Gastric distension is also thought to predispose to left dorsal displacement by pushing the spleen into a more medial than normal position thus allowing easier migration of the colon along the abdominal wall. While in most cases there is little vascular compromise, the progressive accumulation of food material in the right ventral colon, and progressive gas accumulation in the entrapped distal colon, result in continuous though frequently mild colic. Fecal output is reduced. Few cases show gross distension of the abdomen but cecal tympany is common and gastric distension may be present 2) Right dorsal displacement (RDD) (Fig. 1.148) . Displacement may occur clockwise or anticlockwise. The former is more common and occur when the pelvic flexure is displaced between the cecum and body wall in a cranial to caudal direction. This may then progress with further medial and cranial movement of the pelvic flexure with the result that the pelvic flexure comes to lie near the diaphragm. Anticlockwise displacements occur when the pelvic flexure travels in a caudal to cranial direction; in this case the pelvic flexure may also come to lie close to the diaphragm. 3) Retroflexion.

Strangulating lesions are much more common in the small intestine than in other segments of the gut. The extent and significance of these disorders depend largely on the degree of vascular compromise, but most of them are life-threatening. The affected portion of the intestine is often devitalized rapidly. Initially, the venous drainage of the affected portion is impaired and localized swelling and edema cause progressively more severe arterial obstruction. Ischemia of the gut then results in localized spasm of the affected length and there is a consequent accumulation of gas and fluid proximal to the obstruction. Severe gastric distension is a common sequel which develops rapidly. Gross, intraluminal distension of the bowel results in further ischemia and disruption of the protective mucosal layers. Loss of protein-rich fluid into the lumen and passage of endotoxins into the peritoneal fluid and bloodstream occur early. The systemic consequences of these changes are profound. Hypovolemic and endotoxic shock accompanied by electrolyte and acidbase deviations occur and are responsible for the continuing metabolic collapse of the patient. Vascular compromise and capillary necrosis result in the loss of high-protein fluid containing both red and white cells into the abdomen. Peritoneal fluid is usually bloodstained and has a high protein concentration and raised total leucocyte count. Typically, affected horses have an acute onset of severe and unrelenting, non-drug-responsive abdominal pain. Where the lesion occurs in the proximal segments of the small intestine, progression is particularly rapid and is usually accompanied by gastric distension resulting from reflux of alkaline intestinal fluid into the stomach. Lesions occurring further down the small intestine have a somewhat slower course but all have a characteristically rapid progression over 1-12 hours. The extent of pain shown by these cases finally becomes less severe due to devitalization of the distended and damaged intestine. Critical clinical assessment confirms that the apparent improvement is not a result of resolution of the underlying problem, and that cardiovascular compromise and terminal shock are imminent. Most affected horses will die within 24-36 hours unless treated effectively.",

Rectal examination of horses suffering from epiploic foramen entrapment is often somewhat disappointing but it is the ileum and terminal portions of the jejunum which are usually involved early in the disorder. Tension applied to the ventral tenial band of the cecum per rectum will often elicit a sharp pain response in these cases. (Figs. 1.158-1.163) Intussusception of a length of small intestine and its associated mesentery most commonly involves the more distal jejunum or the ileum, and is most often encountered in young horses. A history of move more easily in and out of the hernial ring. Clinical signs of bowel entrapment include increased swelling of the hernia, heat, pain and difficulty in reduction. Small intestine is most commonly involved but cecum or colon can also become incarcerated within the hernia. In some cases, only a portion of the bowel wall may be affected; these are known as Richter's hernias and may lead to the development of enterocutaneous fistulas. In entire stallions (and rarely in geldings) loops of small intestine may become incarcerated in the inguinal canal or scrotum. The disorder is common and of relatively minor significance in the neonatal foal which often has significant lengths of small bowel herniated through the inguinal canal and lying within the enlarged scrotum. Lesser or greater lengths of intestine appear to have considerable freedom to move in and out of the inguinal canal and the condition usually resolves spontaneously over the first few weeks of life. In some foals, and in adult horses, the disorder is, however, extremely serious. Severe strangulating colic may result with gross asymmetrical enlargement of the scrotum associated with edema and swelling of the ipsilateral testicle. Open castration of horses affected by inguinal hernias or those with an abnormally wide inguinal canal may result in serious herniation of variable lengths of small intestine. diarrhea may be present, particularly in foals, although the onset of the intussusception and related colic signs is acute. Parasitism may be an instigating factor (see below). Intussusception of the jejunum into itself, or into the ileum or cecum, results in few changes in the peritoneal fluid as the length of damaged bowel (intussusceptum) is firmly enclosed in the distal segment (intussuscipiens). However, the proximal small intestine rapidly becomes significantly distended and gastric distension with its attendant dangers may also develop.",

There is little or no alteration in the peritoneal fluid in these cases, so that diagnosis may be difficult and is often dependent on rectal examination or laparotomy. The detection, per rectum, of distended small intestine and a large, sausage-shaped, solid object within the cecum is usually pathognomonic.

Also, there is insignificant hindrance to the passage of food material into the large colon and, although affected horses are anorexic and have mild, recurrent or persistent colic, feces of normal consistency usually continue to be passed. These may, however, contain evidence of intestinal bleeding. The clinical signs of colic in these animals are therefore less severe and slower in progression, but the long-term consequences are no less dangerous. Rectal examination is often unremarkable but the presence of melena (dark tarry feces containing changed blood) may be a significant finding for this and other types of intussusception. (Figs. 1.164-1.166) These may also be responsible for the development of strangulating lesions. In the acquired defects, such as mesenteric tears or rents, incarceration probably occurs at the time of the damage to the mesentery. Most of these probably arise from physical tearing during falls, or from blows, but many have no such history. Fig. 1 .97) and pedunculated lipomas These may arise from the mesentery or from the serosal surface of the small intestine, and are common causes of incarceration and strangulation of small intestine or small colon. Lipomas of significant size are most often encountered in horses over the age of 15 years, but while many horses have large and/or numerous lipomas without any untoward effect, some small and relatively innocuous-looking masses have serious consequences. Younger horses may also be affected. The most dangerous forms of lipoma are those with long pedicles and while in some cases this may cause extreme and complete strangulation of small intestine or small colon, others may have a lesser effect from tension within the pedicle. The latter are more commonly associated with large lipoma masses with relatively long pedicles. The body condition of the horse is not reliably related to the presence of lipomas with some horses in moderate body condition having large masses while some inordinately fat horses may have no, or a few, small lipomas. Rotations through more than 180\u00b0, along the long axis of the mesenteric attachment (volvulus), initially result in impairment of blood supply and, later, obstruction of the lumen of the affected portion. These lesions often occur secondarily to some other obstructive or incarcerative condition such as Meckel's diverticulum, adhesions, infarctions or mesenteric rents. Continued twisting of the affected loop results in progressive vascular compromise and luminal obstruction. The loop becomes devitalized, while the segments proximal to the obstruction become filled with gas and fluid. Where the affected loop of jejunum or ileum becomes knotted rather than merely twisted upon itself, the term volvulus nodosus is applied. These strangulating obstructive lesions are easily recognized but it is difficult to understand how they are formed. It is presumed that the underlying cause is basically a defect of motility. The clinical features are typical of severe and complete strangulating obstruction with proximal distension and distal emptying of the bowel. Peritoneal fluid is usually indicative of strangulation lesions (see p. 54). Again, there is a considerable risk of gastric distension and consequent gastric rupture.",

This stage is often followed by a period when less pain will be shown associated with intestinal devitalization and impending death. Gross abdominal distension may not, however, be a major feature of the disorder, although in some cases this may be present. Rectal examination is usually diagnostic, and will at least identify that a large number of loops of small intestine are grossly dilated, tense and, in the early stages, painful to the touch. In this condition the loops of distended jejunum will be felt lying next to each other as can be demonstrated clearly at post-mortem examination. (Fig. 1.174) Torsion of the cecum alone is much less common than small intestinal torsion and entrapments; most being related to large colon torsion. As there is a poor collateral blood supply, vascular compromise occurs rapidly. The amount of distension of the organ may be limited. Peritoneal fluid usually provides evidence of a strangulating obstruction but fecal output may be little affected. Rectal examination is often disappointing but a distended cecum with an edematous wall may be identifiable. (Figs. 1.175 & 1.176) These are variable in their extent and effect upon the horse. The degree of rotation and consequent vascular and luminal obstruction largely dictates the rate of onset and progression and the severity of the clinical signs. Thus, rotations of less than 90\u00b0 may present with no apparent vascular obstruction, and relatively minor luminal interference. Such displacements are best regarded as physiological and probably occur frequently. Rotations of between 90\u00b0 and 180\u00b0 cause increased, but often insignificant, luminal obstruction. Under these conditions it may be impossible to identify the disorder except by careful examination of the position and appearance of the colon at laparotomy. Torsion of 180-270\u00b0 will obstruct the lumen and impair blood supply (and venous drainage, in particular), while degrees of rotation greater than this probably represent the most rapidly ",

Under these circumstances there may be spontaneous reflux of gastric fluid and large amounts of gastric reflux can usually be released by the passage of a nasogastric tube. The clinical signs are otherwise similar to gastric distension due to other causes. Significant gastric distension may, also, be due to the accumulation of gas/air in horses affected by the neurosis, windsucking (aerophagia), although in these the stomach is usually chronically distended and non-painful. Horses subject to this vice are often not hungry in spite of poor condition and show no other evidence of disease. They seldom show colic as a result of gastric distension but gross swallowing of air may result in clinically significant, recurrent, and occasionally acutely painful distension in the more distal alimentary tract.

There are several reasons for this, but foremost it is important to recognize that the mere presence of parasites such as strongyles, ascarids or tapeworms does not necessarily lead to disease. These parasite categories should be considered ubiquitous in equine establishments world-over, but parasitic disease is the rare event rather than the rule. In other words, parasites are likely to be present in a horse with colic or diarrhea without a causal relationship. Second, the adult egg-shedding parasites are not necessarily the stages causing disease in the horse. A couple of examples are cyathostomin larvae causing larval cyathostominosis or migrating stages of Strongylus vulgaris causing thromboembolic colic. The adult stages of strongyle are only considered mild pathogens, while there currently are no diagnostic methods available for detecting the larval stages. Moreover, strongyle-type eggs cannot be told apart by size or morphological characteristics. In principle, a strongyle egg could represent any of the over 50 different strongyle species described infecting horses. The large strongyles (including Strongylus vulgaris, S. edentatus and S. equinus) can be diagnosed by culturing fecal samples and subsequently identifying the third-stage larvae to the species level. Recent validations using retrospective data have shown that egg counts and larval cultures generally have high positive predictive values (>0.90) but that the negative predictive values were more moderate (about 0.75). This underlines the fact that a horse with a negative fecal egg count or larval culture may still harbor adult strongyle parasites. The same study illustrated that horses in the 0-500 strongyle egg count range had significantly smaller worm burdens compared to horses with higher egg counts. This supports the use of fecal egg counts for treatment decisions.",

Each horse can be said to possess a certain strongyle contaminative potential (SCP), and a few egg counts performed over time will allow classification of any given herd into low (often <200 EPG), medium (often 200-500 EPG) and high shedders (>500 EPG).

However, the large majority of adult horses will have egg counts below this level. For this reason, a technique with a minimum detection limit of 50 EPG or above is not useful for the FECRT. It is generally recommended to use egg count techniques with detection limits of 25 EPG or below, but lower is always better.

If eggs are found, they should be regarded as the tip of the iceberg, and many more could be recovered with a modified technique. The basic modification employed for detecting tapeworms is to increase the amount of feces examined. Whereas a routine McMaster procedure typically uses 4 g of feces, 30-40 g of feces are examined to increase the likelihood of finding tapeworm eggs. Furthermore, the more effective tapeworm methods use enhanced flotation with coverslips sitting on top of centrifuge tubes. This often requires a centrifuge with a closed swing-bucket rotor to prevent coverslips from being dislodged. Some studies have reported that examination of fecal samples 24 hours after tapeworm treatment yielded higher Anoplocephala egg counts and a higher percentage of positive samples. Presumably, segments from dead tapeworms disintegrate within the host gut and release eggs into the feces. The highest diagnostic sensitivity reported for an egg counting technique for detection of tapeworm eggs is 61%. This, however, means that the method has a 39% chance of a false-negative result. However, these findings were based on detection of cestode burdens of all sizes. If this threshold were adjusted to detect 20 or more tapeworms, the diagnostic sensitivity increases to about 90%. In other words, only 10% of tapeworm burdens of 20 or more worms would be missed with this method. The choice of 20 tapeworms as a cutoff level is supported by the fact that no or very little mucosal pathology is observed with tapeworm burdens of fewer than 20 worms.",

In a more subtropical climate the dynamics are markedly different, and arrested development of cyathostomins appears to occur more during the summer. 3) Anthelmintic treatment: treatment with a non-larvicidal drug such as ivermectin or pyrantel has been identified as a significant risk factor for triggering the disease.

It is caused by migration of larval stages of Strongylus vulgaris, the bloodworm. This parasite was once reported present in 80-100% of horses but has now become extremely rare in managed horse populations. As a result, thromboembolic colic is rarely encountered nowadays. However, it can still occur if parasite control is inadequate. S. vulgaris larvae migrate to the cranial mesenteric artery (CMA), where they dwell for about 4 months. During this time, they eventually molt to the fifth stage and subsequently travel by the bloodstream to the large intestine where they penetrate the intestinal wall to finally reach the intestinal lumen. The life cycle is complete after about 6.5 months, when the female worms start shedding eggs in the intestine. In the CMA, the larvae cause a verminous endarteritis with roughened intima and thrombus formation. Despite these pronounced alterations, most horses with these lesions show no clinical symptoms. Thromboembolism, however, can be the cause of serious disease. Small thrombi can detach from the main thrombus and will be carried down the vessel tree by the bloodstream. Here, they can eventually occlude an artery or arteriole, which can cause ischemia and infarction in larger or smaller segments of the intestinal tract. Infarction is painful and most descriptions of thromboembolic colic depict a very painful colic with heart rates often around 100 beats per minute, cyanotic mucous membranes, profuse sweating and signs of cardiovascular shock. Abdominal taps will often reveal elevated measures of protein content and white blood cell counts as signs of the inflammatory condition in the intestinal wall. In some cases, the infarcted area will eventually rupture with the characteristic finding of intestinal contents in the abdominal tap. Milder forms of the disease complex exist, with some horses showing a slowly progressing quiet colic, which initially appears to respond well to standard colic management, but recurs when the effect of the analgesics wears off. As the peritonitis develops, the clinical condition will gradually worsen. In some horses, localized lesions with fibrotic adhesions or strictures are occasionally encountered without any history of violent colic.",

Most geographical and climatic locations feature a distinct grazing season with a clearly defined offseason where horses are instead fed roughage in barns and/or paddocks. In a northern temperate climate, the off-season will occur during the colder winters, while in subtropical and tropical climates, the summers may be too hot for grazing. During such off-seasons, there will be very little or no parasite transmission, and there is no justification for rigorous anthelmintic treatments during this period. Some climates allow year-round transmission, where no off-season can be defined.",

            "text": "Anthelmintic treatments during the horse's first year of life. When a foal hits the ground, there is a certain order of parasites that it encounters during its first year of life. As each parasite category requires its own treatment considerations, it is worth keeping this order of appearance in mind: 1) Strongyloides westeri. Foals acquire this parasite through the mother's milk during the first weeks of life. However, it is rarely encountered nowadays and there is little evidence that suggests any pathogenic effects. Therefore it is not recommended to treat foals or mares for S. westeri. 2) Parascaris equorum. This is the primary parasitic pathogen of foals. Treatments should be carried out at 2-3 months of age with a benzimidazole drug to minimize the risk of small-intestinal impaction. 3) Cyathostomins. Foals start grazing during the first months of life, and will begin to acquire a strongyle burden. The first time to consider treatment of this burden is around the time of weaning, which is often at the age of 6 months. However, P. equorum can still be predominating at this age, so fecal samples are recommended to investigate the presence of this parasite. Ivermectin is often the drug of choice for strongyles, but other drug classes can be used, if there are no signs of resistance against them. Benzimidazoles are still the recommended drug type for P. equorum, but they cannot be expected to work against strongyles without performing a FECRT clearly showing a satisfactory efficacy. 4) Tapeworms. Foals are likely to encounter tapeworms when they start grazing, but there may be considerable differences in the level of exposure between individual farms. It is most often recommended to include tapeworm treatment once or twice yearly. The radiograph shows the extensive bone destruction. An attempt to perform a rostral mandibulectomy was unsuccessful and she was euthanized. Teeth included in the proliferating mass may become loose or displaced. Most occur in mature horses without sex or breed predilection. A congenital ameloblastoma which may include teeth and tooth-like material is exceptional. Osteogenic neoplasms are rare and most (osteoma, ossifying fibroma), although unsightly, are often slow-growing or static. They are sometimes associated with defects of dental eruption or trauma. More than 80% of equine osteosarcomas occur in the head region.",

Horses affected with the acute form invariably die within 24-48 hours of onset, in spite of the best nursing efforts. 2) Subacute form. These horses do not develop gastric and small intestinal distension but have marked large colon impactions. They have intermittent colic and patchy sweating and may have rhinitis sicca. The clinical course is usually 3-7 days. 3) Chronic form. The course of the chronic form is weeks to months.Progressive desiccation of the contents of the hypomotile colon results in dramatically reduced fecal output and hard, black, pelleted feces are characteristic. These are often covered with a slimy mucus, indicative of prolonged small colon transfer time. Although colonic hypomotility is the usual finding, occasional cases of grass sickness develop profuse diarrhea (pre sumably as a result of the deranged motility). Paralysis of the esophagus and consequent dysphagia are also common features. Dysphagia and dramatic weight loss result in a boarded, tucked-up abdomen.
