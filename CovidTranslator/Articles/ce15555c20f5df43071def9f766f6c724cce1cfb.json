Unlike other respiratory viruses, little is known about the clinical significance of human coronavirus infection (HCoV) in this population. We retrospectively identified all HSCT recipients who were transplanted between May 2013 and June 2017 at our institution and characterized the cumulative incidence of post-transplant HCoV infection. Of 678 patients who underwent HSCT during the study period, 112 (17%) developed HCoV infection, making HCoV the fourth most common respiratory viral infection. Thirty-four (30%) HCoV-infected patients progressed to proven or probable lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Age \u226550, graft-versus-host disease, corticosteroids, hypoalbuminemia, and inpatient status at the time of infection were independently associated with progression to LRTI. Twenty-seven (59%) patients who underwent repeat NP swab had persistent viral shedding for \u226521 days, with a median duration of 4 weeks of viral shedding. We conclude that HCoV is common and clinically significant in HSCT recipients, with nearly one-third of patients progressing to proven or probable LRTI. Evaluating for LRTI risk factors found in this study may identify patients who require closer surveillance and aggressive supportive care when infected with HCoV.",

In HSCT recipients, however, the incidence of post-transplant infection, symptomatology, risk of and risk factors for progression to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and respiratory failure are largely unknown. Furthermore, the clinical and microbiological risk factors for clinical deterioration in this population are also unknown. This information would assist clinicians in identifying HSCT recipients with HCoV infection who have the highest risk of clinical deterioration and thus warrant closer monitoring. Furthermore, these data would inform and optimize the design of future clinical trials of novel anti-HCoV therapies [4] . Therefore, we conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of HSCT recipients at our institution who were infected with HCoV. We report the incidence, epidemiology, and outcomes of these patients, as well as the risk factors associated with progression to proven or probable LRTI.",

We found that HCoV infection is common after HSCT, occurring in approximately one out of 6 HSCT recipients at our medical center. We found that older age, corticosteroid use, hypoalbuminemia, and inpatient status were significantly associated with proven or probable LRTI. Additionally, prolonged viral shedding was detected in 59% of patients who underwent subsequent NP swab. We are aware of only two previously published reports of the incidence of HCoV infection in adult HSCT recipients, and these reports analyzed fewer than 300 patients in total [3, 5] . In this study of nearly 700 HSCT recipients, symptomatic HCoV infection occurred in 17% of patients, surpassed in incidence only by rhinovirus/ enterovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza infections. This cumulative incidence is consistent with the 11-23% incidence reported in prior studies of HSCT recipients [3, 5] . The serotype most frequently detected in our population over the duration of the study was OC43, accounting for 40% of all infections, and least common one was 229E (14%). This serotype profile is similar to what has been noted at other institutions in a wide variety of geographical locations [2, 3, [6] [7] [8] . Furthermore, all serotypes demonstrated winter seasonality, consistent with prior reports [3, 5] . Data regarding the severity of HCoV infection in HSCT recipients in previous reports are limited, but our finding that 30% of patients had proven or probable LRTI is compatible with findings from prior studies [3, 5] . The high rate of proven or probable LRTI in this patient population indicates that HCoV infection may have greater clinical significance and severity in HSCT recipients than previously thought. Like prior studies, co-infection with another respiratory pathogen was common in patients with HCoV [2, 3] . In fact, 59% of patients with proven or probable LRTI harbored a co-infection with another respiratory pathogen detected on NP swab (P < 0.001). Three potential explanations for this finding are (1) HCoV infection increases susceptibility to infections by other pathogens; (2) co-infection with other respiratory pathogens increases the likelihood of progression to LRTI; or (3) co-infections increase the likelihood of obtaining chest CTs or bronchoscopies, which lead to the detection of LRTI. Importantly, we found that on subgroup analysis of those patients with a proven or probable LRTI, coinfection with another respiratory virus was not associated with respiratory failure, death at 30 days or death at 90 days, indicating that severity of a proven or probable HCoV LRTI is independent of co-infection.",

These factors may be general indicators of frailty and susceptibility for more severe infection and may highlight individuals in whom to more closely surveille and target treatment interventions in the future. Interestingly, underlying lung disease with COPD or asthma did not appear to be associated with progression to LRTI; however, the number of patients in our study with these comorbidities was limited. It is well documented in the literature that influenza, RSV, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza viruses are associated with prolonged viral shedding in HSCT recipients, but the persistence of HCoV shedding in HSCT recipients is poorly understood [1, 10, 11] . While a \"test of cure\" is not routinely performed at our institution, patients undergo repeat NP swabs for worsening or recurrent symptoms. We found that of patients with follow-up respiratory swabs, 59% had persistent shedding of the virus, defined as shedding for \u226521 days after initial infection. No one serotype was significantly associated with persistent viral shedding, consistent with what Ogimi et al. observed in their HSCT population [12] . Additionally, the median duration of shedding in our cohort was 4 weeks, as compared to the 3 weeks described by Ogimi et al. [12] . Milano et al. found that in HSCT recipients with asymptomatic HCoV infection, the median duration of viral shedding was 4 weeks [5] . It is difficult to compare our cohort to others reported in the literature because (1) we did not screen asymptomatic individuals for infection, and (2) we did not test for persistent infection; repeat NP swab was only obtained for worsening or new respiratory symptoms. While the clinical relevance of prolonged viral shedding remains unclear, understanding the risk factors and duration of shedding has implications for infection control in this highly vulnerable population. Further research is needed to better understand the mechanisms and clinical significance of prolonged HCoV shedding.",

First, because it is retrospective, we may not have captured patients with mild symptoms who were not tested, leading us to underestimate the incidence of HCoV infection. The potential for missing mild cases may have also led us to overestimate the risk of progression to LRTI. However, our center had a policy of collecting NP swabs to assess for respiratory viral infection in all HSCT recipients with new respiratory symptoms during the study period. Second, only 11 patients underwent bronchoscopy, so presence or absence of HCoV in the lower respiratory tract was not discerned in most of the patients. However, given that pneumonia is a clinical diagnosis, we relied on the combination of clinical and radiographic findings to diagnose probable LRTI (13) . Last, a test of cure for respiratory viruses is not standard-ofcare at our institution. Therefore, only patients who had persistent symptoms or recurrent symptoms at a follow-up visit or during hospitalization underwent repeat NP swab at varying intervals. Thus, our data on persistent HCoV shedding may be underestimated, and prospective studies are needed to further evaluate this. This is the largest study to date characterizing HCoV infections in HSCT recipients. We demonstrated that HCoV infection in HSCT recipients is common and clinically significant, with nearly one-third of patients progressing to a proven or probable LRTI. We described factors that appear to be associated with progression LRTI, defining a subpopulation of HSCT recipients that may benefit from closer monitoring and aggressive supportive care when infected with HCoV. Furthermore, this may represent a population in which to target an HCoV antiviral agent in future clinical trials. Prospective studies on HCoV infection in HSCT recipients are needed to further delineate risk factors for LRTI and prolonged viral shedding.",
