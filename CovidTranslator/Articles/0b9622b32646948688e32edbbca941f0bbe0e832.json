            "text": "TGEV is a coronavirus that is still widely spread in pig farming. On molecular level this virus has been studied in detail. However, studying TGEV infection within the complexity of the porcine intestinal epithelium reveals difficulties due to limiting infection models. Here we established a new ex vivo model to analyze the enterotropism of TGEV in porcine intestinal tissue. Precision cut intestinal slices (PCIS) were produced and ATP level was measured to proof vitality of the slices. ATP measurements and HE staining revealed living tissue in culture for up to 24 h. PCIS were infected with three different TGEV strains. TGEV PUR 46-MAD is a commonly used TGEV strain that is known to be attenuated. TGEV Miller was passaged in piglets several times to reveal high infection. Finally, TGEV GFP is a recombinant strain that obtained its main body from TGEV PUR 46-MAD, but its spike protein from TGEV PUR-C11 that showed high mortality in piglets in vivo. Our results were in complete consensus of these statements. TGEV Miller mildly and TGEV GFP extensively infected the cells in the jejunum based on the amount of positive stained epithelial cells. However, for TGEV PUR 46-MAD no nucleocapsid protein was detected in the epithelial cells of the tissue. This shows that differences in TGEV strains and their infectious potential are highly dependent on their S protein.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis in swine is characterized by vomiting and severe diarrhea causing death in piglets within the first weeks of age (Laude et al., 1993; Wesley et al., 1991) . Virus infection leads to destruction of the epithelial cell layer at the tips of the jejunal villi of newborn piglets (Thake, 1968) . Most studies on TGEV infection are based on permanent cell lines (Rudiger et al., 2016; Tuboly et al., 2000) or are dependent on swine in vivo models (Chai et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2016; Woods and Wesley, 1986) . In general, primary intestinal cell culture systems to study pathogenesis are still very limiting in the way that isolated cells are low in recovery and difficult to culture (de Graaf et al., 2010; Sirinarumitr et al., 1996) . A relatively new method is the production of precision cut intestinal slices (PCIS) that are used in the field of toxicology (de Graaf et al., 2010) . PCIS are explants of tissue, cultured ex vivo, that allow an intercellular and cell-matrix interaction of all cells in the tissue (de Graaf et al., 2010) . These slices are produced to stay vital in culture and have been already used to study the intestinal tissue in smaller species like rodents (Niu et al., 2014) . So far they have been established in rat, mouse, and human jejunum (Pham et al., 2015) . Here for the first time, we established porcine jejunum PCIS and demonstrate that they can be infected by different TGEV strains. The TGEV strain PUR46-MAD is known to be attenuated by cell passaging over the years, but is still widely used in cell culture infection systems (Sanchez et al., 1999) . TGEV Miller (MIL65), the second strain, is a virulent cell-passaged strain (Bohl et al., 1972) . The third strain used in our study is TGEV GFP, a recombinant TGEV strain that includes the green fluorescent protein (Almazan et al., 2000) . Our study showed that porcine PCIS can be used for TGEV infection. PCIS are a valuable tool to analyze the enterotropism of TGEV and can be potentially used for the study of other pathogens that cause gastrointestinal diseases. ",

Jejunum from ca. 25 kg German landrace piglets was used (n = 11). Tissue was collected directly after euthanasia of swine. KHB Buffer and WME medium were prepared and oxygenated in advance. Swine intestine was transported in freshly oxygenated KHB buffer on ice. After transport intestinal tissue was flushed with ice-cold PBS to remove fecal residuals and transferred into freshly oxygenated KHB buffer on ice. Preparation of cores of porcine intestine was done as described for human intestine (de Graaf et al., 2010) . The intestine pieces were then embedded into 6% low melting agarose with RPMI (AGAROSE LM; GERBU, Gaiberg, Germany) and put on ice for 20 min (Fig. 1A) . During this time, the Krumdiek tissue slicer (TSE systems, model MD4000-01) was prepared and flushed twice with cold KHB. Subsequently, the agarose cylinders containing the tissue were removed from the syringe tubes (Fig. 1B) . Suited pieces were stamped out to the fitting diameter of the Krumdiek tissue slicer (Fig. 1C ). Slices were cut with a cycle speed of 60 slices/min and were apparently 250 \u03bcm thick (Fig. 1D ). PCIS were collected in a 24 well plate filled with 1 ml WME medium per well with 2-3 PCIS. Slices rested for 30 min in an incubator flushed with carbogen. Afterwards, PCIS were used for infection experiments. Table 1 summarizes the number of swines per time point used for PCIS preparation and the different experimental setups. Krimmling et al.

TGEV PUR46 has been isolated initially in 1946 at the Purdue University Indiana, USA (Doyle and Hutchings, 1946) . The TGEV PUR46-MAD strain used in this study was passaged 128 times in porcine cell cultures (after around 11 times in swine) and is known to be attenuated (Bohl et al., 1972; Sanchez et al., 1990 Sanchez et al., , 1999 . TGEV GFP rPUR46-C11 (TGEV GFP) is a recombinant TGEV PUR46-MAD where the S gene is replaced by the TGEV virulent strain PUR46-SW11-ST2-C11 (Almazan et al., 2000; Sanchez et al., 1999) . This virulent TGEV PUR46 had the same origin than PUR46-MAD from Purdue University and was passaged 11 times in swine and two times in porcine cell culture. The virulent C11 was obtained after plaque purification and highly replicates in the porcine enteric tract (Sanchez et al., 1999) . For the described study the TGEV GFP was passaged two times in ST cells. TGEV Miller is a virulent cellpassaged strain of TGEV, isolated from young pig small intestine (Bohl et al., 1972; Sanchez et al., 1990) . This virulent MIL65 strain was isolated in 1965 in the USA, passaged 13 times in porcine cell culture, 5 times in gnotobiotic pigs, and 6 times on ST cells prior to be used for this study. All virus strains were provided by Luis Enjuanes. A volume of 300 \u03bcl of the different TGEV strains was used for the inoculation of one well containing two PCIS. For TGEV GFP 2.16 \u00d7 10 5 PFU/ml, for TGEV Miller 1.9 \u00d7 10 6 PFU/ml and for TGEV PUR46-MAD 4.11 \u00d7 10 7 PFU/ml were added. After 1 h of infection, virus suspension was removed and 1 ml WME per well was added. Infected PCIS as well as uninfected controls were incubated in a carbogen gassed incubator for 9 h, 12 h, 16 h and 24 h.",

PCIS have an ellipse shape where the villi always pull over to the outside because of the muscularis mucosae. For vitality ATP concentration of the slices was measured by relative luminescence units (RLU). To compare the values we used ATP tenfold dilutions starting at 16500 \u03bcM. Directly after PCIS production the highest value of ca 0.63 \u03bcM ATP was measured. Further time points at 3, 9, 12, 16, and 24 h showed lower ATP values (Fig. 3) .

We were able to produce intestinal tissue slices that are from porcine origin by following the protocol for human PCIS described by de Graaf et al. This method gives new impact on studying not only viral infections in porcine intestine but also other research fields like pharmacological or toxicological matters. As de Graaf et al. described, it is the best way to use non-solid organs like the intestine by embedding them in agarose to form solid-like structures (de Graaf et al., 2010) . The surrounding agarose protects the PCIS from handling and cutting procedures and allows a reproducible cutting process with consistent thickness of the PCIS. Adjusting the level of agarose from 3% to 6% showed to be the best concentration for the production of porcine PCIS. Manipulation of the incubator by inserting a flexible tube to adjust the carbogen level inside the chamber revealed the best possible condition for the slices. However, the gas influx also caused temperature issues for the PCIS. This can be prevented by storing gassed medium in an incubator one hour before usage or generally light gas influx in big chambers that do not cause any temperature change. Gas washing bottles filled with 37\u00b0C distilled water do also prevent cooling down of samples as well as a dry atmosphere for the samples (de Graaf et al., 2010) . Best results were obtained by reducing the carbogen influx to a minimum level, while starting it before samples were set in the incubator. The survival time of porcine PCIS may be improved by the use of incubators with automated oxygenation. Additionally the culture medium might be optimized by supplemental compounds leading to longer vitality of PCIS.",

Furthermore, ATP levels seem to stagnate after more than 16 h. Supported are these findings by the HE staining showing intact epithelial layers of the PCIS after 24 h in culture, but also after virus infection.

Almazan et al. compared viral replication of PUR46-MAD with PUR46-C11 and the recombinant TGEV strain rPUR46-MAD-SC11. TGEV PUR46-MAD replicated to a low extent in the jejunum of infected piglets (< 10 3 PFU/g jejunum) compared to PUR46-C11 and the recombinant TGEV (> 10 6 PFU/g jejunum). Furthermore, the recombinant TGEV PUR46-MAD-SC11 led to 100% mortality in infected piglets 3 days after inoculation whereas TGEV PUR46-MAD caused no mortality in piglets. The recombinant TGEV GFP strain used in our study showed the most revealing infection of the PCIS, which is in correlation of the designed strain that was described as being suitable for tissue specific expression systems (Almazan et al., 2000) . The dependence of infection on the S protein has already been proven (Almazan et al., 2000) . This is in accordance with our studies showing a high infection rate of the PCIS by TGEV GFP compared to TGEV PUR-MAD. The TGEV Miller strain (MIL65) is a virulent strain passaged in piglets (see Materials and Methods). Animals infected with this virus showed inappetence, depression, and diarrhea (Bohl et al., 1972) . The Miller strain mildly infected the PCIS. This reduced infection can be explained by a reduction of enteropathogenicity due to the last 6 cell culture passages that were performed in our lab. Nevertheless MIL65 can still replicate in the intestine (see Fig. 2 ). In conclusion, by infection of PCIS it is possible to mimic jejunum infection with enteropathogenic coronaviruses.",

Therefore, the PCIS system can be a useful tool not only to analyze virus entry and enterotropism but also to monitor new isolated viruses for their enteropathogenicity without the need of an in vivo study.
