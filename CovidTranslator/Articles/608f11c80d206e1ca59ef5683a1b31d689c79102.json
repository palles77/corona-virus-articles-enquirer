The son of a protestant minister, he had a strong sense of mission, which was reinforced by his dislike of industrial society and his work as lay preacher among poor coal miners in Belgium. That experience with human misery influenced his art, which had an air of mysticism and austerity and, like that of his contemporary Honor\u00e9 Daumier, often featured the oppressed and the downtrodden (e.g., The Potato Eaters, 1885) (2) .",

His use of pure color to define content places him ahead of his contemporaries as a forerunner of expressionism. \"I will paint with red and with green the terrible passions of humanity,\" he wrote. \"\u2026Instead of trying to reproduce exactly what I see before my eyes, I use color more arbitrarily to express myself forcibly.\" As if he knew that his artistic career would be very brief, van Gogh painted with a sense of urgency, almost scarring the canvas with thick overlaid brush strokes that were distinct, deliberate, and intense. He wanted \"to exaggerate the essential and to leave the obvious vague\" (3, 2) . His paintings became vehicles of his emotional condition, shifting like his moods from the brightest landscapes (Sunflowers, Irises) to the darkest manifestations of personal symbolism (Starry Night, Wheat Field with Crows).",

There, in the Mediterranean countryside, he painted landscapes of almost pulsating light, as he tried to convey the spiritual meaning he believed animated all things. Exaggerating his figures with vibrant hues, he set them against thick, rough circles like halos, freeing them from static background and hurling them into infinity. Wishing to form an artists' colony in the region, he invited Paul Gauguin to join him \"in this kingdom of light.\" The brief collaboration (less than 2 months) produced many noted works but ended abruptly when van Gogh became violent, attacked his friend with a straight razor, then in remorse cut off his own ear and offered it to a local prostitute.",

While illness largely defined what the artist could and could not do (he only painted when he was lucid), art gave him reason to continue living.
