            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) frequently starts near the lateral ventricles, which are lined by subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitor cells that can migrate to lesions and contribute to repair. Since MS-induced inflammation may decrease SVZ proliferation and thus limit repair, we studied the role of galectin-3 (Gal-3), a pro-inflammatory protein. Gal-3 expression was increased in periventricular regions of human MS in post-mortem brain samples and was also upregulated in periventricular regions in a murine MS model, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection. Whereas TMEV increased SVZ chemokine (CCL2, CCL5, CCL8 and CXCL10) expression in wild type (WT) mice, this was inhibited in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Though numerous CD45+ immune cells entered the SVZ of WT mice after TMEV infection, their numbers were significantly diminished in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. TMEV also reduced neuroblast and proliferative SVZ cell numbers in WT mice but this was restored in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice and was correlated with increased numbers of doublecortin+ neuroblasts in the corpus callosum. In summary, our data showed that loss of Gal-3 blocked chemokine expression, reduced immune cell migration into the SVZ, reestablished SVZ proliferation and increased the number of progenitors in the corpus callosum. These results suggest Gal-3 plays a central role in modulating the SVZ neurogenic niche's response to this model of MS.",

A few therapeutically beneficial drugs decrease inflammation associated with relapsing-remitting MS, but there are no effective treatments for primary or secondary progressive MS. Autologous stem cells may provide neuroprotection and offer a novel yet incompletely validated therapeutic strategy (Connick et al. 2012; Xu et al. 2011; Yamout et al. 2010) . Importantly, exogenous human and rodent subventricular zone (SVZ) progenitor cells decrease inflammation and provide neuroprotection in models of MS and stroke (Jin et al. 2010; Pluchino et al. 2009; Pluchino et al. 2003; Pluchino et al. 2005) . The periventricular white matter surrounding the lateral ventricles and the SVZ stem cell niche is an area of intense inflammation where lesions have lower levels of remyelination than in deep white matter (Dawson 1916; Patrikios et al. 2006) . SVZ progenitors actively migrate to demyelinated regions, differentiate into oligodendrocytes and participate in myelin repair (Jablonska et al. 2010; Menn et al. 2006; Nait-Oumesmar et al. 1999; Nait-Oumesmar et al. 2007; Picard-Riera et al. 2002 ), yet the effects of inflammation on this process is poorly understood.",

The TMEV model provides insights into the mechanisms of progressive MS and allows comparison of susceptible to resistant mouse strains (McCarthy et al. 2012; Mecha et al. 2013a ). In TMEV-IDD, neuronal loss precedes demyelination and expands over time (Tsunoda et al. 2003) . MS is associated with substantial neuronal/axonal loss and this is equally important to oligodendrocyte loss and demyelination (Bo et al. 2006; Bruck 2005; DeLuca et al. 2004) . We showed that the SVZ was targeted early and was the most reproducibly inflamed of all brain regions after TMEV infection (Goings et al. 2008) . Inflammation may dampen endogenous progenitor repair by decreasing proliferation in adult neurogenic niches (Ekdahl et al. 2003; Kokaia et al. 2012; Monje et al. 2003) . Therefore understanding and controlling molecular mechanisms leading to SVZ inflammation may be of benefit when considering the use of endogenous progenitors for therapeutic treatments.",

            "text": "The pro-inflammatory protein, Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is expressed by astrocytes in the healthy SVZ where it regulates neuroblast migration (Comte et al. 2011) . It is also expressed by activated glia during CNS inflammation (Walther et al. 2000; Young et al. 2014 ). Gal-3 is able to regulate inflammation, neurogenesis and migration in multiple systems and could modulate responses to MS (Liu and Rabinovich 2005) . For example, glial cells exposed to recombinant Gal-3 showed induction of proinflammatory molecules (Jeon et al. 2010) . Conversely, loss of Gal-3 decreased both macrophage infiltration and proinflammatory cytokines in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Jiang et al. 2009 ). A recent study showed that cuprizone-induced demyelination was not altered in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice but that remyelination was significantly slower (Hoyos et al. 2014) . Cuprizone causes less inflammation and immune cell infiltration compared to TMEV. Thus, Gal-3's role in demyelination and remyelination seems to depend on the nature of the demyelination. It may also be the case that the cell source of Gal-3 makes a difference -the predominantly activated cell type in cuprizone demyelination is microglia, whereas in this TMEV study astrocytes are implicated. Gal-3 expression is enhanced in active human MS lesions (Stancic et al. 2011 ), but whether Gal-3 is increased in human periventricular regions, corpus callosum or the SVZ in MS was unknown In both human MS and the murine TMEV MS model the adult SVZ shows marked inflammation, which is characterized by florid CD45+ immune cell infiltration (Goings et al. 2008) . We previously showed that TMEV-IDD induced SVZ inflammation occurs early, by 2-3 weeks post infection and before the onset of motor symptoms (Goings et al. 2008) . In this study we have show that Gal-3 acts to enhance SVZ inflammation during the onset of MS like disease in adult mice, via up-regulation of the potent macrophage chemoattractant molecules CCL2, CCL5, CCL8 and CXCL10. We also show that blocking this response in Gal-3 knockout mice is associated with a restoration of SVZ proliferation and numbers of Dcx+ neuroblasts in the SVZ and corpus callosum. Our work identifies Gal-3 as a rational therapeutic target in neuroinflammation through its ability to upregulate macrophage chemoattractant molecule expression in the SVZ.",

Immunohistochemistry was examined and recorded on a Leica DMIRB microscope using Openlab software (Improvision, UK) and on a Zeiss Meta confocal microscope, and analysed in 3-D with Zeiss and Volocity Software (Improvision, UK). Images were composed in Microsoft Powerpoint and Adobe Photoshop. For quantification of CD3+ cells, images of CD3 and DAPI labeled sections were taken at 40x magnification on a Leica DMIRB microscope at 5 viewpoints for SVZ; dorsal-striatal, dorsal-septal, medial-septal, medial-striatal and ventral. For striatum quantification, images were taken at 20x magnification with the SVZ in the left margin of the field of view, and with the SVZ in the right field of view for the septum. Pictures were taken at 20x for the septum as well as the entire length of corpus callosum and azygos pericallosal artery. Images were saved as TIFF files and exported into Volocity software for analysis. The number of CD3+ cells was counted and the corresponding area measured to give a value of number of CD3+ cells/mm 2 . For SVZ regions, DAPI was used to distinguish the SVZ and only cells within the DAPI dense area were included (ependymal cells included). Doublecortin labeled striatal sections were viewed with a 63x objective lens on a Zeiss confocal microscope. With the SVZ to the left margin of the field of view at 63x, Dcx+ cells in the striatum were counted, with the SVZ in the middle of the field showing the full extent of the CC thickness, Dcx+ cells in the CC were counted as in (Goings et al. 2008) . For emigration measurement, cells were only counted if they could be shown to have a DAPI+ nucleus, processes that could not be traced to a cell body were not included. Only cells that had a cell body more than 50 \u03bcm from the SVZ were counted as having 'emigrated'. Images of Dcx+ cells in the dorsolateral SVZ were taken with a 40x objective lens and images counted in Volocity software. For all Dcx quantifications a minimum of 3 sections were counted per mouse including both left and right dlSVZ, N=3-7 for all groups. Images of PHi3 or BrdU and CD45 labeled sections of 4 viewpoints; dorsal-striatal, dorsal-septal, medial-striatal and ventral were taken at 40x on a Zeiss Confocal microscope with a 30 \u03bcm stack taken of each channel that allowed colocalisation to be studied in 3-dimensions. Together these regions covered the entirety of the SVZ. The images were saved and exported as Tiff images into Volocity. The number of PHi3+ or BrdU+ cells that were CD45+ or CD45\u2212 were counted and averaged for 4 consecutive sections per animal ranging from ~Bregma 0.9 to 0.0. The volumes of the stacks were measured to give values of PHi3+cells/mm 3 and PHi3+CD45+ cells/mm 3 . The number of PHi3+cells/mm 3 were then subtracted from PHi3+CD45+ cells/mm 3 to give the number of proliferating neural cells. Only cells that had bright, complete labeling in the nuclei were included, cells that showed fragmented staining were excluded. The PHi3/CD45/DAPI stained sections included a cohort of 6 naive mice in order to account for any changes in proliferation induced by the needle injury. All measurements were taken blind to genotype and treatment to avoid quantification bias.",

Similar to our previous work (Comte et al. 2011 ), Gal-3 was only immunohistochemically detectable in SVZ and ependymal cells of healthy controls but was not apparent in the parenchyma (Fig.  2B) . As in the 129Sv strain (Comte et al. 2011 ), C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice expressed Gal-3 in SVZ astrocytes, ependymal cells, a subset of Mash1+ progenitors but was not found in Dcx+ neuroblasts (data not shown). Gal-3 expression increased in the SVZ at 14 dpi and also became immunodetectable in the dorsal septum and periventricular regions (Fig. 2C) . The same SVZ cells expressed Gal-3 after TMEV infection as in controls. We found many cells that co-expressed Gal-3 and GFAP at 7 dpi ( Fig. 2D-H) . In the striatum 55.3\u00b17.6% of GFAP+ cells were Gal-3+ and in the SVZ the percentage was 60.0\u00b15.8%. Gal-3 was expressed de novo in GFAP+ cells of the striatum after TMEV infection (Fig. 2D-H) . There was no detectable staining of Gal-3 on PECAM+ blood vessel endothelial cells (Fig. 2I -J) although Gal-3 was frequently expressed by perivascular cells surrounding PECAM+ vessels (Fig. 2J) .",

SVZ microglia expressed higher levels of Iba1 and often assumed highly ramified activated microglial morphology after TMEV infection (Fig. 2K,N) . Far more Iba1+ activated microglia/macrophages were found in periventricular regions such as the septum and corpus callosum 7 dpi than in controls (Fig. 1L,M,O,P) . This replicated our previous work showing TMEV-induced inflammation is especially prominent in the SVZ and periventricular regions (Goings et al. 2008) . Activated microglia express Gal-3 following stroke and TBI (Lalancette-Hebert et al. 2012; Venkatesan et al. 2010) . This was of interest since we had shown that SVZ microglia are constitutively semi-activated based on marker expression, morphology and proliferation (Goings et al. 2006 ) even though only a few of them express Gal-3 (Comte et al. 2011 ). We replicated this by showing that Iba1+ SVZ microglia were largely Gal-3 negative in sham controls (Fig. 2Q) . Qualitative examination in this and our previous studies (Comte et al. 2011; Young et al. 2014 ) revealed only 1-3 Iba1+/Gal-3+ SVZ cells per section. We did not find any qualitative changes in this co-expression after TMEV, therefore we did not quantify them (Fig. 2R ). Gal-3 was however, expressed in some highly ramified Iba1+ cells in the corpus callosum after TMEV infection (Fig. 2S-T) . This is similar to our previous results and to published work in active human MS lesions showing Gal-3 expression in macrophages (Stancic et al. 2011 ) and provided validation of the TMEV model for further study.",

Astrocytes were the major SVZ cell type that expressed Gal-3, thus we asked whether direct TMEV infection of these cells would stimulate Gal-3 secretion. A subset of GFAP+ cells expressed Gal-3 in cultured primary astrocytes from the SVZ (55.8\u00b18.5%) and the cerebral cortex (54.4\u00b14.6%) and they secreted low levels of Gal-3 (Suppl. Fig. 2A-I) . Secreted Gal-3 concentrations were dramatically increased after TMEV infection in vitro (Suppl. Fig. 2I ). Gal-3 secretion increases were more substantial from SVZ astrocytes than from cortical astrocytes (Suppl. Fig. 2I ), as expected based on our in vivo ELISA results. We did not carry out MTS assays or caspase-3 staining on the astrocytes in vitro so we can not rule out the possibility that increased Gal-3 was associated with cell death. However, there were no morphological differences between the two cultures or signs of cell death such as blebbing, swelling, or vacuolation. These data indicated that TMEVinfection of astrocytes might stimulate them to release Gal-3 which could influence the local niche.",

We next determined how loss of Gal-3 altered their expression levels in the SVZ and cerebral cortex after TMEV. We first carried out a chemokine/cytokine PCR microarray screen and found that many chemokine and cytokine mRNAs were increased 7 days after TMEV infection (Table 2 and Suppl. Table 2 ). The genes upregulated in the two strains were similar but in general C57BL/6 mice mounted a more robust chemokine response. Only 15 of the 23 genes that showed greater than 4 fold upregulation in C57BL/6 mice were similarly increased in SJL/J mice (Table 2, grey highlighting).

The chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CCL8 and CXCL10 were chosen as they showed the greatest changes at the mRNA level. Chemokine levels were higher in the SVZ than in the cerebral cortex of sham controls of both mouse strains (Fig. 3) . Deletion of Gal-3 in sham controls did not significantly alter chemokine levels in the cerebral cortex of either strain (Fig. 3E -H, M-P). In both C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice, SVZ chemokine levels were significantly lower in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 compared to WT mice after TMEV infection (Fig. 3A -D, I-L), with the exception of CCL2 in C57BL/6 mice, which only had a small non-significant decrease. The greatest difference was seen for CCL5 and CCL8, Gal-3 deletion resulted in a dramatic decrease in their expression after TMEV infection for both C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice (Fig. 3B ,C,J,K). Decreases in cortical CCL5 expression after TMEV were also seen in WT versus Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 3G) . Intriguingly, CCL8 expression levels in the cerebral cortex changed in opposite directions in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 compared to Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 SJL/J mice (Fig.   3F,N) . These chemokine differences in the SVZ suggested that the extent of immune cell infiltration into the SVZ after TMEV infection would be altered in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Representative dot plots of forward (FSC) and side scatter (SSC) profiles and singlet populations (Suppl. Fig. 3B ,C) were consistent with a population of predominantly mononuclear cells, which are 86% positive for the macrophage marker F4/80 (Suppl. Fig. 3D ). CCL5 showed clear evidence of directed macrophage migration over a 4-hour period as compared to vehicle alone (Suppl. Fig. 3E ). Suppl. Fig. 3F ,G show analysis of pooled chemotaxis data (n>3) for CCL2 and CCL5. Slope and max-min measure initial rate of migration and magnitude of response, respectively. Altered migration compared to vehicle was not observed in response to CXCL10 or CCL8 (data not shown). In order to assess whether recombinant Gal-3 can act as a chemoattractant for murine macrophages we tested the ability of Gal-3 to mediate directed migration at concentrations up to 300 nM. In contrast to the reported effects of recombinant human Gal-3 on human monocytes/macrophages in modified Boyden Chamber assays (Sano et al. 2000) we observed no directed migration of murine macrophages to Gal-3 (Suppl. Fig. 3E ). The recombinant Gal-3 used was shown to have biological activity in a separate neurosphere adhesion assay (Suppl. Fig. 3H ).",

We found many amoeboid CD45+ cells in the dorsal SVZ, ventral SVZ, striatum and septum at 3, 7, and 14 dpi (Fig. 4A) . In Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 SJL/J mice, significantly fewer amoeboid CD45+ cells were found in all four regions at 7 dpi, the time of maximum inflammation in WT mice (Fig. 4B) . Similarly, Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice had significantly fewer amoeboid CD45+ cells in these regions compared to WT C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 4C) . In contrast to SJL/J's, this inhibition was apparent at 3 and 14 dpi but not at 7 dpi (Fig. 4C) . Thus, loss of Gal-3 inhibited the increase in immune cell numbers in both the TMEV-resistant and the TMEVsusceptible strain although the timing differed.",

CD3+ cells (of any morphology) were not observed in forebrain sections in healthy mice (Suppl. Fig. 4C ) however TMEV caused a high concentration of CD3+ cells to appear in the SVZ (Suppl. Fig. 4) . These were frequently in the vicinity of periventricular blood vessels, and at the junction between the septum and the corpus callosum (Suppl. Fig. 4A ). Many of the infiltrating CD3+ cells were associated with the midline azygous pericallosal artery (Suppl. Fig. 4B ). CD3+ cells also appeared in the periventricular septum and striatum 7 dpi but were found in lower densities than in the SVZ (Suppl. Fig. 4C ). Numbers of CD3+ cells in the SVZ of SJL/J mice increased through 14 dpi (Suppl. Fig. 4D ). In TMEV resistant C57BL/6 mice, the maximum density of CD3+ cells in the SVZ peaked at 7 dpi and there was a large reduction by 14 dpi (Suppl. Fig. 3E ). About half of CD3+ cells (40-60%) expressed Gal-3 at 7 and 14 dpi in the forebrain regions examined (Suppl. Fig. 3F ). These results show that CD3+ (T cells) infiltrate the SVZ soon after TMEV infection and contribute to the inflammatory response. They also suggest that C57BL/6 T cell infiltration is more transitory compared to SJL/J's.",

However, the Iba1+ cell activation and presence of high numbers of CD3+ T cells in the first two weeks after TMEV suggested neural proliferation in the SVZ might be decreased. We excluded hematopoietic lineage cells from this analysis by counting PHi3+/CD45\u2212 cells. Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 129Sv mice did not have altered basal levels of proliferation (Comte et al. 2011) and in these studies we found the same result in sham SJL/J and C57BL/6 mice, both with PHi3+/CD45\u2212 and BrdU+/CD45\u2212 cell counts (Fig. 5B-E) .",

We had previously observed that at 24 dpi and later time points, the tight chains of Dcx+ SVZ neuroblasts were disrupted in TMEV infected mice (Goings et al. 2008 ). Here we found a qualitatively similar effect at 3 through 14 dpi (Fig. 5F-G) . The total number of Dcx+ cells in the SVZ was decreased significantly after TMEV in C57BL/6 WT mice but this was not altered in C57BL/6 Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig.   5H ). In contrast, the loss of Gal-3 significantly increased the number of SVZ neuroblasts in SJL/J's (Fig. 5I) . We were concerned that the changes in the number of Dcx+ cells in the SVZ could be due to precocious differentiation or excessive cell death in the SVZ. We therefore carried out neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and Caspase-3 immunohistochemistry to detect mature neurons and apoptotic cells, respectively. We did not detect NeuN+ cells in the SVZ in either shams or at 7 dpi (SJL/J's) (Fig. 5J-K) . Additionally, we found very few Caspase-3+ cells in the SVZ and there was no difference in the number of Caspase-3+ cells between shams and 7 dpi (Fig. 5L-M) .",

Since we showed that loss of Gal-3 can restore SVZ proliferation, we asked if this was associated with increased numbers of Dcx+ cells in the corpus callosum (white matter) or striatum (grey matter) (Fig. 6A ). The number of Dcx+ cells found in the corpus callosum was increased in C57BL/6 Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice at 3, 7 and 14 dpi (Fig. 6B-C) . The large majority of these cells had a distinctive bipolar migratory morphology, with leading processes and trailing edges (Fig. 6B-C) (Martinez-Molina et al. 2011; Nam et al. 2007 ). Increased numbers of Dcx+ cells were found in the striatum after TMEV, but interestingly this effect was blocked in C57BL/6 Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 6D-F) . The data suggest that loss of Gal-3 redirected SVZ emigration from the grey matter (striatum) to the white matter (corpus callosum) in C57BL/6 mice. Similar to C57BL/6 Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, SJL/J Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice had increased numbers of Dcx+ cells in the corpus callosum, the differences being significant at 7 and 14 days after TMEV (Fig. 6G ). Unlike the C57BL/6 Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice, SJL/J Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 did not exhibit significantly different numbers of Dcx+ cells in the striatum after TMEV (Fig. 6G) .

CCL2, CCL5, CCL8 and CXCL10 chemokine expression in the SVZ was dramatically augmented after TMEV infection, but this was inhibited in Gal-3 knockout mice. TMEV infection induced the appearance of large numbers of immune cells in the SVZ but this was also blocked in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. We hypothesize that this was due to the lack of chemokine expression increases since we showed that CCL2 and CCL5 are chemoattractants to macrophages.

In that work, we found increased numbers of CD45+ cells in the SVZ at 14 dpi but were uncertain which immune cells were activated and how soon this occurred (Goings et al. 2008) . Here, CD3+ T cells were found in the SVZ and periventricular regions already 3 dpi and peaked around 7 dpi. Many Iba1+ microglia and macrophages were also found in and around the SVZ after TMEV and overlapped with peak T cell infiltration. Both strains showed a peak of SVZ inflammation at 7 dpi but it resolved more quickly in C57BL/6 mice, which may contribute to this strain's TMEV-resistance. Interestingly, Gal-3 was expressed at higher levels in healthy SJL/J's than in C57BL/6's but it was increased more dramatically after TMEV infection in C57BL/6's. The temporal and spatial pattern of TMEV-induced immune cell activation in mice resembled that of increased Gal-3 expression, and was similar to what was seen in human MS sections. Thus the lateral ventricle region seems to be targeted both in human MS and TMEV infection can model rapid SVZ inflammation.",

Our Goings et al. 2008 study indicated that the SVZ seemed to be preferentially targeted by the BeAn TMEV virus and immunohistochemistry showed good overlap between the virus and SVZ neuroblasts. In this study we have infected a culture of astrocytes and showed increased Gal-3 release. The majority of cells in the astrocyte cultures were indeed astrocytes, the large majority of DAPI+ nuclei were in GFAP+ cells. Nevertheless it is difficult to completely remove microglia from these cultures and we cannot exclude that some of the effects were due to microglial contaminants. Although it is clear that Gal-3 expression increased after TMEV infection, the exact cell source and signaling pathways involved were not examined. A particularly interesting feature of this study and our previous work was that both Gal-3 and chemokines were expressed at higher levels in the SVZ and periventricular regions, both constitutively and after TMEV injections. Gal-3 is selectively expressed in the SVZ in healthy animals (Comte et al. 2011 ) and immunohistochemistry showed that Gal-3 was increased in the SVZ after TMEV injections. Furthermore ELISAs on dissected SVZ tissue showed large increases in chemokines after TMEV injections. These chemokine increases were blocked in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice suggesting that Gal-3 mediates their expression. Gal-3 could act intra-or extracellularly in the SVZ to regulate chemokine expression, however we do not know which scenario predominated in this study.",

We showed that chemokines were expressed at higher levels in the SVZ than in the cerebral cortex of healthy controls and that their expression increased markedly after TMEV. We hypothesize that immune cells migrate into the SVZ much earlier and more robustly than into nearby regions due to its relatively larger chemokine increases. Loss of Gal-3 inhibited CCL2, CCL5, CCL8 and CXCL10 upregulation in TMEV infected mice. Since all four chemokines are chemoattractant to T cells in the CNS (Huang et al. 2001; Karpus et al. 1995; Muzio et al. 2010; Tsunoda et al. 2004) , it is likely they contributed to the diminished immune cell infiltration in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. We also provided direct evidence that CCL2 and CCL5 were chemoattractants to mouse macrophages in an vitro assay and thus believe these two chemokines specifically influenced macrophage migration into the SVZ in vivo. CCL2 was previously shown to be highly up-regulated by microglia and astrocytes after TMEV and anti-CCL2 treatment reduced numbers of CNS-infiltrating T-cells and macrophages (Banisadr et al. 2011; Belmadani et al. 2006; Karpus et al. 2006) . In our study we showed that both T cells and macrophage cell numbers are dramatically increased in the SVZ after TMEV infections.

They are likely to have multiple distinct effects in this model and interestingly, there were differences in how TMEV induced them in C57BL/6 versus SJL/J mice. It is possible that the greater increase in Gal-3 expression in the resistant strain induced expression of molecules that helped clear the disease. Gal-3 itself has been proposed as a chemoattractant to macrophages (Sano et al. 2000) , however we did not reproduce this result in vitro and SJL/J's contained far more T cells in the SVZ after TMEV than C57BL/ 6's, despite their more modest Gal-3 increase. Data from both strains indicated that the SVZ seems to be a hot-spot of infiltration in TMEV and that Gal-3 regulated chemokine expression (Papaspyridonos et al. 2008 ).",

We showed that TMEV infection decreased the number of Phi3+ and BrdU+ CD45negative neural lineage cells as well as the number of Dcx+ SVZ neuroblasts. Gal-3 loss did not impact homeostatic SVZ proliferation in 129Sv mice (Comte et al. 2011 ), a result replicated here in SJL/J and C57BL/6 shams. This suggests that the decreased proliferation after TMEV was probably not caused by increased Gal-3 but may have been influenced by either the changes in chemokine levels and/or the infiltration of immune cells. The reduced proliferation in C57BL/6 Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice at 7 dpi followed the earlier reduction in amoeboid CD45+ cells at 3 dpi. SJL/J Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice had reduced amoeboid CD45+ cell numbers at 7 dpi and more normal levels of SVZ proliferation at 14 dpi. The results suggest reduced SVZ immune cell infiltration in Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 mice allowed maintenance of more normal proliferation levels.",

Since Dcx is expressed by newborn migratory SVZ neuroblasts, the simplest explanation is that they migrated from the neurogenic niche and the cells had distinctive migratory morphology. However, Dcx is expressed in some non-neurogenic regions (Luzzati et al. 2008 ) and TMEV may have induced aberrant Dcx expression. Since SVZ progenitors have been found to be neuroprotective, the increased emigration may contribute to neuroprotection. This will ultimately have to be tested in long-term studies that determine cellular and behavioural correlates of increased SVZ progenitor emigration to the corpus callosum. In particular it will be important to show if they are neuroprotective, survive and contribute remyelinating cells.",

We demonstrated before that Gal-3 was necessary for rostral migration in the SVZ; Gal-3 \u2212/\u2212 had slower and more local exploratory cell migration patterns (Comte et al. 2011 ) and local migration may have contributed to the greater rates of emigration after TMEV. We do not know if the decreased rostral migration of SVZ neuroblasts we showed in (Comte et al. 2011 ) is associated with decreased olfactory functions. However, human MS has been associated with reduced olfaction and we found that demyelinating human pathologies, including MS, involve olfactory bulb and tract demyelination (DeLuca et al. 2014) .",

            "text": "Overall this study provides evidence that Gal-3 has pivotal functions in TMEV-induced chemokine expression, T cell infiltration, SVZ progenitor proliferation and neuroblast numbers. This is important because SVZ progenitor cells can be neuroprotective in several types of injury (Jin et al. 2010; Pluchino et al. 2003; Pluchino et al. 2005 ) and because white matter surrounding the SVZ frequently has demyelinated lesions in human MS (Dawson 1916) . Gal-3 periventricular distribution was unknown and we showed that it increased in all MS cases examined and corresponded with the location of astrocytosis and microgliosis in active periventricular lesions. Gal-3 is constitutively produced by astrocytes and ependymal cells in the SVZ (Comte et al. 2011) and in this study striatal and septal astrocytes began to express Gal-3 after TMEV infection. As well, direct infection of cultured astrocytes with TMEV stimulated the secretion of high levels of Gal-3. Taken together our work suggests that the SVZ, a source of reparative endogenous progenitors is specifically targeted by TMEV, which may limit its beneficial role. It also suggests that Gal-3 regulates this process and since it is druggable, may in the future provide a therapeutic target for treating MS.",
