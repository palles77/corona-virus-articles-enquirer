In 1986, President Ronald Reagan proclaimed the third week in October as ''Infection Control Week'' (now known as International Infection Prevention Week) as a way to focus attention on the importance of infection prevention in the United States and the global community and to honor the work of infection preventionists (IPs).",

            "text": "In the midst of the busy, sometimes frenetic pace of work in contemporary health care, we pause to ask several questions: What does this week mean for the specialty of IPC? What does this week mean for the future of infection prevention and patient safety in emerging health care systems? How will infection prevention professionals and organizations participate in shaping future health care systems? 3 Historically, IPC has provided a systematic, unbiased method for identifying infections and infectious risks for patients and health care workers. In 1986, the year of the first ''Infection Control Week,'' most acute care occurred in hospitals, and although hospital IPC programs included ''prevention'' as a function of the program, the emphasis was on surveillance, with most of the program resources devoted to this area. During the 1980s, most health care involving invasive procedures or devices was provided in acute care facilities, HAI rates were not shared with persons or agencies outside of the hospital, and in most cases IPC was performed by designated ICPs, not multidisciplinary teams. At that time, bioterrorism belonged in science fiction, AIDS was an ''emerging disease,'' methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus was starting to migrate from academic tertiary care centers to mainstream community hospitals, and health care workers practiced using information from specialized disciplines. 4 Health care was evolving from a reliance on structures and processes that were more appropriate for organizations with predictable, discreet knowledge areas to the use of processes for complex adaptive system in which services and departments built on separate and unique knowledge areas were integrated and interactive. This newer environment was also one in which performance improvement was mandated and cost reductions were expected. 5 In 2009, complex, invasive health care procedures and technologies are not limited to acute care facilities, but occur in a variety of settings, including long-term care, ambulatory care, and patient homes. There are also discussions about providing some types of postoperative care at hotels located near surgery centers. IPs are challenged to institute IPC programs in these new practice settings but often lack a sufficient evidence editorial base to support their recommendations. In many nonacute care settings, infection criteria are not established, infections are not investigated, antibiotics are prescribed empirically, and denominators are not standardized. In addition, IPC staff are expected to provide strategies to control emerging biological challenges, such as multidrug-resistant organisms, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and such infections as pandemic influenza. IPs are key leaders in the application of intervention bundles that when instituted with other multidisciplinary health care workers, synergistically produce unexpected and welcome improvements in outcomes for patients with a central vascular line or on a ventilator. Furthermore, today there is a growing awareness that although health care involves complex, sophisticated, highly technical processes and devices, the basics still count, and isolated independent actions can impact other processes and parts within health care systems. There is an appreciation of the fact that successful outcomes require synergy among elements of care, including the mechanical-physical, psychological, social, emotional, and spiritual aspects.",
