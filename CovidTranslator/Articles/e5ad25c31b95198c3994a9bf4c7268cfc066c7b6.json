            "text": "Urtica dioica agglutinin (UDA) is a small plant monomeric lectin, 8.7 kDa in size, with an Nacetylglucosamine specificity that inhibits viruses from Nidovirales in vitro. In the current study, we first examined the efficacy of UDA on the replication of different SARS-CoV strains in Vero 76 cells. UDA inhibited virus replication in a dose-dependent manner and reduced virus yields of the Urbani strain by 90% at 1.1 \u00b1 0.4 g/ml in Vero 76 cells. Then, UDA was tested for efficacy in a lethal SARS-CoV-infected BALB/c mouse model. BALB/c mice were infected with two LD 50 (575 PFU) of virus for 4 h before the mice were treated intraperitoneally with UDA at 20, 10, 5 or 0 mg/kg/day for 4 days. Treatment with UDA at 5 mg/kg significantly protected the mice against a lethal infection with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (p < 0.001), but did not significantly reduce virus lung titers. All virus-infected mice receiving UDA treatments were also significantly protected against weight loss (p < 0.001). UDA also effectively reduced lung pathology scores. At day 6 after virus exposure, all groups of mice receiving UDA had much lower lung weights than did the placebo-treated mice. Thus, our data suggest that UDA treatment of SARS infection in mice leads to a substantial therapeutic effect that protects mice against death and weight loss. Furthermore, the mode of action of UDA in vitro was further investigated using live SARS-CoV Urbani strain virus and retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike (S). UDA specifically inhibited the replication of live SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus when added just before, but not after, adsorption. These data suggested that UDA likely inhibits SARS-CoV infection by targeting early stages of the replication cycle, namely, adsorption or penetration. In addition, we demonstrated that UDA neutralizes the virus infectivity, presumably by binding to the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein. Finally, the target molecule for the inhibition of virus replication was partially characterized. When UDA was exposed to N-acetylglucosamine and then UDA was added to cells just prior to adsorption, UDA did not inhibit the virus infection. These data support the conclusion that UDA might bind to N-acetylglucosamine-like residues present on the glycosylated envelope glycoproteins, thereby preventing virus attachment to cells. (D.L. Barnard). ized by high mortality and morbidity in infected individuals. By July 31, 2003, more than 8000 SARS cases and nearly 800 SARS-related deaths were reported around the world. Studies on the molecular evolution of SARS-CoV suggest that the virus emerged from non-human sources (Guan et al., 2003) . The civet cat coronavirus was shown to have a sequence identity of more than 99% to the SARS-CoV with only a limited number of deletions and mutations between both viruses. SARS-CoV was shown to have a deletion of 29 nucleotides relative to the civet cat virus, possibly suggesting that there was direct transmission from civet to humans (Guan et al., 2003) . Virus transmission to humans may have occurred when civet 0166-3542/$ -see front matter",

Ribavirin in combination with corticosteroids was the most frequently administered antiviral agent during the SARS outbreak (Booth et al., 2003; Ho et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003a; Tsang et al., 2003; Tsui et al., 2003) . However, ribavirin alone at nontoxic concentrations was found to have little in vitro activity against SARS-CoV , although an improved clinical outcome was reported among SARS patients receiving early administration of Kaletra plus ribavirin and corticosteroids (Tsang and Seto, 2004) . At present, no clear evidence has been provided to support these clinical observations yet ). In several mouse models and in vitro, ribavirin was even found to enhance the SARS-CoV infection (Barnard et al., 2006a,b; Day et al., 2009) . Therefore, development of new anti-SARS-CoV agents is urgently needed should SARS-CoV, or a virus closely related to it, emerge or re-emerge to cause disease.",

Additionally, the main protease of SARS, which is essential for the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, has been a key target for developing anti-SARS drugs Barnard and Kumaki, 2009; Yang et al., 2003) . Antisense RNA and RNA interference (RNAi) technologies have shown potential in treating some severe diseases including SARS-CoV infection (Leonard and Schaffer, 2006) . Interferons have also been considered as the first line of defense against viral infections. In earlier studies, we evaluated a few compounds approved for therapeutic use in humans and some in vitro inhibitors of SARS-CoV for inhibition in the mouse SARS-CoV replication model. A hybrid interferon, interferon alpha (IFN-\u2423) B/D, and a mismatched double-stranded (ds) RNA interferon inducer, Ampligen (poly I:poly C124), were shown to potently inhibit virus titers in the lungs of infected mice (Barnard et al., 2006a) .

We previously adapted and characterized a new strain of SARS-CoV (strain v2163) that was highly lethal in 5-6-week-old BALB/c mice (Day et al., 2009) . A number of compounds were tested for efficacy in SARS-CoVinfected BALB/c mice, including UDA. We earlier reported that UDA was partially protective in SARS-CoV-infected mice (Day et al., 2009) . UDA at 5 mg/kg/day was shown to significantly delay the mean day of death compared to the average onset of death for animals receiving physiological sterile saline (PSS) (6.2 \u00b1 1.7 days, p < 0.01). However, only 50% of the UDA-treated animals survived. Nevertheless, visual lung scores for both day 3 and day 6 for all lectin treatments in that experiment were lower than those observed in the lungs of placebo-treated mice. In addition, weight reduction changes from day 0 to day 4 (difference between day 0 and day 4 weights) were also less for lectin-treated animals than for PSStreated mice. These data suggest that UDA treatment of mice did ameliorate the lethality and some of the associated lung pathogenesis in mice infected with the mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Furthermore, a higher concentration of UDA was tested to determine its efficacy in reducing lethality and ameliorating the pathogenesis in mice infected with a lethal dose of mouse-adapted SARS-CoV. Our data showed that increasing the concentration of UDA treatment to 15 mg/kg/day did not increase the efficacy of UDA compared to UDA used at 5 mg/kg/day. Because of the positive results obtained from in vitro assays and the initial studies showing the efficacy of UDA treatment in significantly reducing mortality in the lethal SARS-CoV mouse model, UDA was further evaluated in the lethal mouse model for SARS-CoV to see if efficacy could be improved. We optimized the dosage regimen to increase the effectiveness of UDA against SARS-CoV in BALB/c mouse model in terms of survival. We also further investigated the mode of action of UDA in vitro.",

At this dose, mice were significantly protected against weight loss by day 6 (Table 2, p < 0.05) and thereafter, all mice were protected against death due to virus infection (p < 0.001, Fig. 2 ). Further analysis of death revealed that this same dose of UDA significantly enhanced the ratio of live mice to total mice in the treatment group (p < 0.01) and obviously increased the mean day of death (p < 0.05, Table 3 ). Interestingly, the 10 mg/kg/day dose of UDA also afforded significant protection against death when evaluating all parameters of death, and also protected against weight loss ( Fig. 2 and Tables 2 and 3 ). In contrast, the higher dose of 20 mg/kg/day was not nearly as protective against death, was slightly toxic in uninfected mice at day 2 and day 3 after treatment ( Fig. 1) , and did not ameliorate weight loss in infected, treated mice during the critical days of infection (days 3-9) ( Table 2 and Fig. 2) . However, this dose still prolonged the survival of mice as evidenced by the fact that the median day of death (the calculated day on which most mice died) was 16 days. In addition, even when mice treated with UDA at 20 mg/kg/day, they were almost 3-times less likely to die as rapidly as mice treated with placebo (see hazard ratio, Table 3 ). This suggests that the 10 mg/kg/day dose of UDA might be the maximum tolerated efficacious dose.",

Marked inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV replication were observed when the treatment occurred just before virus exposure to cells, but the inhibition was three times less when the treatment occurred after adsorption (Table 6 ). This effect was even more pronounced when comparing IC 90 values in virus yield reduction assay, pretreating cells with UDA resulted in an IC 50 of 0.05 g/ml. We also tested whether UDA would affect SARS-CoV replication 24 h after infection. Treatment with UDA 24 h after infection did not inhibit SARS-CoV replication. In order to examine the possibility that the inhibitory effect was due to direct binding of UDA to SARS-CoV, UDA was added to the virus for 1 h before inoculation. Marked inhibition of SARS-CoV replication was observed comparable to UDA pre-treatment of cells, suggesting UDA might react directly with SARS-CoV (Table 6) .",

We have also shown that UDA inhibited retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV spike (S) infection in vitro, suggesting that a function of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein might be targeted by UDA. This in vitro inhibitory activity also translated into inhibition of virus-induced mortality in a lethal SARS-CoV challenge model of mice, but did not reduce the virus lung titers. One possibility to explain the efficacy of UDA in spite of not significantly reducing virus titers may be attributed to the putative mechanism of action supported by the data previously described. It is likely that UDA inhibits attachment and thus limits spread of virus from infected cells to uninfected cells by binding to released virus to prevent attachment to uninfected cells. Since in the current study entire lungs were harvested, homogenized, and titrated for virus, there would be no way of differentiating intracellular infectious virus from virus released from infected cells. If bronchial fluids from lung lavages had been assayed for virus, there may have well been a decrease in titers of released extracellular virus in response to UDA treatment, especially at day 3 and day 4 when maximal virus titers from lung homogenates are achieved.",

Similar findings have also been reported (Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . Yen et al. (2006) showed that human monocytic THP-1 cell line was susceptible to SARS-CoV. In that study, SARS-CoV induced THP-1 cells to express MCP-1, IL-8, MIP-1\u2423, IP-10, MIP-1\u2424, and RANTES. Li et al. (2005a) reported that RANTES inhibited SARS-CoV replication in THP-1 cells when added into the culture at the same time with the SARS-CoV or before, but not after, infection. In this report, significantly high levels of mouse RANTES in the lungs of BALB/c mice were detected when SARS-CoV-infected mice were treated with UDA or poly IC:LC, indicating that elevated RANTES inhibits the disease progression. In addition, IL-1\u2424, IL-6 and MCP-1 were more strongly expressed in SARS-CoV-infected mice. IL-6 and MCP-1 have also been observed in human SARS patients (Chen and Subbarao, 2007) . Jiang et al. (2005) demonstrated that superinfection after immune injury and acute respiratory distress as well as lung failure are the main causes of death. The rapid increase of IL-6, IL-8 and MCP-1 is a sign of superinfection, indicating a high risk of death. Conversely, we observed that detectable levels of IL-1\u2424, IL-6, MCP-1 and MIP-1\u2423 dropped when BALB/c mice were treated with UDA or poly IC:LC.

Plant lectins are sugarbinding proteins with high affinity for their specific sugar residues and play important roles in biological recognition phenomena involving cells and proteins. Some viruses use lectins to attach themselves to the host cells to initiate infection (Jeffers et al., 2004) . SARS-CoV antigens have been detected in alveolar epithelial cells (primarily type II pneumocytes), bronchial epithelial cells, and alveolar macrophages of the respiratory tract (Ding et al., 2004; Ye et al., 2007) . All of these cell types have ACE2 . CD209L is expressed in human lung on type II alveolar cells and can mediate infection by SARS-CoV (Jeffers et al., 2004) . SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein attaches to use both ACE2 and CD209L in the early steps of viral infection. Because previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the cell surface lectins DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR (Marzi et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2004) , it needs to be further determined whether UDA blocks binding of SARS-CoV to DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR.

Therefore, they are attractive therapeutic targets for novel antiviral therapies. When van der Meer et al. (2007) used an immunoperoxidase staining assay and a luciferase-based assay to evaluate the antiviral activity of UDA, they showed that UDA inhibited Nidovirales in vitro. These assays are based on the number of infected cells and expression of viral proteins. UDA binds to the viral glycoproteins to inhibit virus entry into the target cells (Balzarini, 2007) . O 'Keefe et al. (2010) recently reported that a potent antiviral lectin griffithsin (GRST), a 12.7 kDa protein originally isolated from red alga Griffithsia sp., inhibited SARS-CoV infection both in vitro and in vivo. GRST is known to bind not only to N-acetylglucosamine, but also to mannose in a multivalent manner via its three independent carbohydrate-binding domains (Ziolkowska et al., 2006) . GRST specifically bound to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein to inhibit viral entry likely because SARS-CoV spike protein is heavily glycosylated and contains 23 putative N-glycosylation sites (Krokhin et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . We also confirmed that the inhibitory effects of SARS-CoV infection were observed when UDA was added to the live SARS-CoV Urbani strain or SARS-CoV pseudotyped virus for 1 h before inoculation, suggesting UDA might react directly with SARS-CoV. Based on these observations, we further examined whether UDA would affect the binding site to cell-surface sugar chains in Vero 76 or 293T-ACE2 cells. UDA had been removed after 1 h treatment and both cells had been washed with the medium before infection. No reduction in viral CPE was observed. Our data suggest that UDA did not affect the binding site to cell-surface sugar chains at all. Furthermore, we demonstrated that UDA neutralized the virus infectivity, presumably by binding to the SARS-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein.",

Nevertheless, the data support our conclusion that UDA likely binds to the S protein via N-acetylglucosamine residues of the SARS-CoV S protein to inhibit attachment to cells, thereby preventing virus infection of cells.",

            "text": "Although the in vitro data suggest that one mode of inhibition might be the binding of UDA to the virion to prevent adsorption, another possibility that needs to be further investigated is whether UDA might protect mice from virus challenge by regulating immune responses in addition to or in lieu of inhibition of SARS-CoV directly. For example, it has been found that UDA might function as a superantigenic lectin in activating T-cell responses and cytokine production (Galelli and Truffa-Bachi, 1993) . The mechanism of immune modulation is also supported by the significant increase in RANTES levels in infected mice receiving UDA treatment compared to RANTES levels detected in un-treated, infected mice. Given the demonstrated in vitro and in vivo inhibition of SARS-CoV replication, UDA or an analog might qualify as a potential therapy for treating SARS-CoV infections.",
