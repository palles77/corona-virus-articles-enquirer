Universal vaccines targeting conserved viral components might provide cross-protection and thus complement and improve conventional vaccines. In this study, we generated DNA plasmids and recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the conserved proteins nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase basic 1 (PB1), and matrix 1 (M1) from influenza virus strain A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2). BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly with a single vaccine based on NP, PB1, or M1 alone or a combination vaccine based on all three antigens and were then challenged with lethal doses of the heterologous influenza virus strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1). Vaccines based on NP, PB1, and M1 provided complete or partial protection against challenge with 1.7 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of PR8 in mice. Of the three antigens, NP-based vaccines induced protection against 5 LD 50 and 10 LD 50 and thus exhibited the greatest protective effect. Universal influenza vaccines based on the combination of NP, PB1, and M1 induced a strong immune response and thus might be an alternative approach to addressing future influenza virus pandemics.

However, HA-and NA-based conventional influenza vaccines sometimes fail to prevent flu epidemics because the HA and/or NA in the vaccine strains is a mismatch with that in circulating virus strains (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . Universal influenza vaccines (UIVs) that induce effective and long-term cross-protection and address the risk of mismatch may overcome the shortcomings of conventional influenza vaccines.

            "text": "Influenza viruses are classified as type A, B, or C based on their nucleoprotein (NP) and matrix protein (M). Among the three subtypes, influenza A virus has been the target of UIVs, because the diverse influenza A strains frequently trigger influenza epidemics and pandemics. A previous study indicated that humans mount a good response to the highly conserved internal proteins NP, M1, and polymerase basic 1 (PB1) of influenza A virus (9) ; therefore, these highly conserved influenza A virus antigens are the basis of UIVs. Multiple studies have investigated the potential of NP (10) (11) (12) (13) , matrix protein 1 (M1) (14) (15) (16) (17) , and ion channel (M2, mainly M2e) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) (27) as alternative vaccine antigens for the prevention of seasonal and pandemic flu outbreaks. PB1 has also shown protective potential but requires further investigation for inclusion in UIVs. Ko\u0161\u00edk et al. (28) constructed a DNA vaccine based on PB1, which provided some protective immunity in a mouse model. We previously constructed DNA vaccines based on PB1 and PB2 from influenza virus strains A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) (PR8) and A/Beijing/30/95 (H3N2) (BJ95). Mice immunized with DNA vaccines based on PB1 from PR8 or BJ95 were protected against sublethal PR8 challenge, whereas mice immunized with PB2-based DNA vaccines were not. These data suggest that the influenza viral structural protein PB1 shows promise for inclusion in a DNA vaccine against the influenza A virus (29) . Recent studies suggested that the injection of vaccines based on NP, M1, M2, or PB1 conferred protection in mice challenged with a lethal virus dose. In many cases, UIVs were developed by combining several antigens or epitopes to induce a comprehensive immune response. For example, NP was often used in combination with M1 or M2e to provide protection superior to that conferred by either antigen alone (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) (36) (37) (38) (39) (40) (41) (42) (43) . In addition, UIVs containing influenza virus HA, M1, and/or NP provided effective cross-protection against a lethal challenge of influenza virus (38, (44) (45) (46) (47) . Jeon, Ben-Yedidia, and Arnon (48) fused the oligonucleotides coding for three epitopes, HA 91-108 (B-cell epitope), NP [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] (Th-cell  epitope) , and NP 147-158 (CD8 \u03e9 T-cell epitope), of influenza virus in tandem with the flagellin protein of Salmonella. Mucosal immunization with the fusion vaccine protected BALB/c mice against influenza virus of a different subtype. Therefore, UIVs based on multiple components can induce a strong immune re-sponse and might represent an alternative approach to preventing future influenza virus pandemics.",

In some cases, alternate prime-boost strategies were used to develop combination vaccines for stable and long-term protection. For example, Lo et al. (30) constructed NP-based DNA and adenovirus vaccines and showed that a DNA prime-adenovirus boost strategy greatly improved the cross-protection induced by NP-based vaccines. Luo et al. (49) found that the immune response induced in mice by the NP DNA vaccine was enhanced by an intranasal boost with recombinant NP (rNP) protein. The prime-boost strategy provided protection not only against the homologous virus but also cross-protection against a heterosubtypic H9N2 strain. A UIV based on a fusion of NP and M1 was constructed in recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and adenovirus (Ad), and various immunization regimens were assessed. The alternate Ad prime-MVA boost vaccination regimen induced the strongest immune responses in BALB/c mice and chickens and therefore was the most immunogenic regime (38, 41) .",

Vaccinia virus Tiantan is a characteristic strain with a wide host range, powerful multiplication capacity, abundant regions containing unnecessary genes, a high capacity for foreign gene insertion, noncarcinogenicity, lasting immunity, and cytoplasmic replication, and a long history of applications in humans. It has been used widely as a recombinant vaccine vector for many years, and multiple recombinant vaccinia viruses based on the Tiantan strain have been reported (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) .

However, no obvious IgG response was induced by the PB1-based vac- cine, regardless of whether it was applied alone or in the primeboost immunization strategy (data not shown). In addition, rVV-M1 immunization induced a marked ELISA IgG response compared with that of the control group (P \u03fd 0.01), whereas pSCA-M1 immunization did not. Meanwhile, pSCA-M1 prime-rVV-M1 boost immunization induced a slightly, but not significantly, higher ELISA IgG titer than that of rVV-M1 alone (P \u03fe 0.05; Fig. 3A ). When NP-, PB1-, and M1-based vaccines were applied in a combination immunization, DNA and rVV vaccines induced obvious humoral immune responses, and the combined rVV vaccines induced a significantly higher IgG titer than did the combined DNA vaccines.

In summary, only the DNA prime-rVV boost strategy based on NP or a combination of antigens protected against challenge with 10 LD 50 of PR8. (Table 1) at the times indicated in Fig. 3 . Mice were challenged with 1.7 LD 50 of influenza virus PR8 at week 8 and were monitored daily for 17 days after challenge (n \u03ed 10 mice/group). The mice were weighed daily to detect morbidity (left graphs). The mean weights in each treatment group were followed for the duration of the study, and the percentage of the original body weight was calculated based on the mean weight of each group at day 0.

            "text": "Another possible reason for the greater efficacy of the NP antigen is interference by the vector. The combination vaccines were applied using a dose of vector 3-fold higher than that for the single vaccine; therefore, adverse effects resulting from the increased concentration of vector cannot be ruled out. Such effects might have diminished the immune response to the antigens. This could be overcome by maintaining the target antigen dose while decreasing that of the vector. In addition, interference among vectors could be decreased by developing vector-based vaccines using fusion antigens. Several combination vaccines that yielded less interference have been generated. For example, Donnelly et al. (63) constructed a DNA vaccine by fusing influenza virus HA, M1, and NP genes. In contrast, Jeon, Ben-Yedidia, and Arnon (48) fused the HA 91-108 (B-cell epitope), NP 55-69 (Th-cell epitope), and NP 147-158 (CD8 \u03e9 T-cell epitope) influenza virus epitopes with Salmonella flagellin. Zhou et al. (32) constructed adenovirus-based vaccines by fusing M2e and NP. In addition, the MVA-based universal influenza vaccine MVA-NP\u03e9M1, which has been tested in human phase 1 clinical trials, contains a fusion of NP to M1 (39) . Finally, an rVV-based vaccine that contains multiple T epitopes of the M1, nonstructural 1 (NS1), NP, PB1, and polymerase acidic (PA) influenza virus proteins has been developed (64) . All of the abovementioned vaccines induced fair immune responses in animal models or humans. This suggests that the interference among antigens and the background effect of the DNA or virus vector could be minimized by constructing a universal vaccine with an appropriate vector by fusing the target antigens NP, PB1, and M1 or expressing two or more proteins using a dual promoter in a single vector. Various UIVs have been developed using several vaccine forms based on the combination of multiple antigens or epitopes, including recombinant subunit vaccines, DNA vaccines, and virus-vectored vaccines. In many cases, the immunization strategy of DNA prime-virus-vectored vaccine boosts was preferred because it induced a strong immune response (65, 66) . More importantly, the NP-based DNA prime-adenovirus boosting strategy significantly improves the NP-induced cross-protective effect (30) . In addition, DNA plasmids are good priming regimens in heterologous prime-boost vaccination against influenza A viruses in both animals and humans (67, 68) . In the current study, the DNA prime-rVV boost strategy induced effective protection against PR8 challenge. The PB1 antigen induced a stronger cellular immune response in mice via the pSCA-PB1 prime-rVV-PB1 boost strategy than that with either pSCA-PB1 or rVV-PB1 alone. Moreover, immunization using the NP-based vaccines with the pSCA-NP prime-rVV-NP boost strategy induced stronger cellular and humoral immune responses than did pSCA-NP or rVV-NP immunization alone. Furthermore, the pSCA-NP prime-rVV-NP boost strategy afforded protection against 10 LD 50 of PR8 challenge in mice, whereas neither pSCA-NP nor rVV-NP alone did. The M1 antigen was only weakly immunogenic, and although the pSCA-M1 prime-rVV-M1 boost immunization did not induce a marked cellular immune response, it enhanced the M1-specific humoral immune response and conferred a degree of protection in mice against challenge with 1.7 LD 50 of PR8. Finally, the combination vaccines based on NP-PB1-M1 administered using the DNA prime-rVV boost strategy also showed protection superior to that of the DNA or rVV vaccine alone. Accordingly, the DNA prime-rVV boost immunization strategy is superior to single DNA or rVV vaccine immunization. Previous data suggested that the prime-boost strategy not only increased the number of memory CD8 \u03e9 T cells but also enhanced the function of CD8 \u03e9 T cells (69) .",

Therefore, the protective immunity is mediated mainly by NP-, PB1-, or M1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) immune responses and nonneutralizing functions of specific antibodies (8) . In the current study, NP immunization induced specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, whereas PB1 immunization induced only a specific cellular response, and M1 immunization induced only a marked humoral immune response. This suggests that the NP-specific humoral and cellular immune responses, PB1-related cellular response, and M1-related humoral response might play roles in protection against heterologous challenge. This might explain the superior protection and immune response induced by NP immunization, as well as the poor protection and incomplete immune response induced by immunization with PB1 or M1. Thus, the immunogenicity of PB1 and M1 vaccines needs to be improved further to induce comprehensive immune responses and elicit cross-protection. In addition, although some exciting progress has been made in the current study, the immunogenicity of NP-, PB1-, and M1based DNA vaccines and vaccinia virus vector-based vaccines remains limited, and further optimization is needed regarding vaccine design, immunization strategies, delivery systems, and detection methods.",

To maintain consistency with the previous experiments, BALB/c mice were also used in the present study to confirm the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the NP-, M1-, and PB1-based universal vaccines. It is worth considering that although commonly used mouse strains generate strong T-cell responses to NP, BALB/c mice do not generate CTL responses against PB1 or M1 (72). Other mouse strains, such as CBA and C57/BL6, mount stronger responses against PB1, making it likely that PB1-or M1-based universal vaccines might induce better immune responses and protective effects in these mouse strains.

In previous clinical studies, the vaccinia virus-vectored vaccine was generally safe and well tolerated, with significantly fewer local side effects after intramuscular administration than after intradermal administration; thus, the intramuscular injection was preferred and administered to volunteers (39, 44, 76) .

NP was the most effective of the three antigens and conferred protection against heterologous PR8 challenge. UIVs based on a combination of NP, PB1, and M1 would likely induce strong immune responses; therefore, they might be an alternative approach for preventing future influenza virus pandemics.",
