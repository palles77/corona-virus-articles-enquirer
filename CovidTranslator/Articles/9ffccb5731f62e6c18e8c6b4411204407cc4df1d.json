In January 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlined several recommendations (2) . In the event of a serious outbreak, employers must play a key role in protecting employees' health and safety (2) . Specifi cally, businesses should \"forecast and allow for employee absences during a pandemic due to factors such as personal illness, family member illness, community containment measures and quarantines, school and/or business closures, and public transportation closures\" and workers should \"plan for the possible reduction or loss of income if [they are] unable to work or if place of employment is closed\" (2) .",

Previous research suggests that compliance with recommendations in emergency situations refl ects the interaction of many modifi able and nonmodifiable factors, including how persons perceive their personal and family risk, what resources they have available, what negative consequences they anticipate as a result of compliance, their socioeconomic status, and how well offi cial planning efforts are organized (3) (4) (5) (6) . Attitudes toward the use of social distancing to mitigate outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, smallpox, or avian infl uenza may be infl uenced by largely modifi able problems that people associate with isolation, such as not being able to get healthcare or prescription drugs and losing pay or jobs for missing work (7) . Indeed, more than one third of US employees say that they would not get paid if they had to stay home from work because of a severe outbreak of pandemic infl uenza, and less than one third believe that they could work from home for 1 month (8) .",

Because adults with children were oversampled to gauge the possible effect of community mitigation on families, data were weighted to refl ect the actual proportion of the total adult population. In addition, to compensate for nonresponse bias and unequal probability of selection and to ensure that demographic groups were represented in their actual proportion in the adult population, we weighted sample data to the most recent US census data available from the Current Population Survey (www.census.gov/cps) for gender, age, race, region, and education.",

Evidence to determine the most effective nonpharmaceutical intervention strategies is limited (12) . Some strategies being suggested include targeted, layered containment (13) , which involves antiviral drug treatment for identifi ed case-patients and prophylaxis for and quarantine of their household members, school closures, and social distancing in the community and workplace (2, 8, 13, 14) . Research has suggested that US adults seem to possess a broad willingness to comply with response strategies that include social distancing, although some segments of the population will likely be less able to comply with isolation recommendations (8) , particularly those related to isolation from the workplace.",

US health authorities recommend that to prepare for a pandemic, businesses should establish policies for nonpunitive liberal leave and fl exible worksite accommodations (2) . However, we know of no legal precedent for mandatory job protection in the event of public health emergencies. Our study found that employees without paid sick leave, those with low income, and those who live in urban areas fear losing their jobs should they comply with recommendations to stay home in the event of a serious outbreak of pandemic infl uenza. Those respondents who said that they would not be paid if kept from work were almost 5\u00d7 more likely as those who would receive pay to say that they would lose their job or business as a result of having to stay home from work. We were not surprised by this fi nding, given the long history of social epidemiology literature (e.g., the Whitehall studies) that has documented the effect of occupational status or grade, organizational injustice, job stress, and workplace power differentials on both job insecurity and disease outcomes (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . The effect of lack of paid sick leave provides insight into a measure of inequality in the work force, such that some groups of employees (e.g., those in minimum wage jobs or without paid sick leave), because of concerns about job security that stem from their workplace status, lack the power to choose to stay home from work in the event of an outbreak. Notably, across all income categories, low-and middle-income workers were signifi cantly more likely than high-income workers to say that they would be likely to lose their job or business as a result of staying home for 7-10 days in the event of an outbreak. Those respondents living in urban areas also were 60% more likely than those living in rural areas to fear job insecurity. This fear could pose substantial problems for pandemic infl uenza mitigation because those in urban areas may be strongly encouraged to remain isolated to avoid virus spread in conditions of population density and crowding.",

Although US health authorities have recommended that businesses develop policies for employee compensation in the event of an infl uenza pandemic that causes workplace absences (2), we know of no precedent requiring that paid sick leave be granted (by employers or state or federal government) to employees who comply with isolation recommendations and miss work in the event of a public health emergency. Our study has elucidated some employment characteristics that are associated with the likelihood that workers think they would experience serious fi nancial problems if they had to miss work; inability to work from home and lack of paid sick leave were associated with reports of experiencing serious fi nancial problems if isolated from work over the 3 periods: 7-10 days, 1 month, and 3 months. Respondent income was another signifi cant predictor of serious fi nancial problems that may limit ability to comply with isolation recommendations. Even relatively short periods of isolation from the workplace (7-10 days) would be a problem for low-income workers, and if an outbreak were serious enough to warrant 1-month isolation recommendations, persons in low-and middle-income groups would have more diffi culty complying than would upper-income groups, thus limiting the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. Moreover, at 3 months' of isolation, persons from all income levels, especially low-income, would likely experience serious fi nancial problems.",

These strategies may include working with employers to ensure work-fromhome or sick leave capabilities for nonessential employees and planning to provide state or federal supplementary income support and job protection for workers who would not be paid if they missed work because of offi cial pandemic mitigation recommendations. Other countries have implemented similar measures in emergencies; for example, during the 2003 pandemic of severe acute respiratory disease, the government of Singapore provided fi nancial support to citizens who had to stay home to prevent the spread of the disease (21) . In the United States, no such measures have been taken to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, but for other emergencies such as hurricanes and fl oods, federal income support has been provided to victims by way of disaster relief funds. In the event of a serious outbreak of pandemic infl uenza, when timely action will be needed to encourage and ensure isolation compliance, an existing mechanism for delivering fi nancial support to affected persons is unemployment insurance. Currently, eligibility requirements for this benefi t are limited to employees who involuntarily lose their job, but this requirement could be changed to use an existing system to disperse lump-sum payments to those fi nancially affected by a pandemic, if the severity of an outbreak warranted isolation from the workplace for long periods.",

Low response rates can bias samples, refl ecting systematic differences between responders and the population from which they were drawn, thus limiting the external validity of estimates (extrapolation to the general population). However, the 1-month period of the survey (and thus limited time for callbacks) may mirror what might be necessary in the event of a pandemic, in which public surveys with a rapid turnaround time are necessary to gauge public knowledge and resource needs in an emergency situation. We point to research that suggests that the results of weighted data from surveys of shorter duration are similar to those based on surveys of longer duration and higher response rates and can be used without an unacceptable risk for bias (22, 23) . Furthermore, the HSPH Pandemic Infl uenza Survey, as it relates to our fi ndings about job insecurity, did not assess perceptions of job loss versus reality of job loss, nor did it assess reasons why some respondents perceived that job loss would be a consequence for missing work for 7-10 days in the event of a serious outbreak. Future population surveys could attempt to disentangle these beliefs to inform policy and communication aimed at enabling compliance with workplace isolation strategies to quell the spread of a future pandemic.",
