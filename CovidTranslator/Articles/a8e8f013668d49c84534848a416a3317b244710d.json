There is thus an urgent need for investment in technologies such as virus (or viral pseudotype) neutralization assays and other robust assays which provide reliable read-outs of protective immunity, and for the provision of open access to valuable data sources such as blood banks and paired samples of acute and convalescent sera from confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 to validate these. Urgent development and assessment of such tests should be followed by rapid implementation at scale to provide real-time data. These data will be critical to the proper assessment of the effects of social distancing and other measures currently being adopted to slow down the case incidence and for informing future policy direction.",

This proportion is itself only a fraction of the risk groups already well described in the literature [1] [2] [3] [4] , including the elderly and those carrying critical comorbidities (e.g. asthma). We used a susceptible-infectious-recovered framework (SIRf) to examine the effects of varying the vulnerable fraction of the population on the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, fixing other model parameters to ranges supported by previous studies (Table 1) . We fit the model to cumulative deaths in the United Kingdom and Italy in the first 15 days following the first recorded death to avoid any potential effects of local control strategies implemented since that time.

The model output (posterior) for time of introduction (the start of transmission) place this event a couple of days after the first confirmed case in the country, and over a month before the first confirmed death ( Figures  1E-F) . In both R 0 scenarios, by the time the first death was reported (05/03/2020), thousands of individuals (~0.08%) would have already been infected with the virus (as also suggested by [5] ). By 19/03/2020, approximately 36% (R 0 =2.25) and 40% (R 0 =2.75) of the population would have already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. Running the same model with R 0 =2.25 and the proportion of the population at risk of severe disease being distributed around 0.1%, places the start of transmission at 4 days prior to first case detection and 38 days before the first confirmed death and suggests that 68% would have been infected by 19/03/2020. The results of the same exercise for Italy ( Figure 2 ) place the time of introduction around 10 days before the first confirmed case, and around a month before the first confirmed death (Figures 2E-F) when the proportion of the population at risk of severe disease is around 1%. By 06/03/2020, approximately 45 days post introduction, the model suggests that approximately 60% (R 0 = 2.25) and 64% (R 0 = 2.75) of the population would have already been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. When the proportion of the population at risk is around 0.1%, the start of transmission is likely to have occurred 17 days prior to first case detection and 38 days before the first confirmed death with 80% already infected by 06/03/2020.",
