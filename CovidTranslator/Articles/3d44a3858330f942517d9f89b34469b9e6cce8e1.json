The pattern of HSV-1 staining in the ciliary body of IFN\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice was similar to that seen in IFN\u03b3+/+ mice; however, more of the ciliary body was HSV-1+ in IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice (Figure 2 ). HSV-1+ staining was observed in the central retina in 25% (1/4), 38% (3/8), and 50% (4/8) of IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice at 48, 72 and 120 hours p.i., respectively (not shown).

The amount of HSV-1 staining in the central retina appeared to be similar between IFN\u03b3\u2212/\u2212 mice and IFN\u03b3+/+ mice.

The front line of immune defense in vertebrates is the innate response during which macrophages and neutrophils recognize, ingest and kill invading pathogens. Macrophages secrete cytokines which activate NK cells and dendritic cells that are then recruited to the site of infection resulting in activation of adaptive immune response including T and B cells. In absence of T-cells, mice infected with HSV-1 in the AC develop bilateral retinitis. However, in these mice the virus gains access to the ipsilateral retina via connections of the contralateral suprachiasmatic nucleus to the ipsilateral optic nerve and retina and not via direct spread of virus from the infected anterior segment [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Na\u00efve T cells are continuously migrating between the circulating blood and lymphoid tissue awaiting activation by antigen presenting cells and are therefore more likely to contribute to protection of the ipsilateral retina after day 5 9, 11, 16 . Neutrophils and NK cells also appear to be critical to protection of the ipsilateral retina; however, these cell types are detected later in infection (on and after day 4 p.i.), while the number of Mac-1+ (i.e., activated microglia) in the injected eye peaks before day 4 p.i.

IFN\u03b3, produced by cells of the innate and adaptive immune system (NK cells, macrophages, neutrophils and T cells), is appropriately known as the \"immune interferon\" [19] [20] [21] [22] . Studies of overexpression of IFN\u03b3 and infection of IFN\u03b3 deficient mice have shown that IFN\u03b3 plays an important role in viral pathogenesis. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . We have shown that the absence of IFN\u03b3 does not dramatically affect spread of HSV-1 from the anterior segment to the posterior segment and retina in the injected eye following uniocular AC inoculation of virus. IFN\u03b3 is produced by immune cell types that are located in the anterior segment and are in position to mediate protection of the ipsilateral retina, 15-17, 20, 22 however depletion of single cell types or cytokines does not result in panretinal HSV-1 infection 11, 14, 15 . Taken together, these findings support the idea that in the mouse, the timing and appearance of different cell types and cytokines is critical to protection of the retina from infection due to direct spread of virus. The roles of macrophages, microglia and cytokines (i.e., IFN\u03b3) in preventing intraocular virus spread in human patients remains to be elucidated, but it is likely that similar to what has been observed in the mouse, in humans there are multiple factors which contribute to protection against virus spread in the eye and timing of appearance of these factors is important.
