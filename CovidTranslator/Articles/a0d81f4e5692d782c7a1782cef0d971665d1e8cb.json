The nucleotide sequences encoding the entire S, sM, M and N genes open reading frame (ORF) of DX were 4 152, 231, 681 and 1 326 bases long respectively. There were transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) upstream of the initiator ATG of the S, N and M genes. The amino acids sequences of S, M and N contained 30, 3 and 7 potential asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites. Homologous analysis and phylogenetic trees showed that DX had the closest relationship with strains LJB/06, JS-2004-2Z and CH/HLJH/06 that were also isolated from China and indicated the prevalence of some PEDV isolates in China were widespread since the JS-2004-2Z strain originated from the south of the China, and LJB/06 and CH/HLJH/06 were isolated from northeast China. The N gene was cloned using two primers which contained Nco I and BamH I restriction enzyme sites and subcloned into expression vector pET30a. The recombinant plasmid was then transformed into E.coli Rossta. SDS-PAGE showed there was a protein of about 55kDa as expected and Western blot indicated the N protein had biological activity.",

The N protein participates in transcription of the viral genome, the formation of the viral core, and packaging of viral RNA. In the early stage of PEDV infection, the pig produces high levels of antibodies against the protein N. Since the N protein is highly conservative in the coronaviruses, it has a good response and immunogenicity, so it is the best candidate protein for early diagnosis reagents and vaccine development.",

Like other PEDV strains, the sequence GUAAAC were found at 8 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG of the DX S gene, a similar sequence can also found in other coronavirus upstream of the initiator of the S gene. Common with other PEDV S protein sequences, the DX S protein has a GxCx motif and a conserved nonamer at the S1-S2 junctional region (Fig. 1). Between these two motifs there is a protein restriction site, such that the S protein can be cut into S1 and S2 in the course of virus of Coronavirus II infection which can enhance the virus infectivity. The DX S protein contains 30 potential asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites and a region of hydrophobic residues at positions 1327-1349 which is assumed to function as a membrane anchor similarly, the Chinju99 and Br1/87 contained 27 and 29 potential asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites and hydrophobic regions between positions 1327-1349 and 1322-1337 (19). The results revealed that the structure N, M and sM genes had an ORF coding for a protein of 441, 226 and 57 amino acids respectively. Sequence analysis showed that all the reference strains in this study had the same lengths for the DX sequence for nucleotides and amino acids N, M and sM. The N and M protein of DX contained 7 and 4 potential asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites, the N protein of Chinju99 and LJB/03 had same number of potential asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites as DX (8,11). The sequence AGAAAC and AUAAAC were also found at 9 and 11 nucleotides respectively upstream of the initiator of the N and M gene of the PEDV DX strain, Coronaviruses have transcription regulatory sequences (TRSs) that include a highly conserved core sequence (CS, previously named the intergenic sequence [IS]) 5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032, or a related sequence, depending on the coronavirus, at sites immediately upstream of most of the genes (14). Although TRSs are conserved among the TGEV (Transmissible gastroenteritis viurus) that also belong to the coronavirus group I, mutation frequently occurs in PEDV TRSs, especially in the first two nucleotides of the TRSs and no TRS was found upstream the sM gene of the DX strain.",
