L-SIGN, encoded by CLEC4M (also known as CD209L), is a SARS-CoV binding receptor that has polymorphism in its extracellular neck region encoded by the tandem repeat domain in exon 4. Our genetic risk association study shows that individuals homozygous for CLEC4M tandem repeats are less susceptible to SARS infection. L-SIGN is expressed in both non-SARS and SARS-CoV-infected lung. Compared with cells heterozygous for L-SIGN, cells homozygous for L-SIGN show higher binding capacity for SARS-CoV, higher proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a lower capacity for trans infection. Thus, homozygosity for L-SIGN plays a protective role during SARS infection.",

Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) is the only known functional receptor for SARS-CoV infection 6 . Sequence analysis has shown that the SARS-CoV spike proteins have multiple N-linked glycosylation sites and share great similarity in the sequence motifs with the HIV envelope proteins 7 , suggesting a similar binding pattern between these two viruses.",

Unlike DC-SIGN, which is expressed, for example, on dendritic cells, L-SIGN is expressed in the liver, lymph nodes and placenta 9,10 . The extracellular regions of both CLEC4M and CD209 contain tandem repeats of a highly conserved 23-amino acid sequence, followed by a C-terminal C-type carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) [11] [12] [13] . In contrast to CD209, CLEC4M has considerable polymorphism in the tandem repeat domain of exon 4, which consists of three to nine repeats of a 69-base pair segment, with seven repeats being predominant (450%) in the general population 10 . This tandem repeat segment encodes the extracellular neck region and has been suggested to be important for homo-oligomerization of L-SIGN on the cell surface, which brings the CRDs into proximity for high-affinity ligand binding 10,11 . It has been suggested that heterozygous expression of polymorphic variants of L-SIGN, in which neck lengths differ, may prevent the formation of hetero-oligomers and may thus lead to a reduced ligand-binding affinity 8 .",

Recently, it has been shown that pseudotyped lentiviral particles presenting SARS-CoV spike protein can bind to both DC-SIGN 18 and L-SIGN 19 . Recent data have further demonstrated that L-SIGN can bind SARS-CoV 20 . It has also been shown that individual susceptibility to SARS infection may depend on genetic factors of the host: for example, HLA class I polymorphism 21, 22 . As L-SIGN can bind SARS-CoV and its homo-or heterozygosity may determine the ligand-binding capacity, we hypothesized that CLEC4M homo-or heterozygosity might affect individual susceptibility to SARS infection. We therefore performed a genetic risk association study and a series of in vitro experiments to examine the biological role of L-SIGN in SARS infection.",

To analyze whether the status of being a health care worker may have an impact on susceptibility, we performed a similar analysis separately in the non-health care worker population and health care worker populations. In the non-health care worker population, community SARS versus outpatient controls gave an odds ratio of 0.698 (95% c.i. \u00bc 0.490-0.993, P \u00bc 0.045; Table 2 ). In the health care worker population, health care workers with SARS versus health care worker controls demonstrated an odds ratio of 0.536 for homozygotes (95% c.i. \u00bc 0.303-0.950, P \u00bc 0.031; Table 2 ). In the stratified analysis between these two populations, the test of heterogeneity comparing the reduced odds ratios in the non-health care worker and the health care worker populations (odds ratio \u00bc 0.698 and 0.536, respectively) did not demonstrate a significant difference (P \u00bc 0.442, Table 2 ). This subsequently allowed us to perform a test for overall association based on the non-health care worker and health care worker populations between the SARS patients and control subjects. Results again demonstrated an overall odds ratio of 0.649 (95% c.i. \u00bc 0.481-0.876, P \u00bc 0.005, Table 2 ), further confirming that a reduced risk was associated with homozygotes, irrespective of whether an individual was a health care worker. Furthermore, as the outpatient controls and the random controls did not differ from each other in their individual genotype frequencies or homo-or heterozygote frequencies (P \u00bc 0.737 and 0.755, respectively, Table 1 ), these two controls were grouped together as 'combined controls' . Analysis of all SARS patients versus combined controls again gave an odds ratio of 0.691 for homozygotes (95% c.i. \u00bc 0.523-0.913, P \u00bc 0.009). On the other hand, analysis of the allele and genotype frequencies showed that the effect of differences in allele or genotype frequencies was either absent or inconsistent ( Table 3) ,",

We performed FISH for ACE2 and in situ hybridization for L-SIGN (Fig. 1b) on the same sections. In lung samples, we identified SARS-CoV antigen in cells coexpressing ACE2 and L-SIGN (Fig. 1b) . We did not detect viral antigens in L-SIGN bright ACE2 dim/cells (Fig. 1b) . We also identified SARS-CoV antigen in L-SIGN dim/-ACE2 dim/cells (Fig. 1b) . In small bowel The differences in allele frequencies between SARS patients and control subjects were either marginally significant (P \u00bc 0.040 for the non-HCW population) or not significant (P \u00bc 0.510 for the HCW population). Similarly, the differences in genotype frequencies were either not significant (P \u00bc 0.111 for the non-HCW population) or marginally significant (P \u00bc 0.044 for the HCW population). The comparison between all SARS cases and random controls is not significant for either allele or genotype frequencies. L-SIGN mediates proteasome-dependent viral degradation CHO cells, which do not express ACE2 (data not shown), were transiently transfected with L-SIGN containing seven tandem repeats (N7 L-SIGN/CHO, where N denotes 'neck'), five repeats (N5), or both seven and five repeats (N7/N5 cotransfectants) in exon 4. These transfectants expressed high levels of L-SIGN on post-transfection day 2, and flow cytometry analysis confirmed that levels of surface expression were comparable for both the heterozygous and homozygous forms (data not shown). The transfectants (2.5 \u00c2 10 4 cells) were pulsed with 1 plaque forming unit (PFU) of SARS-CoV per cell for 1 h at 4 1C. After extensive washing, the cells were lysed and RNA was obtained for analysis of the copy number of ORF-1b sequence as described 24 . ORF-1b is a genomic RNA of SARS-CoV, and part of it encodes the viral polymerase 25, 26 . Cultures of all three transfectants had a higher viral genomic copy number than the mock transfectants. Furthermore, homozygous N7 and N5 L-SIGN/CHO cells had a higher binding capacity than heterozygous N7/N5 transfectants (Fig. 2a) . Binding of SARS-CoV to these transfectants was confirmed to be L-SIGN-dependent, as ORF-1b copy numbers were substantially reduced when blocking monoclonal antibodies against L-SIGN were included during the viral pulse and incubation (Fig. 2a) .",

After 4 h, the total viral ORF-1b copy number in wells treated with proteasome inhibitors was significantly higher than those treated with solvent control (Fig. 2c) . Treatment with proteasome inhibitors for 4 h did not lead to excessive cell death, but a substantial After extensive washing, cells were subsequently cultured for 24 h or 48 h with fresh Vero E6 cells, which express ACE2 (data not shown) and have been used for in vitro propagation for SARS-CoV in our laboratory. Quantification of the viral genomic ORF-1b transcripts showed that higher final copy numbers were noted in cultures with N7/N5 cells than with homozygous N7 or N5 cells after pulsing with either 1 PFU/cell or 0.01 PFU/cell (Fig. 3a) , although this difference was not observed at 48 h ( Supplementary Fig. 3 online) . Moreover, after initial viral pulse with 0.01 PFU/cell and incubation for 24 h, total viral copy number significantly increased in cultures of fresh Vero E6 cells with virus-pulsed L-SIGN/CHO cells, but not with virus-pulsed mock transfectants (CHO; Fig. 3a ). These results imply that L-SIGN can deliver SARS-CoV to permissive cells in trans, and that 24 h after exposure to SARS-CoV, homozygous N7 and N5 L-SIGN/CHO cells have a lower ability for trans infection than heterozygous N7/N5 transfectants. Because ACE2 + L-SIGN + cells that contained SARS-CoV antigen were identified in our SARS lung and small bowel samples (Fig. 1b,c) , it is possible that L-SIGN may also be able to facilitate cis infection of SARS-CoV. To examine this possibility, Vero E6 cells transfected with N7 or N7/N5 L-SIGN were infected with 0.01 PFU/cell SARS CoV. At least 60% of the cells expressed surface L-SIGN on day 2 posttransfection as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). After 1 h at 37 1C, we washed the cells and further incubated them for 24 h and 48 h and subsequently measured total ORF-1b and nucleocapsid copy number. Expression of N7 or N7/N5 L-SIGN on transfected Vero E6 cells ('L-SIGN/Vero') did not result in higher viral ORF-1b (Fig. 3b, left) or nucleocapsid (Fig. 3b, right) copy numbers. Infection of Vero E6 cells with 1 PFU/cell induced substantial cell death after 24 h and 48 h culture owing to the cytopathic effect of the virus (data not shown), precluding studies using this higher titer. Because the majority of nucleocapsid gene sequence was derived from subgenomic mRNA produced upon active replication 28, 29 , the results indicate that the virus replicates with the same efficiency in these cells.",

Infection of fresh Vero E6 cells for 48 h with serially titrated supernatants harvested from the 48 h culture of infected N7 L-SIGN/Vero E6 cells indeed resulted in a substantially lower final viral genomic copy number than did infection with supernatants from infected N7/N5 L-SIGN/Vero cells and mock transfectants ( Supplementary Fig. 5 online). To exclude the possibility that expression of N7 L-SIGN in permissive cells might interfere with virus budding or release, N7 L-SIGN/Vero cultures were treated with antibodies against L-SIGN before and during the viral pulse and subsequent 48 h incubation. Notably, blockade of surface L-SIGN resulted in an increase of the number of viral genomic copies in the supernatants, with a reciprocal decrease in cell lysates (Fig. 4b) .",

Vero E6 cells were also cultured with the same number of parental CHO cells as controls. We did not conduct any washes in this experiment in order to maintain a constant viral titer for infection (that is, a closed system). There was no difference in the total number of viral ORF-1b copies (in both cellular lysates and supernatant) at 24 h of culture (data not shown), but there was a significant reduction in the viral genomic copy number at 48 h in 1:1 Vero:N5 L-SIGN/CHO cultures than in 1:1 Vero:N7/N5 CHO cultures (Fig. 5a) . The total number of nucleocapsid transcripts was also significantly lower in cultures of homozygous N5 L-SIGN transfectants than in cultures of heterozygous N7/N5 (Fig. 5b) . In addition, a stable clone of N2 L-SIGN/CHO was also obtained after prolonged culture of a stable N7 clone that subsequently lost five tandem repeats. When these N2 L-SIGN/CHO cells were cultured with Vero E6 cells and subsequently exposed to 0.01 PFU/cell SARS-CoV in a closed infection system, total ORF-1b copy number was lower than in cultures with parental CHO cells ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).",

As 22% of all SARS cases in Hong Kong were health care workers 23 , it is likely that the unaffected health care workers recruited for study may represent a preselected group with overrepresentation of homozygotic genotypes. Nevertheless, direct comparison of SARSinfected individuals and the corresponding controls, together with the stratified analysis, shows that CLEC4M homozygotes are significantly less susceptible to SARS infection, irrespective whether an individual is a health care worker ( Table 2) . Such a reduced risk is associated with L-SIGN homozygosity per se, rather than any specific allele or genotype ( It has been reported that the primary organ for SARS-CoV infection is lung 31, 32 , and virus has also been detected in small bowel of patients fatally infected with SARS-CoV 33 . Using in situ hybridization and immunohistology, we have shown the presence of L-SIGN + cells in nonlesional lung samples from lung cancer patients who had no SARS infection. These L-SIGN + cells are either ACE2 bright or ACE2 dim/- (Fig. 1a) , implying that L-SIGN may be expressed by at least two different subsets of cells. Indeed, in a separate study we found that L-SIGN bright ACE2 dim/cells expressed cytokeratin, indicating that they are epithelial cells, as also suggested in a recent report 20 . In contrast, L-SIGN bright ACE2 bright cells do not express cytokeratin (data not shown). The nature of these cells is unknown and needs to be further characterized. Although L-SIGN bright ACE2 dim/cells are consistently found in lung tissue of all non-SARS samples, L-SIGN bright ACE2 bright cells are found only in samples from half of the non-SARS individuals (four of eight); this needs further investigation. Nevertheless, the finding that L-SIGN is consistently expressed in cells that expressed both SARS-CoV antigen and ACE2 in the lung and small bowel of patients fatally infected with SARS (Fig. 1b,c) strongly suggests that L-SIGN may be involved in SARS-CoV infection. Notably, SARS antigen is found in L-SIGN dim/-ACE2 dim/cells in SARSinfected lung (Fig. 1b) . The nature of these virus-containing cells that do not express the only known functional receptor, ACE2, is unclear, but they are not alveolar macrophages, because they do not express CD68 ( Supplementary Fig. 7 online) , a macrophage-specific marker 34 .",

After binding to L-SIGN, there is no or little viral dissociation, and viruses undergo degradation over time, with the homozygous cells more efficient than the heterozygous cells (Fig. 2b) . It has been reported that levels of SARS-CoV subgenomic RNA were increased 24 h after infection of L-SIGN-expressing cells 20 . However, such an increase was transient, and SARS-CoV antigen was detected by immunofluorescence staining in fewer than 1% of the infected L-SIGN-expressing cells 20 , which argues against efficient and productive viral replication mediated by L-SIGN. Furthermore, L-SIGNmediated viral degradation is, at least in part, proteasome-dependent, because it can be inhibited partially by proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 2c) , although interference with proteasomes may also lead to indirect inhibition of upstream processes involved in the degradation of endocytosed SARS-CoV particles.",

Expression of L-SIGN on permissive cells facilitates trans, but not cis, infection of SARS-CoV, at least when cells are initially infected with 0.01 PFU/cell (Fig. 3) , a titer that may be more representative of the setting of primary infection than a higher one. The observation that N7 L-SIGN/CHO cells bind SARS-CoV more efficiently but mediate a poorer trans infection than N7/N5expressing cells is interesting. It is likely that a higher binding capacity may lead to more efficient internalization and degradation, thereby resulting in a lower ability for trans delivery of the virus. In separate experiments in which the viral copy number was determined a b 3 separately in cell lysates and supernatants, the cell lysates of SARSinfected homozygous N7 L-SIGN/Vero cells contained significantly higher viral copy number than those of heterozygous N7/N5 L-SIGN/ Vero cells (Fig. 4a) . This finding is consistent with a recent report that after infection with SARS-CoV spike protein-containing pseudotyped virus and incubation for 3 d, the luciferase activity in the cell lysates, which should correlate with the viral copy number, is higher in nonpermissive cells transfected with both ACE2 and N7 L-SIGN than in cells transfected with ACE2 alone 19 . Reciprocally, supernatants of SARS-infected homozygous N7 L-SIGN/Vero cells have a significantly lower viral copy number than supernatants of heterozygous N7/ N5 L-SIGN/Vero cells (Fig. 4b) . This implies that cells expressing N7 L-SIGN, but not heterozygous N7/N5, seem to retain a high proportion of viruses in a cell-associated form, leading to decreased levels of infectious virions in the supernatants. Taken together, we suggest that L-SIGN expressed on permissive cells (such as in L-SIGN bright ACE2 bright cells; Fig. 1 ) may actually capture or sequester SARS viruses that have been liberated after replication, at least after 48 h incubation, when the viral copy numbers significantly increase. Capture, absorption and degradation of the released viruses via binding to L-SIGN would result in a lower amount of infectious virions in the local environment, which could limit subsequent viral spread to other permissive cells for further infection. In vivo, however, the outcome of SARS-CoV infection is likely to be a combination of L-SIGN-mediated capturing, internalization and degradation and/or trans delivery of virus to permissive cells. In a closed infection system in which no wash procedures were conducted in order to maintain a constant titer for infection, we demonstrated that cultures of permissive cells with homozygous, but not heterozygous, L-SIGN-expressing cells have significantly lower final viral genomic and subgenomic copy numbers (Fig. 5) . This observation confirms that homozygous L-SIGN does have a protective role in SARS-CoV infection.",

This observation is supported by our in vitro studies showing that homozygous L-SIGN plays a protective role by reducing the final total viral titers in cultures with permissive cells. In part this can be attributed to an increased binding capacity of homozygous L-SIGN which results in greater cell association of virions, increased proteasome-dependent viral degradation and a consequent lower capacity for trans infection. Our results show a novel role of L-SIGN in SARS infection. Whether our findings are also relevant to the pathogenesis and disease susceptibility of other L-SIGN-binding pathogens deserves further investigation.",
