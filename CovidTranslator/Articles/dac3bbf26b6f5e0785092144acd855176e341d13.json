            "text": "An outbreak of cryptosporidiosis occurred in a mixed sheep/cattle farm of Central Italy in October 2011. A total of 450 ovines (250 sheep and 200 lambs) and 140 bovines (130 cows and 10 calves) were housed in two separated units, at the time of the outbreak. About half of the lambs had diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium sp. with a mortality rate of 80%; calves were not infected. Genomic DNA was extracted from an archived slide and from fecal specimens, and the parasite was identified as Cryptosporidium parvum by PCR and sequence analysis at the CpA135 gene. Genotyping at the GP60 gene showed the presence of a very rare genotype, IIaA20G2R1. Shortly after the outbreak was identified, the son of the farm's owner, aged 18 months, experienced an acute gastroenteritis and was hospitalized due to recurrent episodes of diarrhea, fever, vomiting and lack of appetite. The feces tested negative for bacteria and viruses, whereas cryptosporidiosis was diagnosed by microscopy and an immunochromatographic test. Molecular typing identified the C. parvum genotype IIaA20G2R1 in the feces of the child. This is the first case of transmission of cryptosporidiosis in Italy involving lambs as source of oocysts infectious to humans.",

The infection is transmitted through the fecal-oral route, and the extreme robustness of the oocysts, the infective stage of Cryptosporidium parasites, accounts for the importance of indirect transmission through ingestion of contaminated water and food (Smith et al., 2006) . In humans, cryptosporidiosis is mainly due to Cryptosporidium hominis, a species with a predominant anthroponotic cycle, and to Cryptosporidium parvum, a zoonotic species with a significant impact on young ruminants (Cacci\u00f2 et al., 2005; Xiao, 2010) . C. hominis is the species responsible for the majority of human cases in the United States, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia, while C. parvum accounts for more human cases in Europe and particularly in the United Kingdom (Chako et al., 2010) .",

The gut also tested negative for Coronavirus and Rotavirus. On the other hand, Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts were detected microscopically after Kynioun staining, and cryptosporidiosis was further confirmed by an ELISA test. On December 2, 2011, fecal samples were collected from 21 adult sheep, 6 lambs and 6 calves and tested for the presence of Cryptosporidium sp. oocysts.

The main symptom was non-bloody diarrhea, without fever and vomiting, that lasted for at least four weeks. Laboratory tests ruled out common bacterial species (Salmonella, Campylobacter and Shigella) as the cause of diarrhea, and the child was prescribed with a rehydration therapy and probiotics. However, his conditions worsened and he was hospitalized on November 10, 2011, because of episodes of diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and lack of appetite. Laboratory tests ruled out Rotavirus and Adenovirus as a cause of diarrhea, whereas both microscopy and immunochromatography revealed the presence of Cryptosporidium sp. The child received a parenteral rehydration therapy for 18 h and during the hospitalization he had no further episodes of vomiting or diarrhea, and no fever. He started to eat and drink normally and was discharged on November 13, 2011. Notably, a fecal sample collected from the child during a control visit on November 29, 2011, tested positive for Cryptosporidium by immunofluorescence, indicating an incomplete clearance of the infection. The child had no direct contact with the infected animals; therefore the exposure must have been indirect, likely by an accidental ingestion of oocysts carried on his father's working clothes and/or footwear. Indeed, the father used to pick up his child from a childcare centre directly from the farm.",

The infection in lambs was particularly severe, with a mortality rate close to 80%, and the parasite was the only pathogen identified, as tests for both bacteria and viruses were negative. The analysis of fecal samples collected from lambs after the outbreak indicated that two genotypes, IIaA20G2R1 and IIaA15G2R1, were present in the farm. It should be noted that the IIaA20G2R1 subtype has been previously identified only in neonatal calves in Northern Ireland (Thompson et al., 2007) , but not in humans or in other animals. This findings, together with the timing in the onset of symptoms, i.e., first in animals and then in the child, strongly suggest that the child acquired the infection from oocysts shed by the infected lambs. However, transmission must have been indirect, as the children had no contact with the infected animals, and could have resulted from an accidental exposure to oocysts carried by his father on working clothes. Interestingly, the child was excreting oocysts even after the regression of symptoms, albeit in much lower number, but no transmission occurred among other family members.",
