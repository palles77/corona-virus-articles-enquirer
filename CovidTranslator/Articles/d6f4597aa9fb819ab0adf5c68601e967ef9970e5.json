The remaining 2 studies were respectively associated with IME values of 2.20 and 3.62. 3, 4 Consensus Summary Statement: The overall evidence that FIP infection induces IMHA in cats is negligible. However, given the immune mechanisms underlying effusive FIP, combined with the lack of conclusive studies, a role for this virus in IMHA cannot be ruled out. Of note, false positive Coombs', saline agglutination, and flow cytometric assays for surface antibody may hypothetically occur as a consequence of non-specific antibody adsorption to RBCs.",
