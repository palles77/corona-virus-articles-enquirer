The lung is constantly exposed to microorganisms and the combined effects of pathogen, host, and environmental factors determine whether or not the clinical condition known as pneumonia occurs. Pneumonia is generally more prevalent in low-and middle-income countries. Incidence is highest at the extremes of ages such as the elderly and infants. The overwhelming majority of pneumonia deaths in infants and young children occur in low-income settings.",

The term 'community-acquired pneumonia' (CAP) refers to the appearance of infection in a non-hospitalized population with no risk factors for multi-drug-resistant pathogens whereas the term 'hospital acquired pneumonia' or 'nosocomial pneumonia' is used when there is no evidence that the infection was present or incubating at the time of hospital admission. The latter type of pneumonia is most frequently found in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, hence the term 'ventilator-associated pneumonia.' Another classification in common use in children with community-acquired pneumonia in resource-limited settings is based on clinical severity, and is used to guide management decisions such as antibiotic treatment, hospitalization and oxygen therapy.",

            "text": "Childhood pneumonia can be caused by a wide range of pathogens, and knowledge of the common causative pathogens in high-burden settings is important to inform the choice of antibiotic therapy and potential preventive strategies, such as immunization. However, it is difficult to accurately determine etiology because of limitations concerning both clinical samples and laboratory analysis. It is difficult to obtain clinical samples for microbiological examination from the lower respiratory tract: percutaneous transthoracic fine needle lung aspiration is regarded as the gold standard sample and while relatively low-risk is little practiced (Scott and Hall, 1999) ; bronchoalveolar lavage is generally not done only in low-income country settings; and sputum samples obtained by nebulized saline induction can be contaminated during passage through the upper respiratory tract limiting their diagnostic value. Blood culture and chest radiograph are the traditional mainstays of diagnosis but blood culture is insensitive and chest radiography poorly specific. In addition, it is increasingly recognized that etiology can be complex and involve multiple pathogens. The etiologic spectrum for childhood pneumonia varies between settings and changes over time. Respiratory viruses are more prominent than bacterial pathogens in populations with better socioeconomic conditions and widespread use of bacterial conjugate vaccines, and pneumonia-related mortality is low in such settings. Etiology studies undertaken in the 1980s in low-income settings identified Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) as the common bacterial pathogens causing pneumonia in children (Shann, 1995) . These studies also identified a range of viral pathogens such as respiratory syncytial (RSV) and influenza viruses, but showed that the majority of pneumonia-related deaths were due to bacterial rather than viral pneumonia, with the exception of measles. In the past, pneumonia was a common cause of death in children with measles, either directly due to measles virus (giant cell pneumonia) or more commonly due to secondary bacterial pneumonia such as due to S. pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus.",

Early antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected infants will reduce pneumonia risk even further. While bacterial conjugate vaccines are not as protective in HIV-infected infants as HIV-uninfected infants, they still do provide some protective efficacy, and this is important given the high burden of bacterial pneumonia in HIV-infected infants. Furthermore, it may be that vaccine efficacy may be improved further if the infant is receiving antiretroviral therapy at the time of immunization, but there are no data to confirm this. Finally, infants that are exposed to tuberculosis in the household setting should be screened for tuberculosis, and if well should receive preventive therapy to reduce the risk of developing tuberculosis.",

Smoking is the strongest risk factor for invasive pneumococcal disease in immunocompetent non-elderly adults. HIV infection is a major risk factor for CAP in adults due to a wide range of pathogens including pneumococcus, and in tuberculosis endemic settings, M. tuberculosis is important, either as a direct cause or because adults with pulmonary tuberculosis are at greater risk of secondary bacterial pneumonia.

The decision regarding hospitalization is usually based on the stability of the clinical condition, the risk of death and complications, and the presence or absence of other medical problems and social characteristics. Severity or prognostic scores have been developed and evaluated that are used to identify patients who may be candidates for outpatient treatment. The most widely used prediction score is the 'pneumonia severity index' (PSI), which stratifies the patients to five risk categories; the higher the score, the higher the risk of death . The PSI categorizes those that can be safely managed as outpatients, those that require a short period of observation in the emergency department, and those that should be hospitalized, considering the presence of severe CAP markers. An easy-to-use version of the PSI is available on the internet (see Relevant Websites). An alternative score used at the bedside is the CURB 65 (Lim et al., 2003) .",

Additionally, the rates of S. pneumoniae macrolide resistance have risen substantially in several parts of the world, contributing to an increased risk of macrolide treatment failure (Daneman et al., 2006) . It is therefore prudent to treat these patients with a respiratory fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, gatifloxacin) or b-lactam (amoxicillin 1 g tid or amoxicillin/clavulanate 2g bid or ceftriaxone) plus a macrolide in regions with recognized high-resistance rates. In non-ICU inpatients the following treatment options are recommended: a respiratory fluoroquinolone or b-lactam plus macrolide.
