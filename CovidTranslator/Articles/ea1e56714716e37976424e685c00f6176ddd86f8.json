Consistent with the affect literature, we first predict that prior outcomes will yield more optimistic expectations when the outcomes are positively, rather than negatively, valenced. We then predict that the impact of prior outcomes will depend on not only the valence, but also the domain of prior outcomes. Specifically, we draw from Prospect theory to predict that the impact of prior outcomes on future expectations will be greater in the domain of losses than in the domain of gains. Two lottery-based experiments demonstrate that this effect is robust across different starting and ending wealth states, and a third experiment shows that these differences in expectations also translate into differences in risk preferences.",

            "text": "As Tversky and Fox (1995) observe, decisions are frequently made without definite knowledge of their consequences. The decisions to invest in a stock, submit a paper to a journal, or take a particular route home from work are all rife with uncertainty. But, decision-makers generally have a subjective probability estimate or an expectation regarding the likelihood of success or failure (Wright & Bower, 1992) . These expectations may be based on a variety of factors including one's prior experience with similar endeavors. Prior successes or failures in investing will likely yield expectations regarding the success of future investing, and prior experiences with journal submissions will yield expectations regarding success at publishing. But when the past is not a reliable indicator of the future because past and future events are unrelated, how are expectations of the future formed? It is this issue of how expectations about a future outcome might be influenced by unrelated prior outcomes that we examine. We demonstrate that randomly generated prior outcomes that ought not to influence perceptions about a future event still do so because of the positive or negative feelings that the prior outcomes evoke. 2 We draw from the literature on affect (Isen, 1970; Wright & Bower, 1992; Wright & Mischel, 1982) to argue that prior (unrelated) outcomes will yield more optimistic expectations when the outcome valence is positive rather than negative. Further, based on Prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) , we make the relatively nuanced claim that this effect of outcome valence is contingent on the domain in which the prior outcome occurs (i.e., gains vs. losses). Because of loss aversion, we predict that the affect induced will be stronger when the prior outcomes are in the domain of losses rather than in the domain of gains. This domain-based asymmetry in affect then translates to a domain-based asymmetry in expectations as well. In two lottery-based experiments employing real money, we observe this effect of changes in expectations being mediated by the affect induced by the prior outcomes. We also find that this effect is robust across different starting and ending wealth states. In a third study, we show how this domain-based asymmetry for expectations influences risky choice. Employing a modified Asian disease problem (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981) , we show that risk preferences are more strongly influenced when prior outcomes are in the domain of losses rather than gains.",

For instance, the ''hot hand'' literature (Gilovich, Vallone, & Tversky, 1985) suggests that people expect a streak of outcomes to continue in the future, whereas the ''gambler's fallacy'' perspective (Tversky & Kahneman, 1971) suggests that people expect a streak to reverse itself, even though the events are independent of each other. We add to this research stream by implicating the role that affect induced by prior outcomes plays in biasing expectations of the future. The mechanism we invoke is subtly different from extant explanations because the affect evoked, and hence the bias about future expectations, depends not only on the valence of prior outcomes, but also on the domain in which it occurs.",

First, as has been demonstrated by Tversky and Kahneman (1981) , when faced with two alternative programs that can help combat a rare Asian disease, more people choose the riskier option when the outcomes associated with each of the programs are framed as losses (i.e., numbers of deaths) but more people choose the risk-averse program when the outcomes are framed as gains (i.e., numbers of lives saved). While this earlier research studies the effect of the domain in which the focal event occurs, our research studies the effect of the domain (and valence) of prior events. Drawing upon the role of affect that drives the predicted domain-based asymmetry for expectations about the future, we show that risk preferences are influenced by the valence of prior outcomes substantially more so when the prior outcomes are in the domain of losses rather than in gains. Second, Thaler and Johnson (1990) found that the effect of prior outcomes on risk preferences may depend on the ability of decision-makers to integrate prior outcomes with the potential payoffs offered by current choices (e.g., prior losses may increase the selection of risky options if there is an opportunity to ''break-even''). Because our proposed effects are predicated on the affect evoked by prior outcomes, we show that prior outcomes influence risk preferences even when prior and future events are in different mental accounts and there are no opportunities for the integration of outcomes.",

Recently, Loewenstein, Weber, Hsee, and Welch (2001) have distinguished between two types of emotion: anticipatory emotions (e.g., fear), which are immediate and visceral, and anticipated emotions (e.g., regret), which are expected to be experienced in the future (pp. 267-268). As Loewenstein et al. (2001) observe, the bulk of the literature views affect as an anticipated emotion. Our approach implicitly invokes an anticipatory perspective on affect. We suggest that expectations are driven by the affect (induced by prior outcomes) that people are experiencing at the time they are judging expectations. Drawing on Schwarz and Clore's (1983) affectas-information model, one can postulate a direct effect of affect according to which people who have recently experienced a positive (vs. negative) event might be more optimistic about a future event because they misattribute their positive feelings to the future event. Affect might also influence judgments indirectly by creating a ''warm glow'' (Isen, 1970) , which in turn makes moodconsistent information relatively more available, accessible, salient, memorable, and retrievable (Isen, Shalker, Clark, & Karp, 1978; Wright & Mischel, 1982) . Therefore, a person who has experienced favorable outcomes that lead to positive affect may, when asked to predict the outcome of a future event, predict a favorable (positive) outcome because the current positive mood makes positive outcomes more available in memory.",

Similarly, Brown (1984) found that participants in a negative affective state had lower expectations than those in a positive state, when making predictions about success at a concept formation problem. Further, Wright and Bower (1992) demonstrated that inducing affect (through an imagination exercise coupled with hypnosis) had the expected effect on subjective probability assessments of future events that were either personal or non-personal in nature. These results provide strong support for mood congruent effects on optimism and pessimism. Happy people tend to have a much rosier view of the future relative to unhappy people.",

Each of these outcomes has affect associated with it-positive for the favorable outcome cells A and C, and negative for the unfavorable outcome cells B and D. 4 Our question revolves around whether the valence of prior outcomes (positive vs. negative) influences expectations differently depending on whether those outcomes occur in the domain of losses or gains.",

            "text": "Prospect theory's value function (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) is a convenient device to analyze the outcomes in Table 1 . Loss aversion, a core tenet of prospect theory, suggests that losses dominate gains (a premise captured by the relatively steep slope of the value function in the domain of losses resulting in outcomes in the domain of losses yielding a stronger effect on value perceptions than outcomes in the domain of gains). In other words, ''the aggravation that one experiences in losing a sum of money appears to be greater than the pleasure associated with gaining the same amount'' (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979, p. 279) . 5 Put differently, the aggravation associated with the outright loss of a sum of money ought to be greater than that associated with the opportunity loss of not being able to gain the same amount. That is, a movement away from the origin in the domain of losses yields a relatively large change in value perceptions, while an equivalent movement towards the origin in the domain of gains yields a relatively small change in value perceptions (Nagle & Holden, 2002; Thaler, 1980) . This view of opportunity costs is consistent with the perspective that ''. . . out-of-pocket costs are viewed as losses and opportunity costs are viewed as foregone gains, (thus) the former will be more heavily weighted'' 3 One reviewer astutely noted the connection between the concept of base-rates and the concept of domains. Base-rates refer to initial probabilities of the domain outcomes. If one player's base-rate of hitting a basketball shot is 90% and another player's is 50%, the former is likely to feel worse in the event of a missed shot. However, in either case, the domain of the outcomes is gains. The two possible outcomes are gain (i.e., addition to the score) and non-gain (i.e., failure to make an addition to the score). 4 This classification is similar to the classification scheme used in regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1998) to distinguish between promotion (gains, non-gains) and prevention (losses, non-losses). The domains of gain and loss also bear resemblance to the concepts of benefit and burden used in the literature on resource allocation (Mannix, Neale, & Northcraft, 1995) . In the interest of brevity, we do not discuss these other perspectives further. 5 While value and affect are conceptually distinct constructs, our argument is premised on a positive relationship between the two, as a result of which people feel better about an outcome when the value of the outcome is higher. This thinking is consistent with that of Kahneman and Tversky (1979) who used affectively laden terms such as ''aggravation'' and ''pleasure'' to describe the asymmetry in the slope of the value function in the domains of losses versus gains. Moreover, the affective implications of the prospect theory value function have been explored by other research as well. For example, Coughlan and Connolly (2001) studied affective responses to unexpected outcomes and found that losses loom larger than gains. An outcome below expectations generated more (negative) affect than the (positive) affect generated by an outcome that exceeded expectations by the same amount. (Thaler, 1980, p. 44) . Additionally, Northcraft and Neale (1986) note that opportunity costs are relatively abstract and therefore less salient, in comparison to outright losses.",

Since the loss portion of the slope is steeper, for economically equivalent values, the difference in affect between cells C and D should be greater than that in affect between cells A and B. Therefore, we suggest a domain-contingent asymmetry for affect. Moreover, because of the link between affect and expectations (as discussed during our development of Hypothesis 1), we should find a similar domain-contingent asymmetry for expectations about future events. This leads to our second hypothesis, according to which the intensity of the effect predicted in Hypothesis 1 will depend on the domain of prior outcomes.",

Participants were told that they would play three lotteries and that their chance of winning a lottery was 50% since there were only two possible outcomes for each lottery. They then received a randomly assigned questionnaire that indicated the letter they were playing for. For one-half of the participants, the winning letter was ''A'' for the first lottery and ''B'' for the second lottery. For the other half, the winning letter was ''B'' for the first lottery and ''A'' for the second lottery. For each lottery, a randomly selected subject drew a card from an envelope that purportedly had an ''A'' card and a ''B'' card, and read the letter aloud so that the rest of the participants knew what it was. A subject would win the lottery if his/her letter matched the one drawn. This procedure was repeated for the second lottery. The outcomes were surreptitiously controlled such that only an ''A'' could be drawn in the first draw and only a ''B'' could be drawn in the second draw. Thus, half the participants (the A followed by B participants) won twice, while half the participants (the B followed by A participants) lost twice.

An ANOVA was run on the composite dependent variable with valence of prior outcome (negative vs. positive) and domain (losses vs. gains) as independent variables. Consistent with Hypothesis 1, there was a main effect for valence of prior outcome. Participants who had won the first two lotteries felt that their likelihood of winning the third was significantly higher than participants who had lost the first two lotteries (M = 5.53 vs. 3.94; F (1,66) = 14.09; g 2 p =.18; p < .001). There was no observed main effect of domain. In addition, as predicted in Hypothesis 2, there was a significant valence \u00b7 domain interaction on expectations of winning the third lottery (F (1,66) = 5.91; g 2 p = .08; p < .05). The pattern of the interaction is displayed in Fig. 1 To test the mediating role of affect (Hypothesis 3), two independent judges coded participants' thoughts leading to their responses to the two focal questions (i.e., chance of winning and confidence of winning). The judges were given basic information about the study, but were blind to the conditions the participants were in. They were asked to indicate whether, in terms of affect, a participant's response was negative, positive, or neutral. A negative response was defined as one in which the participant had written that his/her responses to the expectation questions were based on some negative feelings (e.g., ''I was sad because I didn't win either lottery.'') A positive response was defined as one in which the participant had written that his/her responses to the expectation questions were based on some positive feelings (e.g., ''I have won the two lotteries in the beginning, so that makes me feel pretty good about winning.''). A neutral response was defined as one in which the participant did not indicate any positive or negative feelings as the basis for his/her response (e.g., ''My chance is still 50% because there are only two options.''). 6 Subjects were undergraduate Business-school students who completed a mandatory research requirement by participating in this study; they were not required to participate in any more studies during their academic careers. Hence, there likely are no concerns that our procedure contaminated these subjects for future researchers who might employ real money gambles as their stimuli. 7 The significant 2-way interaction and the stronger effect in the domain of losses versus gains are supportive of our predictions. However, based on the recommendations of an anonymous reviewer, we conducted further contrast analyses. First, in order to determine whether the negative-valence-losses-domain cell was exerting a disproportionately strong effect on the dependent variable, a weight of \u00c03 was given to this cell and a weight of +1 was given to each of the other three cells. We found that the contrast was significant (F (1,66) = 15.68; p < .01). Next, to determine whether the results are indeed due to an enhancement of prior outcome effects in the domain of losses, a weight of \u00c03 was given to the negative-valence-losses-domain cell, a weight of +3 was given to the positive-valence-loss-domain cell, a weight of \u00c01 was given to the negative-valence-gains-domain cell, and a weight of +1 was given to the positive-valence-gains-domain cell. We found that the contrast was significant (F (1,66) = 20.22; p < .001). Finally, in order to assess whether the results are driven only by the two negatively valenced cells, a weight of \u00c01 was given to the negatively valencedlosses-domain cell and a weight of +1 was given to the negatively valenced-gains-domain cell, while the other two cells were given a weight of zero. Here again, we found that the contrast was significant (F (1,66) = 4.61; p < .05).",

Using regression analyses we observed that the effects of both valence and the valence \u00b7 domain interaction on the expectation regarding the future event were mediated by affect. When the mediator (affect) was used as the dependent variable, valence was significant (b = .41; t 66 = 4.11; p < .001), as was the valence \u00b7 domain interaction (b = \u00c0.33; t 66 = \u00c03.32; p < .01). When expectation was used as the dependent variable, we again observed a significant effect of valence (b = .40; t 66 = 3.80; p < .001) as well as the valence \u00b7 domain interaction (b = \u00c0.26; t 66 = \u00c02.43; p < .05).

The results were similar to those that were obtained in Experiment 1, providing evidence that the earlier results were robust.

The results of two real money lotteries are supportive of our hypotheses. In a third study, we examine whether these differential expectations will translate into differences in preferences in risky choice settings.

(2001) discuss the influence of anticipated and anticipatory affect on judgment and decision-making. For instance, people might anticipate the affect they would experience following the outcome of a risky choice, and choose the option that they believe will make them feel better (Mellers, Schwartz, Ho, & Ritov, 1997) . Similarly, as an anticipatory emotion, people might employ their current affect as a heuristic to make judgments (Finucane, Alhakami, Slovic, & Johnson, 2000) . Our findings are situated more in the anticipatory tradition. We suggest that the anticipatory affect evoked by prior outcomes varies with the domain of prior outcomes and influences expectations about the future to a greater degree in the domain of losses than in the domain of gains.",

This presumably happens because people feel they can integrate future outcomes with prior gains and losses (e.g., compensate earlier losses with the new outcome). By using different mental accounts (money and lives), we demonstrate that prior outcomes can influence decision-making even when no opportunity for integration exists. Our results suggest that the decision to choose a risky option depends not only on whether the outcome can be integrated with earlier gains or losses, but also on expectations about whether the risky option will pan out. If expectations indeed change based on prior outcomes (as we demonstrate), so should risk preferences. Preference for a risky option is going to be lower (relative to a risk-free option) if one becomes more pessimistic about the outcome. We demonstrate that preference for a risky option reduces when prior outcomes are negative rather than positive in the domain of losses.",

Another stream suggests that happy endings are preferred even when the event may not be expected to occur (Chen & Rao, 2002) ; initial outcomes may shift the psychological reference point, making happy events relatively more enjoyable if they occur later, rather than earlier, in a series. Our research is consistent with this latter perspective. Recently experienced unfavorable events may lower expectations and depress the reference point. Consequently, when a favorable outcome occurs in the future, it may be even more enjoyable than if it had not been preceded by an unfavorable event.

This might reduce her willingness to pay for an extended warranty. Additionally, the frame in which the prior outcomes occurred would likely impact expectations of failure.

The current research suggests that this impact of prior events could occur even when prior and future events are unrelated, and more so in the domain of losses rather than gains. Public policy officials may be interested in influencing the subjective expectations and resulting risk taking behavior of at-risk populations that engage in excessive gambling, drinking and driving, unsafe sex, sharing potentially contaminated needles, and the like. In general, these populations' risk perceptions are affected by a variety of factors including the number of occasions on which they or their friends engage in risky behavior with favorable or unfavorable consequences. Since the unfavorable outcomes (such as death or disease) are rarer than favorable outcomes (the status quo), most members of at-risk populations likely underestimate the probability of unfavorable outcomes. Therefore, the challenge for public policy officials is to generate a pessimism bias among this population by making prior unfavorable outcomes more salient.",
