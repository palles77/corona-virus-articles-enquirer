Clinically, acute respiratory infection is the primary performance of MERS, accompanying with high fever (even reach to 39e40 C), and sometimes with chills, shiver, cough, chest pain, headache, muscle and joint aches, fatigue, loss of appetite and so on. On the basis of pneumonia, the MERS rapidly developed into respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or acute renal failure. Diarrhea and other atypical clinical manifestations might occur to individual cases (such as immunodeficiency cases). In this study, the patient suffered from fever (up to 39.5 C) and back pain firstly. After hospitalization for one week, his body temperature returned to normal (Fig. 2) , but still being in cough with a small amount of yellow phlegm and a little bloodshot; and there is no shortness of breath at rest and oxygen therapy. On the sixth day after his hospitalization, MERS-COV was negative via the virological detection of sputum, and his body temperature had decreased to be normal, which indicated that the virus has a direct relationship with the fever. Laboratory tests found that the leukocytes count in the peripheral blood had decreased obviously since his hospitalization, and the count was about 3.00 \u00c2 10 9 /L lasting for nine days, followed by increasing and till the 27th days it recovered to the normal level. This indicated that MERS-CoV mainly attacked human immune system, resulting in a significant reduce of leukocytes count; after the virus was cleared, the recovery may be a relatively slow process due to the leukocytes count recovered to the normal range for about two weeks after the virus return to be negative.",

Via High-resolution CT scans, septal thickening and bronchiectasis could be both observed. However, ground glass opacities and consolidation of SARS were relatively mild, with the lesions of a migratory change [9e11]. As for MERS and H7N9 avian influenza, their common characteristics were ground glass shadows and pulmonary opacities in both lower lung lobes, except for that disease progression of H7N9 avian influenza infection might be more rapid [10, 11] . Summarily, differential imaging diagnosis on the basis of epidemiological and experimental pathogen detection is helpful for clinical diagnosis of MERS, even in distinguishing from SARS or pneumonia caused by H7N9 avian influenza.",
