Establishment of an efficient and sensitive diagnostic system of SARS-CoV genetic materials is crucial for SARS control. In this study, we quantified SARS-CoV mRNAs in both infected cell culture lysate and in supernatant by using Real-time quantitative revere transcription-PCR based on EvaGreen TM dye and Taqman-MGB probes. For extensive evaluation of sensitivities and specificities, 13 pairs of primers and 4 probes were designed based on different genes of SARS-CoV. Glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was selected as the internal control gene. Results showed that S-gene-specific PCR was the most sensitive for detection, but because of its sequence variability in the different viral strains, primers and a probe based on the N gene were suitable substitutions. Meanwhile, we found the mRNA concentrations in cell culture lysates were much higher than in cell supernatant and facilited more sensitive detection of the SARS-CoV.",

To date, three types of diagnostic tests were developed: propagation of the virus in tissue culture, detection by antisera, and reverse transcription-PCR assays. However, virus propagation in tissue culture is relatively time consuming, requires special expertise and rather extensive facilities, since SARS-CoV is a biosafety level 3 pathogen. Serology has been proven to be sensitive but may require up to 20 d for serologic conversion (9) . Therefore, RT-PCR, especially Realtime quantitative RT-PCR, which is fast and convenient for detection of SARS-CoV, has widely become the method of choice for virus detection.",

A Taqman amplicon targeting the N gene is 5 log10 times more sensitive for SARS-CoV target RNA extracted from infected cells and 2.79 log10 times more sensitive for RNA extracted from patient material than an amplicon targeting the polymerase gene (11) . These data suggested that detection based on the N gene is more sensitive than detection based on the Replicase 1b gene, but the efficiency and sensitivity of detection based on other genes of SARS-CoV have never been reported.

The data demonstrated that the results were reproducible with a mean coefficient of variation (CV) in the logarithm values of copy numbers of less than 10% (range, 1.38 to 9.29%) ( Table 5 and Table 6 ). The results are shown as the mean N = mean starting copy number of target gene / mean starting copy number of reference gene GAPDH. The quantification results indicated that the sensitivities and specificities of different gene-specific primer pairs and probes of SARS-CoV were quite different from each other, and provided clues for optimized molecular detection of SARS-CoV. From our results, primers and a probe based on the S gene, especially the S 1 primers, were most sensitive and efficient, and may be used for diagnosis in specimens obtained during the early infection phase. In practice, we had to accept the fact that the S gene sequence was not conserved among the different strains and was prone to mutation. This caused us much concern in using the primers and probe based on the S gene despite having the best sensitivity for detection. Therefore, people opted to choose primers and probes based on conserved genes, such as N or Replicase 1b (1, 3, 4, 6, 11) . From our result and five other independent laboratories (1, 3, 4, 6, 11) , the N gene was more sensitive than the Replicase 1b both in cell culture and patient materials, which makes it suitable for molecular detection of SARS-CoV.",

At the same time, we amplified part of the GAPDH gene from HeLa cells (based on Homo sapiens GAPDH sequence with GenBank accession number AF261085) to produce a standard sample for GAPDH quantification. PCR products of GAPDH and twelve genes of SARS-CoV were cloned into the pGEM-T easy vector (Promega) and positive clones which oriented under the control of the T7 promoter were selected. Each plasmid DNA was amplified by PCR using M13 forward and SP6 primers for linearization and purified by phenolchloroform extraction and isopropyl alcohol precipitation to provide templates for RNA transcription. The RNA transcript of each gene was synthesized in vitro by using RiboMAX Large Scale RNA Production System-T7 (Promega), according to the manu-facturer's protocols. DNA was removed by RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega) and the final standard RNA was purified by RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN).",

At the same time, GAPDH was selected as the reference gene to normalize the amounts of input RNAs and allowed direct comparison of the results obtained from different specimens. We found the mRNA concentrations in cell culture lysates to be ten fold higher than in cell supernatants. This may have been caused by large amounts of unpackaged mRNAs in cell cultures that lack the signals to package the RNA into the mature virions and consequently release it into cell supernatants. However, when using S primers and probe, the normalized gene dose N values were highest in both cell lysates and supernatants, which were nearly ten times of that detected by 3a and 3b primers and hundred times of the values for the E, M, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and N genes. The N values detected by Replicase 1b primers and probe were lowest, about one tenth of that detected by N primers and probe both in cell lysates and supernatants, This suggests that the Rep-licase 1b was not a suitable candidate gene for SARS-CoV diagnostic detection and the S gene was the best.",
