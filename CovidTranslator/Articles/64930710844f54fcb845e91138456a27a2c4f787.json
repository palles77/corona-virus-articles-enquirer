The genus respirovirus includes PIV types 1 and 3 and the genus rubulavirus includes PIV types 2 and 4 10 . PIV 1 and 2 are leading causes of LTB in children, while PIV 3 is more frequently associated with LRTIs including bronchiolitis and pneumonia 10, 11 . The seasonal patterns of human PIV infections differ according to the virus type with PIV 3 most prevalent in the late spring and summer, and PIVs 1 and 2 occurring most commonly in the late fall and early winter. Outbreaks of PIV 2 infections usually follow PIV 1 outbreaks. PIV 3 infections continue throughout the year, primarily in the spring and summer, while PIV 4 is isolated infrequently 1, 2, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Seroepidemiologic studies indicate that approximately half of US children older than one year, and nearly all of those over five years of age have been infected with PIV 3. Antibodies against PIV 1 and 2 develop somewhat later, with 50-74% of children demonstrating seropositivity by age five years. Although infections are less commonly identified by culture, between 70 and 90% of young adults are seropositive for PIV 4 2, 10, 12 .",

The initial host response to infection is dictated by events occurring within the infected respiratory epithelial cells. Proinflammatory mediators released from infected cells direct the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the site of infection and contribute to the clinical manifestations of disease. We have previously demonstrated that the epithelial cell line HEp-2 and explanted human bronchial epithelial cells respond to PIV infection with the production and release of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL3 (macrophage inflammatory protein 1-\u03b1) and CXCL8 (interleukin-8) 17 . Interestingly, while local production of proinflammatory mediators in response to RSV infection have been documented extensively [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , there are no analogous published studies evaluating inflammation in response to PIV.",

Children were included in the present study if they were evaluated for a suspected acute respiratory viral infection, had a nasal wash sample collected between 1998-2008, were culture positive for PIV from that nasal wash sample, and had residual nasal wash sample available for further characterization. We identified 165 such patients. Chart review was performed to collect patient information including demographics, details regarding clinical presentation, information as to whether or not the patient was hospitalized, and if so, details regarding the hospital course. Three categories of illness severity were used for the purposes of this study; mild, moderate and severe. Mild disease was defined as an illness not requiring hospitalization. Moderate disease was any illness requiring hospitalization, but not requiring administration of supplemental oxygen, and severe disease was defined as any illness requiring hospitalization and treatment with supplemental oxygen and/or admission to the pediatric intensive care unit. In addition, after obtaining informed consent, nasal wash samples from 79 asymptomatic children between the ages of two weeks and 4 years were obtained for use as controls. The age and gender distribution for the control group was similar to the research subjects with 55 children under the age of one year, and 15 children between the age of one and four years. Forty-four of the control subjects were males.",

Sixty-one (40%) patients were treated as outpatients (mild illness), while 92 (60%) patients were hospitalized for a median length of stay of 3 days. In the hospitalized group, 43 (28%) met our definition of severe illness. When we evaluated presenting symptoms and illness severity according to PIV type or PIV genus (respiroviruses or rubulaviruses), PIV type did not predict disease severity, however we found that supplemental oxygen treatment was more likely to be given to patients with respirovirus infection when compared to those with rubulavirus infection (p<0.05). We were surprised to find that gastrointestinal symptoms were also more commonly reported in those patients with respirovirus infection. Of the 125 (82%) patients who had a chest radiograph performed, 74 (59%) had abnormalities identified by the radiologist including infiltrates, consolidation or effacement of the cardiac border.

Thirty-two of thirty-seven (86%) cases of bronchiolitis occurred during infection with respiroviruses, while 21 of the 30 (70%) cases of pneumonia were caused by PIV 3.

The median age of our cohort was six months, and 59% were males. The seasonal distribution of the infections showed two peaks, one in the spring from PIVs 1 and 3, and another in the fall from PIV 1. As expected, PIV 3 was the most common virus type isolated, while PIV 4 infections were not commonly documented. Almost all patients had some respiratory symptoms, the majority had fever, and a large proportion also had documented vomiting, diarrhea, and/or abdominal pain (54/153) 30 . Forty percent of the patients included in the study were treated as outpatients. Of those hospitalized, 47% required oxygen and/or ICU admission. There were two deaths, one with PIV 1 and one with PIV 2. We found that respiroviruses (PIV 1 and 3) were more likely to cause lower respiratory tract infections when compared to rubulaviruses (PIV 2 and 4), and PIV associated pneumonia was most common with PIV 3, consistent with our observation that supplemental oxygen was more commonly used in the respirovirus group. PIV 1 and 2 infections accounted for 20 of 21 cases of LTB (95%). In our cohort, 31% of the patients infected with PIV 2 required admission to the intensive care unit. Nearly half of the children included in our study received antibiotic therapy either in the emergency department or during their hospitalization, although none of them had a documented bacterial infection. This is the first published study to present a systematic evaluation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile from PIV-infected children and to examine this in relation to disease severity. Compared to healthy subjects, PIV-infected children produce and release a profile of pro-inflammatory cytokines into their airway including IL-6, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CXCL8 and CXCL9. Most of the published literature in the area of virus induced chemokine expression, and localized innate immune responses during acute respiratory viral infection has focused on cytokine profiles obtained form RSV-infected children. These studies have shown that CCL2, CCL3, CCL5 and CXCL8 concentrations each correlated with RSV disease severity [24] [25] [26] 28 . Among these reports, Henrickson and colleagues showed that higher concentrations of IL-6, CXCL8 and IFN-\u03b3 were detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from wheezing children with RSV and influenza A infections, but CXCL8 concentrations did not correlate with illness severity 6 . Gern and colleagues evaluated nasal wash samples from infants with acute viral infections and found elevated levels of CXCL8 from infants with RSV, parainfluenza and rhinovirus infections, but did not find a significant correlation between nasal CXCL8 concentrations and symptom scores; of note PIV virus typing and disease severity were not evaluated independently 31 .",

First, CXCL8 concentrations were higher in the nasal wash samples from PIV-infected patients compared to the control, uninfected patients. In addition, we noted that CXCL8 concentrations were higher in patients with LRTI when compared to URI, and in patients with moderate and severe illness compared to mild illness. When we stratified our patients by disease severity, we found a significant difference in CXCL8 concentrations in severe cases when compared to non-severe cases. The mechanism(s) by which PIV induces host CXCL8 production and release in vivo is not known, however PIV 4 has been shown to enhance CXCL8 release from airway epithelial cells (NCI-H292) via both transcriptional and post transcriptional means 36 .",

Specifically, reducing CXCL8 (and other chemokine) production via glucocorticoid administration may result in diminished recruitment of proinflammatory leukocytes resulting in a diminished inflammatory response with symptom amelioration.
