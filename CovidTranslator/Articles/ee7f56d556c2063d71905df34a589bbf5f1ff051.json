Our results indicated that substantial reductions in the epidemic growth rate (from more than 0.1 per day to well under 0.1 per day) and epidemic doubling time (from approximately 6 days to perhaps more than 14 days) are feasible if the diagnosis delay is short (<3 days) and a high proportion of non-household contacts are traced and isolated (>70%).",

            "text": "As of early March 2020, the number of infections of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is still increasing at an almost exponential rate, while the virus is rapidly expanding its range in all parts of the world. There are no registered effective medicines, treatment options are mainly supportive, and there are no vaccines available, limiting preventive measures mainly to isolation of infected persons and those that have high likelihood of being infected, for instance because they have been traced as contacts of infected persons. 1 To what extent local containment or local slowing down of an early epidemic is successful depends on the effectiveness of case isolation and contact tracing. It is known that a high probability of asymptomatic infection, a high proportion of transmission occurring before the onset of symptoms, a long delay between case finding and isolation, and high overall transmissibility all factor in negatively in the likelihood that an outbreak can be contained. [2] [3] [4] [5] For SARS-CoV-2, evidence indicates that a high fraction of infected persons is infectious before they show symptoms (up to 50%), that a substantial fraction of infections may be asymptomatic or show only mild symptoms, and that the epidemic doubling time in the absence of interventions is approximately one week. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Here we provide model-based analyses of the impact of isolation and contact tracing, using varying levels of the effectiveness of contact tracing and varying delays in diagnosis, isolation, and contact tracing. We focus on conditions that make containment of an early epidemic possible, but also on the impact of isolation and contact tracing when containment is not possible. In the latter case we report the (exponential) rate of increase and the doubling time of the epidemic for scenarios without and with interventions. Considering that the capacity of healthcare systems is limited, it is important to assess which interventions are most effective in slowing down the rate of increase of healthcare demand during an ongoing outbreak. As it is likely that isolation and contact tracing will be more effective in close contact settings with well-defined contacts (household, workplace) than in the community (commuting, public spaces), while the potential impact of household interventions on the epidemic could be smaller, we stratify the analyses by transmission settings (henceforth called household and non-household). 4 As many of the relevant epidemiological and intervention parameters are still quite uncertain, or may be variable in different settings, we focus throughout on a systematic analysis of the relation between key parameters for timeliness and completeness of contact tracing and main outcomes such as effective reproduction number and epidemic growth rate.",

Starting from a small set of initially infected individuals, the model calculates the numbers of latently infected persons, infectious persons, and persons that are diagnosed and isolated in time steps of one day. Latent infection, infectivity during the infectious period, and daily contact rates are quantified using distributions taken from published literature ( Table 1) . We distinguish between household contacts and non-household contacts, which differ in the risk of infection and the delay and effectiveness of tracing and isolation. Intervention effectiveness is determined by the daily probability of being diagnosed during the infectious period, which can differ between cases occurring before the first diagnosis has taken place, and later cases (Table 2) . Furthermore, intervention effectiveness depends on the delays in tracing household and non-household contacts, respectively, and which proportions of contacts can be found and isolated. We assume that isolation is perfect, i.e. that isolated persons cannot transmit any longer. The model is described by a set of difference equations, and allows for explicit computation of the basic reproduction number R0 and the effective reproduction number under interventions Re . The model was coded in Mathematica 11.2.",

In that case, 39% of transmissions take place among household contacts. The basic reproduction number of household contacts is 0.97, that of non-household contacts 1.53. So, if all non-household transmissions could be prevented, the outbreak would be just under the control limit. In the baseline scenario without interventions the exponential growth rate is 0.127 per day and the doubling time is 5.5 days, which seem reasonable. 11 In Figure 2 we show how basic and effective reproduction number are related. We explore how varying the fraction of non-household contacts that are traced, and the time to diagnosis of index cases influence the effective reproduction number. In the first case, we observe that failure to find all infected contacts does not lead to a loss of control for R0=2.5 or lower (Figure 2a) . This is only due to the optimistic values of all other parameters, in particular that cases will be diagnosed and isolated without delay as soon as they become symptomatic. If there is delay in diagnosis, loss of control will occur for delays above 1 week, even if all non-household contacts can be found and isolated (Figure 2b ). Contacts have then already entered the infectious period and have had time to spread the infection. So we conclude that timeliness of diagnosis is of utmost importance for controlling an outbreak.",

We therefore computed the minimum fraction of nonhousehold contacts that need to be traced and isolated (henceforth termed \"critical tracing coverage\") to bring Re to below 1. The results are shown in Figures 3a and 3b . For a diagnosis delay up to 4 days, there is a chance of controlling the outbreak if the coverage of tracing non-household contacts is above the critical fraction (Figure 3a ). In Figure 3b , we varied the time it takes to trace non-household contacts between 1 and 7 days, assuming no diagnosis delay. In this case, the time needed to trace contacts does not have a large impact on the critical tracing coverage.

The vertical green line depicts the baseline value of R0=2.5. Blue shows the critical tracing coverage in the optimistic baseline scenario, pink the worst case scenario. In panels A, C, and E, the delay in diagnosis was varied between 1 and 10 days in steps of 1 day; in the panels B, D, and F, the time needed to trace non-household contacts was varied between 1 and 7 days in steps of 1 day. The rows differ in the fraction of asymptomatic infections: 100% symptomatic (A and B), 80% symptomatic (C and D), and 60% symptomatic (E and F). Figure 4 : The critical tracing coverage needed for control of the outbreak for varying percentages of asymptomatic infections and values of R0 between 1.5 and 3.5. If more than 40% of cases escape diagnosis because they are asymptomatic or have only mild infections, for R0 = 2.5 the outbreak is not controllable even with our optimistic baseline values for the intervention parameters. Figure 5 : The exponential growth rate for (A) varying delay in diagnosis and (C) varying tracing coverage. The colors depict varying levels of symptomatic infections: Blue: 100% symptomatic cases; Pink: 2% symptomatic cases. When the exponential growth rate is smaller than zero (red horizontal line), the outbreak is controlled. In (B) and (D), the doubling time of the epidemic is shown for situations where the exponential growth rate is positive. In (B) delay in diagnosis is varied and in (D) tracing coverage is varied. The uppermost curve corresponds to a situation with 60% symptomatic cases, the lowest one to 2% symptomatic cases. For the situation with 60% asymptomatic cases, contact tracing and isolation can slow down the epidemic substantially, but not control it, even if there is no diagnosis delay and all non-household contacts are traced.",
