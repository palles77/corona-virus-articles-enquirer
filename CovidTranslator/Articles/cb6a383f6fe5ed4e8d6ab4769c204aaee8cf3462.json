            "text": "In brief, evolution is a process of heritable change in the phenotype of a population of organisms (Box 1). While evolution can result from random genetic drift (representing \"neutral\" evolution), here we focus on adaptive evolution, defined as a change in population mean fitness in response to natural selection (Box 1). Genetic and trait variation, and how such variation changes over time and space, are fundamental properties of living systems. There is mounting evidence that evolution is sufficiently fast in natural populations to be highly relevant for understanding how J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f application is still limited (J\u00f8rgensen et al., 2019) . In the context of the biodiversity crisis ecologists are increasingly using evolutionary theory to help mitigate the loss of genetic and species diversity due to climate change and environmental pollution (Bell & Gonzalez, 2009; Kristensen et al., 2018) . Evolutionary theory is also critical to understanding the emergence of antibiotic resistance in microbes (Palmer & Kishony, 2013) and chemical resistance in pests (Fisher et al., 2018) . Plainly, evolutionary theory can be highly relevant to pertinent environmental problems, but it is not broadly applied. There is a frequent use of methods and technologies originating from evolutionary biology. In particular, molecular genetic methods are often used to characterise microbial community composition (Das & Dash, 2019) , and the patterns of gene expression of individual organisms and communities (Oziolor et al., 2017) . While such methods are undeniably useful to gain functional insights, they are rarely used in environmental science to study evolutionary processes. The potential for evolutionary applications in environmental sciences is far reaching, and in the next sections we focus on core concepts of evolution and exemplify how they can be applied to a range of environmental problems in aquatic ecosystems.",

Evolutionary novelty can also emerge in populations exposed to synthetic environments created by humans, and, in doing so, perform essential evosystem services (Rudman et al., 2017) . For example, the artificial sweetener acesulfame (ACE) is a persistent compound in aquatic environments because it is resistant to microbial-mediated biodegradation both in natural and wastewater treatment environments (Kahl et al., 2018) . Recent work suggests that the catabolism of this compound has evolved repeatedly in multiple wastewater treatment plants in Germany (Kahl et al., 2018) , possibly associated with a microbial consortium of proteobacterial species (Figure 1 ). Identifying the evolutionary processes governing such bioremediation dynamics could help address the persistence of chemicals in our natural environments for which engineering solutions are lacking. On the other hand, evolutionary processes can also create novel environmental problems, or worsen existing ones. For example, the emergence and amplification of antibiotic resistance genes is a global problem, caused by the widespread overuse of antibiotics (Palmer & Kishony, 2013) . In wastewater treatment plants, the concentration of antibiotic resistance genes may be amplified by evolution prior to water discharge into natural aquatic environments (Ju et al. ",

Disease outbreaks are often caused by pathogens that have undergone a recent host shift or expansion of their geographic range (Engering et al. 2013; Longdon et al. 2014) . Most disease-causing organisms have large populations and short generation times, which generally facilitates rapid evolution. Consequently, disease emergence typically involves rapid co-evolutionary dynamics that stem from natural selection on both pathogen infectivity and host defence (Penczykowski et al. 2016) . Rapid evolutionary dynamics are expected to take place at the onset of disease emergence, governed by the pathogens' and the hosts' evolutionary history.",

Until now, algal biomass production for biofuel has heavily focused on the production of single species with desirable properties, namely high lipid content, fast growth rates, and resistance to disease and grazers.

Chemical pollution often stems from chemical pest control applied in agricultural production, as well as from the unwanted waste produced by human population growth and industrial activities. Wastewater treatment plants can only remove and target compounds that pass through the sewage system; many other compounds still enter the natural environment in a diffuse manner, especially from agriculture. These chemical compounds can have toxic effects on individual organisms and these effects can be enhanced when they occur in mixtures (Abdelghani et al., 1997; Connon et al., 2012) . For instance, pest control requires highly biologically active substances to target unwanted algae, fungi and arthropods.

Furthermore, many of the approaches used in environmental science and ecotoxicology to assess the environmental effects of pollutants only test a few selected genetic lineages of organisms (e.g., single strains of Daphnia), and often ignore both within-population variation in sensitivity to pollutants and the effects of mixtures of pollutants on organisms. For example, morphologically similar but genetically distinct lineages of amphipods, within the Gammarus fossarum cryptic species complex, vary in their sensitivity to the fungicide tebuconazole and the insecticide thiacloprid (Feckler et al., 2012) . Such lineage diversity within species is rarely accounted for in typical assessments of pollutants on organisms (Relyea & Hoverman, 2006) . Synthetic chemicals present a particular challenge because the exposed organisms may lack the exposure history necessary for the emergence of an evolutionary adaptation. Synthetic chemicals can also act as mutagens that disrupt the homeostasis of organisms (Bickham et al., 2000) .",

Unsurprisingly, adaptation of a population can also be an unwanted outcome of management, such as when the evolution of resistance reduces the sensitivity of a species used in ecological risk assessment (Morgan et al., 2007) . Evolution's ability to alter the direction of responses to environmental change, such as that brought by chemical pollution, is one of the main arguments for including evolutionary concepts in environmental research.

Selective grazing by zooplankton will deplete edible algae and, subsequently, increase the abundance of well-defended algae (Hairston et al., 2005; Takehito Yoshida et al., 2003) . Harmful algal blooms are characterised by an array of defense traits that are favored by natural selection. Some algae produce compounds that are toxic to grazers, such as the neurotoxins, saxitoxins and domoic acid produced by J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the emergence of harmful algal blooms (Burford et al., 2019; Jankowiak et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2010; Li et al., 2012) , but the selective factors that favour toxic variants in bloom forming algae are not fully understood. Identifying the evolutionary processes involved in algal blooms would likely help us predict which algal blooms might turn toxic. In a first step, reliable prediction would enable the avoidance of risks associated with toxic algal blooms (e.g. by timely establishment of exclusion zones), and in a second step, it could inform mitigation measures to reduce the occurrence of algal blooms (e.g. by influencing relevant selective forces such as nutrient input).",

A better appreciation of evolution's limits and, in particular, the impossibility of Darwinian demons, is critical to meeting our energy demands through the engineering of an algal genotype that optimally matches the organism to its environment, because some traits desirable for fuel production may be biologically incompatible with other, co-evolved traits.

On the one hand, seemingly rational solutions might require some 'evolution proofing' to effectively anticipate and limit any potential negative impacts of evolution on the expected outcomes of our interventions. On the other hand, evolution itself can be a powerful design strategy for solving environmental problems. Design by directed evolution, for example, has made considerable progress developing novel enzymes, and configuring communities to perform specific functions that improve environmental conditions. Natural selection is a powerful force that can efficiently explore the combinatorial trait space that organisms could theoretically occupy. The trait space of living systems is replete with opportunities to solve environmental problems, and natural selection might often outpace our own ability to find these solutions. Perhaps a way forward is to relinquish our engineering hubris in favor of a problem solving strategy that is either informed by, or directed by, evolution.
