Many of these incidents had local, regional and global repercussions and prompted tourism crises at corporate, industry and destination levels. Although some events were unprecedented, crisis and disaster have acquired greater prominence in recent years and the modern world appears to be one of heightened uncertainty and insecurity. Tourism cannot isolate itself from these forces and developments in the external environment have the capacity to precipitate tourism crises, as do industry and organizational circumstances. Some notable examples of tourism crises in the last decade are listed in Table 1 .1, and this pattern seems set to continue in the years ahead.",

It is also an increasingly popular conference theme for both business and academic communities, with a strong emphasis on understanding crises and being prepared to meet them.

It discusses the features of such crises, their origins and evolution and recommended responses within the context of the wider literature on crisis management. Distinguishing characteristics of the tourism industry, comprising public and private actors, are outlined and shown to heighten its vulnerability to crisis, which assumes a variety of forms and is provoked by assorted catalysts. The overview stresses the signifi cance of planning and management and sets the scene for the remainder of the book, which explores a multiplicity of tourism crises and the manner of their resolution.",

These do, however, frequently correspond and it appears that \"three elements must be present: a triggering event causing signifi cant change or having the potential to cause signifi cant change; the perceived inability to cope with this change; and a threat to the existence of the foundation of the organization\" (Keown-McMullan, 1997, p. 4) . A distinction can be drawn between disasters which owe their origins to factors such as extreme weather, yet impinge on industrial activity, and crises which are products of institutional stresses (Faulkner, 2001) . The latter are more amenable to control, but the two have qualities in common and are connected when catastrophes outside an organization provoke a crisis within it. Emergency is another term sometimes employed interchangeably with crisis, but it refers to a less serious and therefore more easily managed event or threat. An associated concept is that of risk pertaining to latent, rather than actual, individual or sets of conditions which can become crises if realized and of suffi cient gravity. Risk assessment is a key stage in planning for crisis, involving the anticipation of what might go wrong and identifi cation of the reasons for divergences from expectations (van Waldbeek, 2005) .",

Political events such as war, military coups, deteriorating international relations, the imposition of sanctions and terrorism will have a similar outcome. Civil unrest and growing crime and violence may act as triggers and natural disasters of earthquakes, typhoons, volcanic eruptions and fl ooding will almost inevitably do so.

Human error is often a compounding factor, or even a principal cause, in these and all forms of tourism crises. Table 1 .2 contains a list of threats of crisis by domain and whether they are external or internal to the tourism industry. There may be overlap across the domains and the demarcation between internal and external worlds is also not always clearly discernible. A crisis beyond the industry could be a rigorous test of management competence and the fi nancial health of an organization, with corporate and industrial commercial crises ensuing if these are found to be defi cient. The cause and source of a crisis will help to decide its consequences and severity can be assessed on a scale from major to minor, measured by items such as number of people implicated and costs incurred. Duration is a dimension of magnitude which embraces a short to long-term continuum, from a temporary computer systems collapse to a slowly mutating crisis linked to environmental degradation. Some crises have been likened to cobras when they erupt without warning and pythons if they reveal themselves more stealthily (Seymour and Moore, 2000) . Spatial and industrial scope is another facet to take into account. The zone of crisis may be local, national, regional and international with regard to geographical area and corporate, industrial (domestic and overseas) and government (local, national and international) with regard to decision makers.",

Leisure tourism demand is renowned for its elasticity, seasonality and volatility whereby a change in price will produce a disproportionate change in demand, movement is often heavily concentrated in certain months and fl ows can fl uctuate wildly (Bull, 1998) . It is driven by economics, subject to fashion trends and deterred by social and political upheaval. Tourists are unlikely to cease traveling in reaction to negative forces, but could shift their direction of travel and choice of destination.

It has a complex structure and sells experiential products which are the collective work of several suppliers, leading to possible problems of fragmentation and control. Relationships of mutual dependence among components also mean that a crisis for one may spread to another. Such contagion is evident in destination crises when a precipitating event leads to a sudden fall in arrivals which has repercussions for accommodation, attraction and transport providers as well as government agencies and tour operators and travel agents at home and abroad.",

There may be no, or very little, time for action prior to crises which arrive without warning and duration will depend on the particular case, as will the speed of recovery.

Risk awareness is fundamental to preparation and prevention and more serious situations require mechanisms for industry-wide and perhaps international cooperation.

For example, the parameters of initial risk assessment or environmental scanning exercises must be comparatively broad for the tourism industry in view of the importance of developments in outside arenas. Marketers cannot recall faulty tourism products and lives are endangered in the worst examples of service failure, necessitating appropriate safety procedures. Tourists may have to be repatriated or moved from destinations struck by crisis and arrangements made for those whose departure is imminent, with logistical and resource implications to be planned for. There is also recognition that certain tourism crises unfold in ways that cannot be forecast. Reality is more confused than logical models imply, those in charge may be unable to adhere to prearranged programs and managers have to struggle with formidable dilemmas for which they have no instructions. Faulkner's (2001) conceptual framework pertains to a tourist destination hit by a natural disaster and is one of the most commonly quoted. It has been employed, with and without amendment, in analyses of other types of tourism crises. The process commences with an initial pre-event phase, when avoiding a disaster or containing its consequences is still feasible, and moves on to a prodromal state in which this is no longer an option. The emergency period is a time for action to protect life and property and is followed by intermediate and long-term recovery before ultimate resolution. A list of responses to match each phase is presented, alongside management strategies founded on thorough and continuously reviewed and updated risk assessment and contingency plans. Overall, prerequisites of success in managing a tourism crisis are maximum preparedness, a willingness to accept responsibility, rapid action, transparency and good communications. Realizing these objectives is facilitated by a plan setting the direction for all personnel; some examples are discussed in the fi nal chapter.",

Indeed, it appears to be emerging as a distinct stream in the tourism literature. Much of this work is centered on case studies and concentrates on recovery marketing and management, demonstrating both good and bad practice. There is perhaps an emphasis on extrinsic causes of crisis rather than intrinsic organizational weaknesses and on destination perspectives. Tourism crises are shown to generate widespread, and potentially very damaging, publicity (Gonzalez-Herrero and Pratt, 1998; Lehrman, 1986) .",
