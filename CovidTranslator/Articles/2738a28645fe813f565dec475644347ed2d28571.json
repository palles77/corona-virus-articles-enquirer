Traditional heterogeneous mean-field models on metapopulation networks ignore the heterogeneity of individuals who are in different disease states in subpopulations with the same degree, resulting in inaccuracy in predicting the spread of disease. In this paper, we take heterogeneity of susceptible and infectious individuals in subpopulations with the same degree into account, and propose a deterministic unclosed general model according to Markov process on metapopulation networks to curve the global transmission of diseases precisely. Then we make the general model closed by putting forward two common assumptions: a two-dimensional constant distribution and a two-dimensional log-normal distribution, where the former is equivalent to the heterogeneous mean-field model, and the latter is a system of weighted ordinary differential equations. Further we make a stability analysis for two closed models and illustrate the results by numerical simulations. Next, we conduct a series of numerical simulations and stochastic simulations. Results indicate that our general model extends and optimizes the mean-field model. Finally, we investigate the impacts of total mobility rate on disease transmission and find that timely and comprehensive travel restriction in the early stage is an effective prevention and control of infectious diseases.",

The concept of metapopulation was put forward by Levins [9, 10] for the first time to investigate the processes of local extinction, recolonization and regional persistence of populations, which means \"the population of populations\". With the development of network transmission dynamics, the metapopulation model has been successfully applied to understand the transmission dynamics of mobility. The model is composed of a heterogeneous network of subpopulations, connected by mobility processes. Individuals in each subpopulation stay one of the two states: one is susceptible; the other is infectious. Individuals can move from a subpopulation to another along links of network. Once there exist infectious individuals in a subpopulation, it becomes infectious. For infectious diseases, a susceptible individual can be infected at rate \u03b2 and become infectious, while an infectious individual may recover at rate \u03bc and be susceptible spatially structured populations with well-defined social units (on a scale of countries, regions, cities, small as towns, villages, families) connected through individuals' mobility on networks, named \"metapopulation networks\" (see Fig. 1 ).",

It has been shown that substrate network structures play an essential role in the spatial spread of infectious diseases [12, 13, 15] . In real-world networks, human mobility patterns vary in a very complicated way, e.g., large-scale air-travel (typical case [11] ), small-scale recurrent visits of subpopulations (or commuting flows) [16-18, 26, 27] , etc. Safety-driven people's behavioral responses to the infectious diseases have also been found to be able to accelerate the infectious disease spread [19] [20] [21] [22] , contrary to willingness.

(1.6). Once I k i = I k j for some i and j, Eq. (1.6) does not hold. It is obvious that the HMF assumption in metapopulation network ignores heterogeneities in subpopulations with the same degree. Under this assumption, the total individuals, the numbers of susceptible individuals and infectious individuals in subpopulations with the same degree are always the same at any time, respectively, which is hard to achieve. Even though the size of a population in nodes with the same degree is identical, there may be a great difference for individuals in different states among nodes in the course of infectious disease spreading, resulting in error for forecasting infectious disease spreading. Motivated by reducing even eliminating this error, we take heterogeneities in subpopulations with the same degree into account, define the number of susceptible and infectious individuals in subpopulations with the same degree as a two-dimensional random variable and we propose a deterministic SIS model according to a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) on heterogeneous metapopulation networks to curve the global transmission of infections more precisely.

Then we closed the general model under the assumption of a two-dimensional constant distribution and two-dimensional log-normal distribution, respectively. And the existence and global stability of each of feasible equilibria of the system, which is based on twodimensional constant distribution, have been proved mathematically and illustrated by numerical simulations. It has been shown by simulations that the general model we derived generalizes and optimizes the HMF model. In the study of the effects of total mobility rate on infection spread, we have seen that total mobility rate has a huge impact on disease transmission speed, but it has no effect on the steady state of infections. It is worth noting that even for a relatively small total mobility rate, diseases will spread globally as long as time is long enough. Therefore, timely and comprehensive travel restrictions are critical for disease control and prevention. Although we have generalized and optimized the HMF model, there are still some problems in this paper to be further solved.",

It is showed that the steady state of moment closure model II is higher than the others. Hence the assumption of a two-dimensional log-normal distribution is inappropriate for metapopulation networks. In the steady state, general model I fits perfectly with stochastic simulations, and moment closure model I takes the second place. For an early stage of infectious diseases, they overestimate the spreading of diseases on different levels. Overall, the general model extends and optimizes the HMF model.",
