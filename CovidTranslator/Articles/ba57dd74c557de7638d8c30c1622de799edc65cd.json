These data would provide the evidence to determine key epidemiologic relationships, including the incubation period (time from exposure to onset of symptoms), the onset of symptoms leading to hospitalization, and the outcomes resulting from treatment (either discharge of patient or death). Descriptions of the variables listed in Figures 1 and 2 , along with suggestions for coding, are provided in the online Appendix 1 (http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/eid/vol10no7/03-0749_ app1.htm). For all tables, the column heading corresponds with the variable name (e.g., A represents the case identification [ID] number, B represents sex, C represents age). Figure 1 captures case-patient demographics, exposures, and symptoms. Suggested coding for demographic variables (online Appendix 1) include patient ID and age as continuous variables and sex and coexisting conditions (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes) or syndromes (HIV/AIDS) as categorical variables. Other categories for coexisting conditions can be added as appropriate (e.g., smoking). An important distinction should be made between patients who have no known diagnosed coexisting conditions (coded as none known) as opposed to patients for whom information about coexisting conditions is not available or missing (coded as unknown).",

This measure is vital for estimating the impact of control measures to reduce the transmission of SARS (4, 5) .

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate some of the most important data needed to understand and control the disease.
