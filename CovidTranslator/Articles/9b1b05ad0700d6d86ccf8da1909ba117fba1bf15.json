Serological and genetic tests for bovine leukemia virus (BLV) were performed because the calf was born from a cow infected with BLV. The serum had a weakly positive BLV antibody, and the BLV provirus was detected within neoplastic cells on performing polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Analysis of the BLV provirus integration site using inverse PCR revealed that the BLV integration site location was identical on all chromosomes in all tumor tissues examined. Thus, the tumor cells monoclonally proliferated following BLV infection. The present study shows that enzootic bovine leukosis can occur in a young animal, as in the twomonth-old calf in our study.",

            "text": "Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) is the etiological agent of enzootic bovine leukosis (EBL). BLV is horizontally transmitted by arthropods such as the horsefly or to calves via in utero infection and the ingestion of colostrum from a BLV-infected cow. Iatrogenic transmission can occur via surgical instruments or sleeves contaminated with infected blood during rectal palpation. Lymphoma occurs in approximately 5%-10% of BLV-infected cows, predominantly in animals older than 3-5 years (Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2014a) . The diagnosis of BLV infection is serologically determined via an agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Hoff-J\u00f8rgensen, 1989; Kettmann et al., 1994) . Another diagnostic method is the detection of the integrated BLV genome in blood and tissue samples using genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Fechner et al., 1996) . However, the BLV genome and antibody are detectable in some sporadic bovine leukosis (SBL) cases, including the juvenile form, which was unrelated to BLV infection (Jacobs et al., 1992) . The confirmation of only one or a few sites of BLV integration within a sampled tumor tissue is diagnostic of EBL because EBL tumors are mono-or oligoclonal in origin (Kettmann et al., 1980; Kettmann et al., 1983; Coulston et al., 1991; Murakami et al., 2011) . In the present study, we investigated a case of EBL in a two-month-old calf diagnosed by an integration site analysis of tumor tissues.",

A blood examination revealed leukocytosis (23,560 cells/ \u03bcL) with marked neutrophilia (15,078 cells/\u03bcL) including an increased number of stab cells (3063 cells/\u03bcL). The monocyte count was also slightly elevated (942 cells/\u03bcL), and the lymphocyte count was normal (4476 cells/\u03bcL). Eosinophils and basophils were not detected on a blood smear. The serum lactate dehydrogenase activity was 3432 units/L. The calf was humanely euthanized and necropsied. Generalized lymphadenomegaly was noted, and abnormal nodules were observed on the surface and in the parenchyma of the thoracic and abdominal organs (Fig. 1) . However, anemia, fever, and symmetrical enlargement of the lymph nodes, which are the general clinical signs of the juvenile form of SBL (Hendrick, 2002) , were not observed. A microbiological examination of the swabs of abscesses found in the lung and trachea detected bovine coronavirus, Actinomyces pyogenes, Streptococcus bovis, and Mycoplasma bovis. the Gentra Puregene Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Peripheral blood DNA was also extracted using the DNeasy Blood Fechner et al., 1997) . The following external primers were used: env5032 (5\u2032-TCTGTGCCAAGTCTCCCAGATA-3\u2032) and env5608r (5\u2032-AACAACAACCTCTGGGAAGGGT-3\u2032). This results in the amplification of a 598-bp fragment. A 444-bp fragment was produced using the following internal primers: env5099 (5\u2032-CCCACAAGGGCGG-CGCCGGTTT-3\u2032) and env5521r (5\u2032-GCGAGGCCGGGTCCAGAGCTGG-3\u2032). PCR was performed using the GoTaq Green Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI) and primers with a final concentration at 0.5 \u03bcM. Amplification during the first round of PCR was performed as follows: initial denaturation was at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, which was then followed by 40 cycles of the following 3 steps: at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 62\u00b0C for 30 s, and 72\u00b0C for 30 s. The second round of PCR was performed with the same protocol except that the annealing temperature was set at 70\u00b0C and 35 amplification cycles were performed.",

To make standard samples for quantitation, a partial BLV pol gene fragment was amplified from the genomic DNA of fetal lamb kidney cells persistently infected with BLV (FLK-BLV cells) (Van Der Maaten and Miller, 1975) using a primer set (Forward: 5\u2032-AAGCTCACCCACTGCAACTCT-3\u2032, Reverse: 5\u2032-TCTGATTGTGAGTCCAGAGGG-3\u2032) and cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

The RsaI-digested vector containing a pol fragment was subcloned into an EcoRV-digested ACTB-cloned vector. The resultant plasmid containing both pol and ACTB at a precisely equivalent molecular ratio was adjusted from 10 6 to 10 1 copies by 10-fold serial dilution using EASY Dilution (Takara); these were used as standard samples. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was performed by a Taqman probe assay using an ABI 7500 Fast thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and Thunderbird Probe qPCR Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). The primers and probe for pol were as follows: Forward (pol-4219F): 5\u2032-TTCACCTACGCTCTGCATGTG-3\u2032, Reverse (pol-4339R): 5\u2032-CCAGATGCACTATGGCCTCAA-3\u2032, and probe (pol-4256T): 5\u2032-FAM-CTGGAGCTACTCATGC-minor groove binder (MGB)-3\u2032.

All primers and probes were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific. The final concentration of each primer and probe was 0.6 \u03bcM and 0.2 \u03bcM, respectively. The PCR condition was as follows: 95\u00b0C, 20 s for the first denaturation, then 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C, 3 s and 60\u00b0C, 30 s. Copy numbers of the BLV provirus and ACTB gene were analyzed in the DNA from typical EBL tumors developed in 12 adult cows that were provided by a meat inspection center in Japan, in addition to the DNA from four tumor tissues and the peripheral blood of the present calf. qPCR was performed in duplicate. The mean pol number in 100 cells of each sample shown in the Results section was calculated as follows: [mean pol copy number/(mean ACTB copy number/2)] \u00d7 100. The entire proviral sequence of the BLV strain from the infected calf was determined using conventional PCR. Sequencing was facilitated by dividing the provirus into 22 parts and using the primers designed from the BLV sequences obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed).",

Conventional diagnostic methods for BLV infection, which include antibody tests and PCR for the amplification of the gene fragment of the BLV provirus, are unable to distinguish between EBL and SBL cases with BLV infection. However, the location of the BLV integration site within the tumor tissue in an EBL case is identical as EBL tumor cells are monoclonal in nature and proliferate from a single transformed cell. In the present case, the diagnosis of EBL was established by iPCR because BLV had identical integration sites in anatomically different tumors. Although the BLV provirus was detected in approximately half of the total cells examined from the four tumorous lymph nodes, we attribute this to the contamination of BLV-negative stromal cells. A comparable level of the BLV pol gene was amplified in adult EBL tumors. Tumor cells were classified as B-2 (conventional B) cells as they were CD5 \u2212 /CD11b \u2212 and T-cell marker negative (Ikeda et al., 2005) .",

This may be attributed to the recent infection with BLV and the rapid progression of the tumor before a clinically detectable amount of BLV antibodies could be produced because newborn calves have a weaker immune response than adults and their antibody-producing ability is relatively inade- quate (Ingram and Smith, 1965; Senogles et al., 1979) . However, there is the considerable possibility that the host had an immune deficiency against BLV. The AGID test showed a weakly positive BLV antibody, which may have been elicited by remnant maternal antibodies that were transferred from the colostrum and attributable to a weak immunoreaction against BLV. Cases of in utero infection may lead to an immune tolerance toward BLV as observed in bovine viral diarrhea virus infection (McClurkin et al., 1984) , although this has not been reported. The vertical transmission of human T-lymphotropic virus-I, which is closely related to BLV, has been suggested to be a risk factor for the onset of adult T-cell leukemia (Proietti et al., 2005) .",

Perinatal infection has been shown to lead to a high proviral load in calves without EBL (Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2014b) . Some studies have noted a relationship between a high BLV provirus copy number and disease severity (Aida et al., 2013) . Accordingly, an analysis of the relationship between the provirus number in blood and EBL development is considered to be important.
