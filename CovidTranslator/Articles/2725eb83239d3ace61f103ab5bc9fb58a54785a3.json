Design and assessment tools are beneficial to assist the government, planners, engineers, architects, designers and industry stakeholders to better optimize air ventilation for the city. In 2003, after Hong Kong was hit by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) from which many people died, there were calls from the community for measures to improve the quality of our urban living environment. Among the recommendations in the Team Clean Final Report [1] , it was proposed to examine the practicality of stipulating air ventilation assessment (AVA) as one of the considerations for all major development or redevelopment proposals and in future planning.",

It was very quickly established that although many countries have codes and design guidelines for gust and strong wind problems [5, 6] , few seem to have touched on the issue of urban air stagnation and city air ventilation problems. Notable exceptions are studies dealing with air pollution and dispersion [7, 8] , for example Professor Chris Baker's group at Birmingham University [9, 10] . In Japan, The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has an environmental map so that designated areas for the implementation of measures can be identified and used as a guide for redevelopment projects [11] (Fig. 2 ). In Germany, there is a legal requirement that developments should not worsen the climatic conditions of the site. Urban climatic maps have been produced (Fig. 3) . They have been used to guide planning and development decisions. In the city of Kassel, the climatic map has been translated into a planning evaluation map. This map further identifies possible action for planners to reference [12, 13] . Using this guiding map, which has factored the dynamic characteristics of the wind movement in the city to alleviate the adverse effects of urban heat islands, planners can decide if a development might block the wind to the city, and if a project proponent should be given permission, or is required to do further tests to provide justification. The review also identified ad-hoc studies in Hong Kong dealing with the wind environment for extreme high-density conditions. But in Hong Kong, weak wind studies are still rare.",

The channelling effect created by the void also helps to improve ventilation performance for those residential units at the lower floors.

According to the results of both studies, relative humidity (RH) has been shown to have a statistically insignificant effect on comfort perception [14, 15] . Based on his formulas and the meteorological data of Hong Kong, a comfort outdoor temperature chart for urban Hong Kong was developed (Fig. 4) . The x-axis of the chart is the outdoor air temperature and the y-axis is the level of solar radiation. The shaded area represents the neutral comfort region which could be obtained by a proper combination of air temperature, solar radiation and wind speed. The chart provides a guide to the kind of wind environment that is desirable in Hong Kong.

Based on the power law extrapolation, a mean wind of some 6 to 8 m/s at the boundary layer of 500 m can be predicted. With wind tunnel and CFD studies of urban areas of Hong Kong, urban wind velocity ratio (a ratio of pedestrian level wind at 2 m and boundary level wind at 500 m) of 0.3 near the waterfront and in open spaces, and 0.05-0.1 in streets and congested urban spaces can be expected. As such, one immediately sees the need for planning of the city to optimize the site wind availability so that at the pedestrian level of 2 m above ground, wind is available, especially in streets and congested urban spaces. [16] Taking into account the above ''wind for thermal comfort'' considerations, various climatic and urban factors, and given Hong Kong's high-density conditions, it was opined that, for planning considerations, optimizing or maximizing air ventilation through the city fabric is the focus of air ventilation assessment (AVA). In general, ''the more air ventilation the better'' is the approach -save some isolated gust problems that in most cases could be dealt with locally. Given the natural wind availability of the site, a high probability of a gentle breeze at pedestrian level is a useful criterion. Taking into account the general high-density urban morphology of Hong Kong, and the macro wind availability, it is recommended that the city fabric should in general be as permeable and porous as possible. As such, the air ventilation assessment system should be developed to encourage this permeability to happen.",

The study has again been entrusted to researchers of the Chinese University of Hong Kong with the collaboration of many local and overseas experts and specialists. The study will draw together expertise and experience from academics, scientists, meteorologists of the Hong Kong Observatory, planners, architects and various construction industry stakeholders. Apart from drafting an urban climatic analysis map and a planning recommendation map for Hong Kong with reference to the German experience [21, 22] , field studies, user surveys, wind tunnel tests, mesoscale MM5 wind simulations, computational fluid dynamics simulation tests will also be conducted.",
