Several in vitro and in vivo experimental models have been used to study TB pathogenesis and induction of immune response during Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Precision cut lung tissue slices (PCLTS) is an experimental model, in which all the usual cell types of the organ are found, the tissue architecture and the interactions amongst the different cells are maintained. PCLTS in good physiological conditions, monitored by MTT assay and histology, were infected with either virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv or the TB vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis BCG. Histological analysis showed that bacilli infecting lung tissue slices were observed in the alveolar septa, alveolar light spaces, near to type II pneumocytes, and inside macrophages. Mycobacterial infection of PCLTS induced TNF-a production, which is consistent with previous M. tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo studies. This is the first report of using PCLTS as a system to study M. tuberculosis infection. The PCLTS model provides a useful tool to evaluate the innate immune responses and other aspects during the early stages of mycobacterial infection.",

Here, we present an alternative and complementary ex vivo model using murine precision cut lung tissue slices to study M. tuberculosis infection. In this system all the usual cell types of the lung are present, the tissue architecture is maintained, as are the interactions between the different cells, and also important, the metabolic and transport functions are preserved. Additionally, at present it is virtually impossible to stop using animals in research and in a support for the moral and ethical issues handling experimental animals, this model reduces the number of animals used by experiment.",

Migration of immune cells is a signal that PCLTS remain immunologically active. Henjakovic et al. [27] reported that immunoactive substances such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), macrophage-activating lipopeptide-2 (MALP-2), interferon-g (IFNg), and dexamethasone induced the characteristic responses to these substances in PCLTS. These facts support this model as suitable to test immune responses against pathogens.

Peaks of expression were at 6 h after infection with an increase of 2.62 and 3.38 fold for M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG, respectively. Differences in expression are not due to differential growth of strains as differences in the number of CFU per slice were not statistically significant as shown in Table 1 , but due to differential TNF-a induction by the infecting strains. These results agree with those reported by Wong et al. [28] where they found that virulent strains produced a lower induction of TNF-a than non-virulent strains. These findings suggest that virulent strains may inhibit cellular mechanism to evade innate immune response. An example is the suppression of IL-12 production and negative regulation of apoptosis in host macrophages [29e31] which would allow mycobacteria to survive inside the cells protected from immune response, helping further tissue dissemination.",

In the PCLTS we observed bacilli in contact with epithelial cells as well as intracellular bacteria in macrophages. Bacteria were easily located in alveolar space and close or in contact with type II pneumocytes. Although we did not find evidence of intracellular bacteria in these cells, it cannot be discarded cell invasion occurs. Our model analyze early stages of infection up to 48 h and further ultrastructure analysis is needed to confirm infection of pneumocytes in PCLTS. Detailed comparisons of mycobacterial infections in PCLTS to infections by other species may reveal common mechanisms to human infection. The close proximity of mycobacteria to pneumocytes type II in PCLTS may represent a relevant and preferential location to the infection process as it is well known that mycobacteria invade human lung epithelial cells[22e26].The histological analysis showed, 24 h after M. tuberculosis infection, a moderate infiltrate of immune cells into the areas with a higher number of M. tuberculosis bacteria. This movement is similar to the increase of lymphocytes and plasmacytic cells in infection areas with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Chlamydophila pneumoniae observed by Ebsen et al.",
