A plaquepurified stock of the bovine enteric coronavirus (BCV; Mebus strain) was grown on the human rectal tumor cell line (HRT-18) (3) using previously described methods (4) . Cells were grown on Dulbecco's modified minimum essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sterile Systems, Inc.). Cells were infected with a multiplicity of 1, and supernatant fluids were harvested at 48-72 hr postinfection, and clarified at 10,000 g for 5 rain. A plaque-purified stock of the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV; Purdue strain) was grown on the swine testicle cell line (ST) (5) using previously described methods (6) . Cells were grown on DMEM with 10% adult bovine serum (Sterile Systems, Inc.). Cells were infected with a multiplicity of 1, and supernatant fluids were harvested at 18-24 hr postinfection, and clarified at 10,000 g for 5 rain. Each virus was separately pelleted in 38-ml tubes on a Sorval 627 rotor at 26,000 rpm, 2 hr, at 4 ~ C through a 3-rul cushion of 20% sucrose w/w in TMEN-6 buffer [50 mM Tris acid maleate (pH 6), 0.1 M NaC1, and 1 mM EDTA], and the pellet was dissolved in sample treatment buffer [62.5 mM Tris hydrochloride (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5 M urea] and diluted with sample treatment buffer until the concentration of viral protein was approximately 15 ~g/~! as determined by Coomassie blue staining of 1-1xl aliquots on nitrocellulose (7) . Viral proteins were electrophoretically separated using the discontinuous buffer method of Laemm!i (8) . Approximately 1.2 mg of viral protein was spread along a continuous well of a vertical slab (0.75 \u2022 100 x 160 mm) electrophoresis apparatus (Hoeffer Scientific Instruments) and electrophoresed through a 1-cm stacking gel of 3% polyacrylamide and an 8-cm separating gel of 9% polyacryl-amide. Electrophoretic transfer of viral proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets was done by the method of Burnette (7) . Nitrocellulose sheets containing viral proteins were marked for alignment, cut into strips of 5 mm width, and each strip was incubated with a 1:10 dilution of serum in 15-ml, siliconized, plastic, screw-capped centrifuge tubes. The procedure of Burnette (7) was used for radiodetection of bound immunoglobulins using 125I-labeled Staphylococcus-A protein. 1251labeled Staphylor protein (2-10 ixCi/txg) was purchased from ICN. Strips were then exposed to Kodak X-Omat R film for autoradiography.",

Initial attempts have not yet been successful on primary marmoset cells and on cell lines of other animal species. Inasmuch as replication of coronaviruses is enhanced on transformed cells (11) , transformed marmoset cells should be tried. (2) Serum from a variety of colony animals should be used to attempt precipitation of viral particles by immune electron microscopy (10) .

Whereas no attempt has yet been made to react marmoset serum with the coronavirus-like particles observed in marmoset feces, marmoset serum was used to identify serological reactivity to the bovine enteric coronavirus and to the porcine tranmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus, each a representative of the two antigenic subfamilies of mammalian coronaviruses (12) . Reactivity in six marmosets was observed for the internal 50-kd phosphoprotein and the 26-kd glycoprotein of the bovine coronavirus but not to any identifiable protein of the porcine gastroenteritis coronavirus. Since the 50-kd and 26-kd proteins are largely internal virion proteins (4), they probably represent evolutionarily conserved proteins within this antigenic subgroup of coronaviruses.",

They have been found in the stools of nonhuman primates with diarrhea, but their role in this disease was not obvious since they were also found in the stools of nondiseased animals (20) . The role of coronaviruses in chronic gastrointestinal disease in animals and man has been more difficult to establish. Persistent shedding of coronaviruses from many animal species is documented, but no correlation with chronic intestinal disease has yet been made (13, 21) . Persistent shedding of coronavirus-like particles was observed over an eight-month period in a human individual with chronic intestinal maladsorption and suggests a possible role by coronaviruses in this disease (22) .",

Histopathological findings in the large bowel for this disease are mild to moderate infiltration of mononuclear cells, neutrophils, and eosinophils in the lamina propria; cryptitis; and crypt abscesses (25) (26) (27) . Age groups affected are mainly teens and adults, although cases have been reported in infants and children. Infection is usually not severe and is generally self-limiting (23, 24) . Campylobacter has been implicated in persistent and recurrent diarrhea of infants and adults (28, 29) . Campylobacter also has been implicated in acute and persistent diarrhea in nonhuman primates (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) , but its high prevalence in apparently normal animals makes it difficult to establish its role in chronic disease (34, 35) . Experimental infection has not been successful in some studies (36) , although oral infection of young nonhuman primates with a human isolate caused mild disease of short duration (35) . Histopathologic findings were absent in experimentally infected Macaca mulatta (35) . Mild nonsuppurative enteritis was reported in Erythrocelous patus monkeys with persistent diarrhea from which Campylobacter was isolated (32) .",
