            "text": "[63] Fatty Acid Acylation of Eukaryotic Cell Proteins By MILTON J. SCHLESINGER There are numerous examples of proteins and enzymes whose structure and function involve an intimate association with lipid. For most of these proteins, the lipid fraction can be dissociated relatively easily and protein obtained lipid-free. For others, the lipid moiety is tightly complexed and strong denaturants are needed to remove lipid, leading in many cases to denatured enzymes. There is a third group of proteins for which the lipid moiety can be removed only under conditions that cleave covalent bonds. The latter proteins can be divided into two general types. The first type has long-chain fatty acids esterified to glycerol that is linked in a thioether bond to a cysteinyl residue of the protein. Proteins of this kind are found, thus far, only in prokaryotic organisms and are localized to the outer membranes of cells.~ The second type has long-chain fatty acids esterified to amino acids that are part of the polypeptide backbone of the protein. Proteins of this kind are localized to the membranes of eukaryotic cells or their viruses. 2 It is the latter group that is to be described in some detail in this section.",

            "text": "Many of the data pertaining to fatty acid acylation of eukaryotic cell membrane proteins come from studies with those glycoproteins that form the external spikes on enveloped RNA animal viruses. This is because virus-infected tissue culture cells provide a particularly advantageous system for examining events that occur during synthesis, transport, and maturation of membrane-bound glycoproteins. Infection of cells with many of these viruses establishes within a few hours a virtually synchronous synthesis of millions of molecules of a very few virus-coded proteins that are acted upon by cellular enzymes involved in the normal processing and transporting of cellular membrane proteins (see this volume [36] ). There is abundant evidence that the events required to synthesize and translocate virus-specified membrane-bound glycoprotein are identical to those occurring when uninfected cells synthesize glycoproteins and translocate them through intracellular organelles to the plasma membrane? But, when compared to events during normal cell growth in which there might be -100 different membrane proteins undergoing processing asynchron- ously through a cell growth cycle of 24 hr, the one or two \"synchronously\" made virus-membrane proteins constitute about a 100-to 1000fold increase in \"sensitivity\" for detecting processing events. It is, undoubtedly, this feature of the virus tissue culture system that has permitted the relatively straightforward study of fatty acid acylated proteins.",

The gel is processed directly for fluorography using DMSO-PPO. ~5 Attempts to stain the gel for protein or fix gels in methanol-acetic acid prior to fluorography may lead to loss of bound fatty acid. Use of other reagents for fluorography also decreases the amounts of bound fatty acid. Of the order of 100-200 cpm of 3H-labeled fatty acid in a single protein band can be detected after a 4-to 5-day exposure of the film in cassettes stored at -70 \u00b0 . Detection of low levels of radioactivity can be increased by flashing the film prior to exposure.~5 Accurate quantitation (to -+5%) of the radioactivity in protein bands is obtained by orienting the fluorogram over the dried gel and carefully excising the gel with a scalpel.

When performing this hydrolysis on material separated in gels, it is important to treat samples before the gels have been dried or heated. For analyzing protein not well separated from bulk lipid, (i.e., a membrane fraction or a virus preparation) the protein should be thoroughly delipidated by organic solvent extraction, for example, using sequentially chloroform-methanol (2: 1), chloroform-methanol (1:2), chloroform-methanol, H20 (1 : 1 : 0.3), and acetone. After delipidation, the hydrolysis reaction is carried out. The released fatty acid is extracted with heptane or pentane and analyzed quantitatively by gas chromatography 4 or qualitatively by thin-layer chromatography. The reaction with methanolic KOH converts the fatty acid to the methyl ester, and it can be analyzed without further conversion to an ester with diazomethane.",

This root portion of the glycoprotein contains the covalent bound fatty acid. 5'17-2\u00b0 Small peptide fragments of VSV-G with esterified fatty acid have been purified in low yields and shown to be enriched in serine. 6 We do not know yet precisely which amino acid(s) in the protein sequence have acylated fatty acids.

In vivo studies carried out with VSV-and Sindbis virus-infected cells (this volume [40] ) show that the glycoproteins are acylated after synthesis of the polypeptide chains has been completed, but before substantial processing occurs to the protein-bound oligosaccharides. 21'~2 Based on these data, a site in the cell's smooth endoplasmic reticulum or \"early\" (cis) Golgi complex has been suggested as the cellular site of acylation (this volume [36]). The donor for fatty acid could be newly synthesized long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, fatty acylcarnitine, or fatty acid from neutral or phospholipid. There are data indicating that exchange of fatty acid can occur between membrane lipid and protein. 23 The function of fatty acid in membrane proteins is unknown. It has been suggested that fatty acid acylation might be important for proper intracellular transport of proteins destined to be localized to the plasma membrane. There are, however, several virus membrane proteins 5 (the neuraminidase of influenza virus, the HN protein of Newcastle disease virus, and the E 1 protein of corona virus) that do appear at the cell surface membrane but are not acylated. Results of studies using the antibiotic cerulenin showed that VSV G protein acylation can be blocked, yet transport of G to the cell surface is normal. 24 In addition, the G protein from a VSV New Jersey serotype (Ogden) does not become acylated, yet is incorporated efficiently into biologically active virions. 25 The fatty acid acylated VSV-G (from an Indiana serotype) differs from the nonacylated New Jersey serotype G form in several amino acids in that part of the polypeptide embedded in the lipid bilayer. 25 Thus, appropriate modifications to the protein's structure can circumvent any possible essential need for fatty acid.",
