Furthermore, viruses such as influenza A and B, parainfluenza (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (AdV) often cause more severe manifestations in immunocompromised individuals, including solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs) [3] . While influenza infection is known to cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised as well as immunocompetent populations [4] , there are fewer data on the other viruses that cause respiratory infection in SOTRs. In recent decades, more effective and sustained immunosuppressive therapy has been developed and incorporated into antirejection regimens, decreasing the incidence and degree of rejection episodes in this population [2] . However, simultaneous with enhanced immunosuppression is the increased risk for infection, including that due to respiratory viruses.",

            "text": "The reported rates of respiratory virus infections (RVIs) among SOTRs vary widely in the literature [2] . For example, among lung SOTRs, the incidence of RVIs in published reports ranges from 1.4% to 60%, likely due to the heterogeneity of the types of patients screened, including whether patients are symptomatic or asymptomatic at the time of screening [5, 6] . Furthermore, most studies may select for cases of more severe disease by including only hospitalized patients or those being seen by a healthcare provider in the outpatient setting. Patients with milder respiratory symptoms may be less inclined to seek medical attention. Another problem is that even those hospitalized with respiratory infection may not undergo appropriate procedures to make a diagnosis. Until recently, identifying specific respiratory pathogens was difficult, given the similarity in clinical presentation among potential pathogens and the time-consuming nature of available microbiologic techniques such as cell culture or serologic assays. Molecular diagnostics now available in most laboratories can provide more rapid and reliable diagnoses compared to older techniques including antigen detection [3, 7, 8] . In addition, molecular diagnostics have led to the identification of respiratory tract viruses not previously recognized to be common or important pathogens, including, for instance, bocavirus, certain enteroviruses and coronaviruses [8, 9] .",

Aside from perhaps PIV, RVIs in SOTRs tend to parallel the seasonal nature of infections in the immunocompetent [3, 10, 11] . However, SOTRs may have atypical presentations, including few or no symptoms at onset with subsequent progression to severe life-threatening disease [3, 10, [12] [13] [14] [15] . SOTRs may also shed virus for very prolonged periods of time even in the absence of symptoms and thus can spread viruses nosocomially to a greater degree, with potentially devastating consequences to other hospitalized SOTRs [16, 17] . Co-infection with bacteria and fungi are also more commonly seen in transplant recipients with RVIs [18] .",

In addition, decreasing immunosuppression may be feasible in order to speed up the resolution of a viral infection, and appropriate isolation precautions must be instituted in the hospital setting to limit spread [17] . As noted above, molecular diagnostics are a mainstay of diagnosis of RVIs, and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays using multiple primer pairs to detect a variety of different target sequences can be an efficient and cost-effective means for diagnosis [2, 3, 9, 19 ]. Of note, Preikasaitis et al. recently demonstrated the feasibility of patient-collected nasopharyngeal swabs for diagnosis of RVI in SOTRs [20] .",

In addition, respiratory viral infections are thought to be a risk factor for the development of rejection and/or bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) among lung SOTRs, although this is not consistently demonstrated in the literature [5, 11, [22] [23] [24] . A cohort of 100 lung transplant recipients, 50 with RVI and 50 without RVI, was followed for 3 months and demonstrated an acute rejection rate of 16% in the RVI group compared to 0% in those without RVI, and greater decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) in the RVI group [23]. However, in a pooled analysis, Vu et al. (2011) were unable to confirm the link between acute rejection and RVI and there were not sufficient numbers to assess the association of RVI and BOS [5] . McCurdyet al. reported were significantly associated with acute rejection and a decline in lung function at 1 and 3 months [6] . Definitive assessment of the association between RVIs and acute and chronic rejection will require further study with larger cohorts of patients.",

In general, all SOTRs suspected of having an RVI should have a nasopharyngeal swab, wash, or aspirate obtained and sent for rapid testing, ideally with PCR-based assays using nucleic acid amplification that can detect a broad range of respiratory pathogens [3] . Culture, antigen detection, and serology have largely been replaced by more sensitive PCR methods. Multiplex PCRs, which are widely used by most transplant centers [27], identify a variety of pathogens not detected by conventional methods [3, 8] but may vary in sensitivity and specificity for the detection of AdV [3, 7, 28] . Quantitative AdV PCR from blood may also be obtained to aid in diagnosis. The features and possible pharmacologic therapies for important non-influenza RVIs in the SOTR population are discussed below and summarized in Table 1 .",

            "text": "AdV is a non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA virus with over 50 serotypes classified into subgroups A-G. AdV causes a variety of usually self-limited infection manifestations in immunocompetent individuals, and AdV is more common in children in both the immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations. Certain AdV serotypes have a predilection for causing pulmonary infection, including subgroups B1 (serotypes 3, 7, 16, 21, 50), B2 (serotypes 11, 14, 34, 35) , C (serotypes 1, 2, 5, 6), and E (serotype 4) [29] . Immunocompromised patients can become ill from newly acquired infection or reactivation of latent virus from prior infection [14, 29, 30] . AdV infection in SOTRs typically occurs within the first year after transplant [14, 29, 31] and tends to cause more frequent and severe disease in lung transplant recipients [29, 32] . Humar et al. reported finding AdV in 19 of 263 SOTRs (7.2%) [14] , although none were lung transplant recipients. Viremia was universal and some were asymptomatic. All patients in this cohort recovered from their infection with no consequences. In a cohort of lung transplant recipients, the reported incidence of AdV infection was 22.5%, with most being asymptomatic and no association with rejection or decline in pulmonary function [31] . However, others have reported pediatric and adult SOTRs with severe necrotizing pneumonia ( Figure 1 ) and AdV-associated mortality [13, 14, [32] [33] [34] . Patients who receive antilymphocyte antibodies are at an increased risk of developing AdV infection, and an increase in AdV-specific T lymphocytes has been associated with resolution of AdV in blood and lungs [35, 36] .

However, cidofovir, a cytosine analog that interrupts AdV replication in vitro, is often used for treatment of more severe infections [30, 33, 35] . The intracellular diphosphate form of cidofovir acts as an AdV DNA polymerase substrate that is preferred over other cellular substrates, and cidofovir possesses in vitro activity against all AdV serotypes [30, 37, 38] . No prospective controlled trials have been conducted using cidofovir for AdV infection, and its efficacy remains uncertain. Data come from non-randomized series and case reports (mostly in hematopoietic stem cell transplant [HSCT] recipients [HSCTRs] and for various sites of infection including cystitis and enteritis), with varying results including failures [39] as well as clearance of viremia and possible mortality benefit [13, 33, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] .",

Preliminary data from HSCTRs have demonstrated mixed results. There were improved outcomes in pediatric patients compared to adults with disseminated infection (19% mortality vs. 43% mortality, respectively), and a rapid decline in viral load was noted for many patients as well as improved overall survival among those with an antiviral response [49] . However, BCV was discontinued due to adverse events (primarily gastrointestinal) in 20% of pediatric and 29% of adult subjects [49] , and there was no difference in survival between those treated with BCV compared to historical controls, a finding that investigators believed was due to baseline differences in the two cohorts [50] . Florescu and colleagues reported on the safety and efficacy of BCV as salvage therapy in 13 immunocompromised patients with severe AdV infection. They noted that nine patients showed virologic response by 8 weeks, and these patients had longer survival compared to those who did not exhibit a viral response (196 days vs. 55 days) [51] .",

RSV infection typically manifests as an URTI in SOTRs with cough as the predominant symptom followed by dyspnea and fever [58, 65, 66] . RSV infection progresses to LRTI in 27-67% of SOTRs (Figure 2(a,b) [58, 65, 66] . In addition, SOTRs with RSV infection may have difficulty clearing the infection due to immunosuppression, resulting in prolonged viral shedding [58, 67] . Mechanical ventilation has been required in up to 25% of SOTRs with RSV infection but mortality in this population, even in the absence of antiviral therapy, is relatively low in published series, 0-13% [26, 52, 58, 62, 66, [68] [69] [70] . Of note, in one series where appreciable RSV-related mortality was noted (4/30, 13% overall), mortality was 22% among 18 SOTRs more than 1 year after SOT compared to 0% among 12 SOTRs within 1 year of SOT [66] .",

In a larger case series, Liu et al. described 23 episodes of RSV among lung or heart/lung SOTRs [64] . Patients were given aerosolized RBV 2 gm every 8 h for 15 doses, methylprednisolone 500 mg once daily for 3 days, and one dose each of IVIG 0.5 mg/kg and palivizumab 15 mg/kg. No patients with URTI progressed to LRTI, and no treatment episodes required mechanical ventilation. No adverse effects were noted, and one patient died of worsening preexisting liver failure unrelated to RSV infection.

It must be given with a small particle nebulizer at a dose of 6 gm daily, aerosolized continuously over 18 h, or 2 gm every 8 h over 2 h each [72, 73] . During this time, the patient is confined to an oxygen hood or drug-scavenging tent to protect health-care workers and other patients from RBV exposure due to its teratogenic potential [73, 76] . In addition to the logistically complicated administration, the drug is associated with serious toxicities such as hemolytic anemia [3, 26, 52, 62] . Intravenous (IV) or oral (PO) RBV may be given as alternative to aerosolized RBV. Glanville et al. gave IV RBV 33 mg/kg in three divided doses on day 1 followed by 20 mg/kg in three divided doses to 18 lung SOTRs with RSV LRTI [63] . RBV was given in combination with prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day (up to 60 mg) weaned by 5 mg every other day until at baseline steroid dose. Treatment was continued until repeat nasopharyngeal swab was negative for RSV. No patient required mechanical ventilation, and there was no mortality. The same group of investigators gave the aforementioned IV loading dose of RBV followed by PO RBV 20 mg/kg in two divided doses (rounded to nearest 200 mg) to 52 lung SOTRs with 56 episodes of RSV LRTI for a median duration of therapy of 8 days [62] . RBV was given in combination with prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day with a taper as in the IV study. Worsening anemia was noted in 23 of 33 episodes among patients with preexisting anemia and de novo anemia in 5 of 21 episodes. No patient required mechanical ventilation, and there was no infection-related mortality although there were four late deaths unrelated to infection. One and two patients, respectively, had new-onset BOS at 3 and 6 months afterward.",

No patient required mechanical ventilation and there was no mortality. One patient developed mild anemia that did not require treatment. In a larger cohort, Fuehner et al. Graft function recovery at 30 days was more common among RBV recipients compared to those receiving supportive care (84% vs. 59%, p = 0.02), and new-onset BOS occurred less frequently in the RBV group (5% vs. 24%, p = 0.02). A high rate of RBV recipients (26%) required premature drug discontinuation due to adverse effects (5 hemolysis, 4 renal failure, 1 nausea). Li et al. compared the outcomes of six lung SOTRs who received PO RBV (400 mg 3 times daily) to 15 lung SOTRs who received aerosolized RBV (6 gm over 12 h) for RSV infection [68] .

Eight of 12 had LRTI and were given either aerosolized (6 gm over 18 h) or PO RBV at doses of 600-1800 mg/day in two to three divided doses. Three patients with LRTI also received palivizumab, and two of these also received IVIG. One patient with URTI received PO RBV. Although 25% required mechanical ventilation, there was no mortality associated with the infection. Subsequent investigators have given PO or aerosolized RBV to non-lung SOTRs for RSV infection, but the numbers are relatively small and in some reports have been pooled with lung SOTRs and/or HSCTRs, which makes it difficult to determine the drug's utility in non-lung SOTRs [65, 66] .",

As described above, there are a small number of case series that report the use of IVIG and/or palivizumab in combination with RBV, but antibody therapy has not been studied as a stand-alone treatment [58, 64, 66] . RSV-IVIG was removed from the market in 1998 due to the introduction of palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody against the RSV fusion (F) protein. It is FDA-approved for the prophylaxis of RSV in high-risk infants during RSV season [77] . As above, Liu et al. and Aziza-Heredia et al. reported giving palivizumab in combination with RBV \u00b1 IVIG and/or methylprednisolone [58, 64] . Grodin et al. reported the successful treatment of a 70-year-old heart transplant recipient who received one dose of palivizumab (7.5 mg/kg = 900 mg) in combination with aerosolized RBV, IVIG, and methylprednisolone [78] . Palivizumab prophylaxis is frequently given outside of RSV season to pediatric SOTRs (93% of centers give to infants up to 12 months and 79% to infants up to 24 months) [79] , although it has not been studied for this indication. Motavizumab (MedImmune, LLC/AstraZeneca, Wilmington, DE) is a second-generation humanized monoclonal antibody with~70-fold higher affinity for the RSV F protein and 20-fold greater neutralizing capacity than palivizumab [80] . When compared to palivizumab for RSV prophylaxis in high-risk children, motavizumab demonstrated 26% fewer RSV-associated hospitalizations and a 50% decrease in outpatient RSV LRTIs [81] . Concerns about increased nonfatal hypersensitivity reactions led the FDA to deny the drug's licensed approval, and development for that indication has ceased [82] . A recent report described the use of high-titer anti-RSV neutralizing antibody (RI-001, ADMA Biologics, Inc, Ramsey, NJ) for the treatment of 15 patients with hematologic malignancy or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and RSV LRTI [83] . Eleven of 15 patients survived, and survivors had a shorter time from RSV diagnosis to initiation of RI-001.",

There are significantly fewer data on PIV infection in SOTRs compared to HSCT recipients, and most data in SOTRs are in lung transplant recipients. A review of 32 PIV infections in 24 lung transplant recipients over 10 years revealed that infection occurred a median of 2 years after transplant (range 0.6-5 years); respiratory failure developed in 21% and BOS in 32% [98] . Most infections were caused by PIV-3; this type also causes the majority of infections in HSCTRs [26] . URTI is the most common manifestation although it can progress to LRTI, resulting in fatal infection; there was an 8% mortality in the review of lung transplant recipients noted above [98] . PIV infection may be most serious in pediatric SOTRs as well as lung SOTRs of any age. And, of the respiratory viruses, PIV is most strongly associated with the development of BOS in lung SOTRs [3, 23 ].",

However, further work is needed in this area since clinically available treatments are limited, toxic, unproven, or unavailable, depending on the virus in question. Novel antivirals such as DAS-181 and brincidofovir have been highly anticipated, but the latter's future is uncertain given its mixed results in recent studies of immunocompromised patients with CMV infection [134] and AdV infection [49] . Broad-spectrum antivirals possessing activity against multiple RVIs and a high barrier to the development of resistance could provide great benefit.",

Not all SOTRs will develop LRTI or respiratory failure, and the adverse effects of these medications may be significant. Having predictors of poor outcomes would be extremely useful. Some studies have shown a correlation of viral loads with severe disease due to RVIs [86, 135] , but more work is needed to identify viral load cutoffs that predict LRTI or respiratory failure and whether quantification of upper respiratory tract viral loads predict viral burden in the lower respiratory tract [136] . As noted above, the strategy of preemptive therapy for AdV infection via monitoring quantitative viral loads in blood has been advocated in allogeneic HSCT recipients [30] , but such strategies have yet to be established as beneficial in SOTRs [30] .",

Immune reconstitution is an important factor in recovery from infection in organ transplantation and, as noted above, the use of specific immunotherapies such as virus-specific T cells, particularly those that are simultaneously active against multiple viruses, may be a significant advance in antiviral therapy. To allow for broad application of this technology, it would be optimal if such cells could be made from donors who are seronegative (e.g. using cord blood-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes) or derived from other third parties as 'off-the-shelf' therapy [137] .",

CRTh2 antagonists mentioned above can diminish harmful immune responses prompted by RVIs. In addition, inhibitors of cyclophilin, such as cyclosporine, can prevent inflammatory cytokine production and have shown activity against HCoVs [138, 139] . Development of more accurate measures of immune function would also be quite helpful in stratifying SOTRs at the highest risk of serious RVI or complications from RVI. Finally, the development of effective vaccines for RVIs is a high priority given the prevalence of these infections and their impact on immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals.",
