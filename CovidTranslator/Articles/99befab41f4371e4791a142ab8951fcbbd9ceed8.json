The outbreak was found to be caused by a coronavirus which was officially named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\" (SARS-CoV-2), and the disease caused by it was named 'COVID-19'. The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23 rd January 2020. With lessons learnt from the SARS epidemic in 2003 and the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009, Singapore was much better prepared to deal with the virus outbreak. The government has taken swift measures to contain and break the chain of transmission. Healthcare workers face the challenge of keeping patients and staff safe from the disease. There is a higher risk of mortality of COVID-19 in cancer patients and hence unique considerations for a radiation oncology department operating in an infectious disease outbreak. This article is the recommendations and adapted workflow from the two National Cancer Centres in Singapore with the endorsement by the working committee of the Chapter of Radiation Oncology, Academy of Medicine, Singapore. It highlights the challenges that radiation oncology departments in Singapore face and the appropriate recommended responses. This includes interventions, business continuity plans and workflow in managing a COVID-19 positive patient on radiotherapy.",

The first case in Singapore was confirmed on 23 rd January 2020. This was a 66-year-old Chinese male national from Wuhan. He had arrived in Singapore with his family on 20 th January 2020. Within a month, 89 new cases were reported in Singapore. As of 24 th March 2020, there have been 509 new cases of COVID-19 cases confirmed in Singapore with 2 deaths and 381,462 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed worldwide with 16,550 deaths in total. 1 With lessons learnt from the 2003 SARS epidemic and 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, Singapore was much better prepared to deal with the virus. 2, 3, 4 The Singapore government responded swiftly. Aggressive contact tracing was initiated for confirmed cases, and close contacts were quarantined for 14 days. A multi-ministry taskforce was also formed on 27 th January 2020 with the aim of coordinating national and international responses to the outbreak. 5 The outbreak was then declared a public health emergency of international concern on the 30 th January 2020 by the WHO. In Singapore, the risk assessment of the COVID-19 virus from Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) was raised from green to yellow on 23 rd January 2020, and from DORSCON yellow to orange on 7 th February 2020 (Supplementary Table) . 6 Multiple measures followed as the number of cases continued to increase in Singapore and worldwide. These measures included border restrictions on visitors arriving from Hubei, and on people who had travelled to China in the preceding 14 days. Thermal screening was implemented at immigration, and a 14 days mandatory leave of absence was implemented for Singapore residents returning from China. As the situation continued to escalate in multiple countries, broader border restrictions were placed on new visitors with recent travel history to countries heavily affected by COVID-19 7 . Singaporean residents and long-term pass holders returning from these countries were issued stay-home notices for 14 days upon their return. Individuals who are suspect patients are sent to the National Centre of Infectious Diseases (NCID) for further management.",

The radiation oncology departments may have to cover satellite centers, with staff working across multiple hospitals. This poses a risk of possible cross infection if a staff becomes infected. 5. Patients with fever should be isolated in a separate room. However, it is not practical to designate a dedicated linear accelerator, CT simulation room for patients at risk 6.
