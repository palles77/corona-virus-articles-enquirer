            "text": "Because of the significant sequence heterogeneity identified between the VP7 gene of KE135/2012 and KE528/2012, it seemed relevant to confirm the semiconductor sequencing results by using traditional sequencing. Therefore, the whole-genome segment encoding the VP7 gene was sequenced for both strains. cDNA production, amplification and Sanger sequencing were carried out with sequence specific primers (data not shown) designed based on the Ion Torrent sequence reads. The experimental protocol was essentially the same as described in the previous section describing the determination of genome segment termini. *The Muscle algorithm within the Translator X (1) online platform was used to obtain codon-based multiple alignments. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence alignments were visualized in GeneDoc (2), whereas sequence distances were calculated with the MEGA6 program using the P distance algorithm (3) . Results obtained by this method were used to calculate sequence identity values. \u2020The VP7 gene was sequenced for both RVI strains by traditional methods as well. Of note is that Ion Torrent and Sanger sequencing results were congruent. \u2021Assignment of the NSP4 was not possible by homology search. However, structure-based analysis identified putative helical transmembrane (site aa 47-64 and/or 71-88) and coiled coil region (site aa 142-168) and predicted a glycosylation site (motif, NGS; site aa 31).",

Reverse transcription was performed with 1 U AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), 400 \u03bcM dNTP mixture, and 1\u00d7 AMV RT buffer at 42\u00b0C for 45 min following a 5-min incubation at room temperature. Then, 5 \u03bcL cDNA was added to 45 \u03bcL PCR mixture to obtain a final volume of 50 \u03bcL and a concentration of 500 \u03bcM for the PCR primer, 200 \u03bcM for dNTP mixture, 1.5 mM for MgCl 2 , 1\u00d7 Taq DNA polymerase buffer, and 0.5 U for Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania). The reaction conditions consisted of an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplification (95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 48\u00b0C for 30 sec, 72\u00b0C for 2 min) and terminated at 72\u00b0C for 8 min.We subjected 0.1 \u03bcg of cDNA to enzymatic fragmentation and adaptor ligation (NEBNext Fast DNA Fragmentation & Library Prep Set for Ion Torrent kit, New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). The barcoded adaptors were retrieved from the Ion Xpress Barcode Adapters (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The resulting cDNA libraries were measured on an Qubit 2.0 device using the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). The emulsion PCR that produced clonally amplified libraries was carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol using the Ion PGM Template kit on an OneTouch v2 instrument. Enrichment of the templated beads (on an Ion One Touch ES machine) and further steps of presequencing setup were performed according to the Ipswich, MA, USA) and then incubated at 17\u00b0C for 16 h. Following the incubation, the RNA was extracted by using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). Binding of RNA to silica-gel column was performed in the presence of 150 \u03bcL QG buffer from the extraction kit and 180 \u03bcL isopropanol. All subsequent steps were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions.Five microliters ligated RNA was heat-denatured in the presence of 1 \u03bcL of 20 \u03bcM primer (PC2, which is complementary to the PC3 oligonucleotide ligated to the 3\u2032 end) at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and then placed on ice slurry. The reverse transcription mixture contained 14 \u03bcL nuclease free water, 6 \u03bcL 5\u00d7 First Strand Buffer, 1 \u03bcL of 10 \u03bcM dNTP mixture, 1 \u03bcL 0.1M dTT, 20 U RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania), and 300 U SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA). This mixture was added to the denatured ligated RNA and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 5 min and then 50\u00b0C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped min. The PCR products were visualized on 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, and bands of the expected sizes were excised and cleaned up with Geneaid Gel/PCR DNA fragments Extraction Kit (Geneaid, Taipei, Taiwan).",

To illustrate the sequencing results, an example is inserted below. The ligated oligonucleotide sequence at the 3\u2032 ends of the genomic RNA is shown with dark background. Please note that numbers above the peaks indicate the base position in the chromatogram and not the base position in the genome segment.Technical Appendix Figure 2 . Additional insight into the structure of the VP6 protein and its homotrimer form. The protein structure was generated with I-TASSER (1) by using the following experimentally determined templates (referring PDB ID codes): 1QHD (VP6, bovine RVA strain RF), 3KZ4 (VP6, bovine RVA strain UK), 3SMT (Human SET domain-containing protein3), 1B5Q (Polyamine oxidase from Zea mays), 1XPQ (Polyamine oxidase from yeast) and 1SEZ (Protoporphyrinogen IX oxidase from tobacco). A VP6 trimer was created from the generated VP6 model using the biologic assembly coordinate of the main template, the bovine RVA VP6 protein trimer (PDB ID: 1QHD). The model structures were refined with the Schr\u00f6dinger molecular modeling software package (2) to eliminate the steric conflicts between the protein side chain atoms. Pairwise protein sequence alignment was calculated with the NeedleP tool of the SRS bioinformatics software package. Electrostatic Page 8 of 11 potential maps were calculated with Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver (APBS) version 1.3 by using the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann method with a dielectric constant of 78 and 2 for the water solvent and protein core, respectively. The partial charges for the electrostatic potential calculations were calculated with PDB2PQR (3) (4) (5) . Molecular graphics and sequence alignment visualization were prepared by using VMD version identity values classify RVA-RVC rotaviruses into different G genotypes. Therefore, we tentatively assigned the 2 RVI strains into 2 different G types, G1 and G2 (see the main text). In the other genes, the RVI strains in our study most likely share the respective genotype specificity.Technical Appendix Figure 4 . Phylogenetic trees obtained for the partial sequences using unusual feline and otarine RV gene sequences. The alignments of the VP2, VP4, and VP6 proteins encompassed \u2248160, \u2248310, and \u224870 aa long sequences.",
