            "text": "The effect of corona discharge-generated air ions on the filtration of aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 was studied. A carbon-fiber ionizer was installed upstream of a medium-efficiency air filter to generate air ions, which were used to charge the virus aerosols and increase their filtration efficiency. After the virus aerosols were captured by the filter for a certain time interval, they were exposed to a newly incoming air ion flow. Captured virus particles were detached from the filter by sonication, and their antiviral efficiency due to air ions was calculated by counting the plaque-forming units. The antiviral efficiency increased with ion exposure time and ion concentration. When the concentration of positive air ions was 10 7 ions/cm 3 , the antiviral efficiencies were 46.1, 78.8, and 83.7% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. When the ionizer was operated in a bipolar mode, the number concentrations of positive and negative ions were 6.6\u00d710 6 and 3.4\u00d710 6 ions/cm 3 , respectively, and the antiviral efficiencies were 64.3, 89.1, and 97.4% with exposure times of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively. As a quantitative parameter for the performance evaluation of air ions, the susceptibility constant of bacteriophage MS2 to positive, negative, bipolar air ions was calculated as 5.5\u00d710 \u22123 , 5.4\u00d710 \u22123 and 9.5\u00d710 \u22123 , respectively. These susceptibility constants showed bipolar ion treatment was more effective about 1.7 times than unipolar ion treatment.",

            "text": "Particles of biological origin, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and pollen-as well as their fragments-that are present in air are referred to as bioaerosols. Bioaerosols can cause serious health hazards when they contaminate a human environment. The influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and the avian and swine flu are natural examples illustrating the profound, everyday impacts of bioaerosols on public health (Jung, Lee, & Kimet, 2009) . Virus particles are only nanometers in size, so they can remain suspended in the air long enough to be dispersed (Joe, Park, & Hwang, 2016) . Filtration is one of the most common methods for removing airborne particulates. It has been applied in various situations, including personal facepiece respirators and central heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings because it can achieve a high removal efficiency of aerosol particles. Fibrous filters are simple and economical devices capable of efficiently removing submicrometer particles (Wang & Otani, 2013; Sim, Park, Bae, & Jung, 2015) . Typical filters work using conventional mechanical mechanisms (i.e., impaction, interception, and diffusion). For improving the filtration efficiency and decreasing the pressure drop, electric fields are applied and/or charging particles are used.",

Grinshpun (2004, 2005) used facepiece respirator filters, and showed that the continuous emission of unipolar air ions by corona-ionizing air purifiers in the vicinity of a disposable half-mask respirator enhanced its protection characteristics against fine and ultrafine particles.

Lee, Hyun, and Hwang (2014) inactivated aerosolized Staphylococcus epidermidis using both positive and negative air ions simultaneously to achieve a higher inactivation efficiency. Many researchers have studied ionizers for inactivation of bioaerosols; however, the elimination of airborne viruses has not been considered. Huang et al.

The flow velocity was changed from 0.1 to 1.0 m/s. Isokinetic sampling probes were located at the front and back of the filter media for aerosol sampling. Two woven-wire stainless-steel mesh screens were installed immediately behind the filter and 10 mm ahead of the filter to apply an electric field across the filter. The thickness of the mesh screen and the opening area fraction were 0.3 mm and 69.9%, respectively. Compressed air was used as a carrier gas after oil droplets, moisture, and contamination particles were removed by a clean-air supply system, which consisted of an oil trap, a diffusion dryer, and high-efficiency particulate air filter. To aerosolize the virus particles, 0.1 mL of the virus solution was diluted with 50 mL of deionized water. The diluted virus solution was aerosolized with a Collison-type atomizer (9302, TSI Inc., USA). Dry clean air of 2 L/min formed a high-velocity jet through an orifice in the atomizer. The pressure drop caused by this jet drew the virus solution up through a tube. The solution was then broken into droplets by the high-velocity air jet. The resultant larger droplets impinged on an impactor, while the smaller droplets made no contact and formed an aerosol that exited through an outlet. The aerosolized viruses passed through a diffusion dryer for water removal and a neutralizer (Soft X-ray Charger 4530, HCT, Korea) to induce a Boltzmann charge distribution. Another portion of clean air was delivered to the test duct and mixed with the particle-laden air flow. The mixture flow rate was varied among 28.8, 48.0, and 96.0 L/min in order to achieve flow velocities of 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m/s, respectively.",

The positive unipolar air ions were generated from the carbon-fiber ionizer, and their concentration was maintained as 1.5\u00d710 7 #/cm 3 with different flow velocities. When the polarity of the ionizer was changed so that negative unipolar ions were generated, the ion concentration was adjusted to be the same as that for positive ions. The virus aerosols were charged, and the average particle charge numbers were determined using Eq. (9). The results are summarized in Fig. 4 . The average charge numbers were also obtained by the classical diffusion charging theory using Eqs. (10) and (11) Table 1 shows overall filtration efficiencies (experimental) determined using Eqs. (2) and (8). When both the ionizer and the external electric field were turned off, the filtration efficiencies were 56.5, 48.9, and 31.9% for flow velocities of 0.3, 0.5, and 1.0 m/s, respectively. When the ionizer was turned on, the virus particles were charged by air ions, and the filtration efficiency increased, e.g., to 63.5% for a flow velocity of 0.3 m/s. The application of an external electric field of 2 kV/cm further increased the filtration efficiency to 71.7%. For a higher flow velocity, the efficiency increased owing to the ionizer, and the electric-field strength decreased slightly. Table 1 also shows the theoretically calculated overall filtration efficiencies, which were obtained using Eqs. (3) and (8). The results show that the theories used in this study slightly underestimated the efficiency. Table 1 shows that the pressure drops were 13.3, 22.5, and 46.0 mm H 2 O for flow velocities of 0.3, 0.5, 1.0 m/s, respectively, regardless of whether the ionizers and stainless-steel mesh screens were installed.

For particles larger than 15 nm, the increments in the efficiency due to the air ions and electric field were clearly observed. However, for particles smaller than 15 nm, the increments of the efficiency were indistinguishable, as very small particles have low charge numbers and are thus difficult to be measured. Data analysis was performed for Fig. 5 using paired t-test with SPSS Statistics Version 23.

The results are plotted in Fig. 6 . Data analysis was performed using paired t-test with SPSS Statistics Version 23. Fig. 6 shows that the antiviral efficiency increased as the exposure time or the amount of air ions increased. The antiviral efficiencies of positive air ions with 10 7 ions/cm 3 concentration were 46.1, 78.8, and 83.7% for exposure times of 15, 30, and 45 min, respectively, while the efficiencies of negative air ions with the same concentration were 48.1, 77.6, and 82.3%. Therefore, the ion polarity did not affect the efficiency, for unipolar air ions (p > 0.05). Kim et al. (2011) studied the effect of air ions on the inactivation of bacteria (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus epidermidis) captured on a membrane filter. In their study, the antibacterial efficiency also increased when the ion concentration and exposure time increased. Fig. 6 also shows that the antiviral efficiency increased (p < 0.05) when positive and negative air ions existed together (using the Fig. 4 . Average charge number per particle with variation of duct velocity. Lee et al. (2014) performed an antibacterial test with air ions on aerosolized Staphylococcus epidermidis, which moved with a duct air flow. Their bipolar ion treatment affected the antibacterial efficiency, which increased as the number of charges in the ion polarity increased and the flow velocity decreased. Noyce and Hughes (2002) explained that electrostatic interactions with numerous charged groups in the cell wall could possibly induce a physiological change in the cell wall structure. Digel, Artmann, Nishikawa, Cook, Kurulgan, and Artmann (2005) reported that when negatively and positively charged ions were applied to test bacteria, after contact and sedimentation of the bipolar ions onto bacterial surfaces, hydroxyl radicals appeared in the cell wall as a result of chemical interactions between the positive ions and the negative ions. As a result of these reactions, the hydroxyl radicals damaged proteins and lipids (Nishikawa & Nojima, 2003) . While there have been reports on inactivation of airborne bacteria with ion emission, no report can be found on inactivation of airborne virus with ion emission, in open literatures. Instead of directly using ion emission, Wu et al. (2015) used atmospheric- pressure cold plasma to inactivate airborne bacteriophage MS2. They explained that reactive oxygen species such as atomic oxygen, hydroxyl radicals caused the inactivation. They also showed that plasma treated sample had more fragments than non-exposed sample with scanning electron microscope images. Fig. 6 also shows that the effect of an external electric field was not significant (p > 0.05). The electric-field strength used in this study was 2 kV/cm, but this value is far lower than that used by Yao et al. (2005) , who studied the inactivation of bacteria with variations in the electric-field strength, polarity, exposure time, and bacterial species. In their study, 90% of Pseudomonas fluorescens was inactivated when an electric field of 15 kV/cm was applied for 30 min or longer.",

When bipolar air ions were generated, the ozone concentration a little increased to 30 ppb. To study the effect of ozone on antiviral efficiency, we carried out additional experiments. After the ionizer was operated in a bipolar mode, all of the positive and negative air ions were eliminated using an ion trap with 20 V of applied voltage. Then the remaining ozone of 30 ppb concentration was carried by air flow to the test duct. When the virus particles captured in a filter were exposed to the ozone flow for 45 minutes, it was found that the antiviral efficiency of ozone was 4.52% which was much lower than that of bipolar ions (please remind that the antiviral efficiency was 96.4%, when the virus particles were exposed to both the ozone and bipolar ions for 45 minutes). De Mik and De Groot (1977) also observed that airborne phi X174 phage kept biological activity at an ozone concentration of 40 ppb and a contact time of 30 min. Fig. 7 shows the susceptibility constants of the MS2 virus to air ions. The susceptibility constants were 5.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 , 5.4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 9.5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 for positive ion treatment, negative ion treatment, and bipolar ion treatment, respectively. The susceptibility constants can be used to determine how many air ions are required to achieve a target antiviral efficiency. For 90% of inactivation, the required numbers of air ions for single MS2 virus were 418, 426, and 239 for positive ion treatment, negative ion treatment, and bipolar ion treatment, respectively.",

The antiviral efficiency with bipolar ions was higher than that with unipolar ions, but the electric field was not effective to inactivation.
