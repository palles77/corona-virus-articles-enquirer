The challengeable N 1 -functionalization of N-unsubstituted isatins into N-substituted (NS) isatins was realized through 10 mol % NHC and 10 mol % 1,8diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene catalysts within 10 min with up to 98% isolation yield. The subsequent MBH adducts of assynthesized NS-isatins (N 1 /C 3 -functionalization) was perfectly acquired in 10 mol % NHC and 10 mol % 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane catalysis within 30 min with superiority to C 3 /N 1 -functionalization (MBH/aza-Michael). For guiding the application to a versatile druggable isatin library, the NHC catalysis was compared with reported functionalization of isatins in view of green chemistry principles including solvent scoring of ACS GCI pharmaceutical roundtable, E-factor, atom economy, and so on.",

            "text": "Isatin is not only a privileged core structure of versatile natural products, but also a very useful starting material of indolecontaining biologically active molecules because of the presence of various functionalizable groups ( Figure 1 ). 1\u22126 Specifically, this potential has been realized in designing useful drug scaffolds for emerging targets (e.g., chymotrypsin-like protease, Nrf2) as well as well-known targets binding to neurotransmitters or their precursors (e.g., MAO, CB2). 7\u221210 However, when compared with the powerful utility of isatin, it seems that efficiently controlled introduction of functional groups into isatin has not been reported enough. Even though reactive isatins prefer nucleophilic additions at the C 3position, 11\u221217 the control of N 1 -and C 3 -functionalization has been tried by various synthetic strategies (N-alkylation, 18\u221221 N-acylation, 22 ,23 N-carbamoylation, 24 N-Mannich reaction, 25, 26 and aza-Michael addition reaction 27\u221234 ) . Despite reports, efficient chemoselective N 1 -functionalization of isatin is still difficult because of the undesired reactions resulting from the multifunctionality of isatins. The first undesired side reaction in the functionalization of isatins is the decomposition of isatins into isatinates. 35\u221237 The second undesired reaction is products resulting from the failure of the chemoselectivity (C 3 -vs N 1 -site). Any organic or inorganic base in an optimized method could not show consistent products in diverse isatin derivatives and electrophiles. For example, 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO)/ tetrabutylammonium bromide of catalytic amount could only be applicable to Schiff imine protection of isatins for aza-Michael product (N 1 -functionalization). 28 In N-unprotected isatins, DABCO is a more efficient base for Morita\u2212Baylis\u2212 Hillman (MBH) reaction (C 3 -functionalization) rather than aza-Michael reaction (N 1 -functionalization). 16, 17 Hence, surely C 3 -protecting groups of isatins (e.g. ketal, 18, 21 Schiff imine, 28\u221231 thioketal 32 ) have been developed. Notably, aza-Michael reaction of Kanger group's isatin Schiff imine are only applicable for fumarate derivatives as Michael acceptors, 28\u221230 and ketal/thioketal shows a loss of isatins as well as a high Efactor (low atom economy) through protection/reaction/ deprotection procedures (Supporting Information). 21, 32 Recently, aza-Michael addition of isatins without any C 3protecting group 27, 33, 34 made us to expect efficient direct N 1functionalization to be more considerable in view of green chemistry (E-factor, atom economy, and step economy). Kinetics of the saponification depend on the pH of reactions so that a stoichiometric inorganic base can result in the saponification of the aza-Michael products as well as isatins (Supporting Information). 27, 35 Aza-Michael reaction in imidazolium ionic liquids was applicable only for fumarate derivatives as Michael acceptors in spite of a high expenditure of the ionic liquid. 33 Remarkably, Pace group's N 1 -functionalization could show a powerful advance, but the recyclable KF\u2212Celite mediation required more than the stoichiometric amount as well as a long time reflux (ca. 12 h) for efficient aza-Michael reaction. 34 In this study, we investigated neither the stoichiometric condition nor the heating energy required for chemoselective N 1 -functionalization of isatins. Therefore, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) organocatalysis was a reasonable method based on (1) the extrapolated reactivity between activated olefins and NHCs from the literature 38\u221248 and (2) mild condition escaping saponification. 42, 43 The stabilized sp 2hybridized lone-pair electrons of NHCs make C2-carbene highly nucleophilic with the basicity (pK a : 20\u221228 in tetrahydrofuran (THF)) 51 and its precatalysts have the advantages (readily available, cheap, less toxic than metal catalysts, easy to synthesize, and recyclable) required for green catalysis. 42, 43 NHCs and imidazolium salts, conjugated acids of NHCs, can play powerful roles in Lewis/Br\u00f8nsted base catalysis, and can facilitate various reactive species (e.g. acyl anions, homoenolates, acylvinyl anions, and enolates) for synthesizing a versatile compound collection. 42\u221250 Although the concept of NHC-catalyzed Michael addition exists, 38\u221241 the scope of the nucleophile was limited to primary amines, 38 1,3-dicarbonyls, 39, 40 and thiols 41 but not for amides, especially not for isatins. Herein, we report the efficient NHCorganocatalyzed chemoselective aza-Michael addition of Nunsubstituted (NUS)-isatins for synthesizing N-substituted (NS)-isatins (N 1 -functionalization) in the absence of (1) a protecting group, (2) a stoichiometric reagent, and (3) heating energy. The usefulness of the aza-Michael adducts can be reinforced with the subsequent MBH reaction of assynthesized NS-isatins (N 1 /C 3 -functionalization) and the reverse synthesis (C 3 /N 1 -functionalization) to construct versatile isatins as a drug library.",

            "text": "Initially, the aza-Michael reaction of isatin 1a with methyl acrylate 2a (1:1.2 ratios) was investigated in the presence of 10 mol % of the organo-NHC precatalyst, 1,3-dimesitylimidazolium chloride (IMes\u00b7Cl), in combination with various organic and inorganic bases in different solvents to optimize the catalytic conditions. Acrylates were used in slight excess (1.2 equiv) because of their volatile nature. The detailed reaction conditions and results are presented in Table 1 . For the preliminary study, base condition of the reaction was investigated in the presence of the IMes\u00b7Cl precatalyst in the selected solvent, dichloromethane (entries 1\u22126). The intended roles of the inorganic/organic base are (a) to generate in situ organo-NHCs from IMes\u00b7Cl and (b) to assist the organo-NHC catalyst-directed path in the aza-Michael reaction. The combination of the IMes\u00b7Cl precatalyst with relatively mild inorganic/organic bases (Et 3 N or K 2 CO 3 or 1,8diazabicyclo [5.4 .0]undec-7-ene (DBU)) resulted in a highly chemoselective aza-Michael addition in dichloromethane (DCM) to produce NS-isatin 3aa as the sole product (entries 3\u22125). On the other hand, the combination of IMes\u00b7Cl with the strong bases KOt-Bu and NaH resulted in the formation of 3aa along with other unidentified products (entries 1 and 2). The best result was observed under the IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU condition with high chemoselectivity and the maximum yield of 81% (entry 5). Surprisingly, in contrast to other entries, IMes\u00b7Cl/ DABCO produced a MBH product from 1a and 2a (entry 6). Because DABCO is a weaker base than DBU in terms of pK a (pK a values of their conjugated acid in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO): Et 3 N\u2212H + pK a \u223c 18.82, DBU\u2212H + pK a \u223c 24.34, and DABCO\u2212H + pK a \u223c 8.9), 52 it is not sufficient for capturing the NH proton of isatin, but sufficient for mediating the MBH reaction. Under the optimal condition of entry 5, we also compared the catalytic efficacy of four well-known organo-NHC precatalysts (entries 5, 7\u22129) to prove that NHC catalysis can produce chemoselective aza-Michael adducts consistently.",

No considerable improvement was observed in the solvents MeOH, EtOH, CH 3 CN, and CHCl 3 in either the reaction time or the yield of 3aa (entries 10\u221213). In the case of the THF solvent, the IMes\u00b7Cl (A) is sparingly soluble in the solvent to present a very low yield (entry 14). At this juncture, we tried to add a catalytic amount of more polar solvent DMSO to the IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU system to improve the solubility and the reaction rate with the related reports of Arduengo and others. 53, 54 The white turbid THF solution containing IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU ( Figure 2a ) became a clear, light yellow solution immediately on the addition of DMSO ( Figure  2b ), which indicates the fast generation of in situ organo-NHC. A further quick change in color from yellow to wine red was observed upon successive addition of 1a after 2a (Figure 2c ,d) with the supposition on the proton loss (N\u2212H) of 1a during aza-Michael addition. Therefore, the click-type rapid chemoselective aza-Michael addition took place between 1a and 2a in less than 1 min at RT to provide a 93% yield of 3aa (entry 15).",

Concretely, the optimal reaction condition is applicable to a wide range of Michael acceptors like acrylonitrile 2d, phenyl vinyl sulfone 2e, methyl vinyl ketone 2f, methyl methacrylate 2g, ethyl 4-oxo-4phenyl-2-butenoate 2h, and ethyl crotonate 2i. However, when 2d and 2e were used as Michael acceptors, the same results were observed (like acrylates). When 2f was used as a Michael acceptor at RT, 1a was consumed completely, but the yield of the product was very low. After a number of unsuccessful attempts, we finally found that the aza-Michael addition with 2f would proceed smoothly at \u221210\u00b0C. We then conducted the reaction at \u221210\u00b0C, and changing the addition pattern of DMSO (along with isatin addition) improved the yield of 3af to 85% within 15 min. When methyl-substituted double-bond 2g and 2i were used as Michael acceptors, an increase in time and a trace amount of tryptanthrin 6a were detected. To our delight, in the absence of a Michael acceptor, the corresponding isatin was conveniently converted to the tryptanthrin 6a under the designated condition (Table 3 ).",

            "text": "In sequence, the catalytic suitability of the nucleophilic organo-NHCs was further examined for the MBH reaction of the as-synthesized aza-Michael products in Table 4 . To observe the N-substituent effect on the substrates, we selected (i) NS-isatin 3aa and (ii) NS-isatin 3ad with activated olefins (methyl acrylate 2a and acrylonitrile 2d), respectively, in the presence of IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU and IMes\u00b7Cl/DABCO precatalyst systems under various solvent conditions. Because in situ generation of free organo-NHC is very fast under the THF/ DMSO condition, it was supposed that acrylates undergo dimerization and other side reactions to result in a lower conversion and low yield ( Table 1, entries 18 and 19) . 55, 56 To escape the condition, MBH reactions were first tested in THF. In 10 mol % IMes\u00b7Cl/bases, DBU and DABCO deprotonated the IMes\u00b7Cl and generated the organo-NHC in situ. Although MBH reactions in the presence of IMes\u00b7Cl/DBU showed maximum conversion of the substrates by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) detection (entries 1 and 7), they could not produce a sole MBH product. On the other hand, the MBH reactions in the presence of IMes\u00b7Cl/DABCO showed clear and major MBH products to reveal the compatibility and suitability regardless of the N-substituent (entries 2, 8 and 9). When compared with the NHC catalytic condition, a catalytic base without NHC did not result in isolable quantities of MBH products in spite of the substrate consumption (entries 3 and 4). The increased equivalence of bases (30 mol %) could slightly enhance MBH products, but presented insufficient efficiency in both the reaction time and yield (entries 5 and 6). It is also emphasized in the literature that polar organic solvents or aqueous\u2212organic mixed-solvent media can accelerate the MBH reaction by activating the substrates through noncovalent bonding interactions, including hydrogen bonding and an increase of the equilibrium constant toward a zwitterionic intermediate; 57, 58 water or aqueous\u2212organic solvent media are also more promising solvent conditions for NHC-catalyzed reactions. 59\u221261 In this context, the MBH reaction was studied in pure 1,4-dioxane, CH 3 CN, MeOH, and DMF in the presence of IMes\u00b7Cl/DABCO (entries 10\u221213); however, no appreciable change was observed in the corresponding MBH product yields and reaction times. In light of the above patterns, the MBH reaction was further studied in various mixed aqueous\u2212organic solvent media (THF/H 2 O, MeOH/H 2 O, CH 3 CN/H 2 O, 1,4-dioxane/H 2 O, and DMF/H 2 O). To our delight, the mixed aqueous\u2212organic solvent media produced higher yields of MBH products than a single polar solvent (entries 14\u221219) . The 1,4-dioxane/H 2 O (1:1) conditions were the most promising and afforded an excellent yield of 97% within 5 min without purification by column chromatography (entry 17). The details of the derivatives of the MBH reaction in 1,4-dioxane/H 2 O have also been depicted in Table 5 (Route A). In addition, the optimal result did not require column chromatography, but needed only the removal of the NHC and DABCO with solvent washing and recrystallization with ethanol to give the desired pure products at an excellent yield.",

Now, this homoenolate I captures a proton from the conjugate acid (DBU\u2212H + ) of DBU 62 and forms intermediate III. Simultaneously, DBU captures the amine proton of isatin and triggers the chemoselective aza-Michael addition to form the NS-isatin. Under the optimized NHC/DABCO conditions, our plausible catalytic cycle proposed for the MBH reaction is described in path B (Scheme 2). The nucleophilic addition of acrylate with in situ-generated organo-NHC by the treatment of a DABCO base produced a zwitterionic homoenolate I, whereas this homoenolate I did not capture a proton from the conjugate acid (DABCO\u2212H + ) because of the low Lewis basicity of ",

Third, our method (within 15 min at ambient temperature) could show comparative advantage in energy consumption and accident prevention. Fourth, our catalysis condition showed an impressive difference in the loading amount and did not require a protecting group (additional protection/deprotection steps). With the mentioned merits, the most outstanding advantage of our methodology over the 13 reported methods in the factors of green chemistry was that only our method used a renewable catalyst between different batches (Supporting Information). 65 Finally, our method permitted efficient and environmentfriendly purification through simple recrystallization after the reaction.",

In particular, the respective roles of the solvent, base, and substituents on the substrates in optimizing both aza-Michael and MBH reactions were assessed. However, in the absence of the organo-NHC (DBU alone), the reaction lost chemoselective control, became sluggish, and produced a mixture of aza-Michael and Morita\u2212 Baylis\u2212Hillman (MBH) adducts. In addition, the optimal design of the two NHC-catalyzed reactions (aza-Michael/ MBH or MBH/aza-Michael as a compensatory reverse) made \"the sequenced introduction of two different three-carbon functionalities\" feasible. Our methodology can be applied to the synthesis of novel and distinctively N 1 -and C 3functionalized isatin libraries showing variations in steric and electronic properties; the salient features of this procedure are a short reaction time, good product yields, and that it does not require column chromatography for purification. In particular, MBH products are purified through simple recrystallization techniques with a high atom economy. It also is a very promising method in view of 12 factors of green chemistry.",
