Adults with CAP admitted from November 2009 to October 2010 were included. Demographics, comorbidities, severity and clinical features were recorded. Conventional microbiological methods included blood and sputum cultures, acute and convalescent serologic samples, and antigen urinary detection. New methods included multiplex PCR for Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis and 15 respiratory viruses. A total of 169 patients were included. Using conventional methods, we identified a pathogen in 51 % of cases. With PCR, up to 70 % of cases had an aetiological diagnosis. Fortyfive patients had BP (34 %), 22 had VP (17 %) and 25 (19 %) had co-infection (BP and VP). Pneumococci and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the most frequently identified pathogens. Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) median values were significantly higher in BP than in VP patients. Shaking chills, higher CURB score and shock were significantly more frequent in BP. A viral infection was identified in more than one-third of patients with CAP. Clinical and laboratory features could help to differentiate between VP and BP and to guide empirical therapy. A.

First and foremost, despite our best efforts and a detailed study protocol, a number of convalescent serum specimens were missed, thereby, potentially underestimating the number of cases of BP and potentially underestimating the number of co-infections. Second, we excluded patients without sputum because not obtaining specimens for conducting PCR tests was a study protocol violation. Third, we used a qualitative instead of quantitative PCR test. Finally, strictly speaking, a study on 'confirmed' VP would require lung tissue samples from all of the enrolled patients. However, while it may be a selection bias in the groups, VP and BP had distinctive clinical and laboratory features concordant with the aetiologic diagnosis, as to allow us to suspect a bacterial versus a viral cause.",
