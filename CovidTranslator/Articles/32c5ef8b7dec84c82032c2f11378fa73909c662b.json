Examples of inflammatory conditions that lead to increased melanin production include allergies, Malassezia dermatitis, bacterial pyoderma, dermatophytosis, demodecosis, scabies, and actinic and intertrigo dermatitis. Inflammation affecting hair follicles may lead to melanotrichia (e.g., sebaceous adenitis, panniculitis, vaccine reactions). Endocrine-hyperadrenocorticism, hypoadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, hyperestrogenism, and other sex hormone imbalances may result in diffuse hyperpigmentation. Papillomavirus associated-Pugs may be at risk for development of papillomavirus-associated, slightly raised, scaly, hyperpigmented macules and plaques in their groin region, abdomen, ventral thorax, and neck. Similar lesions are described in Miniature Schnauzers, American Staffordshire Terriers, and Pomeranians. May transform to squamous cell carcinoma. Pigmented tumors-apocrine cysts are bluish, cutaneous hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas appear red, dark purple, or bluish-black Melanomas, melanocytomas, and basal cell tumors are frequently black.
