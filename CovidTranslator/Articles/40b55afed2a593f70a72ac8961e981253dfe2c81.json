This study was designed to develop an experimental model of PWD using mcr-1-carrying shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) or enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), for the future evaluation of control measures. Three groups of eight piglets, kept in high biosecurity units, were orally inoculated with mcr-1-positive STEC or ETEC, and one unchallenged group was used as a control. Clinical signs were recorded. Regularly-collected fecal samples and samples obtained from the digestive tract of animals sacrificed one month after inoculation were cultured in selective media and isolates were characterized. Blood samples were used to genotype the polymorphisms of the pigs' intestinal receptors for F4 and F18 E. coli adhesins.",

However, fewer positive samples were obtained from the two pigs with the F4 resistant genotype. The three inoculated strains could be re-isolated up to the end of the experiment. Excretion peaked on the first week after inoculation with the O149-F4 ETEC strain, and later for the other two. An mcr-1 gene transfer to other commensal isolates was observed only for O139-F18 STEC, while the loss of mcr-1 from the inoculated strain occurred in all groups. The O149-F4 ETEC challenge may be used to evaluate alternative solutions to combat PWD caused by colistin-resistant E. coli in pigs. (I. Kempf). Veterinary Microbiology 226 (2018) 81-88 0378-1135/",

Indeed, different serogroups (O138, O139, O141, O149, O157\u2026), adhesive factors (F4 (K88), F8, AIDA, Eae\u2026), and other virulence factors (enterotoxins LT, STa, STb, EAST\u2026) have been reported in these strains (Fairbrother and Gyles, 2012) . The control of these infections must be based primarily on optimizing breeding management of the weaning piglets so as to avoid, insofar as possible, stressful conditions as they are separated from the sow, transported, mixed, placed in a new environment and provided with new feed. Prophylactic measures may also include vaccination of the sow (Rhouma et al., 2017a) . However, these measures may be ineffective in preventing digestive troubles, and in the past, orally administered antimicrobials were almost systematically used to control colibacillosis. As a result, E. coli strains have developed antimicrobial resistance, particularly to the most frequently administered molecules.",

            "text": "Of note, resistance to colistin (CST) had been detected at relatively low levels for years in commensal isolates, but prevalence was sometimes high for pathogenic strains (Kempf et al., 2016) , and after a publication on the emerging mcr-1 gene in China (Liu et al., 2016) , it soon appeared that this gene was also present in many other countries, particularly in pig E. coli strains (Kempf et al., 2016) . As these strains are frequently also resistant to many other antimicrobials (Delannoy et al., 2017) , it became necessary to develop and evaluate novel control products or measures. To our knowledge, experimental models of colibacillosis in piglets have been developed with inoculation of CST-susceptible E. coli (Madec et al., 2000; Rhouma et al., 2016 Rhouma et al., , 2017b but not with CSTresistant strains. However we believe that such models are needed to evaluate the impact or the efficacy of antimicrobials, including colistin, and alternative strategies on infections caused by strains with resistance or reduced susceptibilities to a number of molecules. Furthermore, it has been shown that acquisition and expression of the mcr-1 gene in a E. coli cell may result in gross morphological changes, including cell membrane impairment, and reduced fitness and attenuated virulence in a Galleria mellonella model. Moreover the mcr-1 mediated LPS modification reduces the stimulation of macrophages, and a lower production of IL-6 and TNF was induced with LPS extracted from mcr-1 strains compared to control LPS (Yang et al., 2017) . Thus because of these potential differences of susceptibility and virulence of mcr-1 strains, we decided to develop an experimental model of colibacillosis in weaned piglets using multi-drug-resistant E. coli strains isolated from clinical cases and carrying the mcr-1 gene.",

The polymorphism of muc4 was analyzed based on the test described by Rasschaert et al. (Rasschaert et al., 2007) to determine the F4ac/ab receptor status. Briefly, a fragment of the mucin 4 gene was amplified using Hemo Klen Taq polymerase (NEB, Evry, France) and digested with XbaI. The 367 bp amplified muc4 PCR fragment of the resistant allele is indigestible, unlike the susceptible allele. MUC13 was genotyped by PCR to detect the presence of amplicons of 151 bp (MUC13 A allele) and 83 pb (MUC13B allele) as described by Ren et al (Ren et al., 2012) . Susceptible animals usually carry at least one MUC13B allele.",

However, at necropsy-more than one month after inoculation-the O149:F4 + inoculated strain was less frequently isolated than the other two inoculated strains, both of type F18 + fimbriae. This may be related to the fact that susceptibility to F18 + or F4 + E. coli may vary with the pig's age. Verdonck et al. (Verdonck et al., 2002) previously observed a similar delay, with F4 + ETEC peak excretion 2 days post-infection (PI), but no excretion 7 days PI, in contrast to the peak excretion of F18 + VTEC infection observed between 3 and 5 days PI, and excretion persisting up to 9 days PI. Interestingly, in group G3, the only two pigs found to be genetically resistant to E. coli F4 had no diarrhea and gave only a total of eight positive fecal samples out of 26, whereas 47 out of 77 samples were positive for the six pigs which were genetically susceptible to E. coli F4 (P = 0.007); their mean log10 titer was 0.6 compared to a mean of 3.0 (P = 0.0004) for the other pigs in group G3. Although all the pigs were genetically susceptible to E. coli F18, the symptoms remained relatively moderate in groups G2 and G4. The experimental model could be improved by using higher inocula doses, intra-gastric inoculation, withdrawing feed before inoculation, cold stress, pretreatment with antibiotics, co-inoculation of viruses, or inoculating piglets when younger (Madec et al., 2000) , or using pigs known to be genetically susceptible to the inoculated strains. It is acknowledged that post-weaning digestive disorders are generally encountered in inadequate breeding conditions, contrary to the highstandard environment offered to our weaning piglets.",

            "text": "Using rifampicin-supplemented media, we could evaluate the recovery of the inoculated strain, and search for the possible loss of the mcr-1 gene from the inoculated strains. The use of colistin-supplemented media was used to try to detect the transfer of the mcr-1 gene from the inoculated strains to commensal ones. Detection of the mcr-1 gene in colistin-enrichment broths was also performed but the sensitivity of this method was poor as previously observed in experiments with pigs inoculated with a commensal mcr-1-positive E. coli strain (Mourand et al., 2018) , and needs further improvements. The three inoculated strains could be recovered from fecal and post-mortem samples up to four and five weeks respectively after inoculation. For group G4 only, a few isolates carrying the mcr-1 gene were also obtained, but their other characteristics (phylogenetic group, PFGE or ERIC-PCR profiles, and antimicrobial susceptibility) were different from those of the inoculated strain. As no mcr-1-containing E. coli was present in the non-inoculated animals, the uncharacteristic isolates are very probably commensal isolates having acquired the mcr-1 gene or plasmid from E. coli 13-220 M. Other analyses are necessary to determine the precise mechanisms of this transfer, which can occur through either conjugation or transposon mobilization. Interestingly, in vitro, the mcr-1 gene was shown to be on a conjugative plasmid in E. coli 13-220, but not in E. coli 12-246 or E. coli 12-269. The transconjugant obtained in vitro from E. coli 13-220 acquired resistance to colistin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Different studies have shown that the in vitro acquisition of an mcr-1-containing plasmid does not lead to a considerable fitness cost in E. coli as measured by growth kinetics, cytotoxicity, and virulence in a Galleria mellonella model (Tietgen et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2017) , but a high level of mcr-1 expression compromises growth rate, fitness, and the membrane's structural integrity while increasing cellular death (Yang et al., 2017) . In our experiment, most isolates from samples collected from the E. coli 13-220 M-inoculated pigs shared the characteristics of this strain, suggesting that the commensal strains which had acquired the mcr-1 gene were perhaps not as competitive as E. coli 13-220 M.",

            "text": "In the three inoculated groups, few of the isolates obtained were resistant to rifampicin, shared the phylogenetic group and PFGE profile of the inoculated strain but lacked the mcr-1 gene. Wu et al. (2018) studied the stability of various mcr-1-harboring plasmids and showed that the IncHI2, IncI2, IncX4 and IncY plasmids were maintained after 14 days of passage in a colistin-free medium, but the IncFII plasmid was lost from the E. coli DH5alpha transformant after day 5. The in vivo loss of the mcr-1 gene has already been detected for other strains (Mourand et al., 2018) . Interestingly, the loss of the mcr-1 gene was not accompanied by a loss of resistance to colistin for 12-246 M, suggesting that the previously described deletion in the PmrB protein, or other unnoticed mutations, probably played a role in colistin resistance. For E. coli 12-269 M, the isolates lacking mcr-1 were no longer resistant to colistin, trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin, suggesting that these resistance genes may be present on the same genetic element, but further analysis is needed to confirm this hypothesis, as the genes were present on contigs different from the mcr-1 contig. The loss of the colistin resistance consecutive to the absence of the mcr-1 gene also suggests that the previously detected PhoQ and PhoP mutations (Delannoy et al., 2017) have probably no impact on colistin resistance). Finally in group G4, the isolate lacking the mcr-1 gene had only lost colistin resistance.",
