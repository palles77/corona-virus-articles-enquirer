The positive control is tested 65with each test run. The assay was initiated by first removing growth media from the 96-66 well plates of cells. Then the test compound was applied in 0.1 ml volume to wells at 672X concentration. Virus, normally at <100 50% cell culture infectious doses (CCID 50 ) in 68 0.1 ml volume, was placed in those wells designated for virus infection.

The plates are then 72 stained with 0.011% neutral red for approximately two hours at 37 o C in a 5% CO 2 73 incubator. The neutral red medium was removed by complete aspiration, and the cells 74 rinsed 1X with phosphate buffered solution (PBS) to remove residual dye. PBS was 75 completely removed and the incorporated neutral red eluted with 50% Sorensen's 76 citrate buffer/50% ethanol for at least 30 minutes. The dye content in each well was 77 quantified using a 96-well spectrophotometer at 540 nm wavelength. The 50% effective 78 has in vitro activity against CHIK and MERS. We identified promising 84 micromolar activities for Tilorone against CHIK and MERS-CoV with reasonable 85 selectivity indexes (Table 1). The in vitro activity against MERS also agrees with recent 86 findings of others (5). These combined observations along with earlier descriptions of 87 many antiviral activities suggest tilorone is a potential broad-spectrum antiviral that may 88 have utility against additional coronaviruses. While this drug is approved in Russia 89 Federation countries, Tilorone has never been evaluated and tested for safety and 90 efficacy under studies that meet current ICH and FDA guidelines and regulations. 91 Recent virus outbreaks such as SARS-CoV-2 suggest the urgent need for 92 reassessment of this compound as a broad-spectrum antiviral as we have yet to fully 93 appreciate the utility of this drug discovered 50 years ago. 94 95 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 96",
