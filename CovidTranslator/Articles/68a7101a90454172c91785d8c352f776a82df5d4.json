Clinical Neuroscience, Center for Molecular Medicine, Stockholm, Sweden A number of cellular and molecular processes lead to pathogenic neuroinflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, pinpointing the interactions that are causing disease is challenging. Unbiased genetic approaches can define evolutionary conserved gene variants and pathways, which are crucial for disease pathogenesis. Nevertheless, during three decades of genetic research only a few risk genes have been identified. In recent years, marked progress has been made in human genetics of complex diseases. This included sequencing of the human genome, identification and cataloging of variation, development of high-throughput affordable typing methods and collection of large and well annotated case-control materials. Similarly to other complex diseases, this led to a robust identification of several dozen MS risk genes. Thus, a number of genetically regulated pathways that are emerging in MS, mainly involving immune response reactions, offer better understanding of disease pathogenesis, therapeutic targets and biomarkers.",

A number of genome-wide linkage scans identified over 50 genomic loci that regulate experimental neuroinflammation. Specially conducted crosses revealed further complexity involving gene-gene and gene-environment interactions as well as parent-of-origin effects. Recently, more advanced approaches have been that in addition to T cells, B-cell function and microglia activation as well as glutamate pathway are major players in the pathogenesis of MS. Moreover, the identification of antibodies against Aquaporin 4 in Neuromyelitis Optica is a good example how the identification of an antigen and the immune mediator can provide new understanding about the pathogenesis of CNS white matter autoimmunity.",

            "text": "Neuroimmunological research has provided robust evidence that neurons may be the target of an autoimmune attack and that in some instances antibodies against synaptic proteins are responsible for neurological syndromes that may or may not be associated with cancer (paraneoplastic). Limbic encephalitis (LE) is presently considered the model of autoimmune grey matter disorder. LE was initially described as a clinico-pathological entity characterized by an inflamma-tory process mainly involving the hippocampi and amygdala. At present, LE are divided in two broad categories depending on the target antigens. 1. Onconeural, including Hu, Ma2 , and other intracellular antigens not related with cancer including GAD or adenylate kinase 5. Pathological studies of these LE types usually show prominent brain infiltrates of T-cells and patients have a poor prognosis with bad response to immunotherapy. 2. Cell surface antigens of the synapse that include subunits of the glutamate receptors (NMDA and AMPA), GABA receptors, and a secreted synaptic protein LGI1 (previously coprecipitated with voltage-gated potassium channels). Unlike the LE of the first group, the antibodies against these antigens are patrhogenic and patients respond better to immunotherapy. Patients with anti-LGI1 are predominantly men that develop a non paraneoplastic LE. In contrast, patients with AMPA receptor antibodies are female and many develop lung or breast cancer. Patients with LE and GABA receptor antibodies also present in many cases an associated lung cancer. Of particular interest is the encephalitis associated with antibodies to extracellular epitopes of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor. Patients with this syndrome present with severe psychiatric symptoms, seizures, dyskinesias, autonomic instability and hypoventilation. This encephalitis with a profile different from LE suggests that probably there are other grey matter syndromes awaiting its characterization as autoimmune. Under physiological conditions astrocytes, the most abundant cell in the central nervous system (CNS), play critical roles in regulating CNS homeostasis, synapse formation and development and synaptic plasticity. However, following injury or disease astrocytes become reactive, an event often characterized by over expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and activation of transcription factors such as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) and the production of immunoregulatory molecules, such as cytokines, chemokines and reactive oxygen species. It is in this capacity that astrocytes form an important component of CNS innate immunity and play an important role in both neuro-recovery and neurodestruction. Using mice in which NF-kB has been selectively inactivated in GFAP expressing cells we investigated the contribution of astroglial-NF-B to CNS pathophysiology and functional recovery in models or spinal cord injury (SCI) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) . In this lecture, I will present evidence obtained from our group showing that inhibition of astroglial-NF-kB attenuates neuroinflammation, reduces neuropathology and improves functional recovery in models of SCI and EAE. We will discuss potential mechanisms of action and possible therapeutic implications of these studies.",

            "text": "The gp130 signal transduction protein is utilized by a family of cytokines including IL-6, LIF, CNTF and OSM. IL-6 binds membrane bound IL-6Ra or soluble (s)IL-6Ra and forms oligomers with gp130 activating the JAK/STAT1/STAT3 and SHP2/MAPK pathways. IL-6 is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders and is a potent activator of astroglia and microglia. There is limited understanding of how IL-6 communicates with different cells in the CNS and how the activation of individual gp130-coupled signal transduction pathways are regulated and mediate the actions of IL-6. Astroglia lack IL-6Ra but respond to IL-6/sIL-6Ra in a process termed trans-signaling. Microglia respond to IL-6 via both classical (IL-6/IL-6Ra) and trans-signaling. We found that IL-6 actions in the brain involve specific molecular and cellular responses that are dependent on trans-signaling. Further highlighting the importance of trans-signaling in mediating many of the CNS effects of IL-6 is the finding that inhibiting trans-signaling reduces the severity of neuroinflammatory disease induced by astrocyte-targeted IL-6 production. Downstream of gp130, the signaling intensity and kinetics of activation of the JAK/STAT and SHP2/MAPK pathways in response to IL-6 trans-signaling is similar in astrocytes and microglial cells. While gp130-JAK/STAT signaling drives increased expression of many STAT1 and STAT3-dependent genes, few genes are regulated in response to gp130-SHP2/MAPK signaling whose primary function is negative regulation of the gp130-JAK/STAT pathway via SOCS3. The role of gp130 signaling in the glial response to neuronal injury was determined in the facial nerve axotomy model (FNA) using mice with knock-in mutations that selectively disable either the JAK/STAT or the SHP2/MAPK pathway. These studies showed: (i) both pathways contribute to the early activation and accumulation of microglia in the injured facial nerve nucleus (FNN), and (ii) astrocyte GFAP expression is STAT3-dependent being markedly reduced in the absence of gp-130-JAK/STAT3 signaling. However, normal levels of glutamine synthetase and S100\u03b2 in the brain and FNN of gp130-JAK/STAT3 incompetent mice suggest that astrocyte development is not compromised nor crucially dependent on this pathway. In summary, the genetic dissection of IL-6 communication and gp130 signal transduction provides new insights into key mechanistic processes that control the functional plasticity of astroglia and microglia. vivo approaches. Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an antibody-mediated disease with considerable clinical and serological heterogeneity. Patients can be separated into several groups according to age at onset, HLA association, thymic pathology, and serology. Early onset MG (EOMG) is defined as b40 years at onset, is mainly females, with a high incidence of HLA-B8 DR3. Late onset MG (LOMG) is defined as N40 years at onset, and is increasingly recognised with a peak incidence in patients over the age of 70 years. The remaining 10% of patients have thymomas. Overall, the total numbers of LOMG exceed EOMG by about 3:1 with more males than females. In MG there are acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies in 80%, muscle specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies in up to 8% and \"low-affinity\" AChR antibodies in about 5%. IgG from patients with these different antibodies can passively transfer disease to mice, indicating their pathogenicity, and active immunisation is also effective. The MuSK patients often have severe bulbar symptoms and the reasons for this are not yet clear but the antibodies may act both pre and postsynaptically. The frequency of MuSK antibodies appears to differ with latitude suggesting an environmental influence. In the Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome there are antibodies to the voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC); and in acquired neuromyotonia antibodies to voltage-gated potassium (VGKC) channels.",

It has long been recognised that the local topography of glycolipids in the plasma membrane is critical to these recognition events, although the biological basis for this has been relatively under-investigated. Within the last five years, emerging evidence indicates that heterodimeric clusters of different glycolipids can form highly distinct and specific epitopes for antibody binding in human autoimmune neuropathy sera. These ganglioside and glycolipid complexes are comprised of a wide range of lipid partners, and can either dramatically enhance or equally well inhibit the binding of neuropathyassociated antibodies. This presentation will describe glycoarray methodology that allows for the rapid identification of the diversity of complexes that have been so far demonstrated. In living peripheral nerve plasma membranes, complex formation can be demonstrated that either enhances or inhibits antibody binding, and the subsequent pathophysiological events, this being demonstrated for GM1 in complex with GD1a. Potential mechanisms underlying these effects are considered, although much remains to be investigated and explained.

Results shown that PS did not induce significant alteration in the performance in the open field and in alternation task. A decrease in BNDF levels by Real-Time PCR was observed in hippocampus. Moreover BNDF and NT3 levels were decrease in lymphocytes. On the other hand these animals showed a poorer performance in the alternation test after exposure to chronic stress respect to normal animals. In addition an important decrease in BNDF levels in Clinical manifestations of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVL) are varied and related to organ dysfunction caused by the occlusion of small vessels.

The human retina, which in past years has been more and more accessible via new imaging technologies, is understood to be a \"window to the brain\" in that its molecular environment mimics that of brain tissue during pathological events. For this reason, we have used non-resonant near-infrared Raman spectroscopy to image several key molecules implicated in neuronal inflammation. We have isolated the Raman spectra of NADH and FAD, both Krebb's cycle metabolites and markers of cellular energy production; iNOS, a protein responsible for the creation of the cellular free radical nitric oxide; Lactate, a source of neuronal energy and a reporter of glucose metabolism in neurons; Cytochrome C, a protein implicated in mitochondrial function and triggering the apoptotic cascade; L-glutamate, a major factor in excitotoxicity; N-Acetyl-Aspartate, a neurotransmitter used as a marker of neuronal degradation; and AB-Crystallin a molecular chaperone that has shown to be upregulated in the early stages of MS and is thought to be a myelin antigen.

Serum levels of anti-EBNA-1 IgG were more elevated in MS than in OIND and NIND (p b 0.0001). Serum titers of anti-EBNA-1 IgG were inversely (p b 0.001) correlated with EDSS. An intrathecal IgG production of anti-VCA and anti-EBNA-1 IgG, as indicated by Antibody Index, was present only in a small proportion of MS and controls (range from 1.1 to 6.4%). EBV-specific CSF-restricted OCB were detected in 25/100 (25%) MS patients. Serum levels of anti-VCA IgG were greater in MS patients without than in those with EBV-specific CSF OCB.",

Seven healthy twins were EBV seronegative, but mixed results were obtained when these twin pairs were re-tested with other kits in different laboratories. The fine specificity experiments showed that patients and controls produced antibodies that recognized the glycine-alanine-rich portion of EBNA-1, as expected in EBV positive individuals. However, MS patients consistently responded to an additional sequence near the middle of the EBNA-1 protein, a region that is not antigenic in healthy EBV seropositive individuals.

Recent studies also suggest the chronic infection may be a cause of cryptogenic epilepsy and T. gondii infection has been suggested to be associated with schizophrenia and psychosis, suggesting the chronic infection may have neuropathological effects in immunocompetant hosts. An understanding of the cyst stage of the parasite in the brain is of importance to chronic Toxoplasma infection in the immunocompetant host.

Methods.32 children from 6 to 36 month of age with neurological disabilities of unknown cause and 50 controls sex/agematched were analyzed. CMV-specific IgG was determinate with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum/cerebrospinal fluid paired samples and the AI was quantified. Specific anti-CMVIgG was detected in 13 patients of control group and 20 patients suffering psychomotor retardation, since pathologic AI was also found in 15 patients with psychomotor retardation. Only, one patient from control group was positive to AI. Matched polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on filter paper used for biochemical screening that was kept from the neonatal period and AI data was available in 8 patients. PCR was simultaneously positive or negative in seven cases and only one patient belonged to a control group showing PCR positive with AI negative. The main clinical manifestations of the 15 patients with congenital infection were seizure (70%), chorioretinitis(28%), hepatosplenomegaly (20%) microcephaly and macrocephaly (20%). Conclusion: IgG-CMVAI should be considered as an important diagnostic tool to determinate if CMV infection is involved in patients suffer from psychomotor congenital impairment. Trypanosoma cruzi is a parasite protozoan able to colonize the central nervous system (CNS) and induce meningoencephalitis restricted to the acute phase of infection. Regardless the severe chronic myocarditis observed in one-third of the immunocompetent patients, the CNS inflammation and parasitism self-resolves in the chronic phase. However, in immunosuppressed patients the CNS is the major site of infection reactivation during the chronic infection leading to severe and, frequently, fatal meningoencephalitis. However, it remains unknown whether or not there are cognitive and behaviour alterations in T. cruzi infection. Several aspects of the CNS abnormalities detected in chagasic patients are replicated in T. cruzi-infected C3H/He mice. In this model the parasite infects glial cells, such as astrocyte and microglia, and provokes severe acute CD8-enriched meningoencephalitis paralleling parasitemia peak. Further, parasites are scarce and meningoencephalitis is absent in the chronic infection. In contrast, in C57BL/6 mice T. cruzi parasitism in the CNS self-resolves in the absence of inflammation. Herein, we analyzed cognitive deficits (learning and memory) and behaviour alterations (anxiety and depression) adopting infected mice that are resistant (C57BL/6) or susceptible (C3H/He) to T. cruzi-elicited meningoencephalitis. Several tests including open field (locomotor/anxiety), inhibitory avoidance shock and object recognition (memory) as well as tail suspension (depression) were performed. In contrast to susceptible mice, the resistant ones showed reduction in the numbers of crossings and the numbers of rearings during T. cruzi infection, indicating alterations in locomotor/exploratory activities. Neither difference between non-infected and infected nor between resistant and susceptible mice was demonstrated in the step-down latency of inhibitory avoidance shock test. However, T. cruzi-infected animals of both lineages presented similar time lapsing exploring familiar and novel objects, indicating an inability to form memory of this task. Interestingly, the tail Activin A (Act A), a member of the TGF-beta superfamily and multifunctional cytokine, is involved in the immune system and inflammatory response and has neuroprotective properties. Among other organs Act A can be found in the central nervous system and is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with meningitis. Act A is released by microglial cells upon stimulation with bacterial TLR-agonists and has been shown to modulate the release of NO and cytokines by microglial cells. We investigated whether Act A influences the phagocytosis of Escherichia coli K1, which can cause meningitis, by microglial cells.",

Under control conditions, no morphological difference of OX-42 immunoreactive microglia was observed between sham-operated (SHM), ADX, and ADX plus corticosterone (ADX+ CORT) rats. Exposure to acute stress induced morphological microglial activation most significantly in the ADX, followed by ADX+ CORT, and SHM rats.

Myelin tracts and individual oligodendrocytes were morphologically identifiable allowing for qualitative and quantitative analysis by microscopy and fluorescent signal patterns. We studied the direct effect of immune molecules on myelination including pro-inflammatory Th1 and Th17 cytokines (IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-17, IL-23, and GMCSF) and anti-inflammatory Th2 cytokines . Individual cytokines and cytokines in specific combinations readily induced cell death in slice cultures. Myelination was directly enhanced or inhibited by specific cytokines in slice cultures independent of overall cell viability. We next assayed the direct effects of cytokines on myelin de-and regeneration following a demyelinating insult. Demyelination indicated by a loss of GFP signal was induced in slice cultures by treatment with lysolecithin. De novo myelin formation was subsequently observed and returned to baseline levels over several days. Individual cytokines and cytokines in specific combinations were observed to inhibit or enhance myelin regeneration following the demyelinating insult.",

In this study, we examined the expression of glial GJ proteins in postmortem human brain tissue from MS patients and controls kindly provided by the UK MS Tissue Bank. Unfixed brain samples from 8 MS and 5 non-MS control brains were analyzed. Sections were characterized by immunostaining with antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) and microglia marker Iba-1. Sections included normal appearing cortex (NACx), normal appearing white matter (NAWM), and demyelinating lesions in the white matter and cortex of the brains. On average 15 images of NAWM and NACx from 5 different brain areas per case were evaluated in this study for microglia load to access the degree of inflammation. Expression of Cx32, Cx43 and Cx47 was analyzed by immunoblot and real time PCR. Results were controlled for age. Surprisingly, the expression of Cx32, which is the main GJ protein in large myelinated fibers was increased in MS NAWM compared to controls both by immunoblot and by real time PCR. In contrast, the expression of Cx43, which is the major astrocytic partner in oligodendrocyte-astrocyte GJs was markedly reduced in MS NAWM compared to controls.

Moreover, Real-Time PCR/microarray comparison of results, for several target genes identified, revealed an excellent correlation.

Further analysis should give us the means to identify possible links between those major pathways. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurodegenerative disease of young adults. Hallmark of MS is an autoimmune attack on oligodendrocytes, the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. This results in demyelination and ultimately causes neuronal degeneration. Remyelination, as one therapeutic strategy to ameliorate disease progress and restore neuronal function, requires the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), which are present in and around the MS-lesions. Surprisingly, anti-TNFa therapy, known to down regulate TNFR1 mediated inflammation and supposed to reduce the autoimmune attack on oligodendrocytes, causes an exacerbation of MS-symptoms. This may at least partially be due to impaired repair mechanisms involving TNFR2 activation, since remyelination is inhibited in cuprizone-treated TNF-receptor 2 (TNFR2) deficient mice.",

IL-6 has been demonstrated to have an important role in the development and malignant progression of astrocytomas by promoting angiogenesis, cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis and radiation. Control of expression levels of cytokines such as IL-6 is thus essential for retaining cell homeostasis and preventing malignant transformation. To guarantee their transient expression, all cytokines contain AU-rich elements (ARE's) in the 3\u2032 untranslated regions (3\u2032 UTR) of their mRNA's. These elements confer instability, ensuring rapid mRNA degradation after transcription. IL-6 mRNA contains six ARE's. In line with this, IL-6 has been described to have a short half life in several cell systems, varying from 30 to 50 minutes. Several extracellular stimuli have been described to have a stabilizing effect on IL-6 mRNA, among others IL-1 beta , IL-17 , TNF and IL-6 itself. It is has been proven in several systems that the kinase p38 is involved in IL-6 mRNA stabilization after IL-1 induction.

To identify the origin of VEGFR-3-expressing brain macrophages, we also examined the cellular localization of VEGFR-3 mRNA in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures subjected to ischemia-like oxygen-glucose deprivation. Most of the increase in VEGFR-3 expression in the ischemic core could be attributed to brain macrophages, whereas VEGFR-3 in the periinfarct region was predominantly expressed in reactive astrocytes. In the ischemic core, VEGFR-3 was induced in almost all brain macrophages, which were large, round, ameboid-like brain macrophages. By contrast, only a small proportion of microglial cells in the peri-infarct region expressed the receptor, and most VEGFR-3 and Iba1 doublelabeled cells were highly activated stellate microglial cells. A subpopulation of VEGFR-3-expressing brain macrophages was positive for NG2 proteoglycan and showed proliferative activity. In addition, in vitro model of stroke revealed no significant induction of VEGFR-3 in activated microglial cells, indicating that infiltrating exogenous macrophages expressed VEGFR-3 after focal ischemia.",

Trauma to mixed-function or pure motor nerves involves retrograde changes to motoneurons in the CNS, neuronal cell death, and inflammatory responses involving resident immune cells, microglia.

Activation of the KP leads to the generation of various kynurenine metabolites depending on the cell type. In the CNS, the kynurenic acid arm of the KP is present predominantly in astrocytes, whereas the 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) arm, which leads to the generation of 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid and quinolinic acid, is present exclusively in microglia. In addition to quinolinic acid (an NMDA receptor agonist), 3-HK and 3-HAA are also shown to be neurotoxins owing to their pro-oxidant activities. Based on these and other observations, the KP enzymes (kynurenine monooxygenase: KMO, for example) are being actively targeted for drug development for neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease. However, 3-HK and 3-HAA have also been shown to inhibit nitric oxide production and to ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalitis, suggesting a neuroprotective activity.",

EMMPRIN is a novel therapeutic target in MS to ameliorate neuroinflammation and pathology. Most of the present strategies for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are based on the modulation of immune response, but there is a lack of needed treatments to slow disease progression through inhibition of inflammatory and degenerative pathways within the CNS that result in demyelination, axonal damage and neuronal degeneration. Activated microglia plays a key role in the course of inflammatory demyelinating pathologies of central nervous system. Progressive forms of MS are intimately associated with the presence of reactive microglia and it is postulated that downregulating microglial/macrophage activation may delay or halt disease progression.",

The mRNA of mPGES-1 was upregulated at the onset and peak stages of EAE, followed by a decline to naive levels at remission, while no changes were seen in the mRNA of cPGES. The PGE2 receptors also exhibited marked changes in mRNA expression throughout the course of EAE. EP1, EP2, and EP4 mRNA levels were elevated at the onset of EAE and increased further at the peak stage, followed by decline to normal levels at the remission phase. No changes were seen in EP3 mRNA levels. Immunobloting revealed no change in EP1 at the protein level but increased expression of EP2 and EP3 receptors while EP4 protein expression decreased at onset, and was restored to normal levels at peak and remission. FACS analysis revealed that the EP2 and EP3 receptors were predominantly expressed in CD11b+/Gr1+ monocytes/neutrophils (~18%) and CD11b+/Gr1\u2212 macrophages/ microglia (27-29%).

Recent evidence indicates dysregulated expression of neuroimmune factors in the central nervous system (CNS) can contribute to the neural impairment associated with a variety of CNS conditions, including infection, injury, aging, drug abuse and neurodegenerative or psychiatric disorders. However, the role of specific neuroimmune factors in normal and abnormal CNS function is limited. In this study we investigated the CNS actions of two neuroimmune factors, the chemokine CCL2 (CC chemokine ligand 2, previously known as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 or MCP-1) and the cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6). Both neuroimmune factors are expressed in the normal CNS, in aging, and in CNS disorders. To identify CNS actions of CCL2 and IL-6 under conditions of chronic exposure, we have measured synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity in acutely isolated hippocampal slices from adult transgenic mice that exhibit elevated CNS expression of CCL2 (Huang et al., J.

This indicates that OSM expression is sufficient to induce several aspects characteristic of inflammatory CNS lesions. Next, we investigated how OSM affects the underlying disease processes in an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). When EAE was induced in mice with a local expression of OSM in the striatum, disease incidence and clinical symptoms were significantly reduced. In agreement with these findings, significantly less inflammatory lesions were detected in the spinal cord of OSM-treated mice. To explain how OSM can induce inflammatory lesions at the site of expression, while inhibiting development of EAE lesions, we hypothesized that the immune cells attracted to the site of OSM-expression may have a regulatory or immunosuppressive phenotype. Indeed, immunohistochemical staining revealed mannose receptor positive macrophages at the site of OSMexpression, a marker for alternatively activated macrophages.

However, inflammatory cytokine treatments increased the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on these cells, especially PD-L1 on astrocytes and microglia, and PD-L2 on HBECs. Blocking PD-L1 using specific siRNA expression in astrocytes led to a significant enhanced alloreactive CD8 T cell responses (proliferation and cytokine production) showing the capacity of human glial cells to modulate CD8 T cell responses via PD-Ls. Moreover, the expression of PD-L1 was analyzed using immunohistochemistry in post-mortem brain tissues from MS and controls.

Several reports have implicated Chlamydia pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae) as a causative factor for atherosclerosis and stroke. Limited data at present in India and no such data available on the association between C. pneumoniae infection and smoker with acute ischemic stroke. Objective: We investigate the role of C. pneumoniae antibodies in smokers with acute ischemic stroke. Methodology: This study was conducted at Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, a tertiary care hospital in south India; between January 2006 and December2008. Consecutive patients aged above 18 years with acute ischemic stroke who admitted within 72 hours of stroke onset were included. All patients underwent stroke work-up. Risk factors data were collected for all patients. We measured Creactive protein (CRP) levels and C. pneumoniae antibodies IgG and IgA by microimmunofluorescence technique (MIF) in all patients. Results: Out of 220 patients with acute ischemic stroke more than 18 age group smokers were 69( 31.4%) and nor-smoker were151 (68.6%). C. pneumoniae seropositivity found in 40(57.9%) smokers and 42 (27.8%) non-smokers (p b 0.0001). CRP was elevated in smokers compared to non-smokers (p b 0.0001). In smoker we did the multiple logistic regression test after adjustment for various risk factors like hypertension (odds 0.8; 95% CI: 0.44-1.71); diabetic mellitus (odds 1.3; 95% CI: 0.66-2.65); alcoholics (odds 1.3; 95% CI: 0.71-2.75; and C. pneumoniae seropositivity (odds 3.5; 95% CI: 2.15-7.15). After adjustment IgG antibodies (odds 8.5; 95% CI: 3.90-10.68) were more in smokers with stroke compared to IgA antibodies (odds 3.2; 95% CI: 1.28-8.06).",

We found that in the absence of TGFbRII signaling in myeloid cells, the chronic phase of EAE takes a more severe course and mice don't go into remission phase.

Microglia activation is not necessarily detrimental, as there are many beneficial microglia responses, such as the sequestering and removal of protein aggregates. However, activated microglia are the primary source of proinflammatory cytokines in the brain. Two proinflammatory cytokines that are elevated in AD, and believed to contribute to the neuronal damage, are IL-1beta and TNFalpha. The Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) p38 is one kinase pathway involved in the production of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha. The p38 family consists of at least four isoforms (p38alpha, beta, gamma, delta) encoded by separate genes, but the p38gamma and p38delta isoforms are not expressed at significant levels in the brain. Commercially available p38 inhibitors, which have been shown to inhibit IL-1beta and TNF-alpha biosynthesis, interact with both the p38alpha and p38beta isoforms, and the relative contributions of microglial p38alpha and p38beta to IL-1beta and TNF-alpha biosynthesis in response to various stimuli have not been addressed.",

The activating phenotype in microglia which expressed gp91phox and gp22phox was determined in microglial cell line BV-2 in the presence of gp91phox increased 24 h and 48 h in ipsilateral hemisphere of wild-type mice after CCI, and expressed mainly in ameboid-shaped Iba-1-positive microglial cells, but weakly in astrocytes and neurons. gp91phox\u2212/\u2212 mice had less contusion area and TUNEL positive cells than the wild-type one, and also suppressed superoxide radical (O2\u2212) and peroxynitrite metabolites. In the presence of IFN-gamma, BV-2 cells increased iNOS and NO levels which indicated classical activated phenotype and drastically increased gp91phox and p22phox (another subunit of NADPH oxidase), but not or decreased in the presence of gp91phox containing NADPH oxidase expressed in classically activated like microglia promotes ROS formation and has an important role on brain damages after TBI. Modulations of gp91phoxcontaining NADPH oxidase and gp91phox-derived ROS may provide a new therapeutic strategy to traumatic brain injury.",

Edelfosine is incorporated by cells and it acts on cellular membranes rather than DNA by selectively activating the cell death receptor Fas/CD95. Edelfosine is incorporated to effective intracellular concentrations by highly proliferating cells like activated immune cells and tumor cells. Our aim was to study the effect of edelfosine on the immune system in the context of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis.

Daily treatment by edelfosine reduced the mean EAE score of 2.9 in control animals (PBS administration) to 1.7 (10 mg/kg edelfosine administration) at EAE acute phase. Spinal cord immunohistological analysis at the acute phase of EAE revealed a reduced CD45+ as well as CD3+ cellular infiltration if mice were treated with edelfosine. Edelfosine treatment also led to a dose-dependent activation of caspase 3 in CD4+ and CD8+ cells. We found a significant difference between 10 mg/kg edelfosine and PBS treatment independent of the cell type (CD4+ and CD8+ cells) or tissue (lymph nodes and spleen) examined. Lymph node cells of edelfosinetreated mice retained their proliferative function upon restimulation ex vivo. Re-activation of cells with PLP139-151 resulted in an edelfosine dose-dependent proliferative response.

Those symptoms resolved partially after usage of intravenous steroids. Two months later she got severe neuropathic pain and allodynia all over the body with bilateral lower limb numbness which resolved partially after usage of intravenous steroids and oral pregabalin. Clinically she has ataxic paraparesis with brisk reflexes all over the body and bilateral lower limb hyposthesia and allodynia up to the level of D4, with Lhermit sign. Investigations: Cervicodorsal spine MRI showed a single and continuous spinal cord lesion extending from D4 to D12 with another 2 small ovoid cervical spine lesions which brain MRI showed 5 white matter demyelinating lesions in the brain, 4 of them disappeared after steroids. CSF Aquaporin 4 antibodies were negative as well as the CSF oligoclonal bands, with normal CSF IgG index. Visual evoked potentials showed delayed p100 response on the left eye. Somatosensory evoked potentials were normal. Conclusion: The patient has relapsing-remitting neurologic disease with MRI brain lesions suggestive of MS, but she has single continuous and gadolinium enhancing dorsal spine lesion extending from D4 to D12. The presence of such long spinal cord lesion is atypical for MS and it is suggestive of Devic Disease in spite of negative CSF Aquaporin 4 antibodies.This case highlights the challenges in diagnosing demyelintating diseases, which has important implication regarding patient prognosis and therapy.",

It was originally identified through its ability to cleave into a soluble form, TNF-a, a major immunomodulatory cytokine involved in central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). ADAM17 is also responsible for the shedding of several membrane-bound proteins involved in the pathogenesis of MS, including the TNF-a receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2, cell adhesion molecules and fractalkine. This suggests that ADAM17 may play a key role in these inflammatory demyelinating disorders. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that ADAM17 is expressed in the CNS in MS, particularly in active plaques and in white matter (WM) blood vessel endothelial cells, astrocytes and activated microglia. Our group has also demonstrated that ADAM17 expression is up-regulated in inflammatory macrophages, endothelial and astrocytic cells in spinal cord WM of rats with EAE.",

Its sole receptor, CX3CR1 is constitutively expressed in the CNS (microglia) and lymphocytes including monocytes/macrophages, dendritic cells, NK cells and cytotoxic/effector T cells. We have reported that anti-FKN mAb showed an inhibitory effect on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) models. Recently, we also demonstrated that anti-FKN mAb inhibited allodynia in EAE. In this study, we examined the mechanism of these inhibitory effects of anti-FKN mAb on both EAE symptoms and allodynia. Method: In the MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein)-induced EAE model, anti-FKN mAb (0.5 mg/mice) was administered every other day from 6 days after sensitization with MOG peptide. Allodynia was evaluated in a rat MBP-EAE model. Anti-CX3CR1 Ab was administered at 0.08 mg/site intrathecally at 23 days after sensitization of rats with myelin basic protein (MBP). Paw withdrawal threshold was evaluated by the von-Frey test. Result: To clarify the roles of CX3CR1 expressed in the CNS and peripheral lymphocytes, we established bone marrow transplanted (BMT) mice. WT, KO and BMT mice (WT to KO) showed EAE symptoms but BMT mice (KO to WT) did not. The administration of anti-FKN mAb ameliorated the EAE symptoms of WT and BMT mice (WT to KO) but did not affect those of KO mice. The effect of anti-FKN mAb on migration of lymphocytes in these WT, KO and BMT mice followed the same pattern as the EAE results. Regarding chronic pain in the EAE model, we established an allodynia model for the rat MBP-EAE model. In this model, the intrathecal administration of anti-CX3CR1 Ab clearly inhibited allodynia. To analyze the mechanism of this allodynia, immunohistochemical analysis of the spinal cord was performed. An elevation of mean intensity of OX-42 (CD11b) was observed. When anti-CX3CR1 Ab was administered, it inhibited this elevation at 6 h after injection of Ab. To study the effect of FKN on microglia, horizontal slices of L4 and L5 spinal cords from WT, KO and BMT mice were stimulated with FKN (50, 300 ng/ml). As the result, FKN induced the production of MCP-1 from the slices of WT and BMT mice (KO to WT). FKN/CX3CR1 pathway plays a key role in both EAE and EAE induced allodynia. Our results suggest that FKN/CX3CR1 is involved in EAE through migration of immune cells into the spinal cord, and in EAE-induced allodynia through microglia activation.",

Thus, we hypothesise that alpha-1,2mannosidase inhibition may affect DC by enhancing their priming capacity or/and perhaps diminishing their potential to induce immune regulation.

Among these, LYP/PTPN22 is a non receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase which actively controls T-cell activation: it is a negative regulator of the Src family kinases, which mediate TCR signaling.

In contrast with studies on northern European MG patients, which have an increased frequency of the T allele, we found an increase of the C allele.

To identify potential autoantigenic targets, human brain tissue was separated by 2D gel electrophoresis, blotted, and probed with the sera. Spots that were recognized by the positive sera from PwS, but not by control sera, were excised and the proteins identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionizationtime of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. One of the proteins frequently identified was neurofilament medium (NFM), a dopamine receptor interacting protein (DRIP). DRIPs are pivotally involved in regulating dopamine receptor signal transduction. Subsequently, sera from 110 PwS and 47 healthy controls were tested in ELISA against NFM. In addition, sera from 128 PwS and 106 healthy controls were tested for reactivity against an extracellular portion of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, which has previously been suggested to be a target of autoantibodies in schizophrenia. Over one quarter of PwS had significantly elevated levels of autoantibodies to one or both of these proteins, compared to b1% of unaffected individuals. A subgroup (15%) of PwS showed extremely high reactivity to NFM. We are currently investigating whether there are correlations between this strong NFM reactivity and specific clinical features.",

Similar trends were observed with respect to IL 6. A sexual dimorphism was found in the levels of IL 13 and IL 1a, with control females showing a significantly higher content of both cytokines when compared with control males. In females, the levels of IL 13 were significantly decreased by the high fat diet. The results indicate that cytokine plasma levels are modulated by both, a neonatal stress of maternal deprivation that appears to induce a long-term increase in at least some pro-inflammatory cytokines, and also by a diet with a high fat content.

Measures related to anxiety and emotionality such as number and duration of grooming or the presence of urination showed also a 2-fold increase in old animals as compared to adult mice. In the LPS-induced sickness behavior (measured as its locomotor effects during 30 min), both groups developed equal activity during the first minute of the test.

In the old group, the motor depressant effect lasted until the end on the test, while in the adult animals a recovery of both horizontal and vertical locomotor activities was experienced in the last 10 min interval.

Among that, there is growing evidence suggesting that the magnitude of cortisol awakening response (CAR), which is characterized by a profound increase of salivary cortisol after awakening, plausibly reflects the level of chronic stress, social stress, anxiety, etc. Such an elevation after awakening has also been reported in a variety of biomarkers. However, there is still a small number of studies in this field, little is known about the alternation of the magnitude of these biomarkers and its' relevance to CAR. We then investigated such awakening responses of cortisol and immunoglobulin A (IgA) at the start and at the end of two weeks of sleep tutorial; by which we anticipated that the tutorial would bring forth a positive affection with better sleep management, and also a result in an altered CAR, with illustrating the difference in such awakening response between endocrine and immune system.",

Our studies show that systemic blockade of IL7R alpha via neutralizing antibody after disease onset promoted a significant decrease in EAE severity and lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system, which was accompanied by an increase in the resident microglia population. Conversely, in vivo neutralization of IL7 did not show any protection from disease, despite the ability to inhibit IL7 function in vitro.

Early immunotherapy with plasma exchange, corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin's can result in clinical improvement correlating with a reduction or disappearance of NMDAR-Abs (Dalmau et al. 2008; Irani et al. 2010) .

Based on principal component and gene ontology analyses, predicted targets of dysregulated miRNAs were limited to specific biological functions including neurosteroid biosynthesis, which showed a targeting bias toward induced miRNAs (p b 0.05). The neurosteroid, allopregnanolone (ALLO), was suppressed in MS brains, which was complemented by diminished neurosteroid enzymatic machinery transcript and protein quantities in the same brain tissues (pb 0.05). Transduction of human astrocytes with select miRNAs suppressed enzyme expression responsible for ALLO synthesis (pb 0.05). Exposure of oligodendrocytes to nonimmunosuppressive ALLO protected them from the cytotoxic effects of activated macrophages (pb 0.05). Reduced ALLO and the enzymes responsible for its synthesis were observed in C57/Bl6 mice with MOG/ PTX-induced EAE (pb 0.05) together with induction of miRNA neurosteroid-specific enzymes. Treatment of EAE animals with ALLO diminished neuroinflammation, demyelination, axonal loss together and suppression of neurobehavioral abnormalities (pb 0.05). microRNA dysregulation potentially contributes to MS pathogenesis by altering neurosteroid expression leading to selective suppression of ALLO expression and ensuing adverse effects on oligodendrocyte viability. ALLO represents a plausible neuroreparative therapy for MS. The transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/ EBPbeta) and C/EBPdelta regulate the expression of some of the genes most often associated with deleterious effects of glial activation, i.e. NOS2, COX-2, TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6. If C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta regulate the expression of these genes in activated glial cells, the inhibition of C/EBPbeta and/or C/EBPdelta could result in an attenuated, less neurotoxic glial activation. To test this hypothesis we have undertaken a study with two aims: 1) to study the expression of C/EBPbeta and C/EBPdelta in glial activation 2) to analyze the effects of the inhibition/absence of C/EBPbeta or C/ EBPdelta in the proinflammatory and neurotoxic profiles of activated glial cells.",

To better understand these processes, it is important to study the mechanism of signaling in glial responses to injury. The glial response may involve cytokines, such as type I interferons (IFNa/\u03b2), which are known to regulate innate immune responses against viral infections. IFNa/\u03b2 signal through a receptor (IFNAR), which involves activation of STAT1/2 and interferon regulatory factor-9 (IRF9), leading to activation of interferon stimulated genes including IRF7.

In parallel, a high infiltration of CD3+ lymphocytes with a Th1 phenotype takes place from the first signs of symptomatology until peak. Coinciding with the beginning of clinical improvement, a high decrease in the number of Th1 cells occurred. This decline can be mediated by a mechanism of apoptosis induced by microglial cells with an immature dendritic cell phenotype. We cannot discard, however, that Th1 cells differentiate into other types of lymphocyte, because during the recovery there is not a reduction of the total numbers of lymphocytic cells. In fact, during the recovery phase we found an important increase in Th17 and T-reg cell populations. Also during this recovery phase, microglial cells remained highly activated and those found in the neighbouring areas of blood vessels displayed a CD1+, MHC-class I+, MHC-class II+, B7.1\u2212, and B7.2+ phenotypes.

During the onset of MS, pathogenic T cells, including IL-17 producing Th17 cells, invade the CNS and contribute to demyelination. Chemokines including chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 20 (CCL20), through its binding to CCR6, promote migration of T cells to sites of inflammation. Astrocytes have an important role in the regulation of inflammation within the CNS and astrocytes respond to a number of cytokines. Recently, we demonstrated that astrocytes express the IL-17 receptor and respond to IL-17 with enhancement of IL-6-induced signaling in an NF-kappaB and MAPKdependent fashion. During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), astrocytes produce CCL20; however the influence of IL-17 on astrocyte production of CCL20 is currently unknown.

This increase in CCL20 expression was not due to IL-17-induced mRNA stabilization. Instead, IL-17 increased the activation-associated phosphorylation of NF-kappaB; and inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway ablated IL-17/IL-6induced CCL20 expression. Additionally, chromatin IP (ChIP) revealed that stimulation of primary astrocytes with IL-17/IL-6 increased the recruitment of active NF-kappaB to the CCL20 promoter, increased p300 binding and histone acetylation, consistent with a transcriptionally active gene.

Our findings are clinically relevant and may provide a basis for development of novel therapeutic strategies in MS. Nitric oxide (NO) and the NO synthases (NOS) are present in a wide range of brain regions involved in the modulation of defensive and adaptative behaviours, including in the dorsal hippocampus. Recent evidence have suggested that systemic or hippocampal administration of non-selective NOS inhibitors causes anxiolyticand antidepressant-like effects in animal models. However, the NOS isoform involved in these effects is not clearly defined. Considering that mediators of the inflammatory response as well as upregulation of NO production can be induced by exposure to stress, the aim of the present study was to investigate the differential involvement of hippocampal inducible NOS isoform (iNOS) and neuronal NOS isoform (nNOS) in the modulation of defensive behaviors related to depression and anxiety, using the Forced Swimming Test (FST) and Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), respectively.",

Recent developments in molecular analysis techniques have enabled scientists to study tiny amounts of biochemical substances contained in a variety of secretory fluids, and it has been revealed that some hormones and immune substances elevate in the level against the short-term and acute experimental stressors. Therefore such substances could also be considered as possible biomarkers for human mental stress levels. However studies investigating the effect of chronic stress on these biomarkers frequently showed inconsistent results. Such a discrepancy might attribute to the difficulty in controlling a variety of background factors, duration, and strength of the chronic stress. We then focused on male university students who were engaged in their graduation examination. The graduation examination consists of a vital oral defense at the end, following six months of preparation. Thus the duration or at least the end point of the chronic stress level caused by the exam would be highly expected to be parallelly aligned with each of the other participants.",

However, the mechanisms linking EBV infection to brain pathology are still unknown. The possibility that EBV establishes a persistent infection in the CNS and reactivates periodically bolstering an immunopathological response has been explored by our and several other groups with contrasting results. In particular, inability to detect EBV nucleic acids in whole MS brain sections could be due to absence/low frequency of CNSinfiltrating B cells (the main viral reservoirs) and/or limited sensitivity of conventional real-time PCR techniques. Using brain sections from MS cases with established B-cell containing immune infiltrates (tissue samples obtained from the UK MS Tissue Bank) we confirm inability to detect EBV latency and lytic transcripts using conventional real-time RT-PCR whereas selective cDNA pre-amplification allowed to detect EBV latency transcripts in samples with the highest content of B cells, as assessed by CD19 mRNA level. To increase the sensitivity of our assay, we next applied laser capture microdissection in conjunction with real-time RT-PCR. Selective cDNA pre-amplification allowed to perform a quantitative analysis of cellular (CD19) and viral (LMP2A, EBNA1, and BZLF1) genes even if the amount of starting RNA was very small. With these optimized techniques, LMP2A and EBNA1 mRNAs were detected in all immune infiltrates analyzed (perivascular cuffs from active and chronic active white matter lesions, meningeal infiltrates and B-cell follicles) whereas BZLF1 mRNA was detected in acute lesions and B-cell follicles, thus confirming our previous immunohistochemical findings ( Serafini et al., J Exp Med 2007; 204:2899) .

It is generally assumed that astrocytic reactivity is secondary to the microglial one, despite rapidly accumulating evidence of the high capability of these cells for instantaneous and robust responses to changing conditions, as well as for communication with other central nervous system cell types. Therefore, in order to improve the mapping of effector pathways triggered in neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), we have investigated the timing and nature of astrocytic reactivity in relation to microglial reactivity in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) MS model. This was performed in the NOD/Lt mouse with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55 peptide as neuroantigen and evaluated by confocal microscopy, from pre-clinical stages. Astrocytic reactivity, as evidenced by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is observed from the time of earliest meningeal accumulation of inflammatory cells, extending across both grey and white matter and manifested by different morphological changes in the two compartments. It is most prominent around blood vessels and neuronal cell bodies. Quantification of GFAP shows a significant increase over controls. The above findings overlap, but are not identical with those of microglia. Coincident with the earliest parenchymal invasion, direct contact with T cells, identified by the marker CD3, can be seen. This occurs at least in two forms, firstly as interactions between T cells and astrocytic processes, as protrusions which appear to interlock and secondly, as intimate associations between cell bodies. In the latter case, 3-D reconstructions demonstrate that contact involves a substantial area of both cell bodies, where T cells become enfolded by astrocytes which undergo considerable morphological change. Current investigations address the question as to whether interactions between astrocytes and T cells are restricted to sampling of the environment as part of the homeostatic role of astrocytes, or are evidence of the formation of immunological synapses between these cell types, or both.",

The BBB is made of a network of tightly adherent endothelial cells (ECs) surrounded by astrocytic processes which provide factors that contribute to BBB maintenance. Several proteomic based-profiling of human and animal BBB endothelial cells revealed the presence of unique regulatory proteins involved in BBB physiology and transendothelial leukocyte migration. We and others found that human BBB-EC specialized membrane microdomains (lipid rafts) are enriched for proteins involved in cellular adhesion, cell structure, BBB development, immunity and defense, transport and trafficking and signal transduction. Our recent work, using animal models of MS and spinal cord contusion, as well as human in vitro, in situ and ex vivo analyses revealed that these new BBB candidate proteins, including ALCAM, the Hedgehog pathway, ninjurin-1 and MCAM are involved in the regulation of immune cell trafficking across vascular structures of the CNS. More importantly, while ALCAM-CD6 interactions regulate the trafficking of CD4 lymphocytes and monocytes-macrophages, it does not impact on the recruitment of CD8 lymphocytes. Conversely, expression of ninjurin-1 is restricted to the cells of the myeloid lineage and regulates the recruitment of monocytes and DCs to the CNS. Finally, MCAM (CD146) is expressed primarily on TH17 lymphocytes and is highly expressed within active MS and EAE lesions. Our recent data, based on proteomic analysis of human BBB-associated lipid raft membrane microdomains, identified novel adhesion molecules involved in the recruitment of specific immune cell subsets to the CNS.",

Recently it is described that ABC transporters may also be involved in removal of inflammatory agents from immune cells. In a variety of neuroinflammatory disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS), a defective function of the BBB has been described, based on structural differences. However, lowered expression of ABC transporters at the BBB may lead to enhanced exposure of the brain to inflammatory mediators, thereby aggravating the inflammatory process at the vasculature. Methods and results: We therefore set out to study the regulation of ABC transporters at the BBB in MS using our well-defined post-mortem patient material. Dominant loss of P-glycoprotein (P-gp: ABCB1) was detected in active MS lesions. Moreover, we have identified that the interaction of activated T-cells with brain endothelial cell cultures leads to a reduction of P-gp expression and function through regulation of the NF-kB signalling route (Kooij et al., J Autoimmun 2009). Our data therefore indicate that in MS not only at the structural level of the bloodbrain barrier alterations occur but that also the endothelial efflux barrier properties are affected, exposing the brain to higher levels of inflammatory agents.

Importantly, in vitro cultures of primary human astrocytes derived from MS lesions were found to have enhanced function of MRP-1 and P-gp compared to astrocytes isolated from non-neurological controls. In vitro data using human astrocytes further revealed that both efflux pumps are involved in the secretion of monocyte chemoattractive protein 1 (MCP-1/CCL-2), which was found to act as the leading chemoattractant for monocyte recruitment across the BBB. Blocking the activity of astrocytic ABC transporters reduced cellular migration across the BBB in vitro.

Repeated seizures can lead by unknown mechanisms to epilepsy, a chronic neurological disorder that affects 1 percent of the world population.

Our results show that seizures induce elevated expression of vascular adhesion molecules and enhanced leukocyte rolling and arrest in brain venules mediated by the leukocyte mucin Pselectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and integrins alpha4beta1 and alphaLbeta2. Interestingly, intravital microscopy studies show that Th1 and Th17, but not Th2, cells are preferentially adhere in inflamed brain venules after seizures, suggesting that adaptive immunity may have a role in epilepsy. Inhibition of leukocytevascular interactions either with blocking antibodies, or in mice genetically deficient in functional PSGL-1, dramatically reduces seizures and leads to a significant decrease in neuronal cell loss. Vascular leakage, which is known to enhance neuronal excitability, is induced by acute seizure activity and is prevented by blockade of leukocyte-vascular adhesion, suggesting a pathogenetic link between leukocyte-vascular interactions, vascular damage and seizure generation.",

Micro-wounds are produced either as para-cellular gaps resulting from endothelial contraction in response to inflammatory mediators (e.g., histamine and thrombin) or as either para-cellular gaps or trans-cellular pore generated during the diapedesis of inflammatory leukocytes. Mechanisms for pore/gap resolution (i.e., micro-wound healing) remain poorly characterized. Here we show for the first time that lamellipodium-like structures, which are formed explicitly on the ventral aspect of the endothelium, rapidly reseal pores/gaps and precede either pore constriction or re-annealing of adherence junctions. The leading edge of these novel ventral lamellipodia-like structures (VLS) exhibited strong enrichment of actin, cortactin, NADPH oxidase subunit p47phox and hydrogen peroxide. Small molecule and dominant negative constructs demonstrate that VLS require signaling by Rac, cortactin and to a lesser extent Cdc42, but not RhoA. Furthermore, Nox-specific inhibitors and ROS scavengers also robustly and reversible inhibited VLS formation. These findings define Rac1-and reactive oxygen species-dependent VLS activity as critical determinants for maintenance and recovery of endothelial integrity. Immunotherapy for high grade glioma (HGG) is an innovative treatment approach that entered into clinical practice with promising perspectives. Understanding of the mechanisms of the immune responsiveness will open strategies to improve the antitumor immunotherapeutic effects.

Since age-dependent outcome and chemosensitivity are linked to patterns of gene expression, we examined the role of anti-tumor T cells generally, and CD103 + CD8+ T cells in particular, in glioma gene expression and malignancy. We found that nascent CD103 + CD8+ T cell levels correlated inversely to the worst prognostic group (mesenchymal) of the 3 major subclasses of HGG, and that immune responsiveness in DC vaccinated patients abrogated age-dependent survival, a property conferred by a more favorable prognostic group (proneural). This raised the possibility that T cell activity might directionally alter subclass-specific gene expression in gliomas. Consistent with this, HGGs subjected to standard therapy up-regulated mesenchymal genes, whereas those subjected to DC vaccination up-regulated non-mesenchymal genes. In direct support of directional alteration of glioma gene expression by CD103 + CD8+ T cells, GL26, a murine HGG model, exhibited selective down-regulation of mesenchymal genes, immune resistance, and invasiveness upon exposure to wild-type but not CD103deficient T cells. This was linked to down-regulation of a subset of master transcriptional activators of mesenchymal genes in GL26. Moreover, proliferative subclass genes were up-regulated in GL26, as was chemosensitization, upon exposure to endogenous CD8+ T cells, whereas distinct genes and stem-like properties were enhanced upon exposure to vaccine-induced anti-tumor CD8+ T cells. Thus, favorable as well as potentially unfavorable changes in age-related gene expression and associated phenotypes were elicited by different strengths of anti-tumor T cells against gliomas. Further elucidation of the master regulators of such genetic programming should help optimize therapeutic synergy, enhance vaccine responsiveness, and increase benefits to HGG patients in the context of immunotherapy. Three distinct inflammatory myopathies are currently distinguished: dermatomyositis (DM), inclusion body myositis (IBM), and polymyositis (PM). The infiltrates in DM muscle contain B cells, plasma cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The pathogenetic mechanism of perimysial atrophy, the pathological hallmark of DM, remains controversial. One hypothesis assumes that endothelial antibody and/or immune complex deposition cause capillary injury, leading to perimysial atrophy. Another hypothesis is based on the observation that several type-1 interferon-induced genes, e.g., interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), are strongly upregulated in DM muscle, triggering a cascade of pathogenic changes. In IBM and PM, the mechanisms of muscle fiber injury seem to be different from DM. IBM is the most common inflammatory myopathy in adults, whereas \"pure\" PM is rare. In PM and especially IBM, clonally expanded, CD8-positive T cells invade nonnecrotic muscle fibers which strongly express MHC class I antigens.",

They are only apparently distinct process because as soon as the pathological process becomes chronic they have the tendency to become strictly interrelated. As such, primary neurodegeneration triggers a secondary inflammatory reaction while primary inflammatory reactions lead to neurodegenerative phenomena. Several molecular and cellular events sustaining intrinsic brain repair mechanismsoccurring within the CNS as a consequence of chronic inflammatory and/or degenerative processeshave been described so far. They can be divided into three distinct categories: inflammation-driven processes, CNS plasticity and neuro(glio)genesis. By one hand, humoral and cellular inflammatory components shift sense (function) over time from a tissue-damaging mode to a mode promoting tissue repair (e.g. neurotrophic support from inflammatory cells). By the other hand, the recruitment of alternative \"non-damaged\" functioning neuronal pathwaysoccurring mainly via axonal branching and synaptogenesistakes place as a consequence of brain damage. Whether or not (and to what extent) the recapitulation of precise developmental pathways underlies the whole phenomenon of brain plasticity is still a matter of investigation. Finally, endogenous neural stem/precursor cells (NPCs)the self-renewing and multipotent cells of the CNS capable of driving neurogenesis and gliogenesis in adult lifemay adapt targeted migration into damaged areas and promote repair via several mechanisms of action (e.g. neuro and gliogenesis, immunomodulation, and neuroprotection). Recent evidence suggests that these intrinsic repair mechanisms are only apparently distinct processes. Immunological, developmental and cellular events aiming at restoring tissue integrity within the CNS are strictly interrelated and NPCs are at the cross road of these interrelated phenomena. Understanding the relationship between repairing mechanisms and the reason why they fail over time in chronic CNS disorders, can be considered as a way of developing alternative therapeutic approaches promoting brain repair.",

MSCs have been shown to interact with cells of both the innate and the adaptive immunity and modulate their function. Upon intravenous administration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, MSC rapidly leave the blood flow and migrate into the lymph nodes and the injured central nervous system where they engraft for a short time and rapidly vanish. Despite this fast clearance from tissues, MSC administration induce an immediate state of immune tolerance and exert a significant neuroprotective effect promoting survival of damaged cells through paracrine mechanisms. This therapeutic plasticity is sustained by striking immunomodulatory, anti-oxidant, trophic and anti-apoptotic activities with no evidence of differentiation into neural cells.

            "text": "Background: For decades, the central nervous system (CNS) was viewed as an autonomous unit preserved behind a wall, and shielded from immune cells and from pathogens present in the circulation. Accordingly, the local inflammation seen in brain pathologies has been considered as a major contributor to disease progression, which should be mitigated. Therefore, the conundrum is that systemic antiinflammatory drugs fall short in most neurodegenerative diseases. Results: We found that the CNS is critically dependent on circulating immune cell support (provided by monocytes and self-reactive T cells) for its normal functioning and repair. Breakdown of the dialogue between the brain and circulating immune cells may occur at any level, starting from the immune cell composition in the circulation, the nature and the number of immune cells recruited cells to the borders of the CNS, the phenotypes acquired by the recruited cells, and their location and time of arrival within the CNS territory; defects in these processes can impact cognitive performance, resilience to stress, emergence of developmental neuropsychological disorders, onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases, and repair following acute injury. This concept unifies the role of immune cells in the healthy brain (as manifested by their function in supporting neurogenesis, expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factors, expression of growth factors, and of synapse-associated proteins), and under pathological conditions, as well as explaining their role in protective autoimmunity. We further propose, based on experimental evidence that the dialogue between the CNS tissue and the circulating immune cells occurs in the healthy brain in discrete compartments within the brain's territory, but not within the parenchyma, and is mediated by a selected subpopulation of circulating immune cells that operate under the control of the brain's milieu. Conclusions: These findings introduce new principles of brain immunology that were not hitherto acknowledged, call for re-definition of the brain as an immune privileged site, and suggest potential immune-based means of intervention in supporting recovery from injury, and coping with stress, depression, aging or neurodegenerative conditions.

MCP-1 is an important neuron-to-glia signaling molecule in the spinal cord after nerve injury. Intrathecal administration of MCP-1 (2.5 \u03bcg) evoked an increase of EB in the spinal parenchyma in naive animals, similar to that seen in animals at 3 days post-injury.

Our findings highlight the importance of inflammation in BSCB function and the potential consequences of BSCB disruption in the development of neuropathic pain. Cerebral microvascular endothelial cells (CMECs) constitute the physiological barrier of the central nervous system (CNS). A number of transmembrane proteins such as occludin and claudin-5 are integral constituents of tight junctions (TJs) in CMECs and restrict the free passage of molecules from blood to brain. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction as a result of alterations in the CMEC phenotype is a major hallmark of neuroinflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Cellular factors released by activated leukocytes and/or brain-resident cells (e.g. TNFa, IFNg) alter TJ organization leading to increased BBB permeability of CMECs and facilitate leukocyte infiltration into the CNS parenchyma. Here, we investigated the changes in the pattern of gene and microRNA (miR) expression induced by inflammatory stimuli in an immortalized human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line, hCMEC/D3. Transcriptome analysis was performed using an Illumina human v8 microarray. Under basal conditions,~11,000 transcripts were indentified in hCMEC/D3 cells. Treatment with TNFa and IFNg increased mRNA levels of 464 genes N2 fold, with the highest increases (N30 fold) observed for chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CCL8, CXCL8, CXCL9 and CXCL10) and adhesion molecules (VCAM1), and decreased mRNA levels of 242 genes N2 fold, many of them associated with regulation of TJs. Cytokine-induced changes in mRNA levels correlated with: 1) an increased endothelial permeability associated with decreased levels of occludin and claudin-5, and 2) an increased adhesion of the monocytic THP1 and the T cell Jurkat cell lines to hCMEC/D3 monolayers. We then hypothesised that miRs may be involved in the fine tuning of the brain endothelial inflammatory response.

Previous reports have shown that BBB dysfunction is associated with an upregulation of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) (selectins, integrins, and members of the immunoglobulin family) allowing the reciprocal attachment of blood-borne leukocytes to BBB endothelial cells (BBB-ECs), which is a crucial step for infiltrating cells.

The ability of these cells to adhere to hBBB-ECs and their velocity is assessed using the VolocityTM software. We have been able to corroborate the importance of ICAM-1/LFA-1 and VCAM-1/VLA-4 for the recruitment of CD4+ T lymphocytes across human BBB-ECs. We have further found a 50% increase in velocity and a 40% diminution in adhesion of T cells following blockade of the latter combination. In addition, we have explored the influence of new CAMs such as melanoma cell adhesion molecule (MCAM/CD146), activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM/CD166) as well as Ninjurin-1 for the adhesion and migration of CD4+ T lymphocytes and CD14+ monocyte across brain endothelium. Our data show a 38% increase in velocity and 34% reduction in adhesion of monocytes following ninjurin-1 steric inhibition. As for MCAM, preliminary data using antibody neutralization revealed a 16% increase in the velocity of human CD4+ T cells after 20 min under flow conditions.

Therefore, in addition to a direct attack on neuronal cells, brain-specific (auto) antibodies, can recruit and activate microglia through their activating FcR, resulting in a release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which induce neuronal damage. These observations have important implication for the use of therapeutic antibodies for example anti-Abeta, possibly explaining the side effects observed in animal models and clinical trials. It has been proposed that immune senescence, the age-associated restructuring changes of immune functions, participates in the rate of aging through modulating oxi-inflamm-aging. Moreover, age-related changes in the immune system can be biological age markers and predictors of longevity. Gender differences in oxidation status and immune functions have been observed in rats, with males showing higher oxidation and immune senescence than females of the same age. Estrogens are sex hormones that actively participate in modulating the mammalian immune function and, therefore, the age-related impairment of the immune response is drastically accelerated in females during the menopausal transition. Ovariectomy in rodents constitutes a good model for mimicking human estrogen loss and thus the menopausal situation. Recently, we have shown the deleterious effects of estrogen loss on several functions of leukocytes from immune organs in rats and mice. In addition, ovariectomized rats show similar levels in these immune functions to those in males. The aim of the present work was to study in mouse peritoneal macrophages and lymphocytes from old sham and ovariectomized females, as well as in males of the same age, several functions as well as inflammatory and oxidative stress parameters.",

The long-term prognosis of RRMS is, usually, unfavourable, since patients enter the so-called secondary progressive (SP) phase of the disease and accumulate irreversible neurological disability. A different disease pattern, primary progressive (PP) MS, is seen in patients showing a progressive course from the onset; an even rarer form of disease is called benign MS (BMS). In the latter case, there is absent or minimal neurological impairment many years after the disease onset. The course of RR-MS appears to be largely driven by the inflammatory process; conversely neurodegeneration, which at least in part develops independent from inflammation, drives chronic brain injury in patients with PP and SP-MS. Antiinflammatory therapies and immune modulation have shown a beneficial effect only in RR-MS patients.

Since every miRNA potentially regulates hundreds of target genes, we next used data on differentially expressed mRNAs from the same strains and the same tissue (Affymetrix), to elucidate miRNAs and their mRNA targets and pathways that are dysregulated in the susceptible strain. Solexa sequencing also enabled identification of several novel miRNAs which were all up-regulated in the resistant strain.",

Therefore, the understanding of inflammatory mechanisms leading to its activation becomes indispensable part of studies focusing on neurodegeneration. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is one of important transcription factors known to be associated with macrophage and microglial activation and is involved in mediating the upregulation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and other proinflammatory cytokines. However, inflammation is a complex event and co-activators and other transcription factors are known to play a key role in this process. Recently, Kruppel like factor 4 (Klf4), one of the zincfinger transcription factors was reported to play an important role in inflammation in peripheral macrophages where it was shown to regulate iNOS expression potentially by interacting with pNF-kappa B.

Quantitative analysis of the densities of immunoreactive glia (TNF-a and IL-6), neurofibrillary tangles (tau) and cored and noncored plaques (A-beta), and the proportion of neurons containing TNF-a, IL-6 and tau immunoreactivity was carried out. Stepwise logistic regression modelling showed that increased levels of soluble TNF-a and IL-6 reliably predicted a diagnosis of PS1 AD versus sporadic disease (R2 = 0.967, p b 0.001). Similar modelling of the tissue pathologies identified the proportion of TNF-a immunoreactive neurons as the most reliable factor differentiating sporadic from PS1 AD. Across groups, increased neuronal TNF-a immunoreactivity correlated with the densities of IL-6-and TNF-a-immunoreactive glia and neurofibrillary tangle stage. Importantly, these differences were unrelated to the density of A-beta plaque pathology.",

The clinician should mind a possibility of demyelinating disease in diagnostic approach to diffuse brainstem lesion, because differential diagnosis depending on MR imaging is limited and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to proper treatment. Inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) often lead to neurological deficits, such as paralysis and autonomic and cognitive dysfunctions. During the onset of inflammation the tissue is infiltrated by peripheral immune cells that may cause local tissue destruction. After the resolution of CNS inflammation, the ineffectiveness of inherent neuroprotective and repair mechanisms results in a wide-spread accumulation of degenerating axons. Later, in the disease course there may be loss of specific axonal tracts such as corticospinal tracts (CSTs) which control motor activity. At this point neurological disabilities become irreversible. Development of neuroprotective interventions that limit axonal loss is critical for a better prognosis and prevention of permanent neurological disability.",

Additionally, EAE induction in the absence of IFNg/IFNgR results in the induction of a set of neurological deficits, not typically observed in controls. These deficits include axial rotation, head tilting and balance impairments suggesting malfunctions in the vestibular system. This protective effect was previously attributed to inhibition in the generation of pathogenic Th17 cells by IFNg. However, our data show that the generation rates of Th17 cells in IFNg \u2212/\u2212 mice with EAE are only transiently higher than those of controls. Taken together, these data suggest that the beneficial effects of IFN may be exerted in the CNS by promoting neuroprotective mechanisms.

The degree of acute axonopathy in the spinal cord was revealed by SMI32 staining loss of CSTs by counting SMI312+ small diameter axons in the dorsal funiculus.

The inappropriate or chronic deployment of the inflammatory system can lead to a loss of its protective and reparative function and its emergence as a destructive force in pathogenic processes such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer's disease. In the CNS, the Notch pathway is implicated in many aspects of cellular development and functions. Recent studies have led to recognition of the role of Notch pathway in neurodegenerative diseases.

Because these cytokines are involved in autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, we asked whether TFM-celecoxib suppresses animal models of human autoimmune diseases. Methods: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunizing with MOG35-55-peptide (100 \u03bcg) in complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) containing mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra followed by pertussis toxin administration shortly after the immunization and 48 h later. To induce collageninduced arthritis (CIA), DBA1/J mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen (CII) (150 g) in CFA on day 0 and CII (150 g) in IFA on day 21. Antibody-induced arthritis (AIA) was induced in C57BL/6 mice by injecting anti-CII antibodies followed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration 2 days later. Mice received 10 \u03bcg/kg of TFM-celecoxib or celecoxib every other day from day 1 in EAE and AIA experiments, every day from day 21 in CIA experiments. The control animals were injected with the vehicle alone. Splenic dendritic cells (DCs) of mice treated with TFM-celecoxib or celecoxib 1 and 3 days earlier were stimulated by LPS in vitro. Results: Both TFM-celecoxib and celecoxib treatments suppressed the clinical features of EAE, and TFM-celecoxib treatment suppressed cell infiltration and demyelinization in the spinal cords compared to vehicle treatment. Although lymph node cells form TFM-celecoxib and celecoxib-treated mice produced less IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 when rechallenged by MOG in vitro, the inhibitory effects of TFM-celecoxib on recall responses were more potent than those of celecoxib. The severity of clinical and pathological features of CIA and AIA were reduced both in TFM-celecoxib and celecoxib groups. However, the TFM-celecoxib treatment showed stronger suppressive effects on arthritis, and this was more obvious in AIA. TFM-celecoxib treatment suppressed the LPS-induced production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-1\u03b1 by DCs compared to celecoxib or vehicle testament. This may explain the more profound disease inhibitory effects by TFM-celecoxib in AIA model. TFM-celecoxib possesses the ability to inhibit inflammatory disease models not only by decreasing the production of IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 by T cells, but also by suppressing inflammatory cytokines by innate immune cells. We have reported that the glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) inhibitor, lithium, is therapeutic in acute and relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and that relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) can be segregated into a T helper type 1 (Th1) disease or a T helper type 2 (Th17) disease.

We determined that lithium treatment is effective in attenuating EAE induced by Th1 encephalitogenic Tcells but not Th17 cells. Ex-vivo analysis (3H-Thymidine proliferation assay and ELISA) of MOG33-55-reactive Th17 cells indicated that they hyperproliferate and secrete more IL-17 in the presence of lithium. We recently identified a novel cooperative relationship between type 1 and type 2 interferons (IFNs) in the immunopathogenesis of EAE. Therefore to further dissect the mechanism of lithium's protection on EAE, we evaluated the development and progression of EAE in mice lacking IFN-a/b signals (IFN-aR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice), lacking IFN-g signals (IFN-gR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice) or lacking both IFN-a/b and IFN-g signals (IFN-aR1gR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice) treated with lithium at the onset of disease, compared to untreated mice. We found that lithium administered after onset of clinical disease equally suppressed EAE in IFN-aR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, IFN-aR1gR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice and wild type mice. In contrast, in IFN-gR1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, while lithium reduced partially the severity during the initiation phase of EAE, it was completely ineffective in the chronic/effector/ progressive phase of the disease.",

Importantly, lithium, a selective inhibitor of GSK3, suppresses chronic/progressive EAE by IFN-g mediated signals, and is not able to suppress Th17 disease in mice. This finding has crucial implications for identifying what type of MS patients will mostly benefit from GSK3-targeted therapy. Encapsulation into polyethylene-glycol-coated long-circulating liposomes is a strategy to increase efficacy and alter the therapeutic profile of pharmaceutically active drugs. Recent work demonstrated that this approach is also promising for glucocorticoids (GCs), the mainstay in the treatment of acute relapses in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. Here we have used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) to explore the mechanisms that may account for the superior therapeutic efficacy of liposomal GCs as compared to free compounds.",

Nevertheless, both drug preparations similarly act through the classical cytosolic GC receptor (GR) as shown by the use of GR knockout mice. Interestingly, conditional mutagenesis of the GR demonstrated that modulation of T cell function is no stringent prerequisite for therapeutic efficacy of liposomal GCs. These findings contrast to our previous observations that peripheral T cells are essential targets of free dexamethasone. Further analysis revealed that major features of macrophage function such as cytokine and chemokine expression, NO production and MHC class II surface levels are strongly affected by liposomal GCs. Consequently, specific deletion of the GR in myeloid cells also partially impaired EAE therapy by liposome-encapsulated, but not by free GCs. Liposome-encapsulated GCs had similar side effects on certain parameters of liver metabolism as compared to higher doses of free GCs, indicating that the new formulation may not reduce all adverse effects of GC therapy.",

Results and discussion: In the study of the clinical efficacy, neurological examination and symptoms were improved earlier the combination therapy than IAPP therapy only. In the study of the changes of serum cytokines, serum level of IL-10 has increased immediately just after IAPP therapy only, and then has decreased just after IVMP treatment.

Further research will keep elucidating its possible immunotherapeutic use in therapies of autoimmune diseases. Universty of Foggia, Foggia, Italy; 2 University of Bari, Bari, Italy Background: ATP and its cognate receptors are involved in the inflammatory process. In particular, the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) is thought to play an important role in macrophage/ microglial function by regulating cytokine production and apoptosis. P2X7R is known to be upregulated during inflammation and antagonists of this receptor may serve as novel anti-inflammatory agents. Experimental evidences show that P2X7R is certainly involved in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) pathology. Aims: To investigate the expression of P2X7R, IL-1beta and ectoapyrase CD39 on peripheral blood monocytes of MS patients and to see whether Glatiramer Acetate (GA) therapeutic effects in MS may be possibly mediated by mechanisms interfering with the ATP/P2X7R interaction and hence with the induction of IL-1beta or with the ATP activity modulating CD39. Patients and methods: Twelve RR and treatment-free MS patients have been selected and peripheral blood monocytes have been obtained. The expression of P2X7R, IL-1beta and CD39 on monocytes has been investigated by qrt-PCR. Thereafter, the in vitro effects of GA on the expression of P2X7R, IL-1beta and CD39 of BzATP (the most potent P2X7R agonist) stimulated-monocytes have been evaluated. Monocytes, without and with GA conditioning, were finally checked for Bax and Bcl-2 expression (qrt-PCR) in order to rule out apoptosis processes. Ten healthy donors (HDs) were similarly investigated. Results: No actual differences were found in P2X7R, IL-1beta and CD39 expression between patients and controls. In MS Bz-ATP stimulatedmonocytes, GA conditioning was clearly able to downregulate (p = 0.003) P2X7R expression but also IL-1beta expression even if the difference did not reach a statistical significance. Conversely, CD39 expression showed a trend (p = 0.06) to increase. Similarly, in HDs P2X7R (p = 0.01) and IL-1beta (p = 0.03) were downregulated by GA, whereas CD39 showed an upregulation even if not statistically significant. Moreover pro-apoptotic Bax vs. anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 ratio expression on monocytes was not modified by GA conditioning either in MS or HDs. Conclusions: Monocytes either from MS or controls express P2X7R, together with IL-1beta and CD39. GA immune modulation seems to interfere with the P2X7R but also with IL-1beta and CD39 expression on monocytes of both patients and controls. No apoptotic phenomena are induced on cultured monocytes by GA conditioning, therefore the observed changes seem to represent a GA net effect. Preclinical studies in animal models demonstrate cholesterollowering statins promote immune modulation, and may be beneficial in treatment of autoimmune diseases. Clinical trial data suggest that treatment with a statin can reduce the risk for developing new brain lesions in patients with CNS demyelinating disease. While all statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, it is known that their binding affinities and pharmacokinetic properties differ, which influences their potency in treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Therefore, it is possible that the immunodulatory potential of statins differ, and only certain statins may be beneficial in treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Our goal was to examine the relative potency of individual statins in EAE treatment and compare their capability to modulate T cell signaling and differentiation.",

We investigated whether resveratrol could be therapeutic for multiple sclerosis (MS) using animal models for MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD).",

After transduction, total BMC and both myeloid cell subpopulations suppressed the proliferative T cell response in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, we found that the monocyte-like cells were significantly more suppressive than their granulocyte-like counterparts, and that suppression was also significantly higher if the cells were transduced with the autoantigen than with a control vector (in all cell subpopulations), which suggest that both non-specific and antigen-specific mechanisms contribute to the suppressive effect observed in vitro.

Treatment strategies aim to affect the CNS by reducing the inflammation and inducing neuroprotective repair processes. T-cells that produce IL-17 (Th17) are major contributors to the pathogenesis, whereas regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play a role in the suppression of autoimmunity. The therapeutic effect of Glatiramer acetate (GA, Copaxone\u00e2) has been attributed to immunomodulation from inflammatory towards anti-inflammatory pathway. Objective: to identify cell populations relevant to pathogenesis and repair within the injured CNS, and explore whether immunomodulatory treatment can lead to neuroprotection in situ. Methods: Daily injection of GA was initiated following disease induction or after disease development, in two EAE models: relapsing-remitting PLP-and chronic MOG-induced EAE. Th17 and Tregs were identified by their IL-17 and Foxp3 expression, respectively. Their incidence within the CNS and localization in injury sites was analyzed. The proliferation marker BrdU was injected concurrently with GA and its incorporation into progenitor cells expressing various developmental markers was detected. Neuronal and myelin damages were identified using electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Results: In the CNS of mice with either relapsing-remitting or chronic EAE, T-cells and activated microglia expressed IL-17, with apparent localization within regions of myelin loss. In GA treated mice CNS inflammation and Th-17 occurrence were drastically reduced, with parallel elevation in Tregs, indicating the immunomodulatory consequences of GA treatment in situ. Furthermore, GA treatment resulted in reduction of neuronal and myelin damages and augmented the three processes characteristic of neurogenesis-neuronal proliferation, migration and differentiation. The newborn neurons migrated through existing and dormant pathways, into injury sites in brain regions which do not normally undergo neurogenesis, and differentiated to mature neuronal phenotype. GA treatment induced also proliferation and differentiation towards the oligodendrocyte lineage.",

Despite evidence supported the idea that MS is a T cell-mediated autoimmune disease, the involvement of autoantigenspecific regulatory and effector T lymphocytes is not fully understood and remain to be established. Objectives: To assess the dynamics of autorreactive effector (Teff) and regulatory T (Treg) lymphocytes during the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis, and also made a screening about the balance between both populations. Methods: We induced EAE in C57BL/6 (IA b) and performed quantitative analysis using MOG35-55/IAb (MHC class II) tetramers. Tetramers were used to track autoantigen-specific regulatory (CD4+ CD25high) and effector T cells (CD4+CD45RO+CD69+) during the disease. Detection and characterization of antigen-specific T cells was realized in spleen, lymphatic nodes, peripheral blood and CNS tissue during the progression of EAE and analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: We observed the increase of both populations Teff and Treg specific for MOG after the induction of the disease. We are currently performing the analysis of both populations in the brain tissue. In addition we observed a subpopulation of CD4-cells crossreacting with the MOG tetramer that is going to be further characterized.",

EGTA, which inhibits the degranulation of NK cells, had more than 80% blocking effects, while Z-VAD-FMK, which is pan-caspase inhibitor, had only 20% blocking effects on the killing.

Quantitatively, Gzm K, which was almost completely absent in activated CD4+ T cells had highest fold increase.

A protective role for IFN-g in limiting CNS neutrophil recruitment was supported by rapid lethality associated with massive CNS neutrophil infiltration in wt/GKO CD4 T cell recipients treated with anti-IFN-g. Surprisingly however, WT recipients treated with anti-IFN-g were spared from accelerated mortality despite substantial CNS neutrophil infiltration. Analysis of IL-17 expression in the CNS suggested that rapid fatal disease outcome was only observed in IFN-g deficient recipients that expressed IL-17 mRNA.

Finally, the lesion dies leaving a hypocellular scar-like inactive lesion. Still, the most intriguing issue remains the question how MS lesions really start. The earliest pathological sign of damage in MS are clusters of activated microglia in normalappearing white matter that we have termed preactive lesions. Given the frequency of preactive lesions we suggest that most probably spontaneously resolve, without progressing to an active demyelinating stage. Microglia activation at this stage may therefore reflect immune-regulatory or immune-suppressive rather than pro-inflammatory activity. The goal is to examine how preactive lesions arise.",

Mannose-binding lectin (MBL), which recognizes sugar structures such as mannose and N-acetyl-glucosamine on the surface of pathogens and activates the complement system, has been reported to be related with severity of GBS. Objective: To elucidate the roles of MBL in pathogenesis and exacerbation of GBS, we investigated chronological change of serum MBL concentration especially in early period of neurological onset. Methods: Peripheral blood samples were serially obtained from 12 patients with the IgG anti-GQ1b antibody-positive variant of GBS: 10 with Miller-Fisher syndrome and 2 with GBS with ophthalmoplegia. Serum MBL concentration was determined by ELISA using mannan as the ligand. Results: Patients had wide-ranging serum MBL concentration. In the study on serial samples, the MBL concentration reached its peak around the same time as the bottom of clinical symptoms, and then decreased in four patients. One patient had the peak of the MBL concentration at neurological onset. In two patients who were measured for only a symptomatic worsening phase, the MBL concentration increased. The MBL concentration increased gradually and then decreased over the 15 disease days in a case taking the most severe clinical course, in whom the point of nadir was unclear. In the other two cases, the MBL concentrations were unchanged throughout the clinical course. Conclusions: In the serial study, the chronological change of the MBL concentration showed a similar tendency. The MBL concentration level increased during clinical exacerbation and reached a maximum level just around the bottom of clinical symptoms, and then decreased gradually. These results suggest that complement activation mediated by MBL could be associated with pathological condition of GBS, especially extent of nerve damage. MBL might be another target point for therapeutic approach to prevent the progression of the disease.",

Remarkably, mice lacking the receptors to both IFN-a/b and IFN-g (IFN-a/b/gR \u2212/\u2212 ) developed a milder form of EAE. From these results we inferred (1) that IFN-g is disease promoting during induction phase but protective during the chronic phase and, (2) type I IFN-activity in the absence of IFN-g signaling exacerbates disease. In order to directly test for the opposing activity of IFN-g in EAE, WT mice were injected with recombinant IFNg (rIFN-g) daily for 10 days starting after induction of disease or after onset of disease symptoms. IFN-g treatment during the induction phase worsened disease, and remarkably, treatment after onset of clinical symptoms completely suppressed disease progression. The suppressive effect of rIFN-g treatment was dependent on STAT-1, a transcription factor that integrates both type I and type II IFN-receptor signaling, and functional IFN-a/b receptor. Na\u00efve WT mice adoptively transferred with encephalitogenic T-cells from type I, type II or double IFN-receptor deficient animals revealed that both type I and type II IFNs were required for the persistence of TH1 disease but not TH17 disease.

We showed previously that fluoxetine ameliorated paralysis significantly in EAE. Exploring the mechanism of this effect, we find that in vitro fluoxetine decreases cytokine production by spleen cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, with a major effect on T cells. In pure cultures, in vitro fluoxetine decreased T cell proliferation and increased Fas-dependent activation-induced cell death of T cells. T cells do not express SERT, the well-known site of action of fluoxetine. However, proliferation of T cells is primarily dependent upon the subtype of 5HT receptor, 5HTR1B, which is also known to bind fluoxetine. We therefore, hypothesized that fluoxetine may function by blocking 5HTR1B signaling. However, adding exogenous serotonin to flow cytometrically purified CD4 and CD8 T cells did not rescue this effect of fluoxetine at a high dose.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory neurodegenerative disease, thought to be of autoimmune origin. Elevated levels of antibodies are present in the cerebrospinal fluid and brain of patients with MS. However, the target antigen of these antibodies has not yet been fully characterised. Post-translational modification of myelin basic protein (MBP) and other CNS-specific proteins, including citrullination of arginine residues, results in conformational changes in the protein. This leads to increased degradation by proteases and exposure of new epitopes, which may then cause production of autoantibodies targeting the myelin sheath. Citrullination is carried out by a family of enzymes called peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs), with PAD2 and PAD4 reported to be present in the brain. Excess citrullination occurs in MS, with MBP from MS white matter being more highly citrullinated than in control white matter. In this context we investigated PAD2 and PAD4 expression by primary human astrocytes and a human brain endothelial cell line, under inflammatory conditions, and their expression and colocalisation with citrullinated proteins in MS and control tissue. This will provide a better understanding of the process of citrullination in CNS inflammation and its possible role in MS pathogenesis.",

Here we analyzed whether uptake of apoptotic autologous blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) affect the maturation and activation of human monocyte-derived DC and describe their immunostimulatory capacity and compared different methods to induce apoptosis. DC were generated from untouched CD14 positive cells in the presence of IL-4 and GM-CSF. On day 6, cells were stimulated with either ECDI-treated, UV-, gamma-irradiated or without autologous PBMC.

Cell activation and differentiation was analyzed by the expression of cell surface markers (e.g. CCR7, CD1a, CD83, CD86, HLA-DR and PDL-1), and the concentrations of various pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (e.g. TGF-beta1) in the corresponding cell culture supernatants.

Vaccines targeting A\u03b2 represent promising therapeutic options, and active immunization against A\u03b2 provided encouraging results in experimental mouse models and, to a lesser extent, in a subsequent clinical trial (AN1792). However, the AN1792 trial had to be interrupted due to the occurrence of meningoencephalitis in 6% of the treated patients. While these severe side effects were attributed to pro-inflammatory T cell responses, preclinical murine models did not show evidence of T cellrelated side effects. In addition, several reports suggest that A\u03b2-specific CD4+ T cells may be implicated in the natural course of AD and could have a strong therapeutic potential as well. Hence, better understanding adaptive T cell responses to A\u03b2 is crucial for the development of innovative vaccine strategies in AD.

Our data indicate that CD4+ T cell responsiveness to A\u03b2 is highly heterogeneous between mouse strains of different H-2 haplotypes, with SJL (H-2 s) mice displaying a strong response to A\u03b210-24 and C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice showing only a weak responsiveness to A\u03b216-30, as previously reported. Surprisingly, C57BL/6 mice congenic for the H-2 s haplotype (B6.H-2 S), which display a \"permissive\" MHC-II allele for the presentation of the immunodominant A\u03b210-24 epitope, show a very weak CD4+ T cell response to A\u03b2 similar to C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that MHCindependent factors down-modulate A\u03b2-specific CD4+ T cell responses in C57BL/6 background. Transient depletion of regulatory T cells (Treg) indicated that CD4+ T cell responses to A\u03b2 are significantly enhanced in both C57BL/6 and B6.H-2S mice upon Treg depletion, while Treg-depleted SJL mice display unaltered A\u03b2-specific T cell responses. Altogether these results suggest that the magnitude/strength of CD4+ T cell responses to A\u03b2 is controlled by both MHC-dependent and -independent factors in mice, the latter including the overall ability to develop A\u03b2-specific Treg cell responses.",

Using autologous EBV-transformed B cells and mononuclear cells HLAmatched donors as presenting cells, we found that they do not recognize peptides from candidate antigens such as MBP, MOG, or EBV.

Age and sex matched 11 healthy subjects, 22 MS patients (RR type) and 6 non-inflammatory neurological diseases (NIND) patients were enrolled in this study. Simultaneous staining of 4 chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR4, CCR5, and CCR6) on memory CD4+ T cells of PB and CSF were performed and frequency of each T cell subset (CCR4+CCR6+, CCR2+CCR5\u2212, etc.) were measured by flow cytometry. In the PB, no particular memory T cell subset was increased from MS as compared with HS or NIND irrespective of the disease state. Next, we compared the frequency of each T cell subset between CSF and PB from each relapsing MS patient and from each NIND patient. Interestingly, in both groups of patients, the frequencies of CCR2+CCR5\u2212 and CCR4+ CCR6+ cells were lower in CSF than in PB. Notably, only in MS but not in NIND patients, the frequency of CCR2+CCR5+ cells was higher in CSF than in PB, suggesting that it is preferentially recruited to the inflamed CNS.

Specifically D2 and D3 receptors were up-regulated and D5 receptor was down-modulated after CD8+ T-cell activation, whereas expression of D2 receptor was up-regulated upon activation of CD4+ T-cells. As a functional analysis of T-cell response we evaluated the effect of DA in T-cell activation as secretion of IL-2 after anti-CD3 + anti-CD28 stimulation. Our results show that DA inhibits CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell activation in a dosedependent way.

One important event of this infiltration is the transmigration of these cells through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which is mainly constituted of endothelial cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Th cells transmigration is largely attributable to integrins of the beta1 family expressed on the surface of these cells. Integrins alpha4beta1 (VLA-4) is known to be the most important beta1 integrin for this process but its blockade do not completely abrogate MS and EAE symptoms. Data from our lab suggest that effector T cells express the integrin alpha8beta1, an integrin which has never been described in T cell before. The goal of this study is to characterize the expression of integrin alpha8beta1 on CD4 Thelper cells and whether this integrin is involved in the transmigration of lymphocytes through the BBB during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and MS.",

In both MS and HC, IL-7 stimulation of Tcells lead to an increased expression of genes involved in cytotoxicity (granzyme B and perforin-1, all significant). Specifically in MS patients, an upregulation of granzyme A expression was observed (p = 0.001). Discussion: The IL-7Ra/IL-7 axis is more active in MS patients, possibly related for the maintenance of the memory T-cell pool. Recently, it was shown that MS lesions produce IL-7. The lower threshold for IL-7 induced cytotoxicity in MS patients may further enhance pathogenicity of CD8+ T-cells. This appears of special interest in light of the demyelinating and cytotoxic effects by granzyme A. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is associated with aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-specific IgG1 antibodies. Human IgG1 is a T cell-dependent antibody subclass, suggesting that AQP4-specific T cells may participate in NMO pathogenesis, a possibility supported by observations that AQP4-specific antibodies alone are not pathogenic in the absence of CNS inflammation. In order to understand the potential role of T cells in NMO pathogenesis and to develop a model of NMO, we have been studying T cell recognition of AQP4 in NMO patients and in mice.

MHC IIrestricted CD4^+ T cell lines specific for these individual AQP4 determinants proliferate in response to intact AQP4.

AQP4-specific T cells secreted both IFN-g and IL-17. Using truncated AQP4 peptides within 21-40, these T cell determinants were characterized further.

Interestingly, T cells did not penetrate into the CNS parenchyma after extravasations, but continued to scan abluminal surface of vessels.

We marked perivascular/meningeal macrophages, potential antigen presenting cells (APCs), by intrathecal injection of fluorochrome-dextran conjugates. Alternatively, APCs were marked by bone marrow transplantation that bone marrow cells derived from GFP transgenic rats were grafted into irradiated recipients. We observed both short-and long-lasting contacts between T cells and APCs, that seemed to represent antigen recognition. Gene profiling analysis supported this observation because TMBP-GFP cells were activated in the meninges compared those in the spleen or blood. Interestingly, meningeal APCs are not saturated with endogenous antigens because exogenous MBP hyper-activated TMBP-GFP cells in the CNS and exaggerated EAE. Furthermore, we showed importance of antigen presentation at CNS meninges using OVA specific T cells. Small numbers of TOVA-GFP cell appeared in the CNS meninges but they did not penetrate into the CNS parenchyma. Intrathecal injection of OVA-pulsed meningeal APCs changed situation dramatically.

However, the separate effect of T cell subsets in terms of GrB expression and subsequent neurotoxicity has not been explored. This study aims to characterize the level of GrB expression and assess the cytotoxic effect of T cell subsets on human neurons, with special emphasis on Tregs.",

            "text": "The current paradigm considers Tregs beneficial for autoimmune responses and potent suppressive of immune-mediated tissue damage. On the contrary, our findings show that CD4+CD25+ Foxp3+ T cells are neurotoxic after activation. Loss of suppressive function and IFN-gamma expression indicate a shift towards a TH-1 phenotype. GrB induces target cell apoptosis, thus, the neuronal death might be mediated by the presence of high levels of GrB expressed by CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells. These data provide important insights about the limitations of Treg cells in therapeutic applications and the requirement of serious caution in the use of Tregs for disease intervention strategies. While Tcells and macrophages play a crucial role in the primary immune attack, inflammation has also been associated with remyelination in acute MS plaques and in animal models. Since inflammation occurs concurrent with remyelination it is, however, difficult to isolate the beneficial effects of inflammation on remyelination. We have previously shown that adoptively transferred T-cells infiltrate zones of axonal lesion but devoid of autoimmune demyelination. Here, we investigate to which extent infiltrating T cells or factors released from these cells or from activated microglia/macrophages affect oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) proliferation and oligodendrocyte formation. Methods: Groups of mice were subjected to adoptive transfer of 1) proteolipid protein-specific T-cells (TPLP) and axonal lesion, 2) TPLP, 3) ovalbumin-specific T-cells (TOVA) and axonal lesion, 4) TOVA or 4) axonal lesion alone. Mice were injected with the proliferation marker BrdU and the tissues processed for cell counting of CD3+ T cells, NG2+ OPC and CNPase + oligodendrocytes along with double stainings for BrdU. The sprouting of calretinergic axons was examined through areal estimations, and the expression of cytokines was evaluated by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization techniques. Results: We found that TPLP mice with axonal lesion showed a significant increase in the proliferation of NG2+ OPC 2 days post lesion and in the formation of new CNPase + oligodendrocytes 7 days post lesion compared to lesioned TOVA or na\u00efve mice. The presence of TPLP cells also enhanced the clearance of myelin debris, increased the sprouting response of intact calretinergic fibres within the dentate gyrus, and markedly raised expression of the key inflammatory cytokines IFN and TNFa along with its p75 receptor. Conclusion: These data show that the presence of myelin-reactive T cells may have a stimulatory effect on OPC proliferation and differentiation by affecting several parameters that alone or in combination can facilitate or induce myelination. These results suggest, that in spite of the pathological role of myelin-reactive Tcell in MS the cells may also be associated with beneficial effects on regenerative processes in the brain. Mucin P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) expressed by all leukocytes is the main ligand for endothelial selectins, and is involved in leukocyte trafficking under physiological and pathological conditions. Whereas PSGL-1 role is emerging in T cell homeostasis, controversial results were obtained in animal models of autoimmune diseases. Our goal was to clarify the role of the mucin PSGL-1 in T cell responses during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE induced by active immunization was more severe in PSGL-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, whereas Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG)35-55specific T cells obtained from PSGL-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice transferred a more severe disease than WT cells, suggesting a role for PSGL-1 in regulatory mechanisms during EAE. As CD4+ T cells isolated form WT and PSGL-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice displayed similar proliferative response and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, we studied the role of PSGL-1 in the suppressor activity exerted by CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells in EAE, by using two-photon laser microscopy (TPLM). To this aim we visualized the behavior of encephalitogenic CD4+ T cells in the presence or absence of Tregs in intact draining lymph nodes during early (day 1 post-immunization) and late (day 7 post-immunization) preclinical phase of EAE. TPLM experiments showed that MOG35-55-primed T cells moved slower, had a lower motility coefficient and an enhanced arrest coefficient, displaying a less random movement, when compared to na\u00efve T cells. MOG35-55 but not ovalbumin-primed T cells showed a significant increase in their speed and a decrease of the arrest coefficient in the presence of WT Tregs in draining lymph nodes of immunized mice. Interestingly, PSGL-1 \u2212/\u2212 Tregs failed to modulate the motility behavior and proliferation of MOG35-55 CD4+ T cells during late but not early preclinical phase of EAE. In addition, na\u00efve Tregs from PSGL-1 \u2212/\u2212 mice presented reduced migration capacity to CNS in the pre-clinical phase of EAE, when compared to WT Tregs, and display a dramatic decrease of adhesive interactions in inflamed brain microcirculation. Finally, PSGL-1 deficient Tregs had a reduced capacity to suppress EAE when compared to WT cells.",

In contrast, the CD4 T cells producing only IL-17 were primarily low for Tbet expression, in keeping with the nonessential role for Tbet during Th17 differentiation. We next examined the requirement of the Th1 promoting cytokines IFNgamma and IL-12 for the induction of Tbet+CD4 T cells during EAE.

Vav1 was found within Eae4, a rat quantitative trait locus (QTL) that regulates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis (MS), and overlaps with several QTLs for immunemediated diseases. Analysis of an extensive human cohort also demonstrated association of certain haplotypes within the first intron of the gene with MS, and increased levels of VAV1 mRNA were found in peripheral blood and cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients as compared to matched controls (published results*). In an attempt to further characterize the function of VAV1 in the context of development of autoimmunity we used interval-specific congenic rat lines carrying the disease predisposing or protective Vav1 variants. We show that when immunized with recombinant rat myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant, the disease predisposing variant promotes the development of a high proinflammatory state, with higher numbers of IFN\u03b3 + \u03b3\u03b4T cells and higher numbers of both CD4 + CD8+ (double positive) T cells and CD4+ CD8dim T cells that show increased expression of the activation markers CD28, CD44, CD49d and increased Brdu incorporation, indicative of cells in cycle. Upon antigen-specific in vitro restimulation, cells from the disease predisposing variant exhibit a phenotype with increased production of IFN\u03b3 and TNF, while cells from the strain with the protective variant show increased levels of IL10, IL4 and MCP1, as well as higher overall levels of CD3+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T cells, especially within the CD8+ subset. We conclude that VAV1 plays a central role in controlling the inflammatory immune response in a rat model of EAE. Our studies are now aimed at pinpointing which stage of the immune response is specifically controlled by this nucleotide exchange factor. EAE can also be prevented by oral tolerance to MBP. However, although oral tolerance to myelin antigens has been achieved in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, there was no beneficial effect to the patients. It has recently been found that oral tolerance to egg ovalbumin also occurred in the liver, mediated specifically by plasmacytoid dendritic cells. This systemic tolerance involved delayed type hypersensitivity responses. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells have not been demonstrated in EAE lesions. Plasma cells, identified using the specific marker CD 138, are confined to the perivascular spaces in MS patients and are not present in the brain parenchyma. Cells in the parenchyma with extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and previously described as plasma cells are probably plasmacytoid dendritic cells, but this needs confirmation using the specific marked CD123.",

Astrocytes, the most abundant cells in the brain, play a crucial role in HAD progression and outcome. Recently, a rapid subtraction hybridization approach (RaSH) to determine differentially expressed genes in HIV-1 infected astrocytes, identified a novel gene, astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1), as a HIV-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a inducible transcript. Subsequently, AEG-1 was also shown to be elevated in subsets of malignant gliomas, hepatocellular and breast carcinomas, and was identified as an oncogene responsible for metastasis, anchorageindependent growth and resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Although AEG-1 was primarily identified as a HIV-1 inducible gene in astrocytes, its role in HIV-1 infection has not been studied so far. Astrocytes as crucial regulators of brain homeostasis, have been the focus of HAD research for a long time. Therefore, it would be very beneficial to study the role of AEG-1 in the astrocyte responses orchestrated during HIV-1 infection of the brain. Here, we propose that AEG-1 can be a crucial contributing factor to HAD progression as it can modulate the astrocyte responses to inflammation, injury and stress generated during the pathogenesis of HAD by activating the downstream nuclear factor (NF)-kB pathway.",

Introduction: Inflammatory mechanisms play a key role in the pathophysiology of postischemic inflammation following stroke. Resident microglial cells and invading immune cells are major contributors to the postischemic inflammation. The different immune cell subpopulations are integrated in a complex cytokine network, which is composed of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines. The goal of our study is the elucidation of immunological mechanisms underlying the activation of the immune system in the ischemic brain. Methods: Intracellular cytokine production was analyzed by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis in immune cell subpopulations following temporary occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) and subsequent purification of immune cells out of the brain homogenate. Results: At day 1, the cytokine production in T cells is dominated by Interferon gamma (INFg) and TNF alpha in CD4 and CD8 positive T cells. On day 3, gamma delta T cells (gd T cells) emerge in the ischemic hemisphere, which are the major producers of IL17A, followed by CD4 positive T cells and NKT cells producing smaller amounts of IL17A. Regarding antigen-presenting cells (APCs), macrophages and microglial cells are the major producers of TNF alpha, whereas neutrophils contribute substantial amounts of IL6. Next, we utilized lymphocyte deficient Rag1 mice to analyze the interplay between T cells and APCs. According with published data Rag mice exhibited smaller infarct volumes 3 days post stroke. Additionally, the deficiency in lymphocytes resulted in substantial decrease in TNF production in macrophages whereas the microglia-derived TNF production was unaffected. Conclusion: Initially, the cytokine milieu in the ischemic hemisphere is dominated by INFg and TNF alpha produced by CD4 and CD8 T cells. Then atypical T cells producing IL17A invade the ischemic hemisphere. In parallel macrophages and microglial cells produce large amounts of TNF. Remarkably, T cells seem to play a central role already in the orchestration of the initial immune response, since the activation of pro-inflammatory macrophages is decreased in Rag mice. The further characterization of the immunological mechanisms of the postischemic inflammation will provide valuable insights into the role of different immune cell population and their activation and modulation by cytokine pathways.",

Targeted inactivation of FADD in mice results in early embryonic lethality with signs of cardiac failure and hemorrhage.

The alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) is a wellknown mediator of inflammation. Activated alpha7 nAChRs expressed on macrophages suppress the synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNFalpha. It remains possible that the immune system itself reciprocally regulates the functions of the alpha7 nAChR on microglia, astrocytes and neurons in the brain. Furthermore, inflammation in the brain is associated with multiple disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). Hence, understanding the functional consequences of a potential bi-directional cross-talk between the immune system and the alpha7 nAChR is important. Our laboratory is interested in the relationship between the alpha7 nAChR and ASDs because genome-wide association studies link the alpha7 nAChR to ASDs; post-mortem analyses of specific regions of ASD patient brains show an increase in alpha7 nAChR levels; and we identified a functional association between nAChRs and neurexins, presynaptic cell adhesion molecules. Bi-directional interactions between neurexins and their postsynaptic binding partners, the neuroligins, promote synapse maturation by recruiting specific pre-and post-synaptic molecules, including nicotinic receptors to synapses.

Why these lesions fail to remyelinate is unclear, as endogenous repair mechanisms normally act to ensure rapid and essentially complete remyelination in the CNS. Several reports suggest that failure of remyelination in MS may be due over-or under-expression of factors influencing oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) migration and/or differentiation.

To investigate the functional significance of this observation we treated myelinating CNS cultures with exogenous FGF9. In this experimental setting, FGF9 inhibited the ability of mature oligodendrocytes to myelinate axons in a dose dependent manner; an effect associated with a corresponding decrease in transcripts encoding myelin proteins and myelin related transcription factors. However, a genomewide microarray analysis revealed that in addition to this negative effect on myelination, FGF9 also significantly enhanced expression of genes implicated in neuroprotection and neuronal survival. These account for 15% of the hundred genes most highly up-regulated by FGF9. We hypothesize that FGF9 mediated neuroprotective effects contribute to the survival of axons that traverse persistently demyelinated gliotic plaques in MS, albeit at the expense of impairing remyelination. Understanding the molecular basis of these diverse effects may lead to improved neuroprotective therapies for MS. Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a leading form of viral encephalitis in the world and is caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) which belongs to the family flaviviridae. Evasion of peripheral immune system facilitates the entry of the virus into the central nervous system (CNS) where is causes neuronal death that results from the inflammatory milieu generated in the CNS due to microglial activation. Peripheral macrophages constitute an important part of the immune surveillance. It has been proposed that after entry into the body, the virus may be carried into the CNS by peripheral immune cells such as the macrophages, which acts as 'Trojan horses'. JEV has been shown to persist within macrophages long enough to be carried into the CNS. We have shown earlier that the blood-brain barrier is critically compromised in JE which results in massive infiltration of peripheral cells in the CNS. However, it is unclear whether these accumulating virus-infected peripheral macrophages in CNS, can also contribute to death of potentially viable neurons.",

CD20 B cell depletion prevented or reversed established MOG protein-induced EAE, which was associated with less CNS inflammation, elimination of meningeal B cells, and reduction of MOG-specific Th1 and Th17 cells. In contrast, B cells from mice immunized with MOG p35-55 did not become activated, and similar to naive B cells, they could present MOG peptide, but not MOG protein, to MOG p35-55-specific T cells. Further, although MOG p35-55 binds MHC II directly on unactivated or naive B cells, when used as APC, these B cells did not efficiently promote Th1 or Th17 differentiation. In EAE induced by MOG p35-55, anti-CD20 treatment exacerbated EAE, and did not alter development of Th1 or Th17 cells. Irrespective of the EAE model used, B cell depletion reduced the frequency of CD25 + FoxP3 + regulatory T cells (Treg). After CD20 depletion, remaining myeloid (CD11b + ) APC produced more TNF and less IL-10, and when serving as APC promoted development of encephalitogenic T cells.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) is the standard treatment; however, its effect is short-lived and does not halt long term progression. Trials of other immunomodulatory agents have shown no benefit to date. MMN is known to be an antibody-mediated disease; up to 80% of patients are positive for anti-GM1 glycolipid antibody. Animal models of anti-GM1 antibody-mediated neuropathy require complement activation for neural destruction. Complete inhibition of nerve damage is displayed when terminal complement activation is inhibited by Eculizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody which specifically prevents cleavage of C5 and thus terminal complement activation. Eculizumab is licensed to treat paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH).

The multiple nature of neuroinflammation is being increasingly recognized, where inflammatory cells and molecules on the one hand can damage neural elements, but where beneficial aspects of neuroinflammation that can promote repair also occur. The challenge of harnessing beneficial aspects of neuroinflammation is to avoid its potential detrimental consequences.

To facilitate the transition to a mouse model in vivo, we tested and found that AmpB similarly increased the activity of macrophages cultured from the bone marrow of mice; activity was determined by expression of toll-like receptors (TLRs), scavenger receptors and cytokines. Moreover, the increase in activity of cultured mouse macrophages by AmpB was enhanced by simultaneous treatment with another agent known to have effects on monocytoid cells: macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). We next produced demyelination of the mouse spinal cord by the local injection of the lipid-disrupting agent lysolecithin into the dorsal column of the T3/T4 region. Three days after, significant demyelination in the spinal cord was accompanied by elevation of several markers of monocytoid activity. Importantly, the systemic injections of the combination of AmpB and MCSF further elevated these monocytoid markers.

Subsequently, activated immune cells produce proinflammatory cytokines which induce the local expression of IFNGR2 as well as major downstream effectors of IFN-g signalling pathways by the attacked myofibers. Thus, the attacked fibers are stimulated to release factors attracting more inflammatory cells, which further amplify the focal inflammatory changes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory response against constituents of the central nervous system.

In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-12, IFN-and IL-27) but not anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4 and IL-10) induced increased HLA-E expression on the cell surface of CD4 T cells.

Conditioning for DRB1*1501 revealed that this association merely reflected the well described effect of DRB1*1501 on MS susceptibility. Still, MS patients carrying the GC haplotype showed a significantly lower (p b 0.05) potential to upregulate HLA-E surface expression on T and B cells after activation.

In one patient, a monoclonal gd-T cell expansion was observed. Therefore the gd-TCR chains could be cloned easily and were then expressed in a T-hybridoma cell line that lacks endogenous TCR chains. In previous experiments, we found that the gd-TCR recognizes an enigmatic antigen that is expressed not only in human muscle fibers but also in other tissues and species. Therefore we surmised that the gd-TCR might recognize not a defined epitope, but rather an evolutionary conserved motif. We here describe the molecular characterisation of the antigenic motif of this pathogenic gd-TCR.",

Effector/memory CD4+ T cells specific for myelin antigens perpetuate central nervous system (CNS) inflammation in multiple sclerosis (MS). After becoming activated in the periphery, these CD4+ T cells cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the unique microenvironment of the CNSan environment designed to limit deleterious inflammation to a primarily non-regenerative organ. Once in the CNS, CD4+ T cells are re-activated and create an inflammatory microenvironment that causes damage to the myelin sheath of axons, leading to clinical neurological impairment.

            "text": "Calcium signalling plays a crucial role in T cell activation and proliferation. The calcium response involves the influx of calcium through Orai1/CRACM1 channels located within the plasma membrane. Opening these channels requires continuous Ca2+ release from intracellular pools and is mediated by three different Ca2+ mobilizing second messengers, namely D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP). Due to a lack of biocompatible and specific inhibitors, the functional impact of each distinct Ca2+-mobilizing second messenger is poorly understood. Using a recently developed inhibitor that selectively interferes with NAADP-mediated Ca2+ release, we explored the role of NAADP in autoreactive effector T cells during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and neuritis (EAN), animal models for multiple sclerosis and Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome, respectively. Molecular analyses revealed that NAADP signaling influences T cell re-activation upon arrival in the nervous tissues: NAADP inhibitor treatment significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN and IL-17. Live two photon imaging showed that changes in T cell motility go together with these functional changes. In the EAE lesions effector T cells display characteristic locomotion patterns: 35% of the infiltrated T cells are stationary in the phase of antigen recognition whereas the remaining cells (65%) are motile and move with high speed through the CNS tissue. After NAADP inhibitor treatment a higher fraction (N80%) of T cells was motile and their invasive capacity was reduced. Accordingly, clinical symptoms of EAE and EAN were ameliorated. In vitro, antigen-triggered T cell proliferation and cytokine production were evenly suppressed. Remarkably, na\u00efve and long-lived memory T cells were targeted significantly less by the NAADP inhibitor. The differential susceptibility correlated with the expression of RyR1, the putative receptor for NAADP-triggered Ca2+ signaling in T cells, which was up-regulated in effector T cells compared to that in na\u00efve and memory T cells.",

Recent studies indicate that components of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway play an important role in vascular proliferation, differentiation and tissue repair in adult tissues.

Chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and prion disease may evolve over many years prior to the presentation of clinical symptoms. In association with the accumulation of misfolded protein and the slow degeneration of neurons and their processes microglia, the resident macrophages of the CNS, take on an activated morphology and increase in number. How these cells of the innate immune system contribute to disease progression is at present unclear. In a murine model of prion disease we have demonstrated that in the presence of misfolded protein and slow degeneration of neurons the microglia are associated with an atypical anti-inflammatory profile dominated by TGF\u03b2, PGE2 and CCL2. The microglia are a very long-lived population of tissue macrophages and thus retain an 'innate immune memory' of the ongoing tissue degeneration. This phenotype is switched to a robust pro-inflammatory phenotype by systemic inflammation, which in turn leads to exaggerated symptoms of sickness behaviours, increased neuronal degeneration and accelerated disease progression (Cunningham et al., 2005; 2009 ). Systemic inflammation has been shown to exacerbate neuronal degeneration in a number of other models of chronic neurodegeneration. Since systemic inflammation can switch the microglia phenotype in pre-clinical models we investigated whether systemic inflammation affects disease progression in patients with Alzheimer's disease. We find that patients with raised serum levels of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), indicative of chronic systemic inflammation, and those who contract an acute systemic infection show a greater rate of cognitive decline than patients with low levels of TNF and no systemic infections (Holmes et al., 2009) . We propose that systemic inflammation and infection contribute to the rate of progression of chronic neurodegenerative disease by switching microglia to a pro-inflammatory and tissue damaging phenotype. Microglial-mediated neuroinflammatory processes are involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, recent reports have suggested a crucial role of invading blood-derived monocytic cells (BDMC) in the pathogenesis of cerebral amyloidosis in transgenic mice. We have established a novel protocol that allows for the conditional ablation of microglia by administrating ganciclovir (GCV) to transgenic CD11b-HSVTK (TK) mice. By crossing TK mice to various APP transgenic mice we have found that microglial ablation for up to four weeks has no effect on the formation or the maintenance of the amyloid pathology (Grathwohl et al., Nat Neurosci 2009) . More recently, we have again utilized the TK mice and established an irradiation-independent assay to repopulate the entire mouse brain with BDMC following microglia cell depletion. We have now taken advantage of these mouse models to determine the consequences of microglial ablation and BDMC invasion on normal brain function as well as the pathogenesis of the amyloid lesions in transgenic mouse models.",

In addition, age is the main risk factor for sporadic forms of neurodegenerative diseases, and aging of peripheral organs may affect brain function. How the systemic environment affects brain health is largely unknown and while some of these interactions may involve cells entering the nervous tissue it is likely that many are mediated by soluble factors. We use antibody-based microarrays or Luminex technology to measure the relative levels of up to 700 secreted signaling proteins including cytokines and growth factors in plasma from humans and mice and correlate them with molecular and cellular changes in the brain. Using these methods we identified for example, proteins which are strongly neuroprotective when administered into mice systemically or age-related factors which regulate neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. Our findings point to systemic changes of immune responses and cellular signaling factors with aging and in neurodegeneration and may have relevance for our understanding and diagnosis of age-related neurodegeneration. They also support the use of our focused proteomic approach to study cellular signaling proteins which we collectively call the \"communicome\" as a means to understand pathophysiological and physiological changes in the brain. In my talk I want to summarize our recent insights into the pathogenesis of immune-mediated axon damage in vivo. Immunemediated axon damage plays a crucial role in inflammatory diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) like multiple sclerosis (MS). In MS, immune cells infiltrate brain and spinal cord and attack axons and their surrounding myelin sheets. We know by now that the number of axons damaged by immune cells critically determines the clinical disability of MS patients; however, we still understand very little about the process that leads to axon damage.",

We could further identify intermediate stages of \"focal axonal degeneration\" that can persist for several days and progress either to the degeneration or full recovery of the affected axons. Interestingly, demyelination does not appear to be a prerequisite for the induction of axon damage. In contrast, mitochondrial damage appears to be the earliest ultrastructural sign of axon damage. Further, early stages of \"focal axonal degeneration\" are often associated with persistent macrophage contacts suggesting that macrophage-derived mediators play a crucial role for the induction of this process. We are currently trying to identify the molecular mediators that induce the degeneration process and reveal the intra-axonal mechanism that leads to axon fragmentation.",

EAE mouse models have revealed neuropathology in the spinal cord, brainstem and cerebellum, but the impact of EAE on the cerebral cortex remains poorly understood. Using in vivo transcranial two-photon microscopy, we examined dendritic spine plasticity and microglial activation in the somatosensory cortex in a mouse model of EAE induced by immunization with myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprogein 35-55 (MOG). We found that mice with MOG-induced EAE displayed a significant increase in dendritic spine turnover at least 4-5 days before the onset of neurological symptoms. Concomitant with dendritic spine instability, microglia displayed a reactive phenotype including changes in morphology and distribution. Dendritic spine instability and microglial activation continued at the peak stage of EAE and subsided 2 months after the EAE-inducing MOG injection. These observations indicate that MOG-induced EAE profoundly disrupts synaptic connections in the cortex. They also suggest that microglial activation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of EAE. Several proinflammatory cytokines produced by active microglia, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1, are known to regulate synaptic plasticity. We are presently studying how microglial activation and increased proinflammatory cytokine production contribute to EAE-associated synaptic pathology and recovery in the cortex. Several novel autoantibodies have been discovered in the field of Neurology that, due to their outstanding significance for diagnosis and therapy, have been rapidly translated into clinical patient care. Among the most important markers are autoantibodies directed against aquaporin-4 and against NMDA-type glutamate receptors (also called NMDA receptors). Detection of these antibodies in the serum or cerebrospinal fluid can determine the fate of affected patients. Autoantibodies against aquaporin-4 are found in patients with neuromyelitis optica (NMO, also known as Devic's syndrome) and its subforms. Early and aggressive immunosuppressive therapy is decisive for the future disease course. Detection of anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies allows differentiation of NMO from multiple sclerosis, which is particularly important as NMO and MS are treated with different drugs. In addition, antibodies against aquaporin-4 discriminate a small but significant subgroup of patients with neuropsychiatric SLE and primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome in whom therapeutic strategies such as for NMO need to be applied. Autoantibodies against NMDA receptors are characteristic of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, a currently still widely underdiagnosed autoimmune disease, which was first described in 2007 in young patients with ovarian teratoma. However, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is now also increasingly diagnosed in older female patients, in women without teratoma as well as in men and in children. The disease often starts with a flu-like preliminary stage, followed by psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety, excitement, strange behaviour, delusions and hallucinations. Therefore, a large proportion of these patients are initially admitted to psychiatric wards. Within a few weeks epileptic attacks and clouding of consciousness occur, which can eventually lead to coma. Final diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is based on the detection of antibodies against glutamate receptors of type NMDA in the serum or CSF of patients. In principle, anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis is curable, even after long, intensive medical treatment and long-term ventilation. A prerequisite, however, is rapid diagnosis with early therapy and complete removal of the tumour, if present. Further novel and highly specific autoantibodies in patients with limbic encephalitis comprise antibodies directed against the GABAB-receptors and against novel antigenic targets previously attributed to VKKC that will also be discussed.",

The model starts with the idea that the immune system defines \"danger\" as anything that causes tissue stress or destruction.

I no longer believe this. Although pathogens certainly have an influence on the immune responses made against them (usually finding ways to modify those responses to their liking), I believe that there is a more fundamental underlying system of control. I believe that the ultimate controllers of immunity are the tissues that the immune system was designed to protect. When injured, tissues emit alarm signals that initiate immune responses. When not injured, tissues present their own antigens, or release them to passing DCs to present to T cells in order to induce tolerance. Moreover, when an immune response does occur, the tissues send signals that direct the immune system to tailor that response to an effector class that can eliminate the pathogen without causing more damage to the tissue.",

In the adult CNS, the type and magnitude of microglial activation and macrophage influx triggered by systemic inflammation are well characterized. As yet, little is known about if and how microglial phenotype changes during critical periods of CNS development associated with synaptogenesis and oligodendrocyte development. Here, using flow cytometry and dual in situ hybridization/ immunohistochemistry we show that in the early postnatal murine brain, microglia display an activated phenotype that is not polarized toward either \"classic\" proinflammatory or \"alternative\" anti-inflammatory activation states. Furthermore, we find that at all ages examined, systemic inflammation induced by an intraperitoneal injection of LPS leads to widespread activation of microglia and a transient influx of peripheral macrophages into the murine CNS. However, the magnitude of macrophage influx into the CNS is developmentally modulated. In addition, CNS-infiltrating macrophages display a polarized pro-inflammatory phenotype. During this same developmental period, microglial activation is associated with high level expression of multiple alternative activation markers and induction of TREM2. We speculate that these microglial-specific forms of activation in part serve to compensate for the higher levels of proinflammatory macrophages that infiltrate the CNS during early development. Altogether our data contribute to the growing literature demonstrating that the brain may have age-specific susceptibilities to insults associated with the development and treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders.",

This concept is based on descriptive studies of human CSF and analytical studies of the subarachnoid space in murine EAE. Normal human CSF contains between 1.5 and 3 \u00d7 105 cells, the majority being CD4+/CD45RO+/ CD27+/CCR7+/CXCR3+/L-selectinhi central memory T cells, about half of which are CD69-positive. These cells routinely traverse the choroid plexus stromal vessels and epithelium, and enter and exit the CSF approximately twice per day, providing a continuous supply of lymphocytes with novel antigenic specificities. CSF T cells are enormously enriched for these activated CD4+ central memory T cells, as compared with circulating blood, where they constitute at most b5% of leukocytes. Lumbar and ventricular CSF of patients without CNS inflammation contain a similar cellular component, supporting the proposal that many CSF cells enter across the choroid plexus. All committed tissue specific memory T cells are represented in the CSF with an equal proportion as found in blood. In healthy mice, CD4+ T cells in the subarachnoid space perform serial 'scanning' encounters with MHC class II+ APCs. During EAE, antigen recognition and clonal expansion occur in the subarachnoid space, days before such events in the spinal cord parenchyma. We integrate these observations with experimental studies showing how subarachnoid space inflammation is coupled to parenchymal vascular activation, as well as invasion of the parenchyma by hematogenous cells. Finally, the novel finding of subpial demyelination early in the course of MS, suggests that the MS disease process may in part proceed 'from the outside in' with cortical demyelination and meningeal inflammation setting the stage for white matter lesions, and for the persistence of the disease process.",

It is known that autoreactive CD4+ T cells of the Th1 and Th17 subtypes are involved in MS pathogenesis. Currently licensed therapies for MS include forms of interferon beta as well as more specifically targeted agents directed at adhesion molecules and the antigen receptor complex. In the search for additional therapies, we have focused on hormonal, cytokine and genetic approaches to treatment of MS using the model system experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The hormonal studies have their foundations in the observation that women with MS exhibit markedly fewer relapses during pregnancy, but show relapses of disease postpartum. Our studies have shown that EAE clinical signs are markedly reduced when pregnancy is induced during ongoing EAE, which is accompanied by a decrease in CNS histopathologic changes and suppression of inflammatory cytokine production. We have identified serum exosomes as the mediator of disease suppression and analyzed the contents of exosomes by differential gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The results of those analyses suggest that exosomal proteins act to decrease inflammation as well as enhance neural regeneration.",

Further, a small molecule inhibitor of MIF, designed by Cytokine Pharmasciences, has also been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of EAE, even when treatment is begun after the appearance of EAE clinical signs. We have shown that treatment of microglial cultures with MIF upregulates IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, iNOS and CCL2 levels. Moreover, microinjection of rMIF in vivo into the spinal cord has shown transient microglial reactivity and cellular accumulation within the CNS. Thus inhibition of MIF could well serve as an important therapeutic approach for CNS inflammation.",

Using a targeted proteomic screen we identified a conserved subset of blood borne chemokinesincluding CCL2/MCP-1 and CCL11/Eotaxinwhose plasma levels correlate with reduced neurogenesis observed in normal aging and heterochronic parabiosis. Functionally, we demonstrate that mimicking an aged systemic environment by increasing the level of CCL11 in the periphery of young adult mice results in decreased neurogenesis in vivo. Additionally, we show that CCL2 and CCL11 decrease progenitor frequency and neuronal differentiation in vitro. Using a pharmacological approach we also demonstrate that the inhibitory effects of systemically administered CCL11 can be mitigated by neutralization either systemically or directly within the central nervous system.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are promising vehicles for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). This is in part due to their broad immunomodulatory properties and ability to home to sites of tissue inflammation and injury. We have previously investigated the therapeutic potential of human MSCs in ameliorating the MS-like disease in mice, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). A comparison of MSCs from three different tissue sources revealed that the therapeutic efficacy of adipose-derived MSCs (Ad-MSCs) was greater than that of the other MSCs tested, in terms of suppression of clinical and pathological signs of disease. The anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) has been extensively studied in the EAE model and has been found to play an important immunoregulatory role. However, treatment of EAE with systemic administration of IL-10 has yielded contradictory results, suggesting that the timing and mode of delivery may be crucial to the effectiveness of IL-10 treatment. In the present study, we aimed to explore the use of Ad-MSCs as vehicles for delivery of IL-10 to mice with EAE.",

Importantly, the cell surface phenotype, differentiation potential and expression of chemokine receptors by Ad-MSCs were unaffected by the transduction process. In vivo transplantation studies showed that systemic administration of IL-10 expressing Ad-MSCs, either by intravenous or intraperitoneal injection, during the initiation phase of disease could prevent or significantly delay the development of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE. In protected mice, T-cell proliferative responses to MOG were found to be dramatically reduced in comparison to controls and unprotected mice.

B-cell activating factor (BAFF) plays an essential role in B-cell homeostasis. When over-expressed, BAFF protects B-cells from apoptosis, thereby contributing to autoimmunity. Patients with MG have higher levels of BAFF in the circulation compared to healthy subjects. BAFF-R and TACI (transmembrane activator and cyclophilin ligand interactor) are two cell-surface receptors that bind BAFF ligand. In na\u00efve B-cells, the BAFF-R is the main receptor that mediates BAFF signals. When activated, B-cells downregulate BAFF-R and upregulate TACI expression. We postulated that the ratio of BAFF-R to TACI might be altered in patients with MG. Our aim was to determine the frequency of B-cells that express BAFF-R and TACI, and to determine the intensity of expression of each receptor on the B-cell surface.",

We also observed distinct loci that regulate IgG levels at the onset of disease compared to late stages. For example IgG2b production at the onset is regulated by a locus on chromosome 8, whereas a region on chromosome 10 determines its late stage response. A striking influence on almost all of IgG isotypes is conferred by a locus on chromosome 4 with PVG allele driving higher IgG levels. Using the AIL we significantly reduced the confidence interval of this locus, from 25 Mb to 2 Mb, containing only few genes including antigen presenting lectin-like type receptor complex. A congenic strain, that carries PVG alleles at this locus on the susceptible DA background, confirmed that the locus regulates EAE, B cell numbers and IgG levels. IgG2b and IgG levels were higher in congenic rats compared to DA controls. Interestingly, this correlated with less severe disease.",

This procedure is based on expression of a cDNA library fused to filamentous phage protein VI and interactions between exposed proteins and Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies. We produced two cDNA display libraries: first a normalized cDNA library derived from active chronic MS plaques, with varying degrees of demyelination and inflammatory activity (10 6 primary recombinants) was used. The second cDNA library used, is constructed from normal brain with a primary diversity of 0.9 \u00d7 10 6 recombinants. cDNA inserts from each library were cloned into our pVI phage display vector system, resulting in a library size of 1.1 \u00d7 10 7 colony forming units (cfu) and 5.3 \u00d7 10 6 cfu, respectively. The results of the SAS procedures were characterized with PCR and restriction digestion analysis. Subsequently, enriched putative antigenic targets displayed on phage were identified with sequence analysis. This led to the identification of 18 CSF candidate antigens for CIS, 11 for RRMS and 13 for PPMS. Some of the enriched clones identified were identical, although derived from separate SAS procedures with the two cDNA libraries, indicating a specific antibody response. Clones that have been identified show also homology with MS-related proteins. However, no antibody reactivity against these targets has been described so far.",

Subsequently, we have used PLP190-209specific T cells to passively induce EAE. To our surprise, these mice consistently developed lesions in the brainstem, but never developed lesions in the cerebellum. Since the mice with actively induced EAE produce both PLP190-209-specific T cells and antibodies, we have investigated the role of antibody in the development of cerebellar lesions in this model. EAE was induced by passive transfer of PLP190-209-specific T cells \u00b1 immunoaffinity-purified PLP190-209 specific antibody or an irrelevant antibody as control. Within 2 days of onset of neurological signs, mice were perfused. One micron sections were cut every 10 \u03bcm through the brainstem and cerebellum and stained with cresyl violet to assess lesions. Whole cross-sections were photographed and the percentage area of each cerebellum covered by lesions was determined using NIH Image software. To assess the role of complement, EAE was actively induced, and then mice were treated daily with injections of cobra venom factor (CVF), which inhibits complement. These mice developed EAE and were assessed as above. CVF has a short half-life in serum, and therefore, in some mice, CVF treatment was stopped at EAE onset, and 4 days later mice were assessed for lesions in the cerebellum.",

Altered plasma glutamate levels, for example, have been strongly correlated with immunodeficiency states, such as AIDS and malignancies, suggesting that glutamate is capable of acting as an immunomodulator. While glutamate receptor signaling has been examined in some immune cells (e.g. T cells), the effects of glutamatergic stimuli on B lymphocytes remain unknown. To determine if glutamate is capable of modulating B cell function, we first examined mouse B cells for glutamate receptor expression. Furthermore, mouse splenocytes were cultured in glutamateenriched media; proliferation and antibody production were determined. FACS analysis shows that splenic B2 B cells express the receptor subunits that comprise the kainate receptor (KAR), a specific subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptor. KAR surface expression was found to be upregulated upon B cell stimulation. Moreover, when splenocytes and B cells were stimulated with IL-4 and CD40 ligand in glutamate enriched media, there was a significant increase in cellular proliferation and antibody (IgG1 and IgE) production. The KAR specific antagonist NS-102 is being used to confirm that these effects are mediated by KARs. The data also suggests that ADAM10 is required for the proliferative enhancing activity of glutamate. These results suggest that glutamate is capable of enhancing B cell function. In a previous study aimed at the high-throughput profiling of the autoantibodies present within multiple sclerosis (MS) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we identified a novel MS CSF autoantibody target, sperm associated antigen 16 isoform 2 (SPAG16-2). As tissue expression, protein function and disease-contributing role of SPAG16-2 are unknown, further investigation into this candidate MS autoantigen was warranted.

TLR-mediated activation of microglia resulted in a dramatically altered ADORA expression profile, characterized by the simultaneously up-regulation of A2AR and down-regulation of A3R expression levels. As a consequence of this altered expression profile, activated microglia were highly sensitized to adenosine-mediated inhibition of subsequent TLR-induced cytokine responses. This enhanced inhibitory effect could be attributed to an increase of A2AR-mediated signaling, and we further demonstrate that this involves the suppression of NF-kappaB activation. Importantly, by using combinations of subtypespecific agonists and antagonists, we show that in unstimulated microglia, A2AR-mediated inhibitory signaling was effectively counteracted by A3Rmediated signaling. In activated microglia, the decrease in A3R-mediated signaling shifted the balance towards A2AR-mediated signaling, sensitizing the cells to inhibitory signaling.",

These data may provide insight to why epidemiological studies consistently find a protective effect of anti-inflammatory drugs only when taken during normal aging, while such drugs in AD patients have typically failed. We previously described a blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown leading to serum-protein leakage in the hippocampus of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). A BBB disruption induces an accumulation of immunoglobulins G (IgGs) in parenchyma and surprisingly, in pyramidal neurons. We postulated that IgG leakage contributes by immune activation or by toxicity to epileptogenesis. In this study, we correlated the BBB damage with serum protein leakage in epileptic and non epileptic tissues.",

Background: Interleukin (IL)-27 is a cytokine produced by antigen presenting cells with multiple roles in the induction as well as in regulation of the immune responses. However, the effect of IL-27 on natural killer (NK) cells is not well defined. NK cells, particularly the CD56bright subset, play a significant role in the immune regulation and might be playing a protective function during Autoimmunity. Objective: To investigate the possible effects of IL-27 on human CD56bright and CD56dim NK cell phenotype and function. Methods: NK cells were isolated from buffy coats of healthy individuals using Mitenyi Beads, sorted into CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells and cultured under different conditions with or without addition of IL-27 to study the potential effects of IL-27 on proliferation, expression of surface markers, transcription factors and cytokine secretion of treated NK cells. IL-27 stimulated NK cells were co-cultured with autologous T cells to investigate the regulatory function of treated NK cells. In addition, IL-27 stimulated NK cells were studied for induction of cytotoxic function against target cell line. Results: Phenotypic characterization suggests that IL-27R is expressed by both ex-vivo isolated CD56bright and CD56dim NK cell subsets, with a markedly increased expression among CD56bright NK cells. IL-27 treatment decreased the proliferation of both CD56bright and CD56dim NK cells. This decreased proliferation of NK subsets was correlated with an increased expression of IL-10 in stimulated NK cells subsets. Moreover, IL-27 treated CD56bright NK were suppressive against autologous CD4 T cell proliferation in a contact dependent mechanism. This suppressive ability seems to be dependent upon expression of perforin among treated NK cells. In contrast, IL-27 treatment of CD56dim NK cells did not change their cytotoxic or suppressive function.",

Preliminary studies have also found that stimulation with TLR9 agonist CpG type A also results in suppression of chronic EAE. In both cases disease suppression is associated with an expansion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in the CNS as shown by expression of PDCA-1, B220 and CD11c. In TLR7 experiments we have found increased production of IFN-beta in spleens of mice treated with Imiquimod as measured by RT-PCR. We have also generated pDCs in vitro and found that Imiquimod induces the expansion of pDCs and also the production of IFN-beta. The expansion of pDCs in response to imiquimod is dependent on the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR) as mice lacking the receptor did not expand pDCs. In vivo depletion of pDCs has been found to reduce EAE severity. Interestingly, preliminary experiments have shown that Imiquimod exacerbates EAE in the absence of pDCs which indicates that the protective effect of Imiquimod is dependent on pDCs.",

Cerebral ischemia is accompanied by an acute inflammation, involving the activation of microglia and the infiltration of neutrophil granulocytes and monocytes into the brain. How these different immune cell types contribute to the neuronal outcome after cerebral ischemia is still under discussion. Various significant actions of immune cells are just to reveal by imaging them either in vitro/ex vivo or in vivo. We developed a postischemic ex vivo model of immune cell (fluorescently labeled) application on hippocampal slices with eYFP expression in neurons. We observed two significant mechanisms how microglia protect neurons after ischemia. On the one hand microglia were found ischemic induced in close proximity or in physical cell-cell contact to the neurons and on the other hand microglia eliminated infiltrating neutrophil granulocytes very fast and efficient. Blocking both properties yielded in an exacerbation of neuronal damage. To test our hypothesis in vivo we generated a mouse transgenic for neutrophils (Lys-EGFP) and microglia (CX3CR1-EGFP). For experimental cerebral ischemia we used a model of permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion combined with an occlusion of the common carotid arteries for 20 min. With intracranial two-photon microscopy (TPM) we are able to image these cells to a depth of 300 \u03bcm in vivo after ischemic lesions. To date we observed a rapid infiltration of neutrophils and a very fast response of microglia to damaged vessels after ischemia. In more detail neutrophil granulocytes adhere promptly to the vessels and subsequently invade the cerebral parenchyma. Furthermore microglia seemed to shield inflamed vessels by sending their processes. This approach is suitable to answer a wide range of questions on how immune cells respond to cerebral ischemic events and might contribute to gain intelligence for developing suitable therapeutic strategies. Cuban multiple sclerosis (MS) patients were evaluated to Intrathecal measles (M)-rubella (R)-and varicella zoster (Z)antibody synthesis and NFL-AI, since these have not been reported in our country, yet.

Moreover, comparing RNFL thickness decline with histopathological analysis of the optic nerve our results suggest an early and in part inflammation independent process of RNFL degeneration in autoimmune optic neuritis. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and remyelination in MS ultimately fails. Although strategies to promote myelin repair are eagerly sought, mechanisms underlying remyelination in vivo have been elusive. CXCR2 is expressed on neutrophils and oligodendrocyte lineage cells in the central nervous system (CNS). CXCR2 positive neutrophils facilitate inflammatory demyelination in demyelination models such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and cuprizone intoxication. Systemic injection of a small molecule CXCR2 antagonist at the onset of EAE decreased demyelinated lesions. These results left the cellular target of the CXCR2 antagonist uncertain, and did not clarify whether CXCR2 blockade prevented demyelination or promoted remyelination. Here, we show that the actions of CXCR2 on nonhematopoietic cells unexpectedly delay myelin repair. Bone marrow chimeric mice (Cxcr2+/ \u2192 Cxcr2/ and Cxcr2+/ \u2192 Cxcr2+/+) were subjected to two distinct models of myelin injury. In all cases, myelin repair was more efficient in Cxcr2+/ \u2192 Cxcr2/ animals. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in demyelinated lesions of Cxcr2+/ \u2192 Cxcr2/ mice proliferated earlier and more vigorously than in tissues from Cxcr2+/ \u2192 Cxcr2+/+ animals. In vitro demyelinated CNS slice cultures also showed better myelin repair when CXCR2 was blocked with neutralizing antibodies, or was genetically deleted. Our results suggest that CXCR2 inactivation permits optimal spatiotemporal positioning of OPCs in demyelinating lesions to receive local proliferative and differentiating signals. Given that CXCR2 exerts dual functions which promote demyelination and decrease remyelination by actions towards hematopoietic cells and non-hematopoietic cells respectively, our findings identify CXCR2 as a promising drug target for clinical demyelinating disorders. We suggest that the small moleculemildronate [3-(2,2,2trimethylhydrazinium) propionate dehydrate], a representative of aza-butyrobetaine classmay be suitable for the regulation of crosstalk between the immune and nervous system processes impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD).

The nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) is activated in neurons and glia in response to oxidative DNA damage resulting from cerebral ischemia/reperfusion. Since PARP-1 is compartmentalized to the nucleus, a critical unanswered question is, how does nuclear PARP-1 send death signals to mitochondria? Despite some intriguing recent findings, this signaling pathway remains poorly understood. Bnip3, a Bcl-2 family pro-apoptotic protein, causes neuron death in a manner sharing several common features with PARP-1-induced neuron death. Studying a link between PARP-1 and Bnip3 is attractive based on these commonalities.",

Primary mouse cortical neuron cultures from wild-type and PARP-1\u2212/\u2212 mice were exposed to hypoxia (4-48 h) , and to MNNG (50 \u03bcM, 30 min). Neuron viability was visualized using the calcein/ethidium assay for live and dead cells. Hypoxia caused significant neuron death by 17 h and reduced survival to less than 10% by 48 h. Cell death was PARP-1-dependent as survival was significantly enhanced by both the PARP-1\u2212/\u2212 genotype and the PARP inhibitor, N- Ndimethylacetamide.HCl (PJ34) . Hypoxia (48 h) also enhanced Bnip3 protein expression nearly 3-fold in a manner abolished by PARP-1 deletion and PJ34 (10 \u03bcM) treatment, indicating that hypoxic Bnip3 expression is dependent on PARP-1. Using direct PARP-1 activation with MNNG in normal oxygen, we found reduced neuronal survival that was concentration and time-dependent. Importantly, significant neuron death, first seen between 4 and 6 h after MNNG, was preceded by a 3-fold increase in Bnip3 protein expression at 4 h that was blocked by genetic PARP-1 deletion.",

Using this model we find that reduced Beclin 1 levels in microglia decreases both the number of cells that phagocytose beads and the number of internalized beads per cell. Impaired internalization of beads in Beclin 1 deficient microglia appears to specifically result from defects in phagocytosis since endocytosis of transferrin receptors is not impaired. Importantly, phagocytic defects in Beclin 1 deficient microglia can be reversed by rescuing Beclin 1 levels via a Beclin 1 overexpressing lentivirus. Using an ex-vivo amyloid precursor protein (APP) brain slice model, we also find that Beclin 1 deficient microglia are less efficient at degrading cortical and hippocampal AB. Impaired AB clearance by Beclin 1 deficient microglia cannot be explained by deficits in lysosomal function or cellular migration, both of which were comparable with control cells, suggesting that Beclin 1 regulates intrinsic cellular machinery required for phagocytosis.",

In the central nervous system (CNS), physiological citrullination of myelin basic protein (MBP) ensures the function of myelin: 20% of the total MBP is citrullinated.Pathological citrullination of MBP results in more open conformation, increased susceptibility to cleavage, and exposes epitopes to the immune system. Citrullinated MBP has been demonstrated in degenerative CNS diseases and scrapie.If not the cause, citrullination of MBP may be a facilitator of epitope spreading and worsening of multiple sclerosis (MS): T cell response to citrullinated MBP is stronger in MS compared to control subjects. Thus, citrullination of MBP may be important in demyelinating diseases. However adult MS patients who have been tested for anti-CCP were found negative.

At 15 p.m., a second blood sample of 12 ml was obtained from each donor of both groups. In all blood samples, several neutrophil functions of the phagocytic process were studied, such as the endothelial adhesion capacity, the spontaneous the mobility, the chemotaxis, the phagocytosis of inert particles, the phagocytic efficiency and the basal and stimulated superoxide anion levels. The results of the control group showed a significant functionality decrease of neutrophils from 10 a.m. to 15 p.m. in parameters such as spontaneous mobility, chemotaxis and basal superoxide anion levels. This circadian rhythm was modified by the OMT, since functions of the control group that did not change between 10 a.m. to 15 p.m. experienced a decrease (endothelial adhesion capacity) or an increase (phagocytosis and stimulated superoxide anion levels) in the treated group. Moreover, functions that decreased at 15 p.m. in the control group, were stimulated at the same time in the OMT group, reaching similar or higher levels than those at 10 a.m.",

To investigate the clinical characteristics of elderly-onset myasthenia gravis (MG) older than 60 at onset in China. Methods: Of 672 MG recruited into this study were followed from June 2004 to May 2008. We identified 103 cases with onset of the disease after the age of 60 (elderly-onset MG, EOMG) and 419 cases with onset of the disease between 18 and 59 (adult-onset MG, AOMG). For all patients, demographic data (gender, age at diagnosis), age of onset of disease and course of diagnosis, clinical features of MG, Osserman's classification, disease severity according to recommendations for clinical research standards, presence of other associated disorders, and choice of therapy were recorded. Results: EOMG patients were 15.55% of our series, male/female ratio was 0.94, age at onset ranged from 60 to 85 years. The first complaints in EOMG patients were most commonly extraocular paralysis. At maximum severity of the disease, 63 EOMG patients (61.17%) had generalized MG (GMG). The proportion of GMG in EOMG patients is less than in AOMG patients at maximum severity of the disease (X2 = 9.10,P b 0.01). CT scan of the thymus in 70 EOMG patients revealed thymoma in 15 patients. The EOMG group had less thymoma than the AOMG group. Fifty-one EOMG patients (49.51%) were associated with other medical diseases, compared with 59 cases (14.08%) in AOMG group (X2 = 62.41,P b 0.01). Twenty-eight of 103 EOMG patients (27.18%) were treated with pyridostigmine only. Glucocorticoid was used in 31 EOMG patients (30.10%), and this was significantly less than the 62.53% in AOMG group (X2 = 35.32, P b 0.01). Immunosuppressant (such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine A, or tacrolimus) was used in 57 EOMG patients (55.34%). Thymectomy was performed in 18.45% EOMG patients, and this was significantly less than the 36.52% in AOMG group (X2 = 12.22,P b 0.01). Conclusions: Characteristics of EOMG comprise higher frequency of ocular forms at onset, less proportion of GMG at maximum severity of the disease, more proportion of association with other medical diseases, limited usage of glucocorticoid and thymectomy, and more usage of immunosuppressant.

The concentration of Mn in schizophrenic patients was not changed significantly (p N 0.05) compared to that of the controls. But the concentration of Zn decreased significantly in schizophrenic patients (p b 0.05) when compared with the control group. Ca level was also lower in schizophrenic patients (p b 0.05). The changes in hair concentrations of Zn, Ca, and Mn may have some prognostic significance for the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Socioeconomic data reveals that most of the patients were poor, middle-aged, and divorced. Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of the control group (22.2673 \u00b1 1.91898) and the patient group (20.4257 \u00b1 3.16744) was within the normal range (18.5 -25.0 kg/m2). Pearson's correlation analysis suggested that only Ca concentration of patients had a significant inverse correlation with the BMI (r = 0.613; p = 0.000), which was further justified from the regression analysis (R2 = 0.376; t = 3.411; p = 0.002) and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test (F = 5.211; p = 0.006).",

The cohort consecutively enrolled 2350 MG patients who were regularly followed for at least six months. The mean time of follows-up was 6.5 years. Fifty-one patients developed extrathymic tumors, 47 of which (2%) developed extrathymic malignancies. The incidence of malignancies in our cohort was significantly higher than in common Chinese population both for men (p b 0.01) and women (p b 0.01). The malignancies included lung cancer (19), breast cancer (3), liver cancer (3), gastric cancer (2), brain glioma (2), other solid malignant tumors (9), and metastatic tumors of undetermined sources (7). Tumors were diagnosed between 1-10 years prior to the diagnosis of MG in 5 patients, or 0.5-22 years after the diagnosis of MG in 35 patients, or concurrently with the diagnosis of MG in 7 patients. Thymoma was found in 295 patients (12.6%). The incidence was significantly higher in males (31/1156) than in females (16/1194) (p b 0.05).

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease leading to demyelination and neurodegeneration of the central nervous system with a significant heritable component. Recent genome-wide association studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) as multiple sclerosis risk-conferring gene variants besides the HLA-DRB1*1501 haplotype. Among a few others, SNPs in the gene encoding the alpha-chain of the IL-7 receptor (IL7R-alpha) are associated with MS risk. Four SNPs, including rs6897932, are sufficient to describe all common haplotypes. SNP rs6897932 affects the splicing of IL7R and leads to changes in the ratio between the membrane-bound and soluble IL7R-alpha isoform. While it can be speculated that these changes affect the function of the IL-7/ IL7R interaction, i.e. support of homeostatic proliferation of T cells and protection from apoptosis, the exact functional consequences and how they contribute to MS risk are largely unknown.",

The participants underwent a neurological examination, answered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and performed the Brief-Smell Identification Test (B-SIT). A cut-off score of B-SITb8 (i.e., b1st percentile of healthy demographically matched subjects) was used to classify hyposmia. Non-parametric tests (i.e., Fisher's Exact and Mann-Whitney) were used to analyze the results.Results: Impaired odor identification was found in 13.5% SLE and 9.5% MS patients. SLE patients with hyposmia had higher levels of depression (p = 0.001) and anxiety (p = 0.008). Impaired odor identification in SLE was associated with current intake of benzodiazepines (100% vs. 36.2%; p = 0.002), but not with antidepressant or prednisone therapies, nor with age, education, disease duration or overt CNS involvement. MS patients with hyposmia had higher levels of depression (p = 0.012), but not increased anxiety (p = 0.673). Hyposmia in MS was related with higher age (p = 0.001), lower education (p = 0.006), longer disease duration (p = 0.002), higher disability (EDSS; p = 0.001), faster disease progression (MSSS; p = 0.009), and course of disease (3.5% RR, 66.6% SP, 10% PP; p b 0.001). No significant associations were found with antidepressant, benzodiazepine or prednisone therapies. Conclusions: The present study documented odor identification deficits in SLE and MS patients and provided evidence for an association between hyposmia and depression on both diseases. These findings are consistent with the literature. Pause and colleagues (2001) reported that patients with major depression had low olfactory thresholds. The resection of the olfactory bulb in rodents has been found to result in depression-like behaviors (Kelly et al., 1997; Song & Leonard, 2005 To assess the prevalence and characteristics of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in primary Sj\u00f6grens syndrome (PSS) as compared with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).",

To elucidate the mechanisms of Th17 skewing, na\u00efve T cells were co-cultured with bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) from wild type or Sema4A KO mice. IL-17 producing T cells were significantly reduced when co-cultured with Sema4A-null BMDC, which suggested that the Sema4A expressed on DC is important for the Th17 differentiation. Although Sema4A KO mice exhibited milder clinical symptoms when EAE was induced, administration of recombinant Sema4A exacerbated EAE. Thus DC derived Sema4A is suggested to participate in Th17 skewing and exacerbation of the disease.",

Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. A complex network of interacting proinflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines plays an important role in its pathogenesis. The aim of our study is to analyze the relation between the serum levels of TNF-alfa, IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 and the phases of MS-exacerbation and remission. Methods: We studied 35 women (age between 18 and 50 years) with relapsing-remitting MS according to McDonald criteria. Thirteen of them were treated with interferon-beta-1b. The control group included 35 healthy women at the same age. Serum TNF-alfa, IFNgamma, IL-4 and IL-10 were quantified by ELISA. Results: The TNFalfa-concentration was significantly higher at relapse than at remission. Reciprocal changes were found in IL-4 concentration: increased serum level at remission, compared to exacerbation. Women with MS had higher IL-10 at relapse and lower TNF-alfa at remission than the controls. The cytokine profile of patients, treated with interferon-beta-1b significantly differed from the untreated group: patients with IFN-beta-1b had lower levels of TNF-alfa and IFN-gamma at relapse and higher levels of TNF-alfa and IL-10 at remission, compared to the untreated ones. There was no correlation between TNF-alfa, IL-10, IFN-gamma and the EDSS score. Conclusions: Serum concentrations of TNF-alfa and IL-4 objectively reflect the activity of immune system during both clinical periods of MS-exacerbation and remission. Treatment with IFN-beta-1b changes the serum cytokine profile of MS patients. The degree of disability, measured by EDSS does not depend on serum levels of TNF-alfa, IL-10 and IFN-gamma.",

Furthermore, the level and effect of ganglioside depletion will offer insight into the recycling/resynthesis rate of gangliosides, their function in maintenance of the steady state nerve and how crucial they are in the developing or regenerating nerve.

The reduction in noggin expression may be linked to the inefficient neuro-regeneration and remyelination that is related to the clinical progression of the disease. Anti-Yo antibodies, reactive with Purkinje cells, are associated exclusively with paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. In contrast, anti-Hu antibodies react with antigens found in all neurons and are associated with multiple paraneoplastic neurological disorders. The roles of these two antibodies in causing paraneoplastic neuronal injury are not known, however; and their investigation in animal models is made difficult by the presence of the blood-brain barrier, which complicates exposure of neurons to antibody over time. An alternate approach to studying the interaction of paraneoplastic autoantibodies with target neuronal populations is through the use of cerebellar slice (organotypic) cultures, since this culture system preserves anatomical relationships present in vivo and allows exposure of neurons to antibodies without interposition of the blood-brain barrier.

In the central nervous system, astrocytes are key mediators of neuroinflammation and several studies imply that NF-\u03baB activation in GFAPpositive cells is a central step in promoting neuroinflammation. However, it is not clear whether astrocytic NF-\u03baB itself is sufficient to drive neuroinflammatory processes, or if it is only a modulator/ enhancer of the inflammatory response to neuropathological insults. Furthermore, the function of astrocytic NF-\u03baB during neural development is not well defined.

Understanding the players involved in leukocyte penetration into the CNS is particularly important because their modulation may offer therapeutic alternatives for chronic neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In the animal model of MS, the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the Fractalkine/CX3CR1 system seems to be critical in mediating the trafficking of NK cells into the CNS.

Although it has been established that progression of the disease is accompanied by sustained activation of microglia, the underlying molecules and factors involved in these immune-triggered mechanisms remain largely unexplored. Lately, accumulating evidence has shown the presence of extracellular \u03b1-Syn both in its aggregated and monomeric forms in cerebrospinal fluid and blood plasma. However, the effect of extracellular \u03b1-Syn on cellular activation and immune mediators, as well as the impact of familial PD-linked \u03b1-Syn mutants on this stimulation, remains largely unknown. In this work, for the first time, we have studied the activation profile of monomeric, extracellular \u03b1-Syn on primary glial and microglial cell cultures. After \u03b1-Syn-stimulation of cells, we measured the release of Th1-and Th2-type cytokines as well as IP-10/ CXCL10, RANTES/CCL5, MCP-1/CCL2 and MIP-1\u03b1/CCL3 chemokines. Contrary to what had been observed using cell lines or for the case of aggregated \u03b1-Syn, we found strong differences in the immune response generated by wild-type \u03b1-Syn and the familial PD mutants (A30P, E46K and A53T), which might explain the differences in the onset and progression of this highly debilitating disease. Axonal damage is considered as the major cause of chronic disability in MS but the underlying pathological mechanisms are poorly understood. Similar to immune-mediated myelin destruction, autoimmunity to neuronal and axonal antigens may play an important role. Our recent studies in mice have revealed that experimental autoimmunity to the axonal protein neurofilament light (NF-L) induces spastic paresis, axonal damage and neurodegeneration [Huizinga et al. 2007 [Huizinga et al. , 2008 . In this model grey matter lesions are frequently observed as they are in MS and, interestingly, immunoglobulin (Ig) deposits occur inside neurons and axons. Like in MS grey matter lesions, T cell infiltrates in the CNS of NF-L immunised mice are rare.",

The loss of TCR a\u03b2+ cells also impacted the profiles of infiltrating innate immune cells primarily during the late phase of infection. Specifically, neutrophil and gd T cell infiltrates were significantly increased in brain abscesses of TCR a\u03b2 KO mice compared to WT animals, whereas macrophage infiltrates were reduced in TCR a\u03b2 KO mice following S. aureus infection and expressed lower levels of MHC Class II and co-stimulatory molecules. Adoptive transfer of purified CD4+ Th cells into TCR a\u03b2 KO mice was able to restore the defects in bacterial clearance and immune cell recruitment to levels typically observed in WT animals. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed a dramatic reduction in brain abscess volume in TCR a\u03b2 KO mice, suggesting a pivotal role for TCR a\u03b2+ cells in mediating tissue injury.",

There are limited data on the predictive factors of prognosis in ADEM and a significant portion are subsequently diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) or neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Methods: We performed a retrospective review of all patients diagnosed with ADEM in Johns Hopkins Hospital between Jan1997 and Feb 2010. Search terms were ADEM, post-infectious encephalitis and post-vaccination encephalitis. Clinical status and outcomes were collected from chart review or telephone follow-up. Results: Twenty-four patients were initially diagnosed with ADEM. The average time of follow-up was 37.8 months (ranged 3 days-144 months). The median age was 26.5 year old (ranged 33 months-66 years old). There were 10 pediatric patients (ageb18 years old). Five patients ultimately had their diagnoses revised to either MS or NMO. Five of the nineteen patients had histopathological confirmation of ADEM on brain biopsy or autopsy. There was no significant difference in clinical presentations between ADEM and MS/NMO groups, including the presence of encephalopathy. Deep grey matter involvement in neuroimaging was present in 37% (7/19) in ADEM but none in MS/NMO and periventricular involvement was similar in the 2 groups. The nineteen ADEM patients were dichotomized into those with good outcome, achieving an EDSS b4 (thirteen patients) and poor outcome with EDSSN4 (six patients). Strikingly all patients in the poor outcome group had an EDSS = 8. The mean age for good outcome patients was 20.85 \u00b1 5.0 vs 42 \u00b1 7.8 years with poor outcome (p = 0.03); severe obtundation was noted in 1/13 = 7.7% vs 4/ 6 = 66.7% (p = 0.004). There were no differences in the white matter involvement between the 2 groups nor did the extent of CSF pleocytosis predict outcomes. Treatment was no different between the 2 groups. Two patients received no treatment and had dramatic resolution of their symptoms with improvement of neuroimaging abnormalities. Three patients had recurrent ADEM.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a broadly expressed integral membrane glycoprotein that is proteolytically processed during anterograde axonal transport in neurons to yield various peptide subunits. APP has been used as an early and sensitive marker for axonal damage in immunohistochemical studies. The post-translational products of APP have been associated with different physiological functions, one of which is amyloid-\u03b2. The most well studied role for amyloid-\u03b2 is in the senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-\u03b2 is neurotoxic, causes oxidative stress, and can inhibit synaptic functions like long-term potentiation.

We now use experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of MS, to determine the role of APP and its products in contributing to disease pathogenesis. We show that mRNA expression levels of APP significantly increase during EAE. During acute disease, APP mRNA levels increase by 1.5-fold in the brain and 3.2-fold in the spinal cord, compared to na\u00efve controls. During remission and chronic disease, there is no significant change from naive controls.

It also suggested that escin appeared to be neuroprotective against cerebral ischemia by a reduction of inflammatory reaction in diabetic rats. (The study was supported by International S&T Cooperation Program of China, 2009DFA31100). Fractalkine (FKN), the CX3C chemokine, is the exclusive ligand for the CX3C receptor (CX3CR1) and has recently been identified as a key neuroimmune regulatory molecule. This chemokine is expressed on neurons while CX3CR1 is found on microglia, and the interaction between FKN and CX3CR1 is thought to maintain microglia in a resting state, thereby suppressing the neurotoxic activity of these cells. Decreased protein levels of FKN have been found in the aged brain, as well as in the plasma of patients with Alzheimers disease. It is our hypothesis that a disruption in FKN-CX3CR1 signaling is a key trigger of microglia activation during aging, which leads to cognitive impairment and suppression of neurogenesis. Recently we have shown that CX3CR1 null mice have decreased hippocampal neurogenesis compared to controls. It has been suggested that the agerelated decrease in hippocampal neurogenesis together with the decline in other types of synaptic plasticity contribute to a disruption in memory function and that altered microglial function may play a causative role in nuerodegeneration in aging and disease.",

To further examine if CX3CR1 deficiency results in cognitive deficits we tested the mice on a number of behavioral tasks including contextual fear conditioning. When compared to WT, CX3CR1 null mice showed reduced freezing to context, normal freezing to a cue, normal open field behavior and normal behavior on an elevated plus maze, suggesting selective loss of hippocampal dependent memory function. To test if loss of CX3CL1 resulted in similar deficits as those found in the receptor null mice we injected FKN null mice with BrdU (100 mg/kg) for a three-day period to analyze proliferating cells into the SGZ.

Traditionally autoimmunity has been regarded as detrimental, where the prototypical example of an immune mediated disease of the CNS is multiple sclerosis. However, emerging data clearly demonstrate that autoimmunity may exert neuroprotective effects after mechanical nerve injuries. Previously, our group was able to map strain differences in MHC class II expression in a model of nerve axotomy to the MHC class II transactivator (Ciita) gene.",

The MHC complex did not exert a significant effect at the mRNA level. Notably, however, at the protein level the PVG.RT1av1 strain displayed much lower MHC II labeling using the OX6 antibody than the PVG strain, dwarfing the effect of c2ta. The expression of CD3 (T-cells) on rtPCR, 6 days after TBI was higher, however not significantly, in the PVG strain compared to the DA strain and correlated strongly with expression of IL-10. Genetic effects on the expression of other inflammatory mediators were also seen. Additional characterization using flow cytometry is underway.",

Junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A), a transmembrane glycoprotein that is expressed in endothelial and epithelial cells, platelets and leukocyte subsets, has been shown to mediate leukocyte extravasation across the endothelium. We therefore addressed the role of JAM-A in the immunopathogenesis of EAE, with a special focus on leukocyte trafficking across the BBB using JAM-A\u2212/\u2212 C57BL/6 mice.",

Muscle fiber damage is a hallmark of autoimmune myositis. It is known that multi-nucleated cells, such as myocytes are relatively resistant to classical forms of apoptosis. Factors that initiate cell-death in myositis are not well defined; therefore we propose that autophagic, as opposed to apoptotic cell death may play a role in this muscle fiber damage. Recent literature indicates that tumornecrosis-factor-alpha related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) may induce not only NF\u03baB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells) activation but also autophagic cell death in other culture model systems. We have investigated the role of TRAIL in cell death and pathogenesis in vitro with cell culture and in vivo with human muscle biopsies and mouse muscle tissues. Gene expression profiling of multiple human myopathies indicated that expression of TRAIL and several markers of autophagy were specifically upregulated in myositis muscle tissue; these results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. We also analyzed TRAIL induced cell death (apoptosis and autophagy) and NF\u03baB activation in vitro in cultured cells. We have found that TRAIL was expressed predominantly in myositis muscle fibers, but not in biopsies from normal or other dystrophic diseased muscle. Likewise, autophagy markers such as Beclin and LC3 were upregulated in human and the mouse model of myositis. TRAIL expression was restricted to regenerating/atrophic areas of muscle fascicles, blood vessels, and infiltrating lymphocytes. TRAIL induced NF\u03baB activation and I\u03baB degradation in cultured cells and these were resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis but undergo autophagic cell death. The small molecule I\u03baB inhibitor (BMS-345541) efficiently blocked TRAIL-induced NF\u03baB nuclear translocation in cultured cells. Our data demonstrate that TRAIL is expressed in autoimmune myositis muscle, but not in other muscle disease biopsies. TRAIL expression is restricted to regenerating muscle fibers and may likely mediate both the activation of NF\u03baB in myositis and the autophagic cell death in multinucleated muscle cells. TRAIL may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in autoimmune myositis.",

Further screening will clarify the pathogenic role of antibodies against Caspr-2 or other surface proteins in cerebellar syndromes. Detection of antibody secreting plasma cells (ASC) and antibodies in the central nervous system (CNS) are a common hallmark of viral infections and autoimmune mediated disorders. Despite increasing evidence for plasma cell accumulation and survival in the CNS, little is known about the signals that recruit ASC into the brain. Using a neurotropic coronavirus, we demonstrate a nonredundant role for the chemokine receptor CXCR3 in mediating ASC accumulation in the CNS. ASC were measured by flow cytometry, ELISPOT and immunohistochemistry of infected CNS tissue. Infected CXCR3 deficient mice exhibited an~80% reduction in both total and virus-specific ASC in the brain and spinal cord supporting a role for sustained, elevated expression of CXCR3 ligands CXCL-9 and -10 in the persistently infected CNS. By contrast, peripheral ASC responses and accumulation of ASC in bone marrow were not impaired and even enhanced relative to wt mice. Furthermore, virus-specific serum antibody levels including neutralizing antibodies were similar to wt controls confirming that CXCR3deficiency primarily results in a migratory defect to sites of inflammation. Although CD8 T cell infiltration into the CNS was transiently reduced early during infection, numbers and localization of CD4 and CD8 T cells in spinal cords was similar in both CXCR3-deficient and wt mice at the time corresponding to peak ASC accumulation. Impaired ASC recruitment coincided with elevated levels of persisting viral RNA and increased clinical disease and mortality.",

Neutrophils are essential effector cells in the first line of defence against invading microorganisms. They encounter and kill microbes intracellularly by phagocytosis and extracellularly by degranulation. Recently, the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been discovered as a new killing mechanism. NETs are extracellular fibres composed of chromatin and granule proteins that are able to catch and kill microbes. NET formation requires chromatin decondensation and histone citrullination that is mediated by the deiminase PAD4. Despite the beneficial role of NETs during infections, its composition including TLR ligands (autologous DNA and bacterial compounds) together with self proteins (histones and neutrophil compounds) could also have harmful effects facilitating autoimmunity.",

TLR-mediated activation enhances cell surface expression of costimulatory molecules and induces the production of a variety of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Extracellular adenosine can modulate the TLR-induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through adenosine receptor (ADORA)-mediated signaling. Four ADORA subtypes have been described that can either increase (A2AR and A2BR) or decrease (A1R and A3R) intracellular cAMP levels. Previously, we have reported that TLR-mediated activation dramatically alters the ADORA expression pattern on primary microglia resulting in strongly enhanced sensi-tivity for the inhibitory effects of extracellular adenosine on TLRinduced cytokine production. While A2AR-mediated signaling was found to be responsible for the inhibitory effect, an important new counteracting role for A3R-mediated signaling was also identified.",

Preliminary results using short interference RNA to reduce A3R protein confirmed the necessity of A3Rmediated signaling for TLR4-induced IL12 production. Interestingly, analysis in bone marrow-derived macrophages and in human monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells showed similar results, suggesting that the proposed effect is not exclusive for microglia.

We propose that a TLR-induced rapid rise in endogenously produced extracellular adenosine levels provides microglia with a second signal which is necessary to trigger IL12 production. This novel fail-safe mechanism thereby closely resembles the two signals (i.e. a TLR stimulus and a rise in extracellular ATP that signals through P2X7) that are needed to trigger inflammasome-mediated IL1beta production. Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a single-stranded RNA virus, causes a chronic progressive CD4+ T cell mediated induced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD) in susceptible mouse strains, serving as a virally-induced murine model of the human disease Multiple sclerosis. The innate immune system serves as the first line of host defense against pathogens such as viruses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs), members of the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) family, recognize pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and ligand binding activates pro-inflammatory and antiviral responses on APCs. Central nervous system (CNS)-resident cells, microglia isolated from human and neonatal murine tissue express multiple TLRs in vitro and in situ. Therefore, we examined TLRstimulated microglia and macrophage immune functions in the murine CNS in response to TMEV infection.",

These data suggests viruses may selectively upregulate expression of TLR3 for mounting antiviral responses, which is necessary for TMEV viral clearance in the CNS. To further elucidate the role of TLR3 in TMEV-IDD, we examined the development of induced demyelinating disease in its absence (TLR3\u2212/\u2212SJL). Compared to wild-type SJL mice, TLR3\u2212/\u2212SJL mice are hypersusceptible to disease and exhibit increased demyelination, suggesting TLR3 is protective against TMEV-IDD. Additionally, TLR3\u2212/\u2212SJL mice are defective in TMEV clearance in the CNS, as measured by increased viral titers in TLR3\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild-type controls.

We thus hypothesized that estrogens exert beneficial effects by acting as anti-inflammatory agents. We initially showed that inflammatory cells, including microglia, express the estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta, and that estrogen inhibits the transcription of inflammatory genes. Using an experimental model of acute brain inflammation, we demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol reduces the activation of brain inflammatory cells in vivo and that this effect is specifically mediated by ERalpha. More recent data on hormone withdrawal and replacement with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) show that estrogens anti-inflammatory activity can be reproduced by SERMs generally used in clinical practice. In parallel, using the APP23 mice, an animal model of Alzheimer's disease, we observed that the endogenous estrogens status clearly regulates the brain inflammatory response associated with this chronic neuroinflammatory disease. Our most recent data on neuroinflammation in the aging brain and the role of experimental menopause will be discussed. Altogether, our studies show that estrogens act as anti-inflammatory signals in brain. These results may be useful to identify more selective ligands and appropriate therapeutic interventions for the prevention of neuroinflammatory pathologies in the aging women.

Moreover, NK cells recruited to the site of inoculation exhibited an activated phenotype, including enhanced CD69, CD62L, CD27, NKG2D, and Ly49D staining compared to PBS treated mice. This robust NK response was confirmed to be detrimental to OV efficacy through the enhanced survival of NK depleted mice inoculated with OV compared to OV treated mice possessing NK cells (median survival 31.6 days compared to median survival 23.6 days, p = 0.04). Interestingly, OV treated mice exhibited robust induction in macrophage/ microglial derived gene expression of CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, TNF-a, and iNOS. However, when mice were depleted of their NK cells, the expression of these genes was reduced to basal levels.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system which leads to focal destruction of myelin. The earliest changes which cause lesion formation are still not known. The study of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in lesion formation is complex due to the multifactorial nature of disease susceptibility, the heterogeneity of clinical disease course and the diversity of the cellular pathology. Recent studies on active demyelinating MS lesions revealed profound heterogeneity in immunopathological patterns of demyelination. The hypothesis of interindividual heterogeneity is challenged by the description of a stage-dependent sequence of pathological features in a small sample of MS autopsy cases. Although similar lesional features are observed in both MS patient cohorts, there are several arguments that support the hypothesis of intraindividual homogeneity and interindividual heterogeneity including pathological and radiological data as well as response to therapy. The basis for this interindividual heterogeneity may be the presence of distinct molecular and immunological effector mechanisms MS lesions and normal appearing white matter. Since the initial events in MS lesion formation are not yet defined, the elucidation of these molecular mechanisms, is important for establishing new therapeutic regimens that specifically interfere with these processes.

Clinical, pathological and serologic features, including the presence of NMO-IgG, targeting the dominant CNS water channel, aquaporin-4 (AQP4), distinguish NMO from MS. AQP4 is concentrated in the plasma membrane of the astrocytic endfeet that abut capillaries and pia in the brain and spinal cord, particularly in the subpial and subependymal zones, as well as in the glial lamellae of the supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus. These are sites of distinctive brain MRI abnormalities observed in a subset of NMO patients. NMO pathology demonstrates variable demyelination and axonal injury, eosinophil/neutrophil infiltration, as well as a unique vasculocentric pattern of immune complex deposition, localizing to astrocytic endfeet in the perivascular glia limitans, reflecting the regional density of AQP4 molecules. In contrast to a stage-dependent loss of AQP4 in MS lesions, NMO lesions demonstrate AQP4 loss, regardless of the stage of demyelinating activity. AQP4 loss is also observed at sites of vasculocentric Ig deposition and complement activation in NMO lesions that largely lack demyelination, but are inflammatory. Such lesions have a predilection for periventricular regions, especially the medullary floor of the fourth ventricle and adjacent area postrema, a region lacking a blood-brain barrier (BBB) and rich in osmoreceptors. These lesions likely represent the pathological substrate for the intractable, but reversible, nausea and vomiting reported in some NMO patients. Supratentorial MRI brain lesions have also been described in NMO, which are either nonspecific or MS-like in appearance. These supratentorial NMO lesions pathologically resemble NMO opticospinal lesions with respect to the type of inflammation, the presence of perivascular immune complex deposits and the loss of AQP4, in a pattern distinct from that observed in MS and ADEM, and do not support an overlap of NMO with either MS or ADEM, as has been suggested by some studies. Paradoxically, cortical demyelination is absent in NMO, despite the abundant expression of AQP4 in this region. Regional differences in AQP4 concentration could contribute to this paradox, as well as regional differences in the spatial distribution or molecular orientation of AQP4 epitopes on astrocytic endfeet that might preclude efficient complement activation or intermolecular cross-linking at some sites. In keeping with in vitro studies demonstrating that exposure to NMO patient serum and active complement compromises the membrane integrity of CNS-derived astrocytes, NMO lesions are characterized by loss of astrocytes. NMO lesions also demonstrate a marked reduction in EAAT2 colocalizing to regions of AQP-4 loss. These pathological findings, coupled with the observation that AQP4 is endocytosed following binding of NMO-IgG, with concomitant loss of Na-dependent glutamate transport and loss of the excitatory transporter, suggest EAAT2 and AQP4 exist in astrocytic membranes as a macromolecular complex. Binding of NMO-IgG to astrocytic AQP4 could therefore be expected to disrupt glutamate homeostasis and lead to injury to oligodendrocytes that express calcium-permeable glutamate receptors.",

            "text": "Glial cells that engage with long axons are a feature of virtually all nervous systems. However, the mechanisms by which neurons and glia communicate troughout life are not well understood. In the CNS, there is increasing evidence that oligodendrocytes support long-term axon function and survival, which is relevant for human myelin diseases. Patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) suffer from slowly progressive loss of axons in inflammatory demyelinating lesions. This raises the question whether inflammation, demyelination, oligodendrocyte dysfunction, or any combination thereof is the underlying cause of axonal failure (Trapp and Nave, Annu Rev Neurosci., 2008) . Acute inflammation, such as in EAE mice, perturbs the energy balance of demyelinated axons. However, genetic observations suggest that oligodendrocytes themselves maintain long-term axonal integrity, independent of myelination and inflammation. Moreover, genetic defects of oligodendrocytes not only cause axon loss, but can trigger themselves a secondary inflammation that includes the invasion of activated CD8+ T cells into the white matter (Kassmann et al., Nat Genet 2007) . The molecular mechanism of how oligodendrocytes support axon function is not well understood. The phenotype of axonal swellings and Wallerian degeneration in mouse models resembles those in patients with mitochondrial defects. To study possible contributions of oligodendrocytes in maintaining the axonal energy balance in myelinated fibers (Nave, Nat Rev Neurosci, 2010), we have created novel mouse models lacking mitochondrial respiration (Supported by ELA, EU-FP6 'Neuropromise', EU-FP7 'Leukotreat', and BMBF 'Leukonet').",

            "text": "Some encephalitides and seizure disorders once thought idiopathic now appear to be immune mediated. The target antigens are cell surface or synaptic receptors that have critical roles in synaptic transmission and plasticity such as the excitatory glutamate receptors, NMDAR and AMPAR, and the inhibitory GABAB receptor. The spectrum of associated symptoms varies with the target antigen and may include alterations of memory, behavior, cognition, psychosis, seizures, and dyskinesias, all part of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Recognition of these disorders is important because they can affect children and young adults, may occur with and without cancer association, frequently respond to immunotherapy, and some antibodies define new syndromes (anti-NMDAR encephalitis). In the latter, the multistage development of symptom progression and improvement results in a syndrome so characteristic that most patients are diagnosed on clinical grounds. Anti-NMDAR encephalitis is now widely recognized in children and adults, and the frequency of tumor association (usually teratomas) varies according to age (children rarely have tumors), gender and ethnicity. In contrast, the autoimmunities against AMPAR and GABA(B) receptor associate with a classical picture of limbic encephalitis or pure psychiatric manifestations, frequently triggered by an underlying cancer. Immunologically these disorders are characterized by 4 features: 1) the target epitopes are extracellular, 2) antibody-receptor binding is visible in cells transfected to express the target receptor, 3) the antibodies alter the structure or function of the target receptor, and 4) the clinical picture resembles pharmacologic or genetic models in which the receptor is disrupted. Given that the syndromes attributed to voltage-Lecture & Plenary Symposium gated potassium channels (VGKC) did not fulfill these criteria, we recently conducted studies to isolate the real target antigens. These resulted in the isolation of LGI1 (a epilepsy related gene which product is a secreted neuronal protein) as the main antigen of limbic encephalitis previously attributed to VGKC, and CASPR2 as the antigen of a form of encephalitis (sometimes defined as Morvan's syndrome) and a subgroup of patients with neuromyotonia. These findings reveal that under the term \"VGKC antibody associated syndromes\" there is a broad spectrum of clinical and immunological disorders that have started to be exposed. The implications of these findings will be further discussed. This talk will focus on the work on two recently discovered human autoimmune disorders of memory, learning, cognition, and psychosis in which the function of NMDA receptors or AMPA receptors is directly affected by a patient's antibodies directed against extracellular epitopes of specific receptor subunits. These disorders are naturally occurring models of human memory dysfunction that are unique: they are relatively frequent; cause severe memory loss; can be lethal but are potentially treatable; often affect children; are caused by serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibodies to extracellular domains of NMDA or AMPA receptor subunits that bind preferentially to hippocampus and surrounding cortex, but not generally or equally to all brain regions; and the accompanying acute-onset psychosis has hallmarks of schizophrenia. I will discuss our recent published work and unpublished results that establish the cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying these novel and life-threatening anti-glutamate receptor encephalopathies. I will present unpublished data that demonstrate that patient antibodies are themselves pathogenic, causing a dramatic, dose-dependent decrease in the density of surface and total glutamate receptor clusters and their synaptic localization, independent of complement, that are reversible after antibody removal. Antibodies do not affect the density of synapses, other synaptic protein clusters, dendritic branching/spine density, or cell survival. These and other results support the conclusion that antibodies from patients with anti-glutamate receptor encephalitis reversibly alter the density and synaptic localization of NMDA or AMPA receptors, and that these effects are mediated primarily by capping, cross-linking and internalization of receptors. I will also discuss our in vivo work in rodent models of these disorders, and the effects of patient antibodies on synapses and circuits in vivo. Using these approaches, our goal is to connect synaptic and circuit dysfunction with the behavioral abnormalities in cognition and memory that are hallmarks of these disorders.",

This immunosuppression has drawn attention as a potential therapeutic target. GBM may regulate immunity by modulating intrinsic and extrinsic cytokine production or by inducing a T-regulatory (T-reg) cell population which suppresses immune activity. Cytokines IL-12 and IL-23 are thought to play important roles in Tcell function. IL-12 stimulates Th1 cells to produce Interferon (IFN) gamma, which enhances anti-tumour immune response. IL-23 stimulates Th17 cells to produce IL-17, which may also be involved in tumour immunity. Functional expression of both cytokines has been demonstrated in astrocytes and our PCR studies suggest that in GBM, IL-23 production is increased relative to IL-12. This study aims to further delineate the role of these cytokines in GBM-mediated immunosuppression. T cell blasts were obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells harvested from healthy volunteers after stimulation with PHA followed by IL-2.

The paucity of immune cells found within the tumor bulk, has lead to the hypothesis that GBMs have an increased capacity to escape immune surveillance. Glioblastoma Cancer Precursor Cells (GBM-CPCs) can be isolated from GBM biopsies and express the surface marker CD133. Here, we hypothesize that GBM-CPCs impair proper differentiation of CD14+ monocytes into antigen presenting cells (APCs) through the expression of CD200 ligand, a known myeloid cells inhibitor. We processed 12 GBM tumor biopsies to isolate infiltrating lymphocytes and APCs, using a discontinuous isotonic percoll gradient",

Co-cultures of these neurospheres with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) selectively expanded the population of CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cells.

To examine possible alterations of glial GJ proteins during the course of inflammatory demyelination we studied the expression of connexin32 (Cx32), Cx43, and Cx47 in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS. EAE is characterized by inflammatory changes accompanied by demyelination and secondary axonal damage, as well as remissions and relapses.",

A peripheral immune response is also crucial in the pathophysiology of MS. Serotonin (5HT) is a classic neurotransmitter which also functions in inflammation and immunity. Present in immune cells, serotonin is important in mast cell and platelet function, and crosstalk between dendritic cells (DCs) and T lymphocytes(O'Connell et al.,  Blood 107-3:1010-17, 2006. Mining our transcriptomic and proteomic studies of MS brains for serotonin-related components showed that serotonin receptor (5HTR2) is decreased and the monoamine oxidase enzymes that degrade 5HT (MAO-A, MAO-B) are increased in MS, at the level of mRNA and protein expression(Lock et al., Nature  Medicine 8:500\u22128, 2002, and Han et al., Nature 451:1076\u221281, 2008 indicating possible down-regulation of 5HT activity in MS lesions. Fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT) inhibitor (or SSRI), shows a trend to decrease new enhancing lesions in human MS patients(Mostert et al., JNNP, 79(9):1027\u221231, 2008.",

The diagnoses were PML in 10 cases, cryptococcosis in 5 cases and TE in 3 cases. Four patients with PML-IRIS deceased with a median survival time of 3.9 months (2.5-112) .The pathophysiology of neuro-IRIS seems to be multifactorial. Among several pathogens associated with OI of the CNS, only intracellular pathogens such as JC virus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Cryptococcus neoformans and Toxoplasma gondii, are associated with neuro-IRIS development. Tuberculosis was underestimated in our study due to low endemicity of this pathogen in high-income countries. Genetic factors involved in anti-infectious immune responses might also predispose to IRIS. The excessive tissue inflammation that follows immune restoration is favoured by the defects observed in immune regulation mechanisms. Lymphopenia-induced proliferation and numerical and/or functional defects in regulatory T-cells might compromise the mechanisms that normally serve to maintain host tolerance, thereby favouring the initiation and the exacerbation of the immune response underlying neuro-IRIS. Tools to quantify and enumerate pathogen-specific immune cells prior and during ART should be very useful in improving the diagnosis and in predicting IRIS development. Novel therapeutic strategies that selectively alleviate inflammation without blunting immune restoration are warranted. In that respect, the combined antiviral and immunomodulatory characteristics of maraviroc, antagonist of the chemokine receptor CCR5, make it an attractive therapeutic approach that meets these requirements.",

Herein, we report four patients with NMO who underwent PP following intensive intravenous corticosteroid therapy.All patients showed definite functional improvement following one to five plasma exchanges. To prevent relapse, these patients were treated with oral prednisolone in combination with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide.

The antibody specifically binds to the VLA-4 antigen and inhibits T cell entry into the brain through diminishing extravasations at the endothelium. However, little is known about full biological effects of Natalizumab treatment on regulatory T cell activity and cytokine production. Our goal was to evaluate the longitudinal effects of Natalizumab on regulatory T cell activity and Th1/Th2 cytokine serum levels in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients.22 patients matched in sex and ages were included in a longitudinal exploratory study. Blood samples were obtained at baseline, at 2 hours, at 4 and 15 days, and also 1, 2, 5-6 and 9-12 months later. Patients underwent a complete neurological examination (EDSS) and cranial MRI every six months. CD4+ CD25hi FoxP3 + regulatory T cells were isolated from additional fresh blood samples obtained at baseline and one month later using Miltenyi Biotech purification Kit. Activity was determined as suppression of T cells proliferation previously stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Levels of Th1 and Th2-related cytokines (IL-1a, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-13, MCP-1, TGF and INF-gamma) were determined by Cytometric Bead Array. Samples were always obtained before intravenous infusion. Natalizumab was globally well tolerated. We did not found any significant association in regulatory T cell activity or frequency in the followed cohort of patients. Treated patients showed significant higher values of Th1 / Th2-related cytokines just few hours or days after the first IV-infusion (INFgamma and IL-5, p b 0.01; IL-12, p b 0.001, IL-4 and IL-10, p b 0.01). One year after starting treatment, some cytokines presented elevated levels, such us IL-1b, IL-2, IL-5 and IL-13 (p b 0.001).We have found increased serum levels of both Th1 and Th2-related cytokines just after first IV-infusions of Natalizumab. Globally, levels of cytokines tend to increase in response to treatment and some of them maintained elevated after one year. We observed no effects on frequency or activity of regulatory T cells. Although unclear, our results might have a relationship with undesirable adverse effects of Natalizumab.",

In addition, polymorphisms in the IL4 receptor gene are associated with survival rates of patients with glioblastoma, further suggesting that IL4-mediated signaling plays a role in the pathogenesis. This prompted us to study the effects of IL4 on the immune functions of microglia, the resident antigen presenting cells (APCs) of the brain.Primary microglia that were exposed to IL4 acquired an expression profile of cell surface molecules reminiscent of dendritic cells (DC), i.e. strongly reduced CD14 expression and enhanced expression of CD11c, CD83, CD86 and MHC classII. However, when probed for innate immune responses, these cells did not produce pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to TLR-mediated activation, irrespective of the TLR ligand used. This in marked contrast to primary microglia or monocyte-derived macrophages or DC generated from the same donors. Unexpectedly, NF-kappaB activation and nuclear translocation were found intact upon TLR engagement. We therefore screened for epigenetic alterations in IL4-exposed microglia and revealed that the expression profile of histone deacetylases (HDACs) was dramatically altered. Resetting of the altered HDAC profile by a targeted siRNA approach partially restored TLR-responsiveness. In situ analysis of a variety of brain tumors demonstrated that microglia in close proximity to the tumor were characterized by an altered expression profile of HDACs that closely resembled the profile we observed in vitro. Interestingly, when IL4-exposed microglia, either naive or TLRprimed, were used as APC in mixed lymphocyte reactions they potently induced the proliferation of Treg cells. Thus brain tumors might indirectly exploit the effects of IL4 on TLR responsiveness and APC function of microglia to suppress or subvert immune responses. Modulation of this pathway might represent an attractive novel therapeutic approach.",

Since the pathogenesis of PCD is largely unknown, we studied whether CDR2 cDNA sequence, mRNA or CDR2 protein levels in primary ovarian cancers were associated with serum antibodies to CDR2 (anti-Yo).We obtained serum samples and corresponding ovarian cancer tissue from 14 patients. Three of the ovarian cancer patients had Yo antibodies. We also studied CDR2 in other tissues. Similar CDR2 mRNA and protein levels were found in the ovarian cancers, as detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot. cDNA sequencing did not reveal any variants in the CDR2 coding sequence of the 14 ovarian cancers. Immunoblots also demonstrated CDR2 in normal ovarian tissue, in cell lines of ovarian cancer, lung cancer and neuroblastoma, and in normal human cerebellum, but not in human cerebrum. CDR2 was localized to the cytoplasma of the ovarian and lung cancer cell lines, whereas CDR2 was localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm in ovarian and colon cancer biopsies. However, CDR2 was also present on normal ovary stromal and epithelial cells.We found no post-transcriptional regulation of CDR2 in ovarian tissue or ovarian cancer. Furthermore, there was no association between CDR2 cDNA sequence, mRNA or protein level and Yo antibody production in ovarian cancer patients. This suggests that the immune regulation of Yo antibody synthesis is related to antigen presentation and T-cell regulation.",

We studied how this clinical information, which is readily available at the first consultation, can be used to predict the presence of SCLC.We included 219 LEMS patients: 107 Dutch LEMS patients (58 with SCLC), diagnosed between 1990 and 2008, from 1998 prospectively and a second cohort (n = 112, 46 with SCLC-LEMS) was collected in the UK (Oxford and Nottingham) to compare outcomes and external validity. We compared frequency and onset of symptoms early during the disease course of LEMS.Results Between onset of LEMS and three months, all clinical symptoms, neuromuscular and autonomic, were more prevalent in SCLC-LEMS patients than in NT-LEMS patients. Rapid involvement of proximal arm muscles (80% vs 32%), distal arm muscles (47% vs 8%), distal leg muscles (45% vs 10%), bulbar muscles (55% vs 16%), a dry mouth (80% vs 40%) and the presence of male sexual impotence (65% vs 32%) were found significantly more often in SCLC-LEMS patients in both cohorts (p b 0.001 for all symptoms). Cerebellar symptoms, Chronic microglial activation may play a role in the etiopathogenesis of Alzheimer's dementia and other neurodegenerative disorders. A role in modulating microglial activation could be ascribed to the serotoninergic system originating in the raphe nuclei located in the brainstem, which undergoes progressive neuro-degeneration along with amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaque accumulation in the cortex of APPswe/ PS1E9 transgenic (Tg) mice as demonstrated by Liu et al. (J Neurosci 28 (51)13805). Our hypothesis is that serotoninergic neurotransmission reduces A\u03b2-induced microglial activation and A\u03b2-plaques load in the cortex. Here, we investigated if the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) Paroxetine, which raises the amount of serotonin in the clefts of serotoninergic synapses in the cortex, administered per os to APPswe/ PS1E9 Tg and wildtype (Wt) mice over a period of 3 months, would be able to reduce A\u03b2-induced microglial activation and A\u03b2-plaque load in the cortex.APPswe/PS1E9 Tg and Wt mice were treated with Paroxetine (10 mg/kg) or vehicle (water) from 9 to 12 month of age. Monthly monitoring of drug levels by using mass spectrometry on eye vein samples showed that the levels of Paroxetine in serum were in the upper range of therapeutic levels (10-500 nM). Body weight and water intake were unaffected by the treatment. To allow monitoring of microglial proliferation, mice were injected with the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine 3 times over 24 hours prior to termination with anaesthesia and transcardial perfusion with 10 ml of PBS. The right hemisphere was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 24 hours, followed by 1% PFA for 24 hours. Next, the right hemisphere was put in 20% sucrose, frozen, cut into 50 \u03bcm thick sections and stored in Olmos solution at \u221214\u00b0C, ready to be stained for A\u03b2 and microglial CDllb and CD45. From the left hemisphere, hippocampus and cortex were processed for ELISA and qPCR for inflammatory markers. The first results show that the mRNA levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNFa in the cortex is significantly higher in vehicle treated Tg compared to vehicle treated Wt mice at 12 months. The 3 months administration of Paroxetine had no statistically significant effect on TNFa mRNA levels in neither Tg nor Wt mice. Similar results were obtained for cortical levels of IL-1\u03b2 mRNA.These data, prudently interpreted, indicate that 3 months treatment with Paroxetine has no effect on A\u03b2-induced microglial cytokine response in APPswe/PS1E9 Tg mice. The monocyte chemoattract protein-1/CCL2 (13 KDa) is a member of the CC chemokine family that acts like a potent quimiotactic factor for monocytes. The interaction with its receptor, CCR2, has been related to the pathogenesis of Multiple Sclerosis (MS). High levels of MCP-1/CCL2 in CSF and actively demyelinating lesions have been detected in patients with MS. Moreover, CCL2-deficient mice have been found to be markedly resistant to the induction of EAE, and the treatments with anti-CCL3 antibodies were efficacious in inhibiting EAE onset. Several studies support the potential therapeutic value of cannabinoids (CBs) in the treatment of MS and its experimental models but advances will be made in reducing CBs side effects, including unwanted psychoactivity. Then, studies with non-psychoactive cannabinoids are needed. Our current research is focusing on the study of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effect of CBs in leukocyte entry into the brain. Previous work from the lab has shown that CBs downregulate adhesion molecule expression in Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virusinduced demyelinating disease (TMEV-IDD). Because of the importance of MCP-1 in leukocyte infiltration we investigated in vivo modulation by non-psychotropic CBs like CBD and the cannabinomimetic compound palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) in TMEV-IDD.Our results showed a different expression profile of MCP-1/CCL2 and CCR2 during TMEV-IDD development (3, 7, 21, 35, 60, 90, 180 days post-infection) . Treatment with the non-psychoactive CBD at earlier stages diminishes MCP-1/CCL2 expression and reduces clinical score of TMEV-IDD. Our next step was to analyze the effects of CBD and PEA on the interaction of CCL2-CCR2 using an in vitro BBB model and its consequences in leukocytes infiltration. Our preliminary results showed that CBD decreases MCP-1 induced by TNFalpha/IL-1betha in astrocytes cultures.These results support the interest of using non-psychoactive cannabinoids as potential therapeutic agents in MS.",

Around 2-4 individuals/million/year are affected by HSE. It is characterized by severe focal brain inflammation and neurodegeneration. The contribution of a genetic component that regulates susceptibility to HSE, was identified by injecting human HSV-1 into the whiskers' area of DA and PVG.1AV1 inbred rat strains. Results show that DA rats were highly susceptible to HSE whereas the PVG.1AV1 strain is resistant. The model resembles the natural propagation of HSV-1 in humans; spreading from the lips via the trigeminal nerve to trigeminal ganglia and subsequently entering the central nervous system (CNS) to induce encephalitis.In the whiskers area, nerve endings were infected in both susceptible and resistant strain, however, differences of virus transport and replication in the host nerves and in the perineurial cells surrounding the nerve bundle were seen. In the susceptible DA rat, perineurial cells support replication and promote further spread to the trigeminal ganglia whereas in the resistant PVG.1AV1, these cells do not support the infection and therefore hamper the disease. Differences in the innate immune response and of Tlr2 and -9 expression were also observed.To identify the gene(s) regulating HSE, an F2 (DAxPVG.1AV1) was made. The individuals were challenged with HSV-1, resulting in a An interrelation of the two major hallmarks in sporadic inclusion body myositis (sIBM)-muscle, inflammation and b-amyloid-associated degeneration, has recently been described. The molecular basis of these interactions has so far remained elusive and is addressed in this study: High mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a transcriptional factor and \"alarmin\", has been demonstrated during skeletal muscle regeneration. Its receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) is relevant to bamyloid associated cell stress in Alzheimer's dementia.Muscle biopsies of patients with sIBM (n = 10), muscular dystrophy (n = 6) or healthy controls (n = 8) were studied. HMGB1-/RAGE-expression was analyzed by real time-PCR. Protein expression and co-localization to b-amyloid and tau/SMI-31 was detected by double-label immunohistochemistry of serial sections. Human primary myotubes and myoblasts were exposed to combinations of IL-1b, IFN-g, TNF-a, recombinant HMGB1 or BoxA peptide for 24 to 72 hours. HMGB1-/RAGE-expression and cell death were analyzed by real time-PCR, immunocytochemistry and/or FACS. Extracellular HMGB1 was quantified by ELISA. Amyloid-deposits and cell death were detected by thioflavin-S staining.On the levels of mRNA and protein, a significant overexpression of HMGB1 and RAGE was observed in sIBM-muscle compared to controls. Quantitative multi-parameter analysis of serially stained fibers revealed a significant co-localization of HMGB1 with RAGE as well as with accumulations of degeneration-associated molecules such as b-amyloid and tau/SMI-31. Upon exposure of muscle cells to a combination of IL-1b and IFN-g, HMGB1 entirely translocated from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and, as evidenced by ELISA of the supernatant, was significantly released. At the same time, an upregulation of the surface expression of RAGE was observed by immunocytochemistry and FACS. Compared to IL-1b + IFN-g, recombinant HMGB1 was equally potent in inducing intracellular accumulation of b-amyloid and subsequent cell death of muscle cells. The HMGB1 inhibitor BoxA significantly reduced accumulation of b-amyloid and cell death induced either by IFN-g + IL-1b or exogenous HMBG1.The data further our understanding of sIBM pathology and underscore that unique interactions between degenerative and inflammatory mechanisms are relevant. Our data suggest that in the network of sIBM pathomechanisms, signaling by HMGB1/RAGE is pivotal and may be efficiently targeted by inhibitors such as BoxA.",

            "text": "The roles of Nogo receptor-mediated interactions in autoimmune inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis The myelin-proteins Nogo-A and MAG are considered important inhibitors of nerve regeneration in the adult central nervous system (CNS) via Nogo receptor (NgR)-mediated interactions. Blocking strategies targeting this pathway have been successfully applied in several nerve injury models, suggesting Nogo-A and functionally related proteins like LINGO-1 as therapeutic targets to enhance regeneration in multiple sclerosis (MS). Especially anti-Nogo-A strategies have ameliorated the clinical outcome of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the established animal model of MS. However, whether and to what extent NgR-signaling is involved in mediating Nogo-A-related inhibition of neuroregeneration is currently under debate. To address this issue, we examined a potential function of NgR-mediated interactions on autoimmune CNS inflammation and regeneration of the damaged CNS.We induced EAE in NgR1\u2212/\u2212, NgR2\u2212/\u2212 and NgR1/2 doubledeficient mice, but did not observe a pronounced effect of NgR1-or NgR2-deficiency on the clinical outcome of EAE. Nevertheless, the composition of infiltrating immune cells was significantly changed in NgR1/2 double-deficient mice compared to wildtype littermate controls. Interestingly, an additional role besides inhibition of nerve regeneration has recently been described for NgR-mediated interactions on leukocyte trafficking into injured nervous tissue. Therefore, we investigated whether Nogo receptors or Nogo receptor ligands are expressed in the immune system, and how NgR-mediated interactions contribute to the inflammatory response in autoimmune CNS inflammation.The results of these studies will be discussed in the context of NgR-NgR-ligand interactions in the CNS versus the immune system. Blood-derived myeloid cells account for a significant proportion of the leukocytes found within perivascular infiltrates in CNS lesions of multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). These antigen-presenting cells (APCs) are thought to be pivotal in the initiation and perpetuation of the CNStargeted immune response in MS and EAE by promoting the reactivation of myelin-reactive T lymphocytes and by inducing tissue damage through the release of neurotoxic factors. However, the exact molecules that direct the trafficking of myeloid cells into the CNS remain largely unknown. Our goal was thus to identify the adhesion molecules that would specifically and exclusively inhibit the recruitment of myeloid cells into the CNS without affecting other leukocyte subsets, to minimize the occurrence of serious adverse events reported with the use of broad-spectrum adhesion molecule blockers.We identified nerve injury-induced protein-1 (Ninjurin-1) in a proteomic screen of human blood-brain barrier (BBB)-associated Workshops Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, Division of General Pathology, University of Verona, Verona, ItalyPantethine is the stable disulfate form of pantetheine, the metabolic substrate that constitutes the active part of coenzyme A molecules (CoA) and acyl carrier proteins (ACP). Pantethine has been tested in humans for its lipid lowering activity and, importantly, no collateral effects were reported. Recent data showed that treatment with pantethine delayed the occurrence of cerebral malaria in a mouse model, with down-regulation of key cellular responses to the inflammatory cerebral syndrome and reduction of blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of pantethine on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model of Multiple Sclerosis (MS).In vivo experiments using C57Bl/6J and SJL mice demonstrated that pantethine prevents the development of chronic and relapsingremitting EAE by delaying the disease onset and reducing the clinical score. Neuropathological studies showed a decrease in inflammatory cell infiltrates and demyelination in mice treated with pantethine. Also, T cells isolated from draining lymph nodes of mice treated with pantethine showed a significant reduction in the antigen-specific proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production when compared to cells from untreated mice. By using IVIS 200 system we found that treatment of mice with pantethine reduced BBB leakage in the spinal cord, the main site of central nervous system inflammation, in the preclincal phase of EAE. Moreover, pre-treatment of T cells with pantethine blocked encephalitogenic T cells, but not na\u00efve lymphocyte, adhesion to purified integrin ligands in vitro. No effect was observed on adhesion molecule expression and integrin distribution in clusters on the cell membrane, suggesting that pantethine may reduce T cell adhesion by inhibiting the signal transduction machinery required for integrin affinity triggering. Finally, intravital microscopy experiments performed in inflamed brain vessels showed that pretreatment of encephalitogenic T cells with pantethine has a significant inhibitory effect on firm adhesion interactions.Our results demonstrate that metabolic intervention with pantethine has immuno-modulatory effects on EAE by reducing T cell activation and adhesiveness and protecting BBB. Since pantethine has low cost and has been successfully administered in humans with absence of side effects, further studies are warranted to obtain indication on the potential clinical usage of pantethine in MS. The presence of oligoclonal bands of IgG (OCB) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is used to establish a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS), but their specificity has remained an enigma since its first description over forty years ago. Hypothesising that OCBs might react with heteromeric lipid complexes we created arrays of 10 myelin lipids and all their 1:1 combinations, comprising 55 antigens. We sought serum and CSF IgG anti-complex antibodies in 40 MS and 40 patients with other neurological disease (OND).",

            "text": "Heatmap analysis identified a lipid specific CSF antibody response in MS patients that preferentially targeted sulfatide (p = 0.004; ANOVA with Bonferroni) and heterodimeric complexes of sulfatide with other lipids. Within individual CSF samples, antibody binding was modulated by specific lipid partnerships. Lipid reactive antibodies were detected in 60% of MS CSF and 25% OND CSF. This MS response was mostly unaccompanied by a serum response indicating that the response was intrathecal and might represent OCB specifities. To explore this, we assessed 100 recombinant antibodies (rAb) derived from clonally expanded CSF B cells/plasmablasts obtained from patients with MS (n = 11; 73 rAb) and other CNS inflammatory diseases (OIND; n = 6; 27 rAb). Lipid specific rAb were generated from 45% of MS patients and accounted for 27% (20/73) of the total rAb, of which 14 bound sulfatide and/or sulfatide containing complexes. The patterns obtained using individual rAb were similar to array patterns probed with CSF from unrelated MS patients, indicating these anti-lipid antibodies represent common, dominant components of this intrathecal response. These specificities were not unique for MS as lipid reactive rAb were also recovered from clonally expanded CSF B cells isolated from OIND patients ( 9/27 rAb; 33%).As sulfatide provides a target for demyelinating antibodies in experimental animals, anti-sulfatide titres have been assumed to be pathogenic. Our preliminary data indicate otherwise, as unlike the demyelinating antibody O4, the sulfatide reactive rAbs fail to bind to the surface of live myelin or oligodendrocytes in vitro; an effect associated with a marked difference in the fine specificity of these antibodies. This suggests that sulfatide-containing complexes recognized by these rAb are not normally accessible within the plane of the living membrane and are unlikely to provide targets for primary antibody-mediated demyelination. Subacute cerebellar ataxia may have an autoimmune aetiology in some patients. Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration can be associated with onconeural and calcium channel (VGCC) antibodies, and some non-paraneoplastic cerebellar syndromes are positive for GAD or Homer-3 antibodies. However, proof of an autoantibody-mediated mechanism is lacking as most of these antibodies react with intracellular antigens and are probably biomarkers of an immune process rather than being pathogenic. However, we hypothesized that some patients would have an immune-mediated syndrome associated with autoantibodies to a cell surface antigen, and we screened a cohort of patients with possible autoimmune cerebellar syndromes for cerebellar neurons surface antigens antibodies.Fifty-six serum samples from four European centers were collected. Indirect immunofluorescence on live cultured rat cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) and live cerebellar organotypic slices were used for primary screening. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry were performed to identify the antigenic target. Cell-based immunofluorescence assays (CBA) were performed with possible candidate antigens.Twelve out of 56 samples exhibited reactivity on live CGNs or organotypic cerebellar slices showing binding to the surface of neurons. A proteomic approach (IP plus Mass Spec) led to the identification of Caspr-",
