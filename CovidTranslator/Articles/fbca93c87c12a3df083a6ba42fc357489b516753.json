            "text": "Rationale: Patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) after infection with severe respiratory viruses (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus, H5N1 avian influenza virus), exhibited unusually high levels of CXCL10, which belongs to the non-ELR (glutamic-leucine-arginine) CXC chemokine superfamily. CXCL10 may not be a bystander to the severe virus infection but may directly contribute to the pathogenesis of neutrophil-mediated, excessive pulmonary inflammation. Objectives: We investigated the contribution of CXCL10 and its receptor CXCR3 axis to the pathogenesis of ARDS with nonviral and viral origins. Methods: We induced nonviral ARDS by acid aspiration and viral ARDS by intratracheal influenza virus infection in wild-type mice and mice deficient in CXCL10, CXCR3, IFNAR1 (IFN-a/b receptor 1), or TIR domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-b (TRIF). Measurements and Main Results: We found that the mice lacking CXCL10 or CXCR3 demonstrated improved severity and survival of nonviral and viral ARDS, whereas mice that lack IFNAR1 did not control the severity of ARDS in vivo. The increased levels of CXCL10 in lungs with ARDS originate to a large extent from infiltrated pulmonary neutrophils, which express a unique CXCR3 receptor via TRIF. CXCL10-CXCR3 acts in an autocrine fashion on the oxidative burst and chemotaxis in the inflamed neutrophils, leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation. Conclusions: CXCL10-CXCR3 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the exacerbation of the pathology of ARDS. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis could represent a prime therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of ARDS of nonviral and viral origins.",

            "text": "as 60% (3) . The natural history of ARDS is marked by exudative (acute), proliferative (subacute), and fibrotic (late) phases. Many patients die in the acute fulminant phase of ARDS, which is characterized by an extremely severe pulmonary inflammatory response accompanied by massive neutrophil accumulation, increased vascular permeability, and high production of cytokines and chemokines (i.e., IL-6, IL-1b, and IL-8)a so-called \"cytokine storm\" (4, 5) . To date, no effective drugs targeting the underlying pathophysiology have been proven to improve clinical outcomes in ARDS (1, 2) . Because of its high lethality and the threats of emerging respiratory virus infections, it is important to identify novel therapeutic targets for ARDS. Patients infected by SARS coronavirus (6) or H5N1 avian influenza (7) who developed ARDS exhibited unusually high levels of C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10), also known as IFN-g-induced protein 10 kD (IP-10), which binds the CXCR3 receptor, inducing chemotaxis, apoptosis, cell growth, and angiostasis (8, 9, 10) . Recent highly pathogenic H5N1 virus isolates appear to be even more potent inducers of CXCL10 compared with their less pathogenic earlier counterparts (11) (12) (13) , suggesting a possible impact of increased CXCL10 levels on disease severity. However, it was previously believed that higher CXCL10 levels were a sequel to virus infections with increased activation of the JAK/STAT pathway (14) , and whether CXCL10 contributed directly to the pathogenesis of severe virus-induced ARDS remained unclear. On the other hand, Mob-1 (the rat homolog of human CXCL10) is increased in nonviral experimental lung injury (e.g., IL-2-induced lung injury in rats) (15, 16) , although the precise mechanisms remained unclear.",

            "text": "In the present study, we hypothesized that CXCL10 and its receptor, CXCR3, can actively participate in the pathogenesis of the fulminant phase of viral-and nonviral-induced ARDS. Our data also show that mice deficient in CXCL10 or its receptor CXCR3 have decreased lung injury severity and increased survival in response to viral (influenza virus infection) and nonviral (acid aspiration) lung injury. Although CXCR3 was previously believed not to be present on neutrophils (17) , we demonstrated the presence of a unique neutrophil population expressing CXCR3 in the inflamed lungs. Mechanistically, CXCL10-CXCR3 acts in an autocrine fashion on the oxidative burst and chemotaxis in inflamed neutrophils, enhancing fulminant inflammation. Moreover, IFN-b 1 was elevated in lungs of viral and nonviral lung injury. To date, it has been controversial as to whether IFN-a/b can contribute to the pathogenesis of severe respiratory virus infection; IFN-a/b receptor 1 (IFNAR1)-deficient mice have accelerated mortality as a result of H5N1 influenza virus (18) but not SARS-coronavirus infection (19) . To examine if IFN-a/b can control the severity of ARDS, we analyzed IFNAR1 knockout (KO) mice using viral and nonviral lung injury models. We found that IFNAR1deficient mice were not protected from severe lung injury. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis may be a prime therapeutic target in the treatment of the acute phase of ARDS of either nonviral or viral origin.",

A model including an airway compartment comprising a frequency-independent airway inertance and a constant-phase tissue compartment comprising coefficients of tissue elastance can be fitted to Zrs, allowing the partitioning of lung function into components representing the mechanical properties of the airways and lung tissue, as described previously (23) . At the end of the experiment, left lungs were assessed for lung wet/dry weight ratios or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent biochemical analysis. Right lungs were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for histological examination. In separate experiments, BAL (1 ml of PBS 3 3) and differential cell counts were performed. For CXCL10 neutralization with anti-CXCL10 antibodies, C57BL/6 mice received either 50 mg intraperitoneally of anti-mouse CXCL10 (R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN) or isotype-matched control antibodies 30 minutes before surgical procedures. After acid instillation, mice were randomized to four groups: (1) control Ab, saline; (2) anti-CXCL10 Ab, saline; (3) control Ab, acid; (4) anti-CXCL10 Ab, acid.

            "text": "To examine the gene expression profile in nonviral lung injury, we performed a microarray analysis using an acid aspirationinduced lung injury model in rats that recapitulates the acute phase of human ARDS (20) . Intratracheal instillation of hydrochloric acid produced an increase in pulmonary elastance that represents changes in pressure achieved per unit changes in volume ( Figure 1a ) and decreased arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa O 2 ) at 3 hours (Figure 1b) . Pa CO 2 and mean arterial blood pressure remained relatively constant (see Figures E1a and E1b in the online supplement). Histological analysis revealed inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar hemorrhage, and hyaline membrane formation in acid-treated lungs at 3 hours (Figure 1c ). The number of neutrophils in lung lavage fluid was markedly elevated in the acid-treated animals at 3 hours (Figure 1d ). Total RNA was extracted from lung tissue in rats treated with acid (acid group) or rats without acid instillation (control group) and hybridized to Affymetrix rat RGUA34 GeneChips. Quantile normalization and differential expression was determined using R (Statistical Package for Microarray Analysis) in the Bioconductor package (21) . A total of 625 genes were significantly changed after acid aspiration for 3 hours. Figure E1c summarizes the genes that were up-regulated more than fivefold by acid aspiration-induced lung injury. CXCL10 was the most strongly up-regulated gene. Other cytokines/chemokines, including IL-6, CXCL1 (KC), and CXCL2 (MIP-2), were also highly up-regulated in acid-treated lungs. Functional enrichment analysis identified cytokinecytokine receptor interaction and cytokine signaling as the top KEGG pathways overrepresented among differentially expressed genes after acid aspiration (Figure 1e) . Next, using a mouse model of acid aspiration-induced lung injury (22) , we confirmed the up-regulation of CXCL10 mRNA (Figure 1f , upper panel) and protein (Figure 1f , lower panel) in lungs by quantitative real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Acid aspiration resulted in rapid impairment of lung function in WT mice (Figures 2a and Figure 3a ) and histological changes with hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration, and hyaline membrane formation (Figure 3b ). In addition, the mRNA for CXCL2 and IFN-b 1 were up-regulated in acid-treated lungs (Figure 1g ). Next, we determined whether these findings were relevant to patients with nonviral ARDS. Compared with control patients with extrapulmonary diseases, all patients with acute-phase ARDS of nonviral origin had high CXCL10 levels in both plasma and BAL fluid irrespective of ARDS etiology (four patients with sepsis, two with BM transplants, three with pneumonia, and one with multiple trauma) (Figure 1h ). These data indicate that CXCL10 is increased in the acute phase of nonviral ARDS. Figure E2a ). mRNA of virus NP protein from lungs increased after infection ( Figure  E2b ). At 1, 2, and 5 days after infection with influenza virus or mock controls, we measured tissue elastance (Figure 2a ) and airway elastance ( Figure E2c ) in mice, which represent the mechanical properties of the lung tissue and airways, respectively (23) . Pulmonary function becomes impaired over time in this viral infection model (Figure 2a and Figure E2c ). Histologically, inflammatory cells were increased on Day 2, and alveolar wall thickening, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, and inflammatory cell infiltration were found on Day 5 after infection in the virusinfected lungs (Figure 2b ). Neutrophil numbers were markedly elevated in the virus-infected lungs on Day 5 (Figure 2c) . Thus, Figure E2d summarizes results showing the genes that were up-regulated more than fivefold after induction of lung injury, and again CXCL10 was the most strongly up-regulated gene. Pathway enrichment analysis identified enrichment for Toll-like receptor signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction KEGG pathways among the genes that were found to be up-regulated in viralinduced lung injury (Figure 2d ). Up-regulation of CXCL10 mRNA in lungs of virus-treated mice was confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (Figure 2e ). Similar to nonviral lung injury, mRNA expressions of CXCL2 and IFN-b 1 were upregulated in virus-treated lungs (Figure 2f ). These data indicate that CXCL10 is increased in the acute phase of viral lung injury/ARDS.",

Acid aspiration resulted in rapid impairment of lung function in WT mice as demonstrated by increased pulmonary tissue elastance (Figure 3a) , edema formation as assessed by wet to dry weight ( Figure E3a) , and histological changes with hemorrhage and inflammatory cell infiltration (Figure 3b ). In comparison, CXCL10 KO mice exhibited better pulmonary function ( Figure 3a ) and less edema formation ( Figure E3a ) with fewer histological changes (Figure 3b ). CXCL10 deficiency also resulted in diminished pulmonary neutrophil sequestration as demonstrated by lower neutrophil counts in BAL fluid (Figure 3c ). MPO is a hemoprotein that is abundantly expressed in neutrophils and secreted during their activation, and thus MPO activity can be used as an indicator for neutrophil activation (24) . Compared with acid-treated WT mice, MPO activity was reduced in lungs of acid-treated CXCL10 KO mice (Figure 3d ). Production of CXCL2, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant ( Figure E3b ) was also reduced in lungs from acid-treated CXCL10 KO mice. Moreover, neutralization of CXCL10 with a specific antibody improved pulmonary function ( Figure E3c ) and decreased pulmonary edema formation ( Figure E3d ) and neutrophil infiltration into the lung ( Figure E3e ). Similar to CXCL10 KO mice, CXCR3 KO mice showed improved lung function (Figure 3e ) and histological changes (Figure 3f ) in the acid-treated lungs. Neutrophil counts in BAL fluid after acid treatment were less in CXCR3 KO mice compared with WT mice (Figure 3g ). Because type I IFNs were also up-regulated in the acid-treated lungs in WT mice (Figure 1h) , we next tested whether type I IFNs were involved in the pathogenesis of acid aspirationinduced lung injury using IFNAR1 KO mice. Changes in lung function after acid aspiration were comparable between IFNAR1 KO mice and WT mice (Figure 3h ). Neutrophil counts in BAL fluid after acid treatment were not different between CXCR3 KO mice and WT mice (Figure 3i) . These data suggest that type I IFNs are unlikely involved in the pathology of acid aspiration-induced lung injury in mice.",

Moreover, CXCL10 mRNA expression was significantly elevated in neutrophils isolated from lungs of mice treated with acid for 3 hours (Figure 5b , left panel) or infected with influenza viruses for 5 days (Figure 5b , right panel) as a previous study had shown CXCL10 expression from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (25) . Macrophages isolated from acid-or virus-treated lungs also expressed CXCL10, but at a lower rate (Figure 5b) . These data suggest that CXCL10 was largely produced in fulminant phase of neutrophils but not by naive neutrophils in both nonviral and viral lung injury. Remarkably, other non-ELR motif CXC chemokines CXCL9 and IFN-b were largely produced in macrophages rather than neutrophils in injured lungs (Figure 5c ). In contrast, CXCL2 was largely produced by neutrophils in injured lungs ( Figure  5c ), as previously reported (5) .",

However, recent studies have shown the expression of CXCR3 on neutrophils from patients with chronic lung disease but not in healthy control subjects (26) . Thus, we next tested whether CXCR3 was present on inflamed neutrophils in lungs with fulminant injury. CXCR3 mRNA was significantly up-regulated in neutrophils in lungs obtained from mice treated with acid for 3 hours (Figure 5d, upper panel) or influenza virus infection for 5 days (Figure 5d, lower panel) , whereas it was almost absent in naive neutrophils in lungs obtained from control mice (Figure 5d) . Also, CXCR3 protein was mapped to Ly6G-positive neutrophils in BAL cells obtained from influenza virus-infected mice (Figure 5e, lower panel) , but not BM-derived naive neutrophils (Figure 5e, upper panel) . Moreover, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that CXCR3 expression was higher in BAL neutrophils obtained from influenza virus infected-mice than BM-derived naive neutrophils (Figure 5f ).",

Furthermore, CXCR3 expression by flow cytometric analysis was less in BAL neutrophils obtained from virus-infected TRIF KO mice than the virus-infected WT mice (Figure 5h) . These data suggest that the infiltrated neutrophils in lungs with ARDS, but not noninfiltrated naive neutrophils, express CXCR3 via the TRIF pathway. Our data indicate an induction of CXCL10 originating from neutrophils, and a unique neutrophil population expressing CXCR3, in fulminant lung injury, prompting us to examine a possible autocrine loop of CXCL10 and CXCR3 on neutrophils as described below.",

            "text": "We previously demonstrated that activation of the TLR4-TRIF pathway by damage-associated molecular patterns (33) derived from dying cells is a common signaling pathway responsible for the pathogenesis of lethal lung injury caused by multiple nonviral (i.e., acid aspiration) and viral (i.e., SARS, H5N1 influenza, anthrax) stimuli (22) . Interestingly, CXCL10 is a key chemokine downstream of the TLR4-TRIF pathway and is also produced in lungs stimulated with either TLR2-or TLR4receptor ligands (34) . Here we demonstrate that CXCL10 is critically involved in the pathogenesis of the acute phase of nonviral and viral lung injury/ARDS. Also, we show a neutrophil population expressing CXCR3 receptors via TRIF in inflamed lungs and that loss of CXCR3 is associated with improved survival in response to influenza virus infection in mice. In accordance with these findings, a CXCR3 antagonist resulted in a mild reduction of disease symptoms in H5N1-infected ferrets (12) , and CXCR3-deficiency protected influenza-infected CCR5-deficient mice from mortality (35) .",

Some patients with ARDS who survive the exudative phase enter a fibrotic phase that may require long-term ventilator support and/or supplementary oxygen. The alveolar edema and inflammatory exudates of earlier phases are converted to extensive alveolar duct and interstitial fibrosis. CXCL10 (32) and CXCR3 (31) have been shown to attenuate bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice by interruption of angiogenesis (32) and fibroproliferation (31) . The data presented here and in similar studies imply that the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis may have a dual role in the acute (exudative) and chronic (fibrotic) lung processes.",

For example, treatments for H5N1 or pandemic H1N1 infection are restricted to vaccination or early treatment with antiviral agents such as oseltamivir. Although antiviral drugs may be of benefit if administered early in the disease, neither approach is very effective in rescuing patients who have already developed ARDS. Our data indicate that not only is CXCL10 production a bystander chemokine in severe respiratory failure but also CXCL10-CXCR3 can promote development of ARDS, whether the inciting factor is of viral or nonviral origin. Thus, the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis represents an interesting therapeutic target for treatment of patients during the acute phase of ARDS.",
