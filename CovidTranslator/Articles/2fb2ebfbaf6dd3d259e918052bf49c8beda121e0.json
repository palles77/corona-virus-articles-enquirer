Node discovery for the spread of an infectious disease is defined as discriminating between the nodes which are neighboring to a missing disease spreader node, and the rest, given a dataset on the number of cases. The spread is described by stochastic differential equations. A perturbation theory quantifies the impact of the missing spreader on the moments of the number of cases. Statistical discriminators examine the mid-body or tail-ends of the probability density function, and search for the disturbance from the missing spreader. They are tested with computationally synthesized datasets, and applied to the SARS outbreak and flu pandemic.",

The missing spreader may be the place where the first patient appears (an index node) or not (an intermediate node). Its presence impedes the reproduction of the observed spread by an unperturbed mathematical model. The irreproducibility is rather the clue to solve the problem. Two statistical discriminators are invented. Their role is discriminating between the nodes which are neighboring to the missing spreader node, and the rest (non-neighboring nodes), given a dataset. It is a collection of the time sequence data on the number of cases, or on the cumulative number of new cases, at the nodes within the scope of surveillance in the early growth phase of the spread. The network topology and transmission parameters may be given as an input to the discriminators. Or they may be unknown and must be estimated. The discriminators examine the mid-body or the tail-ends of the probability density function of the number of cases, and search for disturbed time sequence data to which the perturbation gives rise. The mid-body discriminator is founded on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The tail-end discriminator is founded on the Chauvenet rejection test. The discriminators are tested with a number of computationally synthesized datasets, and applied to the WHO datasets on the SARS outbreak and on the flu pandemic (H1N1 swine influenza A) in 2009.",

The above discussion implies that the normality of the probability density function for neighboring nodes is vulnerable to the perturbation which a missing spreader node exerts, but that the impact on the normality for non-neighboring nodes is not salient. This is the basis to discriminate between the neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes statistically. Let us extend the theory to multiple non-neighboring nodes. The entire set of non-neighboring nodes is treated as a big node n a . The number of infectious persons at the individual nodes is roughly the same as I n . Assume there are k such nodes. I a \u2248 kI n holds. If n s is an index node, I s \u226b I n holds. The variance of z n in Eq. (9) is sufficiently large as a signal when k < \u03b3 \u2032 I s /\u03b3 I n . Any k satisfies this criterion unless \u03b3 \u2032 is extremely small. If n s is an intermediate node, I s \u2248 I n holds. The variance is large enough when k < (2\u03b3 \u2032 \u2212 \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)/\u03b3 . A small k, rather than a small N, seems a prerequisite for discrimination. When a household or a hospital ward form a sub-population, the population of a node is very small. Most of the subpopulation are likely to get infected immediately at the onset of infection. The day-by-day fluctuating growth of the number of patients, in which the trace of perturbation is left, will not be observed. The formulae in this study may not work under this condition. Moreover as an extreme, a social network model, where an individual is a node, is suitable to analyze the transmission of such diseases as Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) [25] . Formulating a stochastic model and perturbation theory for the social network model is beyond the scope of this study.",

In the simple network in 3.2, this results in m i (t d+1 |\u03b8, 0) \u223c m i (t d+1 |\u03b8, \u03b3 \u2032 ) and v ij (t d+1 |\u03b8, 0) \u223c v ij (t d+1 |\u03b8, \u03b3 \u2032 ), consequently \u27e8z n \u27e9 \u223c 0 and \u27e8(z n \u2212\u27e8z n \u27e9) 2 \u27e9 \u223c 1, rather than Eqs. (8) and (9). This is confirmed by measuring the moments with the datasets. The measured moments are shown in Appendix C. When a missing spreader node is absent, the moments for given \u03b8 are almost the same as those for the estimator\u03b8. And the moments are \u27e8m i \u27e9 \u2248 0 and \u27e8v ii \u27e9 = 1. The estimator reproduces the spread accurately. On the other hand, the difference in every moment between neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes for the estimator\u03b8 is much smaller than that for a given \u03b8 when the missing spreader node is an index node. The difference in \u27e8m i \u27e9, and that in \u27e8v ii \u27e9 are so small that n n can not be distinguished from n a by examining the lower order moments. This is the reason why the mid-body discriminator is not suitable if \u03b8 is unknown. Furthermore, the difference in every moment between neighboring nodes and non-neighboring nodes is particularly small when the missing spreader node is an intermediate node. Discovery of a missing intermediate node is a hard problem. Fig. 2a, b shows the curves when the number of data is D = 33. Accuracy is the same as that in Fig. 1a ,b. It does not depend on these experimental conditions. Fig. 2c , d shows the curves when the reproductive ratio is r = 8, which is four times larger than the value in Fig. 1a, b . The best performance of the tail-end discriminator is R TP \u2212 R FP \u2248 0.95 for a given \u03b8, and \u2248 0.85 for an unknown \u03b8.

On the other hand, when \u03b8 is unknown, the estimator\u03b8 may be able to make up for the distortion in the higher order moments. The tail-end discriminator with the estimator\u03b8 outperforms the discriminators for a given \u03b8. Even if the true parameters are given, adjusting the parameters is rather indispensable for excellent discrimination from \u2206J i (t d ). Substantial improvement of Eq. (7) is beyond the scope of this study and is for a future challenge. Fig. 4a , b shows R TP \u2212 R FP as a function of the discrimination threshold L * or T * when \u03b8 is given. The rising edges of the three curves coincide with each other. L * = \u22123 to \u22123.5, and T * = 1.5 to 2 are reasonable if there is no prior information on the presence or absence of a missing spreader node. If the assumption is grounded well that an index node is missing, there is a distinct optimal threshold L * = \u22124, and T * = 2.1. Fig. 4c , d shows R TP \u2212 R FP when \u03b8 is unknown.

Fig. 5c , d shows the optimal thresholds L * and T * as a function of the number of nodes N. The optimal thresholds depend on r. This means that it is practical to find the optimal threshold experimentally, which is suitable for individual conditions.

The annual number of passengers from Mexico to the United States by land is 24 times larger than that by air in 2009. The number from Canada to the United States by land is 7 times larger than that by air in 2005. The meta-population network model relies on Eq. (14) which is known to be valid for the world-wide air transportation. The actual heavy land transportation lets the probability of movement across the border deviate from the value estimated in the model. This is supported by the result that the fraction\u03b3 is twice as large as that for the SARS outbreak. The deviation imposes an impact on the speed of the spread at such cities near the border as San Ysidro CA, then inland cities, and finally such cities near another border as Buffalo-Niagara Falls NY [32] . The discovered signal of perturbation for the United States, Mexico, and Canada could originate in a localized exception to the empirical law for the probability of movement, rather than a missing spreader node.",

The ratio is significantly higher than 1.4 to 1.6 from an epidemiological analysis, or 1.2 from a genetic analysis, in Mexico and other countries [34] . School closure started on May 17 just after the secondary transmission had been confirmed and announced officially. The effective reproductive ratio declined below 1. The reproductive ratio in Japan rose and fell sharply in 10 days in early May. The precondition of the SIR compartment model is that the values of the transmission parameters do not depend on time and sub-populations.

On the other hand, the signal discovered by the discriminators satisfies the sufficient condition to ascertain the presence of a missing spreader node incompletely, although it satisfies the necessary conditions. Prior knowledge on the demographic and socioeconomic nature of individual regions makes up for the incompleteness. This is similar to the false positives where the signal identified an early warning for a catastrophe originates in wide classes of impending transitions because the underlying mechanism is understood incompletely [35] . It is also of interest to see if the discovered location of a missing node satisfies the criterion for a strongly influential spreader in the core of the network [36] . Is it possible to distinguish the presence of a missing spreader node from an anomaly on the parameters mathematically? The solution will be worked out by examining how possible origins of perturbation appear in respective order moments of the disturbed time sequence data, and by finding a suitable backward mapping from the pattern of disturbance to the possible origins. The criterion for discrimination may be a complex function of the preconditions of a mathematical model, experimental conditions, and given datasets, rather than a simple scalar threshold of a test statistic in this study. These issues are for future challenges.",

The performance depends neither on the speed of the spread, on the size of the network, nor on the number of data much. If the cumulative number of new cases is given as a dataset, discrimination is moderately excellent, and interestingly, the tail-end discriminator works more excellently when the parameters are unknown than when they are given.

The data for Hong Kong is disturbed extremely strongly.

In the flu pandemic, the signal of perturbation is discovered in the time sequence data for the United States, Mexico, Canada, and Japan. The ratio of the number of these regions is much smaller than that for the SARS outbreak. The test statistics are much less anomalous than those for the SARS outbreak.
