There is limited information about the mechanisms through which progressive mobility exercises contribute to mitigation or prevention of ICU-acquired weakness (Griffiths and Hall, 2010) . Circulating biomarkers related to both inflammation and ICUacquired weakness include interleukin (IL)-6, a proinflammatory cytokine that influences muscle health, and IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine that down-regulates the inflammatory cascade (Truong et al., 2009; Winkelman, 2007) . Linking mechanisms of inflammation to a therapeutic \"dose of mobility exercise\" can support clinical decisions about starting and progressing mobility exercise.",

Patients were asked to separately rate fatigue and pain after an exercise session using a scale of 0 (no fatigue or pain) to 10 (worst possible fatigue or pain). Muscle strength was measured manually at discharge from the ICU, using the Medical Research Council Scale (0-5, with 5 being maximal strength) on four muscle groups: shoulder adduction, elbow extension, hip flexion, knee extension with a maximum score of 40 combining right and left extremity values . At the time of discharge from the ICU, function was measured using the Katz Activities of Daily Living scale (Katz et al., 1970) with either patient or proxy interview. At ICU discharge, delirium was measured using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU (CAM-ICU) (Ely et al., 2001) . Diagnosis of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) was determined by research staff using established criteria (Johanson et al., 1972) , including bronchial lavage results when documented (Mayhall, 2001) . Occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) was extracted from daily progress notes and reports of related diagnostic tests (e.g., duplex sonography of lower extremities, computerised tomography of the chest and ventilationperfusion scan). Outcomes of duration of mechanical ventilation, length of ICU stay and discharge location (including mortality) were abstracted from records within 24 hours of ICU discharge.

During the run-in phase, five new subjects were enrolled, the intervention was refined for feasibility within the specific environment, and RAs were trained in the refined protocol. During the intervention period, a consistent research protocol was implemented for 55 new subjects and outcomes were measured. Identification and recruitment of patients were the same during each period. On the first day of eligibility, the patient was evaluated for physiologic stability before beginning the consent process. Physiologic stability was defined using the following parameters: P/F ratio > 100, FiO 2 < 60% and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) < 10 cm H 2 O, heart rate 50-125, mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60-100 mm Hg (SpO 2 > 88%, and no active upward titration of vasoactive (e.g. dopamine, dobutamine, neosynepherine, epinephrine) or sedative (e.g., midazolam, propofol)) intravenous drugs in the previous four hours. If a patient was unstable on the first eligible day of enrolment, we followed his/her status daily until stability was achieved. When instability persisted beyond 14 days, we did not pursue consent, reasoning that \"early\" progressive mobility was not feasible. Following consent, demographic and resting data were collected. Patients were monitored for a 30-60 minute period of rest, and then either monitored during a period of exercise planned by the bedside nurse (control) or engaged in 20 minutes exercise by a RA using a protocol developed by Peter Morris (personal communication January, 2007 ; subsequently published; see Morris et al., 2008) . Participants were followed until discharge from the ICU. While resting data could be collected pre-or post-exercise, it would always occur after a period of observed rest. As cytokines and vital signs (VS) typically return to baseline well within the minimal observed time of 30 minutes at rest Vollman, 2012) , one would not expect differing results from resting values as long as the values reflect a period of no exercise or other inflammatory intervention.",

Both inflammation and immobility have been identified as independent contributors to muscle weakness (Chambers et al., 2009; Truong et al., 2009 ).

Improved progression to out-of-bed activity has been reported when a dedicated staff initiates exercise in intubated adults (Kasotakis et al., 2011; Morris and Herridge, 2007; Needham and Korupolu, 2010; Pohlman et al., 2010) . The protocol used herein was clinically useful as evidenced by a number of results from the intervention group: reduced number of missed opportunities for exercise; increased duration of exercise; and more episodes of out-of-bed exercise. The first exercise session occurred on day 6 for the intervention group versus day 9 for the control group, despite greater admission acuity among intervention participants (see Table 2 ). Other reports of progressive mobility for intubated adults reported first out of bed activity on days 7-10 after ICU admission (Bailey et al., 2007; Pohlman et al., 2010; Thomsen et al., 2008) .",

While not all patients were able to be tested for delirium due to inability to assess (i.e., a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale [RASS] score of \u22123 or \u22124), the finding of low incidence of delirium indirectly suggests that mobility exercises or the combination of exercise and limited sedation may contribute to reduced delirium. Alternatively, any exercise (standard or protocolised) provides an opportunity for patients to have verbal interaction with a staff member, and it may be that the psychosocial aspects of mobility (e.g., following directions or hearing conversational cues about sensation and movement) are beneficial to preserving cognitive function during prolonged critical illness and recovery.",

Progression of exercise requires that critically ill patients are alert and able to engage in activities (Kasotakis et al., 2011) . Our protocol provided a focused exam to determine patient readiness and the mode of exercise (in-bed or out-of-bed); physiological parameters were monitored to maintain a relatively stable status.

Turning and mobility are reported as one of the most commonly missed nursing interventions (Kalisch, 2006; Winkelman et al., 2005) . Teamwork can reduce missed nursing care (Kalisch and Lee, 2010) . Several mobility protocols recommend a 3-5 member team to implement exercise, including a registered nurse (RN), a respiratory therapist, a physical therapist, an occupational therapist and aide or nonprofessional assistant (Morris et al., 2008; Needham and Korupolu, 2010; Perme and Chandrashekar, 2009; Schweickert et al., 2009) . In this current nurse-initiated protocol, all \"teams\" were ad hoc, with membership including the RN research assistant and available unit personnel, typically a RN and nursing assistant. It may be that the use of a RA (i.e., ICU RNs not employed in the setting) to initiate progressive mobility had unintended consequences, such as allowing patients or staff to decline participation. Several other studies report the value of a physical therapist to initiate and progress exercise. One setting uses a mobility team dedicated to assessing and implementing exercise. Nonetheless, in this protocol, both amount and duration of mobility exercise increased, despite limited resources.",
