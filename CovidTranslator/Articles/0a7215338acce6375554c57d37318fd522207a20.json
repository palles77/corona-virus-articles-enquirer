On the other hand, emerging data suggest that antibiotic exposure can affect other adverse transplant outcomes [5] [6] [7] . Although the exact mechanism remains elusive, the immunomodulatory effects of antibiotics via altered gut microbiota on the susceptibility to bacterial infection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) may be a plausible explanation [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] .",

Consecutive subjects were identified from 2 cohorts. The first cohort included patients who underwent transplantation from March 2010 to February 2016, and had nasal samples collected and tested for clinical purposes when respiratory symptoms were present. The second cohort was a subset of a prospective surveillance study of HCT recipients undergoing transplantation from June 2008 to February 2010 in which standardized respiratory symptom surveys and multiplex respiratory PCR tests were performed weekly during the first 100 days post-transplant [27] . For this analysis, we included subjects with respiratory symptoms at the time of first detection of respiratory viruses and those with complete blood cell counts measured within 2 weeks before the virus detection. Demographic and clinical data were extracted from the Fred Hutch's database and medical chart review. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Fred Hutch.",

After comparing the cumulative incidence curves by baseline antibiotic exposures for each of the previously mentioned time windows, we selected 1 window to estimate the association between antibiotic exposure and progression to LRTD in unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models. Proven/probable LRTD and proven/probable/possible LRTD were analyzed as separate outcomes, in separate models. Baseline covariates for potential confounders were selected from previously identified risk factors for disease progression, important biological variables, and factors thought to influence antibiotic use, such as neutropenia during the window in which antibiotic exposure was measured [23, 24, 30, [33] [34] [35] . These covariates were then tested for associations with LRTD using univariable Cox models. Novel GVHD prophylactic strategies including T cell depletion, alemtuzumab, and abatacept were not our standard practice and not analyzed in this study. Due to the limited number of events, multivariable models were considered only for the combined proven/ probable/possible LRTD outcome and included a maximum of 4 variables. Each antibiotic exposure (overall, individual antibiotics, specific groups of antibiotics) was analyzed in separate models, using the same approach as outlined subsequently. To guide selection of confounders of the association between antibiotic exposure and progression to LRTD, we proposed 2 directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). We used the set of minimal sufficient adjustment variables identified by each DAG to select covariates for inclusion in multivariable models [36, 37] . Due to the high correlation between lymphopenia and monocytopenia at viral onset, we included these variables in separate multivariable models. Because our selected time window had the same number of days for all patients, estimates for average number of antibiotics per day were reported as hazard ratios (HRs) for a 7-unit increase in the number of antibiotic-days, for easier interpretation. The proportional hazards assumption was assessed by graphical checks based on martingale residuals and by testing for an interaction between the logarithm of analysis time and each covariate. To address any concerns of antibiotic use for rapidly progressing respiratory illness immediately before our defined date of viral onset, we performed sensitivity analyses in which we shifted time windows to end 3 days before viral onset rather than 1 day before onset. Two-sided P values <.05 were considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).",

In addition to antibiotic exposure, leukopenia (lymphopenia, monocytopenia, and neutropenia) at or in the 3 weeks before viral onset was associated with increased risk of disease progression. In contrast, no factors measured pretransplantation (eg, age, conditioning regimen, leukopenia) were found to be significant.

Because this led to more than the maximum number of variables we could include given our limited number of events, we evaluated bivariable models including HCT comorbidity index and each antibiotic exposure variable. The antibiotic estimates did not change substantially (data not shown), indicating the HCT comorbidity index did not have a substantial confounding effect on the association between antibiotic exposure and progression to LRTD.

            "text": "Recent randomized controlled trials indicate that even short-term antibiotic use may lead to significant changes in the gut microbiota [38, 39] . Antibiotic exposure and low microbiome diversity have been increasingly recognized as important risk factors for poor transplant outcomes including GVHD and bacterial infection [3, 6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] 40] . The potential adverse impact of antibiotic exposure on transplant outcomes is further highlighted by a recent randomized trial in which azithromycin prophylaxis given for 2 years post-transplantation resulted in worse airflow decline-free survival and higher rates of hematologic relapse when compared with placebo [7] . Altered microbiota induced by antibiotic use may play a role in immune modification and transplant outcomes [6, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Interestingly, rates of disease progression to LRTD vary widely from 5% to 55% for PIV, RSV, and MPV, depending on surveillance measures and transplant centers [23, 24, 41] . These findings raise the question of whether different antibiotic practices between transplant centers may be an important reason for the observed differences in progression rates. The epidemiological link observed in the current study may provide rationale to further probe the impact of microbiota on transplant outcomes including respiratory viral disease progression. This premise is consistent with recently published data showing that the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria is negatively correlated with respiratory viral disease progression [42] . When transplant outcomes are evaluated in future studies of antimicrobial de-escalation strategies, different antibiotic utilization strategies or other strategies modifying the microbiome, respiratory disease progression could be assessed as an important endpoint.",

Our proven/probable/possible LRTD proven/probable LRTD Figure 2 . Univariable model estimates for associations with progression to proven/probable/possible lower respiratory tract disease. Filled squares represent HRs and bars represent 95% confidence intervals (lower confidence limit [LCL] and upper confidence limit [UCL]). Estimates shown in black represent the unadjusted estimates for associations with progression to proven/probable LRTD (12 proven/probable LRTD events). Estimates shown in gray represent the unadjusted estimates for associations with progression to proven/probable/possible LRTD (33 proven/probable/possible LRTD events). Antibiotic exposures in the 3 weeks prior to 1 day before viral onset were used. No patients received clindamycin in this time window. The HR for number of antibiotic-days represents the effect per 7-day increase; all other estimates represent any versus no use of the specified antibiotics. Antibiotics with anaerobic activity include meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, and clindamycin. The HR for age at transplantation represents the effect per 10 years of age older. Estimates for conditioning regimen compare nonmyeloablative to myeloablative regimens and those for HCT comorbidity index compare values of 3 to 0 to 2. Preconditioning lymphocyte or neutrophil counts are the minimum value from 21 to 8 days before transplantation and HRs represent the effect per 100-unit increase. Estimates for time from transplantation compare 30 days to > 30 days to RVI onset. Lymphopenia or monocytopenia at RVI onset was defined as nearest count within 2 weeks before viral onset being <100/mm 3 . Neutropenia was defined as <500/mm 3 ; HRs for frequency of neutropenia represent the effect per 10% increase in the percentage of days with neutropenia. Figure 3 . Directed acyclic graphs describing 2 hypothetical models for the relationship between our main exposure, antibiotic use in the 3 weeks prior to 1 day before viral onset, and our outcome, proven/probable/possible lower respiratory tract disease. Green variables represent ancestors of the exposure, blue variables represent ancestors of the outcome, and red variables represent ancestors of both exposure and outcome. Gray variables indicate unmeasured variables for this study. Green arrow shows the causal path that needs to be estimated while red arrows show biasing paths that need to be blocked to estimate the causal association. (A) Under this framework, minimal sufficient sets of adjustment variables required to estimate this association without bias include either (1) lymphopenia at viral onset or results may imply that recent antibiotic exposure is more likely to impact respiratory disease progression than distant antibiotic exposure. In fact, mice showed diminished immune responses against influenza virus when inoculated immediately after the course of antibiotics [14, 16] . It is important to note that the magnitude of our reported association between overall antibiotic exposure and LRTD (adjusted HR of 1.5) represents the increased risk associated with a 7-day increase, to match a short course of antibiotics. Longer or concurrent antibiotic courses would be associated with higher risks. For example, the estimated HR for each unit increase in the average number of antibiotics per day would be nearly 2.8. We chose to examine associations of some antibiotic classes based on spectrum of antimicrobial activity because this might provide deeper insight into mechanisms of action. For example, antibiotics with activity against Clostridiales (gram-positive anaerobic bacteria) are associated with increased risk of GVHD or transplant-related mortality; the use of Clostridiales-sparing antibiotics has been proposed [5, 8] . The current study did not demonstrate a statistically significant association between use of specific antibiotic classes and progression to proven/probable/possible LRTD in adjusted models, although a trend was observed between the use of certain antibiotic groups (eg, antibiotics with significant anaerobic activity or carbapenems) and an increased risk of progression.",

Despite our attempt to combine proven/probable LRTD and possible LRTD to perform adjusted model analysis, it is possible that the study was underpowered to adequately evaluate the impact of any specific antibiotic class. Although possible LRTD has been used as \"LRTD\" in numerous studies [26, [43] [44] [45] [46] , it would be ideal to apply more strict criteria to increase the certainty of microbiological diagnosis for LRTD [30] . In our study, the HRs for proven/probable LRTD alone were higher in the groups with exposure to some antibiotics (eg, vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin) than those for proven/probable/ possible LRTD. If similar adjusted models for the outcome of proven/probable LRTD alone were performed among a larger cohort of patients or events, we might see larger effects of these antibiotics. Furthermore, we were unable to examine doseresponse relationships with some specific antibiotic classes and to determine whether our observations differ between individual viruses. Finally, despite our efforts to adjust for confounders using DAGs, it is possible that other factors or different causal diagrams may explain the relationship between antibiotic exposure and LRTD; unrecognized confounders cannot be completely eliminated due to the nature of the retrospective study. This is the first study to demonstrate that cumulative antibiotic exposure immediately prior to viral onset appears to be an important risk factor for the disease progression for some respiratory viruses in transplant recipients. Larger cohort studies are needed to determine whether exposure to specific antibiotic classes increases the risk of disease progression and whether there are differences between respiratory viruses. Ultimately, randomized clinical trials of different antibiotic utilization strategies or other strategies modifying the microbiome are needed.",

Model estimates for unadjusted and adjusted associations of antibiotic exposures in the 3 weeks prior to 1 day before viral onset with progression to proven/probable/possible lower respiratory tract disease.

Estimates shown in black represent the unadjusted estimates, those in dark gray represent adjusted estimates from multivariable model 1 (adjusting for percentage of days with neutropenia in the 3 weeks before viral onset, lymphopenia at viral onset, and steroid use in the 2 weeks before viral onset), and those in light gray adjusted estimates from multivariable model 2 (adjusting for percentage of days with neutropenia in the 3 weeks before viral onset, monocytopenia at viral onset, and steroid use in the 2 weeks before viral onset). The HR for number of antibiotic-days represents the effect per 7-day increase; all other estimates represent any versus no use of the specified antibiotics. Antibiotics with anaerobic activity include meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, ampicillin/sulbactam, amoxicillin/clavulanate, metronidazole, moxifloxacin, and clindamycin.",
