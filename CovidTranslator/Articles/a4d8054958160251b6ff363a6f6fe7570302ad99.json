Norkurarinol, a lavandulylated flavanone, was isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity. Norkurarinol suppressed the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 inducible secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity induced by poly(I:C), TLR3 ligand, in THP1-Blue-CD14 cells with IC50 values of 20.9 \u03bcM. Norkurarinol also significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of proinflammatory and adhesive molecules induced by poly(I:C) and rotavirus infection. Pretreatment of norkurarinol blocked the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 signaling pathway and the phosphorylation of MAPKs induced by poly(I:C). On the other hand, norkurarinol increased the level of IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN\u03b2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, norkurarinol inhibited the rotavirus-induced cytopathic effects. These results suggest that norkurarinol can modulate the TLR3-mediated inflammatory responses and rotavirus replication.",

Ten human TLRs have been characterized thus far (1) . They are expressed mainly by cells involved in immune functions such as monocytes and macrophages (1, 2) . Generally, TLRs can activate two branches of the downstream signaling pathways: myeloid differentiation factor (MyD)88-dependent and MyD88independent pathways (3). MyD88 is a common downstream adaptor molecule for all mammalian TLRs with the exception of TLR3. TLR3 and TLR4 activate the MyD88-independent signaling pathway mediated through the TIR domain containing adaptor inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF)-dependent pathway (4 -7) . All TLRs and ligands engagements finally result in the production of downstream inflammatory cytokines and leukocyte adhesion molecules by the activation of nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) / activator protein-1 (AP-1)-dependent transcriptional pathways (8, 9) . In particular, TLR3 is the receptor for viral dsRNA and the dsRNA mimic poly(I:C) (10) . Most viruses synthesize dsRNA at some point during their replication cycle. Therefore, TLR3 is an important detector of viral infections and an initiator of the immune response.",

On the other hand, the excessive innate immune activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines can be harmful, leading to microcirculatory dysfunction, tissue damage, shock, or even death of the host (11 -14) . Therefore, the excessive inflammatory response induced by the TLRs signaling pathways needs to be under tight control. If small mole-cule inhibitors can be found to modulate the TLRs-specific responses, it may assist in the development of therapeutic compounds to block excessive inflammation. Indeed, many studies demonstrated that certain phytochemicals including flavonoids and polyphenols possessing anti-inflammatory effects inhibit NF-\u03baB activation induced by a range of TLR agonists (15) . Recently, the anti-inflammatory compounds auranofin and curcumin were reported to block TLR4/MyD88 interaction (7, 16) .",

Therefore, to determine if norkurarinol can modulate TLR3 activation, the SEAP reporter system employing poly(I:C), a TLR3 agonist, was used as a readout for the activation of TLR3.

The THP-1 cells were stimulated with poly(I:C) in the presence or absence of norkurarinol. Treatment with poly(I:C) alone for 6 h led to an increase in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 mRNA expression (31-fold and 33-fold, respectively), and these expressions were markedly inhibited by the pretreatment of norkurarinol (30 \u03bcM) for 1 h before the treatment with poly(I:C) (Fig. 3a) . Poly(I:C)induced mRNA expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and MCP-1 was also dramatically suppressed by the pretreatment with norkurarinol (30 \u03bcM) (Fig. 3: b and c) . On the other hand, a treatment with norkurarinol (30 \u03bcM) alone did not lead to an increase in the expression of these inflammatory molecules. Because TLR3 uses a MyD88independent signaling pathway in contrast to the other TLRs, we next examined whether the effect of norkurarinol is applicable to TLR2 signaling that is mediated by MyD88. Treatment of THP-1 with Pam3CSK4, a TLR2 agonist, induced mRNA expression of TNF-\u03b1 and ICAM-1, while norkurarinol did not inhibit these mRNA inductions suggesting that this compound specifically inhibits TLR3 signaling, but not TLR2 (Fig. 3d) .",

Treatment of THP-1 cells with poly(I:C) for 2 h induced NF-\u03baB p65 and c-fos, AP-1 subunit, translocation into the nucleus, whereas norkurarinol inhibited poly(I:C)-induced nuclear translocation of these factors in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5a) . The effect of norkurarinol on the phosphorylation of I\u03baB, an upstream molecule of NF-\u03baB, was also examined. Treatment with poly(I:C) alone for 1 h induced the phosphorylation of I\u03baB, whereas norkurarinol inhibited the poly(I:C)-induced phosphorylation of I\u03baB in a dose-de-pendent manner (Fig. 5b) . IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2 are upstream kinases of I\u03baB in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and phosphorylate I\u03baB, followed by NF-\u03baB activation (21) . IKK\u03b3 is an important regulatory component of a high- molecular-weight complex (the IKK complex) that also contains two catalytic proteins known as IKK\u03b1 and IKK\u03b2. Although the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b3 at Ser376 has been shown to down-regulate the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, some groups reported that IKK\u03b3 is needed in the activation of NF-\u03baB by a number of stimuli such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, HTLV1 Tax protein, LPS, and PMA (21) . Treatment with poly(I:C) alone for 1 h induced the phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and IKK\u03b3, whereas norkurarinol inhibited the poly(I:C)-induced phosphorylation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 and IKK\u03b3 (Fig. 5c) . Furthermore, norkurarinol modulated the phosphorylation of MAPKs. Treatment with poly(I:C) alone for 1 h induced the phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK1/2, whereas norkurarinol inhibited poly (I:C)-induced phosphorylation of p38, JNK, and ERK1/2 (Fig. 5d ). In addition, effects of norkurarinol on the IRF3 pathway were investigated. Surprisingly, norkurarinol induced an increase in IRF3 phosphorylation rather than inhibiting IRF3 phosphorylation induced by poly(I:C) (Fig. 5e) .",

Immunoblotting with anti-p-IRF3 and \u03b2-actin antibodies was performed on total protein (10 \u03bcg protein/lane). b -d) Total RNA was isolated and cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR analysis were performed. Cells were incubated with norkurarinol for 6 h at the indicated concentrations (b). THP-1 cells were incubated with poly(I:C) (50 \u03bcg/mL) in the presence or absence of norkurarinol for 2 h at the indicated concentrations (c). TF-104 cells were infected with 0.01 MOI rotaviruses for 1 h, and the cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of 60 \u03bcM norkurarinol for 24 h (d). Data are represented as the relative expression of IFN\u03b2 mRNA normalized to GAPDH. All experiments were repeated more than 3 times. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, NS = Not significant. the direct target of norkurarinol on the TLR3 signaling pathway, norkurarinol blocked the inflammatory response induced by poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of dsRNA, as well as the rotavirus-induced CPE. TLRs play a key role in regulating the activation of the innate immune response to microbial genomes such as viral dsRNA, ssRNA, viral DNA, and bacterial DNA (1, 2). Ten human TLRs have been characterized thus far. They are expressed predominantly by cells involved in immune functions such as monocytes and macrophages (1, 2) . In particular, TLR3 is an intracellular TLR localized in endosomes and it binds to the dsRNA of viral origin (30 -32) . On the other hand, Sophora flavescens has been identified as having anti-inflammatory activities (17, 19, 21) and it has previously reported that polyphenols, pterocarpans, and flavanones from Sophora flavescens have glycosidase and neuraminidase inhibitory activities (18, 20) . Recently, one article reported that matrine isolated from Sophora flavescens has protective effects against tissue damage caused by inflammation from NO-dependent vasomotion and has inhibitory effects on inflammatory cytokines induced by LPS (33) . We showed here that norkurarinol isolated from Sophora flavescens might be a good material for specifically suppressing TLR3 signaling. Ligand interaction with TLR3 recruits the adaptor protein TRIF, which in turn activates NF-\u03baB, MAPK/AP-1, or IRF3 pathway. Norkurarinol effectively inhibited NF-\u03baB/AP-1-inducible SEAP activity induced by poly(I:C). This compound also completely inhibited the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and leukocyte adhesion molecules induced by poly(I:C) and rotavirus infection.",

In this study, we found that norkurarinol effectively inhibited the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, MCP-1, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 induced by the TLR3 agonist, while it did not affect the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and ICAM-1 induced by the TLR2 agonist (Fig. 3) .

Our results suggesting that norkurarinol might specifically inhibit TLR3 signaling through the suppression of the TRIF-dependent pathway. We found here that norkurarinol also substantially inhibited the expression of IL-6, MCP-1, and VCAM-1 induced by LPS, a TLR4 agonist (data not shown). Because TLR4 uses both MyD88-dependent and MyD88-independent (TRIF-dependent) pathways, norkurarinol might affect the TLR4 pathway through the suppression of TRIF.

The purified genomic dsRNA from the rotavirus is recognizable by TLR3 (10, 26) , suggesting that the genomic dsRNA and TLR3 signaling might be involved in viral pathogenesis. In addition, NF-\u03baB activation supported rotavirus replication by inhibiting premature apoptosis in the early stages of infection (35) . Therefore, the inhibition of TLR3 signaling and the subsequent decrease in the proinflammatory responses can be a potential method of treating a dsRNA virus infection. The present study showed that norkurarinol blocked the NF-\u03baB and AP-1 signaling pathway as well as the phosphorylation of MAPKs induced by poly(I:C). On the other hand, norkurarinol failed to inhibit IRF3 phosphorylation induced by poly(I:C). Rather than blocking IRF3 phosphorylation, norkurarinol enhanced IRF3 phosphorylation and IFN\u03b2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. It was reported that some cell types including hepatocytes contained two distinct antiviral signaling pathways leading to expression of type I IFNs, one dependent upon TLR3 and the other dependent on the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), with little cross-talk between these pathways (36) . Activation of the RIG-I pathway by the intracellular presentation of dsRNA or another viral PAMP produced by replicating viruses may contribute to the initial induction of type I IFNs. Norkurarinol induced IFN\u03b2 expression while suppressing the TLR3/TRIF-dependent pathway, suggesting that norkurarinol might induce IFN\u03b2 expression through a TRIF-independent pathway such as the RIF-1 pathway. However, further studies are need to explicitly determine the mechanisms by which norkurarinol induces IRF3/IFN\u03b2 expression. IFN\u03b2 has been reported to have the ability to diminish the production of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 as well as inhibit virus replications (37, 38) . The use of IFN\u03b2 as immunotherapy has increased in recent years with an expanding list of potential applications.",

In addition, norkurarinol was found to have novel actions such as being a potent inducer of IRF3/IFN\u03b2 expression and a modulator of rotavirus replication. ",
