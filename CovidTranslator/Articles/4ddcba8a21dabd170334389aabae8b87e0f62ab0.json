The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike (S) protein is an important target in developing safe and effective SARS vaccines. Our previous study has demonstrated that vaccination with adenoassociated virus encoding RBD (RBD-rAAV) induces high titer of neutralizing antibodies. In this study, we further assessed the immune responses and protective effect of the immunization with RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-specific T cell peptide boost. Compared with the RBD-rAAV prime/boost vaccination, RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-peptide (RBD-Pep) boost induced similar levels of Th1 and neutralizing antibody responses that protected the vaccinated mice from subsequent SARS-CoV challenge, but stronger Th2 and CTL responses. No significant immune responses and protective effects were detected in mice vaccinated with RBD-Pep or blank AAV alone. Since T cell epitopes are highly conserved and boosting with peptides may induce the production of effector memory T cells, which may be effective against viruses with mutations in the neutralizing epitopes, our results suggest that the vaccination protocol used may be ideal for providing effective, broad and long-term protection against SARS-CoV infection.",

It is also indicated that the S, among all structural proteins of SARS-CoV, is the only significant neutralization and protective antigen, and that a single mucosal immunization with S protein efficiently suppresses SARS-CoV infection [6] . Furthermore, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fragment of S protein, has been demonstrated to be a major neutralization determinant in the development of subunit vaccines against SARS [7, 8] .

In this regard, fragments of SARS-CoV S protein are more practical and safer for developing vaccines. It has been shown that the S1 domain, especially the RBD region, is the main fragment and major determinant in eliciting NA against SARS-CoV [7, 8] . In previous studies, we have also demonstrated that candidate vaccines based on the RBD induced high titers of neutralizing antibody and prevented subsequent SARS-CoV challenge in vaccinated mice [11, 15] .

DNA vaccines boosted with inactivated virus or viral protein fragments have been shown to improve immune responses, including neutralizing antibody response, against SARS-CoV [9, 25, 26] . It was also reported that the immunization by priming with a DNA plasmid encoding SARS-CoV N protein (pcDNA3.1-N) and boosting with an adenoviral vector expressing the same protein (rAd-N) effectively elicited strong SARS-CoV-N-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in vaccinated mice [27] . In this study, we further demonstrated that the immune responses could be enhanced by priming with RBD-rAAV and boosting with RBD-pep corresponding to the T cell epitopes in the RBD region of SARS-CoV S protein. Compared with the RBD-rAAV prime/boost vaccination, RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost induced similar levels of Th1 and neutralizing antibody responses but stronger Th2 and CTL responses (Figs. [2] [3] [4] [5] . Like the RBD-rAAV prime/boost vaccination, the RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-pep boost vaccination could also induce potent protective activity in mice against SARS-CoV challenge (Fig. 6) . However, no significant immune responses and protective effect were detected in mice vaccinated with RBD-pep or blank AAV alone. These results indicated that RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-Pep boost vaccination can greatly promote cellular immune responses and neutralizing antibody production in the vaccinated mice, which may play important roles in the suppression of SARS-CoV infection in the challenged mice.",

We have compared amino acid sequences of N50 and N60 peptides, which were used for boost vaccination, between 25 human SARS-CoV strains and 5 civet cat SARS-CoV strains deposited in Genebank. N50 is completely conserved in these strains, and only one strain (Sino1-11) shows a single amino acid change in N60. Thus, the strategy of boosting with T cell peptide may plausibly provide cross-protection against quickly mutated viruses. In this study, both RBD-rAAV prime/RBD-pep boost and RBD-rAAV prime/boost vaccinations provided similar protection against subsequent SARS-CoV challenge, which may be attributed to the neutralizing antibody responses against the challenged virus induced by both strategies. However, the former may probably induce more effective protection against infection by viruses with mutations in the neutralizing epitopes than the latter because the former can elicit significantly stronger specific CTL response than the latter.",
