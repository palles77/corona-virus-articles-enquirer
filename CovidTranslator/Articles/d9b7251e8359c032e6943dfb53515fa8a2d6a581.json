The specificity of these two types of sulfation as TGN modifications has been exploited to selectively label marker molecules for both the constitutive and regulated pathway of secretion as they pass through the TGN, and to detect their exit from the TGN . Cells of the neuroendocrine line PC 12 contain two major tyrosinesulfated proteins, chromogranin B (secretogranin I) and secretogranin II (Sgll) that have been shown to be efficiently targeted to secretory granules (Lee and Huttner, 1983; Rosa et al., 1985; Rosa et al. } 1989; Gerdes et al, 1989) . These characteristics make chromogranin B and Sgll ideal markers for the regulated secretory pathway. PC 12 cells also synthesize one major heparan sulfate proteoglycan (hsPg) (Schubert et al., 1988; Gowda et al., 1989) , that can be used as a marker for the constitutive pathway of secretion: it is excluded from secretory granules and its secretion is blocked at 20\u00b0C . The latter property has been shown to be a hallmark for proteins traveling by the constitutive pathway (Matlin and Simons, 1983) . Furthermore, sulfate labeling of secretogranins and the hsPg can be used to selectively monitor their post-TGN transport via the regulated and constitutive pathway, respectively. For this purpose, however, it is essential to separate ISGs and CSVs from the TGN and from each other, for instance, by physical separation of these cellular compartments. An outline for a method to achieve this follows.",

With the use of velocity-controlled sucrose gradient centrifugation, organelles in the postnuclear supernatant (PNS) prepared from the [ 35 S]sulfate-labeled cells are then fractionated to separate the TGN from post-TGN secretory vesicles, and the distribution of the sulfate-labeled marker proteins across the gradient is analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in conjunction with fluorography.",

After a 15-min chase, however, most of the labeled Sgll and hsPg is found in the top half of the gradient. Apparently, the labeled proteins leave the TGN during this period and are then present in vesicles which, due to their smaller size, sediment more slowly than the TGN.

Because ISGs (characterized by dense cores) have a significantly greater density than CSVs, this procedure yields two distinct peaks of labeled proteins: one higher in the gradient, containing the sulfate-labeled hsPg in CSVs, and one lower in the gradient, containing the sulfate-labeled Sgll in ISGs .",

This system is based on the ability to monitor bio-chemically the transport and sorting of Sgll and hsPg from the TGN to ISGs and CSVs, respectively. Protein sorting to the regulated and constitutive secretory pathways is reconstituted in vitro when a PNS, derived from PC 12 cells pulse-labeled with [ 35 S]sulfate, is prepared in an iso-osmotic, low-ionic strength, sucrose-containing buffer at neutral pH and then supplemented with ATP and an ATP-regenerating system . The two types of post-TGN vesicles formed in the cell-free system were found to have similar properties to CSVs and ISGs formed in vivo. Unlike most existing cell-free transport assays (for review, see Goda and Pfeffer, 1989) , this system measures only the formation of vesicles and not the transfer of a defined marker protein from a donor to an acceptor compartment, which is a multistep process involving both vesicle formation and vesicle fusion.",

In the case of the small ras-like GTP-binding proteins of the mammalian rab family, which have been implicated in vesicle fusion, it has been postulated that they form part of a proofreading machinery that ensures the correct targeting of vesicles to the appropriate acceptor membrane (for reviews, see Bourne, 1988; Balch, 1990; Goud and McCaffrey, 1991; Pfeffer, 1992) .

Another nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP, GMP-PMP, also inhibited the formation of post-Golgi vesicles, albeit much less effectively than GTP7S on a molar basis. This is in agreement with previous findings on the relative effects of GMP-PNP and GTP7S on cell-free intra-Golgi vesicle traffic (Melan\u00e7on et al., 1987) . The inhibition of post-TGN vesicle formation by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogs was largely prevented by the addition of excess GTP and was specific with respect to the guanine moiety, as a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog, ATP7S did not affect the formation of either class of post-TGN vesicles .",

            "text": "To test this putative role of trimeric G proteins, the effect of purified G protein \u00df7 subunits on cell-free vesicle formation has been investigated (Barr et al., 1991) . The rationale for these experiments was based on the observations that \u00df7 subunits exert the opposite effect to nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues on the activation state of G protein a subunits (for reviews, see Gilman, 1987; Taylor, 1990; Birnbaumer et al., 1990) . This is presumably the result of a shift in the association equilibrium between the a and \u00df7 subunits toward the trimeric, inactive form. Indeed, it was found that \u00df7 subunits stimulated the exit of the constitutive and regulated secretory marker proteins from the TGN in a manner that was directly proportional to the amount of subunits added (Barr et al., 1991) . Interestingly, the fold stimulation of exit from the TGN was greater for the hsPg, the constitutive secretory marker (4fold at 400 nM \u00df7), than for Sgll, the regulated secretory marker (2.5-fold at 400 nM \u00df7). In addition, it was found that the sorting of Sgll into ISGs is perturbed by \u00df7 subunits (400 nM), resulting in the packaging of approximately 40% of Sgll into vesicles with a buoyant density characteristic of CSVs. The packaging of hsPg into CSVs was not altered under these conditions. These findings may reflect differences in the mechanisms by which these two classes of vesicles form, or in the way in which their formation is regulated by trimeric G proteins.",

Cholera toxin is known to specifically ribosylate the a subunit of G s (Cassel and Pfeuffer, 1978) , while pertussis toxin acts on the a subunit of G i and G 0 (for review, see Kaziro et al., 1991) . Accordingly, these toxins were employed to identify the G protein(s) regulating post-TGN vesicle formation. The approach used was to carry out toxin-dependent ADP ribosylation in a PC12-derived PNS under the conditions of cell-free vesicle formation, and then to analyse the distribution of ADP-ribosylated proteins using velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation (Barr et al., 1991 ) . In the presence of pertussis toxin, an approximately 40 kDa protein was ADP-ribosylated, which on velocity sucrose gradient centrifugation was detected in two peaks; one in the top three fractions of the gradient, which are known to contain various subcellular organelles including post-TGN vesicles and plasma membrane (R\u00e9gnier-Vigouroux et al, 1991) , and the other in the lower part of the gradient known to contain TGN membranes . The latter material was found to colocalize with the TGN on subsequent equilibrium sucrose gradient centrifugation. No ADP-ribosylated a subunit comigrating with the TGN was observed when cholera toxin was used (Barr et al., 1991) . The conclusion drawn from these data was that a Gctj or Ga 0 , or both, is present on TGN membranes of PC 12 cells. In line with previous reports by other investigators (Ercolani et al., 1990; Stow et al., 1991) , the pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein on PC 12 cell TGN membranes is likely to be G i3 .",

Overexpression of this a subunit was found to inhibit the constitutive secretion of an hsPg in LLC-PK1 cells (Stow et al., 1991) .

Moreover, small ras-like GTP-binding proteins of the mammalian ADP ribosylation factor (ARF) family have been found to be among the components of the nonclathrin coat of intra-Golgi transport vesicles, referred to as coat proteins (Serafini et al., 1991) . Although no direct link between nonclathrin coat assembly and vesicle formation has yet to be reported, the interaction of two coat proteins, ARF and \u00df-COP (Duden et al., 1991) , with Golgi membranes is affected under conditions known to inhibit vesicle formation, such as the presence of GTP7S (Donaldson et al, 1991a,b; Serafini et al., 1991) . This points toward an involvement of ARF in vesicle formation, a suggestion consistent with the observation that a yeast mutant for ARF is defective in invertase secretion (Steams et al., 1990) . Since the yeast GTP-binding protein Sari is homologous to mammalian ARF (Nakano and Muramatsu, 1989) , it is tempting to speculate that in general, small ras-like GTP-binding proteins of the ARF/Sari family are involved in vesicle formation by regulating coat assembly at the level of the donor membrane, and that this regulation is mediated via GTP binding and hydrolysis.",

The shibire mutant was originally identified as a mutant with alterations in the structure of the neuromuscular junction leading to paralysis (Poodry and Edgar, 1979) . In this mutant the primary defect is at the level of endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits, which are unable to bud from the plasma membrane (Kosaka and Ikeda, 1983) . The shibire gene has recently been cloned and sequenced (van der Bliek and Meyerowitz, 1991) . The corre-sponding protein was found to be a homologue of rat dynamin (Chen et al., 1991) , a 100 kDa microtubule-binding protein with GTPase activity able to induce microtubule mobility in vitro (Shpetner and Vall\u00e9e, 1989) . Together, these findings raise the possibility that GTP-binding motor proteins such as dynamin may be involved in the scission of endocytotic vesicles from the plasma membrane.",

Dynamin as well as the shibire gene product show homology to the yeast Vpsl protein, which is involved in protein sorting from the TGN to the vacuole and is a putative GTPase (Rothman et al., 1990) . Clathrin is thought to be involved not only in endocytosis, but also in the formation of vesicles from the TGN, which deliver lysosomal enzymes bound to mannose-6-phosphate receptors to endosomes (Kornfeld, 1987) . In addition, patches of clathrin have been found on ISGs (Tooze and Tooze, 1986) , and a species of clathrin light chain (LC b ) is enriched in cells and tissues with the regulated secretory pathway (Acton and Brodsky, 1990) . If there indeed exists a clathrin-dependent mechanism for vesicle formation from the TGN, it is conceivable that this mechanism would employ a motor protein like dynamin, and therefore, GTP hydrolysis in the final scission event. By analogy, one may speculate on the existence of a similar GTP-binding protein as part of the \"scission machinery\" that operates in the nonclathrin-dependent mechanism of vesicle formation.",

            "text": "An inhibitory mechanism for the exit of constitutive and regulated secretory proteins from the TGN might be related to the obvious requirement for a regulatory system that prevents vesicles forming from the TGN unless appropriate cargo is available. Such a system might regulate the rate of vesicle formation to ensure, for example, (1) that secretory proteins destined to undergo post-translational modifications [e.g., sialylation (Roth et al., 1985) and tyrosine sulfation (Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987) ] only leave the TGN after having acquired these modifications, which can be crucial for the fate of a protein (e.g., Ley te et al., 1991) ; or (2) that regulated secretory proteins only leave the TGN after having been segregated via aggregation (Chanat and Huttner, 1991) from constitutive secretory proteins. The lack of completion of these process might somehow be monitored by a transmembrane receptor, for instance by recognition of unmodified sites for posttranslational modification or of nonaggregated regulated secretory proteins. Such a putative transmembrane receptor might then interact with a trimeric G protein, stimulating GDP-GTP exchange on the G protein a subunit and hence promoting its activation. The activated a subunit in turn presumably interacts with an effector on the cytoplasmic side of the TGN membrane (see Fig. 1 ). Until the activated a subunit hydrolyzes its bound GTP to GDP, this effector will either reduce vesicle formation below the normal rate, or be prevented from maintaining vesicle formation at the normal rate. In this regard, it is interesting to Fig. 1 . Schematic representation of a signal transduction machinery in the membrane of the trans-Golgi network involved in the regulation of vesicle formation.

As mentioned before, small GTP-binding proteins have been shown to be part of the nonclathrin coat of intra-Golgi transport vesicles (Serafini et al., 1991) . This may also be true for post-TGN secretory vesicles. Although the nature of the coats of CSVs and ISGs is not precisely known (Tooze, 1991) , the transient presence of these coats implies that their assembly and disassembly before and after scission, respectively, are somehow regulated. Both assembly and disassembly may involve the same small GTP-binding protein that could promote either coating or uncoating, depending on its GTP/GDP-bound state. Free coat subunits of the small GTP-binding protein family may only associate with the membrane when they are in the GTP-bound form. GTP hydrolysis might be linked to a proofreading step related to either coat polymerization or the proper assembly of the various components of the vesicle membrane. Such a \"conditional\" GTP-hydrolysis could, for instance, ensure the production of vesicles that contain all transmembrane and peripheral molecules required to define its intracellular destination.",
