            "text": "Paulownia species, especially their flowers and fruits, are traditionally used in Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of infectious diseases. Cgeranylated flavonoids were found to be the major special metabolites in Paulownia flowers and fruits, and 76 C-geranylated flavonoids had been isolated and characterized thus far. Structural variations in Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids are mainly due to the complicated structural modifications in their geranyl substituents. These natural compounds have attracted much attention because of their various biological activities, including antioxidation, antiinflammation, cytotoxic activity and various enzymatic inhibitions, etc. Among them, diplacone, a major Paulownia component, was considered to have promise for applications in medicine. This paper summarizes the information from current publications on Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids, with a focus on their structural variety, key spectroscopic characteristics, biological activity with structureactivity relationships and application prospects. We hope that this paper will stimulate further investigations of Paulownia species and this kind of natural product.",

            "text": "C-geranylated flavonoids, a small group of flavonoid derivatives consisting of a flavonoid skeleton joined with a terpenoid side-chain (C 10 , geranyl substituent) via a direct carbon-carbon bond directly, are considered as the members of the prenylated flavonoids (Barron and Ibrahim 1996) . Among these compounds, the geranyl has been revealed to have the potential to occur as a substituent possibly at the C-3, C-6, C-8, C-2\u2032 or C-3\u2032 positions of the flavonoid skeleton ( Fig. 1) . C-geranylated flavonoids, as secondary metabolic products, are biosynthesized via the mevalonate pathway (for the geranyl skeleton) and the shikimic acid pathway with cinnamoyl CoA (for the flavonoid skeleton), and the connection is provided by the prenyltransferases, the key biosynthetic enzymes for prenylated polyphenols in plants (\u0160 mejkal 2014; Andersen and Markham 2006; Kuzuyama et al. 2005) . Recently, an aromatic prenyltransferase was discovered in Aspergillus terreus and exhibited unprecedented promiscuity towards flavonoid acceptors to produce C-geranylated flavonoids (Chen et al. 2017a) . C-geranylated flavonoids occur in relatively few plant families, such as Leguminosae, Moraceae, Rutaceae, and Ophioglossaceae (Yazaki et al. 2009 ). Among them, the Paulownia genus (Paulowniaceae family) is a rich natural source of this kind of compound.",

Now, only nine species are accepted as part of the Paulownia genus by Flora of China as shown in Table 1 (Chinese Flora Editorial Committee 1998). Paulownia species are fast-growing shade trees native to China and Southeast Asia and are mainly grown as ornamental trees or commercially for the production of hardwood timber (Zhu et al. 1986; Bergmann 1998) . Moreover, their leaves, flowers, fruits and root barks are also traditionally used as Chinese herbal folk medicines for the treatment of enteritis, tonsillitis, bronchitis, dysentery, etc. (He et al. 2016) . Phytochemical research has indicated that Paulownia plants contain quinones, lignans, triterpenes, phenylpropanoid glycosides, and flavonoids (Xing et al. 2013; He et al. 2016) . However, Cgeranylated flavonoids, as the main constituents, have attracted much attention due to their structural variation and assorted biological properties.",

It could be hydroxylated at C-7\u2033 to produce a common 7-hydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-2(E)-octenyl substituent (20-27) or a rare (2E,5E)-7-hydroxy-3,7-dimethylocta-2,5-dien-1-yl substituent (40); at C-6\u2033 to achieve a 6-hydroxy-3,7-dimethyl-2(E)-7-octadienylsubstituent (28-37), which could be further oxidized to yield an unusual 3,7-dimethyl-6-oxoocta-2,7-dien-1-yl substituent (41); or at C-2\u2033 to obtain a rare 2-hydroxy-7-methyl-3-methyleneoct-6-en-1-yl substituent (38 and 39). The oxidation could also occur at C-7\u2033 and C-8\u2033 simultaneously to form 6,7dihydroxy-3,7-dimethyloct-2-en-1-yl (42 and 43) or 6-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3,7-dimethyloct-2-en-1-yl (44-46) substituents. Interestingly, on the foundation of hydroxylation, further cyclic modifications could occur in the geranyl substituent to yield more attractive Paulownia C-geranylflavonoids (Fig. 4) . The pyran or furan moiety could be generated in Paulownia C-geranylflavonoids by a further cyclization between the geranyl substituent and C-7 in ring A via an oxygen atom or between two carbon atoms in the geranyl via an oxygen atom. Compounds 47-56, containing a 2,3,7,8-tetrahydropyrano moiety, and compounds 57-62, containing a 2,3-dihydropyrano moiety with a double bond assigned to C-1\u2033 and C-2\u2033, were provided by cyclization between C-3\u2033 of the geranyl substituent and C-7 in ring A of the flavanone skeleton via an oxygen atom. Meanwhile, some other carbon atoms in these modified geranyl substituents, such as C-2\u2033 (56), C-6\u2033 (61) or C-7\u2033 (62), could be further hydroxylated to yield more complex geranylated flavonoid derivatives. Similarly, cyclization occurring between C-2\u2033 of the geranyl substituent and C-7 in ring A of the flavanone skeleton via an oxygen atom could produce a 2H-furo unit (63 and 64), but this structural modification was not universal in natural C-geranylated flavonoid derivatives. Cyclization could also occur between two carbon atoms in the geranyl chain via an oxygen atom to Fig. 3 Noncyclic modified C-geranylflavanones isolated from the Paulownia genus yield furan (between C-3\u2033 and C-6\u2033, 65) or pyran (between C-3\u2033 and C-7\u2033, 66) moieties in Paulownia C-geranylflavonoids. Compound 67 was, to date, a unique C-geranylflavanone with a monocyclic monoterpene side-chain isolated from Paulownia plants up to mow (Wang et al. 2019) , and its oxygenated cyclogeranyl substituent was similar to that (without the hydroxyl) in some ugonins isolated from Helminthostachys zeylanica (Huang et al. 2003; .",

When orally administered at a bolus dose of 25 mg/kg, they all exhibited greater effects than the positive control of sulfasalazine, reducing the level of COX-2 and increasing the ratio of pro-MMP2/MMP2 by prophylactic/therapeutic administration (Vochy\u00e1nov\u00e1 et al. 2015) . Moreover, different pro-inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines produced by various inflammatory cell models were detected in vitro to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects of Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids (Table 4 ). Diplacone (2) significantly downregulated the expression of tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and upregulated the expression of zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) at 10 \u00b5M, with effects even better than those of the positive control of indomethacin (Ho\u0161ek et al. 2010) , which also inhibited I\u03baB-\u03b1 degradation and COX-2 expression at 1.25 \u00b5M in the murine macrophage cell line J774.A1 (Ho\u0161ek et al. 2013 ). Compounds 2, 5, 11, 14, 15 , and 17 exhibited significant inhibition of LPS-induced NO production in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells with IC 50 values from 1.48 to 16.66 \u00b5M, compared with IC 50 16.60 \u00b5M of aminoguanidine as the positive control . In addition, the effects of 21 Paulownia Cgeranylated flavonoids on the secretion of the typical pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 in LPS-stimulated THP-1 cell from were evaluated. Compounds 2, 4, 8, 38 and 56 could affect the secretion of TNF-\u03b1 at 2.0 \u03bcM more than prednisone as the positive control, and mimulone H (38) and tomentodiplacone N (56) significantly increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the THP-1 cells without LPS stimulation (Han\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. 2015) . In another biological activity assay on human alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549 cells), compounds 23, 26, 35, 52-54 significantly inhibited TNF-\u03b1-induced IL-8 levels at a concentration of 2.5 \u03bcM without detectable cell toxicity ).

Regarding cellular biological activities (anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects), antibacterial and antiparasitic activities, and enzymatic inhibitions, an ortho-dihydroxy arrangement at C-3\u2032,4\u2032 of the B-ring was considered an essential group but also enhanced the cytotoxic risk. Hydroxylation at C-3 in ring C and 4\u2032-methoxy substitution of ring B might cause a loss of bioactive potency (\u0160mejkal et al. 2008a; Wang et al. 2019 ). In addition, the unmodified geranyl group at the C-6 position seemed to be crucial for these various biological effects in vitro and in vivo (Vochy\u00e1nov\u00e1 et al. 2015) of C-geranylated flavonoids, however, hydroxylation on the distal end of the geranyl substituent decreased the biological activities revealed by different research (Alcar\u00e1z et al. 2000; \u0160 mejkal et al. 2010; Han\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. 2017; Ryu et al. 2017) . The presence of a \u03b2-carbon (proximal) OH group on the geranyl chain did not affect the cytotoxicity (Han\u00e1kov\u00e1 et al. 2015) .

Recently, a series of biological activities such as those mentioned above were evaluated for this compound. The results indicated that it possessed excellent antioxidant and antiinflammatory effects, and it was considered as a potential antioxidant therapy agent for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (Moura et al. 2015) and as a potential novel 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor for the treatment of asthma (Bruno et al. 2018) . At present, diplacone and its isomers have been protected by patent application as a pharmaceutical composition for treating an ocular disease (Liao 2016) . Diplacone may be used as a lead compound for new drug design.",

To date, 76 naturally occurring Paulownia C-geranylated flavonoids have been reported in the phytochemical literature. Among them, C-geranylflavanones were predominant constituents with a single geranyl substituent mainly attached to the C-6 position of the flavonoid skeleton. Furthermore, the geranyl substituent could suffer different modifications, such as oxidation (hydroxylation and carbonylation), dehydration, cyclization, or special reduction, to result in the structural variety and novelty of Paulownia C-geranylflavonoids. As a natural resource, fruits of P. tomentosa were explored more abundantly and P. catalpifolia gave rise to some unusual C-geranylflavonoids. Unfortunately, other Paulownia species were with poor attention by researchers and need further phytochemical and pharmacological investigations.",
