While the effect of hand washing on individual transmissibility of a disease has been studied through medical and public-health research, its potential as a mitigation strategy against a global pandemic has not been fully explored yet. In this study, we investigate contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and analyze the impact of hand-hygiene behavioural changes of airport population against the spread of infectious diseases worldwide. Using a granular dataset of the world air transportation traffic, we build a detailed individual mobility model that controls for the correlated and recurrent nature of human travel and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at different locations. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation study to assess the impact of different hand-washing mitigation strategies at the early stages of a global epidemic. From the simulation results we find that increasing the hand cleanliness homogeneously at all airports in the world can inhibit the impact of a potential pandemic by 24 to 69%. By quantifying and ranking the contribution of the different airports to the mitigation of an epidemic outbreak, we identify ten key airports at the core of a cost-optimal deployment of the hand-washing strategy: increasing the engagement rate at those locations alone could potentially reduce a world pandemic by 8 to 37%. This research provides evidence of the effectiveness of hand hygiene in airports on the global spread of infectious diseases, and has important implications for the way public-health policymakers may design new effective strategies to enhance hand hygiene in airports through behavioral changes.",

The pathogens are transmitted through the air 8 , resulting in the contagion of airborne diseases, or through physical contact between individuals. The transmission is accelerated when a dense population of people is concentrated in a confined area 9 like an airport, with lack of good hygiene and efficient air ventilation. After an outbreak, infections diffuse while infected individuals transmit the disease to susceptible individuals. Airports play a major role in such contagious dynamics 10 , as they contribute daily to the contact of people from all over the world, some of whom may be carrying endemic infections and bacteria from their country of origin. In addition, there are numerous highly contaminated surfaces which are frequently touched by the passengers at airports and inside aircrafts 11 . Self-service check-in screens, gate bench armrests, water fountain buttons and door handles at airports, as well as seats, tray tables and handles of lavatories in aircrafts, are all known to have high microbial contamination 12-14 .",

At the individual level there is a focus on behavioral change towards adopting different interventions in the case of a health emergency 15, 16 . Along with other developments in medicine, vaccination has made a big contribution in that direction leading to the extinction of past epidemics and a significant reduction of mortality due to specific infections 17 . Vaccination has a substantial mitigating effect when effective vaccines are available soon enough after the emergence of a new disease and when vaccination campaigns cover about 70% of a susceptible population 18 . However, despite the known impact of vaccines on the reduction of infections, the rate of vaccination in the population has remained unchanged over the past decade 19 . Social nudges such as peer effects or education on vaccination benefits, and changes in the design of vaccination campaigns, can be deployed to change human behavior towards the increase of influenza vaccination rates 20 . In addition of preventing disease spreading by vaccination, isolating patients at home or closure of high-risk places like schools can moderate the transmission of disease-causing pathogenic microorganisms.",

At the global scale, mobility-driven interventions such as airport closures and deliberate rerouting of the travelers, can reduce the number of individuals passing through or traveling from/to regions where dangerous diseases prevail 22 . At the local scale, actions at individual airports such as frequent cleaning of public areas (e.g. toilets, gates, check-in desks, etc.), efficient air ventilation and enhanced sensitization of frequently touched surfaces can reduce the risk of contamination and the transmission of infections. Furthermore, personal hygiene is the most important factor to prevent the spread of an infection 23 . Coughing etiquette, face masks, no face touch and hand hygiene are the most common actions that air travelers can easily adopt. From those actions, hand washing is the simplest and most effective component for preventing the transmission of viruses 24-27 and bacteria, and is regularly mentioned as the first recommendation of precautions in health care (see for example 28 ). A scientific study on the effects of hand washing on the bacterial contamination of hands, showed that after a deliberate contamination of individuals by touching door handles and railings in public places, bacteria were found in 44% of the sample, while this percentage was reduced to 23% after hand washing with water only, and to 8% after hand washing with water and plain soap 29 . The same study concluded also that the effect of hand washing does not depend on the bacteria species.",

In this work, we study contagion dynamics through the world air transportation network and we elucidate the impact of hand-hygiene behavioral changes on the diffusion of infections worldwide. We develop a computational model to track the realistic mobility patterns of air travelers, their hand washing behavior and the dynamics of epidemic spreading. Human mobility is modelled by a stochastic agent-base system that accounts for the spatial distribution of airports, the realistic human mobility through the world air transportation network, and the waiting-time distributions of individuals at origin, destination and connecting airports. In addition, we develop a compartmental epidemic model which relates the disease spreading with hand-hygiene behaviour. Using Monte-Carlo simulations we assess the impact of hand washing at the early stages of a global epidemic spreading. From the simulation results, we measure the early-time spreading power of the 40 busiest airports under four different intervention scenarios: 1. increase of hand washing engagement homogeneously at all airports; 2. increase of hand washing engagement only at the source of the disease; 3. increase of hand washing engagement at the ten most important airports of the world air transportation network; and 4. increase of hand washing engagement at the ten most important airports for each source of the disease. The aim of this study is to identify the most effective mitigation strategy of hand hygiene contributing the most to the reduction of global epidemic spreading.",

            "text": "In past centuries, contagious diseases would migrate slowly and rarely across continents. Black death, for example, which was the second recorded pandemic in history after the Justinian Plague, originated in China in 1334 1 and it took almost 15 years to propagate from East Asia to Western Europe. While contagious diseases were then affecting more individuals within countries due to poor hygiene and underdeveloped medicine, the means of transportation of that era -sea and land -hindered the range and celerity of disease spreading. Nowadays in contrast, transportation means allow people to travel more often (either for business or for leisure) and to longer distances. In particular, the aviation industry has experienced a fast and continuing growth, permitting an expanding flow of air travelers. In 2017 alone, around 4.1 billion people traveled through airports worldwide 2 while the International Air Transport Association (IATA) expects that the number of passengers will roughly double to 7.8 billion by 2036 3 . Transportation hubs such as airports are therefore playing a key role in the spread of transmittable diseases 4 . In severe cases, such disease-spreading episodes can cause global pandemics and international health and socio-economic crises. Recent examples of outbreaks show how quickly contagious diseases spread around the world through the air transportation network. Examples include the epidemic of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and the widespread H1N1 influenza. SARS initial outbreak occurred in February 2003, when a guest at a hotel in Hong Kong transmitted an infection to 16 other guests in a single day. The infected guests then transmitted the disease in Hong Kong, Toronto, Singapore and Vietnam during the next few days, and within weeks the disease became an epidemic affecting over 8,000 people in 26 countries across 5 airport to a destination airport, and indicates any intermediate connecting flights (see Table 1 International Airport, Beijing, China) to HND (Haneda Airport, Tokyo, Japan), X2 individuals traveled from PEK to HND with a layover at PVG (Shanghai Pudong International Airport, Shanghai, China), and X3 individuals traveled from ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, Atlanta, USA) to ABV (Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport, Abuja, Nigeria) with connecting flights at JFK (John F. Kennedy International Airport, New York, USA) and CDG (Charles de Gaulle Airport, Paris, France) airports.",

Each element of the O O OD D D p p p matrix is calculated by od p i j = od f i j / \u2211 j od f i j where \u2211 j od f i j is the total number of passengers that traveled from origin i. We then assign a 'home' population P i at each subpopulation i following the nonlinear empirical relation P i = \u03b1 \u221a T i , where T i is the total traffic at airport i and \u03b1 is a constant parameter that is identified to give a total population size of N = \u2211 i P i individuals. In other words, each individual agent is initially assigned to its 'home' subpopulation i. Within the mobility route, the agent that was assigned to home i chooses to travel at a 'destination' airport j with probability extracted from the O O OD D D p p p matrix. If the two nodes i and j are connected by more than one path (i.e. direct when the two airports are connected with direct flights and indirect when the two airports are connected only with connecting flights), then the probability that the agent selects a given path is proportional to the relative number of passengers traveling in each direct or indirect flight from origin i to destination j. After each trip (from origin i to destination j), the agent returns back to its home airport. Thus, the stochastic mobility model generates the spatial trajectory for all agents. In addition, using realistic waiting times at the three distinct locations where an agent can be (i.e. home, connecting airport or destination) and actual flight times required to travel between the airports we express the spatio-temporal patterns of all the agents at the granularity of an hour. The waiting times at home airports, connecting airports and destinations are provided by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics 2010 34 , and follow right-skewed distributions with means 897.87 hours (\u223c37 days), 1.33 hours, and 127.36 hours (\u223c5 days) respectively. The average flight times between each airports i and j, are estimated as the ratio of the geographical distance of the two airports, d i j , calculated by the spherical law of cosines, over the average velocity of an airplane which is assumed to be constant and equal to 640 km/h considering the changes in takeoff, climb, cruise, descent and landing speeds.",

However, if he/she washes hands soon after he/she gets contaminated there is big probability of taking that bacteria out of hands before they are transmitted to body fluids. Therefore, the hand washing rate of healthy individuals affects the transmissibility of a disease as well. Our SIR WD model takes into account only the interdependence between disease transmission probability and the hand cleanliness of the infected individuals. To model the process where the hand washing behavior of susceptible/healthy individuals has a role in the infection process, we need to build a more sophisticated model based on SEIR reaction kinetics, where the extra epidemic compartment E indicates individuals that are Exposed to bacteria or viruses 36 . The SEIR epidemic model describes the following three processes: (a) a susceptible comes in contact with an infected individual and becomes exposed to the disease with some rate \u03b2 (S + I \u03b2 \u2212 \u2192 E + I), (b) an exposed becomes infected with some rate \u03b3 (E \u03b3 \u2212 \u2192 I), and (c) an infected recovers with rate \u00b5 (I \u00b5 \u2212 \u2192 R). Both rates \u03b2 and \u03b3 are affected by the hand washing levels. Here, we keep our analysis simple by using the conventional SIR model with the assumption that if infected individuals wash hands frequently, there is smaller probability to contaminate surfaces or other healthy people directly.",

Following a study in a college town environment, we consider that only the 67% of the compliers wash their hands properly (i.e. with water and soap and for the recommended by CDC duration of time 39 ), while the rest 33% are wetting their hands quickly and/or without soap 40 . Therefore, we assume that in an airport population of N individuals only the 70% \u00b7 67% = 49.6% of N are compliers with effective hand washing. Furthermore, we assume that each individual wash their hands on average between 4-10 times per day 41 which means that in a 24-hour timeframe one event of hand washing takes place every 2.5-6 hours. We assume that the frequency of hand washing follows a normal distribution with mean equal to 4.5 hours and standard deviation equal to 1 hour. We also consider that the duration of cleanliness of hands after hand washing follows an exponential distribution with mean value equal to 1.5 hours.",

However, the concept of SIR reactions excludes the effects of individual hygiene activities (like hand washing) from the model of infection transmissions. In that case, the infection reaction process is considered as independent from the hand cleanliness of the infected individuals. In our initial analysis, we first use the SIR model (disregarding the impact of hand-hygiene behavior) to estimate the capacity of airports to spread an infectious disease globally. We seed the disease in each of the world major airports and through simulations we track the contagion dynamics two weeks after the outbreak. We rank the airports according to their spreading capacity as quantified by the TSD of infected individuals 32 (Figure 2 -middle) . From the analysis, it is observed that the total traffic alone cannot predict the power of an airport to spread the disease (comparing left and middle panels in Figure 2 ), but should be accounted alongside with the location of each spreader airport and the spatial correlations with other influential airports in the network. NRT (Narita International Airport, Tokyo, Japan) and HNL (Honolulu International Airport, Honolulu, USA) airports are indicative examples, as they ranked in the 46th and 117th place by total traffic respectively, but they have large contribution in the acceleration and expansion of a disease contagion globally (ranked by TSD on the 7th and 30th place respectively). This happens because NRT and HNL combine three important features with high impact on the disease spreading. These are (i) they have direct connections with the world's biggest mega-hub airports, (ii) they operate long-range in-and out-bound international flights, and (iii) they are located in geographical conjunctive points between East and West 32 .",

In the status quo scenario, we consider that hand cleanliness level is on a 20% steady state at each airport in the world. This percentage represents the fraction of individuals with washed hands at any moment. The rate of hand washing per hour that corresponds to 20% cleanliness is equal to 0.12 h -1 (see Table 2 ). We rank the airports in respect to TSD metric and we observe that LHR has the greatest impact while LAX, JFK, SYD and CDG are among the five most influential spreaders worldwide. Using the same order of airports, we repeat the simulations, by increasing the hand washing engagement rate homogeneously at all airports to achieve global hand cleanliness levels of 30%, 40%, 50% and 60%. For each hand washing engagement rate (or hand cleanliness level) we analyse the changes in the impact of contagion. Figure 3A shows the early-time evolution of the fraction of affected individuals over the first two weeks after a disease is seeded at DXB (Dubai Airport). Its observed that with the increase of hand cleanliness level at all airports from 20% to 60% there is a significant reduction in the percentage of the affected individual in the total population from around 1.5% to less than 0.5%. In Figure 3B we demonstrate the spreading power of the most influential spreader airports measured by TSD of infected individuals two weeks after a disease was initiated at each of these major airports, at 20% (status quo), 30%, 40%, 50% and 60% of homogeneous hand cleanliness. A drastic, very significant reduction in TSD is observed with the increase of cleanliness level, verifying that hand-hygiene is one of the most important factors to control or even prevent an infection. For example, the spread of infection seeded in LHR was covered about 5 \u00b7 10 5 square meters around the mass centre of the infection within two weeks, while infected area was reduced to less than 2 \u00b7 10 5 square meters when cleanliness level increased from 20% to 60% globally. The relative to the status quo reduction of the disease impact is calculated by (T SD 20% \u2212 T SD X )/T SD 20% for the TSD metric or (PREV 20% \u2212 PREV X )/PREV 20% for the disease prevalence metric, where the cleanliness level X increases from 30% to 60% worldwide. The results are shown in Table 2 indicate a significant reduction of the impact of a disease worldwide by 24% to 69% depending on the hand washing engagement rate worldwide using the calculated by the TSD (or by 18% to 55% as calculated by the global prevalence of the disease).",

Using well-established methodologies, we have applied simulations to track traveling agents and their hand washing activity and analysed the expansion of flu-type epidemics through the world air transportation network. From the simulation results, we have measured the early-time spreading power of the major airports in the world under different hand-hygiene interventions. Using data-driven calculations, we estimated that mostly 1 over 5 people are cleaned at any given moment in time (i.e. 20% of airport population). This is translated to hand washing engagement rate among the non-cleaned individuals equal to 0.12 per hour (i.e. every hour about 12% of the non-cleaned individuals are washing their hands). From simulation results we have shown that, if we are able to increase the level of hand cleanliness at all airports in the world from 20% to 30% (or equivalently to increase the hand washing engagement rate from 0.12 to 0.21 per hour), either by increasing the capacity of hand washing and/or by increasing the awareness among individuals and/or by giving the right incentives to individuals, a potential infectious disease will have a worldwide impact that is about 21.2% smaller compared to the impact that the same disease would have with the 20% level of hand cleanliness (or 0.12 per hour hand washing engagement rate). Increasing the level of hand cleanliness to 60% (or equivalently the hand washing engagement rate among non-cleaned individuals to 0.73 per hour) at all airports in the world would have a reduction of 64.6% in the impact of a potential disease spreading. Moreover, we have identified the ten most important airports of the network, for which increasing the level of hand cleanliness (or hand washing engagement rate) only at those, the impact of the disease spreading would decrease by 9% to 37%.",

A second limitation is that we use data from the air transportation system as a proxy for human mobility. A complete analysis should focus on the spread of infections through a more realistic human mobility network that includes daily commuting patterns and travel through other means of transportation. A third limitation is the assumption of a homogeneous hand-hygiene behavior of air travelers, as we do not know the actual hand washing activity that varies between individuals within a local population and between individuals from different societies and cultures.

Outbreaks reduce the consumption of goods and services, negatively affecting the tourism industry, increasing businesses' operating costs, and speeding the flight of foreign capital, generating massive economic costs globally. For instance, even the relatively short-lived SARS epidemic in 2003 led to the cancellation of numerous flights and to the closure of schools, wreaking havoc in Asian financial markets and ultimately costing the world economy more than $30 billion 43 . Hypothetical scenarios of future global pandemics give estimates on the economic effects. The worldwide spread of a severe infectious disease is estimated to cause approximately 720,000 deaths per year and an annual reduction of economic outcome of $500 billion (i.e. \u223c0.6% of the global income) 44 . In such severe scenarios where markets shut down entirely, a massive global economic slowdown is expected to occur shrinking the GDP of national economies. Of course, wealth and income effects are expected to differ sharply across countries, with a major shift of global capital from the affected economies (i.e. of developing countries) to the less-affected economies (i.e. of North America and Europe).",

The target of each strategy is to maximise the social welfare by incurring in the minimum economic cost. For interventions where travel restrictions are implemented 46 , the cost increases with the number of closed airports and the number of individuals that get stranded in those airports. The reward is related to the relative decrease in the global footprint of the disease, compared with the null case of non-interventions. In contrast to the mobility-driven strategies that change the population's mobility patterns, other solutions such as hand washing appear to be more cost-and reward-effective. A future research on the socio-economic impact of global pandemics and the cost-effectiveness ratio of different mitigation strategies (e.g. hand washing, vaccination, airport closures, mobility routing diversions) against disease spreading would evaluate the efficiency and significance of hand-hygiene interventions. However, while hand hygiene is considered as the first prevention step in the case of an epidemic emergency, the capacity of hand washing facilities in crowded places, including airports, is limited only to wash basins at restrooms. It is not known, however, if increased capacity would enhance hand washing engagement by air travelers. New technology is being developed aiming to increase the capacity of facilities even outside restrooms, thus expanding the options for hand hygiene and the solutions for air and surface sterilization. Airbus 47 , for example, is exploring an innovative antimicrobial technology that is able to eliminate viruses and pathogens from aircraft surfaces (e.g. tray tables, seat covers, touch screens, galley areas). Boeing is also exploring a prototype self-sanitizing lavatory that uses ultraviolet light to kill 99.99% of pathogens 48 . At the same time, robotic systems for dirt detection and autonomous cleaning of contaminated surfaces 49 and smart touch-free hand washing systems 50 are promising tools on the evolution of cleaning technologies.",
