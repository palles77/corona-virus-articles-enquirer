Hospitalized patients with CAP were grouped according to the pneumonia severity index (PSI), as non-severe (PSI<91 points) or severe (PSI\u226591 points). Blood and sputum samples were collected upon admission. Compared to non-severe CAP patients, the severe CAP group showed higher plasma levels of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines but in contrast, lower sputum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Blood neutrophil functional responses were elevated in CAP patients compared to healthy controls. However, neutrophils from severe CAP patients showed reduced respiratory burst activity compared to the non-severe group. Results indicate that patients with severe CAP fail to mount a robust local pro-inflammatory response but exhibit instead a more substantial systemic inflammatory response, suggesting that a key driver of CAP severity may be the ability of the patient to generate an optimal local inflammatory response.",

In order to control for the potential interference of the DTT contained in the sputum samples on the measurement of the different cytokines in the Multiplex assay, we evaluated the effect of DTT by running samples of known cytokine concentrations in the presence and absence of DTT (at 0.0125 %, the same final concentration in the sputum samples). For eight out of the ten cytokines measured (IL-1\u03b2, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-17, IFN\u03b3, TNF\u03b1, and CXCL8), there was little if any interference, with measurements in the presence of DTT being, on average, within \u00b125 % of controls. In the case of IL-10 and CXCL10, measurements in the presence of DTT showed average reductions of 50-60 % compared to controls.

Basal or formyl-methionyl-leucylphenylalanine (fMLF)-stimulated exocytosis were determined by measuring the plasma membrane expression of secretory vesicles (CD35, clone E11) and specific granules (CD66b, clone G10F5, both from BioLegend, San Diego, CA) on a FACSCalibur instrument (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Following antibody treatment, red cells were lysed with BD red cell lysis buffer (Becton Dickinson), followed by two washes with 0.05 % sodium azide, and fixation in 1 % paraformaldehyde before analysis. Phagocytosis and phagocytosis-stimulated respiratory burst activity were measured using a flow cytometric assay based on the production of H 2 O 2 stimulated by the phagocytosis of Staphylococcus aureus, as previously described [14] . Briefly, neutrophils (2\u00d710 6 cells/ml) were incubated with 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (0.5 \u03bcM final concentration) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. Then, 50 \u03bcl aliquots of the cell suspension were sampled before and 10 min after the addition of opsonized, propidium iodide-labelled S. aureus (at a final concentration of 10 8 bacteria/ml). After fixation in 1 % paraformaldehyde, the cells were then analyzed for phagocytosis and H 2 O 2 production by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur instrument.",

Nevertheless, the positive and statistically significant correlation found between neutrophil respiratory burst activity and the systemic levels of CXCL10 is interesting. A role for ROS in the activation of signaling mechanisms, including STAT-1 phosphorylation, involved in the secretion of CXCL10 has been reported [16] .

Because of the heavy predominance of neutrophils in sputum compared to BAL, cytokine levels in the former may be more representative of a neutrophil response. A separate study by Lee et al.

A recent meta-analysis indicates that some of the most commonly-used scores such as PSI and CURB-65, previously derived and validated to predict 30day mortality, have only moderate performance to predict ICU admission [12] . Moreover, it needs to be remarked that several factors influencing the PSI score may have direct effects on the inflammatory/immune response and, thus, be partially responsible for the observed results. Our two PSIbased severity groups differed significantly in terms of age and several co-morbidities. Aging is known to affect immune function at multiple levels, with both innate and adaptive immune responses being compromised with increased age [25] [26] [27] . Multiple studies, both in mice and humans, have analyzed the effect of senescence in macrophages and neutrophils, which are the main cells involved in the innate responses during CAP. Generally, macrophages and neutrophils from older individuals have been found to have deficits in the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), opsonization and phagocytosis, bacterial killing, chemotactic responses, and production of cytokines and chemokines [25] [26] [27] . However, age by itself does not seem to be the only factor accounting for the differences observed in our study since comparison of elderly (>65 years old) vs. non-elderly patients showed no significant differences in neutrophil functional parameters (results not shown).",

The presence of co-morbidities such as congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular diseases, and COPD, which are characterized by the presence of chronic inflammatory responses, neoplasia, and therapeutic corticosteroid use, may result not only in several defects in the function of immune cells, but also in the activation of several immunoregulatory mechanisms, including immunosuppressive cytokines and myeloid and lymphocytic regulatory cells [28] . Further studies are needed to better understand the contribution of the immune defects associated with these co-morbidities to the local lung response in CAP. In this regard, targeting of immunosuppressive mechanisms, particularly in the lung, may thus have a potential benefit for high risk CAP patients.",

When the excessive local inflammatory response fills the pulmonary compartment, there is a spill of cytokines and inflammation into the systemic circulation, generating the systemic inflammatory response that is associated with severe CAP. The data from our study seem to indicate that, an exaggerated local inflammatory response is not associated with severe CAP, and on the contrary, patients with severe CAP have a significantly lower pulmonary inflammatory response in relation to patients with non-severe CAP. In agreement with the literature [7, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] , we found that patients with severe CAP have a significantly higher level of systemic inflammation, but the initial step to reach this systemic inflammation may not be an excessive local pulmonary inflammation. It can be hypothesized that, patients who are able to produce an adequate local pulmonary response are able to contain the microorganisms, do not develop an exaggerated systemic response, and present with a non-severe CAP. If a first response at the local pulmonary level is not sufficient due to some local level of immune deficiency, then a second response at a systemic level is elicited as the last attempt to control the infection. If this paradigm were to be correct, and patients with severe CAP have dual inflammatory responses with a low pulmonary response and a high systemic response, then the therapeutic management of inflammation in patients with severe CAP should be different for the lung and for the systemic circulation.",
