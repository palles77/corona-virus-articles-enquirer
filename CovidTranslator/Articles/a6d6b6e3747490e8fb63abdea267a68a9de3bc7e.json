Our aim was to determine whether the microbes present in the nasopharynx before an ALRI were associated with its onset. A retrospective case-control/crossover study among Indigenous children aged up to 2 years. ALRI cases identified by medical note review were eligible where nasopharyngeal swabs were available: (1) 0-21 days before ALRI onset (case); (2) 90-180 days before ALRI onset (same child controls); and (3) from time and agematched children without ALRI (different child controls). PCR assays determined the presence and/or load of selected respiratory pathogens. Among 104 children (182 recorded ALRI episodes), 120 case-same child control and 170 case-different child control swab pairs were identified. Human adenoviruses (HAdV) were more prevalent in cases compared to same child controls (18 vs 7%; OR = 3.08, 95% CI 1.22-7.76, p = 0.017), but this association was not significant in cases versus different child controls (15 vs 10%; OR = 1.93, 95% CI 0.97-3.87 (p = 0.063). No other microbes were more prevalent in cases compared to controls. Streptococcus pneumoniae (74%), Haemophilus influenzae (75%) and Moraxella catarrhalis (88%) were commonly identified Heidi C.

Worldwide, many studies have identified the presence of viruses and bacteria in children's respiratory secretions during an ALRI [7] ; however, the contribution to infection of individual microbes, polymicrobial communities, and microbe-host interactions at the individual and population levels remains poorly understood. Furthermore, the value of nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) for informing microbiology in the lung has been questioned. For example, in NT children hospitalized with pneumonia, nasopharyngeal bacteria and viruses were not associated with clinical signs on admission or during recovery [6] , questioning the utility of NPS taken at the time of ALRI in clinical diagnosis or for prognosis in children with already high carriage of respiratory pathogens. Recent data from the PERCH study confirmed the limited value of cross-sectional NPS for diagnosing ALRI [8] .",

In a large childhood pneumonia aetiology study in South Africa where a high incidence of pneumonia is reported, RSV in NP swabs was most strongly associated with pneumonia in case-control comparisons followed by IFV, HBoV, HAdV, and cytomegalovirus [21] . Additional analysis of induced sputum specimens also identified Bordetella pertussis, H. influenzae type b, M. pneumoniae and PIV as associated with pneumonia [21] . Whilst a meta-analysis of 23 studies demonstrated that RSV, IFV, PIV, hMPV and HRV, were Table 1 . Viral and bacterial load data were unable to be assessed for one (different) case nasopharyngeal swab each. Odds ratios shown in Fig. 3 . # Not all nasopharyngeal swabs could be tested for C. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae: SCC comparison (87 cases/78 controls); DCC comparison (126 cases/116 controls). Adjustment for recent antibiotic use, presence of otitis media or pneumococcal conjugate vaccination did not alter the interpretation. Where cells contained no outcomes, p values were generated using an exact logistic regression model. Italics indicate statistically significant differences associated with ALRI in children aged < 5 years, there was no significant difference in detection of HAdV between cases and controls [22] . A recent prospective, community-based, longitudinal birth cohort study involving non-Indigenous Australian children also could not attribute parent-reported ALRI symptoms to detecting HAdV by PCR in weekly collected nasal swab specimens [23] . Nonetheless, HAdV disease outbreaks are known to occur; for example, types 2, 3, and 7 were observed in children during a 2011 Taiwan community outbreak, with type 7 associated with more severe disease [24] . HAdV outbreaks also occur in military training centres associated with crowded living conditions; however, reintroduction of a type 4 and 7 vaccine in 2011 was followed by a reduction in acute respiratory infection in this population [25] . Whilst HAdV type 7 (HAdV B) was detected in our study, HAdV C types were most common, as was shown previously in respiratory specimens in another Australian study [26] . Presence of a microbe may contribute to ALRI development, but may not be the primary or sole cause. Respiratory viruses can promote bacterial superinfection by multiple mechanisms that decrease bacterial clearance, increase bacterial adherence, and suppress immunity during recovery (reviewed [7] ). Bacteria can also promote viral infection by facilitating attachment to host cells or contributing to elevated virus production or release from airway cells (reviewed [7] ). However, a meta-analysis of 19 studies found that evidence to support the role of viral co-infection in increasing disease severity was inconclusive [27] . In our study, the only significant pathogen associations identified were between H. influenzae and HRV [28] .",

            "text": "A study strength was the case-crossover analysis designed to account for proximal risk factors, such as host (e.g. genetic) or environmental factors (e.g. smoke exposure) that could influence susceptibility to ALRI. Nevertheless, we performed a secondary analysis of specimens and data from studies not specifically designed to address our aim. Furthermore, diagnostic classification relied on clinic records which may lack accuracy. Additionally, ALRI episodes ranged from mild to severe disease, with an under-representation of hospital cases. This clinical heterogeneity may translate to microbial differences, and thus future studies should analyse the range of disease phenotypes. Indeed, where we previously found that 42% of NPS from Indigenous infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis were RSV-positive [29] , few NPS were RSV-positive for cases in the current study, despite bronchiolitis being a common diagnosis (56% of 182 episodes). This difference may be due to sampling of primarily non-hospitalized ALRI cases in infants outside the first 6 months of life. A limitation of ALRI studies based on NPS microbiology relates to inferring causation of infection at distal areas of the respiratory tract [8] . Whereas most studies have investigated microbial exposures concurrent to the outcome, our study captured the nasopharyngeal microbiology prior to the ALRI onset to account for the possibility of the original infecting organism being cleared. It is possible that pathogens detected in the case NPS may be cleared before an ALRI episode, or be acquired subsequently to NPS collection; however, a subanalysis of case NPS collected within 7 days of the ALRI episode identified HAdV trends consistent with the main analysis. Here, we investigated a high-risk population for ALRI (80% affected with 49% experiencing multiple ALRI episodes in the first 2 years of life), making us question the suitability of controls from this cohort. Whilst we attempted to prevent misclassification bias using strict criteria for control NPS specimens, the high background rate of pathogen-positive NPS and the design element that allowed case and control NPS to be sought from the same set of children, may bias the results towards the null hypothesis. Furthermore, the cross-sectional design limits conclusions that can be confidently drawn since our study was not designed to detect the contribution of new strain acquisitions of bacteria or viruses to ALRI onset, which is important in other respiratory disorders [30] , and is an area requiring further Conditional logistic regression was used to compare microbe co-detection between cases and controls where overall prevalence was above 10%. Grey cells represent significant differences (p < 0.05) in co-detection between cases and SCCs. With one swab missing respiratory bacterial data and another missing viral data, the SCC table denominators were bacteria-bacteria, n = 119; virus-virus, n = 119; viral bacterial-viral, n = 118 investigation in this population with high rates of respiratory bacterial colonization. In this pediatric population at high risk of ALRI, a high prevalence of several respiratory bacterial and viral pathogens was identified in NPS collected from cases in the period prior to ALRI onset, and in controls. Whilst our retrospective analysis was limited by several factors, HAdV was the only pathogen significantly associated with ALRI onset. We require a large set of longitudinal host, environmental and microbial data (including clinical phenotype and microbial strain) modelled to account for multiple parallel effects to unpack these complex interactions and to inform the use or development of targeted interventions to reduce the ALRI burden in this highrisk population.",
