            "text": "Bats have been identified as a natural reservoir for several potentially zoonotic viruses. Recently, astroviruses have been reported in bats in many countries, but not Korea. We collected 363 bat samples from thirteen species at twenty-nine sites in Korea across 2016 and tested them for astrovirus. The detection of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene in bat astroviruses was confirmed in thirty-four bats across four bat species in Korea: twenty-five from Miniopterus fuliginosusi, one from Myotis macrodactylus, four from M. petax, and four from Rhinolophus ferrumequinum. The highest detection rates for astrovirus were found in Sunchang (61.5%, 8/13 bats), and in the samples collected in April (63.2%, 12/19 bats). The amino acid identity of astroviral sequences identified from bat samples was \u2265 46.6%. More specifically, the amino acid identity within multiple clones from individual bats was \u2265 50.8%. Additionally, the phylogenetic topology between astroviruses from different bat families showed a close relationship. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF2 sequence of bat astroviruses was found to have a maximum similarity of 73.3-74.8% with available bat astrovirus sequences. These results indicate potential multiple-infection by several bat astrovirus species in individual bats, or hyperpolymorphism in the astrovirus strains, as well as the transmission of astroviruses across bat families; furthermore, our phylogenetic analysis of the partial ORF2 implied that a novel astrovirus may exist. However, the wide diversity of astroviral sequences appeared to have no significant correlation with bat species or the spatiotemporal distribution of Korean bat astroviruses.",

These bats are distributed across a wide geographical area that includes Korea, Japan, and Russia [21] [22] [23] [24] . The discovery of astroviruses from these bat species has been reported in China and Hungary, but not Korea [25] [26] [27] . Bat astroviruses are known to have an exceedingly high genetic diversity. In a previous study, the amino acid similarity of the RdRp gene within bat astroviruses in Asia and Europe was verified to be ~49.2% [26, 28] . In this study, the amino acid identity of the partial RdRp gene in Korean bat astroviruses ranged from 46.6-100%, and the amino acid identity of astroviruses within a single bat species captured from the same habitat also ranged from 53.4-100%. Moreover, the amino acid identity of multiple astroviral strains from within an individual bat was 50.8-100%. This amino acid identity range within multiple clones of bat astroviruses indicated the existence of astrovirus haplotypes in Korean bats; the very low amino acid identity may indicate the possibility of infection by two or more astrovirus species in individual bats, or hyperpolymorphisms within identical astrovirus strains; however, more systematic studies and more genomic sequences are needed to verify this. Additionally, astroviruses are known to widely spread among Chiroptera and show no host restriction [15, 18, 25, 26] . Our result showed that astrovirus sequences in multiple clones from one M. fuliginosus bat were closely clustered with bat astroviruses from different host species: M. macrodactylus and R. ferrumequinum. In group D, the clustering between M. fuliginosus (BtAstV-BT54-1) and R. ferrumequinum (BtAstV-BF67-2) showed an amino acid similarity of \u2265 99%; this was supported by high posterior probabilities (pp = 0.99) from \u25b8 phylogenetic topology. These phylogenetic results suggest that genetic variants were generated at high rates within individual bats, and that active transmission events between bat species or families occurred between the Vespertilionidae and Rhinolophidae families. Furthermore, of the available astrovirus sequences, the partial amino acid sequence of ORF2 from two bat astroviruses was confirmed to have the highest identity (73.3-74.8%) with the bat astrovirus LC03 (FJ571074) and LS11 (FJ571067) sequences from China. It is unclear whether these represent novel astrovirus species according to ICTV guidelines [29] , as we could not characterize the entire ORF2 sequence. Therefore, further studies on the characterization of the whole genomes of bat astroviruses is necessary, as Korean bat astroviruses have not been comprehensively analyzed until now.",

The indiscriminate phylogenetic clustering of astroviral sequences obtained from different locations implies the direct (or indirect) transmission of bat astroviruses with no geographical restrictions in Korea. Additionally, astrovirus was highly prevalent in feces because astroviruses replicate in the gastrointestinal tract, and transmission has been found to occur through the oral-fecal route [34] .
