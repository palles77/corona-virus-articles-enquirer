According to this concept, latent load is treated by an independent system and the sensible load is treated by chilled-ceiling panels. In this work, four independent air dehumidification systems with energy recovery strategies are proposed. They are as follows: system 1, mechanical dehumidification with heat pump; system 2, mechanical dehumidification with sensible heat exchanger; system 3, mechanical dehumidification with membrane-based total heat exchanger; and system 4: a heat pump incorporating an active desiccant wheel and evaporative cooler. They are compared with a mechanical dehumidification system with no heat recovery. Hour-by-hour energy analysis is performed on the systems proposed. The results show that the system of mechanical dehumidification with membrane total heat recovery (system 3) consumes the least primary energy. However, since, the systems employ energy recovery measures, the energy savings for the four systems are in the same order, around 4.40!10 6 kJ per person. q",

SARS was controlled at last, but many challenges will remain for HVAC engineers: What can people do to prevent the pollutions of the indoor air by fatal pollutants such as SARS virus? The mechanism of the spread of SARS virus is complicated and still remains a mystery. However, it is believed that increased fresh air ventilation is helpful in decreasing the possibility of being infected by the disease.",

            "text": "Increased ventilation rates usually lead to high energy consumption in air-conditioning. This is because the relative humidity in a occupied building must be controlled to within 40-60% for health and comfort. Ventilation air is the major source of moisture load in air conditioning. As shown in Fig. 1 for a moisture load estimation of a medium size retail store [1] , ventilation air constitutes about 68% of the total moisture load in most commercial buildings. As a consequence, treatment of the latent load from the ventilation air is a difficult and imminent task for HVAC engineers, especially in hot and humid climates like South China. There are various techniques for air dehumidification [2] . Traditionally, latent load and sensible load are treated in a coupled way. A schematic of the method and the processes in a psychrometric chart are shown in Fig. 2 . Ambient air is mixed with return air first. Then the mixed air (state 2) flows through an AHU (air handling units) where it is cooled and dehumidified. It should be mentioned that to remove moisture, all the air must be cooled to below its dew point at state 3, (around 15 8C). Air at this temperature could not be directly supplied to room, to prevent cold-drafts and over-cooling that would cause discomfort to occupants. As a result, supply air is subsequently reheated by a heating coil to state 4 before distributed into the conditioned space. Because air is not only for ventilation, but also a heat transfer medium, and a large quantity of air is needed to extract the sensible load, energy requirements are very high. Another problem with this technique is that in transition seasons, when it is at part load conditions, humidity control will be lost [3] .",

According to this concept, the latent load of a room is treated by an independent humidity control system, while the sensible load is treated with some other alternative cooling techniques such as chilled-ceiling panels, or phase-change materials [4] [5] [6] . Since, the circulating air is dramatically reduced, energy consumption can be reduced substantially. Another benefit is that chilled water or suction temperatures can be raised, resulting in increased equipment efficiency and decreased operating costs. It is estimated that with a new system of chilled-ceiling panels combined with independent humidity control, 30% of energy could be saved in comparison to a traditional coupled system [7] [8] [9] . Nevertheless, due to the hot and humid climates in south China, energy for moisture control with an independent humidity control system still accounts for 25% of the total energy for air conditioning. To further reduce the energy consumption in the treatment of fresh air, energy recovery measures must be combined to an independent humidity control system.",

The sensible load of the room is treated by chilled-ceiling panels. The total ventilation load includes two fractions: moisture load from fresh air and moisture load from human activities.

First, fresh air is pre-cooled and partially dried by the mechanical dehumidifier. Then the air is dried more deeply and also reheated by the desiccant wheel. This arrangement uses both technologies at favorable points of performance. At higher inlet humidities, the mechanical refrigeration system can operate at a higher coil temperature and suction pressure, thereby saving energy. Dehumidified air from a desiccant wheel is very hot. Therefore, before it is supplied to rooms, it should be cooled down to set points first. To recover the energy from exhaust air, an evaporative cooler is used to cool down the exhaust air, which is then used to cool the supply air from desiccant wheel. Under extremely humid ambient conditions, energy required for re-activation exceeds available heat from the heat pump. In such cases, an auxiliary electric heater is used to accomplish the regeneration of the desiccant wheel. This system is relatively complex due to the rotating character of the wheel and the reactivation of the desiccants. If low grade waste heat is available, the desiccant wheel system becomes superior to other systems in energy efficiency (Fig. 6 ). The system with no heat recovery is shown in Fig. 7 .
