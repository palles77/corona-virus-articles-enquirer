Here we explore the use of interferon-\u03b2 to adjuvant the response to a rabies virus (RV) vaccine vector expressing both HIV-1 Gag and IFN-\u03b2. Viral load and immune responses of immunized mice were analyzed over time. Our results indicate that the RV expressing IFN-\u03b2 (IFN(+)) is highly attenuated when compared to control RV and demonstrate that the expression of IFN-\u03b2 reduces viral replication approximately 100-fold. Despite the decrease in replication, those mice immunized with the IFN(+) RV had a significantly greater number of activated CD8+ T cells. The increased activation of CD8 + T cells was dependent on IFN-\u03b2 signaling, as we saw no difference following infection of IFNAR \u2212/\u2212 mice. Although mice immunized with IFN(+) have a greater primary immune response than controls, immunized mice that were challenged with vaccinia expressing Gag had no significant difference in the number or functionality of CD8+ T cells. The increased CD8+ T cell activation in the presence of IFN-\u03b2, even with greatly reduced viral replication, indicates the beneficial effect of IFN-\u03b2 for the host.",

Although wild type RV almost always causes a fatal CNS disease in mammalian species (Dietzschold, Faber, and Schnell, 2003) , in its attenuated form, RV has proved to be an excellent vaccine vector (Faber et al., 2005; McGettigan et al., 2003b; McKenna et al., 2007; Siler et al., 2002) . Furthermore, attenuated RV has been shown to induce both a strong cellular and humoral immune response to foreign genes (McGettigan et al., 2003a; McKenna et al., 2007; McKenna et al., 2003) . RV has a relatively simple genome organization encoding five structural proteins: a nucleoprotein (N), a phosphoprotein (P), a matrix protein (M), a glycoprotein (G), and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). RV-N encapsidates the viral RNA and together with RV-P and polymerase L composes the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. RV-M bridges the RNP complex with the transmembrane domain of RV-G (Mebatsion, Weiland, and Conzelmann, 1999) . Both RV-M and RV-G facilitate virion budding from an infected cell (Mebatsion, Konig, and Conzelmann, 1996; Mebatsion, Weiland, and Conzelmann, 1999) .",

Additionally, subsequent to transfection with two recombinant adenovirus (Ad) vectors, it was seen that DCs up-regulated the expression of phenotypic activation markers. The increase was independent of viral replication and toll like receptor (TLR) signaling. However, there was only a marginal increase of co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of BM-DC derived from IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting that the maturation of Ad-transduced cells was dependent on type I IFN signaling (Hensley et al., 2005) .

This function also suggests that it may be a valuable adjuvant in vaccine development. However, much of the work supporting the immune-modifying functions of IFN-\u03b2 have been done in vitro; therefore, the potential use of IFN as an adjuvant in vaccine development needs to be further investigated. In an attempt to induce IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 expression in a vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), Martinez-Sobrido et al. inserted the RSV-F protein into a Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine vector. Although the recombinant virus increased IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 levels, as predicted, and protected mice against RSV challenge the mechanism of protection was unclear, because similar protection was seen in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 and wild type mice (Martinez-Sobrido et al., 2006) . When combining multiple viral proteins, it may be impossible to distinguish the direct effects of the interferon from the immunological response to the additional protein. Furthermore, different viruses have several distinct features in addition to their ability to induce IFN, which make results difficult to analyze. Here we use a system in which IFN-\u03b2 is expressed by the RV vaccine vector in order to compare the immune responses induced in the presence or absence of increased levels of IFN-\u03b2.",

Although little evidence is available to link the beneficial outcome of a RV infection to increased CTL responses against RV as a vaccine vector, increased CTL responses to the foreign antigen may be required. In order to further investigate the potential immune-enhancing effects of IFN-\u03b2, we constructed two recombinant Rabies viruses, one expressing both HIV-1 Gag and IFN-\u03b2 and the other expressing HIV-1 Gag and IFN-\u03b2 minus the ATG start codon. Our data support the hypothesis that IFN-\u03b2 works at the interface of the innate and adaptive immune response by sustaining the pool of activated antigen-specific CD8+ lymphocytes. Thus, in addition to controlling viral replication (a wellstudied effect of type I IFN), we provide evidence that IFN-\u03b2 also directs the cells of the adaptive immune system to adequately respond to a pathogen. Elucidating the immunemodifying effects of type I IFN is important in determining whether the addition of this cytokine can enhance the cellular response and increase the potency of RV based vaccine vectors.",

We detected only background levels of IFN-\u03b2 in the supernatants of BSR cells infected with IFN(\u2212), presumably due to the IFN antagonistic activity of RV-P (Brzozka, Finke, and Conzelmann, 2005; Brzozka, Finke, and Conzelmann, 2006; Vidy, Chelbi-Alix, and Blondel, 2005; Vidy et al., 2007) . On the other hand, BSR cells infected with the IFN(+) virus produced approximately 3.5 \u03bcg/ml IFN-\u03b2, which is a 1000-fold increase over background. Next, we aimed to assess the biological functionality of the IFN-\u03b2 expressed by the recombinant RV. Briefly, we infected BSR cells with IFN(+), IFN(\u2212) or BNSP for 48 hours. The supernatant from each sample was then collected and UV-inactivated. Serial dilutions of the supernatants were then used to pre-treat mouse NA cells for 24 h prior to infecting the NA cells with recombinant VSV expressing GFP (Stojdl et al., 2003) . Five hours after infection with VSV-GFP, NA cells were analyzed for expression of GFP, a marker for VSV replication in our system. Type I IFN is known to efficiently inhibit VSV replication in neurons (Trottier, Palian, and Reiss, 2005) ; thus, if functional IFN-\u03b2 is present in the supernatant, we should not see GFP expression. As shown in Figure 1C , only supernatants from IFN(+) infected cells efficiently inhibited VSV replication, indicating the presence of functional IFN-\u03b2 in that sample.",

It is well documented that IFN-\u03b2 is a potent anti-viral; therefore, we analyzed growth kinetics on both type I IFN responsive and non-responsive cells. It was determined that both NA and BSR cells can produce type I IFN following Sendai virus infection. Of the two, however, only NA cells are responsive to mouse IFN-\u03b2 and, thus, able to inhibit VSV replication (data not shown). Cells were infected with an MOI of 0.1 (multi-step) or 10 (one-step). Aliquots of the supernatants were collected at various time points, and the titers were determined. The multistep and one-step growth curves derived from infected BSR cells illustrated that IFN(+) and IFN (\u2212) viruses grew with similar kinetics and to relatively equal titers ( Figure 2A , C), indicating that the expression of IFN-\u03b2 did not affect viral growth by a type I IFN independent mechanism. Of note, the titer for both IFN(+) and IFN(\u2212) viruses was about 10-fold less than the titer of the parent virus strain, BNSP-Gag, at all time points presumably due to the insertion of the IFN-\u03b2 gene between RV G and RV L. However, when IFN-\u03b2 sensitive cells were used, there was a significant difference in the growth kinetics of IFN(+) and IFN(\u2212) RV. For both one-step and multi-step growth curves there is a delay in viral growth and approximately a 2.5 to 3 log decrease in the final titer of the IFN(+) virus ( Figure 2B , D). Thus, IFN-\u03b2 expressed by RV exhibits antiviral properties when grown on IFN sensitive cells.",

We infected the mice intranasally in order to see the effect on pathogenicity, because it has been shown that the first generation vaccine vector, BNSP-Gag, is apathogenic after peripheral inoculation while still lethal after intranasal or intracranial inoculation (McGettigan et al., 2003b) .

This shows the immune response to the entire vaccine vector and not just to the HIV-1 gag protein. Surprisingly, we saw that, despite a large decrease in viral load in IFN(+) infected animals at 8 dpi, there were similar numbers of activated CD8+ T cells recovered from IFN(+) and IFN(\u2212) infected animals. Furthermore, at 12 dpi, there was a significant increase in the percentage of activated CD8+ splenocytes in the IFN(+) infected animals despite the 100-fold decrease in viral antigen ( Figure 3C , D). Thus, although mice infected with the IFN(+) virus probably had a lower amount of viral antigen at 8 and 12 dpi due to the anti-viral effects of IFN-\u03b2, these mice had similar (day 8) or significantly greater (day 12) CD8+ T cell responses. In order to determine whether this effect is specific to the route of immunization we also looked for T cell activation in the inguinal lymph nodes and spleens of mice immunized intramuscularly. Consistent with what was seen after intranasal immunization, 8 dpi there was no significant difference between the activated T cells found in the IFN(+) and IFN(\u2212) immunized mice (data not shown).

We saw that at day 19 the level of viral RNA message was decreasing and most of the mice have around 10 2 copies of viral mRNA/\u03bcg RNA ( Figure 4E ). Of note, the one mouse that had a high level of viral messenger RNA 19 dpi had the lowest amount of virus at 15dpi, thus it is possible that the kinetics of viral replication in that mouse was highly delayed. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the IFN(+) virus is persisting long term in the mice, but rather the kinetics of viral replication may be delayed by the addition of IFN-\u03b2.",

In addition, the percentage of CD44 hi CD62L lo cells in the CD8+ population was equal in mice immunized with IFN(+) or IFN(\u2212) ( Figure 5C , D).

At various hours post infection, we analyzed the activation of the APC by determining the expression of CD80 or CD86. Following infection of macrophage cells with either IFN(+) or IFN(\u2212), there was a dramatic upregulation of CD80 by 48 hpi ( Figure 6A ). However, there was no significant difference in the fold increase over uninfected cells in CD80 expression when comparing IFN(+) and IFN(\u2212) infected cells at any time point. Similarly, we saw that following infection of JAWSII cells with either IFN(+) or IFN(\u2212) RV equally induced the upregulation of CD86 expression ( Figure 6B ). In order to more clearly distinguish the effect of IFN-\u03b2 from the RV infection a supplementary experiment was performed in which the supernatant from IFN(+) or IFN(\u2212) infected JAWSII cells was used to activate uninfected JAWSII cells. After 24 or 48h, there was no significant difference in the activation state, as determined by expression of CD80 and CD86, of JAWSII cells treated with UV-inactivated supernatant from IFN(+) or IFN(\u2212) infected cells compared to cells treated with uninfected supernatant. Thus, it seems that incorporating IFN-\u03b2 into the RV construct does not significantly increase DC activation. Therefore, it seems unlikely that the difference we observed in CD8+ T cell activation was a result of increased co-stimulation by APCs.",

We see that IFN-\u03b2 expression efficiently decreases the viral titer and reduces vector pathogenicity (Figure 2 and 3A) . Therefore, IFN-\u03b2 could be added to RV-based vaccine vectors to reduce vector-associated pathogenicity and to increase safety. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of IFN-\u03b2 could potentially lead to a self-limiting infection, making it more appealing for use in immuno-compromised individuals. Increased expression of type I IFN during priming has a significant effect on the cellular immune response. Despite having significantly less viral antigen, there was a significantly greater percentage of activated CD8 + T cells in the spleen at 12 dpi ( Figure 3 ). This highlights the potential strength for using IFN\u03b2 as an adjuvant in vaccine development. Although there is a significant effect on the primary immune response, the memory immune response seems to be unaffected by the addition of IFN-\u03b2 into the RV vaccine vector (Figure 8 ). We hypothesize that the anti-viral activity of IFN\u03b2 during priming counterbalanced the immune-enhancing capability of IFN-\u03b2 and thus no significant increase on memory cell formation was achieved.",

Surprisingly, we saw that at 12 dpi CD8+ T cell activation was significantly greater following infection with the IFN(+) virus, despite the noted 100-fold decrease in viral load. Furthermore, with 1000-fold less virus in the brain at 8 dpi, there was still an equal activated CD8+ T cell response. Both of these facts indicate that IFN-\u03b2 is a potent adjuvant for cellular immunity. Furthermore, the studies in IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice indicate that the differences seen here are type I IFN dependent. This data supports the use of IFN-\u03b2 to enhance the immune response to vaccine vectors that are given even at a low MOI.",

In our hands, APC activation does not seem to be affected by increased levels of IFN-\u03b2. Infection with RV however is not the only viral infection that induces APC maturation in a type I IFN independent manner. Similarly, DC maturation following Sendai virus infection has been shown to work independently of the IFN pathway (Lopez et al., 2003) . Although a strong correlation between DC maturation and type I IFN induction was observed, it was determined using anti-IFN antibodies that the secreted IFN was neither necessary, nor sufficient to induce full DC maturation (Lopez et al., 2003) . Furthermore, it was seen that, following adenovirus infection, type I IFN was necessary for DC to undergo full maturation. However, both wildtype and IFNAR\u2212/\u2212 mice could mount a strong antigenspecific CD8+ T cell response (Hensley et al., 2005) . Therefore, it is not surprising that the differences we saw in CD8+ T cell activation in the presence or absence of exogenous IFN-\u03b2 were not functions of DC and macrophage activation.",

Although our transfer experiment does not definitively prove that IFN\u03b2 is needed to sustain a population of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, the experiment supports this conclusion. Therefore, it is likely that IFN-\u03b2 signaling through a receptor on a CD8+ T cell is required either as a signal to promote differentiation of effector cells or as a signal to resist activation-induced cell death. It was seen that IFN-\u03b1 or IL-12 treatment was required during na\u00efve CD8+ cell priming to induce proliferation and cytolytic activity. Beads coated with MHC I-peptide and CD80 co-stimulatory ligand are unable to sufficiently prime na\u00efve CD8+ T cells. However, T cells stimulated by the same beads in the presence of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 are capable of cytolytic function and IFN-\u03b3 production (Curtsinger et al., 2005) . On the other hand, IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 can also prevent activation-induced cell death of T cells following non-specific activation with staphylococcal enterotoxin B (Marrack, Kappler, and Mitchell, 1999) . Our model does not allow us to distinguish between these two possibilities; however, it is in support of a direct role for IFN-\u03b2 during priming. This piece of evidence is important and should be considered during vaccine development.",

However, there was much less antigen at the site of viral replication (the brain) in these mice. It has been suggested that there exists a diverse repertoire of T cells to a single epitope and that antigen load can influence in vitro recall responses (Naumov et al., 2006) . Furthermore, the antigen dose can influence the quality of the CD8+ T cell that is induced following infection. In a study done by Alexander-Miller it was seen that higher avidity cells were induced at lower peptide concentrations. However, it was also observed that lower avidity T cells preferentially survived into memory cells (Alexander-Miller, 2000) . Therefore, since memory cell differentiation is also impacted by the amount of antigen, the immuneenhancing effects of IFN-\u03b2 may be counter-balanced by low antigenic loads, thus yielding a minimal change to the overall memory cell development. Thus, IFN-\u03b2 may be a better adjuvant choice in a DNA or subunit vaccine where the vaccine vector is not deleteriously impacted by the cytokine.",

The result of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 signaling in an activated T cells is different then the response in a na\u00efve T cell. Na\u00efve human CD4+ T cells that were pre-treated with IFN-a had a delayed entry into the cell cycle. On the other hand, the presence of IFN-a following non-specific stimulation of human CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies did not inhibit T cell proliferation (Dondi et al., 2003) . This study did not however consider how type I IFN effects CD8+ T cells or memory precursor T cells.
