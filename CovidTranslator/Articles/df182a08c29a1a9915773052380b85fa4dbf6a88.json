Given the importance of disaster nursing training programmes, understanding how well prepared hospital nurses are to provide disaster care is vital. Objectives: This paper analyses the perceived readiness of hospital nurses for a disaster response and the factors influencing their report for work outside the hospital environment. Design: A cross-sectional research design was used. Settings: This study was conducted at a military hospital in Taiwan. Participants: A sample of 311 registered nurses participated in this study. Methods: Data were collected on readiness for disaster responses using a 40-item researcher-designed, self-administered questionnaire found to have satisfactory reliability and validity. The questionnaire has four domains: personal preparation (16 items), self-protection (11 items), emergency response (6 items), and clinical management (7 items). Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, independent t-tests and generalised linear models. Results: The majority of hospital nurses demonstrated poor readiness for disaster responses. Scores on the four domains were most associated with nurses' disaster-related training, experience in disaster response and emergency/intensive care experience. Conclusions: Our results indicate that disaster-related training should be included in undergraduate programmes and continuing education courses to help hospital nurses recognise and improve their own readiness for disaster responses outside the hospital environment. Future research is needed to improve hospital nurses' disaster-response readiness in Taiwan and other countries.",

However, hospital nurses might not feel ready and be available to care for patients during disasters despite their pre-deployment experiences with trauma, wound care, infection control or perioperative care (Evans and Baumberger-Henry, 2014) . Given the importance of disaster-nursing training programmes, nurse educators and administrators have a critical need to understand how well prepared hospital nurses are to provide disaster care. To address this need, therefore, this study assessed hospital nurses' readiness for responses to disasters outside the hospital environment and identified factors influencing their disaster-readiness knowledge, skills and attitudes in Taiwan.

Today, nurses assist in disaster responses with their technical skills and knowledge of epidemiology, physiology, pharmacology, psychology and the cultural background of survivors and their families during different catastrophic situations (International Council of Nurses, 2009 ). In addition, nurses must adapt to difficult and dangerous environments with scarce resources and changing conditions, which can differ greatly from their typical working environment (Gebbie and Qureshi, 2002) . Nurses must also have good communication skills to work collaboratively with other responders from various disciplines and officials involved at all levels of disaster preparedness (Stangeland, 2010) . Furthermore, nurse leaders should be savvy regarding disaster leadership competencies to encourage peers to work with each other in the constantly changing environments where disasters may strike (Coyle et al., 2007) .",

To decrease the impact of the disaster throughout its different phases, numerous nursing activities are required, including prevention or mitigation, preparedness, response, recovery, and reconstruction or rehabilitation. In particular, an early response is necessary to save as many lives as possible, to provide care to meet the affected population's immediate needs and to reduce the long-term health impacts of the disaster. However, over 80% of US hospital nurses were under-prepared before responding to a disaster event (Chapman et al., 2008) . Similarly, Taiwanese nurses who participated in earthquake relief in 1999 were impeded from functioning by suffering from facing unimaginable patient care decisions in an unfamiliar working environment with scarce resources and supplies (Shih et al., 2002) . Similar results were revealed among Chinese nurses who had participated in relief after the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake (Li et al., 2015) . Furthermore, Israeli nurses' readiness to respond to disaster events was found to be influenced by their perceived competencies, concerns about personal safety and concern for their family (Melnikov et al., 2014) . Before our study, little was known about how to guide hospital nurses in Taiwan about what to do when they leave their familiar working environment to provide care in environments with scarce resources.",

Indeed, Taiwan is one of the most vulnerable places on earth to natural hazards, with at least 73% of the land area and population exposed to the threat of more than three types of natural disasters (Dilley, 2005) . Once a disaster occurs, Taiwan's Central Emergency Operations Centre is activated to coordinate with the army's Joint Operations Command Centre and emergency medical assistance teams. During the past 15 years, several events (a catastrophic earthquake in 1999, the severe acute respiratory syndrome pandemic in 2003, and a water park explosion in 2015) have taught Taiwanese hospital nurses the importance of functioning effectively and efficiently during a disaster response, especially for the immediate and shortterm health needs of a disaster-stricken population. However, no reports have been published on hospital nurses' disaster readiness for themselves and their families. Therefore, it is imperative to assess hospital nurses' disaster readiness level and to identify factors associated with this disaster readiness.",

This finding is a matter of concern since the ability of response teams to remain effective in a dynamic disaster environment was shown to depend on trust relationships, open communication and group cohesion (Davis et al., 2007) .

The different emergency-response capabilities may be due to different continuing education programmes in the two study samples. For example, the experiences of Chinese nurses who had been dispatched to earthquake sites support the need to equip nurses with such essential emergency nursing skills before responding to a disaster (Yan et al., 2015) . Indeed, we confirmed that nurses with emergency/intensive nursing care experience reported higher scores in emergency response.

Similarly, a larger proportion of 946 nurses in mainland China with more clinical experience than without such experience reported greater willingness to work in disaster relief efforts (Loke et al., 2013) . These results suggest that educators could provide simulated crisis scenarios for nurses to practise their knowledge, skills and judgement during disaster-related situations, thus strengthening nurses' confidence and willingness to respond to disasters. Military nurses in this study scored higher in personal preparation than civilian nurses. This finding is due to military nurses in Taiwan being educated to respond to wartime operations and disaster relief beginning in their undergraduate programmes and continuously receiving disaster-related training after graduation. They are not only deployed for military actions, but also participate in planning disaster management. Similar results were found in surveys of US paediatric nurse practitioners (Goodhue et al., 2012) as well as military and government hospital nurses in Saudi Arabia (Al Thobaity et al., 2015) . Apparently, the more nurses are involved in disaster preparedness, the greater their readiness to respond.

In contrast, hospital nurses with disaster relief experience exhibited better scores than nurses without deployment experience, but the critical issue of maintaining their disaster-response competencies should be explored in future research. Therefore, nurse educators should provide nurses with all-hazard disaster training, so that nurses feel prepared to respond to natural or man-made disasters.
