            "text": "The central nervous system (CNS) contains a sophisticated neural network that must be constantly surveyed in order to detect and mitigate a diverse array of challenges. The innate and adaptive immune systems actively participate in this surveillance, which is critical for the maintenance of CNS homeostasis and can facilitate the resolution of infections, degeneration, and tissue damage. Infections and sterile injuries represent two common challenges imposed on the CNS that require a prompt immune response. While the inducers of these two challenges differ in origin, the resultant responses orchestrated by the CNS share some overlapping features. Here, we review how the CNS immunologically discriminates between pathogens and sterile injuries, mobilizes an immune reaction, and, ultimately, regulates local and peripherally-derived immune cells to provide a supportive milieu for tissue repair.",

The CNS, like any other organ system, must react to infection or tissue injury at the local level but also recruit help from the periphery to aid in efficient pathogen clearance and/or debris cleanup. Regulation of this immune response is crucial in protecting the CNS from further tissue damage due to immunopathology, and lingering inflammation can sometimes hinder the tissue repair process. This review will focus on relatively recent insights into our understanding of how the CNS responds immunologically to infection vs. injury and will center around two important questions. How does the CNS use the same fundamental immunological machinery to mount responses against these two different classes of inflammatory stimuli? Additionally, once underway how is the immune system regulated to limit pathology and foster repair in a sensitive organ system like the CNS?",

            "text": "Most immune responses begin with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) sensing pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) via Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-like receptors (RLRs), or Nod-like receptors (NLRs) [8] . Binding of PAMPs to these sensor receptors can activate the transcription factor NF\u03baB, which induces the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) [9] . In the case of a viral infection, RLR and TLR members will sense viral nucleic acids and induce expression of type-I interferons (IFN-I) via interferon regulatory factor (IRF) activation [10, 11] . Early production of IFN-I is critical in controlling the spread of CNS viral infections and often promotes host survival [12] . Even local CNS infections, like vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) introduced intranasally, induce distal IFN-I signaling throughout the brain [13] . The purpose of long-distance signaling is to generate a global CNS antiviral state and limit viral spread while waiting for pathogen-specific adaptive immune cells to arrive. IFN-I induces a diverse antiviral program in the CNS that can help coordinate immune activity after viral infection. For example, a recent study showed that IFN-I signaling is responsible for nearly all differential gene expression and innate immune cell dynamics following CNS infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) ( Figure 1 , Movie 1) [14] . LCMV is a non-cytopathic arenavirus recognized by cytosolic RLRs, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) [15] . In the absence of IFN-I signaling and antiviral T cells, LCMV established widespread persistence throughout the CNS, but induced almost no gene expression, microglia activation, or recruitment of circulating myelomonocytic cells [14] . The CNS was essentially \"na\u00efve\" despite viral persistence. These data demonstrate how instructive IFN-I signaling can be in the virally infected CNS and provide a possible explanation for why so many neurotropic viruses have acquired strategies to block this important pathway [16] . However, it is important to note that not all neurotropic viruses have such a strong reliance on IFN-I release for detection. Cytopathic viruses, for example, can alert the immune system through direct cellular damage and release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [17] .",

            "text": "CNS bacterial infections are detected via innate immune sentinels (e.g. microglia, macrophages) in a manner similar to viruses. Components of bacteria such as cell wall peptidoglycans, liposaccharides, and flagellin are sensed by inflammasome receptors like NLRP3, NLRC4, and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2). Inflammasomes form oligomeric structures in the cytoplasm, recruit caspase-1, and facilitate the proteolytic cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 into their secreted active forms [18] . For example, CNS microglia were shown in vitro to restrict growth of Legionella pneumophilia via NLRC4 [19] . Detection of bacterial flagellin was necessary to induce expression of caspase-1 and promote subsequent processing of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18 [19] . This type of inflammatory signaling is sometimes critically important in mounting the early defense against CNS-invading bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus infection of the CNS promotes inflammasome activation, and a recent study showed that 50% of mice deficient in caspase 1/11 or apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-1 recruitment domain (ASC) succumbed to infection within 24 hrs [20] . ASC is an adaptor protein that fosters recruitment of pro-caspase 1 to the inflammasome. Interestingly, the AIM2 (but not the NLRP3) inflammasome was identified as the critical ASC-dependent sensor in this model, as survival and production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines were both diminished in AIM2 \u2212/\u2212 mice [20] . In concert, these data demonstrate that immediate innate sensing of pathogens in the CNS not only promotes survival but sets the stage for a more comprehensive immune response that follows.",

            "text": "In addition to warding off invading pathogens, immune sentinels must also detect and respond to sterile injuries that disrupt CNS homeostasis. Most models of CNS injury such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) induce two phases of damage: the primary mechanical injury (e.g. severing of spinal cord tissue) and a secondary injury phase propagated by neurotoxic mediators such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), excitatory glutamate, and calcium, among others [21] . Similar to PAMP recognition of microbes, innate myeloid cells in the CNS sense sterile injuries via PRRs that bind to DAMPs ( Figure  1 ) [17] . DAMPS represent a variety of intracellular proteins and nucleic acids that are released upon cellular stress or necrosis [17] . Many members of the TLR, RLR, and NLR families recognize certain damage molecules as well as PAMPs [9, 17] . TLR4 has classically been associated with recognizing lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on gram-negative bacteria, but was also shown to bind DAMPs, such as heat shock proteins (Hsp60, Hsp70), chromatin-associated high-mobility group protein B1 (HMGB1), fibronectin, and fibrinogen following tissue damage [22] . The functional significance of this recognition in the injured CNS was recently studied in TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice exposed to controlled cortical impact (CCI) [23] -an animal model of TBI [24] . When compared to wild type controls, TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 mice had reduced brain lesions and secondary inflammation as well as improved neurological function following CCI, implicating TLR4 signaling in the pathogenesis of TBI [23] . Both microglia and neurons express TLR4 and addition of exogenous Hsp60 (a TLR4 ligand) to microglia/ neuron co-cultures promoted neuronal death, which was dependent on microglia TLR4 expression [25] . Direct injection of Hsp60 into the CSF also induced both neuronal and oligodendrocyte death through a mechanism dependent on TLR4 and MyD88 [25] . Interestingly, while LPS and Hsp60 share TLR4 as a receptor, intrathecal injection of Hsp60 did not induce glial activation or a robust pro-inflammatory response like LPS [25] , suggesting that the CNS responds differentially to endogenous vs. pathogen-derived TLR4 agonists.",

            "text": "Another DAMP released by neural and immune cells following CNS injury is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP can be liberated from dying cells or actively pumped out of intact cells via connexin or pannexin hemichannels, which serves as an inflammatory amplifier [26, 27] . ATP and its derivatives, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and adenosine, are detected by purinergic receptors that are divided into two classes: P1 receptors detect adenosine, whereas P2 receptors recognize ATP, ADP, and other nucleotides. A number of studies have demonstrated that purinergic receptor signaling plays an important role in CNS sterile injury responses [28] [29] [30] [31] . For example, intravital microscopy (IVM) studies revealed that focal laser injury in the brain induces purinergic receptor-dependent projections of microglia and astrocytes toward the injury site, which helps facilitate lesion containment and clean up [28] [29] [30] . Similarly, nucleotides released following focal cortical contusion (a model of mild TBI), trigger a robust microglial response dependent on purinergic receptor (P2X4R, P2Y6R, P2Y12R) signaling [31] . Following cortical contusion, microglia rapidly moved to the damaged glia limitans (a membrane comprised of astrocyte foot processes and basal lamina that separates the brain and spinal cord from the meninges) where they morphed into honeycomb-and jellyfish-like structures to support injured or dying astrocytes, respectively ( Figure 1 , Movie 1) [31] . Inhibition of this acute response via transcranial purinergic receptor (P2Y6R) or connexin hemichannel blockade enhanced breakdown of the glia limitans and cortical cell death, suggesting that this early inflammatory response to focal brain injury is neuroprotective [21, 31] .",

            "text": "The challenge with modulating purinergic receptors following CNS injury is that individual receptors are typically expressed on multiple cell populations. For example, P2X4R and P2X7R are two commonly expressed purinergic receptors in the CNS, and their stimulation can promote inflammasome activation [32] [33] [34] . Evaluation of P2X4R \u2212/\u2212 mice following spinal cord injury revealed reduced myelomonocytic cell infiltration and tissue damage [34] . Generation of bone marrow chimeras between wild type and P2X4R \u2212/\u2212 mice linked the neuroprotective effect of purinergic receptor deficiency to a CNS resident cell, possibly spinal cord neurons or microglia [34] . Interpretation of P2X7R blocking studies is similarly complicated by its expression pattern. The receptor is found on neurons, astrocytes, and neutrophils, among others. Following focal cortical contusion, transcranial P2X7R antagonism increased cell death in the meninges, likely due to inhibition of neutrophil recruitment [31] . In contrast, blockade of this receptor following CCI or spinal cord injury decreased tissue pathology and improved recovery [35, 36] . Thus, purinergic receptor modulation can have differing effects depending on the nature, location, and timing of the CNS injury. In addition to the local effects on resident CNS cells, modulation of these pathways can also affect the recruitment and function of peripheral immune cells, which are known to express purinergic receptors [26] .",

For example, following CNS infection, both innate (monocytes, neutrophils) and adaptive (CD8 + T cells, CD4 + T cells, B cells) immune cells are recruited to the CNS where they participate in pathogen containment/clearance (Figures 1, 2) . Sterile injuries, on the other hand, often rely more heavily on recruitment of innate myelomonocytic cells to aid in damage cleanup and initiation of repair (Figures 1, 2; Movies 1, 3) , although adaptive T and B cell responses can participate as well [37] . After spinal cord injury, it was found that monocytes are recruited to the injury site via distinct routes based on their activation phenotypes [38] . \"Classical\" monocytes (Ly6C hi CX3CR1 lo CCR2 hi ) with proinflammatory and phagocytic properties were the first to arrive following injury, which was followed days later by \"non-classical\" tissue-healing monocytes (Ly6C lo CX3CR1 hi CCR2 lo ) [38] . Interestingly, the Ly6C hi monocytes trafficked to the injury site via the leptomeninges proximal to the lesion in a CCR2-dependent manner, whereas the Ly6C lo were recruited via the brain ventricular CP in a VCAM-1-dependent manner and then trafficked through the CSF to the injury site [38] . It was proposed that the monocyte entry route influences their eventual function within the CNS, with those trafficking through CP and CSF playing a more anti-inflammatory role.",

These interactions are often critical in providing a defense against CNSinvading pathogens like LCMV, human immunodeficiency virus, West Nile virus (WNV), etc. WNV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that can cause a meningoencephalitis in humans. Using a rodent model of WNV infection, it was demonstrated that recruitment of innate cells and virus-specific T cells into the CNS is essential for viral control [40, 41] . Lymphocytes are recruited to the CNS and accumulate in perivascular spaces due to high levels of CXCL12 expression; they then migrate into the parenchyma when CXCL12 levels decline [42, 43] . IL-1\u03b2 is a key regulator in this process that can promote CXCL12 expression in cerebral microvasculature and restrict T cell movement into the parenchyma by promoting CXCR4-mediated T cell adhesion [42] . In general, the meninges and perivascular spaces are much more supportive of immune activity than the CNS parenchyma. For example, a recent IVM study showed that antiviral CD8 + T cells preferentially divide in the virally infected meninges vs. the parenchyma [44] . This finding was confirmed by another IVM study showing rare CD8 + T cell division in the brain parenchyma after infection with the intracellular parasite, Toxoplasma gondii [45] . Thus, the restrictions imposed on immune cells in the parenchyma are more stringent than those in the meninges and perivascular spaces. These restrictions likely limit the amount of immunopathology that develops in the CNS parenchyma at the cost of creating a more favorable environment for invading pathogens.",

            "text": "After a pathogen invades the CNS, the job of resident and peripherally recruited immune cells is to identify and remove the infection to prevent spreading and minimize tissue damage. This can be accomplished by cytopathic and non-cytopathic effector mechanisms (Figure 2 ), which have been reviewed elsewhere [46, 47] . The CNS is especially intolerant of immunopathology due to its abundance of irreplaceable cells (e.g. neurons). Nevertheless, cytotoxic CD8 + and helper CD4 + T cells with a pathogenic potential play an important role in CNS pathogen clearance. Following CNS infection with neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), delayed depletion of CD4 + T cells did not alter virus-specific CD8 + T cell recruitment into the CNS, but instead impaired their function (IFN\u03b3, granzyme b production) and survival, resulting in uncontrolled viral titers [48] . These data highlight the importance of helper T cells in maintaining effector CD8 + T cell responses during CNS infection. It is likely that CD4 + T cells similarly maintain effector B cells in the infected CNS, and this may be linked in part to local production of IL-21 by helper T cells [49] [50] [51] .",

            "text": "The mechanisms used by T cells to control pathogens are varied and include granzymes, perforin, IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, Fas ligand, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) (Figure 2 ). These effector molecules can promote pathogen clearance either by inducing death in infected cells (cytopathic) or by promoting clearance without cellular injury (noncytopathic) [46, 47] . A recent study of WNV revealed that mice deficient in TRAIL had significantly lower survival rates and elevated viral titers in the CNS, but not peripheral tissues [52] . It was further revealed in this study that CD8 + T cells used TRAIL to help control WNV in infected neurons. TRAIL-mediated control of WNV is just one example of how T cells protect the CNS; however, it is important to note that this protection sometimes has negative consequences [53] . During LCMV meningitis, CD8 + T cells can induce a pathogenic recruitment of innate myelomonocytic cells that break down cerebral blood vessels and contribute to fatal CNS edema ( Figure 1 , Movie 2) [54] . CD8 + T cells can also release IFN-\u03b3 onto virally infected neurons, promoting loss of dendrites and synapses [55] . In contrast, another recent study showed that cerebral pathology does not always result from antiviral T cell activity in the infected CNS. Therapeutic administration of antiviral CD8 + and CD4 + T cells to mice persistently infected from birth with LCMV resulted in noncytopathic clearance of virally infected microglia following conversion into CD11c + APCs (Movie 3) [56] . Importantly, this clearance was achieved in an IFN-\u03b3-dependent manner without evidence of myelomonocytic cell recruitment, vascular breakdown, or microglia cell death. These data suggest that infected microglia can resist cytopathic effector mechanisms and that antiviral T cells operating alone in the virally infected CNS are not always inherently pathogenic.",

Microglia are usually among the first responders to sterile injuries, and one of their primary roles is clearing debris and dead cells from the lesion site [57] . They also help maintain the integrity of CNS barrier structures like the glia limitans ( Figure 1, Movie 1) . Monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) recruited to the injury site from the periphery also participate in phagocytosis, but their arrival is usually delayed by hours or days. One day after SCI, injured axons are engulfed primarily by microglia [58] . However, at day 3 post-SCI, the balance shifts with the infiltration of MDMs from local meningeal vessels or the CSF via choroid plexus. By day 7, MDMs are the predominant population in contact with injured axons. There is evidence that TLR4 has a role in the phagocytosis of degenerating axons, as microglia from TLR4 \u2212/\u2212 (but not TLR3 \u2212/\u2212 ) mice are significantly impaired in clearing axonal debris in vitro and in vivo [59] . Clearance of axonal debris by microglia is thought to pave the way for regrowth of axons.",

            "text": "Another major component of cellular debris that is phagocytosed after injury is myelin, an insulating sheath produced by oligodendrocytes that surrounds CNS axon fibers (Figure 2 ). Studies have shown that myeloid cells can acquire either pro-or anti-inflammatory properties following myelin ingestion [60, 61] . For example, myelin-containing macrophages in multiple sclerosis lesions (a human demyelinating disease) are thought to possess anti-inflammatory functions [60] . In contrast, SCI induces bone marrow-derived macrophages to transition from anti-to pro-inflammatory within a week of injury [61] . Upon continual acquisition of myelin debris, the phagocytic capacity of myeloid cells can eventually become saturated, resulting in enhanced inflammation and neurotoxicity. This pro-inflammatory state is maintained by iron accumulation and the release of TNF-\u03b1 by macrophages [62] . Thus, the role played by myeloid cells in the damaged CNS probably depends on the duration and magnitude of the injury. Having CNS-resident and peripherallyderived myeloid cells both participate in debris cleanup at different stages of injury reduces the probability of the phagocytic system becoming saturated. A recent study demonstrated that for some injuries, peripherally-derived macrophages might not even be required for cleanup [63] . Upon oral ingestion, cuprizone induces oligodendrocyte death, and this toxin is commonly fed to rodents to induce acute demyelination, which is followed by remyelination after cuprizone is removed from the diet [64, 65] . Using this model, it was demonstrated that CCR2 + monocytes had no effect on the demyelination or remyelination process [63] . However, CX3CR1-deficiency greatly impeded the ability of microglia to clear myelin debris, which subsequently interfered with remyelination. These data further emphasize the importance of proper debris cleanup in facilitating CNS repair. Both microglia and peripherally-derived macrophages can participate in this process depending of the type of injury, but the system can become saturated over time, likely triggering a state of chronic inflammation.",

The timing of Treg involvement is crucial during CNS infections, as effector T cells are required for pathogen clearance early on, but their persistence can be detrimental to neural cells. In some cases, Treg-mediated immune suppression is beneficial, as in the case of WNV [72] ; however, in other instances of CNS infection, where the pathogen is the main cause of tissue damage, this type of immunosuppression is detrimental [73] . Following MHV infection of the CNS, depletion of Treg cells induced an exacerbated inflammatory response characterized by an enhanced infiltration of lymphocytes and increased apoptotic neurons, which was linked to the expansion of autoreactive CD4 + T cells [74] . Importantly, Treg cells can be used therapeutically to dampen antiviral T cell responses to CNS infections, an effect that is mediated in the CNS-draining cervical lymph nodes [75, 76] . Antiviral T cells can therefore be regulated even before they migrate into the CNS; however, mechanisms must also exist to regulate their survival and functions upon CNS infiltration.",

Resident microglia upregulate PD-L1 after Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection, which was demonstrated in vitro to depend on IL-6 and IFN-I signaling [78] . Another study found that IFN-\u03b3 could also induce upregulation of PD-L1 on cultured microglia, and both IFN-\u03b3-stimulated microglia and astrocytes were able to inhibit murine cytomegalovirus-specific CD8 + T cell activity when co-cultured together [79] . The importance of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway was examined in vivo using the MHV infection model [80, 81] . After MHV infection, PD-L1 was expressed primarily on oligodendrocytes, although transient expression on microglia was also observed. Genetic deletion of PD-L1 in mice improved viral control by CD8 + T cells, but also increased bystander axonal damage and morbidity, indicating that this regulatory pathway maintains a tolerable balance between viral control and immunopathology in the infected CNS. In addition to the PD-1 pathway, cells (e.g. macrophages, microglia, astrocytes) can also secrete immunosuppressive cytokines such as TGF-\u03b2 or IL-10 to dampen CNS inflammation following infection or injury ( Figure 2 ). As mentioned, monocytes are recruited to spinal cord lesions following injury, where they differentiate into macrophages [38] . These macrophages can acquire an immunoregulatory phenotype and produce IL-10. Depletion of monocytes/macrophages using CD11c-diphtheria toxin receptor mice was shown to enhance microglial activation and reduce spontaneous recovery following SCI [82] . Adoptive transfer of wild type (but not IL-10 deficient) monocytes into depleted animals restored spontaneous recovery, demonstrating that the engagement of anti-inflammatory pathways by MDMs is an important part of the tissue repair process following SCI. IL-10 can also suppress innate and adaptive immune cells following CNS infection [83] [84] [85] . Infection of IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 mice with neuro-adapted Sindbis virus resulted in an accelerated paralytic disease that was linked to an increased recruitment of pathogenic CD4 + T cells expressing IFN-\u03b3 (Th1) and IL-17 (Th17) [84] . These CD4 + T cells also showed elevated expression of effector cytokines like granzyme b, IL-17, IL-22, and GM-CSF, demonstrating that IL-10 can dampen the activity of potentially pathogenic T cells in the virally infected CNS.",

Extracellular ATP, as mentioned, routinely serves as an inflammatory amplifier after injury and infection by binding to purinergic receptors [26, 27] . Inflammatory responses are usually dampened as ATP is converted into adenosine by CD39 and CD79, which then binds to adenosine receptors (P1 receptors). Adenosine receptors are expressed by both CNS resident cells as well as peripheral innate and adaptive immune cells [86, 87] . [89] . Following CCI, it was revealed that A 2A R agonism was only neuroprotective at an early time point post-injury when glutamate levels were low [89] . Elevation of glutamate switched A 2A R signaling in microglia from anti-to pro-inflammatory. Collectively, these data showcase the complex biology of adenosine receptor signaling in the injured CNS and indicate that the state of injury must be carefully considered before attempting to modulate immune activity through A 2A R.",

Moreover, it is also worth considering the dynamics of immune regulation after CNS infection and injury. As noted above, the consequence of modulating immunoregulatory molecules can change over time. An early benefit such as enhanced pathogen control or glutamate uptake can convert to intolerable immunopathology or neurotoxicity as inflammation progresses.

While it is clear that macrophages exhibit a spectrum of phenotypes in regards to function and cytokine production, there is increasing evidence to indicate that the conversion of initially pro-inflammatory microglia/macrophages to an antiinflammatory state is beneficial in a variety of CNS injury models [91] . Phagocytosis of myelin by microglia/macrophages in vitro promotes a more anti-inflammatory state that can be inhibited by TNF-\u03b1 [62] . Following SCI, myeloid cells accumulate iron due in part to the phagocytosis of red blood cells resulting from vascular damage. Iron accumulation increases TNF-\u03b1 production and contributes to the maintenance of pro-inflammatory microglia/ macrophages [62] . Treatment of mice with iron-conjugated dextran promoted the maintenance of pro-inflammatory cells and impeded functional recovery following SCI [62] .

Molecules that promote immune cell trafficking (e.g. ICAM1, CXCL9, CXCL10) were expressed at reduced levels on CP epithelium from na\u00efve and injured IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 mice [92] . This in turn decreased the recruitment of T cells and monocytes to the lesion site following SCI and reduced functional recovery. IFN-\u03b3-producing CD4 + T cells can promote activation of the CP following SCI and help recruit monocytes to the lesion [93] . In fact, a delicate balance between effector CD4 + T cells and Foxp3 + Treg cells was found to be necessary for proper tissue repair in the injured spinal cord [93] . Depletion of Treg cells in the acute phase of SCI favored early effector CD4 + T cell recruitment and better functional recovery, whereas removal of Treg cells during the chronic phase (6 days after injury) promoted lingering effector CD4 + T cells and worse functional recovery. The pro-repair properties of CD4 + T cells after spinal cord and optic nerve injury were recently found to be IL-4-mediated and independent of MHC-II recognition [94] . Interestingly, CD4 + T cells promoted neuronal survival and better functional recovery even when transferred into MHC II \u2212/\u2212 mice, demonstrating that T cells do not need to interact with cognate-peptide MHC II complexes to benefit the injured CNS [94] . The IL-4 released by CD4 + T cells following injury enhanced neurotrophin signaling in neurons and promoted axonal growth. The mechanism by which CD4 + T cells become activated and secrete IL-4 after CNS injury is currently unknown, although it is postulated that the T cells sense damage signals released by injured neurons [94] . This neuroprotective function of T cells is in stark contrast to the severe immunopathology induced by autoreactive CD4 + T cells that traffic to the CNS during the development of diseases like experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis [95] .",

Once inflammation subsides, axons must be remyelinated in order to ameliorate neurological deficits. Infection of mice with neurotropic MHV results in viral persistence and spinal cord demyelination initiated by both CD8 + and CD4 + T cells [96] . Repair of these demyelinated lesions is mediated by neural precursor cells (NPCs) that differentiate into oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and, ultimately, mature myelinating oligodendrocytes [97] . Migration and maturation of OPCs following virusinduced demyelination is regulated primarily via CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling. CXCL12 is upregulated in demyelinated areas and OPCs express the CXCR4 chemokine receptor [98] . The major source of CXCL12 production in this model was found to be activated astrocytes [99] . Disruption of this pathway can impede remyelination and functional recovery following MHV infection [98] . These experiments demonstrate the importance of resident glial cells in carrying out CNS regeneration after inflammation subsides.",

            "text": "Regardless of how the CNS is damaged (either by infection or sterile injury), the rebuilding process requires a dampening of pro-inflammatory signals. During pathogen clearance, antiinflammatory pathways must engage early to preserve CNS tissue from potentially damaging cytopathic effector mechanisms. However, these anti-inflammatory mechanisms are not always fully effective, which results in CNS damage that must be repaired or contained. Regardless of the insult, sustained pro-inflammatory signals can impede the repair process. As discussed, quenching these signals is achieved by many different pathways and cell types. A hallmark feature of reparative immune programs is a shift from tissue defense to wound-healing. Sometimes wound-healing involves cleanup and rebuilding of tissue architecture, but in other cases a scar must be constructed to wall off a heavily damaged area. The scar itself can engage anti-inflammatory pathways, which is often viewed as beneficial. However, scars can also create physical barriers that prevent the rebuilding of new CNS connections or the infiltration of wound-healing immune cells into a site of tissue damage. More knowledge is required about the complexities of neural-immune interactions in the context CNS repair and how best to guide these interactions to promote maximal tissue recovery.",

            "text": "The CNS houses all of the machinery necessary to properly survey its unique environment and quickly respond to various detrimental stimuli, including viruses, bacteria, parasites, and sterile tissue damage. While peripheral cells are able to migrate to damaged areas and aid in clearing pathogens and cellular debris, regulation of these inflammatory responses is the key to preventing further damage. More research into the mechanisms of immune regulation is necessary to understand the distinct roles pro-and anti-inflammatory factors play in dealing with CNS insults while minimizing tissue damage. An intriguing discrepancy between infectious and sterile responses that warrants further investigation is the role of CD4 + T cells. The specific signals driving these helper T cells into either pathogenic or beneficial roles remain unclear. It is also unclear precisely how the functional states of CNS myeloid cells are established by various CNS perturbations. Myeloid cells like microglia and macrophages possess a remarkable degree of plasticity and can morph to suit the needs of their environment. A case in point is the unique jellyfish and honeycomb morphologies assumed by microglia to support the damaged glia limitans following focal brain injury ( Figure 1, Movie 1) . There is still much to learn about the dynamic states of CNS myeloid cells and how they are functionally shaped over time by inflammatory cues in the injured vs. infected CNS. The body expects a lot of these cells, and sometimes they contribute to errant responses that enhance pathology instead of resolving it. Immune regulation is a critical aspect of all inflammatory responses, but especially those that take root in the CNS. Our knowledge of CNS immune regulation and repair has improved a great deal in recent years, but more research is required to understand the many faces of the immune system and how it is instructed by the CNS. The ultimate goal is to have enough knowledge about the neuralimmune interface in order to therapeutically promote favorable outcomes following CNS infection or injury.",

            "text": "There are four different types of adenosine receptor (A 1 , A 2A , A 2B , A 3 ), and studies indicate that modulation of A 2A receptor in particular has immunoregulatory effects following CNS injury. Paradoxically, both A 2A receptor (A 2A R) agonism and antagonism can reduce tissue damage and improve motor function following SCI[88]. When an A 2A R agonist or antagonist was injected directly into the injured spinal cord, only the antagonist was neuroprotective, suggesting that the beneficial effects of A 2A R agonism were mediated primarily on peripheral immune cells. A 2A R antagonism is thought to act locally by reducing neuronal excitoxicity in the injured CNS, which occurs when excess levels of glutamate over-stimulate neurons upon binding to NMDA receptors. This conclusion is supported by a bone marrow chimera study showing that the positive benefit of A 2A R agonism is abrogated by deletion of A 2A R from hematopoietic cells. Moreover, the beneficial effects of A 2A R agonism can shift over time based on glutamate levels",
