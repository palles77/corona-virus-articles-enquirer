[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] With additional observational evidence suggesting increased transmission among HCWs in pediatric emergency departments (EDs), the observations from this pandemic should trigger increased attention to limiting highly infectious outbreak transmission in health care settings, especially for those who care for children. 12 Most hospital preparedness plans for such highly infectious outbreaks rely on implementation of strict isolation measures and personal protective equipment (PPE) use. In June 2009 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) compiled a case series of HCWs in the United States infected with the 2009 H1N1 virus. 1 Of note, 13 (27%) of the 48 infections were acquired in health care settings, with the majority of settings reporting poor adherence with recommended usage of PPE. Unfortunately, the risk of insufficient PPE use by HCWs may increase during acute scenarios requiring emergent intervention such as cardiac or respiratory arrest.",

            "text": "Background: Previous experience with simulated pediatric cardiac arrests (that is, mock codes) suggests frequent deviation from American Heart Association (AHA) basic and advanced life support algorithms. During highly infectious outbreaks, acute resuscitation scenarios may also increase the risk of insufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) use by health care workers (HCWs). Simulation was used as an educational tool to measure adherence with PPE use and pediatric resuscitation guidelines during simulated cardiopulmonary arrests of 2009 influenza A patients. Methods: A retrospective, observational study was performed of 84 HCWs participating in 11 in situ simulations in June 2009. Assessment included (1) PPE adherence, (2) confidence in PPE use, (3) elapsed time to specific resuscitation maneuvers, and (4) deviation from AHA guidelines. Results: Observed adherence with PPE use was 61% for eye shields, 81% for filtering facepiece respirators or powered air-purifying respirators, and 87% for gown/gloves. Use of a \"gatekeeper\" to control access and facilitate donning of PPE was associated with 100% adherence with gown and respirator precautions and improved respirator adherence. All simulations showed deviation from pediatric basic life support protocols. The median time to bag-valve-mask ventilation improved from 4.3 to 2.7 minutes with a gatekeeper present. Rapid isolation carts appeared to improve access to necessary PPE. Confidence in PPE use improved from 64% to 85% after the mock code and structured debriefing. Conclusions: Large gaps exist in the use of PPE and selfprotective behaviors, as well as adherence to resuscitation guidelines, during simulated resuscitation events. Intervention opportunities include use of rapid isolation measures, use of gatekeepers, reinforcement of first responder roles, and further simulation training with PPE.",

During the 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, Abramson, Canzian, and Brunet found that use of simulated resuscitation initially indicated that 3.5 to 5.5 minutes were required to don full SARS PPE, thus delaying time to intervention. 14 This finding prompted subsequent protocol adaptations and training initiatives to improve time to intervention while minimizing risk of exposure. However, issues that may positively or negatively influence the interaction between rapidly managing acute patient deteriorations and the likelihood of HCWs protecting themselves with PPE are not fully understood.",

            "text": "At our own hospital, in May 2009, early in the course of the 2009 pandemic-local responders and the pediatric medical emergency team (PMET) were called to the bedside of a ward patient admitted with the presumed diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia who had developed severe hypoxemia and required intubation. The patient then required an additional procedure in the pediatric ICU to have a larger endotracheal tube placed. It was subsequently discovered that the patient had been 2009 H1N1-positive on a screening sample from admission. Thus, as a result of poor situational awareness and adherence with PPE guidelines, 27 staff in multiple settings required post-exposure antiviral prophylaxis. This episode prompted us to reflect on our policies regarding PPE use for PMET calls during the H1N1 outbreak and to use simulation as a tool to objectively evaluate this clinical problem. In this context, the study described in this article was conducted to investigate the use of in situ simulation as an evaluation and educational tool for emerging threats and to measure (1) PPE adherence of staff during simulated pediatric cardiopulmonary arrest for suspected 2009 H1N1 patients, (2) confidence in PPE use, (3) elapsed time to specific resuscitation maneuvers, and (4) deviation from AHA guidelines.",

Unfortunately, during the SARS outbreak, expanded PPE requirements were found to limit the ability of the first responder to enter the room rapidly during an acute event. 14 This delay effect, due to donning of PPE, was reproduced in a study of first responders which demonstrated improved time to intervention through use of modified gowns with pre-tied neck straps and front-tying waist straps. 24 During the SARS outbreak, the delay effect led to the proposal of a protocol for modified PPE requirements for the first responder until further HCWs in full PPE arrived. Subsequent study of ED staff during a simulated resuscitation scenario also demonstrated subjective impairment in assessment abilities and task performance when wearing enhanced PPE as compared to without PPE, although objective measure data, which did not include the time taken to don PPE, were similar. 25 Such subjective impairment, particularly in communication, was also reported by staff in our own study among those wearing PAPRs as Interestingly, in our study, the delay effect was largely absent, except for one simulation, because at the time of room entry, many staff actually wore PPE that was insufficient or improper as compared with our current guidelines for enhanced droplet precautions, despite transparent observation of PPE adherence (Appendix 1). In contrast to all other simulations, however, the delay effect was observed in the only simulation in which the first responders electively donned PAPRs before entry. In this setting, the first responders did not enter until 2 minutes, as compared with the median study entry of 0.3 minutes. Thus, although direct comparison of correct use of N95 respirator versus PAPR was not possible because of the low incidence of PAPR use and the observational nature of this study, the utility of any added benefit provided by PAPR usage must be weighed against significant delays and impairment in emergent care delivery.",

As stated, 75% of the staff wore N95 respirators and 84% reported previous fit testing; however, because of the anonymous nature of the survey, previous fit testing could not be correlated with observed appropriate PPE adherence or choice of respirator. One study has demonstrated that without previous fit testing, nearly 50% of providers are able to achieve an adequate seal but that without regular use, there is decay in the ability to achieve an adequate seal over time. 27 Although laboratory testing suggests variable, but clearly increased protection, with N95s as compared with surgical masks, the clinical translation of this finding was not observed in a non-inferiority trial of influenza transmission among HCWs. 28, 29 Such mixed findings have only fueled unresolved questions as to the role of fit testing and the use of inappropriately donned respirators, particularly in emergency situations under pandemic circumstances.

Restricting nonessential or nonprotected providers during highrisk procedures remains a key strategy to reduce exposure. As such, a more experienced clinician or support staff may best fill this role. Our study suggests that a gatekeeper may improve respirator adherence, and likely gown and eye protection as well. During debriefing, participants stated that after they were aware that the patient was in distress, their priority was to provide rapid care despite knowing the patient was on enhanced precautions. They believed that donning PPE would slow them down. In this study, integrating the gatekeeper role served to protect more providers, with no adverse impact on resuscitation performance. For five of the key measures analyzed, participants for whom room access was controlled by a gatekeeper performed maneuvers on as timely a basis as their counterparts but with markedly better personal protection. Surprisingly, time to providing necessary ventilation support was 1.6 minutes earlier for gatekeepercontrolled groups. This suggests that incorporating the gatekeeper role into a code-response protocol during pandemic influenza or other suspected airborne contagions will not prolong time to critical care provision but perhaps improve it. The gatekeeper effect is likely driven by greater (1) situational awareness resulting from minimal direct patient care responsibilities, (2) familiarity with requisite precautions, and (3) knowledge of strategies for rapid staging, distribution, and donning of PPE. This effect may mitigate the delay effect while ensuring consistent and proper use of PPE, thereby minimizing delayed entry and maximizing opportunities for early resuscitation intervention as well as HCW safety.",
