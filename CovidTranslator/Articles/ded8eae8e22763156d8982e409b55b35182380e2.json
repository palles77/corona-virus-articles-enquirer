Twenty-five percent (15/60) of the dogs were positive for Leishmania by blood PCR, 12% by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and 22% by kDNA PCR. Of the cats, 16% (11/67) were positive by kDNA PCR and none by ITS1 HRM PCR. All the PCR-positive animals were infected by L. infantum verified by DNA sequencing and there was no significant difference between the PCR-positivity in the dog and cat populations. Altogether, 43% (26/60) of the dogs and 79% (53/67) of the cats were positive by serology or PCR for L. infantum. The average Leishmania parasite load in the blood of PCR-positive dogs (42,967 parasites/ml) was significantly higher than in PCR-positive cats (1259 parasites/ml) (t (12) = 2.33, P = 0.037). Dogs that were positive by the Leishmania ITS1 HRM PCR and kDNA PCR had significantly higher parasite loads than dogs positive only by the kDNA PCR (t (11) = \u2212 3.186580, P < 0.009). No significant effect was found for FIV seropositivity on Leishmania infection in the cats (\u03c7 2 = 0.506, P = 0.777). A higher percentage of Leishmania-positive dogs showed clinical signs compatible with leishmaniosis compared to Leishmania-positive cats (100 vs 52.8%, \u03c7 2 =15.242, P < 0.0001).

The plates were then washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in 50 mM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.2. Cat sera were then incubated with rabbit anti cat IgG antigen conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution; OriGene Technologies, Inc. Rockville, MD, USA) whereas dog sera were incubated with Protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000 dilution; Zymed Laboratories, Inc., San Francisco, CA, USA) for 1 hr at 37 \u00b0C. Excess conjugate was removed by extensive washing in PBS-Tween and the plates were developed by addition of the substrate 2,29-azino-di-3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate (ABTS) (Sigma-Aldrich-Merck, Jerusalem, Israel). Each plate was read when the absorbance (lambda = 405 nm) of the positive reference serum reached an optical density (OD) value between 1.1-1.2 for cat samples and 1.2-1.4 for dog samples. A titration of positive and negative reference cat or dog sera were included on each plate to monitor inter-assay variation. A serological cut-off of 0.4 OD for cats and for dogs was calculated based on four standard deviations above the mean OD values of readings from eight control sera of PCR-negative cats and dogs, respectively, from nonendemic areas for leishmaniosis. Borderline positive levels were considered antibody levels that were in the range between the three and four standard deviations which were 0.2-0.4 OD for dogs and 0.3-0.4 for cats.",

Additional detection and identification was carried out by PCR using primers ITS-219F and ITS-219R to amplify a 265-bp fragment of the Leishmania ribosomal operon internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region and then evaluated by high resolution melt (HRM) analysis (Leishmnia ITS1 HRM PCR) [6] . PCR was performed using the StepO-nePlus real-time PCR thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) as previously described [7] . DNA extracted from parasite promastigote culture of L. infantum was used as positive control for PCR and DNA from colony-bred dogs negative by PCR for vector-borne pathogens including L. infantum was used as a negative control. A non-template control (NTC) with the same reagents described above but without DNA was added to each PCR to rule out contamination.",

The openings were parallel to the ground and ~ 10 cm above it and the fan was adjusted to create updraft airflow with the collection boxes hanging above the body of the trap. The catch was chilled and kept at \u2212 20 \u00b0C until sorting. All sand fly males were identified to the species level by the morphology of the genitalia using the keys of Abonnec & Lewis [8, 9] . The females were not identified to the species level and pooled in groups of 20 specimens for molecular detection of Leishmania DNA. All samples were stored at \u2212 20 \u00b0C until testing.

This is opposite from the situation in the Aeolian islands study where 25.7% of the cats and 34.6% of the dogs surveyed were positive by the indirect immunofluorescence test (IFAT) [11] . The ratio between cat and dog seroreactivity was even lower in the Lisbon metropolitan area study where only one cat of 76 was seropositive by IFAT whereas 20.4% of the dogs were seropositive, and the authors of the study suggested that the serological test which they used may not have been sufficiently sensitive for detection of anti-leishmanial antibodies in cats [10] . The reason for the high seroprevalence rate in the shelter cats from Israel may have been due to the extensive close contact of these cats with infected dogs harboring a high parasite load in the presence of abundant sand fly vectors in a small compound. It may have also been related to their close association with many other infected cats under these conditions. The finding that L. infantum PCR-positive dogs had significantly higher parasite loads compared to PCR-positive cats exposed to infection under the same conditions agrees with the possibility that dogs may be better reservoirs and spreaders of L. infantum compared to cats. The parasite load in the blood and skin of dogs naturally infected with L. infantum has been found to be correlated with their capacity to infect sand fly vectors [13] . Although cats have been shown experimentally to infect sand flies by xenodiagnosis [14, 15] , the relationship between their parasite loads and infectiousness to sand flies has not been studied, and it is unknown how successful they are as spreaders of L. infantum under natural conditions.",

FIV serology was positive in 7% of the cats and no statistically significant association was found between FIV and L. infantum infections. Some other studies on large numbers of cats in Italy and Brazil have found an association between feline leishmaniosis and FIV [17, 18] whereas studies from Spain and Cyprus failed to find such an association [19, 20] . It is likely that an association between FIV and L. infantum infection was not found in the present study due to the small number of FIV-positive cats detected in the shelter and the overall limited feline population size evaluated.",

Furthermore, except for FIV serology, no other tests for additional infectious agents were performed. Most of the dogs (88%) and cats (55%) in the shelter had physical examination findings that were compatible with leishmaniosis and eventually after testing for the infection using specific tests, it was shown that indeed a significantly higher percentage of the dogs that were Leishmania-positive by serology or PCR had clinical signs of the disease when compared to their feline counterparts. This is reasonable when relating to the dog as the main host of the disease which often develops clinical disease after exposure to infection while the cat appears to be less frequently affected clinically by L. infantum with a much smaller number of clinical cases documented in the veterinary literature [2, 3] . To our knowledge, this is the first report of feline leishmaniosis in Israel. Israel is endemic for three species of Leishmania, L. tropica and L. major, which cause cutaneous leishmaniasis in humans, and L. infantum which causes visceral leishmaniasis [22] . Although L. major and L. tropica have been shown to cause disease in rare cases of dogs in Israel [23] [24] [25] , and both of these species have been reported to infect cats apparently asymptomatically in Turkey [26, 27] , infection in the animal shelter was shown to be caused by L. infantum by DNA sequencing of the PCR products.",

While the second most abundant sand fly species found in the shelter area, P. papatasi is a vector of L. major in Israel, but not of L. infantum [22] , the third species P. tobbi found only in small numbers is a vector of L. infantum [29] . The lack of positive detection of L. infantum in the females is reasonable in a collection conducted eight weeks after the removal of the infected animals from the area, and low infection rates of L. infantum in sand flies in general [30, 31] .",
