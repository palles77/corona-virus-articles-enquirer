            "text": "T he major challenge in regard to influenza surveillance and management is the propensity of the influenza virus to mutate, altering its immunogenic properties thereby allowing it to evade immune recognition and cause disease. Influenza A is classified according to the specific combination of its two surface molecules, hemagglutinin (HA) (H1 -H17) and neuraminidase (NA) (N1 -N9) isotypes 1-3 and its diversity is attributed by two mechanisms: genetic mutation or by gene reassortment 4, 5 . Typically genetic mutation is responsible for seasonal influenza outbreaks and the emergence of influenza pandemics is a consequence of gene reassortment among different strains and subtypes [4] [5] [6] . Since the extensively documented influenza pandemic in 1918-20, there have been a total of five influenza pandemics that have resulted in millions of deaths worldwide, where the fatality rate has reached more than 2.5% as in the case of 1918 pandemic 5, 7 . In 1957, H2N2 surfaced and replaced H1N1 in the human population until 1977 when H1N1 resurfaced, leading to co-circulation of the 2 influenza subtypes. Compared to H3N2 8 , the H1N1 subtype is believed to have a lower rate of antigenic drift which is associated with a smaller amount of mutations leading to amino acid changes 9 . Importantly the evolutionary behaviours of H1N1 and H3N2 are divergent leading to a dynamic and ever changing influenza climate in the human population where one virus subtype typically dominates over the other 8, 9 . Throughout the 100 year history of H1N1, the specific clinical parameters and immunogenic response to the genetic drift of H1N1 remains to be clarified.",

In 1947 a significant antigenic change transpired in the H1N1 virus creating strain distinct from previous 1943 viruses 13 . The new H1N1 virus termed ''A-Prime'' was relatively mild although widespread (a pseudopandemic) and hypothesized to be a reassortant from two distinct H1N1 strains 9, 13, 14 . An unusual H1N1 virus emerged in 1951 that was associated with severe disease: also thought to be a reassortant virus with genes from novel viruses and older H1N1 segments from the 1940's 9 . Succeeding a 20 year H1N1 disappearance, two H1N1 epidemics of interest came about, including the 1977 children's pandemic and a swine flu epidemic in 1976 that was feared to have pandemic potential and led to a massive public vaccination strategy 14 . The 1977 epidemic had limited infectivity to the immunologically na\u00efve younger population (persons ,25 years of age) which is thought to be due to the similar circulating H1N1 viruses of the 1950's 14 .",

Genomic analysis determined the virus was of swine origin and contained a triple reassortant of swine, human and avian influenza A genes 16 . Unlike previous contemporary seasonal influenza outbreaks, the 2009 H1N1pdm had age-related disparities in the frequency and severity of infection where the older age groups were less susceptible to the disease 17, 18 .

Anti-HA production is often associated with immunity to the same or homologous influenza strains and some antibodies have virus neutralizing ability blocking viral entry to the host cell 1, 19 . Importantly, previous exposure to influenza viruses influences how the body will respond to a subsequent influenza infection of the same or different genetic subtype 20 . To date, little is known about the immune and clinical response to H1N1 influenza viruses of the past 100 years and how the H1N1 subtype genetic drift and shift affected immune crossreactivity. Previously Nelson et al., conducted a large scale genetic analysis of 71 H1N1 sequences to determine the evolutionary history of this virus since 1918 9 . In our present study, we investigated the clinical characteristics and immune cross-reactivity of significant H1N1 influenza strains in the past 100 years in ferrets to determine the immunogenicity of important H1N1 viruses. We infected ferrets with historical H1N1 strains from 1943, 1947, 1977, 1986, 1999, and 2009 and monitored them for a 14-day time course to determine the clinical picture of each influenza strain infection and immune crossreactivity. Our findings clarify the influenza clinical picture of historical H1N1 strains and the help to elucidate the antigenic alterations of H1N1 that occurred in the past 100 years. The work here will facilitate the understanding of the immune response toward H1N1 and with future work may aid the development of future influenza therapeutics and anti-viral treatments.",

The ferret, Mustela putorius furo, is a superlative animal model for respiratory infections and the influenza ferret infectome has recently been published [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . Ferrets show respiratory illness similar to humans and clinical features of disease are easily observed where fevers can persist days following infection of viruses such as 2009 H1N1pdm influenza 21, 23, 30 . As well as fever, nasal discharge and sneezing can also be observed in animals infected with influenza viruses 21 These influenza A viruses were chosen due to their emergence and influence in H1N1 genetic history (Fig. 1 , strains used in this study are marked with an asterisks) as covered in the introduction. Following infection, ferrets were monitored for body temperature, weight, inactivity level, sneezing and nasal discharge from each group were observed daily until Day 14 post-infection (pI). Infection by all strains produced an increase in temperature; the normal range for ferret temperature is indicated by the shaded area of each graph 23 ( Supplementary Fig. S1a ). The pandemic H1N1 strain NY/09 induced the greatest fever on Day 2 to a temperature of 104% (of baseline). NCal/99 and Marton/43 infection also caused a high temperature of 103% from baseline, which peaked on Day 1 and Day 2 pI, respectively ( Table 1) . USSR/77 and Taiwan/86 had moderate fevers and FM/47 had the smallest increase in temperature reaching only 101% above baseline ( Table 1) .",

The 1918 pandemic strains and 2009 pandemic isolates each formed their own distinct cluster. The middle cluster contained 10 epidemic isolates. Within this cluster, FM/47 was closer to USSR/77 than Marton/43 which was more similar to PR/34. The 3 latest strains of seasonal H1N1, NCal/ 99, SI/06 and Bris/07, were positioned as a clade which was separated from the early stains by a long branch and clustal alignment of these three viruses ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ) showed several amino acid changes from NCal/99 and conserved between SI/06 and Bris/07: A3V, T99K, Y111H, K157E, V182A, R224K, W268R, T283N, and N489D. We calculated the protein homology by using the most variable region of the HA gene (HA135-295) which covers most of the viral surface and sequence change in this area has a strong impact in immunogenicity 36 . We found that 94% and higher homology scores led to HI cross-reactivity in all the cases. On the other hand, crossreactivity with lower homologies of 91-93% may or may not take place (Fig. 3b) . Taken together, our results suggested an important relationship and cross-reactivity between FM/47 and USSR/77 as well as the NCal/99, SI/06 and Bris/07 group that can be related to the genetic HA sequence. Further analysis of other influenza genes may also be important to the understanding of H1N1 evolution.",

Our analysis of the clinical course of Taiwan/86 infection in ferrets showed a moderate disease consisting of a mild biphasic temperature increase and minimal weight loss. These observations were in agreement with clinical disease reported during the 1986 naval base outbreak of influenza which there was no deaths but patients described fever, non-productive cough, sore throat and myalgia 38 . Furthermore, in accordance with our NY/09 data which had the most significant temperature fluctuations and weight loss, analysis by Shrestha and colleagues demonstrated that H1N1pdm was more severe than the previous circulating seasonal influenza viruses 39 . Evolutionary relationships among historical influenza H1N1 strains were conducted in MEGA5 using the Maximum Likelihood method and 500 bootstrap replications (a). Antibody cross-reactivity (determined by HI) among influenza strains is indicated by using the same colors. The numerical values displayed next to the branches indicate the percentage of bootstrap replicates in which the associated sequences clustered together. Hemagglutinin protein sequence homology among several influenza strains (b). Influenza strains were grouped according to the HI cross-reactivity observed in the serum from previously-infected ferrets (groups A through F). Alignments of protein sequences were performed using the highly variable HA135-295 region, which belongs to the HA-RBD area. The influenza virus was first identified in 1932 and since then the epidemiology and phylogentic analysis of subsequent influenza epidemics and pandemics have been extensively investigated 9, 14, 40 . Importantly, our results build on the previous investigations as we report the immunogenic evolution of the HA protein of significant pandemic and epidemic strains. The epidemic isolates examined by our phylogenetic analysis showed the 1918 and H1N1pdm 2009 strains to comprise each their own cluster and the seasonal strains ranging from 1934 to 2007 to cluster together. As expected by chronological analysis, our results showed Marton/43 to cross-react with its predecessor PR/34 which was in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis that placed the HA of Marton/43 close to PR/34 in the tree.",

Furthermore, they showed that the HA1 region of the 1947 HA was significantly different from the HA of the earlier 1940's strains 9 . In accordance with this analysis, our results showed that the FM/47 antisera did not inhibit hemagglutination with the earlier PR/34 and Marton/43 viruses and the Marton/ 43 antisera did not cross-react with the FM/47 virus. The inability for immunity induced by Marton/43 virus infection to target the FM/47 virus compliments the influenza vaccine performance in the human population of the 1940's as well as previously published studies 41 . Specifically, a related 1943 H1N1 virus strain (A/weiss/43), as well as A/PR/8/34 and B/Lee/40 were used in the influenza vaccine preparation which was completely ineffective during the '47 influenza outbreak 14, 41 . Although FM/47 antisera did not recognize the earlier H1N1 strains, it did cross-react with the HA molecule of the USSR/77 virus as did the USSR/77 antisera with the FM/47 virus. In support of these findings, the 1977 epidemic was thought to be the resurfacing of the FM/47 strain 9 . The USSR/77 outbreak was known as 'The Children's Pandemic' since only persons younger than 26 years old were affected 14 . During this time, older individuals were considered primed for the 1977 outbreak strain by previous infections from the 40's and 50's 37 which is supported by our immunological evidence. Together, our results, the phylogenetic analysis and the epidemiological records suggest the triggering of a unique immune response following infection with Marton/43 and FM/47 and a similar response from infection with the related strains FM/47 and USSR/77.",

Taiwan/86 was isolated from this outbreak and genomic analysis of its HA have suggested that the Taiwan/86 virus had evolved from viruses circulating in the early 1980's in Hong Kong 45 . Furthermore, it has also been suggested that this virus was the product of a reassortment event that had occurred between two H1N1 viruses 9 . Our results showed that the Taiwan/86 strain shared lower homology to 99, 06 and 07 viruses seen on our phylogenetic tree. The immunogenic findings showed antisera produced from ferret infection with Taiwan/86 was not able to inhibit hemagglutination with the other viruses on our virus panel, which compliments the literature describing the 1986 strain. The influenza vaccine in 1986 included the A/Chile/1/83 influenza strain 38 . Interestingly, during the 1986 US Naval Base outbreak, the soldiers who were vaccinated were poorly protected from infection with Taiwan/1986 38 . Furthermore, it was also shown that antibodies produced by vaccination with the A/Chile/1/83 vaccine preparation were not able to provide hemagglutination inhibition toward the newly arisen Taiwan/86 and Taiwan/86-like viruses 44 . From this evidence, it was then recommended that the Taiwan/86 strain be included in the subsequent influenza monovalent vaccine preparation 42, 44 . Our findings together with the previous reports on the Taiwan/86 outbreak suggest that the 1986 viruses were an antigenically unique group of strains that induced a specific immune response important when considering the evolution of H1N1 immunity.",

Our genetic analysis showed the three contemporary H1N1 seasonal viruses, NCal/99, Bris/07 and SI/06, to be proximal to each other on the phylogenetic tree with a long separation from the previous Taiwan/86 virus and in a distinct cluster from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses. Moreover, Bris/07 and SI/06 were closer to each other than they were to NCal/99. Interestingly, the antisera generated by infection with NCal/99 did not cross-react with the other two contemporary seasonal H1N1 viruses although the SI/06 and Bris/07 antisera recognized the NCal/09 virus. These results suggested there to be an amino acid change in Bris/07 and SI/06 from NCal/99 that may have resulted in a new antigenic site that was not originally present in NCal/99 strain. To investigate this contention we generated a clustal alignment of these viruses which showed numerous amino acid changes between Bris/07 and SI/06 sequences with NCal/99. These results may indicate the gradual yet still present drift of the H1N1 virus in this time period. As well, the immunogenic evolution seen in our analysis may question the consistent usage of the NCal/99 virus in influenza vaccine preparations from 2000-2001 to 2006-2007 9,47 .",

The HA from newly emerged H1N1 virus was identified to be similar to the HA of viruses isolated from North American swine which had recent and historical precedence 48 . This virus was designated 2009 H1N1 pandemic (H1N1pdm) and was shown to be a triple reassortant virus containing genes from swine, human and avian influenza A viruses 16 . In our phylogenetic analysis it was clearly evident that the triple reassortant viruses clustered far from the previously circulating seasonal H1N1 viruses in agreement with similar alignments. Furthermore, HI assays performed using ferret antisera produced raised against the NY/09 H1N1pdm antisera was not able to recognize the HA of any other viruses. These results are supported by previous published findings that determined the cross-protection initiated following infection with H1N1pdm which was preceded by infection with contemporary seasonal H1N1 did not occur through an HA targeted antibody response 20 . Interestingly, although an H1N1 component had been included in the seasonal influenza vaccine preparations since 1977 49 , antigen directed pre-existing immunity to 2009 H1N1pdm was only detected in the elderly suggesting the majority of the current human population was na\u00efve to the this novel virus 50, 51 . Cross-reactive antibodies found in the elderly population suggested that protective immunity was induced from exposure to an older H1N1 virus with antigenic similarities to 2009 H1N1pdm 25,50-52 . Our study directly tested the ability of infection with older H1N1 strains from the years 1943 to 1947 to bind the HA molecule of the 2009 H1N1pdm virus. Against current hypotheses, we found that the immune production of antisera from infection with viruses originating from the 1940's were not able to recognize the HA of the novel pandemic viruses. Likewise, the H1N1pdm antisera did not detect the panel of viruses ranging from 1934 to 2007. Recently, the effect of priming ferrets with historical H1N1 viruses on the immune response of secondary infection the H1N1pdm was described 53, 54 . These studies addressed distinct immunological questions as our study utilizing a different set of H1N1 viruses. These priming studies complimented our study as the historical H1N1 strains used were not the same as ours. The purpose of the previous studies was to determine protection from priming infection/infections whereas we queried immune detection, cross-reactivity and clinical analysis. Importantly, a significant issue that remains is the affect of age on the outcome of infection/ www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 1698 | DOI: 10.1038/srep01698 sequential infection with the historical and contemporary viruses. Historical accounts mention clinical pathology among age groups but do not have a comprehensive analysis of the comparative severity 14, 38, 49, 55 . As well, it is not know how the aging immune system responds to the evolving influenza virus. Although a protective response was seen in priming studies in adult animals, it is not know if protection of the same magnitude would remain during age related immunosenescence or if the clinical response in the aged would be similar as we have shown in this study.",

These evolutionary behaviours are divergent leading to a dynamic and ever changing influenza climate in the human population where one Influenza A subtype typically dominates over the other. Importantly, understanding the interplay between the H1N1 and H3N2 infection evolution remains a significant hurdle in influenza reasearch 8, 9 . Nelson and colleagues investigated the genetic evolution of the H1N1 virus by analyzing the evolution of the whole virus as well as the individual viral segments from strains since 1918 9 . In this study the authors were able to identify instances where divergent clades co-circulated as well as events of intra-H1N1 subtype reassortment 9 . Previously, Smith and colleagues compared the antigenic and genetic evolution of the H3N2 virus from strains originating in 1968 to 2003 and found that antigenic and genetic evolution showed differing patterns 8 . Antigenic evolution was punctuated where the strains formed clusters and genetic change was more even and gradual as time increased 8 . Here we sought to elucidate the antigenic evolution of the H1N1 virus. As with the H3N2 virus 8 , we found the antigenic change did not vary evenly by year but instead corresponded to genetic changes in the HA molecule. These studies are significant for elucidating the intricacies of influenza evolution as the continuous change of the influenza virus is the greatest challenge to the management of disease and containment of further outbreaks. A better understanding of the evolution of the influenza virus and the interplay between the H3N2 and H1N1 strains will improve the design of prophylactics such as by guiding vaccine strain selection for yearly trivalent influenza vaccine or may even give insight to the development of a universal influenza vaccine.

            "text": "Animal models remain the most appropriate mode for the methodical scientific investigation of human influenza virus pathogenesis and the testing of influenza prophylactics and therapeutics. Currently, the ferret is thought to be the most suitable animal model for respiratory influenza virus infection 56 since ferrets are physiologically susceptible to wild type influenza viruses due to a similar respiratory tract and are able to transmit the virus once infected. As mentioned previously, ferrets display similar clinical disease as humans following influenza infection which include fever, weight loss, and sneezing and these positive features have been well discussed previously 21, 24, 26, 30, 56 . As well, the ferret has been shown to have similar features as human in regard to IFN pathway function and is potential model for the study of human IFN-gamma signalling 24, 57 . Although the ferret is an appropriate model, it is imperative to be mindful of the disparities between animal models and the nature human infection to have an accurate assessment of research findings especially from ferret-influenza studies. During experimental influenza infections in animal models, a specific and known amount of virus is administered to the animal in a controlled manor, usually by intranasal inoculation. Modeling the infectious behaviour of a virus is more predictable when the infection route and dose are controlled. This is in contrast to natural infection where humans are infected with an unknown amount of virus in an unknown route, which must be considered when extrapolating results from animal model studies. Most significantly, ferrets as well as other animal models used in influenza studies are typically 'Specific Pathogen Free' (SPF). In this case, the ferrets are determined to be influenza free prior to study initiation. Unlike humans who have been previously exposed to various subtypes of influenza viruses, ferrets used in influenza studies are completely na\u00efve to the virus. The nuances of the immune response subsequent to multiple influenza infections, such as the phenomenon of original antigenic sin 58 , has only started to be elucidated in the ferret model 53 and much work is still required to have a full understanding of the effect of sequential influenza infection on the specific immune response mounted. Furthermore, since the influenza virus is subject to both genetic shift and genetic drift 35 , the clinical manifestations of sequential virus infections by a virus that undergone multiple genetic drifts would differ from a response of a virus that had undergone a significant genetic shift as that of the H1N1 2009 pandemic variant.",

The University Health Network (UHN) has certification with the Animals for Research Act (Permit Number: #0045 and #0085 of the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs) and follows NIH guidelines (OLAW #A5408-01). The animal use protocol was approved by the Animal Care Committee (ACC) of the UHN. Infections and subsequent sample collection were performed under 5% isofluorane anesthesia in an effort to minimize suffering. Infection and ferret monitoring. Maintenance and monitoring of infected ferrets has been previously described 23 . Briefly, male ferrets 4-6 months old were bred in an on-site SPF ferret colony (University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada). Prior to infection, all ferrets were screened for influenza and shown to be seronegative by HI assay against circulating influenza A and B strains (2010-2011 WHO Influenza Reagent Kit for Identification of Influenza Isolates (WHO collaborating center for surveillance, epidemiology and control for influenza infection division)). The kits contain the circulating influenza strains for the particular year. Prior to infection, ferrets were randomly selected and pair-housed in cages contained in bioclean portable laminar-flow clean-room enclosures (Lab Products, Seaford, DE) in the BSL-2 animal holding area. Baseline body temperature and weight were measured on Day 0 for each animal. Temperatures were measured by using a subcutaneous implantable temperature transponder (BioMedic Data Systems, Inc., Seaford, DE). Upon infection, ferrets were anesthetized and infected 1mL of virus preparation for each ferret (0.5mL in each nostril). Ferrets were infected with Marton/43 (N 5 12), FM/47 (N 5 10), USSR/77 (N 5 12), Taiwan/86 (N 5 10), NCal/99 (N 5 14) , and NY/09 (N 5 12). All viruses were used at 10 5 EID 50 except for FM/47 which was infected at 10 6 EID 50 since it was reported to be a milder virus 14 . Clinical signs (body temperature, body weight, level of activity, nasal discharge, and sneezing) were observed daily for 14 days pI. We examined animals at the same time each day for consistency. Nasal discharge includes crusty nose, mucous, and transparent exudates/ fluids. The scores were calculated from the total animals displaying any nasal discharge symptom over the total number of animals. The sneezing scores were calculated from the total animals found sneezing over the total number of animals. Scores were calculated daily for 14 days and only the peak values for each infection are www.nature.com/scientificreports SCIENTIFIC REPORTS | 3 : 1698 | DOI: 10.1038/srep01698 summarized. The inactivity scoring system is based on the reference Reuman et al., 1989 59 to assess the inactivity level: 0, alert and playful; 0.5, alert but playful only when stimulated; 1, alert but not playful when stimulated; 2, neither alert nor playful when stimulated. A relative inactivity index was calculated as follows: S (day 1 to day 14) [score11] n /S (day 1 to day 14) n, where n equals the total number of observations. A value of 1 was added to each observation unit score so that a score of 0 could be divided by a denominator, resulting in an index value of 1.0 as the minimum value.",
