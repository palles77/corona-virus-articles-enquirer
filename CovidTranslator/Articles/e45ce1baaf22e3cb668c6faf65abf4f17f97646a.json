Chronic diarrheal conditions persist for at least 4 weeks and, more typically, 6 to 8 weeks or longer. There are four mechanisms of diarrhea: osmotic, secretory, exudative, and altered motility. Because many diarrheal diseases are due to more than one of these mechanisms, it is clinically useful to categorize diarrhea as malabsorptive (fatty), watery, and inflammatory.",

            "text": "To understand the osmotic, secretory, and inflammatory mechanisms of diarrhea, it is necessary to understand how the normal intestine handles fluid and solutes in health and disease. Whether a hypotonic meal, such as a steak and water, or a hypertonic meal, such as milk and a doughnut, is consumed, the volume of the meal is augmented by gastric, pancreatic, biliary, and duodenal secretions. The permeable duodenum then renders the meal approximately isotonic with an electrolyte content similar to that of plasma by the time it reaches the proximal jejunum. As the intestinal slurry moves toward the colon, the Na + concentration in the luminal fluid remains constant, but Cl \u2212 is reduced to 60 to 70 mmol/L, and bicarbonate (HCO 3 \u2212 ) is increased to a similar concentration as the result of Cl \u2212 and HCO 3 \u2212 transport mechanisms in the enterocyte and HCO 3 \u2212 secretion in the ileum (Fig. 142 -1B and C). In the colon, K ++ is secreted, and the Na + transport mechanism of the colonocyte, together with the low epithelial permeability, extracts Na + and fluid from the stool. As a result, the Na + content of stool decreases to 30 to 40 mmol/L; K ++ increases from 5 to 10 mmol/L in the small bowel to 75 to 90 mmol/L; and poorly absorbed divalent cations, such as Mg 2++ and Ca 2++ , are concentrated in stool to values of 5 to 100 mmol/L. The anion concentrations in the colon change drastically because bacterial degradation of carbohydrate (i.e., unabsorbed starches, sugars, and fiber) creates short-chain fatty acids that attain concentrations of 80 to 180 mmol/L; at colonic pH, organic anions, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are present. In the setting of carbohydrate malabsorption, the generation of high concentrations of these short-chain fatty acids may decrease stool pH to 4 or lower. The osmolality of the stool is approximately that of plasma (280 to 300 mOsm/kg H 2 O) when it is passed.",

The small intestine normally absorbs 8 to 9 L (80%) of this fluid and presents 1.5 L to the colon for absorption. Of the remaining fluid, the colon absorbs all but approximately 100 mL. Diarrhea can result from increased secretion by the small intestine or the colon if the maximal daily absorptive capacity of the colon (4 L) is exceeded.

Oral rehydration solutions, which are used extensively to replace diarrheal fluid and electrolyte losses, are effective because they contain sodium, sugars, and, often, amino acids that use nutrient-dependent sodium uptake transporters. In alert patients with mild to moderate dehydration, oral rehydration solution is equally effective as intravenous hydration in repairing fluid and electrolyte losses. Oral rehydration solutions can be given to infants and children in volumes of 50 to 100 mL/kg over 4 to 6 hours; adults may need to drink 1000 mL/hr. Reduced-osmolarity solutions (Na ++ 75 mmol/L, osmolarity 245 mmol/L versus Na ++ 90 mmol/L, osmolarity 311 mmol/L in standard solutions) are better tolerated and effective in noncholera diarrhea but may cause hyponatremia in patients with high-volume diarrhea, particularly children. Glucose-based solutions, although effective in rehydrating the patient, may worsen the diarrhea. In contrast to glucose-based solutions, polymeric TREATMENT DIAGNOSIS Acute watery diarrhea may be due to infections, food toxins, or medications, or the acute diarrhea may signal the onset of a chronic disease ( Fig. 142-2 ; see Tables 142-1 and 142-2) (Chapters 310 through 320, 344, 345, 359, 360, 364, 365, 387, and 388). The diagnostic approach in patients with fever and watery or bloody diarrhea should focus on stool cultures for Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella species. Routine stool culture is not indicated when diarrhea occurs after 3 to 5 days of hospitalization, except in patients with neutropenia, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or signs of enteric infection. In patients with a history of recent antibiotic use, hospitalization, or peripartum, stools for C. difficile toxin should be obtained. Organisms that cause diarrhea but are not routinely tested by clinical microbiology laboratories include Yersinia, Plesiomonas, enterohemorrhagic E. coli serotype O157:H7, Aeromonas, Cyclospora, microsporidia, and noncholera Vibrio. Parasites such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides can be difficult to detect in stool but may be diagnosed by stool antigen testing or intestinal biopsy.

Anaerobic bacteria cause impaired micelle formation by releasing cholylamidases, which deconjugate bile salts. The unconjugated bile salts, with their higher pK a , are more likely to be in the protonated form at the normal upper small intestinal pH of 6 to 7 and can be absorbed passively.

Anaerobic bacteria ingest vitamin B 12 and release proteases that degrade brush-border disaccharidases. Although anaerobic bacteria use vitamin B 12 , they synthesize folate.

In an adult, if less than 100 cm of ileum is diseased or resected, watery diarrhea results because of stimulation of colonic fluid secretion by unabsorbed bile salts. Bile acid diarrhea responds to cholestyramine (2 to 4 g taken at breakfast, lunch, and dinner). If more than 100 cm of ileum is diseased or resected, bile salt losses (>3 g/day) in the colon exceed the capacity for increased bile salt synthesis in the liver, the bile salt pool shrinks, and micelle formation is impaired. As a result, steatorrhea ensues, and fatty acid-induced intestinal secretion synergizes with the bile acid-induced secretion to cause diarrhea. Treatment is with a low-fat diet, vitamin B 12 (300 to 1000 \u00b5g subcutaneously once every month or 2 mg orally once a day), dietary supplements of calcium (500 mg orally two to three times a day, monitor 24-hour urine calcium for adequacy of dose), and a multiple vitamin and mineral supplement.

Renal oxalate stones sometimes can be avoided with a low-fat, low-oxalate diet and calcium supplements. Bone disease is caused by impaired micelle formation with a resulting decrease in absorption of vitamin D; year-round sun exposure reduces this complication. Vitamin D (50,000 U orally one to three times a week) and calcium supplements (500 mg orally two to three times a day) should be given to susceptible individuals, but vitamin D levels and serum and urinary calcium must be monitored for response to treatment because excess vitamin D can be toxic.

This inability may be caused by a lack of intrinsic factor, consumption of cobalamin by overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria in the small bowel lumen, ileal disease or resection, or defective transcobalamin II. Large amounts of cobalamin are present in the liver (2 to 5 mg), and cobalamin is reabsorbed from bile through the enterohepatic circulation, thereby limiting daily losses to less than 1 \u00b5g.

Occasionally, individuals present with ocular or neurologic disease without gastrointestinal symptoms. Men are affected more commonly than women, particularly white men.

Treatment is with a prolonged course of broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g., 10 to 14 days of parenteral penicillin G, 1.2 million U every day and streptomycin, 1 g every day; ceftriaxone, 2 g intravenously daily, or meropenem, 1 g intravenously three times daily; then, 160 mg of trimethoprim and 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole orally two times a day for 1 year or 160 mg of trimethoprim and 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole orally two times a day for 1 year). Relapses occur, but initial treatment with parenteral ceftriaxone or meropenem appears to be associated with a low relapse rate.",

Immediately after transplantation, diarrhea is caused by the toxic effects of cytoreductive therapy on the intestinal epithelium. Twenty to 100 days after transplantation, diarrhea is usually due to graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or infection. Patients with GVHD present clinically with a skin rash, hepatic cholestasis, buccal mucositis, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. The diagnosis of GVHD in the gastrointestinal tract can be made on biopsy of the stomach, small intestine, or colon. In mild cases, the mucosa appears normal on inspection at endoscopy, but apoptosis of gastric gland or crypt cells can be found on biopsy. In severe cases, denudation of the intestinal epithelium results in diarrhea and malabsorption and often requires parenteral nutritional support. Octreotide (50 to 250 \u00b5g subcutaneously three times a day) may be helpful in controlling voluminous diarrhea. Treatment of GVHD is with steroids and antithymocyte globulin combined with parenteral nutritional support until intestinal function returns.",

Limited jejunal resection usually is tolerated best because bile salt and vitamin B 12 absorption remain normal.

In comparison, individuals with fewer than 100 cm of jejunum and no colon have high jejunostomy outputs and often require intravenous fluids or parenteral nutrition to survive. These individuals waste sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, zinc, and water in their ostomy effluent. Dietary modifications should include a high-salt, nutrient-rich diet given in small meals. An oral rehydration solution with a sodium concentration greater than 90 mmol/L is absorbed best. Oral vitamin and mineral doses higher than the usual U.S. recommended daily allowances are required (Table 142- 5) . Vitamin B 12 should be given parenterally (500 to 1000 \u00b5g subcutaneously every month). Magnesium deficiencies are often difficult to replenish with oral magnesium because of its osmotic effect in the intestinal lumen. A liquid magnesium preparation added to an oral rehydration solution and sipped throughout the day may minimize magnesium-induced fluid losses. Potent antimotility agents, such as tincture of opium (0.5 to 1 mL orally four times a day), often are needed to slow transit and maximize contact time for nutrient absorption. High-volume jejunostomy outputs can be lessened by inhibiting endogenous secretions with a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole, 40 mg orally one to two times a day, or lansoprazole, 30 mg orally one to two times a day) and, in severe cases, octreotide (100 to 250 \u00b5g subcutaneously three times a day; if effective, convert to an equivalent long-acting monthly dosage).

Symptoms of abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting occur shortly after ingestion of the allergen (Chapter 261). The role of food allergy in causing diarrhea in adults is less clear owing to the lack of a reliable diagnostic test. Allergy testing correlates poorly with intestinal allergy. The most common food allergens are milk, soy, eggs, seafood, nuts, and wheat. Sequential elimination diets can be diagnostic and therapeutic. ",

Symptoms can develop 20 years after treatment, however. Early abnormalities include an increase in inflammatory mediators, an increase in cholinergic stimulation of intestinal tissue, and endothelial cell apoptosis that precedes epithelial cell apoptosis. The last finding suggests that vascular injury is the primary event. Vascular endothelial growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and IL-11 protect animal intestine from experimental radiation damage. Diarrhea may be caused by bile acid malabsorption if the ileum is damaged, by bacterial overgrowth if radiation causes small intestinal strictures or bypass, or by radiation-induced chronic inflammation of the small intestine and colon.

Significant malabsorption of fat and carbohydrate usually causes chronic diarrhea, abdominal cramps, gas, bloating, and weight loss. Steatorrhea (fat in the stool) manifests as oily, foulsmelling stools that are difficult to flush down the toilet. Stools may be large and bulky (e.g., pancreatic insufficiency) or watery (e.g., bacterial overgrowth, mucosal diseases). Individuals with malabsorption also can present with manifestations of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Dyspnea can be caused by anemia from iron, folate, or vitamin B 12 deficiency. Manifestations of calcium, magnesium, or vitamin D malabsorption include paresthesias and tetany due to hypocalcemia or hypomagnesemia and bone pain due to osteomalacia or osteoporosis-related fractures. Paresthesias and ataxia are manifestations of cobalamin and vitamin E deficiency. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a blistering, burning, itchy rash on the extensor surfaces and buttocks that is associated with celiac disease. Inflammatory diarrheas may present with fever and abdominal pain or with edema to suggest chronic protein loss. Patients may have multiple, lowvolume, bloody stools with tenesmus to suggest proctitis, or have severe diarrhea due to GVHD or celiac disease. Systemic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease include polymigratory arthritis, sacroiliitis, erythema obtained. A stool test for fat on a high-fat diet (70 to 100 g/day) is the best available screening test for malabsorption (see Table 142 -6). If the fecal fat test result is negative, selective carbohydrate malabsorption or other causes of watery diarrhea should be considered. If the fecal fat test result is positive, further testing should be based on clinical suspicion for particular diseases. If pancreatic insufficiency is suspected, imaging studies of the pancreas should be performed. If proximal mucosal damage is suspected, multiple small intestinal biopsy specimens should be obtained. If there are no clues to the cause of malabsorption, a d-xylose test may help to distinguish mucosal disease from pancreatic insufficiency. However, the d-xylose test result also can be abnormal in individuals with bacterial overgrowth; if this condition is suspected, culture of an intestinal aspirate or a breath test should be obtained (see Table 142 -6). Small bowel contrast imaging is useful in detecting ileal disease and structural abnormalities that predispose to bacterial overgrowth (Table 142-7) . Some individuals with celiac disease present with selective nutrient deficiencies without diarrhea. In these cases, tTG antibody tests and intestinal biopsy should be performed. In patients hospitalized for severe diarrhea or malnutrition, a more streamlined evaluation usually includes a stool for culture, ova and parasites, and fat; an abdominal imaging study; and a biopsy of the small intestine and colon.",
