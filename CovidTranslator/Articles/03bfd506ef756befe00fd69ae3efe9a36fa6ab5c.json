            "text": "Background: Randomized trials have shown that optimal adherence to antihypertensive agents could protect against cardiovascular diseases, but whether adherence reduces cardiovascular deaths in community settings has not been explored so fully. This study evaluates the association between antihypertensive adherence and cardiovascular (coronary heart disease and stroke) mortality in the primary care settings. Methods: From a territory-wide database in Hong Kong, we included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents in the years between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and assigned as having poor (Proportion of Days Covered [PDC] b 40%), intermediate (40-79%), and high (\u226580%) adherence to antihypertensive agents. The association between antihypertensive adherence and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated by using the Cox proportional hazard models. Results: From a total of 218,047 eligible patients, 3825 patients (1.75%) died of cardiovascular disease within five years after having received their first-ever antihypertensive agents. The proportions of patients having poor, intermediate, and high medication adherence were 32.9%, 12.1%, and 55.0%, respectively. Higher adherence levels at PDC 40%-79% (HR = 0.46, 95% C.I. 0.41-0.52, p b 0.001) and \u2265 80% (HR = 0.91, 95% C.I. 0.85-0.98, p = 0.012) were significantly less likely to be associated with mortality than the poor adherence (PDC0.040) group. Conclusions: Better antihypertensive adherence was associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. This highlights the need to promote adherence through strategies which have been proved to be effective in clinical settings.",

In trial settings, reductions of blood pressure lowered the incidence of heart failure by 50%, stroke by 40-45%, and myocardial infarction by 20-25% [1, 2] . However, it is widely recognized that a large proportion of hypertensive patients do not take antihypertensive therapies as prescribed [3] , and persistence with prescriptions decreased with time especially in the first year of treatment [4] [5] [6] [7] . Higher morbidity rates, mortality, hospitalization rates and healthcare costs have been attributed to poor medication adherence [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

It shows that even among those who had not experienced any such events, maintenance of optimal antihypertensive adherence confers primary prevention to a substantial extent. An accompanying editorial by Chobanian [13] argued for the importance of investigating this in greater depth because suboptimal adherence is likely to be multi-factorial. One of the major determinants includes the patients' race and ethnicity, which in turn introduces cultural and attitudinal differences [14] .",

Most studies on the impact of antihypertensive compliance on health outcomes have been conducted on higher-risk individuals or have used a cardiovascular (CVS) event alone as an outcome measure [15] [16] [17] [18] .

It is the sole portal for information used in all public clinical settings. This allows linkage of information when patients visit clinics in different districts. All physician prescriptions were checked by dispensers or pharmacists using standardized procedures, and any amendments in the prescriptions were captured in the database. A previous evaluation which assessed this database reported that socio-demographic and prescription details were 100% and 99.8% complete, respectively [19] . The sampling frame for this study included the entire population of Hong Kong, which is more than 7,000,000 as of 2012. Hong Kong has three distinct regions; these are Hong Kong Island (most urbanized); Kowloon; and the New Territories (most rural). Ethics clearance was obtained from the Clinical Ethics Research Committee of the Hospital Authority, and the Surveys and Behavioral Research Ethics Committee of the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

We excluded patients who were prescribed any antihypertensive drugs before the index date, and treated patients who died due to conditions other than cardiovascular diseases within the observation period as being censored. We allocated each patient according to the initial prescription of antihypertensive drugs, namely, \u03b1-blockers, \u03b2-blockers, thiazide diuretics, calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs). Those prescribed angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and combination therapy were not included in our analysis as the number was relatively few. Concomitant comorbidities include cardiovascular risk factors and diseases which could potentially influence the choice of antihypertensive drug class, as indicated by the respective ICPC-2 or ICD-9 codes.

Among all deaths in Hong Kong, the vast majority occurred in hospitals, and this allows accurate case ascertainment [26] . Deaths in hospital have been utilized in previous studies as a valid measure of patient mortality, and it is usual in Chinese populations that death occurs in hospital [26] [27] [28] . The predictor variable in this study was the interval-based PDC, defined as the number of days when medication is supplied in a specified period divided by the total number of days within the period. Interval-based PDC is an internationally accepted metric for the assessment of medication adherence in large database analysis [29] [30] [31] . A PDC \u2265 80% indicates that the patient is medication-adherent [29, 30] . In this study we used a five-year interval for the estimation of PDC, or we used the time period between the index date and mortality if the subject died. We adopted an approach similar to Mazzaglia and colleagues [12] , namely, that of classifying drug adherence into three levels: high (PDC \u2265 80%); intermediate (PDC = 40-70%); or low (PDC b 40%) [18, 31] .",

In addition, because of the observational nature of the study, treatment indication bias might exist. Therefore, an additional analysis was conducted including adjustment of propensity scores in the Cox proportion hazard models in accordance with standard statistical methodology [32, 33] . Two propensity score models were developed to estimate weightings for adherence selection, namely high vs low and intermediate vs low adherence. The absence of multicollinearity was evaluated to ensure the robustness of the regression model. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16.0 was used for all data analyses.

            "text": "Corrao and colleagues utilized the health service databases of Lombardy, Italy, and followed up newly treated hypertensive patients for six years. They reported that compared to patients having PDC \u2264 25%, those with intermediate (PDC 51-75%), and high levels (PDC > 75%) of adherence had 20% and 25% of CVS risk reductions, respectively [34] . Many other studies demonstrating the positive relationship between medication compliance and clinical outcome also reflected the importance of maintaining optimal medication adherence [11, 12, [15] [16] [17] [18] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Our study differs from these studies in a number of respects, including the fact that they included different patient groups such as diabetics [16] , patients with pre-existing myocardial infarction [18] , or coronary heart disease [17] ; different medications under study like cardiovascular drugs other than antihypertensive agents [15] ; different clinical outcomes measured like cardiovascular events or heart failure instead of CVS mortality [12, 27, 33, 37, 38] , hospitalization risk or healthcare cost [11] ; and the use of self-reported data to measure adherence [36] . Furthermore, all of these studies were predominantly based on patients of Caucasian ethnicity, which group has a higher incidence of coronary heart disease and a lower risk of stroke than Chinese subjects. The prevalence of hypertension is rising rapidly in different urban and rural regions of China, and the adherence to antihypertensive medications among Chinese remains poor. For instance, recent studies found that the prevalence of hypertension in Southern China has increased to 25% in urbanized regions [41, 42] , and the rates of awareness, treatment and control are as low as 17.59%, 10.39%, and 3.42%, respectively, in rural regions of China [42] . The adherence rate to antihypertensive treatment was found to be 52% among elderly Chinese Americans, and this similarly poor adherence level was also observed in other Chinese populations [43] .",

We report a clear inverse relationship between medication adherence and CVS mortality in real-life clinical practice. The large sample size followed up for five years, and the comprehensive computerized systems with complete clinical information are among some of the study strengths. In addition, the good dispensation practice captured by the computer further enhanced the robustness of our study findings. Nevertheless, some limitations should be discussed. Firstly, there exists an inherent limitation in database analysis, namely, the assumption that patients were actually taking the medications prescribed. In addition, the healthcare system of Hong Kong consists both of a public and a private sector, and this study cannot capture data if patients visit clinical settings in the private marketalthough more than 90% of hypertensive patients were followed up in the public sector for medication refill. Also, we were able to study cardiovascular outcomes for only up to five years, and not all confounders could be controlled for in this study. There exists a possibility of residual confounding despite regression analysis, and the issue of treatment indication bias could still remain despite the introduction of propensity scores. It could be argued that those who adhered better to medications could also be sickerand hence at a significantly higher risk for cardiovascular diseases.",

It fills the knowledge gap in existing literature which has scarcely addressed this association in non-interventional settings. As a result, we have more concrete evidence to support more intensive counseling on medication adherence initiated by physicians and allied health professionals with hypertensive patients during clinical consultations. At a health-policy level, a greater need for community-based programs and strategies to enhance compliance is justified by these findings. Many innovative approaches to enhance medication adherence, including comprehensive, multimodal pharmacy care initiatives, have been demonstrated as being effective in improving drug adherence [45] . In addition, those at higher risks of medication nonadherence [25] , namely, younger patients, female subjects, people with lower socio-economic status, and patients without concomitant comorbidities should receive particular attention. Future research should focus on evaluating this association in other ethnic groups and in patients with different cardiovascular risks, as well as identifying patient subgroups where the impact of enhancing medication adherence is the strongest.",
