Despite intense research 26 effort, how, when and where novel diseases appear are still the source of considerable 27 uncertainly. A severe respiratory disease was recently reported in the city of Wuhan, 28 Hubei province, China. At the time of writing, at least 62 suspected cases have been 29 reported since the first patient was hospitalized on December 12 nd 2019. Epidemiological 30 investigation by the local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested 31 that the outbreak was associated with a sea food market in Wuhan. We studied seven 32 patients who were workers at the market, and collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 33 (BALF) from one patient who exhibited a severe respiratory syndrome including fever, 34 dizziness and cough, and who was admitted to Wuhan Central Hospital on December 35 26 th 2019. Next generation metagenomic RNA sequencing 4 identified a novel RNA virus 36 from the family Coronaviridae designed WH-Human-1 coronavirus (WHCV). 37 Phylogenetic analysis of the complete viral genome (29,903 nucleotides) revealed that 38 WHCV was most closely related (89.1% nucleotide similarity similarity) to a group of 39 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-like coronaviruses (genus Betacoronavirus, 40 subgenus Sarbecovirus) previously sampled from bats in China and that have a history 41 of genomic recombination. This outbreak highlights the ongoing capacity of viral spill-42 over from animals to cause severe disease in humans. 43 44 Seven patients, comprising five men and two women, were hospitalized at the Central 45 : bioRxiv preprint 3 patients was 43, ranging from 31 to 70 years old. The clinical characteristics of the patients 47 are shown in Table 1. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms. All patients had 48 fever with body temperatures ranging from 37.2 o C to 40 o C. Patients 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 had 49 cough, while patients 1, 2 and 7 presented with severe cough with phlegm at onset of illness. 50 Patients 4 and 5 also complained of chest tightness and dyspnea. Patients 1, 3, 4 and 6 51 experienced dizziness and patient 3 felt weakness. No neurological symptoms were observed 52 in any of the patients. Bacterial culture revealed the presence of Streptococcus bacteria in 53 throat swabs from patients 3, 4 and 7. Combination antibiotic, antiviral and glucocorticoid 54 therapy were administered. Unfortunately, patient 1 and 4 showed respiratory failure: patient 55 1 was given high flow noninvasive ventilation, while patient 4 was provided with nasal/face 56 mask ventilation (Table 1) .",

In total, we generated 56,565,928 sequence 92 reads that were de novo assembled and screened for potential aetiologic agents. Of the 93 384,096 contigs assembled by Megahit 8 , the longest (30,474 nucleotides [nt]) had high 94 abundance and was closely related to a bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate -bat-SL-CoVZC45 95 (GenBank Accession MG772933) -previously sampled in China, with a nt identity of 89.1% 96 (Table S1 and S2). The genome sequence of this novel virus, as well as its termini, were 97 determined and confirmed by RT-PCR 9 and 5'/3' RACE kits (TaKaRa), respectively. This 98 new virus was designated as WH-Human 1 coronavirus (WHCV) (and has also been referred 99 to as '2019-nCoV') and its whole genome sequence (29,903 nt) has been assigned GenBank 100 accession number MN908947. Remapping the RNA-seq data against the complete genome of 101 WHCV resulted in an assembly of 123,613 reads, providing 99.99% genome coverage at a 102 mean depth of 6.04X (range: 0.01X -78.84X) ( Figure S2 ). The viral load in the BALF sample 103 was estimated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) to be 3.95\u00d710 8 copies/mL ( Figure S3 ). 104 The viral genome organization of WHCV was characterized by sequence alignment 105 against two representative members of the genus Betacoronavirus: a human-origin 106 coronavirus (SARS-CoV Tor2, AY274119) and a bat-origin coronavirus 107 MG772933) (Figure 2 ). The un-translational regions (UTR) and open reading frame (ORF) of 108 WHCV were mapped based on this sequence alignment and ORF prediction. The WHCV 109 viral genome was similar to these two coronaviruses (Figure 2 and Table S3) , with a gene to SARS-CoV in that it carries a predicted ORF8 gene (366 nt in length) located between the 119 M and N ORF genes. The functions of WHCV ORFs were predicted based on those of known 120 coronaviruses and given in Table S5 . In a manner similar to SARS CoV Tor2, a leader 121 transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) and nine putative body TRSs could be readily 122 identified upstream of the 5' end of ORF, with the putative conserved TRS core sequence 123 appeared in two forms -the ACGAAC or CUAAAC (Table S6) .",

Phylogenetic analysis suggested that WHCV 181 represents a novel virus within genus Betacoronavirus (subgenus Sarbecovirus) and hence 182 that exhibits some genomic and phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV 1 , particularly in the 183 RBD. These genomic and clinical similarities to SARS, as well as its high abundance in 184 clinical samples, provides evidence for an association between WHCV and the ongoing 185 outbreak of respiratory disease in Wuhan. 186 The identification of multiple SARS-like-CoVs in bats led to the idea that these animals 187 act as the natural reservoir hosts of these viruses 19,20 . Although SARS-like viruses have been 188 identified widely in bats in China, viruses identical to SARS-CoV have not yet been 189 documented. Notably, WHCV is most closely related to bat coronaviruses, even exhibiting 190 100% aa similarity to Bat-SL-CoVZC45 in the nsp7 and E proteins. Hence, these data suggest 191 that bats are a possible reservoir host of WHCV.
