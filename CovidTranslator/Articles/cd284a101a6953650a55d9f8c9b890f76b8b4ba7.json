Although there are no data on the total number of people infected with NiV during an outbreak in Bangladesh in 2004, 75% of patients that were identified as having NiV-associated illness on the basis of positive serology or on epidemiological grounds died 17 . The range of species that are susceptible to henipaviruses is also quite remarkable. In addition to at least three pteropid species, NiV infects five terrestrial species in four mammalian orders [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Experimental henipavirus infections extend the number of susceptible terrestrial orders to five by including the Rodentia 24, 25 . This exceeds the extensive host range of canine distemper virus, a morbillivirus that naturally infects many species in the order Carnivora, such as dogs, ferrets, raccoons and lions, but can also experimentally infect hamsters and pigs (order Rodentia and Artiodactyla, respectively) 26, 27 .",

Globally, only a limited number of laboratories have appropriate facilities for growth and handling of BSL4 pathogens. Among these, even fewer have facilities in which animals, particularly large animals, can be infected with HeV or NiV and in which workers can be protected in plastic suits, supplied with breathing air. This has limited the number of investigations into the interaction of henipaviruses with their natural hosts, susceptible livestock and laboratory animal species. However, issues of personal safety and biocontainment are minimized when working with cloned henipavirus genes in eukaryotic expressions systems, and it is from such studies that most of our current knowledge on the structure and function of henipavirus proteins has been obtained. Before discussing the molecular observations that shed light on the unusual biological properties of these emerging pathogens, let us first summarize the emergence of HeV and NiV in a timeline (TIMELINE) and briefly review the clinical and pathological outcomes of virus infection.",

Infections can be associated with high morbidity and case-fatality rates, such as in HeV infection of horses and NiV and HeV infections of people, or lower morbidity and mortality rates, best represented by NiV infection of pigs 20, 22, [28] [29] [30] . HeV-infected horses develop acute, febrile respiratory disease that is sometimes accompanied by facial swelling, ataxia and, terminally, copious frothy nasal discharge 31 . Respiratory signs also predominate in NiV infection of pigs, especially in young animals that develop fever, nasal discharge, rapid and laboured respiration and a notable, harsh and non-productive cough, giving rise to the name 'barking-pig-disease' 22 . Nevertheless, neither HeV nor NiV cause a solely respiratory syndrome in horses and pigs, respectively.

Some Pteropus species are among the largest of all bats, weighing as much as 1.2 kg and displaying a wing span of up to 1.7 m. Pteropus species are unique because they lack the complex neural and behavioural mechanisms required for echolocation that characterize the vast majority of bat species. Instead, they have large eyes and they navigate visually, feeding mainly on fruit and flowers, which they locate by smell. chronic course, with serious neurological disease occurring late (in excess of 4 years) following a non-encephalitic or asymptomatic infection 34, 35 . The recurrence of neurological manifestations has also been noted in patients who had previously recovered from acute encephalitis (relapsed encephalitis) 34 . Cases of relapsed encephalitis presented from several months to nearly 2 years after the initial infection and, interestingly, two further cases of relapsed encephalitis were observed in the autumn of 2003, some 4 years after initial infection 35 . Taken together, there is nearly a 10% incidence rate of late encephalitic manifestation, with a mortality rate of 18%.

NiV sG fused to the Fc region of human IgG1 was used to immunoprecipitate the receptor from the plasma membrane of cells that were permissive for NiV F-mediated and G-mediated fusion. The receptor was identified as ephrin B2 by mass spectrometry 51 . In another approach, microarray analysis was used to identify mRNA sequences that are expressed in henipavirus-susceptible cells but not in cells refractory to henipavirus infection 52 . From a list of genes encoding predicted membrane-localized proteins found only in susceptible cells, only one -encoding ephrin B2could render resistant cells susceptible to fusion as well as infection not only by NiV but also by HeV 52 . Henipavirus infection of ephrin-B2-expressing susceptible cells was blocked by soluble recombinant ephrin B2 (REF. 52) , and the ability of ephrin B2 to serve as a receptor for virus was confirmed by showing that the sG protein of HeV and NiV bound to ephrin B2 in vitro with high affinity 52 .",

In a related process, cells expressing these glycoproteins on their surfaces can fuse with other receptor-bearing cells, resulting in the formation of multinucleated giant cells (syncytia), a hallmark of the paramyxovirus cytopathic effect. The paramyxovirus F glycoproteins are class I fusion proteins with two \u03b1-helical domains, referred to as heptad repeats, that are involved in the formation of a trimer-of-hairpins structure or six-helix bundle during or immediately following fusion [62] [63] [64] .

The minimum sequence requirement for efficient processing by furin in vitro is RXXR 72 , a sequence that is highly conserved in paramyxovirus F proteins. Viruses with this sequence, Henipaviruses, like other paramyxoviruses, contain a linear ribonucleoprotein (RNP) core consisting of a single-stranded genomic RNA molecule of negative polarity to which nucleocapsid proteins (N) are tightly bound in a ratio of one N for every six nucleotides 127, 139 . The RNP also contains smaller numbers of the phosphoprotein (P) and the large (L) polymerase protein, both of which are required to transcribe genomic RNA into mRNA and anti-genome RNA. The RNP core is surrounded by an envelope from which two spikes protrude; one is the receptor-binding glycoprotein (G) and the other the fusion (F) protein. The G and F proteins are arranged as homotetramers and homotrimers, respectively.

A comparison of the pathology observed in henipavirus-infected chiropteran and terrestrial mammals provides some insights into the different clinical outcomes of infection. The predominant lesion in natural and experimental henipavirus infection of terrestrial animals, including humans, is systemic vasculitis, which affects smaller vessels in many organs, with clinical symptoms arising predominantly from infection of the lung and/or the central nervous system 21, 136, 137 . Viral antigen is detected in syncytial cells in vascular endothelium and, in the case of NiV infection, in bronchial and alveolar epithelium. Henipaviruses are readily recovered from nasopharyngeal secretions, urine and internal organs including lung and brain 21, 138 . By contrast, infection of flying foxes with doses of HeV consistently shown to be lethal in horses generated only sporadic vasculitis in the lung, spleen, meninges, kidney and gastrointestinal tract, and only in a proportion of infected bats 134, 135 . Viral antigen is detected in the tunica media rather than endothelial cells. In infected pregnant flying foxes, antigen is observed in similar locations and in the placenta 135 .",

            "text": "Two observations might explain the lack of systemic disease in flying foxes. First, the presence of antigen in the tunica media rather than endothelial cells indicates that the latter might be spared from infection, therefore reducing the clinical effects associated with vasculitis. Second, the striking reduction in the level of antigen in flying foxes compared to horses and cats indicates that factors not found in terrestrial mammals that limit the ability of HeV to replicate could be at play in flying foxes. Indeed, after experimental infection of flying foxes with HeV, only half the animals show a rise in antibody titre, which is often low and sometimes of short duration (<3 weeks). Despite rigorous sampling regimes, virus has been isolated only infrequently, and where isolation was successful, positive sources included urine and the foetus, heart, placenta, kidney and spleen of two pregnant bats 134, 135 . Over millions of years of co-evolution, almost all viruses have evolved ways to evade the IFN-induced antiviral responses of their hosts 83, 85, 89, 90 . These mechanisms include the inhibition of host-cell transcription and translation and the consequent failure to synthesize IFN, inhibition of dsRNA-signalling and IFN-signalling pathways, and antagonizing the IFN-induced antiviral effector proteins. The anti-IFN activities of paramyxoviruses are encoded by the viral NS1 and NS2 genes in respiratory syncytial virus, a member of the Pneumovirinae subfamily 91, 92 , and by the P gene in the Paramyxovirinae. Products of the P gene inhibit both dsRNA signalling [93] [94] [95] [96] and IFN signalling [97] [98] [99] . The anti-IFN strategies used by paramyxoviruses vary, both between genera and among viruses within a specific genus. This is primarily because the P gene and its encoded proteins are both organized and expressed in a genus-specific manner",

            "text": "Inhibition of dsRNA signalling. In the henipaviruses, dsRNA signalling is inhibited not only by the accessory V protein, as observed for rubulaviruses and respiroviruses [93] [94] [95] 100, 101 , but surprisingly also by the accessory W protein (FIG. 3) . The V protein of HeV targets the helicase encoded by the melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), like its rubulavirus and respirovirus counterparts 102 . Whether the Figure 3 | Interferon (IFN) induction or double-stranded (ds)RNA signalling. The innate immune system depends on the ability of cells to detect the presence of unique, pathogen-specific molecules. The molecule considered most likely to be seen as foreign by virus-infected cells and activate the innate immune system is dsRNA, generated as a result of virus infection 87 . Several cellular sensors detect the dsRNA signal and respond by activating pre-existing transcription factors such as IFN-regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) and the general transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB 83, 97, [144] [145] [146] . Activated IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB are redistributed to the nucleus, where they cooperate with other transcriptional activators to induce transcription of the interferon (IFN)-\u03b1/\u03b2 genes. In one pathway, the sensor is an intracellular RNA helicase encoded by the retinoic inducible gene-1 (RIG1) or the melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5) 102, 147 . RIG-1 and MDA5 proteins are DExD/H-box RNA helicases that unwind dsRNA by virtue of their intrinsic ATPase activity. They also contain caspase-recruitment domains (CARD). The binding of dsRNA to the helicase has been hypothesized to result in the activation of the ATPase leading to conformational changes in CARD 102 . An activated CARD acts as an interface between signalling molecules, and the CARD of RIG-1 and MDA5 has been shown to interact with the CARD-like domain of a protein called IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) 148 to transmit a signal downstream, resulting in the phosphorylation of IRF-3 by the kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) and I\u03baB kinase \u03b5 (IKK-\u03b5) 149, 150 . Activated IRF-3 dimerizes and is translocated to the nucleus. Intracellular dsRNA signalling through RNA helicases also activates NF-\u03baB. The inhibitor of NF-\u03baB, I-\u03baB, is phosphorylated by an activated member of the IKK complex, and I-\u03baB is destroyed in proteasomes. NF-\u03baB is therefore released and translocated to the nucleus. A second IFN-induction pathway, likely to be activated after the helicase-dependant pathway, uses Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), which probably detects dsRNA released from virus-infected cells 151 . Signalling through TLR3 is mediated by an intracellular adaptor protein called TRIF, which signals two protein-kinase complexes, TBK-1-IKK-\u03b5 and IKK-\u03b1-IKK-\u03b2, and leads to the activation of both IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB.

Whereas SV5 targets STAT1 for proteasomal destruction, the anti-STAT activity of human parainfluenza virus 2 (hPIV2) is directed at STAT2 (REFS 101,106,107). In mumps virus (MuV)-infected cells, both STAT1 and STAT3 are eliminated, and STAT2 is left intact 108, 109 . Although STAT1 is destroyed in SV5-infected cells, there is an absolute requirement for STAT2 in the ubiquitin-ligase complex 110, 111 . In the case of hPIV2, where STAT2 is removed, STAT1 is required for ubiquitin-ligase activity 110, 112 . Although the cysteine-rich C-terminal domain of the MuV and hPIV2 V proteins can antagonize IFN signalling when expressed alone, and recombinant hPIV2 and SV5 V proteins lacking the C-terminal domain fail to inhibit IFN signalling, the cysteine-rich domain is not solely responsible for the inhibitory activity 94, 113 ; regions within the N-terminal region of the V protein are also required 114, 115 . the Jak-STAT pathway, a signalling pathway shared by many cytokines and growth factors that use members of the Janus tyrosine kinase family (TYK2 and JAK1) and a family of proteins called signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 83, 84, 90, 97 . Type I IFN binds to two heterologous receptor subunits (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) on the cell surface, and their dimerization leads to the activation of TYK2 and JAK1 tyrosine kinases bound to IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, respectively. TYK2 and JAK1 cross-activate each other and phosphorylate STATs. STAT1 and STAT2 form heterodimers and translocate to the nucleus where, in association with a DNA-binding protein p48 in a complex called IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), they activate the transcription of genes containing IFN-stimulated response elements within their promoters. Antiviral activity and the additional, profound effects that IFNs have on cellular physiology are mediated by hundreds of IFN-induced proteins. The best characterized antiviral IFN-inducible gene products include dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetases (2-5A) and RNase L and Mx proteins, which inhibit virus replication in various ways 82 . Paramyxoviruses block IFN signalling by targeting specific components of the Jak-STAT pathway (see text). By contrast, respiroviruses such as SeV and hPIV3 and morbilliviruses such as MeV use alternative strategies to block IFN signalling (FIG. 4) . SeV and hPIV3 inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1, STAT2 or TYK2, a process that requires the accessory C protein 95, 100, 101, 116 . Several anti-IFN-signalling strategies have been proposed for MeV, all of which leave STAT proteins intact but prevent their translocation to the nucleus 117 . In MeV-infected cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT2 is inhibited by the V protein and STAT1 is retained in a complex with the IFN receptor 118, 119 . The MeV C protein has also been implicated as an inhibitor of IFN signalling, but its precise role has yet to be confirmed 118, 119 .",

The figure shows a schematic representation of mRNAs transcribed from the P gene of henipaviruses compared with those of morbilliviruses, respiroviruses and rubulaviruses. In henipaviruses (a) and respiroviruses and morbilliviruses (b), the unedited P-gene transcript encodes the P protein, and the V protein is generated by a separate transcript containing a single G nucleotide inserted at the editing site. Insertion of two G residues generates a transcript encoding a protein usually called W. V and W proteins share their amino termini with the P protein. Compared with morbilliviruses and rubulaviruses, henipaviruses have an N-terminal 100-200-amino-acid extension that might have evolved to better equip the viruses to antagonize the cellular interferon response (see text). The P, V and W proteins have unique C-terminal domains. In the P protein, this region is essential for viral RNA synthesis and contains sites for binding to the N and L proteins in ribonucleoproteins. The C-terminal domain of the V protein is highly conserved among paramyxoviruses and contains seven perfectly conserved cysteine residues. The C-terminal domain of the W protein is frequently short because of the presence of a stop codon soon after the editing site, but in henipaviruses the W-specific domain is 43 amino acids in length, compared with 55 for the V-protein C-terminal domain 10 . The P genes of henipaviruses, morbilliviruses and most respiroviruses contain a second short discrete overlapping reading frame upstream of the editing site, which in P, V and W mRNAs encodes the C protein. The structure of the P gene differs in rubulaviruses (c), where the primary transcript encodes the V protein, and transcripts with two G nucleotides inserted at the editing site generate the P protein. Note the long 3\u2032 untranslated region of the henipavirus P gene RNAs. expressed in virus-infected cells. Immunoblot analysis using monospecific antibodies raised to the unique C-terminal region of the V protein confirms its presence in infected cells 10 . Any correlation between the virulence of henipaviruses and the wide range of anti-IFN strategies that they have acquired awaits the application of reverse genetics and the study of mutant-virus pathogenesis in vivo. Nevertheless, it can be speculated that the pathogenicity of henipaviruses in most terrestrial species, compared with their subclinical replication in Chiroptera, might be related to the ability of the virus to circumvent the host IFN response, and it will be of interest to determine the anti-IFN activities of the HeV and NiV P-gene products in chiropteran cells.",

This is due primarily to our ignorance of virus ecology in bats. Although mechanisms of transmission from bat to livestock and human have been postulated, there are few data on which we can rely to develop models of virus transmission or riskmanagement strategies for control of diseases caused by henipaviruses in the future. The high virulence of henipaviruses, the absence of therapeutic intervention strategies and vaccines and their classification as BSL4 pathogens have undoubtedly impeded the rate at which information has been generated on the biology and pathogenesis of HeV and NiV. However, recent investigations into the structure and function of henipavirus proteins expressed by cloned P, F and G genes in cultured cells have provided valuable information on the nature of the relationship between henipaviruses and the cells they infect, and suggest explanations for the observed interaction between henipaviruses and their terrestrial hosts.",

The widespread cellular distribution of ephrin B2, especially in vascular endothelial cells, also provides an explanation for one of the most frequently observed outcomes of henipavirus infection, namely systemic involvement of endothelial cells. However, it remains to be seen if ephrin B2 will be the universal henipavirus receptor used by all species and all naturally occurring HeV and NiV strains, or variants such as those implicated in the outbreaks of disease in Bangladesh where human-to-human transmission has been documented.",

An appreciation of the factors that contribute to the virulence of henipaviruses in terrestrial hosts versus the outcome of virus infection of flying foxes might provide crucial clues. Is ephrin B2 the receptor in bats? In light of the highly conserved nature of murine and human ephrin B2 proteins, especially in the ectodomain, there will probably be significant homology in the ephrin B2 homologue from flying foxes. Does the ubiquity of cathepsin L, the F protease cleavage enzyme, extend to a range of flying-fox cells and tissues? Do henipaviruses use the same range of P-gene products to inhibit IFN in bats? If henipaviruses inhibit dsRNA signalling and IFN signalling in chiropteran cells, their limited replication observed in flying foxes could be due to other factors such as the nature, density and location of the bat cell receptors or the ability of the viral C protein to inhibit viral RNA synthesis in bat cells more effectively than has been observed in mammalian cells 127 . The C protein encoded by the respirovirus P gene has been shown to downregulate viral genome amplification 128, 129 and transcription 127, 130 .",

Galectin-1, an endogenous lectin secreted by various cell types, has been shown to inhibit henipavirus envelope-glycoprotein-mediated cell fusion, probably by aberrantly oligomerizing NiV F and G glycoproteins 132 . In addition to this direct effect on virus replication, galectin-1 might also act indirectly to limit NiV replication because it enhances dendriticcell production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6), which has an essential role in the final differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells 132 . The capacity of henipavirus P-gene products to abrogate the STAT-dependent IL-6-signalling pathway in terrestrial or chiropteran cells remains to be determined. The development of a range of anti-IFN strategies by henipaviruses might have evolved to maximize virus replication under conditions of restricted growth in bats. Finally, the ability to conduct these studies using recombinant molecular biological techniques on otherwise highly pathogenic and dangerous viruses has provided important information on the biology of HeV and NiV, which should prove exploitable in the near future and offer new or novel approaches in treating or preventing henipavirus infection.",
