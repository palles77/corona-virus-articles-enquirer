PED virus was isolated from the small intestine of piglets inoculated with PED samples and cultured in Vero, porcine bladder and kidney cells propagated in collagen-coated tissue culture plates in maintenance medium (MM) containing trypsin. In porcine bladder and kidney cell cultures inoculated with isolated PED virus, cytopathic effects (CPE) including cell fusion were detected. Speci\u00aec brilliant\u00afuorescence was observed in the cytoplasm of these cells. Two-and 7-day old, and 2-, 4-, 8-and 12-week old speci\u00aec pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were orally inoculated with PED virus isolated from an outbreak. All 2-and 7-day old pigs inoculated developed severe watery diarrhea from post-inoculation day (PID) 1 and died between PID 3 and 4. Although three of \u00aeve 2-week old pigs developed diarrhea on PID 1\u00b14, they eventually recovered. In the 4-week old group, three of \u00aeve pigs had mild diarrhea for 1\u00b12 days. None of the 8-and 12-week old pigs showed any clinical signs. Antibodies against PED virus were detected in all surviving pigs by virus neutralization (VN) test and immuno\u00afuorescence assay (IFA). Therefore, there is an age-dependent resistance to pathogenic PED virus infection in pigs. #",

Hofmann and Wyler (1988) \u00aerst isolated and adapted PED virus to serial propagation in Vero cells, which are derived from African green monkeys, by adding trypsin to the MM. However, attempts at isolating PED virus in porcine cell cultures in the presence or absence of trypsin have been unsuccessful until now. Previous reports suggested that porcine cell cultures were damaged by trypsin, which then might not be able to support virus replication (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988) . In the present study, collagen-coated plates were used; cells cultured on collagen-coated plates are more resistant to trypsin (data not shown). This might be the main reason for the successful isolation of PED virus in porcine cell cultures in the present study. This method may be suitable for cell culture in medium containing trypsin or other proteinases. PED virus was isolated in SB1 cells but not in SB2 cells. Although PED virus propagated in SB1 cells showed CPE in SB2 cells, the titer in these cells was lower than in SB1 cells (data not shown); the cells had been derived from the bladder of different pigs and were used at the same passage numbers. The reason for the difference in susceptibility for viral propagation between these cells is not known. Upon experimental infection, 2-and 7-day old pigs inoculated with PED virus developed severe diarrhea and died. The 2-and 4-week old pigs showed mild diarrhea after inoculation and survived. The 8-and 12-week old pigs did not show any clinical signs, but developed antibody against PED virus. Coussement et al. (1982) described that 2-or 3-day old cesarian-derived piglets infected oronasally with the CV777 strain of PED virus showed severe diarrhea after an incubation period of 22\u00b136 h. Debouck and Pensaert (1980) reported that pigs between 1 and 20 days old experimentally inoculated with PED virus developed diarrhea and some pigs younger than 19 days old died. These results are similar to those of the present study.",

In the present study, however, severe diarrhea was only observed in 2-and 7-day old pigs. The difference in the clinical signs between \u00aeeld cases and the present examination may re\u00afect differences in the infectious dose, the susceptibility of pigs, the environmental conditions or the virulence of the strains. The majority of herd outbreaks of PED occur during the colder months, especially between January and April (Tsuda, 1997) . In TGE virus infection, (Shimizu et al., 1978; Shimizu and Shimizu, 1979) showed that a high ambient temperature resulted in increased disease resistance, while a low ambient temperature or temperature changes caused a dramatic enhancement in clinical signs. In the present study, 2\u00b112-week old pigs were kept at 23\u00b1 248C throughout the study. Consequently, a stable comfortable ambient temperature might induce resistance to clinical disease after PED virus infection.",
