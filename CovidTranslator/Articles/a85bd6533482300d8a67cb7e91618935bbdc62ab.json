However, a single donor muscle biopsy is unlikely to provide enough cells to effectively transplant the muscle mass of a patient affected by muscular dystrophy. Expansion of cells ex vivo using traditional culture techniques significantly reduces engraftment potential. We hypothesized that activation of Notch signaling during ex vivo expansion would maintain donor cell engraftment potential. In this study, we expanded freshly isolated canine muscle-derived cells on tissue culture plates coated with Delta-1 ext -IgG to activate Notch signaling or with human IgG as a control. A model of canine-to-murine xenotransplantation was used to quantitatively compare canine muscle cell engraftment, and determine if engrafted donor cells could function as satellite cells in vivo. We show that Delta-1 ext -IgG inhibited differentiation of canine muscle-derived cells, and increased the level of genes normally expressed in myogenic precursors. Moreover, cells expanded on Delta-1 ext -IgG resulted in a significant increase in the number of donor-derived fibers, as compared to cells expanded on human IgG, reaching engraftment levels similar to freshly isolated cells. Importantly, cells expanded on Delta-1 ext -IgG engrafted to the recipient satellite cell niche, and contributed to further regeneration. A similar strategy of expanding human muscle-derived cells on Notch ligand might facilitate engraftment and muscle regeneration for patients affected with muscular dystrophy.",

Transplantation of myogenic stem cells possesses great potential for longterm repair of dystrophic muscle. Indeed, intramuscular injection of adult satellite cellderived myoblasts from a normal syngeneic donor into mdx mice results in the formation of dystrophin-positive muscle fibers [1] [2] [3] . Furthermore, intramuscular injection of allogeneic donor muscle-derived cells into chimeric cxmd canine recipients restored dystrophin expression for at least 24 weeks in the absence of post-transplant immunosuppression, indicating that cell transplantation may be a viable therapeutic option for muscular dystrophy [4] .",

Skeletal muscle injury in mice results in increased expression of Delta-like-1(Dll-1) within the niche, and activation of Notch signaling increases the number of proliferating myogenic cells and promotes muscle regeneration after injury [13] . In vitro, overexpression of an activated form of Notch downregulates expression of MyoD and myogenin and inhibits myogenic differentiation in primary mouse myoblasts and C2C12 cells [13, 14] . The extracellular domain of Dll-1 fused to the Fc portion of human IgG (Delta-1 ext -IgG) is sufficient for inhibition of differentiation in cultured C2C12 myoblasts; however, immobilization is required for effective signaling [15] . Therefore, we compared canine muscle-derived cells expanded on immobilized Delta-1 ext -IgG to cells expanded on immobilized human IgG control. We show that activation of Notch signaling during expansion of canine muscle-derived cells inhibited myogenic differentiation. Furthermore, canine-to-mouse xenotransplantation demonstrated that activation of Notch signaling during donor cell expansion maintained engraftment potential.",

The mouse hindlimb was pre-irradiated with 12 Gy of ionizing radiation to prevent regeneration by host mouse satellite cells and pre-treated with BaCl 2 to induce muscle degeneration (see Methods). On average, injection of 50,000 freshly isolated canine musclederived cells appeared to be equivalent to injection of 5 single canine muscle fibers from the same donor muscle biopsy, comparing both the number of fibers expressing canine dystrophin and the number of nuclei expressing Pax7 and canine lamin A/C ( Figure 1A,  1B) .

The authors hypothesize that enzymatic disruption may cleave cell surface proteins required for donor cell engraftment. However, it is also possible that time away from the fiber or niche has a negative effect on donor satellite cell engraftment. Indeed, culturing muscle-derived cells on a substrate with a similar stiffness to normal skeletal muscle (12kPa) improves donor cell engraftment, indicating that biophysical signaling is important for satellite cell stemness [18, 19] .",

BaCl 2 -induced regeneration in muscle transplanted with canine cells expanded on Delta-1 ext -IgG increased the number of fibers expressing canine dystrophin, and maintained the number of donor Pax7 + cells. Moreover, engraftment was detected in secondary recipients of Delta-1 ext -IgG expanded cells. Together, this indicates that donor cells expanded on Delta-1 ext -IgG that had engrafted into recipient muscle participated in muscle repair similar to satellite cells, and had the capacity to self-renew, similar to longterm repopulating hematopoietic cells. Together, these data support the hypothesis that activating Notch signaling during expansion of canine muscle-derived cells maintained a subpopulation of progenitor cells.",

The ability to expand donor muscle-derived cells ex vivo will be an important step towards making cell transplantation a possible therapy for muscular dystrophies. Similarly, immobilized Delta-1 ext -IgG inhibits differentiation of human CD34 + CD38\u2212 cord blood precursors, and dramatically increases the number of precursors capable of repopulating NOD/SCID mice [8, 9, 11] . A phase 1 clinical trial of transplantation of ex vivo expanded CD34 + CD38-cord blood precursors is currently underway in patients with high risk leukemias, and appears to successfully promote donor cell engraftment [12] . Our current study indicates that a similar strategy of expanding human muscle-derived cells on Notch ligand might facilitate engraftment and muscle regeneration and should be considered for future studies of human muscle transplantation.",
