And some important parameters are obtained such as the transmission rate by applying this model to analyzing the situation in Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada at the outbreak of SARS. Then forecast of the transmission of SARS is drawn out here by the adjustment of parameters (such as quarantined rate) in the model. It is obvious that inflexion lies on the crunode of the graph, which indicates the big difference in transmission characteristics between the epidemic under control and not under control. This model can also be used in the comparison of the control effectiveness among different regions. The results from this model match well with the actual data in Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada and as a by-product, the index of the effectiveness of control in the later period can be acquired. It offers some quantitative indexes, which may help the further research in epidemic diseases.",

It made great damage to world economy. After June, although SARS was nearly under control, more than 8000 persons were infected and over 700 persons were killed in this epidemic. However, since the end of 2003, another some people had been infected in Singapore, Taiwan and Guangdong [1] . This brought a new round of scare. As a result it is very necessary to investigate SARS epidemiology characteristic in mathematical model. And it will have good consult function for further study of this kind of epidemic.",

Chowell et al. put forward the SEIJR (S, susceptible; E, exposed; I, infective; J, diagnosed; R, recovered) model and proceeded with theoretical deduction. But it was an experience model when contrasting the actual data and theoretically estimated data. It can be used to estimate the cumulative number with model e n , get the r value in Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore, and roughly estimate the time SARS started locally, and epidemic parameters as well [2] . Moreover, Lipsitch et al. simulated the SARS epidemiology characteristics in contrast method, then made use of limited data to scale the function of control measures carefully, and statistically analyzed the data and characteristics, and used a model to estimate the influence on basic reproductive number R 0 and estimated R 0 value [3] . In Riley's article, space dynamics model was adopted to simulate the Hong Kong SARS breakout, considering the super spread events (SSE) at the same time [4] . Then Dye et al. simulated the SARS earlier-period spreads with dynamics model. Based on the analysis of Riley and Lipsitch model, Dye considered that their analysis is not quite accurate because of limited data for SSE and confused influence for control measures [5] . Chen et al. used some statistical data based on stochastic model to study SARS spread [6] . A German newspaper made use of the index curve to match the cumulative case number [7] . Razum et al. tried to match the total case number in index curve and lines, pointing out that the enormous differences between these and these two models are both unreasonable, and suggested to estimate and forecast the epidemic trend based on case number every day [8] . Donnelly et al. looked into the Hong Kong SARS characteristics of epidemiology and analyzed this statistically [9] . Tuen developed the model of SEIRP from SIR, and made use of some SARS data of each locality to estimate the parameters [10] .",

            "text": "When SARS began to spread in 2003, this disease broke out in natural status without any valid control for the lack of understanding this kind of epidemiology. Only when this disease developed to serious status in countries (or regions), did the concerned governments take some control measures (such as quarantine, restriction on personnel contacts, etc.). Therefore in Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada, there was an inflexion in the curve of cumulative case number of the region, and obviously different regulations were laid in SARS spread before control and after control. Wu et al. used large system theory to predict the SARS and put forward the inflexion concept under government strong control 1) . This paper is to simplify SEIJR model into SIJR model, reducing the uncertain parameters in the model. It will be convenient to identify and analyze the parameters, but keep the important characteristics of disease as well. Firstly, the data curve before control is fitted to get the parameters such as transmission rate and SARS start time. After government adopted strict control measures l can be adjusted to meet the situation very well. Based on simulation in Hong Kong, Singapore and Canada, as long as the appropriate l value is chosen, the simulation result matches the actual data perfectly. It shows that this simple method can be used to predict SARS spread hereafter. What is more, after examining l value in different regions by means of review research to evaluate the validity of control measures, the quantitative index is provided. ",

Based on the actual data in Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore [20] , \u03b2 and t 0 for each locality can be acquired. The model-fit curve can be got after parameters are introduced into 0 ( , ) c J i t \u03b2 + . These two parameters in each region can be checked in Table 1 . Moreover, considering the measures adopted in 3 regions [4] [5] [6] [7] , the period we choose to apply the model is: (\u2171) SARS ex-period fit before control. According to the anterior parameter estimation, the quarantine rate is assumed as l=1 (supposed that there were no quarantine measures before control). After l is introduced into eq. (3), J c can be calculated, and, accordingly, the model-fit curve is gained as well (Figs. 3 and 4) . Here, the dotted line is to represent curve data (eq. (3)) and \"+\" is to represent the actual data. At the same time, these parameters (listed in Table 1 ) simulated before control will be used as the basis of SARS spread prediction. After contrast of model-fit curve and actual data diagram in Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore, it can be concluded that the model can fit the actual data very well and describe SARS development trend. In this way, if without control and with the constant quarantine rate which equals 1, cumulative case number will be increased by the index number, and the predicted result will be the extension of the actual data curve before control. (\u2172) SARS forecast after control. With the basic parameters of epidemiology and model-fit curve, it is enough to forecast SARS development trend after control. But, here, one parameter should be corrected first. According to the research, \u03b2 that reflects the disease characteristics keeps stable in each region; however, t 0 fluctuates much. Moreover, the other parameters except t 0 can be got by the case data statistics before control (recovered rate, death rate, etc.) [20] and data (diagnosed rate, etc.) in the literature [1] . Because these parameters all describe essential characteristics of the epidemiology and are only relative with SARS itself, it is effective both before control and after control before specific medicine or specific therapy is found. Thus in the forecast of the development trend after control, just keep \u03b2 constant at the inflexion, and iterate t 0 to get the corrected one. In this way, we can predict the trend of SARS in Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore by varying the quarantine rate. Table 2 .",

Besides this, l is stable and in accord with actual status. Moreover, through the analysis of quarantine rate's influence upon SARS control, it is easy to quantify the effectiveness of quarantine measures. The paper compares effectiveness of different control measures in different regions. It shows that all the measures are somewhat effective in all these regions, and the basic reproductive number R 0 has shown an incredible declining trend. It will provide a good and useful consultation by the way of forecasting the trend of this disease after control measures are taken. Except all these, neither this model nor the empirical model in the literature can be used to deduce the exact spreading days and SARS start time.",
