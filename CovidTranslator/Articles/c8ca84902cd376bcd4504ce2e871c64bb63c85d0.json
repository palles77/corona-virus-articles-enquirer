No prior studies using molecular techniques to examine RSV transmission in the community childcare setting have been performed. Objectives: We seek to characterize the molecular epidemiology of RSV transmission in childcare to evaluate the impact of RSV disease in a community-based population. Methods: We sequenced RSV-positive nasopharyngeal samples from a prospective longitudinal study of respiratory illnesses among children enrolled in childcare during three winter seasons. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to identify unique viral strains. Results: RSV was detected in 59 (11%) illnesses. Compared to RSV-negative illnesses, RSV-positive illnesses were associated with longer symptom duration and increased frequency of health care visits. Another respiratory virus was detected in 42 (71%) RSV-positive illnesses. RSV viral load did not differ between RSV-positive illnesses with and without another respiratory virus identified (P = 0.38). In two childcare rooms, 50% of the children had RSV detected within six days of the first case. Five (38%) of 13 illness episodes from one childcare room were sequenced and shown to be the same viral strain, suggesting rapid child-to-child transmission within the room over a 16 day period. Conclusions: RSV is rapidly transmitted within childcare. Childcare facilities may serve as ideal sites for evaluation of new prevention strategies given the high burden of RSV disease in this population and the rapidity of RSV spread between children.",

The burden of RSV disease in the community is substantial, though molecular epidemiology of transmission is not well-characterized. [4] [5] [6] [7] In the United States, 41% of children attend childcare, 8 which is a known risk factor for severe RSV disease, and likely serves as an important route of transmission to other attendees and family members. 9, 10 The socioeconomic impact of illness associated with childcare attendance includes work days missed and parental stress. 11 A 16-year longitudinal study of childcare attendees in the 1980s using culture techniques showed that RSV was the most frequent viral etiology of respiratory illness. 2, 12 The molecular epidemiology of RSV transmission is characterized by sequencing the hypervariable region of the glycoprotein (G) coding region. 13 Transmission of genetically identical virus as well as the presence of multiple distinct co-circulating strains have been described in nosocomial settings. 14, 15 No studies have been performed to characterize RSV disease burden in a community childcare setting using current molecular diagnostics despite its importance as a potential setting for public health interventions, such as vaccines and infection control measures.",

An illness episode was defined as at least 2 of 5 symptoms, including cough, rhinorrhea, fever, wheezing and nasal congestion. Each child had a nasopharyngeal swab collected at symptom onset and weekly thereafter until symptom resolution. A daily symptom diary was completed by the caregiver for 10 days following symptom onset. From February 1, 2006 to May 1, 2006, nasopharyngeal samples were collected only with illness episodes.

Subtyping was performed for RSV-positive samples according to previously published protocols. 19, 20 RSV-positive samples were sequenced using a hemi-nested PCR protocol targeting the second hypervariable region of the glycoprotein coding region. 21 Complementary DNA (M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase, USB Corp, Cleveland, OH) was amplified with forward primer GAB (5 -YCAYTTTGAAGTGTTCAACTT-3 ; G gene, 504-524 nt) and reverse primer FV (5 -GTTATGACACTGGTATACCAACC-3 ; F gene, 186-163 nt). The amplification procedure included 2 min at 98 \u2022 C, 35 cycles of 98 \u2022 C for 30 s, 55 \u2022 C for 1 min, and 72 \u2022 C for 1 min, followed by 72 \u2022 C for 7 min.

Five hundred base pair amplicons were gel-extracted (QIAquick Gel Extraction kit, QIAGEN, Germany) and sequenced (Applied Biosystems 3730XL sequencer). PCR products from some samples were cloned (TOPO TA Cloning Kit, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) prior to sequencing.

Samples from two episodes 14 days apart in Y11 contained the same RSV strain, as did 5 episodes in X3 that spanned the entire 16-day period. These results suggest that child-to-child transmission of one viral strain was likely responsible for these clusters of RSV illness. A third cluster of seven RSV episodes was identified in room X3 during Season 1, consisting of two subtype A and five subtype B viruses. Sequencing of the two subtype A episodes showed identical viral strains, while sequencing of three subtype B episodes showed two different viral strains, indicating that multiple viral strains co-circulated simultaneously in the childcare room (Fig. 6) .

At the same time, three subtype A episodes with identical strains were identified in rooms X3 and Y2. These two facilities were located several kilometers apart, making it less likely that direct inoculation from child-to-child was the mode of transmission. No RSV-positive sibling pairs enrolled in the study were located in different facilities. However, sibling pairs who were not enrolled in the study or parents, many of whom worked on Fort Lewis, may also have transmitted RSV. In Season 3, eight subtype A episodes with Fig. 2 . Epidemic curve of RSV spread within childcare rooms by subtype in Season 1 (2A) and Season 3 (2B) from November to January. The y-axis is the number of episodes. The x-axis represents time. Each box represents one episode. The numbers and letters within each box represent the facility and room number of the child. One, eight, and six episodes in seasons 1, 2, and 3, respectively, were not included due to occurrence outside of the time period shown. identical strains were detected in Facility X in rooms X3, X5, and X6 from November 18 to December 5, suggesting transmission both within and between rooms within Facility X during Season 3, with temporal and geographic clustering of two additional clusters of identical strains in December and March (Fig. 6) .",

We showed that within one week of the first case, another child had an identical strain detected, suggesting rapid child-to-child transmission within the facility. Further, we demonstrated that once RSV was detected in a childcare room, over 50% of children in the room became infected within a week. While there was clustering of identical viral strains within rooms and facilities, we also found that several unique viral strains circulated in a room simultaneously during an outbreak. This is consistent with data from outbreaks in bone marrow transplant settings, 35,36 but has not been previously investigated in the childcare setting, an important source of community-acquired respiratory viral infections. Viral transmission correlates directly with degree and intensity of hand or nasal inoculation with large droplets or fomites, 37, 38 activities which are likely to be frequent within childcare. Although infection control measures including handwashing and sanitation of surfaces were utilized according to current guidelines in our facilities, [39] [40] [41] our results imply that RSV is readily transmitted in childcare facilities despite these routine measures.",

Children may shed and transmit RSV after they become asymptomatic, and we did not perform regular sampling in asymptomatic participants. 42 Although we captured ten days of symptom data, younger children may experience symptoms lasting longer. Further, we were not able to use a preceding asymptomatic period as criteria for a new illness episode. Many children enrolled in our childcare facilities were never symptom-free, particularly when considering cough and rhinorrhea. Each new illness episode that was close in timing to a prior illness episode was reviewed by the study staff and a consensus decision was made to decide whether this should be classified as a new episode versus a continuation of a prior illness. In general, children who developed new symptoms, as opposed to worsening of previous symptoms, were classified as having a new illness episode. Finally, we sequenced RSV from only 42% of episodes, though our ability to sequence viruses from clinical samples is consistent with other studies characterizing RSV transmission. 35 Our study shows that the childcare setting is a significant source of rapid child-to-child RSV transmission, and that once acquired, RSV leads to significantly greater symptom duration than other respiratory viruses. These results highlight the significant clinical and socioeconomic impact of RSV in the community, and emphasize that the childcare setting is an important potential site of interventions to reduce the burden of RSV disease. Interventions that reduce RSV transmission in childcare, such as vaccines and enhanced infection control measures, are likely to have a substantial clinical and socioeconomic impact. ",
