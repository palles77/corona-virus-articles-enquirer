Expression microarray analysis showed up-regulation and down-regulation of many genes involved in the defense, inflammatory response and intracellular signaling pathways including chemokine, apoptosis, MAPK, Notch, Jak-STAT, T-cell receptor and complement and coagulation cascades. We have revealed signature patterns of gene expression in mice infected with two different classes of pathogens: influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR results confirmed microarray results for most of the genes tested. These studies document clear differences in gene expression profiles between mice infected with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. Identification of genes that are differentially expressed after respiratory infections can provide insights into the mechanisms by which the host interacts with different pathogens, useful information about stage of diseases and selection of suitable targets for early diagnosis and treatments. The advantage of this novel approach is that the detection of pathogens is based on the differences in host gene expression profiles in response to different pathogens instead of detecting pathogens directly.",

            "text": "One of the major difficulties in early diagnosis of respiratory infectious diseases lies in the presentation of patients with similar symptoms that can be caused by a wide variety of pathogens, some of which cause minor self-limiting illnesses while others can cause life-threatening complications. The 2003 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and the recent outbreaks of a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus A (H5N1) among poultry in eight Asian countries are reminders of the ever-present risks from respiratory pathogens [1] . Based on the WHO report of May 29, 2006 , there have been 224 of laboratory-confirmed human cases and 127 deaths mostly in Asia caused by avian influenza A (H5N1) since December 2003 (http://www. who.int/en/). Deaths occurred in otherwise healthy young individuals, which is reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Infection with influenza viruses can result in illness ranging from mild to severe and life-threatening complications [2, 3] . Influenza virus A belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family of segmented, negative-stranded RNA viruses and has the potential to cause pandemics [4, 5] . The bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae is a major cause of bacterial pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, and sinusitis. Influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae represent two different classes of respiratory disease pathogens. Because influenza, pneumonia and other respiratory infections can cause similar flu-like symptoms, it is difficult to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone. There are many subtypes of influenza viruses and many serotypes of pneumococci, hence diagnosis of so many different agents directly for early detection and differentiation of etiologic agents does not seem practical. During a respiratory illness outbreak such as influenza pandemics, early detection of respiratory pathogens can be very important in determining the cause of the outbreak.",

Microarray profiles for microbial infection could lead to the better understanding of host-pathogen interactions and the identification of biomarkers for specific microbial infection and ultimately yield important diagnostic tools [8] .

The combination of microarray and the use of model animals is a suitable strategy to explore the gene expression profiles and should provide a useful system to identify new targets for detection of respiratory pathogens and clinical investigation. Detection of differentially expressed host genes in response to respiratory infections could be a valuable tool for the differential diagnosis of diseases particularly in the early stages of infection. Identification of mouse model biomarkers for respiratory tract diseases is an important step towards identification of human biomarkers that could eventually lead to tests for early diagnosis of respiratory tract infections.",

Data from the hybridization experiment were viewed as a normalized ratio (Cy5/Cy3) in which significant deviations from 1 (no change) are indicative of increased (>1.5) or decreased (<0.66) levels of gene expression in infected mice relative to uninfected mice. To explore the similarity and dissimilarity between samples and genes, supervised clustering algorithms were applied [16, 17] .

Spleen is the largest lymphatic system organ that contains germinal centers in which B lymphocytes proliferate, macrophages that ingest and process antigens, and regions that house several kinds of T lymphocytes. Signs of illness such as weight loss and lethargy were measured daily after infection. Symptoms of infection peaked between 2 and 3 days and mice recovered by day 7. Total RNAs isolated from uninfected or infected mice were labeled separately with Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP and hybridized to cDNA microarray containing 15,000 mouse genes, as described in Section 2. Hybridization intensity for each gene on the microarray was compared with the uninfected control samples. The relative abundance of transcripts from each gene was reflected by the ratio of 'green' to 'red' fluorescence measured at the array element representing that gene. The greater relative abundance of mRNA in mouse infected with pathogens resulted in a higher ratio of green-labeled to red-labeled copies of the corresponding cDNA. Genes whose relative transcription levels increased by >1.5-fold were considered as up-regulated, and whose relative transcription levels less than 0.66 were considered as down-regulated. Genes whose relative transcription levels were between 0.66 and 1.5 were considered as no change.",

            "text": "Analysis of the microarray results demonstrated that several genes down-regulated following infection with influenza virus A or S. pneumoniae were also involved in the intracellular signaling pathways including stress-related genes glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1), glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4), integrin linked kinase (Ilk), heat shock protein 90 kDa beta member 1 (Hsp90b1), prothymosin alpha (Ptma), mitogen activated protein kinase 3 (Mapk3), Janus kinase 1 (Jak1), protein kinase X-linked (Prkx), attractin (Atrn), and catenin (cadherin associated protein) delta 1 (Ctnnd1). Integrin linked kinase (Ilk) has a role in immune-cell trafficking and survival via modulation of Akt-and Rac-dependent substrates, and have implications for cell recruitment in both homeostatic and pathological processes [25] . Glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1) functions as the primary protection against acute oxidative stress and has a role in modulating molecular pathways involved in both cell death and inflammatory cascades in brain following injury. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) plays a role in vivo in the mechanism of apoptosis induced by oxidative stress that most likely occurs through oxidative damage to mitochondrial phospholipids such as cardiolipin [26] . Heat shock protein 90 kDa beta member 1 (Hsp90b1) is an inflammatory mediator that selectively primes CD8 \u00fe T-cell effector function. Prothymosin alpha (Ptma) induces functional maturation and interleukin-12 (IL-12) production by fungus-pulsed dendritic cells through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB-dependent pathway, which occurs by signaling through the myeloid differentiation factor 88-dependent pathway, involving distinct Toll-like receptors [27] . Mapk3 plays a role in regulation of epidermal chemokine expression and skin inflammation [28] as well as many other functions. Janus kinase 1 and 2 (Jak1/2) are client proteins of Hsp90 alpha and beta (Hspcb); Hsp90 and CDC37 play a critical role in types I and II interferon pathways [29] . Jak1 and Jak2 must work cooperatively and their actions are dependent on having normal kinase activity to trigger downstream signals leading to interleukin-3 independent proliferation [30] . Protein kinase X-linked (Prkx) is involved in several signaling pathways including Calcium, WNT, MAPK and Insulin pathways. Catenin is involved in WNT receptor signaling pathway and leukocyte transendothelial migration. Taken together, these results revealed that the most dramatic differences in microarray profiles between infections with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae were observed at day 1 post-infection, and they suggested that many important events related to intracellular signaling pathways and pathogenesis occur early in infection.",

Selenoprotein K and heat shock protein 1 beta are related to stress responses. Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 is involved in the carbon fixation and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathways. Thrombomodulin participates in complement and coagulation cascades. p21 protein activator 2 is related to the MAPK signaling pathway. Prothymosin alpha induces functional maturation and interleukin-12 production by fungus-pulsed dendritic cells through the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase/nuclear factor (NF)-kap-paB-dependent pathway [27] . Mesoderm posterior 2 is involved in Notch signaling pathway. Cell division cycle 42 homolog is activated by interleukin 3 (IL-3) and is involved in different pathways such as Leukocyte transendothelial migration, MAPK signaling, T-cell receptor signaling and adherens junction. There were 33 genes exclusively down-regulated in mice infected with S. pneumoniae but unchanged in mice infected with influenza virus A at day 1. These genes included immediate early response 5 (Ier5), which may play an important role in mediating the cellular response to mitogenic signals; heat shock protein 90 kDa beta member 1 (Hsp90b1), which is an inflammatory mediator that selectively primes CD8 \u00fe T-cell effector function; SAM domain and HD domain 1 (Samhd1), which is related to immune response and signal transduction; lymphocyte antigen 6 complex locus E (Ly6e), which is a signal transducer situated at the nexus of surface molecules regulating death receptor-mediated apoptosis in hepatoma; annexin A6 (Anxa6), which may function as an acidic pH binding site or receptor; mitogen activated protein kinase 3 (Mapk3), which is involved in many pathways such as adherens junction, gap junction, insulin signaling, MAPK signaling, TGF-beta signaling and natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity; tyrosine kinase non-receptor 2 (Tnk2); ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member 8 (Abcb8), which is related to defense and immunity; cathepsin B (CtsB), which has a role in the lysosomal pathway of apoptosis in tissue injury, inflammation and fibrogenesis; and cadherin associated protein delta 1 (Catns), which is involved in adherens junction pathway. We also found that several down-regulated genes were involved in the transcription and translation regulations. These included the general transcription factor II i gene (Gtf2i), RNA polymerase II transcriptional coactivator gene (Rpo2tc1), golgi reassembly stacking protein 2 (Gorasp2), myocyte enhancer factor 2A (Mef2a), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5 (Eif5), cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (Cpeb4), proteasome subunit alpha type 7 (Psma7), and ubiquitin specific peptidase 9, X chromosome (Usp9x). The genes exclusively up-regulated or down-regulated in mice infected with influenza virus A or S. pneumoniae are good candidate genes that could be used as biomarkers to distinguish individuals exposed to specific classes of pathogens such as influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. Application of cDNA microarray technology to study the differences between host responses in mice infected with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae provides an opportunity to identify host proteins essential for these two different pathogens, that could lead to the better understanding of host-pathogen interactions, the identification of virulence-associated genes at the gene transcription level and the identification of new biomarkers for early diagnosis of infectious diseases such as influenza and design of novel therapeutic agents against influenza viruses.",

One of the major hurdles in the early diagnosis of respiratory infectious diseases is that a wide variety of pathogens can cause similar symptoms in patients, some of which cause minor diseases while others can cause significant lethality such as life-threatening avian influenza virus H5N1 [37] . Global gene expression profiling using cDNA microarrays has been increasingly used to study complex interactions between host and pathogens including influenza viruses and HIV-1 [38e40]. Genes are usually expressed only when and where their functions are required. Application of cDNA microarray technology to study the differences between host responses in mice infected with different pathogens provides an opportunity to identify host proteins essential for different pathogens, that could lead to the better understanding of host-pathogen interactions, the identification of virulence-associated genes at the gene transcription level, and the identification of new biomarkers for early diagnosis and design of novel therapeutic agents.",

By determining the pattern of gene expression with different pathogens, it is possible to elucidate which set of host genes are impacted at what stage of the infection with which pathogen. In this study, the host gene expression profiles in spleens of mice infected with two different respiratory pathogens (influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae) were explored using cDNA microarray technology. We have identified 490 known and unknown genes that were differentially transcribed in mouse spleen in response to infections with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae at day 1 and day 7 after infection, 285 were known genes, 76 were ESTs with GeneID and 129 were ESTs without GeneID. We found that many genes associated with cell metabolisms, intracellular signaling pathways, and gene/protein expression regulations were up-regulated or down-regulated in mice after infection. Among the 490 identified genes, some were exclusively up-regulated or down-regulated in response to only one of the two pathogens and some were shared by two pathogens. Our results demonstrated that host response to these two pathogens is very quick and gene expression profiles could be detected as early as 1 day after exposure to pathogens. We also found that 129 unknown genes were differentially expressed in mouse spleen after infection with influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. It will be important to study these 129 unknown genes to characterize their functions in host response to respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae.",

Most of these commonly up-regulated genes are involved in metabolisms and have not been linked to host responses to respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus A and S. pneumoniae. The group of commonly down-regulated genes include thioredoxin interacting protein gene (Txnip), ribosomal protein L32 gene (Rpl32), block of proliferation 1 gene (Bop1), cyclin D binding myb-like transcription factor 1 gene (Dmtf1), attractin gene (Atrn), ribosomal protein S19 gene (Rps19), cyclin I gene (Ccni), pyruvate kinase gene (Pkm2) and putative serine/threonine kinase gene (Prkx).

Recently, Kash et al. performed microarray analysis on lung tissues isolated from mice infected with a recombinant influenza A/WSN/33 virus expressing HA and NA genes of the 1918 pandemic virus (1918HA/NA:WSN), WSN and nonlethal New Caledonia HA/NA:WSN recombinant virus to compare microarray profiles [12] . Their results showed activation of many genes involved in the inflammatory response including cytokine genes. We decided to compare their results with the genes identified in this study to determine if there is any overlap between the two studies. In that paper, Kash et al. listed 102 genes (65 genes with names and 37 ESTs) without giving GeneID from mice infected with three different viruses at 24 h post infection: 1918HA/NA:WSN (lethal), WSN (lethal) and New Caledonia HA/NA:WSN (nonlethal). We have focused on the 65 genes with names and known functions and compared them with genes identified in mice infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 at day 1 from our study. Among the 18 genes preferentially regulated in mice infected with all three influenza virus infections (1918HA/ NA:WSN, WSN and New Caledonia HA/NA:WSN), we have found 10 genes with the same name or similar functions (55.6%) that were also preferentially regulated in mice infected with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 at day 1 in our study. The 10 overlap genes are: activating transcription factor 7 interacting protein (Atf3), apoptosis inhibitor survivin (Birc5), cell division cycle 2 homolog A (Cdc2a), glutathione synthetase (Gss), glutathione S-transferase pi2 (Gstp2), hemoglobin alpha adult chain 1 (Hba-a1), cell adhesion molecules integrin beta 1 (Itgb1), cell adhesion molecules integrin beta 4 (Itgb4), phospholipase c neighboring (Png) and solute carrier family 28 member 2 (Slc28a2). These 10 genes are probably common to both pathogenic and nonpathogenic H1N1 influenza A viruses such as A/South Carolina/1/18 (H1N1), A/Brevig Mission/1/18 (H1N1), A/WSN/33 (H1N1), A/New Caledonia/20/ 99 (H1N1) and A/PR/8/34 (H1N1).",

These two genes are cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor 2 (Cpsf2) and tumor necrosis factor (Tnf). We suggest that these two genes are important for pathogenesis of lethal strains of influenza A viruses.
