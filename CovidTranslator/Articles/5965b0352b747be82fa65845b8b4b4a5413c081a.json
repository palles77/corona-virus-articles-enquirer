The role of NKG2D-mediated augmentation in the clearance of central nervous system viral infections has not been explored. Using the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus model, the authors found that NKG2D-positive CD8+ cytotoxic T cells enter the brain, that NKG2D ligands are expressed in the brain during acute infection, and that interruption of NKG2D ligand recognition via treatment with a functionblocking antibody attenuates the efficacy of viral clearance from the central nervous system.

Despite the fact that members of this family infect more humans than any other group of viruses (Rotbart, 2002) , host factors that control picornaviral replication are poorly understood. Even less is known about host factors that control picornaviral neurovirulence and clearance of picornaviruses from the central nervous system (CNS) . We and others have used the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) as a mouse model of picornavirus infection of the CNS Jin et al, 2007; Rubio et al, 2006; Tsunoda et al, 2006) . Previous studies have extensively characterized the role of antiviral CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the clearance of TMEV from the brain during acute infection (Mendez-Fernandez et al, 2003) , and it is clear in mice of the H-2 b major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I haplotype that CTLs specific for the VP2 121\u2212130 TMEV peptide are responsible for viral clearance during the first 2 weeks of CNS infection (Myoung et al, 2007) . However, the role of additional host factors such as costimulatory molecules has not been thoroughly explored.",

Brain-infiltrating leukocytes (BILs) were isolated from mice at 3 (A-C) and 7 (D-F) days postinfection (dpi) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The number of CD45 hi CD8 + cells increased between 3 (A) and 7 (D) dpi. Likewise, the number of CD45 hi cells positive for both CD8 and NKG2D increased from 20% at 3 dpi (B) to 76% at 7 dpi (E). Moreover, the intensity of NKG2D surface labeling increased from a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of 35 at 3 dpi (shaded histogram in C) to 89 at 7 dpi (shaded histogram in F). The MFI for the isotype control was 4 at 3 dpi (open histogram in C) and 5 at 7 dpi (open histogram in F). BILs were further analyzed for antiviral specificity by costaining with an MHC class I tetramer loaded with the VP2 121\u2212130 H-2D b -specific viral peptide (G-I). Of the cells that were both CD8 + and tetramer-positive (box \"H\" in G), 81% were also NKG2D-positive, with an MFI of 136 (H). In contrast, only 12% of cells that were CD8 + but tetramer-negative (box \"I\" in G) were also NKG2D-positive, with an MFI of only 18 (I). the CNS at 3 and 7 days after TMEV infection (2 \u00d7 10 5 plaque-forming units [PFU] intracerebrally [i.c.]; 4-to 6-week-old C57Bl/6J mice; all experiments adhered to Mayo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee [IACUC] guidelines).

Thus, between 3 and 7 d.p.i., the phenotype of immune cells infiltrating the CNS shifted toward a population that was enriched in NKG2D + CD8 + CD45 hi CTLs ( Figure 1A to F). The presence of NKG2D-positive CTLs within the infected hippocampus (Wada and Fujinami, 1993) was confirmed by simultaneously immunostaining cryosections from mice at 7 d.p.i. with anti-CD8 (53-6.7; 1:100) and anti-NKG2D (CX5; 1:50) (Figure 2A to E) (Howe et al, 2004) .",

            "text": "139-NK; 1:10). Likewise, we attempted to confirm the expression of the NKG2D ligands at the protein level within the hippocampus by Western blot analysis of hippocampal lysates. Of the numerous antibodies tested (same as immunostaining, above), only the anti-H60 antibody (clone 205326; 1:100; R&D Systems) successfully identified a prominent band that was present within the hippocampus only after infection and which was also present in lysate from the YAC1 NK cell target line ( Figure 3B ). The apparent molecular weight of this prominent band (ca. 50 kDa) matches that described by Hasan and colleagues (Hasan et al, 2005) . The relative difference in mobility between the putative H60 band in the hippocampal lysate and the YAC-1 cell lysate may reflect differential expression of one of the three recently identified isoforms of H60 that share high sequence homology but differ in molecular weight (Takada et al, 2008) . We conclude that NKG2D ligands such as H60 are upregulated at both the transcriptional and translational level within the hippocampus following acute TMEV infection, but we are unable to identify the cells that express these ligands with the currently available immunologic tools. Finally, we asked whether interruption of NKG2Dmediated recognition of NKG2D ligands was sufficient to alter viral load within the hippocampus. We used the CX5 function blocking antibody following a therapeutic regime adapted from Lanier and colleagues (100 \u03bcg/mouse intraperitoneally [i.p.] on \u22121, +1, and +4 d.p.i.; kindly provided by Dr. Lanier, University of California San Fransisco) . Control mice received an equivalent dose of polyclonal rat immunoglobulin G (IgG) . Plaque assay (Pavelko et al, 1998) of freshly excised brain homogenates at 7 d.p.i. revealed that CX5 treatment led to 9 \u00b1 2 times more infectious virus as compared to control IgG-treated mice (U(5, 5) = 15, P = .008, Mann-Whitney rank sum test; mean \u00b1 95% CI) ( Figure 3C ). Based on these observations, we propose that VP2-specific CTLs expressing NKG2D recognize NKG2D ligands such as Rae1 and H60 expressed on infected cells within the brain and thereby engage an enhanced cytotoxic response (Markiewicz et al, 2005 ) that contributes to the clearance of picornaviruses from the CNS.",

We chose to specifically focus on the role of NKG2D on antiviral CTLs because the number of NKCs present within the brain during the peak of viral clearance is low compared to CTLs (ca. 10% of CD45 hi cells are NK1.1-positive at 7 d.p.i.; data not shown). However, we certainly cannot rule out a role for NKC-mediated recognition of NKG2D ligands on infected neural cells as part of an early response required for viral clearance. Likewise, NKG2D is expressed by subpopulations of CD4 T cells (Saez-Borderias et al, 2006) , \u03b3 \u03b4 T cells (Dandekar et al, ",
