The rotavirus often produces diarrhea in children, but the local multiplication of enteroviruses and (possibly) hepatitis A virus in cells lining the area rarely produces local symptoms, i.e., diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Because of this difference, the concept of using bacteria, e.g., coliforms and fecal streptococci, as indicators of viruses in the environment has been a very attractive one. Unfortunately the response of viruses to wastewater treatment and their behavior in the environment are very different from those of bacteria. Thus, Goyal et al. (1979) provided data to indicate that current bacteriological standards for determining the safety of shellfish and shellfish-growing waters do not reflect the occurrence of enteroviruses.
