Electron microscopy analysis of the virus particles showed that they have an envelope and surface spikes resembling those of EBOV and a particle size and shape resembling those of HPIV3. When HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP was inoculated via apical surface of an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium, the virus was released from the apical surface; when applied to basolateral surface, the virus infected basolateral cells but did not spread through the tissue. Following intranasal (IN) inoculation of guinea pigs, scattered infected cells were detected in the lungs by immunohistochemistry, but infectious HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP could not be recovered from the lungs, blood, or other tissues. Despite the attenuation, the virus was highly immunogenic, and a single IN dose completely protected the animals against a highly lethal intraperitoneal challenge of guinea pigadapted EBOV.",

Multiple initial attempts to develop vaccines against EBOV were unsuccessful, suggesting that protective immunity against EBOV is not easily achievable. During the past decade, however, vector approaches for the development of vaccines against EBOV using adenoviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), human parainfluenza type 3 (HPIV3), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus replicons have resulted in dramatic advances in vaccine development; nonetheless, no approved vaccine against EBOV exists so far (reviewed in Collins and Bukreyev, 2007) . EBOV is transmitted by contact of infected fluids or tissues with mucosal membranes or breaks in the skin (Geisbert and Jahrling, 2004; Jaax et al., 1995; Jaax et al., 1996) ; in addition, infection has been demonstrated in non-human primates by aerosol administration of the virus . Thus, the development of a vaccine that induces a strong local immune response in the respiratory tract in addition to systemic immunity would be advantageous.",

            "text": "We previously developed a topical respiratory tract vaccine against EBOV based on human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3), which is a common pediatric respiratory pathogen (reviewed in Karron and Collins, 2007) . This involved modifying complete infectious HPIV3 by adding an additional transcription cassette expressing EBOV GP. The resulting virus, HPIV3/EboGP, efficiently infected guinea pigs and nonhuman primates, induced strong systemic and local immune responses in the respiratory tract, and conferred a high level of protection against an intraperitoneal (IP) challenge with EBOV Bukreyev et al., 2006) . However, evaluation of various human adenovirus type 5 and vaccinia virus-vectored vaccines Casimiro et al., 2003; Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Kanesa-Thasan et al., 2000; Lemckert et al., 2005; Sharpe et al., 2001; Sumida et al., 2004; Zhi et al., 2006) , including an adenovirus-vectored vaccine against EBOV (Yang et al., 2003) , in animal models and in clinical studies demonstrated that preexisting immunity to the vector can abolish or greatly reduce the immunogenicity of the expressed foreign antigen. This also is a potential concern for an HPIV3-based vaccine, given the high seroprevalence for HPIV3 due to natural exposure. This concern has been somewhat ameliorated by the recent observation that, while the replication of HPIV3/EboGP indeed was strongly restricted in guinea pigs that had been previously infected with HPIV3, the immunogenicity of the EBOV GP insert was not greatly affected (Yang et al., 2008) . However, it is not unusual for studies in small experimental animals to provide overly optimistic vaccine efficacy data, and these results remain to be confirmed in a non-human primate model (Geisbert et al., 2002) . Thus, it would be useful to modify the HPIV3 vector to reduce its sensitivity to restriction by preexisting immunity.",

In contrast, HPIV3 has two transmembrane envelope surface proteins, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) that mediates receptor attachment, and the fusion protein (F) that is responsible for membrane fusion (Collins and Crowe, 2007) . Since HPIV3 HN and F are the sole neutralization antigens of HPIV3, we explored the possibility of developing a chimeric virus that lacked HPIV3 HN and F and instead contained EBOV GP as the sole surface protein combined with the internal proteins of HPIV3. In the present study we report the successful recovery of such a chimeric virus, HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/ EboGP. We have characterized the viral particles by electron microscopy, confirmed the constellation of virion proteins expressed in infected cells, tested the ability of the virus to grow in various cell lines, determined the effect of HPIV3-specific neutralizing antibodies on growth in vitro, and tested the effect of GP on the polarity of vector infection in human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE). Finally, using the guinea pig model, we have determined the extent of virus replication, the organ distribution, and the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of this vaccine virus against EBOV challenge in vivo.",

EBOV GP is a type I transmembrane protein that has an unusually short C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (CT) KFVF (Sanchez et al., 1993) that bears no sequence similarity to the much longer 23 amino acid C-terminal CT of the type I HPIV3 F protein (Spriggs et al., 1986) , or the 31 amino acid N-terminal CT of the type II HPIV3 HN protein (Elango et al., 1986) . The efficiency of incorporation of a foreign glycoprotein into a virus particle can be influenced by its CT, such that replacement of the foreign CT with that from an endogenous glycoprotein can increase incorporation (Tao et al., 2000) . Therefore, we also designed a second virus, HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGPct, in which the CT of EBOV GP in HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP was replaced with that of HPIV3 F protein (Fig. 1A , C). Both new chimeric constructs conformed to the \"rule of six\" (i.e., each genome length was an even multiple of six nucleotides), and both were designed so that the hexamer spacing of transcription signals was conserved (i.e., the first and last genes, N and L, initiate at the second hexamer nucleotide while all other genes initiate at the first hexamer nucleotide) (Kolakofsky et al., 1998) .",

HAE preparations from multiple donors were inoculated with HPIV3, HPIV3/EboGP , or HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP at an MOI of 2 PFU/cell via the apical or basolateral surface. We note that, due to the structure of these particular culture supports, inoculation of the basolateral surface also exposed the apical surface to virus. At days 2 and 4 post inoculation, the cultures were fixed and viral antigens were detected in histological cross-sections using antibodies against virion preparations of HPIV3 (Fig. 5 B and C) or EBOV (Fig. 5 , A, D and E). Following apical inoculation with HPIV3 ( Fig. 5B , left side), mostly ciliated epithelial cells were positive for virus antigen, consistent with previous findings (Zhang et al., 2005) .

These experiments demonstrated that, following apical inoculation, all three viruses were detected in the apical compartment at all of the time points tested, although HPIV3/EboGP was somewhat attenuated compared to HPIV3, and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP was even further attenuated. This difference was generally consistent with the number of viruspositive cells that were observed on days 2 and 4 in the experiment shown in Fig. 5 . In contrast, virus was not detected at the basolateral side following apical inoculation (not shown). When inoculation was by the basolateral route and samples were collected from the apical surface, the titers of HPIV3 and HPIV3/EboGP rapidly increased to high titers by day 3, indicative of robust viral replication and shedding from the apical surface, whereas replication and shedding of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP was barely detectable. These titers presumably reflect exposure of the apical cells to the viruses. With basolateral collection, intermediate viral titers (~ 4 log 10 PFU/ml) were detected for each of the three viruses only on day 1, with little or no virus at later time points. We note that there are several aspects specific to inoculation of the basolateral surface that probably enhanced the retention of the initial inoculum at that surface, namely: the basal cells are not tightly coupled, the 30-40 \u03bcm polytetrafluoroethylene support underlying the basal surface likely reduced the efficiency of the wash, and only a single wash was performed. Thus, the titers on day 1 likely reflect residual inoculum, rather than de novo virus replication. Taken together, these data suggest that the presence of EBOV GP as a sole envelope protein in the HPIV3 virions resulted in a limited infection of both the apical and basolateral surfaces of HAE, with shedding detectable from the apical surface but not the basolateral surface.",

The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, and residual infectivity was determined by plaque titration. The titers of infectious HPIV3 determined for the samples that contained or lacked HPIV3-neutralizing serum were <2.5 PFU (no residual infectivity detected) and 1.4x10 3 PFU, respectively, indicating that HPIV3 was completely neutralized by the antibodies, as expected, whereas the control had an approximately 10-fold reduction that might reflect a non-specific effect of the incubation and the presence of complement. In contrast, the titers of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP from samples that contained or lacked HPIV3-neutralizing serum were 7.0x10 2 PFU and 5.0x10 2 PFU, respectively, indicating a lack of sensitivity of the virus to HPIV3-specific antibodies. This also was confirmed during multi-cycle growth in cell culture (not shown), where the inclusion of anti-HPIV3 antibodies in the medium overlay at a dilution of 1:100 completely restricted the replication of HPIV3 with no effect on HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP.

With HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP, viral antigen was detected in various parts of the lungs, but the number of cells involved was very low. Fig 8F shows an example of a lung tissue section positive for viral antigen: one focus of positive staining is present in the alveoli, but an adjacent bronchus is negative. In addition, examination of kidneys, liver, thymus, salivary glands, and mediastinal, mesenteric and popliteal lymph nodes revealed no histopathological changes or antigen for any of the three viruses (data not shown).

This might occur, for example, if the HPIV3 internal proteins common to HPIV3 and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP induced significant protective immunity effective against the latter virus. Also, we tested a lower dose of the vaccine in order to compare the response with that after immunizations with greater doses used in the previous experiments. Guinea pigs were mock-infected (4 animals) or infected (5 animals) IN with 1x10 5 PFU of HPIV3. Forty-nine days later, serum samples were collected and analyzed for HPIV3-specific HAI antibodies, and all of the animals were infected IN with 4x10 4 PFU of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP (Table 1) . Twenty eight and 56 days later, serum samples were taken and analyzed for EBOV-specific ELISA serum antibodies. The mean log 2 titers of EBOVspecific antibodies were only slightly (less than 3-fold) reduced in HPIV3-immune group, compared to HPIV3-naive animals, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups at either time point, which is similar to the results that we recently described for HPIV3/ EboGP (Yang et al., 2008) .",

Following challenge, clinical observation and weighing of the animals were performed daily (Fig. 10A) . The challenge resulted in weight loss in the HPIV3-immunized control animals starting at day 3, which was followed by the appearance of clinical signs of EBOV infection starting at days 3 -5 (the clinical scoring is described in the legend to Fig. 10 ).

This was done to address the possibility that compatibility of the CT of GP with the internal proteins of the HPIV3 particle might be important for the efficient production of infectious particles, as we had previously observed in a study where the HN and F glycoproteins of HPIV3 were replaced with those of HPIV2 (Tao et al., 2000) . However, in the present study, this modification reduced rather than increased the efficiency of production of infectious virus and was not further pursued.

For example, in Sendai virus, mutations that conferred the ability to bud from the basolateral surface of the respiratory epithelium contributed to systemic disease that was not associated with the wild type virus, which buds from the apical surface (Tashiro et al., 1992) . HPIV3, which causes highly localized infections in the respiratory airways, replicates primarily in the apical cells on the luminal surface of the respiratory epithelium, a phenotype that was recapitulated during infection of HAE in vitro as shown here and in previous work (Zhang et al., 2005) . In contrast, Marburg virus, a closely related filovirus, is released from the basolateral membranes of infected polarized epithelial cells, even though its GP protein expressed alone or in the context of viral infection is predominately transported to the apical surface (Sanger et al., 2001) . The presence of EBOV GP as the sole surface protein in HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP thus had the potential to change the budding phenotype or tissue tropism of the vector. This possibility was investigated here using a well characterized in vitro model of polarized mucocilliary HAE (Pickles et al., 1998) . The presence of EBOV GP in HPIV3/EboGP and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP appeared to confer the ability to infect cells of the basolateral surface when applied directly to that surface, albeit inefficiently, whereas HPIV3 did not detectably infect the basolateral surface. However, expression of EBOV GP did not confer the ability to spread from infected apical cells to underlying cells. Whether HAE were infected on the apical or basolateral surface, virus release from the basolateral surface appeared to be insignificant. In addition, in guinea pigs inoculated by the IN route, the presence of EBOV GP in HPIV3/ \u0394F-HN/EboGP or HPIV3/EboGP did not result in a detectable systemic infection. The VP40 (matrix) protein of Marburg virus was recently found to contribute to the basolateral budding of the virus by retargeting the GP protein from the apical to the basolateral membrane (Kolesnikova et al., 2007) . In the HPIV3 backbone lacking EBOV VP40, this interaction would be lacking and presumably was not supplemented by the internal HPIV3 proteins; indeed, EBOV GP accumulated primarily at the apical surface of HAE. This is consistent with a previous report for Marburg virus (Sanger et al., 2001) . Interestingly, the accumulation of GP was localized in the cilia.",

This vaccine virus replicated 100-to 1000-fold less efficiently than the VSV parent in vitro, although given the high efficiency of replication inherent in the parental VSV backbone, vaccine manufacture would still be feasible. A single IM inoculation of cynomolgus macaques with 10 7 PFU of this VSV-based chimera resulted in a transient viremia in most animals based on virus isolation, did not induce detectable neutralizing serum antibodies in any animal (which became detectable after the challenge), but conferred complete protection in all animals against IM challenge with 1,000 PFU of EBOV (Jones et al., 2005) . HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP appeared to be substantially more attenuated than the VSV-based construct based on the lack of recoverable vaccine virus in any of the guinea pigs, an experimental animal that is permissive for HPIV3 and EBOV. Despite this high degree of attenuation, a single dose of 4x10 5 or 4x10 6 PFU of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP induced EBOVneutralizing serum antibodies in 5 of 6 and 6 of 6 animals, respectively, and was completely protective against an IP EBOV challenge, as already noted. IM immunization with 4x10 6 PFU of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP induced EBOV-neutralizing serum antibodies in 3 of 6 animals, indicating that the vaccine was substantially more immunogenic by the IN route.

First, HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP had a nearly 2-fold greater incorporation of GP into the particle, as compared to HPIV3/EboGP. This presumably was due to a lack of competition with HN and F for packaging. The absence of HN and F as competing antigens, and the presence of GP in ordered spikes resembling those of a filovirus particle, also might provide for increased immunogenicity. Second, because HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP lacks the HPIV3 HN and F neutralization antigens, it should be more resistant than HPIV3/EboGP to pre-existing immunity against HPIV3. We previously found that, in guinea pigs, immunity to HPIV3 from prior infection completely blocked the replication of a subsequent dose of HPIV3/ EboGP (Yang et al., 2008) . Interestingly, in this previous study, the HPIV3/EboGP-borne GP retained much of its immunogenicity despite the lack of detectable replication by the vector (Yang et al., 2008) , but we note that immunogenicity in HPIV3-immune non-human primates and humans remains to be determined. Thus, HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP provides an alternative should pre-existing immunity to the HPIV3 vector be a problem. Third, HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP is very highly attenuated, as already noted, and thus should be very safe. Taken together, these data provide a strong case for pursuing HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP (in parallel with HPIV3/EboGP) as a vaccine candidate for respiratory immunization against EBOV and warrants testing in nonhuman primates.",

They were constructed from a previously-described full-length cDNA encoding HPIV3/EboGP , which consists of the complete HPIV3 backbone in which a transcription cassette containing the ORF for EBOV GP flanked by HPIV3-specific gene-start (GS) and gene-end (GE) transcription signals was inserted between the HPIV3 P and M genes (Fig. 1A) . The F and HN genes were deleted from HPIV3/EboGP as follows (Fig. 1B) : First, the construct was modified by insertion of a StuI site into the downstream non-coding region of the HN gene between the open reading frame (ORF) and the gene-end transcriptional signal (Fig. 1B) . This was done by replacing the XhoI -SphI fragment of the HPIV3/EboGP cDNA (both sites are unique and located at positions 9,519 and 13,339, respectively) with the corresponding fragment from the previously-constructed plasmid p3/7(131)2G-Stu (Durbin et al., 2000) , which contains a full-length cDNA of HPIV3 in which three point mutations had been introduced to create the above-mentioned StuI site (Durbin et al., 2000) . This replacement resulted in the plasmid HPIV3/EboGP-StuI. Next, we used PCR to amplify and modify nucleotides 5506 -6899 of HPIV3/EboGP cDNA, a segment that spans the M ORF, so as to introduce a StuI site three nucleotides downstream of the M ORF. This was done using the forward primer ATTTCTTGCTGCAGCGATGG (positions 5506 -5525 of HPIV3/EboGP) and the reverse primer GATAGGCCTTTACTAGTTCCATTGTTTGA (the underlined sequence in the primer is complementary to the downstream end of the M ORF and the StuI site is in bold). This PCR product was digested with PflM1 (an endogenous site present at at nucleotides 5537-5547 in the GP gene of HPIV3/EboGP) and StuI and cloned into the PflMI-StuI window of HPIV3/ EboGP-StuI. This deleted the F and HN genes and created the full-length HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/ EboGP cDNA. Construction of the cDNA encoding HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGPct, in which the cytoplasmic tail (CT) of the GP protein was replaced with that of HPIV3 F (Fig. 1C) , was performed as follows: The pGem-5Zf cloning vector (Promega Inc., Madison, WI) was modified to remove its BfuA1 and Mlu1 restriction sites by replacing the SpeI-NsiI fragment, containing the two sites, with an irrelevant SpeI-NsiI fragment lacking the sites, resulting in the plasmid pGem-5Zf/Spe-Nsi1. Next the NcoI-NcoI fragment of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP (positions 3,734-6,252, which includes the downstream end of the EBOV GP gene) was cloned into the unique NcoI site of the plasmid pGem-5Zf/SpeI-NsiI, resulting in the plasmid pGem-5Zf/EboGP/NcoI-NcoI. We then amplified the coding sequence for the HPIV3 F gene CT by PCR using primers that added EBOV sequence and cloning sites on either end. The forward primer was GACAATGGATACCGGCAGGTATTGGAGTTACAGGCGTTGTAATTGCAGTTATC GCTTTATTCTGTATATGCAAGTATTACAGAATTCAAAA (the underlined sequence encodes the upstream end of the HPIV3 F CT, the remainder encodes the TM of EBOV GP, and a naturally-occurring BfuAI recognition sequence is italicized) and the reverse primer TCTTAAACGCGTATTATTTGTTTGTTAGTACAT (the underlined sequence is complementary to that encoding the downstream end of the HPIV3 F CT, the remainder is downstream noncoding sequence from the EBOV GP transcription cassette, and an MluI site in the latter sequence is in bold). The PCR product was digested with MluI and BfuAI and the fragment was used to replace the corresponding MluI-BfuAI fragment of the EBOV GP segment in plasmid pGem-5Zf/EboGP/NcoI-NcoI. This replaced the CT of EBOV GP with that of HPIV3 F, resulting in the plasmid pGem-5zf/EboGP/Nco-Nco-mod. Finally, the NcoI-NcoI fragment from this plasmid-borne segment was used to replace the corresponding NcoI-NcoI fragment of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP, resulting in cDNA encoding HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGPct. The modifications in the cDNAs for HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGPct were confirmed by sequence analysis, and recombinant viruses were recovered in cell culture using previously-described methods . The recombinant HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/ EboGP virus was amplified by three passages in LLC-MK2 cells at 32\u0394C.",

Note that the envelope of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP is thinner than that of HPIV3 and contains spikes that resemble those of EBOV rather than HPIV3. Conversely, the shape of the HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP particle resembles that of HPIV3 rather than EBOV. The EBOV image was kindly provided by C. Humphrey and A. Sanchez (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA). Analysis of purified virions of HPIV3, HPIV3/EboGP, and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP by gel electrophoresis in conjunction with silver staining (A) or Western blotting using a guinea pig antiserum raised against a DNA vaccine expressing EBOV GP (B) . Lanes: 1 and 5, MagicMark XP (Invitrogen) with the corresponding molecular weights indicated to the left; 2, HPIV3; 3, HPIV3/EboGP; 4, HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP. The HPIV3 P, HN, N, F1 and M bands are identified based on published profiles (Storey, Dimock, and Kang, 1984; Wechsler et al., 1985) and the position of EBOV GP is indicated. Replication of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP in cell monolayers. A. Plaque formation in LLC-MK2 cells by HPIV3, HPIV3/EboGP and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP. The cells were incubated under methycellulose for 6 days at 32\u00b0C, fixed, and analyzed immunostaining with rabbit antiserum rraised against purified HPIV3 virions (HPIV3 panel) or purified inactivated EBOV virions (HPIV3/EboGP and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP panels). B. Growth kinetics of HPIV3, HPIV3/ EboGP and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP in LLC-MK2, Vero and A549 cells. Cells were infected at an MOI of 3 PFU/cell during a 2-h adsorption period, washed three times, and incubated at 32\u00b0C. Aliquots of the overlying medium were taken on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 and replaced with fresh medium. Viral titers in the aliquots were determined by plaque titration in LLC-MK2 cells. Mean values \u00b1 SE, based on three monolayers per virus, are shown. The limit of detection is 1.7 log 10 PFU/ml, with the exception of day 1, for which it was 0.7 log 10 PFU/ml. Note that for many time points, error bars cannot be seen due to the low variability. In LLC-MK2 and A549 cells infected with HPIV3 and HPIV3/EboGP, the monolayers were completely destroyed by day 6, and therefore medium aliquots were not collected. Data from one of the two independent experiments performed are shown. Growth kinetics of HPIV3 and HPIV3/ Infection of an in vitro model of human airway epithelium (HAE) with HPIV3 (rows A and B), HPIV3/EboGP (rows C and D), and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP (row E): selected representative cross-sectional images. HAE were inoculated from either the apical (left column) or basolateral surface (right column; note that the method used for basolateral inoculation exposed both surfaces to infection, see the text), and were fixed and analyzed by immunostaining on day 2 (HPIV3/EboGP) or day 4 (HPIV3, HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP). Viral antigen was detected with rabbit antiserum raised against purified HPIV3 virions (rows B and C) or purified, inactivated EBOV virions (rows A, D and E) as the first antibody followed by a labeled second antibody (red), and the nuclei were stained blue with DAPI. Treatment of Growth kinetics of HPIV3, HPIV3/EboGP and HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP on HAE. Triplicate HAE cultures were inoculated with viruses at an MOI of 2 PFU via the apical or basolateral and apical surfaces, viral supernatants from the apical or basolateral compartments were harvested, and viral titers were determined by plaque titration in LLC-MK2 cells. Means represent three samples per group \u00b1 SE. For the samples below the limit of detection, which was 1.7 log 10 PFU/ml, the value two-fold below the limit (1.4 log 10 PFU/ml) was assigned for calculation of the means. Immunohistochemical analysis of viral antigen distribution in guinea pig lungs on day 2 after IN infection with 4x10 5 PFU of HPIV3 (A), HPIV3/EboGP (C, D), HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP (E, F), or mock infection (B) . A, C, D, Viral antigen detected in bronchial epithelium. F, A focus of positive staining present in alveoli; an adjacent bronchiole is negative. E, Lack of viral antigen in a bronchus. Viral antigen is stained brown against a background of hematoxylin counterstain; cells positive for the antigen are shown with green arrows. Challenge with EBOV: guinea pigs were immunized IN with 4x10 5 PFU of HPIV3 (4 animals), 4x10 5 PFU of HPIV3/EboGP (4 animals), or 4x10 6 PFU of HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP (6 animals), and challenged 25 days later with 1,000 PFU of EBOV by the IP route. A. Percent change in body weight following EBOV challenge. Daily mean weights \u00b1 SE are shown expressed as a percentage of the weight on day 0. When one or more animals in a group died, the SE was calculated based on the remaining live animals, with a minimum of 3 animals per group. B. Kaplan-Maier survival curves and clinical disease scores. All of the animals immunized with HPIV3/\u0394F-HN/EboGP or HPIV3/EboGP survived, while all of the HPIV3-immunized (control) animals died. Disease signs were observed only in the control group and were scored daily for each of the four animals as follows: 1, ruffled fur, reduced activity, loss of body conditions; 2, labored breathing, hunched posture, bleeding, marked lethargy; 2+, same as 2, but extremely severe. Each row represents the daily scores for one of the four control animals in that group, ending with a vertical line on the day of death. One animal shown in the bottom was euthanized on day 9 due to severity of the disease.",
