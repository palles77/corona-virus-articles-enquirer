To improve the cabin environment, this investigation proposed an innovative ventilation system that would reduce contaminant transport and maintain thermal comfort. We manufactured and installed the proposed ventilation system in an occupied seven-row, single-aisle aircraft cabin mockup. Air velocity, air temperature, and contaminant distribution in the cabin mockup were obtained by experimental measurements. The investigation used the experimental data to validate the results of CFD simulation. The validated CFD program was then used to study the impact of the locations and number of exhausts on contaminant removal and thermal comfort in a one-row section of a fully occupied Boeing-737 cabin. Although the diffusers in the proposed system were close to the passengers' legs, the air velocity magnitude was acceptable in the lower part of the cabin and the leg area. The proposed system provided an acceptable thermal environment in the cabin, although passengers could feel cold when placing their legs directly in front of the diffusers. The four-exhaust configuration of the new ventilation system was the best, and it decreased the average exposure in the cabin by 57% and 53%, respectively, when compared with the mixing and displacement ventilation systems.",

They found that UAs could be used to accurately measure the distributions of three-dimensional airflow parameters. However, the UA sensor was too bulky for use in small areas. Cao et al. [7] performed a large-scale particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurement to characterize the mixing air distributions inside a partially transparent airliner cabin mockup. They obtained high-accuracy 2-D airflow information and found that the cabin airflows were of low velocity and high turbulence level. Li et al. [8] measured the distributions of air velocity, temperature, and tracer-gas (sulfur hexafluoride or SF 6 ) concentration in the economy-class cabin of an MD-82 airplane with gaspers on and off. The experimental results showed that gaspers in a cabin with mixing ventilation might not be useful for improving cabin air quality, even though the gaspers seemed to supply clean air directly to passengers.",

For instance, Zhang et al. [9] employed the RNG k-\u03b5 model to simulate the CO 2 distribution in a section of a Boeing 767 airliner cabin. They found that the CO 2 concentration with the mixing air distribution was fairly uniform, and the mixing air distribution system could spread infectious diseases. You et al. [10, 11] developed a consolidated turbulence model and a simplified gasper geometry model in a CFD program for predicting the airflow and contaminant transport in a cabin with gaspers. The CFD program was then used to investigate the impact of the gaspers on contaminant transport in the economy-class cabins of Boeing 767 and 737 airliner. It was found that the statistical impact of the gaspers on passengers' exposure to contaminants was neutral. Hence, the gaspers did not improve the cabin environment.",

Meanwhile, displacement ventilation systems have been widely used in buildings and have been shown to be more effective than mixing ventilation systems in removing contaminants [12] . Therefore, to reduce the transmission of airborne infectious disease viruses and/or to improve cabin air quality, new ventilation systems have been developed further from the displacement ventilation system. Schmidt et al. [13] and M\u00fcller et al. [14] compared mixing ventilation displacement ventilation systems in a section of an A320 cabin mockup. Schmidt et al. [13] found that a mixing ventilation system had higher draft risk, while a displacement ventilation system could result in \"hot heads.\" However, M\u00fcller et al. [14] suggested that a displacement ventilation system could maintain an acceptable cabin thermal environment as long as the temperature difference between the head and feet was kept in a comfortable range. Bosbach et al. [15] measured the air velocity and temperature in a single-aisle airliner cabin with mixing ventilation, displacement ventilation, and hybrid ventilation during stationary ground and flight tests in an A-320 airliner. The displacement ventilation system supplied air through the lower sidewalls of the cabin and exhausted the air near the cabin ceiling, while the hybrid ventilation was a combination of mixing and displacement ventilation. The researchers found that the mixing ventilation system had the lowest heat removal efficiency, indicating that mixing ventilation may not be efficient in controlling contaminant transport. The use of a displacement ventilation system in a cabin, meanwhile, may be efficient in controlling the contaminant transport but, it may result in poor thermal comfort.",

Individual diffusers installed on the floor under the seats would supply clean air to the passengers in the row behind, and the cabin air would be extracted at ceiling level. Such a system would not occupy much of the passengers' leg room, since the diffusers would be installed between passengers or at the ends of the rows. Clean air would first be supplied directly to the passengers, who generate heat. In the presence of thermal plumes, the air would then travel upward, carrying exhaled contaminants from the passengers to the exhausts. Therefore, the system could reduce airborne contaminant transport in comparison with traditional mixing ventilation. The passengers' feet would not be in front of the diffusers, and thus the system would not produce a draft that would jeopardize cabin thermal comfort. The system combines the advantages of under-floor air distribution and displacement ventilation.",

Since the cabin walls were not insulated, surface temperatures were also measured, by the infrared camera and thermocouples, at the floor, aisle, sidewalls, side ceilings, and ceiling center, in each row. This investigation measured air velocity, air temperature, and contaminant (tracer-gas) distributions in the cross section through the heated manikins in the fourth row (CS4). For the air velocity distribution, we used a PIV system and UAs. In the PIV measurements, a laser generator shined a laser sheet into the fourth row of the cabin mockup through the left side, and the camera was fixed In front of the second row to take high-resolution pictures. Note that the manikins in seats 2B, 3B, 2E, and 3E were removed to make room for the camera. The measuring area for each zone was 115 cm wide and 80 cm high, as shown in Fig. 3(a) . For each zone, images were collected for a period of 5 min at a frequency of 3 Hz after the cabin airflow had stabilized. The recorded images were processed and analyzed using the signal processing and cross-correlation techniques in the DynamicStudios software program to obtain the two-dimensional airflow field. Fig. 3 (b) shows the sampling points for the UA measurements. The air velocity distribution in CS4 was measured at a 0.15 m interval as represented by black dots. For measurement of the air distribution in the passengers' leg area, the section was shifted forward by 0.15 m to avoid the legs.

We used a hybrid turbulence model proposed by You et al. [11] to calculate the air distribution in airliner cabins.

A detailed description of all terms can be found in ANSYS [21] . This investigation used the SIMPLE algorithm for coupling pressure and velocity, the PRESTO! scheme for discretizing pressure, and the second-order upwind scheme for solving all the other variables. The turbulence intensity at the supply inlets was assumed to be 10%. The thermo-fluid boundary conditions, including the supply air flow rate, supply air temperature, and surface temperatures, were set according to the measured data from the experiment. The diffuser grille was made of Plexiglas because it can easily control the airflow direction, and the nine blinds in each diffuser grille directed the flow toward the breathing zone of the passenger. A fiber filter was inserted between the grille and the damper to create a stable and uniform flow. In future application, the seat legs should be adjusted so that they do not block the leg area. The air supply system was insulated. Table 1 lists the airflow rates measured by the constant tracer-gas method for each diffuser, with an average of 7.63 L/s per diffuser. The relative error for all the diffusers with the average airflow rate was 6.5% on average and 19% maximum. It was difficult to balance the flow perfectly. Fig. 6 is an example of the surface temperature distribution on the manikins as measured by an infrared camera. The image shows that the temperature was not uniform. Therefore, this investigation used the average temperature of each section. The average temperatures of the heads, chests, abdomens, thighs, and calves of all 38 manikins were 31.0, 32.3, 36.0, 34.2, and 25.4\u00b0C, respectively. 3.3.1. Air velocity distribution Fig. 7 (a) compares the air distributions in CS4 as measured by UAs, PIV, and CFD. The UA results show that the air traveled upward in the lower part of the cross section, where PIV could not measure anything because of the difficulty in shining the laser light into this region. The upward flow was maintained in this region because the air was directed obliquely upward from the supply diffusers and because of the thermal plumes generated by the manikins. Moreover, both the PIV and UA results indicate that the flow direction in the aisle was downward. The reason for the downward flow could be that the proposed ventilation system created two circulations, one on each side of the cabin.",

The reason for this difference may be that the UA system measured average velocity over a span of 3 cm in each direction, as determined by the dimensions of the UA sensor, whereas the PIV system captured the data at a specific point. Since the airflow in the cabin was extremely complex, such a difference between UA and PIV might result in the discrepancy of the measured data.

The black dots in Fig. 7(b) represent the sampling locations for the anemometer. The velocity magnitude at these locations was found to be in the range of 0.10-0.27 m/s. Therefore, the air velocity magnitude in the leg area was acceptable. Compared with the experimental data, the CFD simulations were able to capture the general trend of the air distribution and provide results with acceptable accuracy. Fig. 8 (a) and (b) show the measured temperature distribution in CS4 and in the section that crossed the leg area. Temperature stratification can be seen in CS4, and the average temperature difference between the heads and ankles was 2.5 K, with the highest difference value as shown in Fig. 8(a) . Therefore, the proposed ventilation system would provide an acceptable thermal environment in an airliner cabin. However, the temperature distribution in the occupied zone would not be as uniform as that generated by a mixing ventilation system. Furthermore, the temperature profile in CS4 was not symmetric, possibly because of slight differences in thermo-fluid and geometric conditions. In fact, the asymmetric distribution was stable. As shown in Fig. 8(b) , the temperature in the area corresponding to the diffusers was lower than that in the surrounding environment.

The contaminant removal efficiency indicates the percentage of exhaled contaminant that is prevented from traveling to the front or back rows. The higher the efficiency, the lower the contaminant concentration level will be in the front and back rows. Therefore, this investigation aimed to minimize the dimensionless exposure for passengers, and maximize the contaminant removal efficiency. Note that this parameter might not be able to fully characterize the longitudinal contaminant transport. More efforts will be made to systematically investigate the contaminant transport between rows in an aircraft cabin with the proposed ventilation system. The proposed system must also satisfy the thermal comfort requirements for cabin environments. A modified predicted mean vote for air cabins (PMVc) was used by Cui et al. [28] to evaluate the thermal comfort level. This study considered both summer and winter conditions, with the clothing levels for summer and winter assumed to be 0.57 clo and 1.01 clo [29] , respectively. The diffusers were so close to passengers that they may have created a draft. Therefore, this study used the \"percent dissatisfied\" (PD) developed by Fanger et al. [30] to predict the risk of draft. ASHRAE [31] recommends a PMV level of \u22120.5 to 0.5, and a PD within 15%. This study used the ASHRAE standards for PMV and PD as the design criteria for thermal comfort. The design domain was the occupied zone [32] shown in Fig. 10 .",

The first two systems were chosen for the purpose of comparison, for evaluation of the proposed system's ability to reduce contaminant transport. The mixing ventilation system had two linear air-supply diffusers in the center of the ceiling and one on the upper side of each wall. The exhausts were in the side walls near the floor. The displacement ventilation system supplied air through two linear diffusers on the side walls near the floor and extracted air through the ceiling center. The proposed system had three possible exhaust configurations. Fig. 11 (c) shows two exhaust slots located in the center of the ceiling, Fig. 11 (d) has two additional exhaust slots on the upper side walls, and Fig. 11 (e) another two slots under the luggage bins. The width of the exhaust was 2 mm. For all the systems, the total air supply rate was 0.047 m 3 /s for this one-row section. The supply-air temperature was 19.3\u00b0C.

Fig. 12 summarizes the distribution of dimensionless exposure he one-row section of a fully occupied economy cabin with different ventilation systems. The mixing ventilation system was less efficient in controlling the contaminant transport compared with other ventilation system, since the contaminant was more likely to transport to the other half of the cabin. For aisle and window seat sources, the proposed system provided dimensionless exposure less than 0.25. However, the exposure for passenger in seat E for window seat source was 1.52 with displacement ventilation, and that in seat E was for aisle seat source was 0.38. For middle seat, the exposure in seat D was higher than 0.4 for all ventilation systems.",

            "text": "In addition, the exposure decreased from 0.323 to 0.182 with the increase in the number of exhaust slots in the proposed system. This is because adding slots reduced air stagnation and facilitated the escape of the contaminant directly through the exhaust. The proposed system configurations with two, four, and six exhaust slots provided comparable average dimensionless exposure values: 0.128, 0.113, and 0.098, respectively. The four-exhaust system decreased the average exposure in the cabin by 57% and 53%, respectively, compared with the mixing and displacement ventilation systems. Table 3 summarizes the computed contaminant removal efficiency for the various systems. For window and middle source locations, the proposed system with four and six exhaust slots provided higher contaminant removal efficiency than the mixing and displacement ventilation systems. The proposed system with two exhausts also provided higher removal efficiency than the other two systems for the middle seat location. For the aisle seat source, however, the proposed system with all exhaust configurations provided higher efficiency than the mixing ventilation system but lower results with the displacement ventilation system. In addition, for the window seat source, the proposed system with two exhaust slots had the described performance. This is because the sources were in the stagnation zone. The proposed system with four exhaust slots had slightly better removal efficiency than that of the system with six-exhausts, while the four-exhaust system had slightly higher dimensionless exposure than the six-exhaust system. Note that the configuration of the four-exhaust system is simpler. Therefore, it is overall the best choice. The four-exhaust system increased the contaminant removal in the cabin by 2.6 times and 0.4 times, respectively, compared with the mixing and displacement ventilation systems. Fig. 13 (a) depicts the PMVc distribution in the cabin, generated by the proposed system with four exhaust slots in summer. The proposed system turned out to have similar PMVc values under summer and winter conditions with different numbers of exhaust slots. Therefore, the results for the proposed system with two slots and six slots are not presented here. The average PMVc values in the cabin under summer and winter conditions were 0.31 and 0.11, respectively. ASHRAE [28] recommends a PMV range of \u22120.5 to 0.5, and the PMVc clearly satisfied the ASHRAE standard in this cabin. To further assess the proposed system, Fig. 13 (c) and (d) show the PMVc distribution under the summer conditions with the mixing and displacement ventilation systems. The average PMVc value under the summer conditions with the proposed system (\u22120.31) was lower than that with the mixing ventilation system (\u22120.26), and higher than that with the displacement ventilation system (\u22120.41). The trend also held for the winter conditions. Thus, the proposed system has the potential to reduce energy consumption by the HVAC system when compared with the mixing ventilation system, but not in comparison with the displacement ventilation system. Fig. 13 (b) depicts the PD distribution in the cabin with the proposed system with four exhaust slots. ASHRAE [28] recommends that the PD level be within 15%, and the PD level clearly satisfied the ASHRAE standard in this section of the cabin. Although the system created a draft risk in the area near the diffuser outlets, it was only a small region within the occupied zone (1.88%). Meanwhile, Fig. 13 (d) and (f) show the PD distributions for the mixing and displacement ventilation systems. The \"dissatisfied\" zone of the design domain with the mixing and displacement ventilation systems were 9.97% and 6.64%, respectively, which were larger than that with the proposed system. This is because the two systems would generate a large vortex on each side of the cabin, resulting in a high PD level in the aisle and near the floor in the occupied zone. Thus, the proposed system was able to reduce the draft risk in the occupied zone in comparison with the other two systems. ",

The air velocity, air temperature, and contaminant distributions in the mockup were measured. It demonstrated good contaminant removal potential and acceptable thermal comfort. Despite the fact that the diffusers in the proposed system were close to the passengers' legs, the air velocity magnitude was small in the leg area and therefore would not create a draft. However, if a passenger placed his/her legs directly in front of the diffuser, he/she might feel cold.",

The validated CFD program was used to evaluate the location and number of exhausts in a one-row section of a fully occupied Boeing 737 cabin. The system configuration with four exhausts seemed to be the best choice, as it decreased the average exposure in the cabin by 57% and 53%, respectively, when compared with the mixing and displacement ventilation systems. The four-exhaust system also increased contaminant removal in the cabin by 2.6 times and 0.4 times, respectively, when compared with mixing and displacement ventilation systems. The PMVc with the proposed system was lower than that with the mixing ventilation system, but higher than that with the displacement ventilation system. ",
