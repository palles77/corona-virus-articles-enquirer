            "text": "Marek's disease in chickens is caused by an oncogenic herpesvirus [11, 30] and is associated with visceral lymphomas and neural lymphoid lesions [4, 8, 28, 31] . Most Marek's disease virus (MDV)-infected chickens have definitive brain lesions [45] that do not cause neurological clinical signs. However, MDV infection can cause a reversible encephalopathy, termed transient paralysis (TP), in certain lines of chickens [10, 18, 34, 39, 42, [46] [47] [48] . Affected birds become depressed and recumbent 8 to 12 days after either inoculation or natural exposure to the virus. Although some severely affected birds die at this time, the clinical signs usually resolve in 24 to 48 h. Most birds that have recovered from TP develop the typical visceral and neural lesions of Marek's disease 2 to 6 weeks later. The incidence of TP in farm flocks is generally quite low.",

            "text": "Susceptibility to TP is a recessive trait controlled by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes [39] . The occurrence of clinical signs probably has an immunological basis [32] . In previous descriptions of the histological lesions in brains from chickens having TP [10, 18, 34, 39, 42, [46] [47] [48] , lymphocytic perivascular cuffing was the only change consistently identified. Since lymphocytic perivascular cuffing has been identified in the brains of genetically resistant [39] and clinically recovered birds [34] , it seems likely that this is not the causative lesion of TP. In a recent light microscopic study of brain lesions in TP-susceptible and resistant lines of chickens, we made compari-sons at 11 days after MDV inoculation, when clinical signs were evident in susceptible birds, and at 17 days when these signs had remitted [19] . Brains obtained from susceptible birds at the height of clinical involvement consistently had vacuolation of both gray and ~vhite matter throughout the brain, while this lesion was not present in brains of genetically resistant or clinically recovered birds. There was apparent vasculitis in some of the clinically affected susceptible birds, suggesting that the vacuoles might have resulted, at least in part, from vasogenic brain edema. In this report, ultrastructural brain lesions occurring after MDV inoculation of TP-susceptible and TP-resistant chickens are described.",

Although the location of the intramyelinic spaces relative to myelin periodicity could not usually be defined, some appeared to be at the intraperiod line (Fig. 2B ). These intramyelinic spaces were usually relatively electron lucent, except for widely dispersed membranous debris and particulate material presumed to be precipitated protein from edema. Myelin displaced by these vacuoles often remained attached to the axon and was relatively normal morphologically, with no vesiculation. Lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages were present in affected areas. However, while there was phagocytosis of myelin ( Fig. 3 A, B) , there was no indication that these cells initiated demyelination. Few axons were completely demyelinated, Most affected axons were morphologically normal, but some were more electron lucent than normal, contained swollen mitochondria, and had discontinuous axolemmas. There were scattered axonal spheroids (Fig. 4A) and axoplasm was occasionally sequestered by inner loops of oligodendrocyte cytoplasm (Fig. 4B) . Numerous necrotic cells that were too distorted to allow definite identification of cell type were present, Some were relatively electron dense, contained large mitochondria and maloriented tubules, and had no visible filaments, suggesting that they were oligodendrocytes (Fig. 5 A) . A few more normal-appearing oligodendrocytes had vacuoles and swollen mitochondria within their cell bodies (Fig. 5 B) . Cytoplasmic processes containing swollen mitochondria, vacuoles, and amorphous material were occasionally present within dilated periaxonal spaces (Fig. 6A, B) . Many of these processes were located adjacent to the axon and appeared to be inner tongues of oligodendrocyte cytoplasm contributing to the myelin sheath (Fig. 6A) . Similar processes seen more rarely external to affected myelin sheaths may have been outer loops of oligodendrocyte cytoplasm. Some of these processes were also probably from macrophages.",

It is possible that an MDV-induced effect on astrocytes could lead to intracellular edema and subsequent intramyelinic vacuolation. It seems at least equally plausible that astrocyte distension, seen in TP-affected birds, occurred because these cells were involved in the removal of edema. Presumably, accumulation of extracellular edema could also lead to intramyelinic vacuolation, especially in young birds in which myelination is still active. However, there was often minimal, if any, expansion of the extracellular space in areas of intramyelinic vacuolation in birds of this study.",

Most of these vacuoles occur at the periphery of the myelin sheath, which seems consistent with their origin from extracellular fluid.

Apparent intramyelinic vacuoles similar to those seen in TP-affected birds were illustrated but not specifically discussed in papers describing demyelination associated with infection with the JHM corona virus [29] , vesicular stomatitis virus [13] , and Chandipura virus [14] . That intramyelinic vacuoles have been seen subsequent to JHM corona virus infection is particularly noteworthy, since oligodendrocyte injury may be involved in the pathogenesis of this condition [22, 44] . However, intramyelinic vacuolation has not been described subsequent to Theiler's virus infection [12] , even though virus-induced lysis of oligodendrocytes may be responsible for demyelination [37] . While intramyelinic vacuolation is not a common feature of experimental allergic encephalitis, large intramyelinic vacuoles similar to those seen in TP-affected birds have been reported in association with neuronal and glial cell death [24] .",

Most of the lymphocytes within perivascular spaces were probably simply migrating extravascularly, as has been reported previously in MDV-inoculated, TP-resistant chickens [25] . There was no separation of endothelial cell tight junctions or marked vessel wall distortion to suggest vasculitis. However, there was evidence of increased pinocytotic activity in TP-affected birds compared to uninoculated controls. While studies using electrondense markers would be needed to provide definite proof, this increase in pinocytosis suggests that the blood-brain barrier may also be altered in TP-affected birds. Such an increase in vascular permeability could be the source of the intramyelinic and astrocytic edema seen in these birds.",
