The major purpose of this article is to theoretically demonstrate that the Chinese government's intervention in large-scale infectious diseases is successful and efficient. Two potential strategies were considered: strategy 1 was infectious disease without government intervention, and strategy 2 was infectious disease with government intervention. By evolution model, this article illustrates the efficiency of big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. Without government reimbursement, this article finds that high expenditures accelerate the disease infection. The number of infected persons decreases under big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China. The higher the treatment costs, the more important the government intervention. Big infectious disease reimbursement policy in China can serve as an efficient example to cope with big infectious diseases.",

According to statistics, 5327 residents in mainland China were infected with SARS, of which 349 died. Besides, 1755 cases were reported in Hong Kong, China, of which 300 infected people died. At the same time, 665 cases were infected in Taiwan, China, of which 180 died, and the death rate was about 10.7%. It is well known that China is a country with large population. Due to high population density, high mobility, and poor sanitation in some areas, SARS had spread rapidly. Although these conditions were conducive to the spread of SARS, the Chinese government took a compulsory means to control it. As soon as an infected person was identified, mandatory isolation and free treatment were provided to stop transmission and reduce mortality, which is the key for the infectious disease defense being successful",

According to experts, this is probably the worst flu in the United States in decades, which is comparable to the 2009 peak of swine flu. According to the statistics of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 4064 people across the country died from flu and pneumonia just in the third week of 2018, which is 10% of the mortality rate in the same period in the United States. And the situation is still deteriorating because the death toll is rising. During the swine flu in 2009 and 2010, a total of 60.8 million Americans were infected, 274 000 were hospitalized, and about 12 500 died. The death toll from the ongoing flu may far exceed this number. In the United States, even if the flu outbreak is not so severe, about 12 000 people are expected to die. If it is severe, the death toll may reach 56 000, of which 80% are elderly. The main reason for the high infection and deaths due to flu in the United States may be attributed to the nonfeasance of government because took no effective measures were taken against the spread of the infectious disease.",

On the other hand, the United States has the best medical conditions in the world. But the statistics data above show that the damage caused by infectious diseases in the United States is far serious than that in China. Even though the flu in the United States is much milder than SARS in China, there are still tens of thousands of people dying due to infectious diseases in the United States, but during SARS, the death toll in China was no more than 829. In comparison, the number of deaths from infectious diseases in the United States is at least 10 times that due to infectious diseases in China.

Under this condition, the evolution number of the 3 groups is shown in Figure 3 . Figure 3 shows that the number of infected people drops rapidly and will reach zero in the eighth period. Besides, according to Figure 3 , we learn that only 5.59 people need treatment under full government subsidy, much less than that under no government intervention. But the total cost of treatment is related to unit person treatment cost, which is 55.88 at high cost and 27.94 at low cost. (These exact numbers themselves have no meaning; they are only used to show the gap between different conditions.) Figure 3 shows that when the cost of treatment is high, the expenditures of implementing the full compensation mechanism are also high.",

The higher the treatment costs, the more important the government intervention. The conclusions of this article offer theoretical support to control big infectious diseases. Moreover, for emerging infectious diseases, uncertainty yields high treatment expenditures and the government should establish complete reimbursement policy to control these diseases. However, the limitation of this article is lack of data verification of medical expenditures about big infectious disease from China and the United States.
