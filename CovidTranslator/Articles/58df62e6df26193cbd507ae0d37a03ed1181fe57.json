It has been noted in this study and others that the rhesus rotavirus vaccine may cause side effects similar to natural rotavirus infection and therefore must be given at 100-to 1,000-fold lower infective doses than the bovine vaccine. This has led Vesikari et al (24) to conclude that the bovine strain may be overattenuated and the rhesus rotavirus vaccine too underattenuated for use in humans.",

Whether these would be superior to the RIT 4237 bovine rotavirus vaccine or the rhesus rotavirus vaccine remains to be determined. Clearly, a successful rotavirus vaccine needs to be effective with the population groups at greatest risk for developing severe rotavirus illness, i.e., infants and young children in developing countries. As to the present vaccine situation, sufficient reports are available to conclude that the bovine RIT 4237 and the rhesus rotavirus vaccines are effective in preventing severe rotavirus diarrhea (but not necessarily infection) in developed, temperate zone countries but that no vaccine has as yet been shown to be effective in developing countries. The workload recording method devised by the College of American Pa-thologists (CAP) is the system used in most clinical laboratories (I). With increasing attention being given to costeffectiveness, administrators have become interested in comparing productivity between laboratories and even between divisions within laboratories.",

Furthermore, anyone who has performed any research knows that these values must represent means and we are given no information about the range of observations or standard deviations. CAP should make available to interested parties at a fair price a complete compendium of workload measurements that have been taken to establish these unit values. This information should include the number of institutions studied, something about the type and size of the institutions, the numbers of measurements, and the standard deviations. Many of us have submitted scientific data for publication that have included mean values, and their significance has been established by calculation of standard deviations with expressions of statistical significance attached to differences in means. Scientific journals would not accept such studies with only mean values stated. For example, CAP allows 5.1 units for a Gram-stained direct smear. If I conduct timings in my laboratory following CAP instructions and I obtain a mean value of 4.8 minutes, is this statistically significantly different from the 5.1 unit value recommended by CAP? I cannot determine this without knowing something about the range of values that they have observed. Unfortunately, the inability to obtain this information fosters lingering concern among many of us that the number of measurements taken may be small and the range very large.",

CAP depends on \"volunteers\" to collect data. While they may use volunteers for this purpose, they employ professional computing services and biological manufacturers for processing and distributing of specimens and data for the survey program. I believe it to be a correct statement that the income from the survey program is used to support other CAP activities and could be channeled into the workload recording program. Many of us wonder whether those who volunteer to collect workload data in their laboratories may be the ones who are most able to afford the time to do it and that this may bias their timings to be longer than those that might be collected in the laboratories whose staffs are more pushed. I believe that selection of laboratories for timing studies should be based on a careful statistical approach to a proper cross section of clinical laboratories of all types and sizes. This would likely include many types of laboratories from whom data would not be collected on a volunteer basis. We have worked with our own management engineering consultants and have performed our own timing studies. Accurate timing is not simple and should be done by those who are properly trained. CAP could send well-trained paid timers into selected laboratories. The American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) has conducted its own timing studies. These data have been collected in accord with CAP guidelines and have been accepted by CAP. There is the general impression that AABB has become better satisfied with the system as applied to blood banking. A number of us have suggested that the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) initiate this same type of program.",

Data are returned to those participants so that they can compare their productivity with other laboratories and with a national mean, but these data are not available to those who do not subscribe to the program, nor are they published. CAP contends that making the data public would discourage subscription to their program. Quite the reverse may be true. Publication of their data could heighten awareness among the laboratory community of the levels and differences in productivity being observed and might stimulate wider participation. Unfortunately the data are widely available through unofficial channels and are well known to consulting firms that are often hired by hospital administrators to evaluate the productivity of their laboratories. The American Hospital Association has distributed workload recording data for many years through their \"Monitrend\" program to member hospitals that subscribe. At one time, these data were based on CAP units collected by hospital accounting departments, which often did not include units generated by control work and repeat testing and were often incomplete in other respects due to lost billings. The accuracy of these data may have improved, but laboratorians should continue to be cautious about such data being used by administrators.",

I have observed laboratories displaying comparable levels of CAP productivity (CAP units of work performed/paid or worked hours expended), but some of these laboratories have processed almost twice as many bacteriologic specimens as others showing comparable CAP productivity. The explanation is clear when the profiles of these laboratories for CAP units expended per specimen are examined. The laboratorians processing twice as many specimens perform half as much work. These laboratorians use fewer plates and tubes and expend less work when including susceptibility testing multiple organisms are isolated. This is not the place to debate which laboratorians are right, but the observation clearly illustrates that there are two aspects to expression of productivity in the bacteriology laboratory.",

            "text": "Perhaps the most frustrating issue relevant to workload recording is the difference between workloaded productivity and nonworkloaded productivity. For many years, productivity was calculated by CAP only based on the numbers of CAP units that were generated by total paid hours (paid productivity). The result was that laboratories with a greater burden of educational responsibility, quality assurance, research and development, and effective administration appeared to be less productive than those that simply ground out work. Therefore, laboratories which might not bear the test of a critical inspection might well display greater productivity than a more responsibly organized and directed laboratory. In recognition of this discrepancy, CAP acknowledged that productivity could be calculated by subtracting from the denominator the hours expended on \"nonworkloaded activity.\" It is extremely difficult and time consuming to determine this type of activity. We have conducted a study in our laboratory, using diaries to document activity of technologists during every 15 minutes of the working day (Table 1) . CAP has published data based on such studies in the workload recording Method Manual but, here again, has provided no range of values or standard deviations. They do indicate that the data were collected from \"community hospital laboratories,\" but we are not told how many laboratories were surveyed and how large the hospitals were. We were astonished to determine that the number of hours spent on nonworkloaded activity in our laboratory was almost twice what we had expected. This is a two-edged sword. Although the information increased our workloaded productivity, it raised a red flag for administration to attack. How could we justify all of this nonworkloaded activity in our laboratory? CAP should conduct much more elaborate studies of the extent of nonworkloaded activity in different types of laboratories. Even if this information is made available, most laboratorians would find it difficult or impossible to accurately determine the time that is being spent on nonworkloaded activity. Administrators in some hospitals have taken the position that the laboratory budget will be established by the following formula, which assumes that one can calculate the number of hours that should be added to or subtracted from the laboratory budget to accommodate a workload measured in CAP units at a target level of productivity:",
