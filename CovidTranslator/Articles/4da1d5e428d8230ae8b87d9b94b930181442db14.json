The iris controls the amount of light entering the eye, and the ciliary body alters the focal power of the lens, produces aqueous humor that supplies nutrition to ocular structures, and aids in regulating intraocular pressure (IOP). Together they also form a bloodaqueous barrier so as to maintain the clarity of the aqueous humor and vitreous. The choroid plays a major role in providing nutrition to the retina. Because of these diverse roles, uveal disorders are frequently associated with alterations in vision and IOP.",

PPMs may span from one region of the iris to another (sometimes crossing the pupil) or they may extend to the cornea or lens, creating opacities in these structures. PPMs can usually be differentiated from inflammatory anterior or posterior synechia on the basis of their origin near the iris collarette region (versus an origin at the pupillary margin for synechia) and their presence at birth. It usually is possible to see the membrane extending from the iris collarette region to the cornea or lens, although occasionally the membrane may have broken free and the cornea or lens opacity (often pigmented) is all that remains. Therapy is not typically required or possible. The best method of preventing the disorder is to examine breeding stock and breed only animals that are free of PPMs. Slit-lamp biomicroscopy is essential for the examinations. ",

Although each of these schemes has its own advantages and disadvantages, classification into granulomatous or nongranulomatous and then by specific etiology is probably the most useful method in a clinical setting, because it also helps guide specific therapy (Table 11 -5). This scheme, however, is plagued by the presence of a large percentage of patients having idiopathic uveitis in which the cause remains obscure and therapy can be only nonspecific and directed at controlling inflammation and preventing further damage to the eye. Presumably, most of these cases are immune-mediated or involve microorganisms that are not yet recognized as pathogenic.

These agents inhibit cell-mediated immune reactions, decrease antibody production, and stabilize lysosomal membranes, reducing release of intracellular proteolytic enzymes. If corticosteroids are administered via the topical or subconjunctival routes the cornea must not retain fluorescein stain. Additionally, immunosuppressive therapy should not be instituted if active infectious diseases, such as a deep fungal agent, have not been ruled out. In general the following approach is helpful: NONSTEROIDAL ANTIINFLAMMATORY DRUGS. Significant protein leakage from uveal vessels during inflammation is mediated by prostaglandins. Inhibition of prostaglandin production decreases the amount of antibody present to engage in immunologic reactions and also decreases fibrin, which reduces synechia formation. Because endogenous prostaglandins also contribute to miosis by a mechanism that is not blocked by atropine, an NSAID may facilitate pupillary dilation with atropine. In general topical and systemic NSAIDs are not as potent as corticosteroids in the treatment of immune-mediated uveitis but may approximate or exceed the efficacy of corticosteroids in traumatic uveitis. Topical NSAIDS include flurbiprofen, suprofen, and diclofenac. These drugs are administered every 6 to 12 hours in most species. Systemic NSAIDS are typically dosed at levels recommended for the species being treated. IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENTS. Topical 0.02% to 2.0% cyclosporine, oral cyclosporine, or oral azathioprine may be used in select cases of nonresponsive uveitis. Typically these agents require periodic laboratory evaluations for systemic side effects, especially those involving the bone marrow, liver, and kidney. Azathioprine has been suggested at 1 to 2 mg/kg/day for 3 to 7 days, followed by tapering to as low a dosage as possible.",

Relaxation of the ciliary muscle (cycloplegia) can help lessen ocular pain. In general the dose required to dilate the pupil is somewhat lower than that necessary to induce cycloplegia and provide pain relief. One percent atropine ophthalmic ointment or solution is a parasympatholytic agent with potent mydriatic and cycloplegic activity, whereas 0.5% to 1.0% tropicamide solution is a shorteracting parasympathomimetic with relatively potent mydriatic effects but milder cycloplegic effects. Sympathomimetics, such as 10% phenylephrine given every 8 to 12 hours, can boost the mydriatic effects of atropine and tropicamide, but these drugs afford no meaningful cycloplegia. On rare occasions mydriasis can compromise the drainage angle, leading to rises in IOP, or reduce tear production, especially in animals with keratoconjunctivitis sicca. In general atropine is used one to three times per day or to effect. ANTIGLAUCOMA DRUGS. IOP is typically low in uveitis because an inflamed ciliary body makes less aqueous humor and endogenous prostaglandins increase uveoscleral outflow. If IOP is normal or elevated in the presence of inflammation, the drainage angle is probably compromised and the clinician must be concerned about impending glaucoma. It is essential that irreversible glaucomatous damage not be allowed to occur while antiinflammatory therapy works to clear the drainage angle. In general a topical or systemic carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (dorzolamide or methazolamide), a topical b-blocker (timolol), or an adrenergic agent (dipivefrin) is preferred to a parasympathomimetic (pilocarpine, demecarium bromide) or a prostaglandin derivative (latanoprost, travoprost), either of which may exacerbate intraocular inflammation.",

Many of these agents are located in specific geographic regions, a feature that helps narrow the list of possible causes in a given patient.

Uveitis may occur as a result of intraocular infection or in response to bacterial toxins generated within or outside the eye, or may stem from an immunologic response to the organism, which may be within the eye or elsewhere in the body. It is well recognized that uveitis may be associated with infection outside the eye, including prostatitis, endometritis, gingivitis and tooth root abscess, mastitis, metritis, navel ill, and pneumonia. In these cases uveitis may result from shedding of bacteria into the circulation, the uveitis being secondary to previously sensitized lymphocytes in the uvea, or may be due to bacterial toxins released from the primary site. Often the uveitis is recurrent in these cases, and hematologic examination or blood culture may be of value in arriving at a definitive diagnosis. Blastomycosis, ehrlichiosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidioidomycosis are important causes of uveitis in dogs, as are cryptococcosis, toxoplasmosis, and feline infectious peritonitis in cats.

Lensinduced uveitis should be anticipated in all eyes with cataract, although it does not always occur. In this form of the disease the lens capsule becomes permeable, allowing liquefied cortex to leak into the aqueous and creating an immune-mediated uveitis and, possibly, secondary glaucoma. Without tonometry and biomicroscopy, this inflammation may not be evident, and many such eyes exhibit a dilated pupil-not a miotic pupil as would be expected in uveitis. Affected eyes, however, do typically exhibit at least some conjunctival hyperemia. Eyes with lensinduced uveitis before cataract surgery have a greater risk for many postoperative complications (glaucoma, retinal detachment) than eyes without it. Therapy with topical corticosteroids or NSAIDs, often for relatively long periods, may be needed to control lens-induced uveitis. In particularly severe cases systemic antiinflammatory agents may be required.

            "text": "There are at least two main theories as to the role of Leptospira in ERU. In the first theory, ERU after infection with Leptospira is primarily an immune-mediated disorder in which the organism is no longer present. In this scenario autoimmune inflammation tends to \"burn out\" as antiinflammatory regulatory cells get the upper hand in an active attack, leading to a clinically quiescent period. Recurrent active periods may be the result of the autoimmune response shifting from one site to another on the same autoantigen (intramolecular spreading) or to another entirely different autoantigen (intermolecular spreading). This theory is supported by the responsiveness of the disease to immunosuppressive therapy, which, if viable organism were to be present in the eye, would be expected to ultimately result in an exacerbation of the inflammation. Alternatively, it has been theorized that persistence of L. interrogans in the vitreous humor of horses with ERU can induce and maintain an autoimmune uveitis. During the periods between overt episodes, the number of leptospiral organisms may decline to such a level that overt inflammation is not clinically detectable, and antibody titers decline. When the antibody titer falls below a certain threshold, bacterial numbers may increase, resulting in a resurgence of antibodies that cross-react with host antigens, leading to greater inflammation, damage to adjacent tissues, and, perhaps, recognition of new antigenic epitopes. This theory is supported by the observation that infusion of antibiotics into the vitreal cavity in conjunction with a surgical vitrectomy may greatly reduce the frequency of recurrent episodes.",

An incidence of up to 12% has been recorded in eastern areas of the United States, and some investigators believe it is more prevalent in low-lying areas with high rainfall. There is no age or sex predilection. The Appaloosa breed appears to be at higher risk for development of recurrent uveitis, suggesting a genetic predisposition to ERU. Etiology. There is no single cause of ERU (see Table 11 -4). The most commonly held explanation is that the uveitis is an autoimmune phenomenon in which IgG antibodies and autoreactive T cells specific for retinal antigens are present. A cellmediated immunity to uveal antigens has also been demonstrated in horses with ERU. The association between ERU and previous or current infection with Leptospira has been studied in greater detail than many of the other known etiologies of ERU. This organism appears to be capable of immunologically cross-reacting with the equine cornea and lens, and in horses with ERU, leptospiral antisera is also crossreactive with the equine iris pigment epithelium and retina. In Europe leptospiral strains have been isolated from the ocular fluids of horses with chronic ERU, and it is postulated that persistent intraocular leptospiral infections by certain strains of the organism cause ERU. Many horses with ERU in the United States, however, do not appear to be infected with leptospiral organisms; also, potent immunosuppressive therapy with drugs such as intravitreal cyclosporine does not exacerbate the disease as would be expected with an active infectious process. Therefore the relative importance of the direct effects of the organism on the eye, locally produced antibodies against Leptospira interrogans, and autoantibodies against retinal autoantigens (retinal S-antigen and interphotoreceptor retinoidbinding protein) remain unclear in the pathogenesis of ERU. In any event, it is clear that ERU is a highly complex disorder with multifactorial causes related to the genetic constitution of the animal and that it is strongly immune-mediated. Common causes of ERU are Leptospira-associated uveitis and uveitis associated with migrating microfilariae of Onchocerca cervicalis.",

Although both experimental infections and natural outbreaks of leptospirosis have been associated with ERU, clinically apparent uveitis does not develop in most adult horses until 1 to 2 years after infection. Several reports have described isolation of L. interrogans from various ocular fluids, especially the vitreous, in horses with chronic ERU. The organism is difficult to culture, however, and results of polymerase chain reaction testing for leptospiral DNA are typically positive in many animals that are culturenegative, suggesting that the organism may be more prevalent than once thought. Serum antibody titers greater than 1:400 are suggestive of previous infection, although lower serologic titers may be found in many infected horses. In fact, negative serologic titers do not necessarily rule out leptospirosis as a possible cause, because the organism or its DNA is occasionally identified in the intraocular fluids of horses with negative serologic titer results. Interpretation of serologic test results may be further confounded by the occurrence of positive serologic titer results for Leptospira in horses without uveitis.

Usual duration of action is 7 to 10 days. The major concern with this drug is that it creates a strong predisposition for bacterial and fungal keratitis and that, unlike topically applied corticosteroids, it cannot be withdrawn if the disease should occur. Therefore it is typically used as an adjunct to topical corticosteroids in the acute phase in especially severe cases or when the owner has difficulty medicating the horse as often as required. Note: The sustained-release vehicle in methylprednisolone acetate may result in an unsightly plaque and irritating granuloma. 4. Systemic corticosteroids (e.g., dexamethasone 5 to 10 mg/day PO or 2.5 to 5.0 mg daily IM or oral prednisolone 0.5 mg/kg q24h): In general, because of frequent adverse effects, systemic corticosteroids are used only as a last resort in the treatment of ERU. They can be considered in unusually severe cases or when the inflammation is refractory to systemic NSAIDS and topical corticosteroids. Side effects include laminitis and gastrointestinal upset. 5. Antibiotic therapy in horses with presumed leptospiralassociated uveitis: The efficacy of this therapy remains speculative, and side effects are not uncommon. Drugs that have been suggested include streptomycin (11 mg/kg IM q12h) and a 4-week course of oral doxycycline (10-20 mg/kg q12h). In one study by Gilmour et al., however, doxycycline at 10 mg/kg q12h orally did not result in appreciable drug concentrations in the aqueous humor or vitreous of normal eyes. Some researchers believe that the efficacy of vitrectomy for this disorder is due to the use of gentamicin in the irrigation fluid as much as the procedure itself. This theory has prompted some ophthalmologists to give a single intravitreal injection of 4 mg of gentamicin in an effort to prevent or eliminate recurrent episodes in severely affected eyes. Gentamicin injections, however, should be made with extreme caution because the drug may cause retinal degeneration, cataract formation, intraocular inflammation, endophthalmitis, and irreversible vision loss. 6. Surgical vitrectomy via a pars plana approach has been advocated by some workers to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks of ERU. The rationale for its use is based on the hypothesis that persistent organisms within the vitreal cavity (and perhaps the uveal tract) are capable of perpetuating an immune-mediated uveitis. Controlled clinical trials have yet to demonstrate the efficacy of this procedure, and cataracts are a common postoperative complication. 7. Vaccination is controversial. No approved vaccine is available for horses. The cross-reactivity of leptospiral antigens with normal constituents of the equine eye suggests that vaccination may actually cause the disease in some animals. Vaccination of seronegative horses with a multivalent bovine vaccine, with appropriate informed consent, may help suppress a herd outbreak. Vaccination as an adjunctive therapy in horses with ERU, however, failed to slow the progression of the disease in one study (Rohrbach et al., 2005) . 8.

Deflated cysts appear as patches of pigment adherent to the corneal endothelium. In rare circumstances large numbers of cysts may push the iris root forward, causing secondary closed-angle glaucoma.

Metastasis or local recurrence after enucleation is common. Because it lines the inner surface of the globe, the tumor commonly extends into the orbit via the optic nerve. Metaplastic bone has also been observed in ocular sarcomas. Although some researchers have suggested removal of all traumatized or phthisical feline eyes to prevent development of this rare tumor, the value of this approach remains to be determined.",

            "text": "The diffuse iris melanoma seen in cats has specific features that differentiate it from other anterior uveal tumors. The tumor is often very slowly progressive, arising from pigmented areas on the anterior surface of the iris (see Figure 11 -22) and perhaps eventually involve the iridocorneal angle, causing secondary glaucoma (Figure 11-38) . In some cats, however, the tumor is rapidly progressive and quick to metastasize. Although the tumor is potentially malignant, the risk for metastasis in the majority of cats appears to be relatively low. Cats with this disorder should be regularly evaluated by a veterinary ophthalmologist to ascertain whether or when enucleation may be indicated. In single or multiple early iris melanomas that are progressing, tumor ablation with laser therapy may be useful. Because the disease is slowly progressive, the clinical conflict is whether to simply observe the patient or enucleate a functional eye if persistence of such an eye may present a risk to the animal's life through metastasis. Many affected cats, however, even those with metastatic disease, may live for long periods with few ill effects.",

Approximately 40% of dogs with lymphosarcoma show some ocular signs. Histologically, the iris and ciliary body are more frequently affected than the choroid. Dogs with ocular signs may have a poorer prognosis for long-term remission and response to chemotherapy. Detailed consideration of chemotherapy for lymphosarcoma is beyond the scope of this book; however, animals blinded by lymphosarcoma may recover vision once chemotherapy with one of the standard regimens is begun. Adjunctive topical therapy with corticosteroids, atropine, and antiglaucoma drugs should be considered in animals with uveitis secondary to lymphosarcoma.",
