The Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI) is the most frequently used distress measure (9) . However, the items were developed without consultation with people experiencing fertility problems, and the validation sample comprised primarily caucasian patients from a homogeneous socioeconomic category using assisted reproductive techniques (ART). Furthermore, the FPI assesses level of strain rather than the broader construct of QoL and does not separate effects due to infertility treatment from those due to childlessness, which is important given the emotional challenges of each. These issues apply to most measures listed in Supplemental Table 1 . The most frequently used QoL measure was developed for women suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOSQ) (10) . Several studies have examined its psychometric properties (11) and used it to investigate moderators of QoL (e.g., obesity) and cross-cultural effects. Results confirm its reliability and the importance of cultural background as a moderator of QoL (12, 13) . However, this and other fertility QoL measures were designed for specific subpopulations (e.g., endometriosis, male factor) and therefore cannot be used as generic measures for all people with fertility problems.",

The overall aim of the FertiQoL project was to develop an international instrument to measure quality of life in men and women experiencing fertility problems. Secondary aims were to evaluate the psychometric properties of the tool and to translate FertiQoL in multiple languages. The development phase was carried out according to the protocol used for the development of the WHO QoL measure (14) and is briefly described in the present article.

Full details of item generation for the prototype are described in the Supplemental Methods (available on line at www.fertstert.org) and briefly presented here. As shown in Table 1 , item-generation involved four stages: generating potential items; eliminating redundant, irrelevant and outlier items; validation among people with fertility problems; and cross-cultural survey of acceptability and feasibility. A comprehensive literature review and consultation with psychosocial infertility experts generated an initial pool of 302 items on consequences of fertility problems on QoL in 14 areas (e.g., marriage/ partnership, social network, emotions, cognitions, coping, treatment, physical health). The authors classified the 302 items into three levels of increasing concept specificity-dimensions (e.g., interpersonal), domains (e.g., partner relationship) and facets (e.g., intimacy)-to form groups of items tapping into related aspects of QoL. Classification and subsequent focus groups reduced this pool to 102 items, which were submitted to the acceptability and feasibility study ( Table 1 ). The prototype evaluated in the present study included these 102 core items and 27 optional treatment items identified through the feasibility and acceptability phase.",

Descriptive statistics and correlations were used to identify the best items for each a priori domain of QoL (e.g., emotional, mind/body, relational, social). This a priori work was done to ensure that conceptually similar groups of items were entered into the factor analysis. Factor analyses (orthogonal rotation) were computed (clinic, online) to ascertain relations among these items. Items with factor loadings <0.30 and eigenvalues <1 were eliminated. The FertiQoL total and subscale scores were computed and transformed to scaled scores and summary statistics (e.g., reliability coefficient, mean, SD) produced. Scaled scores were computed to achieve a range of 0 to 100, making comparisons between scales easier. For scaling, items were reverse scored where necessary and all items then summed and multiplied by 25/k, where k was the number of items in the desired subscale or total scale. Higher scores mean better QoL. For the sake of brevity, only final analyses are shown here. These analyses generated the final FertiQoL, which comprised 24 core items, plus 10 optional treatment items. The final Ferti-QoL in all languages and with scoring instructions is available online at www.fertiqol.org. Table 2 shows background characteristics, and these show that the clinical group were older and included more men, single women, same-sex couples, and people with a university education, but fewer American and UK residents and people living in rural/suburban areas compared with the online sample.

The 24 core items were conceptualized as reflecting QoL in the emotional, mind-body (i.e., cognitive and physical), relational, and social domains. The 10 optional treatment items were conceptualized as indexing treatment environment and treatment tolerability. An additional two items measuring satisfaction with QoL and physical health were retained for the FertiQoL measure to indicate general physical and QoL satisfaction, but they were not included in the factor analysis.",

FertiQol is a reliable and sensitive measurement tool for QoL in individuals with fertility problems. More than 2,000 people with fertility problems contributed to the creation of FertiQoL, and it was developed by using an integrated mixed-methods approach that included literature reviews, international expert consultations, patient focus groups, a cross-cultural feasibility and acceptability survey, and a psychometric survey evaluation. FertiQoL comprises a Core module evaluating the impact of fertility problems on emotional, mind-body, relational, and social domains, and an optional treatment module evaluating treatment environment and tolerability. Subscales and total scales show mainly high reliability and sensitivity of FertiQoL to well established moderators of QoL. FertiQoL is available in 20 languages with more translations in progress. This project was fully realized as a result of collaboration among ESHRE, ASRM, and Merck, Geneva, Switzerland (an affiliate of Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). It is expected that FertiQoL will significantly contribute to future research and clinical endeavors aimed at investigating and ultimately improving quality of life in people with fertility problems.",

First, despite the multidisciplinary contributions from experts worldwide, focus groups, and a feasibility and acceptability study in 10 countries, the final psychometric evaluation occurred in only five English-speaking countries. Second, targeted efforts to recruit a diverse group of people were not entirely successful for particular subgroups (namely, secondary infertility, men). Indeed, more psychometric research on men is required to fully establish reliability and validity. Third, the major proportion of the final sample was recruited online, and differences between the online and clinical samples were observed. Although data generated online has been shown to be as valid as data collected through traditional methods (15, 16) , one would need to determine whether the differences observed warrant more in-depth analysis, for example, a different set of norms for clinical samples. We eliminated records coming from the same IP address, but it may be possible that the same person replied more than once to the survey. Finally, the subscales of the Core FertiQoL were not entirely orthogonal with cross-loadings on the social and mind/body domains. Because these associations were expected, we have now modified the final wording of four Fer-tiQoL items to reduce these cross-loadings. Further evaluation of these changes and FertiQoL as a whole on a new sample is required for final validation. These main limitations should be addressed in future psychometric research evaluating FertiQoL. However, the strengths of our mixed-methods approach and consultation with and evaluation from infertile people ensures that FertiQoL captures the key life domains affected by fertility problems. It is hoped that FertiQoL will become a gold standard for the measurement of QoL for individuals experiencing fertility problems, whether in treatment or not.",

Ferti-QoL can be used to identify people at risk of impaired QoL so that psychosocial resources can be offered and subscale scores could identify the specific domains where intervention might be most beneficial. Recent research has shown a close correspondence between Core FertiQoL and standardized measures of anxiety and depression in a Dutch sample (17) . The availability of FertiQoL in 20 languages will facilitate essential cross-cultural research particularly in developing nations (18, 19) . However, whether cross-cultural differences exist, whether different populations have different mean scores, and whether separate cultural norms are needed are all important questions that need to be addressed in future research. A unique aspect of FertiQoL compared with other QoL measures is the optional 10-item treatment module. This module measures QoL in terms of treatment quality (interactions with staff, quality of information) and treatment tolerability (effects on mood, disruptions daily life). These subscales can be used to assess effectiveness of new treatments/medications, to monitor quality of services, and to optimize patient treatment experiences. Research has shown that quality of treatment and its tolerability are predictors of treatment satisfaction (7) and willingness to persist with treatment (20) , the latter also shown in the present study. Furthermore, a recent large multicenter study showed a strong association between a high level of patient-centered care and favorable FertiQoL scores (21) . However, the sensitivity of Treatment FertiQoL for these purposes needs to be investigated in clinical trials of new interventions.",

This process generated 302 items related to consequences of fertility problems on quality of life covering the following topics (numbers in parenthesis are numbers of items generated per topic): marriage/partnership (n \u00bc 40), social network (n \u00bc 38), emotions (n \u00bc 30), cognitions (n \u00bc 30), coping (n \u00bc 29), treatment (n \u00bc 20), self-esteem (n \u00bc 18), career and finances (n \u00bc 18), psychologic consequences (n \u00bc 17), optimism/pessimism (n \u00bc 17), reactions to alternative options to parenthood (n \u00bc 16), physical health (n \u00bc 10), importance of children (n \u00bc 13), and impact on lifestyle (n \u00bc 6). The FertiQoL technical working group classified the 302 items into three levels: dimensions (e.g., interpersonal), domains (e.g., partner relationship), and facets (e.g., intimacy) to form groups of items tapping into aspects of quality of life. Each of the three levels of classification (dimensions, domains, facets) was seen to be increasingly more specific regarding the particular aspect of quality of life being assessed.

This process eliminated redundant, irrelevant, and infrequent effects of infertility on quality of life, and the item pool was reduced to 116 items. Response scales were then matched to item content by using the WHO response scales (15): intensity (not at all-extremely); capacity (not at all-completely); frequency (never-always), and evaluation (very satisfied-very dissatisfied; or very good-very poor). The reason for using multiple response scales is because not all items could be made to conform to the same scale and because diversity minimizes response sets (e.g., acquiescence) (16) .",

Materials were translated and back-translated to English by translators at Merck-Serono, Geneva, Switzerland (an affiliate of Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). This guidance comprised a participant workbook that contained items culled from those generated by fertility experts as well as a leader topic guide. The topic guide for facilitators described: 1) aim of FertiQol; 2) its sponsors; 3) expected users; 4) objectives of focus groups; and 5) instructions to facilitators to guide participants through the FertiQoL questions and elicit feedback about these. The focus groups lasted between 1.5 and 2 hours. This information was also conveyed to participants at the start of each focus group in a separate information sheet. Because direct face-to-face personal questioning could be awkward for as personal a topic as infertility, participants were asked to indicate reactions in terms of ''what you have experienced or heard others have experienced.'' Participants were first asked to describe areas of their (or others') life positively or negatively affected by fertility problems to generate consequences independent from concepts generated by experts. People were also asked to discuss the importance of the consequences to quality of life. Only after this open period of discussion was the structured content introduced in the focus group. The structured content as organized around the themes and items generated by the experts (e.g., emotions, partnership, social network) was discussed. For example, participants were asked to describe any physical consequences of fertility problems and their effect on quality of life. Facilitators used a standard feedback form to report data from their focus groups to the FertiQoL TWG.",

Based on their feedback we: 1) eliminated items endorsed by <50% of the groups and incorporated new facets endorsed R50% groups; 2) corrected wording issues (e.g., acceptable to both gender, improved clarity, and specificity of wording); 3) eliminated and/or combined redundant items; 4) improved facet validity to make clearer distinctions within and between facets; and 5) ensured that all items pertained to quality of life and ensured response scale in line with items. The total number of items decreased from 116 to 102 (22 items eliminated and 8 added). The final structure included four dimensions (i.e., overall, personal, interpersonal, health care) and eight domains with 23 facets linked to them: affect \u00bc infertility syndrome, positive feelings, hopefulness, coping effectiveness; psychologic \u00bc body image, self-perceptions, fertility fixation; physical \u00bc health practices, somatic changes; spiritual \u00bc morals and beliefs, life meaning; partner relationship \u00bc intimacy, commitment, communication, discord, sexuality; social \u00bc expectations, belonging, support; occupation \u00bc interference; medical \u00bc accessibility and quality, burden of treatment; and psychoeducational \u00bc interactions with medical team. Together these resulted in 102 items (e.g., Do you feel sexually attractive? rated on the 5-point intensity scale of not at all-extremely). The fertility experts panel further examined the items and structure (at the Annual Meeting of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, 2003) and made minor revisions that include: fine-tuning the wording of some items (i.e., physical domain), grouping items according to response scale (e.g., capacity, intensity), reducing the number of response scales, and randomizing questions within response categories. The experts also decided that it would be best to extract treatment questions to create a separate and optional treatment module, because not all people who would complete FertiQoL would have treatment experience. These amendments were made and the first FertiQoL prototype created.",

Participants were recruited to ensure diversity for gender, age, and education (none, primary, secondary, tertiary), but all were recruited from fertility clinics by the FertiQoL coordinator in that country. Country coordinators were responsible for ensuring that ethical approval was obtained per country regulations. The Core FertiQoL module and the optional FertiQoL Treatment module were translated from English into the target language by using forward and backward process by skilled translators with a final check of the wording performed by the fertility expert coordinator from each country. Additional items at the end of the questionnaire asked participants: 1) to indicate which questions, if any, were unclear and why; 2) to indicate whether there were other important areas of their life related to infertility that were not included in the questionnaire; and 3) to provide any other additional comments.

The sample was 56.5% (n \u00bc 297) female, 45.5% (n \u00bc 239) were aged %35 years, and 60.7% were educated to at least secondary level (n \u00bc 319). Ten countries submitted acceptability reports. The results showed that FertiQoL was well accepted in all countries, with positive comments indicating that items were easy to understand, relevant, and indicative of the effect that infertility and its treatment had on quality of life. Moreover, individuals felt satisfied that such a measure was being developed and felt that the time to complete it, 15-20 minutes, was reasonable (men required longer time to complete). The problems reported concerned items that did not apply to all people, i.e., single women queried partnership items, untreated people queried items about interactions with the ''fertility medical team,'' and people with secondary infertility felt that items regarding life without children were not applicable. These issues were addressed, but few modifications to FertiQoL were necessary, with only 20 items altered. The other main comment concerned the ''instructions'' to FertiQoL and the fact that these had not provided the time frame for thinking about items. Respondents are now instructed to complete the FertiQoL regarding ''current thoughts and feelings.'' Overall, couples attending fertility clinics provided support for the FertiQoL project.",
