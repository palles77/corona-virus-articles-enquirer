            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus is an emerging pathogen with pandemic potential that continues to cause sporadic human disease 7 years after the first case in a human was detected in 2012. 1 Zoonotic transmission with consequent risk of human epidemics will probably continue into the future, given that MERS coronavirus appears to be highly endemic among dromedary camels from geographically widespread areas of the Middle East and Africa. 2 In light of this potential threat to global public health, WHO along with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations have prioritised research and development of countermeasures against MERS coronavirus, 3,4 and WHO has developed a target product profile for both preventive and reactive use of MERS coronavirus vaccines. 5 In The Lancet Infectious Diseases, Kayvon Modjarrad and colleagues 6 report results from their phase 1, open-label, dose-ranging study of GLS-5300, the first DNA vaccine candidate against MERS coronavirus to enter clinical trials. In the study, 75 adults aged 18-50 years at one site in the USA were enrolled sequentially using a doseescalation protocol to receive 0\u00b767 mg, 2 mg, or 6 mg GLS-5300 intramuscular injection at baseline, week 4, and week 12 followed immediately by co-localised intramuscular electroporation. The primary outcome of the study was safety, assessed during the vaccination period up to 48 weeks after dose 3.",

Despite preclinical demonstration of protection by GLS-5300 against radiological and histopathological pneumonia after MERS coronavirus challenge in rhesus macaques, 10 it remains difficult to interpret the relevance of the immunogenicity parameters that were assessed in humans in the phase 1 trial given our poor understanding of protective natural immune responses. Modjarrad and colleagues sought to bridge this gap in a post-hoc analysis by obtaining samples from ten individuals who had recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection during the 2015 outbreak in South Korea (convalescent serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were obtained at a mean of 19\u00b78 months [SD 0\u00b77] after the original MERS diagnosis). Anti-S1 and neutralising antibody titres following natural infection were significantly higher than vaccineinduced responses in the acute phase, but were not different to vaccine in late convalescent samples and at similar post-vaccination timepoints.",

Despite many challenges for development, the platform technologies on which vaccines such as GLS-5300 are based hold promise against novel pathogen threats because of the rapidity with which they can be formulated and manufactured; four MERS coronavirus vaccine candidates that have started phase 1 trials are based on different platform technologies. 6 Completion of the phase 1 trial of GLS-5300 represents an incremental but important step in the development of vaccines against emerging viral global threats.",

In recent years, the size and duration of these outbreaks has grown exponentially, as exemplified by over 28 000 cases with more than 11 000 deaths in the 2013-16 west African epidemic. An ongoing outbreak in the Ituri and North Kivu provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, began in July 2018 and has spilled over to Uganda, resulting in 2181 cases and 1459 deaths (as of June 17, 2019). 1,2 By contrast, previous outbreaks never reached more than a few hundred cases and were generally short-lived, likely because of their emergence in relatively isolated locations. Factors leading to the scale and duration of the 2013-16 west African epidemic included, but were not limited to, a highly mobile society, inadequate public health infrastructure, and absence of an approved vaccine. Many important advances in the understanding of Ebola virus infection and recovery were made during this outbreak, which contributed to the refinement of medical countermeasures including vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics.",
