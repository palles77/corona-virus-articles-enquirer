However, their relative ability to identify either atypical bacteria or viruses that cause LRTI from clinical samples from various sources is yet to be determined. Objectives and study design: The aim of our study was to compare the diagnostic yield of nasopharyngeal aspirates with that of pulmonary samples for the etiological diagnosis of severe acute lower respiratory tract infections by multiplex PCR. Patients were adults with community-acquired pneumonia or acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Results: We obtained concordant results for 81 (79%) of the 103 pairs of samples. In 14 of the 22 discordant results, more pathogens were evidenced in the lower respiratory tract samples. Conclusions: Pulmonary samples had a similar diagnostic sensitivity for virus detection by multiplex PCR as nasopharyngeal aspirates. In contrast, in our study, the diagnostic efficacy of pulmonary samples for Legionella pneumophila over simple aspirates was clearly superior.",

Validation of the method is not easy since multiplexing may hamper the performance of amplification as compared to single PCR [5] . However, multiplex PCR have a better diagnostic yield for viruses than standard cell cultures with a specificity equal to or above 90% [6] .",

The detection of urinary antigen of L. pneumophila serotype 1 is very useful in the diagnosis, but not sufficiently sensitive. In our study, one case of Legionellosis gave a negative result for urinary antigen testing but was positive by PCR on the LRT sample. Our comparative study of NPAs versus LRT samples highlights the clear superiority of pulmonary samples for the diagnosis of L. pneumophila infection, as five of the six L.pneumophila were detected only in pulmonary samples. This result is in accordance with other studies indicating that throat or nasopharyngeal swabs are not reliable for the molecular detection of Legionella [15] .
