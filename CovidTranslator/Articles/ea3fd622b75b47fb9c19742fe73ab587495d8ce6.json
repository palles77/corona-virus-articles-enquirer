Some of these infections are latent, whereas others are the result of the occurrence of active infection in the donor at the time of procurement. All known types of infections have been recognized in transplant recipients. Three types of infection merit special attention. First, bacteremic or fungemic infections (staphylococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Candida, Salmonella, Escherichia coli) in donors at the time of donation can selectively adhere to anastomotic sites (vascular, urinary) and may produce leaks or mycotic aneurysms. Second, some viral infections, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are associated with particular syndromes and morbidity in the immunocompromised population (see section on selected infections of importance). The greatest risk of these infections is to seronegative (immunologically naive) recipients who receive infected grafts from seropositive donors (latent viral infection). Third, late, latent infections, such as tuberculosis, may activate many years after the initial exposure. Such infections may be difficult to treat when established because of interactions between the antimicrobial agents used to treat them (e.g., rifampin, streptomycin, isoniazid for mycobacteria) and the agents used in immunosuppressive therapy.",

These limitations suggest that to achieve the benefits of transplantation, some organs are implanted carrying unidentified pathogens.

Immunocompromised patients tolerate invasive, established infection poorly with high morbidity and mortality, lending urgency to the need for an early, specific diagnosis to guide antimicrobial therapy.

Asymptomatic Strongyloides stercoralis infection may activate more than 30 years after initial exposure owing to the effects of immunosuppressive therapy ( Fig. 29-1 ). Such reactivation can result in either a diarrheal illness and parasite migration with hyperinfestation syndrome (characterized by hemorrhagic enterocolitis, hemorrhagic pneumonia, or both) or disseminated infection with accompanying (usually) gram-negative bacteremia or meningitis. Gastroenteritis secondary to Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, and a variety of enteric viruses can result in persistent infection, with more severe and prolonged diarrheal disease and an increased risk of primary or secondary bloodstream invasion and metastatic infection.",

In preemptive therapy, quantitative assays are used to monitor patients at predefined intervals to detect early disease. Positive assays result in therapy. Preemptive therapy incurs extra costs for monitoring and coordination of outpatient care, while reducing the cost of drugs and the inherent toxicities. Prophylaxis has the possible advantage of preventing not only CMV infection during the period of greatest risk but also diminishing infections secondary to HHV-6, HHV-7, and EBV. The indirect effects of CMV (i.e., graft rejection, opportunistic infection) also may be reduced by routine prophylaxis. In practice, neither universal prophylaxis nor preemptive therapy is perfect. Infrequently, breakthrough disease and ganciclovir resistance have been observed with both approaches. 34 Given the risk for invasive infection, patients at risk for primary infection (CMV D + /R \u2212 ) are generally given prophylaxis for 3 to 6 months after transplantation. We use 6 months of prophylaxis in patients receiving depleting anti-T lymphocyte antibodies. Other groups are candidates for preemptive therapy if an appropriate monitoring system is in place, and patient compliance is good.

BK nephropathy is rarely recognized in recipients of extrarenal organs. The clinical presentation of disease is usually as sterile pyuria, reflecting shedding of infected tubular and ureteric epithelial cells. These cells contain sheets of virus and are detected by urine cytology as \"decoy cells.\" In some cases, the patient presents with diminished renal allograft function or with ureteric stenosis and obstruction. In such patients, the etiologies of decreased renal function must be carefully evaluated (e.g., mechanical obstruction, drug toxicity, pyelonephritis, rejection, thrombosis, recurrent disease), and choices must be made between increasing immunosuppression to treat suspected graft rejection or reducing immunosuppression to allow the immune system to control infection. Patients with BK nephropathy treated with increased immunosuppression have a high incidence of graft loss. Reduced immunosuppression may stabilize renal allograft function but risks graft rejection. Polyoma-associated nephropathy manifested by characteristic histological features and renal dysfunction is found in about 1% to 8% of renal transplant patients.",

Two species, Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus flavum, account for most of these infections, although amphotericin-resistant isolates (Aspergillus terreus) occasionally are recognized. The pathological hallmark of invasive aspergillosis is blood vessel invasion, which accounts for the three clinical characteristics of this infection-tissue infarction, hemorrhage, and systemic dissemination with metastatic invasion. Early in the course of transplantation, central nervous system involvement with fungal infection is most often due to Aspergillus; 1 year or later after transplantation, other fungi (Zygomycetes, dematiaceous fungi) become more prominent.",

As for all infections in transplantation, invasive diagnostic techniques are often necessary in these hosts. The depressed inflammatory response of the immunocompromised transplant patient may greatly modify or delay the appearance of a pulmonary lesion on radiograph. Focal or multifocal consolidation of acute onset is likely to be caused by bacterial infection. Similar multifocal lesions with subacute to chronic progression are more likely secondary to fungi, tuberculosis, or nocardial infections. Large nodules are usually a sign of fungal or nocardial infection, particularly if they are subacute to chronic in onset. Subacute disease with diffuse abnormalities, either of the peribronchovascular type or miliary micronodules, are usually caused by viruses (especially CMV) or Pneumocystis. 20, 21 Additional clues can be found by examining pulmonary lesions for cavitation, which suggests necrotizing infection as may be caused by fungi (Aspergillus or Mucoraceae), Nocardia, Staphylococcus, and certain gram-negative bacilli, most commonly Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 37, 38 CT of the chest is useful when the chest radiograph is negative or when the radiographic findings are subtle or nonspecific. CT also is essential to the definition of the extent of the disease process, to the discernment of the possibility of simultaneous processes (superinfection), and to the selection of the optimal invasive technique to achieve pathological diagnosis.",
