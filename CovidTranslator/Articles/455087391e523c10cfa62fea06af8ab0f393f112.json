It is of particular interest that, among the SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase inhibitors reported to date, 3,4 ADK is the only example with distinct structure-activity relationship to provide an initial feature of the pharmacophore model composed of a diketoacid core with an appropriately positioned arylmethyl substituent (1, Fig. 1) .",

Dihydroxychromones, a class of naturally-occurring flavonoids with proven stability and safety, 5 share the similar structural motif to the diketoacid of an ADK: two phenolic hydroxyl groups and a carbonyl oxygen serve together as an excellent mimic for the diketoacid functionality (Fig. 1 ). In addition, compared with an ADK with substituents attached only on one side of the diketoacid, various functionalities can be introduced to both sides of the dihydroxychromone core to allow extended investigation of the pharmacophore space. Thus, we designed novel dihydroxychromone derivatives with an arylmethyl functionality shown to play a critical role in inhibitory activity of ADKs 3 as well as a catechol moiety known to be responsible for various biological activities of flavonols 6 on either side (2 and 3, These two authors contributed equally to this work. Fig. 2 ) superimposable to ADK were prepared starting from acetophenone 5 (Scheme 1). 7 Regioselective benzylation of 5 8 followed by acetylation provided the fully protected acetophenone 7 (71% yield for two steps), which underwent cyclization (48% yield) and subsequent oxidation to give the aldehyde 9 in 91% yield. The desired dihydroxychromone derivatives 2a-2c were prepared from the intermediate 9 by reductive amination followed by deprotection with BBr 3 in CH 2 Cl 2 (31-38% yield).",

The synthesized dihydroxychromones showed selective inhibition against duplex DNA-unwinding activity of SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase. Moreover, the inhibitory activity was enhanced by combination of the two spatially separated substituents, which indicates two different binding sites in the target enzyme. Taken together, an extended feature of the pharmacophore model was proposed which is constituted of a diketoacid core, a hydrophobic arylmethyl substituent, and a free catechol unit. Further structure-activity study around the proposed pharmacophore model is warranted for discovery of more potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV NTPase/helicase. ",
