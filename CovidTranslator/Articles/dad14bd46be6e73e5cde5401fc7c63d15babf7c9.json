Pasteur's early approaches to vaccine development, attenuation and inactivation, are even now the two poles of vaccine technology. Today, purification of microbial elements, genetic engineering and improved knowledge of immune protection allow direct creation of attenuated mutants, expression of vaccine proteins in live vectors, purification and even synthesis of microbial antigens, and induction of a variety of immune responses through manipulation of DNA, RNA, proteins and polysaccharides. Both noninfectious and infectious diseases are now within the realm of vaccinology. The profusion of new vaccines enables new populations to be targeted for vaccination, and requires the development of routes of administration additional to injection. With all this come new problems in the production, regulation and distribution of vaccines.",

His aphorism that 'chance favors the prepared mind' was never more aptly illustrated than by his own discovery of attenuation. Pasteur was on vacation in the summer of 1881, and returned in the autumn to studies of chicken cholera, caused by what we call today Pasteurella multocida. A culture left on the bench during the summer was inoculated into chickens but did not cause disease. Pasteur then made a fresh culture and inoculated the same chickens, whether through parsimony or purpose we do not know. In any case, the chickens were resistant to the fresh challenge, and Pasteur realized that the aged culture had rendered them immune 4 .",

All of these, as well as others, have been employed in an effort to develop HIV and malaria vaccines, often in a prime-boost configuration, so called because the immune system is primed with proteins expressed by injected DNA plasmid or vector, and then boosted with the same proteins in soluble form or expressed by another vector [25] [26] [27] . Alphavirus replicons are a special case of vectors, in which the replicon particle carries no viral genome but expresses foreign genes in a single cycle of replication 28 . The production of some viral proteins in vitro results in self-assembly of structures resembling the whole virus, so-called virus-like particles ( Fig. 1) . The particles are more immunogenic than the soluble proteins, and have led to highly effective papillomavirus vaccines 29, 30 and other vaccines still to be tested in humans, such as one against SARS virus 31 . A widely used technology in modern vaccinology, both for antigen discovery and for vaccine development is the fruit of a discovery as fully serendipitous as that of Pasteur: that bacterial DNA plasmids containing genes from viral pathogens would express the corresponding proteins after intramuscular or intradermal injection in vivo 32 . The antigens thus produced are carried to the bone marrow, where antibody and cellular immunity are elicited 33 . Unfortunately, this technology has not proven reliable in humans, although induction of cellular immunity is more frequent than that of antibodies. Nevertheless, DNA plasmids have interesting properties, such as the ability to induce responses despite the presence of passive maternal antibodies 34 , and are still much studied.",

The new live, attenuated influenza vaccine is given intranasally, induces both systemic and local responses and gives a broader protection against antigenically drifted strains 54 . Aerosol administration of measles and rubella vaccines implants the attenuated viruses at the natural sites of replication and elicits immunity equivalent to that after injection 55 . The aerosol route could lend itself to mass immunization using inhalation devices. Oral immunization has been used for some time to immunize with living organisms that replicate in the intestine, such as oral polio and typhoid Ty21a vaccines. Now attempts are being made to induce mucosal responses with nonliving antigens 56 . One approach is to develop oral vaccines from plants made transgenic for vaccine antigens 57, 58 . Demonstration of adequate immune responses in human is awaited. Immunization by rectal or vaginal application of antigens is also under investigation 59 .",

First, vaccine supply is insufficient. Even in industrialized countries, shortages of vaccines occur because there are too few manufacturers, and regulatory pressures render production ever more difficult. In the event of an emergency, such as an influenza pandemic, it is difficult to see how demand could be satisfied or access provided to developing countries. The growth of new manufacturers in developing countries like India, China, Indonesia and Brazil may fill this gap, but the solution to supply shortage is not yet clear.",

If vaccines are to be applied broadly throughout the world, several circumstances must be maintained: higher price in developed countries, recognition by governments that the financial savings because of vaccination justify expenditures to buy vaccines, and support by donor agencies of vaccine purchases for poor countries. When the vaccine target is one that concerns only developing countries, the problem becomes even more difficult. The support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for the development of vaccines against those targets has been crucial, but at a certain point industrial manufacture will be necessary. This will require vaccine production facilities outside of developed countries or subsidized facilities at major manufacturers.",

            "text": "There is a growing demand for vaccine safety, fueled in part by antivaccination groups. As disease recedes, the need for vaccination becomes less evident to the public, and more people opt out of the social contract to be vaccinated, depending instead on the herd immunity of surrounding vaccinated persons. Of course, herd immunity will fail if too many refuse to be vaccinated. But there are real safety problems associated with vaccines, such as paralysis after oral polio vaccine 83 and disseminated infections after Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin 84 . For that reason, older vaccines need to be reexamined to see whether safety can be improved, as was done through replacement of whole-cell pertussis vaccine by acellular pertussis vaccines and replacement of rabies vaccine made in brain by vaccine made in cell culture. In the near future, Jenner's vaccinia will be replaced by further attenuated vaccinia 82 and Bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin by engineered vaccines for tuberculosis 85 . Indeed, one of the advantages of the newer molecular technologies is improved safety. As risk-benefit ratios become more controversial when disease presence declines, it will be important to reduce vaccine-associated reactions to a minimum. On the other hand, zero risk is impossible to attain, and there will always be tension between the needs of public health and the regulatory impulse to guard against even remote and theoretical risks. The latter tendency acts as a brake on the rapid application of new public health measures. Thus, there is disagreement as to whether to err on the side of safety or of disease prevention.",
