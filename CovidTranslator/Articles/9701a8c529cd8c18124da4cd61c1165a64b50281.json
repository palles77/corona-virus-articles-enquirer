No strong intervention was imposed except for the announcement of human-to-human transmission and infections in healthcare workers on January 20. The hospitals started to be overcrowded with people with fever or respiratory symptoms. During the third period between January 23 and February 1, the local government first blocked all outbound transportations on January 23 and subsequently suspended public transit and banned all vehicular traffic within the city. Other social distancing measures were also implemented, including compulsory mask-wearing in public places and cancellation of social gathering. Due to severe shortage of medical resources in this period, many confirmed or suspected cases could not receive timely treatment and were self-quarantined at home. On February 2, with improvement in medical resources, the government implemented the policy of centralized quarantine and treatment of all confirmed and suspected cases, those with fever or respiratory symptoms, as well as close contacts of confirmed cases in designated hospitals or facilities. Meanwhile, temperature monitoring and stay-at-home policies were implemented to all residents in the city.

The outbreak quickly spread from the urban areas to the suburban and rural areas. The attack rate in the healthcare workers was substantially higher between January 11 and February 1, indicating a high risk of nosocomial infections. This was probably due to lower awareness of protection before January 20, and later severe shortage of medical resources including designated wards and personal protective equipment in hospitals confronting overwhelmed patients. We compared our model prediction with published modeling studies using independent datasets. Based on early international exported cases, Wu et al. 9 estimated that 75,815 (95% CrI, 37,304 to 130,330) individuals had been infected in Greater Wuhan as of January 25, 2020. For comparison, we estimated the number to be 36,798 (95% CrI, 30,898 to 43,390) by the same day, including both ascertained and unascertained cases.

There is accumulating evidence on the existence of many asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases. For example, asymptomatic cases were estimated to account for 34.6% of the virus positive cases onboard the Princess Cruise ship. 14 Several recent reports also highlighted the difficulty to detect Covid-19 cases: about two thirds of the cases exported from mainland China remained undetected worldwide, 24 and the detection capacity varied from 11% in low surveillance countries to 40% in high surveillance countries. 25, 26 Consistent with these studies, our analyses and extensive simulations also indicated an ascertainment rate of 14%-41%",

Therefore, understanding the proportion of unascertained cases and the rate of asymptomatic spread will be critical for pandemic prevention of Covid-19, including prioritization the surveillance and control measures. 23, 28 We demonstrated that the series of interventions has been highly effective in controlling the epidemic in Wuhan. Our estimate of R t =3.88 for the first period reflected the basic reproductive number R 0 as few interventions had been implemented by then. Some previous studies have reported varied R 0 (range 1.40 to 6.49 with a mean of 3.28) due to different data sources, time periods and statistical methods. 29 Even using the same dataset of the first 425 patients in Wuhan, an early study reported a R 0 of 2.20 based on the growth rate of the epidemic curve and the serial interval, 8 while a recent analysis based on a transmission network model reported a R 0 of 3.58, similar to our estimate. The transmissibility was higher than that for the SARS-CoV in 2003 (from 2.2 to 3.6), 30 and was consistent with the rapid spreading of Covid-19. Nevertheless, by taking drastic social distancing measures and policies of controlling the source of infection, with the tremendous joint efforts from the government, healthcare workers, and the people (Fig. 1) , R t was substantially reduced to 0.32 in Wuhan after February 2, which was encouraging for the global efforts fighting against the Covid-19 outbreak using traditional non-pharmaceutical measures. 31 Some limitations of this study need to be noted.

Our analyses of different periods also have important implications for other countries, where there is a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases and at the early stage of the epidemic, 1 to combat the outbreak.
