Global health encompasses both prevention via public health and treatment via medical care, all nested within a broader community-development context. This has fostered university-wide collaborations to address education, business/economics, engineering, nursing, and language training, among others. The institute is a natural facilitator for team building and has been especially helpful in organizing institutional responses to global health solicitations from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and other funding agencies. This center-without-walls philosophy nurtures noncompetitive partnerships among and within departments and schools. With extramural support from the NIH and from endowment and developmental investments from the school of medicine, the institute funds new pilot projects to nurture global educational and research exchanges related to health and development. Vanderbilt's newest programs are a CDC-supported HIV/AIDS service initiative in Africa and an overseas research training program for health science graduate students and clinical fellows. New opportunities are available for Vanderbilt students, staff, and faculty to work abroad in partnership with international health projects through a number of Tennessee institutions now networked with the institute. A center-without-walls may be a model for institutions contemplating strategic",

These include developmental funds from the vice-chancellor for health sciences and the dean of the school of medicine for the VIGH, enhanced by support for a separate complementary entity, the Vanderbilt International Office, 9 from the provost and chancellor. Two endowments are most helpful for sustained support: a student travel and research fellowship endowed by the Overall family, and the endowment from the Stahlman family for the Amos Christie Chair in Global Health. New support from the chancellor and provost has been provided for peer partnerships overseas (the first three are with the University of Cape Town, 10 the Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, 11 and the University of Melbourne 12 ) through the Vanderbilt International Office. Three student programs are described below (Emphasis Program, Medical Scholars Program, and Master of Public Health [MPH]/Master of Science in Clinical Investigation [MSCI] degree programs).

We began our work in 2006 through a subcontract from the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatrics AIDS Foundation as part of funding from CDC-GAP under PEPFAR, and we competed successfully for independent funding in 2007. Zamb\u00e9zia has more than four million inhabitants (one of the two most populous provinces) in an area the size of Tennessee. With only one city with more than 100,000 persons, the population is scattered in rural and small town areas, with an economy based on subsistence agriculture. The 20% adult prevalence of HIV has resulted in a skyrocketing death rate. Vital statistics are poor, but demographers estimate that life expectancy is now below 45 years, considerably worse than in the pre-HIV era. In addition to rural logistics, Mozambique's severe health manpower shortages place that nation near the bottom in doctor-to-patient and nurse-to-patient ratios in the world. 22 Zamb\u00e9zia Province typically has only one medical doctor per district (the population in each district ranging from 120,000 to 250,000), with the exception of the provincial capital, and the number of allied health workers in general is very limited. Because it is a very rural and impoverished area, antiretroviral therapy (ART) roll-out has been slower than in urban areas of Mozambique, with only 4% of those needing treatment currently enrolled in ART programs. As of 2007, the VIGH/ FIGH supports HIV care and treatment programs in four districts: Il\u00e9, Alto Mol\u00f2cu\u00e9, Namacurra, and Inhassunge, with plans to expand to three more by early 2008. The VIGH/ FIGH is one of two principal implementing partners for care and treatment as of 2007 (along with Columbia University, led by Dr. Wafaa El-Sadr 23 ). The program provides training and quality-related assistance in care and treatment, psychological support, community outreach, pediatric ARV treatment, laboratory development, infrastructure improvement, drug delivery and pharmacy logistics, and program implementation. FIGH staff and VIGH faculty members serve in principal roles as technical assistants, trainers, facilitators of operations (clinical, monitoring and evaluation, pharmacy, and laboratory), quality assurance/quality control, and procurement and logistics partners. In the first quarter of 2007, the clinics supported by the FIGH enrolled 1,779 HIV-positive patients for care (1,066 women), of whom 231 (128 women) received ART (A.V., unpublished data). We are experiencing very rapid growth in the numbers of persons coming in for care and treatment, now that the community has become aware of the program.",

Chinese health authorities have no effective measures for HIV incidence.

This work has documented the increased risk for cervical precancerous lesions and the high prevalence and diversity of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) types among women living with HIV/AIDS. 39, 40 We at the VIGH (led by V.V.S.) are evaluating screening protocols using cost-effective methods like visual inspection with acetic acid and same-visit treatment approaches like cryotherapy. These methods require minimal dependence on infrastructure, can be taught to nonphysician health workers, and minimize loss-to-follow-up by linking screening and treatment in the same clinic visit, thus providing viable alternatives or adjuncts to cytology (Pap smear)-based screening that has failed to make an impact in reducing cervical cancer rates in developing nations.

Through the department of medicine, the center for health service research, the epidemiology center, and the institute for public health and medicine, Vanderbilt faculty have been active for more than a decade in cancer epidemiology collaborations with the Shanghai Cancer Institute. The Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS) was initiated in 1996 and has recruited more than 75,000 Chinese women in Shanghai for long-term epidemiologic studies of cancer and other chronic diseases and to collect biologic samples to evaluate biomarkers. 47 Ongoing research includes four NIH/National Cancer Institute/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute R01-supported projects on cancer, coronary heart disease, stroke, asthma, diabetes, hypertension, bone fracture, and obesity. Current work in molecular epidemiological research on breast cancer in China investigates genes associated with estrogen metabolism, pathways of angiogenesis, extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammatory response, and prostaglandin synthesis. This two-phase study design will enhance our understanding of the etiology of breast cancer and will help identify high-risk women for primary and secondary prevention of breast cancer in other settings worldwide. A 73,000-person men's cohort, also in Shanghai, is a long-term epidemiological study of cancer and other chronic diseases, with a focus on identifying modifiable dietary factors for cancer. This study is highly cost-efficient because most of subjects have already been recruited for study through the SWHS. Follow-up rates are excellent in both cohorts. Opportunities exist to study such topics as soy foods, gene polymorphisms, and endometrial cancer risk, and a similar study is in progress of soy foods related to coronary heart disease. Led by Drs. Wei Zheng and Xiao-ou Shu, the new Vanderbilt Epidemiology Center has grown out of successes in this program. Genetic studies of these conditions are used as a model for understanding the differential distribution of genetic diseases in general. The hypertension research focuses on a population from Ghana that served as one of the major source populations for the African American genome. Using association/linkage disequilibrium analyses of several candidate genes, including the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the Vanderbilt lab is dissecting the genetic basis of this disease in collaboration with an international team of colleagues. The partnership has spawned the founding of the African Society of Human Genetics. 49 Based in Accra, Ghana, the society's membership is pancontinental, with vibrant annual meetings held in Africa.",

However, a greater proportion of what is being supported by NIH is directed to globally relevant problems. In contrast to shrinking research funds, the PEPFAR service program 69 continues to grow to historic levels. 70 It has been led in large part by academic institutions (e.g., Columbia 23 ), and Vanderbilt has competed successfully as a \"new partner.\" The VIGH is launching a new initiative in health management training for rural programs with the foreign loan office of the Chinese Ministry of Health, with the governor's office of the state of Tennessee, through its department of economic and community development, with a broad academic partnership throughout the state that includes East Tennessee State University, the University of Tennessee, and the University of Memphis. Opportunities to expand these activities arise weekly. There is also a new appreciation of global health and research based overseas in the local Nashville audience, as evinced by a special section on global health in a May 2007 issue of The Tennessean, Nashville's daily newspaper. Several U.S. academic institutions represented in this issue of Academic Medicine are more experienced in global health education and research than are we at the VIGH. Nonetheless, Vanderbilt has proved to be an institution that can leverage its preexisting academic strengths and that provides strong institutional commitments that can move quickly to build teaching, research, and service in the global health arena.

In October 2007, we launched a new Fogarty International Clinical Research Fellows program to provide an overseas mentored research year for persons in postdoctoral clinical or research fellowships, thus complementing the student-focused program. Likewise, in partnership with the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) School of Public Health, and with its Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ), Vanderbilt conducts training through the Vanderbilt-UAB AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP) supported by the FIC-NIH. We have a special Zambia supplement for in-country research training from the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Global AIDS Program (CDC-GAP) Zambia office. The CDC support enhances the core NIH AITRP program by supporting advanced, in-country training in research, working with AITRP graduates who have returned home to Zambia after their education, University of Zambia School of Medicine MMed degree candidates, and other Zambian program investigators who might benefit from continuing education in grant and manuscript preparation training. The VIGH works closely with Family Health International in HIV prevention clinical trials through the NIH-supported HIV Prevention Trials Network (HPTN). 8 The VIGH has a new partnership with Westat, Inc., for program monitoring and evaluation in our PEPFAR work in Africa.
