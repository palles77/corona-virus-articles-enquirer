The virological basis of the frequent epidemics is related to the fact that the influenza viruses can quickly mutate within their own antigenic structure. Changes can occur in haemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase, producing new virus strains against which the population has no immunity. Point mutations (antigenic drift) are responsible for annual epidemics and can occur in both influenza viruses A and B. Major changes and reassortment between human and animal influenza viruses, resulting a substitution of one or both the surface proteins (antigenic shift), only occur in influenza A viruses and can be responsible for pandemics [1] .",

Moreover, the high level of influenza virus diffusion and the short period of incubation make it difficult to develop timely strategies to control and limit the spread of the illness. Consequently, vaccination remains the best measure for the prevention and control of the illness. In order to limit the circulation of the influenza virus and protect the subjects at high risk, the objective established by the NHP for 1998-2000 in Italy was 75% of vaccination coverage in the population older than 65 years [12] . In Italy, vaccine immunoprophylaxis, conducted yearly through specific vaccination campaigns promoted by the Ministry of Health and ISS, is free administered to subjects over 65 years or at high risk of complications through the network of vaccination centers of the Departments of Prevention or through regional GPs.",

During the four-year virological surveillance, the typing of viruses conducted during the epidemic period on nasopharyngeal secretions from patients with suspect influenza syndrome evidenced the circulation of different virus strains. In particular, during the 1999-2000 influenza season, all the viruses identified (apart from one non-subtyped) belonged to the A/H3N2 subtype. During the 2000-2001 season a A/H1N1 subtype virus was identified in all the samples tested. In the following season (2001-2002), all viruses belonged to type B.
