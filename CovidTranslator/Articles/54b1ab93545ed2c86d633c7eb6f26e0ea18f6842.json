Benzamide 11e was identified as a potent NRI with good selectivity over SRI and DRI, good in vitro metabolic stability, weak CYP inhibition and low affinity for ion channels. Evaluation in vivo, in rat microdialysis experiments, showed 11e increased noradrenaline levels by up to 350% confirming good CNS penetration. Benzamide 11e was differentiated from previous NRIs as it was significantly less lipophilic. Here we report the synthesis and antitumor activity of novel 1-(4-methoxyphenethyl)-1Hbenzimidazole-5-carboxylic acid derivatives 6(a-k) and their preursors 5(a-k). A methyl 1-(4methoxyphenethyl)-2-(4-fluoro-3-nitrophenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-5-carboxylate (5a) identified as potential antileukemic agent with IC50 value 3 lM. Further we show that the compound 5a induces S/G2 cell cycle arrest leading to apoptosis. Tyrianthins A (1) and B (2), two partially acylated glycolipid ester-type heterodimers were isolated from a methanol-soluble extract of Ipomoea tyrianthina. Scammonic acid A was determined as the glycosidic acid in both monomeric units. Tyrianthin A (1) (IC 50 0.24 \u00b1 0.09 lM and E max 81.80 \u00b1 0.98%), and tyrianthin B (2) (IC 50 0.14 \u00b1 0.08 lM and E max 87.68 \u00b1 0.72%) showed significant in vitro relaxant effect on aortic rat rings, in endothelium-and concentration-dependent manners. Also, these compounds were able to increase the release of GABA and glutamic acid in brain cortex, and displayed weak antimycobacterial activity. We have designed and synthesized a novel series of pyrrolidinones as progesterone receptor partial agonists. Compounds from this series had improved AR selectivity, rat pharmacokinetic properties, and in vivo potency compared to the lead compound. In addition, these compounds had improved selectivity against hERG channel inhibition.",

In this study, we illustrate for the synthesis of a highly potent selective inhibitor for ROS1 kinase. The synthesized compound 1 was tested initially at a single dose concentration of 10 lM over 45 different kinases. At this concentration, a 94% inhibition of the enzymatic activity of ROS1 kinase was observed, while the inhibition in activity was below 30% in all of the other kinases. The pyrazole compound 1 showed an IC 50 value of 199 nM for ROS1 kinase. A series of novel 1,2,4-oxadiazole, phthalimide, amide and other derivatives of ISO-1 were synthesized and probed for inhibition of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) activity. Several compounds inhibited MIF enzymatic activity at levels better than ISO-1. Of note, compounds 7, 22, 23, 24, 25 and 27 inhibited the spontaneous secretion/release/recognition of MIF from freshly isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and, more importantly, inhibited the MIF-induced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and/or interleukin-1b (IL-1b) significantly better than ISO-1. Using the X-ray crystal structure of an amide-based progesterone receptor (PR) partial agonist bound to the PR ligand binding domain, a novel PR partial agonist class containing a pyrrolidine ring was designed. Members of this class of N-alkylpyrrolidines demonstrate potent and highly selective partial agonism of the progesterone receptor, and one of these analogs was shown to be efficacious upon oral dosing in the OVX rat model of estrogen opposition.

The discovery of 38E1 as a highly potent non-steroidal glucocorticoid agonist is described. A series of bezimidazole-isatin oximes were prepared and profiled as inhibitors of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) replication in cell culture. Structure-activity relationship studies were directed toward optimization of antiviral activity, cell permeability and metabolic stability in human liver micorosomes (HLM). Parallel combinatorial synthetic chemistry was employed to functionalize isatin oximes via O-alkylation which quickly identified a subset of small, lipophilic substituents that established good potency for the series. Further optimization of the isatin oxime derivatives focused on introduction of nitrogen atoms to the isatin phenyl ring to provide a series of azaisatin oximes with significantly improved PK properties. Several aza-isatin oximes analogs displayed targeted metabolic stability in HLM and permeability across a confluent monolayer of CaCo-2 cells. These studies identified several compounds, including 18i, 18j and 18n that demonstrated antiviral activity in the BALB/c mouse model of RSV infection following oral dosing.",
