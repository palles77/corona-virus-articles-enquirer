Methods: Nasal-pharyngeal swabs from 233 preschool aged children were prospectively collected over four consecutive time periods, during one school year. The samples were tested using a RT-PCR DNA/RNA microarray system for nine respiratory viruses. Results: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was a predictor of the presence of influenza virus (INFL) (OR: 9.12, CI: 1.52---54.75, p = 0.016), and similarly, INFL predicted the presence of RSV (OR: 4.01, CI: 1.14---14.16, p = 0.030). Also, rhinovirus (RV) was a predictor of adenovirus (ADV) presence (OR: 3.66, CI: 1.10---12.14, p = 0.034), and similarly, ADV predicted the presence of RV (OR: 4.05, CI: 1.02---16.05, p = 0.046). No other significant associations between viruses were observed. Conclusion: Our results indicate that respiratory viruses found in carrier stage in asymptomatic children may interact with other viruses and even facilitate their settling in the upper respiratory tract. The pathophysiological role of these interactions is not yet clear.",

As these tests are relatively easy and quick to perform, they are considered excellent tools for epidemiologic studies. 4, 5 The latter may play a key role in clarifying the complex and often intertwined behavior of the different organisms involved in the respiratory tract infections and their impact on child health.",

In statistical analysis, Shapiro---Wilk W test and Fisher exact test, t-test, and Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used for normality testing and univariate analysis, respectively. In order to investigate the statistical associations between viruses we used sequential longitudinal logistic regression models. Longitudinal models account for the correlation of samples from the same child and therefore provide more accurate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Each of the five most prevalent viruses (HBoV, RV, RSV, INFL, and ADV) was sequentially used as the dependent variable whereas the rest of the viruses served as independent variables.

            "text": "Our study showed that the presence and co-existence of different viruses in the nasopharynx of healthy preschool children was a quite common phenomenon. Viral carriage was high, although somewhat lower than previously reported. 10, 14, 15 In general, rates of viral carriage vary widely among studies and this is probably due to differences in both populations' characteristics and environmental conditions. In any event, the high rate of viral detection in asymptomatic children raises the question of correctly interpreting a positive result in case of URI. The most prevalent virus in our cohort was HBoV, a finding consistent with previous publications, suggesting prolonged persistence and shedding of HBoV from the nasopharyngeal secretions of asymptomatic children. 16, 17 Tobacco smoke is probably the most important cause of indoor air pollution 18 and so we measured and accounted for it in our analysis of UC levels. Urine cotinine level measurement was elected over data acquired through parental questionnaires because the latter are relatively blunt instruments compared with cotinine. Indeed, smoking is frequently misreported, especially in areas with a high prevalence of female smokers, as is often the case in Mediterranean countries. 19 Cotinine has a half-life of about 18 h in children 20 and is currently considered the most accurate approach to estimate short-term SHS exposure. 21 Since the duration of the study was rather short, major changes in parental smoking habits were not expected. So, even though measuring cotinine twice and taking the mean as the representative value in each child cannot describe the variability of SHS exposure, we believe that it provides a quite reliable estimate for the purposes of our study.",

Wiertsema et al., 15 in their study of healthy children with recurrent episodes of acute otitis media found many positive interactions among PIV, enterovirus, coronavirus, RSV, HBoV, and RV. Van den Bergh et al. 14 performed a study in a group of six to 24 month-old healthy children and found that RV was positively associated with enteroviruses, and negatively with coronaviruses. They also showed that enteroviruses were positively associated with HBoV, WU polyomavirus, PIV, and human parechovirus. However, the above two studies were cross-sectional and as such could not depict the dynamics of the described relations over time. To the best of our knowledge, the only study that investigated the probability of coexistence of microorganisms in the URT of asymptomatic children using a longitudinal approach is the one performed by Jacoby et al. 11 who reported a positive correlation between ADV and RV. Our analysis resulted in the same conclusion, and we additionally found a similar association between INFL and RSV. Although our results may imply facilitation of the carrier stage between these two pairs of viruses, they cannot support or refute whether this phenomenon may assist subsequent infections, or constitutes a part of a procedure that aims to maintain equilibrium between microorganisms existing in carrier stage in the nasopharynx.",
