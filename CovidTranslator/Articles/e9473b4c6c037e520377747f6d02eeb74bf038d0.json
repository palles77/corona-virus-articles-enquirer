Incidence rates of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPD) are similar to those in high-income countries and vaccination coverage is uniformly high. These achievements are the result of enormous effort and evolving responses to new challenges and opportunities over the past 65 years. When the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the new government faced immense health problems. Most of the 550 million population lived in rural areas and in extreme poverty with little access to health care. Infant mortality exceeded 200 per 1000 births and average life expectancy was only 35 years [2] . Lack of United Nations' recognition limited international support and scientific exchange. Despite these challenges, the government set ambitious health goals and positioned immunizations as a central to their achievement.",

In 1946, constitutional principles of the Communist Party in the Shaanxi-Ningxia-Gansu Border Region affirmed ''people's rights to freedom from ill health\", and in line with this progressive policy, free mass vaccination campaigns against smallpox and cholera were implemented in liberated areas [3] . This was the first time that large numbers of the rural poor in China benefitted from vaccination. Since then, China's public health system has undergone numerous reforms with continued strengthening of VPD control efforts through sustained high-level political commitment to immunizations, strong supportive legal frameworks, increased public finance, dedicated efforts of many scientists and public health professionals and grass-roots health workers, and national scale-up of successful innovative delivery approaches that optimized use of available material and human resources. This article describes China's work on VPD control during 1949 to 2016, which has not been widely described.",

The NNDRS is a compulsory reporting system established in 1950 for 15 diseases with high epidemic potential including cholera, plague, smallpox, Japanese encephalitis (JE), meningococcal meningitis, poliomyelitis, diphtheria, pertussis, and measles. Data on each case is limited to critical information including name, address, date of birth, date of disease onset, age, sex, and occupation. The NNDRS has since been expanded to 39 diseases, including hepatitis A and hepatitis B, tuberculosis, neonatal tetanus, mumps and rubella but the type of data collected has remained largely unchanged. Hepatitis B burden, using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) seropositivity as a marker for chronic infection, and hepatitis B vaccination coverage were estimated through national serosurveys conducted in 1992, 2006, and 2014 [4] [5] [6] . All three serosurveys relied on random sampling of persons in the Disease Surveillance Point (DSP) Surveillance System, a nationally representative sample of rural townships and urban neighborhoods representing approximately 1% of the total population.",

Manufacturing facilities were built in Wuhan (1950) and Chengdu (1953) to create a network of six regional manufacturers under MoH supervision responsible for producing vaccines for the entire country. In 1950, a plan was developed to eradicate smallpox nationwide through free mass compulsory vaccination of the entire population. By the end of 1952, MoH announced that over 200 million people (about 44% of total population) had been vaccinated and smallpox rapidly disappeared from most of the country with the last case occurring in 1960 [ Fig. 1 ]. Building on this success, the State Council issued a directive in 1953 requiring establishment of a network of Epidemic Prevention Stations (EPS) at province, prefecture and county levels, with VPD control a main responsibility. Directives on vaccination of children with diphtheria toxoid and Bacillus Calmette Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) were issued in 1953 and 1954, respectively, and research was accelerated to develop vaccines against diseases responsible for high mortality including polio, measles, and JE.",

Annual meetings were held by MoH with provincial health departments and vaccine manufacturers to prioritize limited supplies. To expedite delivery before the vaccines lost potency, a highly coordinated ''rush-relay\" transport approach was developed; when vaccines were shipped by the manufacturer, usually by train or truck, the provincial EPS was notified by telephone or telegraph when the vaccines would arrive and to mobilize of all forms of transport (motor vehicles, bicycles, pack animals, health staff) to move the vaccines as rapidly as possible to the periphery. Local cold storage solutions included use of refrigerators at food processing plants, wells, cellars, burial underground, and wooden boxes built with separate compartments for bottles of frozen water or pieces of ice. Usually vaccines were transported from one administrative level to the next within a day and campaigns were completed in a single day. Limited vaccine supplies precluded province-wide campaigns, so each province was divided into sections targeted on a rotating basis over a five to six-year period, with each campaign targeting all children under 7 years old. As a result, by school entry most children had received only one or two doses each of diphtheria, pertussis and polio vaccines. While killed vaccines and toxoids could remain potent for up to 30 days, OPV and measles were live attenuated vaccines and lost potency within one week, limiting their use to urban areas and impacts. In 1959, a measles epidemic coinciding with rural famine during the Great Leap Forward affected nearly 11 million persons and caused 262,000 deaths; during 1963-1966, epidemic poliomyelitis spread throughout the country with 130,000 cases reported [ Fig. 1 ].",

In the early 1970s, a number of important public health reforms were instituted that had greatly strengthened VPD control efforts. In 1972, the Rural Cooperative Medical System (RCMS) was established with commune-level health stations staffed by a new cadre of part-time peasants (''barefoot doctors\") who received three months of training in delivery of basic medical and preventive services, including vaccinations. These grass-roots health workers were responsible for transporting vaccines from county and commune hospitals to their villages and administering vaccinations, which were essentially free with delivery costs covered by pooled RCMS funds. Vaccine production was increased and the frequency of campaigns were increased with most provinces conducting at least two or three province-wide campaigns each year; live vaccines in the fall and winter and killed In support of the 1985 United Nations resolution on Universal Childhood Immunization (UCI), ''85-85\" coverage goals were included in China's ''7th 5-year Plan for National Social and Economic Development, 1986-1990\" setting targets of 85% percent coverage at province-level with BCG, DPT, OPV and measles by 12 months of age by 1988, and 85% coverage at county-level by 1990. While the UCI goals were lower than China's 1982 coverage targets and excluded JE and meningococcal meningitis, the target age for being fully vaccinated was much younger -12 months instead of 6 years of age. Administering the entire primary series of BCG, DPT, OPV and measles vaccines during infancy would require at least six vaccination sessions per year nationwide, ability to delivery vaccinations year-round, and huge investments to extend the cold chain to township levels nationwide. The first coverage survey in China was conducted in 11 provinces with assistance from WHO in 1983 highlighted the magnitude of the challenge [ Table 1 ].",

By the early 1980s most of the EPI vaccines were lyophilized and more thermostable, enabling delivery to more remote areas. By 1985, annual production had increased to 110 million doses each of OPV, DPT, and measles, and 80 million doses of BCG.

Public health departments were largely left to generate their own operating expenses. In some regions, innovative financing mechanisms were developed to secure additional funding for immunizations, such as the ''EPI Contract\", a lump-sum payment by parents to cover the cost of all EPI vaccinations that was pooled and divided between village, township and county-levels to cover delivery costs, as well as an indemnity payment if a child developed a VPD against which he or she had been vaccinated.

At that time, China had the largest disease burden of hepatitis B in the world with approximately 10% of the population chronically infected. Adding hepatitis B vaccine would have tripled government vaccine costs per child from 4.5 to 12.6 RMB, so market strategies were also used to finance introduction of this expensive new vaccine. The government added hepatitis B to the EPI but exceptionally allowed the vaccine cost to be passed to parents. This cost-recovery approach provided a strong incentive to health workers to deliver the vaccine and national coverage with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine in infants increased from 30% in 1992, to 84% in 2001, preventing millions of infections and averting hundreds of thousands of deaths.

Selfreliance has been a defining characteristic stimulating the development of innovative strategies to maximize use of limited resources, including mass training of village-based lay health workers to deliver vaccinations, cost-sharing strategies to finance introduction of new vaccines, large-scale social mobilization, use of rapid pulsedelivery approaches to leverage existing vaccine thermostability in areas without cold chain, support for domestic vaccine production, and rapid national scale-up of successful pilots.

Progress toward the 2020 Global Vaccine Action Plan 90% coverage target is off-track, and in 2017, nearly 20 million infants were not vaccinated [22] . Many of these children are socioeconomically marginalized, live in fragile or remote settings, and have limited access to health care. A delivery model that relies primarily on nurses and clinical officers to administer vaccinations at fixed sites and provide periodic outreach is costly, places a large burden on parents, and likely to be insufficient to achieve and sustain high vaccination coverage levels in resource-poor countries with large dispersed rural populations [23] . China has more than half a century of experience successfully using community-based health workers to periodically come to clinics to collect vaccines in cold boxes to take back to their villages for pulse administration increasing rural access, community buy-in, and sustained high coverage levels. More widespread adoption of alternative service delivery approaches may be needed to close remaining coverage gaps.",

In China, in villages where village health workers were provided with hepatitis B vaccine with storage at ambient temperatures at the beginning of hepatitis B vaccine introduction, timely birth dose coverage in infants born at home increased from 3% to 52%, with no difference in antibody response compared to newborns who were vaccinated with hepatitis B kept in the cold chain [26] .

In contrast, EPIs in most low-income countries primarily rely on administrative coverage despite recognized problems with data quality and reliability [28, 29] . The 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa has spurred new initiatives to strengthen communicable disease surveillance and more effective use of surveillance data by immunization program managers, including district and sub-district mapping of disease incidence, could strengthen program monitoring and accountability.",

When WHO recommended universal infant immunization with hepatitis B vaccine in 1992, GDP per capita in China was only US$ 365. Adding hepatitis B vaccine to the infant schedule while allowing health workers to recover the vaccine costs from parents enabled early introduction without external or government financing, and provided a delivery incentive that achieved 70% coverage nationwide, preventing millions of infections. China's experience suggests that cost-recovery can be an effective interim option for countries to finance the early introduction of expensive new vaccines, particularly if the govern-ment can negotiate lower purchase prices, set caps on allowable charges, and provide subsidies for the poor.",

Challenges include strengthening delivery of immunizations within a larger package of integrated health services, balancing policies that make vaccines affordable against those providing incentives for new vaccine research and development, financing new vaccine introductions, and vaccine hesitancy. For many years, vaccination was one of the few preventive services that village and township doctors were required to deliver and China's immunization program is facing the challenges of navigating integration of immunization with delivery of a much wider range of other services. Introduction of new expensive vaccines into the recommended schedule remains a challenge. The current infant schedule requires 11 separate injections and there is urgent need for increased funding to develop and add combined products to the schedule, such as DPT-hepatitis B, DPT-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), and DPT-hepatitis B-Hib-IPV. Finally, while public trust in immunizations remains high, China has not been immune to problems of vaccine hesitancy. Widespread internet access has facilitated rapid dissemination of often unfounded claims of harmful effects due to vaccination that have had negative effects on vaccination coverage [30] . These and other challenges will require new approaches as China's immunization program continues moving forward.",

China was one of the first countries to apply to the newly created Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations(GAVI) for new vaccine support and the 2002-2006 China-GAVI Project was launched with US$ 38 million from GAVI (at the time the maximum grant that could be awarded to a single country) and matching US$ 38 million from the central government to provide free hepatitis B vaccine to all infants in the 12 western provinces and all national poverty counties. At the same time, governments in the other 19 provinces were required to cover hepatitis B vaccine costs making the vaccine free nationwide, in line with all the other EPI antigens. The removal of price barriers in poor areas had marked effects, and from 1992-2001 to 2002-2005, infant coverage with three doses of hepatitis B vaccine in the western provinces doubled from 34% to 79%. The 2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) highlighted weaknesses in China's public health system and a number of new initiatives were launched to strengthen public health and EPI. In 2003, the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NRCMS) was launched, a subsidized risk-pooled fund primarily for rural medical care. In 2004, the central government for the first-time allocated funds for vaccine delivery and administration at village and township level. In 2004-2005, the State Council passed the Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases reaffirming",

The largest absolute reductions in VPD burden in China occurred from 1970 to 1979 when the RCMS was established with incidence per 100,000 population dropping 48% from 3.3 to 1.8 for diphtheria, 50% from 152.2 to 49.4 for pertussis, 77% from 2.5 to 0.6 for polio, 60% from 450.5 to 178.3 for measles, and 72% from 18.0 to 5.1 for JE, averting an average of 4 million VPD cases each year [Fig. 1]. Buoyed by these gains, in 1975, MoH issued the ''Ten-Year Plan to Control and Eradicate Poliomyelitis, 1975-1985\" setting a goal of zero cases by 1986.3.2. EPI era (1979-2001)In 1974, the People's Republic of China was recognized by the United Nations as the sole representative of China allowing for broader international exchange. In 1978, the State Council passed the ''Law on Acute Infectious Diseases\" required establishment of a national Expanded Programme on Immunizations (EPI) based on WHO guidelines by 1980. During 1980-1985, around one million village and township health staff receiving EPI in-service training using translated WHO materials. An infant schedule for BCG, OPV, DPT and measles vaccines was established and widely popularized through the slogan ''Four vaccines, Six diseases (\u56db\u82d7\u516d\u75c5)\". Direct technical cooperation with WHO and UNICEF was resumed in 1981 with a pilot vaccine cold chain project in five southern provinces, and later extended to 14 more provinces. In 1982, MoH set EPI coverage targets of 80%-90% for BCG and DPT and 90%-95% for OPV and measles by school-age by 1990, assigned a full-time person in the Department of Disease Control to manage the EPI, and established the National Center for Preventive Medicine (restructured as the Chinese Academy for Preventive Medicine in 1985 and Chinese Center for Disease Control in 2002) to provide provincial EPSs with technical guidance and support.",
