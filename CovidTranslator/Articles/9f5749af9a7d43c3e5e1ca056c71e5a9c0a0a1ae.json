            "text": "Rotaviruses are the most common etiologic agents of severe diarrhea in infants and young children worldwide, and responsible for 400,000 deaths worldwide in children younger than 5 years. 4 VP6 is a unique structural protein of the middle of three capsid layers of the rotavirus (see Figure 1 ). It contains 397 amino acids, and has a theoretical molecular mass of 45 kDa. VP6, which is the most conserved, immunogenic, and abundant rotavirus protein, is extremely stable, and spontaneously forms trimers that, depending on pH and ionic strength, can self-assemble to form nanostructures, such as spheres or NTs. 5 Many rotavirus strains are characterized by conserved VP6 epitopes, and thus this antigen is considered the major diagnostic marker for acute rotavirus gastroenteritis. 6 Moreover, despite the introduction of a live attenuated monovalent rotavirus vaccine in Mexico in [2006] [2007] 7 other authors have focused on the development of a subunit-based vaccine, and in this regard, VP6 has shown the optimal characteristics to be a potential candidate. 8 Indeed, VLPs are a safe and efficacious class of vaccine, with approved members available for hepatitis B (based on the Australia antigen) and cervical cancer. 9, 10 Although the present demand for VLPs is primarily as products for vaccination, other applications, including diagnostics, biomedicine, material science, and nanotechnology, are increasingly attracting general scientific interest. 11 Independently of their final purpose, VLPs are obtained when viral structural proteins are produced in heterologous expression systems in the absence of viral genetic material, and rotavirus-like particles have been frequently expressed in insect cell baculovirus expression. 12 This system has proven to be fruitful and versatile. However, insect cell culture requires expensive media, and baculovirus manipulation requires highly skilled personnel.",

Moreover, a hexahistidine SUMO fusion construct has been shown to enhance expression and facilitate purification by means of Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni +2 -NTA) chromatography. 21 Traditional gene-fusion systems require engineered cleavage sites, which are recognized by the proteases and are positioned between the fusion tag and the protein target.

VP6 was purified in the pass-through fraction with 99% homogeneity (Figure 4, lane 4) . Given that VP6 recovered from flow-through (after passage through Ni 2+ -NTA resin) is untagged, recognition of cleaved VP6 protein by immunoblot was carried out using the specific anti-VP6 antiserum produced in mice, as described in the Materials and methods section. Figure 4B shows the result of the immunoblot of SUMO-VP6 and cleaved native VP6 with specific antiserum used at a dilution of 1:2,000. Purified native VP6 protein was stored overnight at 4\u00b0C to check for possible formations of protein precipitates, but the day after, the sample was completely clear, and no precipitates were visible after high-speed centrifugation.",

The protein was first concentrated up to 250 \u00b5g/mL in the SUMO protease cleavage buffer at pH 7.5, and then was dialyzed to a different buffer at pH 4.5 and 6 (see the Materials and methods section for details) to identify different kinds of superstructures formed by VP6, according to what was reported by Lepault et al. 5 The result of this approach is shown in Figures 5 and 6 . In Figure 5A , the VLPs formed at pH 4.5 can be clearly identified using TEM. As expected, they appear as single roughly spherical particles with a size distribution of the diameter that has been calculated in the order of 60\u00b115 nm. This result is in agreement with the determination of 75 nm that was reported by Lepault et al using a higher-resolution setup by means of cryo-electron microscopy. 5 Moreover, the homogeneity seems quite high, with few particles forming small aggregates being clearly visible, which in any case seem to be characterized by single particles in close contact with more than an amorphous amount of protein material. In Figure 5B , a zoom of a single particle is shown to appreciate the morphology and the geometry of this VLP. In Figure 5C , the results obtained at pH 6 are shown. In this case, elongated structures that are a few micron in length and with a lateral dimension in the order of 40-100 nm may be indicative of the formation of NTs, as reported by Lepault et al at this pH value. 5 Finally, in Figure 5D , the TEM image of the sample at pH 7.5 and in the presence of 200 mM CaCl 2 shows a condition disfavoring the formation of ordered structures, both VLPs and NTs. As expected, no ordered, tubular, or spherical structures appeared, while, even though a higher resolution is necessary, the presence of small spots is evident and probably due to the presence of trimers of VP6.",

The creation of VLPs using the molecular biology framework clearly belongs to the first type. A prerequisite for the success of this method is the possibility of obtaining the viral protein in large amounts and with a high degree of purity. The main result of the present work was the definition, step by step, of a fast and highly reproducible protocol to obtain a large quantity of VP6. This protein is able to self-assemble at two different pH values, 6 and 4.5, forming NTs or VLPs, as previously demonstrated. 5 Comparing the particle shape obtained by means of TEM and AFM measurements, we also provide promising evidence of the flexibility and the consequent shape remodeling of VP6. The interest in developing and refining new approaches to manipulate the mechanical properties of low-cost VP6 nanoparticles is rapidly increasing, in order to improve their suitability for biomedical applications. An evident difference in the macroscopic properties, which are varied according to the 3-D organization, is reported in this work. Indeed, the potential of protein NTs to induce strong immune responses and an adjuvant effect has been demonstrated by others. 8, 34, 35 Immunogenicity of tubular structures is strongly linked to the exclusive framework organization. Epitopes displayed may be differentially more spaced out than in spherical particles 36 with a higher expression ratio, thus affecting IgG and IgA response. 37 Furthermore, tubular structures administered to mice may have longer circulation times than spherical particles. Therefore, a deeper knowledge of their physicochemical properties may be helpful to obtain the best compromise between stability and immunogenicity. We point out that a better understanding of VLP mechanics may be relevant to understanding virus biology. Indeed, mechanical features of virus capsids have evolved by natural selection for as long as relevant adaptive features involving interaction forces between cells and biomolecules have developed. 38 On the other hand, functionalization of VP6 (VLP or NT construct) would allow the enhancement and spread of many different VP6 applications. Chemical conjugation with specific drugs and with a targeting molecule to specific receptors will enable the setup of a drug-delivery assay to be tested in selected cell cultures.",
