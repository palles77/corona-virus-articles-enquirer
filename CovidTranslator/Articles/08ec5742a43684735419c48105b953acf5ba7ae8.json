[2] [3] [4] For a respirator to provide appropriate protection, fit testing and training in the correct use of the respirator are essential. 5 The health care workers who acquired SARS during the outbreak in Toronto in 2003 were not fit tested and had not received adequate training in the correct use of personal protective equipment. 6 As noted by Clayton and Vaughan, 7 a successful fit test implies that the chosen respirator has the potential to provide an adequate fit but only if the wearer performs the user fit check each time that he or she dons a respirator.",

The passing rate is calculated as the number of participants passing a fit test divided by the total number of fit test participants. Facial characteristics, including face length and width, have been identified as important factors in correctly fitting a respirator. 9 Understanding the factors that can affect the fit of respirators will be helpful when implementing a respiratory protection program. The aim of the present study was to determine whether age and sex could be factors in successful respirator fitting. Hospital isolation protocols require the use of an N95 respirator by every worker entering a negative-pressure isolation room. Fit testing is strongly recommended, and workers are liberated during work hours for fit tests.",

Males were required to be freshly shaven. A sensitization test ensured that the participants detected the test agent, Bitrex (Edinburgh, UK). Instructions were given on how to correctly don and adjust the respirator, and the manufacturer-recommended user fit checks were explained. Although this explanation adds to the length of the fit test appointment, it is critical that the user understand the importance of conducting the fit checks to ensure that the anticipated level of protection is achieved.",

Each qualitative fit test lasted approximately 10 to 20 minutes.

Reasons for not completing the testing process included medical conditions, refusal to shave, and insufficient time to complete the test. Six women under age 40 years had unsuccessful fit tests for all 6 of the respirators tested. Table 1 gives the results of successful fit tests for the various respirators by participant sex and age. The success rate for the first choice of respirator was 95.1% for men and 85.4% for women. There was a significant difference between men and women (P , .01) and among age groups in the women (P , .05). There were no significant differences among age groups for the men.

Lee et al 8 reported that some respirators demonstrated a gender difference in passing rate of . 10%. This finding is supported by our study, in which the first-choice respirator had about a 10% gender difference in pass rate. The 6 women who had an unsuccessful fit test must undergo further testing. Using facial length and width measurements, it may be possible to plot these dimensions against the NIOSH bivariate panel used to help manufacturers determine optimum respirator design, as described by Zhuang et al. 10 Many health care institutions are currently stockpiling respirators as part of a management plan for dealing with biological terrorism or a pandemic outbreak of respiratory disease. Although standardizing and limiting the type and number of respirators carried in inventory may be cost-efficient, in the event of a pandemic, manufacturers may be unable to produce sufficient quantities to meet the demand. Thus, it may be prudent to have workers fitted on more than one type of respirator.",
