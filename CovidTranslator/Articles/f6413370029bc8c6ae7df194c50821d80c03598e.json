We developed a simple method for the selective activation of memory B cells in total fresh or frozen PBMC using a combination of R848 and IL-2. In these conditions 30-40% of memory B cells generated clones producing on average 200 ng IgG in 10 days. This method was used to measure the frequency of antigen specific memory B cells as well as the fine specificity, crossreactivity and neutralizing activity of the secreted antibodies. Following influenza vaccination, specific B cells expanded dramatically, reaching up to 50% of total clonable memory B cells on day 14. Specific B cell expansions were detected also in individuals that did not show a significant serological response. Dynamic changes and persistence of B cells specific for a variety of pathogens were documented in serial PBMC samples collected over almost two decades. These results reveal novel aspects of memory B cell kinetics and provide a powerful tool to monitor immune responses following infection and vaccination.",

Of the clonally expanded B cells, some differentiate to plasma cells that secrete antibodies at high rate and persist in niches in the bone marrow, while others become memory B cells [2] [3] [4] [5] . The latter can rapidly respond to antigenic restimulation and it has been suggested that they may contribute to maintaining the plasma cell pool and therefore serum antibody levels over prolonged periods of time [6] . Human memory B cells comprise an IgM + population that is related to mouse marginal zone B cells and carries a prediversified Ig repertoire [7] , as well as switched populations of B cells expressing surface IgG or IgA. Human memory B cells can be identified according to the expression of a variety of markers, including CD27 and the ABCB1 transporter, which is characteristic of mature na\u00efve B cells [8, 9] .",

There is therefore a considerable interest in developing simple methods to analyse the composition of the human memory B cell repertoire. This approach would considerably extend the classical serological analysis by addressing function, fine specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibody response at the clonal level. Such methods would also be suitable to study the dynamics of specific memory B cells that may not be reflected by the dynamics of serum antibodies.",

This method, which has been used to measure increases of memory B cells following vaccination, requires a highly purified labelled antigen and cannot be readily applied to study the response to complex or multiple antigens. In addition, it does not provide information on functional properties of the antibodies such as for instance viral neutralization. An alternative approach that has been followed by several laboratories has been to activate all B cells polyclonally and measure the specificities of the antibodies secreted by B cells in the culture supernatant. Using alloreactive T helper clones we demonstrated that approximately 20% of circulating B cells could be clonally expanded resulting in clonal production of 200 ng IgG [17, 18] . In a subsequent study CD40L + EL4 thymoma cells and IL-4 were used to activate total B cells with high efficiency but lower clonal Ig production [19] . More recently we reported that memory B cells can be selectively triggered by TLR agonists and used the TLR9 agonist CpG and IL-2 to drive polyclonal memory B cell activation [20] . Two recent studies combined TLR and stimulation with additional stimuli such as staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC) and Pokeweed mitogen (PWM) and a cytokine cocktail. The first used total PBMC stimulated with PWM, SAC and CpG and as a readout an ELISPOT assay [21] . Frequencies of specific B cell were estimated from the ratio of cells secreting specific IgG antibodies versus IgG-secreting cells. The second study used human purified B cells stimulated by SAC, PWM, CpG, LPS, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10 in the presence of NIH/3T3 feeder in limiting dilution assays to measure frequencies of B cells specific for several antigens [14] .",

In order to develop a simple method for memory B cell repertoire analysis, we asked whether the combination of R848 and IL-2 could be used for activation and expansion of memory B cells in cultures of total PBMC. When a PBMC sample (containing 6.5% total B cells) was cultured at low density (3\u00d710 4 cells/culture) in the presence of R848 and IL-2, the total cell number increased by 10 fold by day 7 and up to 50% of the cells recovered were CD19 + B cells (Fig. 1C) . Furthermore, most of the CD19 + cells expressed reduced levels of CD20, which is characteristic of differentiated ASC. On day 7, the percentages of IgM, IgG and IgA ASC in the same culture conditions accounted for up to 20% of the total cells (Fig 1D) . High amounts of IgM, IgG and IgA were present in the day 10 culture supernatants in proportions that roughly reflected the frequency of memory B cells expressing the corresponding surface Ig isotype in PBMC (Fig. 1E ). Of note, comparable results were obtained using freshly isolated and cryopreserved PBMC (data not shown). We conclude that stimulation of total PBMC with R848 and IL-2 provides a selective, efficient and simple method for clonal expansion and differentiation of human memory B cells, which can be used with both freshly isolated and cryopreserved samples of total PBMC.",

It was therefore important to establish the frequency of memory B cells capable of generating a clone of ASC as well as its size in the above culture conditions. In the experiment reported in Figure 2A , sorted IgG + memory B cells were seeded at 1 or 500 cells/culture in 96 replicates in the presence of lightly irradiated (12 Gy) autologous PBMC as feeder cells and stimulated with R848 and IL-2. Thirty three out of 96 cultures receiving an average input of 1 B cell/well contained on day 10 IgG in amounts ranging from 20 to 1500 ng/culture. These data indicate a cloning efficiency of 37% and an average burst size of 200 ng IgG. In different experiments using sorted IgG + memory B cells, the cloning efficiency was 32 \u00b1 5.5% (range 26-40%, n=5) and the IgG burst size was 205 \u00b1 100 ng/culture (range 70-370 ng, n=5) ( Fig. 2B to C). Of note, all cultures containing 500 B cells produced on average 35 \u03bcg IgG ( Fig. 2A) , an amount which is consistent with 35% of input B cells producing 200 ng IgG. In limiting dilution experiments using total PBMC containing known amounts of IgG + memory B cells stimulated with R848 and IL-2 the cloning efficiency was 42 \u00b1 15.4% (range 29-64%, n=5; Fig. 2D to E). The cloning efficiency calculated with total PBMC or sorted IgG + memory B cells was non significantly different (p=0.22, n=5; Fig. 2B to E). To estimate the rate of Ig synthesis by single ASC, we harvested cells on day 7, washed and plated them in graded numbers in ELISPOT or conventional culture plates. By comparing the number of IgG spots formed and the amount of IgG released over 6 hours we could estimate that ASC secreted on average 26 pg/cell/day.",

PBMC from immune donors were stimulated with R848 and IL-2 in 96 well U-bottom plates. In order to detect clonal antibody production, different numbers of PBMC (ranging from 10 4 to 10 5 cells/well) were stimulated in replicates cultures. The percentage of IgG + B cells in PBMC was measured at the beginning of the experiment accordingly to the surface expression of CD19 and IgG. IgG antibodies in the 10 day culture supernatants were analyzed by ELISA on plates coated with tetanus toxoid (TT), measles virus antigens (MV), Varicella Zoster virus antigens (VZV) or control uncoated plates. Cultures producing specific antibodies could be detected for all three antigens and the frequency of specific memory B cells could be estimated by limiting dilution analysis. Notably, in some donors, cultures containing sticky IgG antibodies (that may be related to polyspecific antibodies), were detected with a frequency ranging from 0.1% to undetectable levels. These antibodies bound to control uncoated plates, as well as to all antigen-coated plates, were excluded from the analysis. In the experiment shown in Fig.  3A and B, the frequency of MV specific IgG + memory B cells was 1 in 10000 total PBMC, corresponding to 1 in 50 IgG + memory B cells, while the frequency of TT-and VZVspecific B cells was lower (1 in 80,000 and 1 in 117,000 PBMC corresponding to 1 in 400 and 1 in 585 memory B cells, respectively). Cultures containing antibodies specific for these unrelated antigens segregated independently, as determined by the Chi-square-based correlation test. Comparable figures were obtained by testing frozen and fresh PBMC samples collected at the same time or a few days apart (data not shown).",

Indeed, it would be more correct to express the frequency of specific B cells relative to clonable rather than total B cells. In order to establish memory B cells frequencies using an independent method, we isolated a large number of IgG + EBV-immortalized B cell clones as described [22] and measured among them the frequency of B cells specific for MV, influenza HA and influenza vaccine virus antigens. On the same PBMC sample we used the polyclonal activation method to determine memory B cell frequencies and cloning efficiency. The results in Table 1 indicate that the frequencies relative to clonable B cells are in good agreement with those estimated on random EBV-B cell clones. These findings indicate that it is important to take into account the cloning efficiency when estimating frequencies of specific memory B cells using methods based on activation and clonal expansion of B cells. We will subsequently refer all the calculated frequencies to the memory B cell clonable fraction.",

Toxoplasma Gondii (TG)-specific IgG memory B cells were absent in the 1989 sample, while they were present at very high frequencies (8.3% of clonable B cells) in the 2002 sample, one year after a primary TG infection and decreased to 0.8% in the 2006 sample.

In total PBMC, R848 stimulates directly memory B cells, that constitutively express TLR7 [20] , as well as myeloid cells that express TLR8 and produce cytokines that further support B cell proliferation and differentiation. Indeed, comparable results were obtained using combinations of TLR agonists selective for B and myeloid cells, for instance CpG and LPS. IL-2 is known to be a growth factor not only for T and NK cells, but also for activated B cells [6, 25] . Remarkably, in spite of the high doses of IL-2 used, we did not observe outgrowth of T or NK cells in the 10 day culture period. Additional polyclonal stimuli, such as CD40L, IL-4 and CpG, which have been used by other authors [14, [26] [27] [28] , were found to increase na\u00efve but not memory B cell activation.

Although the present study was focused on IgG + memory B cells, all isotypes, including IgG subclasses, IgM and IgA, were produced in proportion that reflected the frequency of B cells in the memory repertoire. This method is therefore suitable to investigate the IgA response following mucosal infection or vaccination [29, 30] , as well as the response of IgM-producing human MZ-like B cells [7, 31, 32] . The finding that only a fraction of memory B cells shows in vitro expansion potential has a precedent in the T cell field. Indeed it has been shown that cloning capacity and expansion potential is maximal for na\u00efve T cells, and progressively reduced in central memory T cells and effector memory T cells [33] . These results are consistent with the notion that the expansion potential of B cells is reduced as the cells enter the memory pool; this is also supported by the observation that, using an improved EBV immortalization method [22] , na\u00efve B cells are immortalized with very high efficiency (close to 100%), while memory B cells show efficiencies ranging from 10 to 40% (D.C., unpublished).",

Using this method it was possible to measure simultaneously the frequency of memory B cells relative to the clonable B cells and to define the fine specificity, cross-reactivity and neutralizing capacity of the antibodies produced, while excluding artefacts due to the presence of polyspecific antibodies [34] . Several observations were made. First, in the MV-and influenza-immune donors analyzed, the memory B cells that produced virus-neutralizing antibodies were a small fraction (4-25%) of those producing antibodies binding to viral antigens detected by ELISA. This difference is particularly striking if we consider that the neutralization assay detects by definition the entire spectrum of neutralizing specificities while the ELISA assay may underestimate the frequency of B cells making binding antibodies due to the limited representation of some viral antigens in their native or denatured conformation. It is possible that some neutralizing antibodies may have been undetected because of insufficient antibody concentration. The fact that similar proportions of neutralizing memory B cells were obtained in parallel experiments using polyclonal stimulation of PBMC and isolation of EBV-immortalized B cell clones (DC, data not shown) suggests that the polyclonal stimulation method is suitable to detect most in vitro neutralizing antibodies. It is perhaps not surprising that only a fraction of antigen-specific memory B cells makes neutralizing antibodies if one considers that the neutralizing epitopes are only a fraction of all viral epitopes. The role of memory B cells that produce non-neutralizing antibodies remains to be established. While it is possible that some of these antibodies may restrict viral replication by indirect mechanisms [35, 36] , it is also possible that they may play no role or even a detrimental role by enhancing immune pathology [37, 38] .",

A surprising finding was that several months after infection with VZV or TG, a large proportion of clonable memory B cells was still specific for VZV or TG antigens and their frequency decreased progressively over a period of several years. Intriguingly, this donor maintained a very high frequency of MV-specific memory B cells in all samples analyzed, in spite of having been infected by this virus in 1957. In the same individual memory B cells specific for influenza viruses were present at much lower frequency. In this case the clonal analysis provided relevant information as to the selection of B cells following exposure to different viruses. In a broader context, the method described provides an easy tool to monitor at the single cell level the B cell response response to vaccination or infection and to address fundamental questions as to the fine specificity such as the cross-reactivities of the B cell responses.",
