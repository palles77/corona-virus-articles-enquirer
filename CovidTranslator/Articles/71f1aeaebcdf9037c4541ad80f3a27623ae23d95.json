It is also now widely recognized that outcomes for patients cared for in specialist CF Centres are better than for those who are not. Key to the effectiveness of the specialist CF Centre is the multidisciplinary team (MDT), which should include consultants, clinical nurse specialist, microbiologist, physiotherapist, dietitian, pharmacist, clinical psychologist, social worker, clinical geneticist and allied healthcare professionals, all of whom should be experienced in CF care. Members of the MDT are also expected to keep up to date with developments in CF through continued professional development, attendance at conferences, auditing and involvement in research. Specialists CF Centres should also network with other Centres both nationally and internationally, and feed Centre data to registries in order to further the understanding of the disease. This paper provides a framework for the specialist CF Centre, including the organisation of the Centre and the individual roles of MDT members, as well as highlighting the value of CF organisations and disease registries.",

Each discipline should establish its own rigorous framework, to ensure that patients' needs related to their discipline are met. The CF Centre should have adequate resources (e.g. staffing, IT equipment) and an infrastructure (inpatient and outpatient facilities) that allow the MDT to provide a level of care that is in accordance with the European Cystic Fibrosis Society (ECFS) standards recommended in this document, ensuring a safe, cost-effective and high-quality service. It is recognized that this may not be immediately achievable throughout Europe, particularly in countries with a low gross domestic product. It is crucial that where these standards cannot be met, procedures are put in place to enable them to do so within the short-to mid-term future, and that the hospital management commits to supporting CF clinicians. Without proper resources, a Centre is at risk of providing uncoordinated and substandard care. A lack of homogeneity in CF care will impact on patient outcomes [7] .",

Specialists should practice within their professional code of conduct and competency. They have a responsibility to maintain, update and enhance their knowledge, skills, efficacy and expertise through a proactive approach to continuing professional development. Participation in uni-and multi-professional audit and research, benchmarking, external quality assessment schemes, service evaluation, development and improvement, both of the specialist service and its provision as a whole is essential.

As the health of children and adolescents continues to improve, the emphasis in paediatric care is on the prevention of disease progression. The morbidity and almost all of the mortality associated with CF have shifted to adults. Adult services should take into account the greater demands for inpatient provision and the higher prevalence of multisystem complications. Even before the transition from paediatric to adult care, it is most important that the two Centres work closely together. Regular meetings between the teams and shared protocols can smooth the transition process for the young adult and minimize the changes to their treatment. Effective communication between teams during this period is crucial to the success of the transition process.",

Key stages include the time around diagnosis [71] , the transition to adult care [19, [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] and the transition to end-of-life/transplantation care [77, 78] . The disease trajectory itself also necessitates times of increased psychosocial support, for example, at diagnosis, first P. aeruginosa infection, first inpatient admission, diagnosis of CF-related diabetes, the need for gastrostomy tube feeding, supplementary oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and assessment for lung transplantation. Psychosocial professionals should be included in the multidisciplinary care at all of these stages (Table 3) . The CF Social Worker provides expertise in helping patients and families with their emotional and practical needs and supports patients and families in coping with CF in the different developmental and disease stages. The CF Social Worker should bridge the gap between hospital life and home life and liaise with locally available support so that local services can be accessed. The CF Social Worker is actively involved in the different transition stages, including transition to adult care and transition to transplantation care ( Table 3 ). The CF Social Worker has an expertise that complements that of the CF Clinical Psychologist.",

The goal is to develop teams that include a microbiologist, dietitian, psychologist, social worker and clinical geneticist. Meanwhile the absence of these specialists should not delay the setting up of regional CF Centres.
