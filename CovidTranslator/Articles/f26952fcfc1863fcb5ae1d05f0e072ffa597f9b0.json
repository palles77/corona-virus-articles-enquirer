This clearly places dental personnel at risks as they work in close proximity to their patients employing droplet and aerosol generating procedures. Although the principle of universal precautions is widely advocated and followed throughout the dental community, additional precautionary measures -termed standard precaution may be necessary to help control the spread of this highly contagious disease. Patient assessment should include questions on recent travel to SARS infected areas and, contacts of patients, fever and symptoms of respiratory infections. Special management protocols and modified measures that regulate droplet and aerosol contamination in a dental setting have to be introduced and may include the reduction or avoidance of droplet/aerosol generation, the disinfection of the treatment field, application of rubber dam, pre-procedural antiseptic mouthrinse and the dilution and efficient removal of contaminated ambient air. The gag, cough or vomiting reflexes that lead to the generation of aerosols should also be prevented.",

They should be monitored daily for fever and respiratory symptoms. Exclusion from duty is recommended if symptoms develop during the 10 days following unprotected exposure to SARS patients (or visit to high-risk areas), and for 10 days after the resolution of symptoms. 12 These personnel should always wear protective surgical masks irrespective of whether they are treating patients or not, during the 10-day observation period.",

The air quality may be improved by controlling the airflow patterns. The ventilation systems should be designed such that fresh incoming air mixes with and dilutes the contaminated ambient air and the mixture is then removed by an exhaust system. Air stagnation or short-circuiting of air directly from the supply to the exhaust is thus prevented. An optimal pattern of airflow (eg air movement from the ceiling towards the floor area) with a minimum of three air changes per hour (ACH) is generally recommended for dental surgery settings. [39] [40] [41] Air filtration. Air filtration could be effectively performed by using high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters that achieve a particle removal efficiency (PRE) of 99.97% at 0.3 \u00b5m. Although aerosols may have a smaller diameter, testing has shown that smaller particles do not penetrate as readily as 0.3 \u00b5m particles. 42 HEPA filters may therefore be used in exhaust ducts or any fixed or portable room-air cleaners. 43 Its use in dentistry may still be controversial as: \u2022 It is difficult to efficiently direct the flow of aerosol towards the filter. \u2022 The amount of aerosol filtered is limited per unit time and dental procedures generate a large amount of aerosols in a relatively short period of time thus overloading the device. \u2022 Filters have to be leak-proof to be effective. \u2022 The air inlet and exhaust are adjacently situated in small units (eg those suggested for use in relatively small spaces as in dental clinics) thus causing 'shortcircuits' and reducing the filtration efficacy. 41 ",

The following points are highlighted for the prevention of SARS-CoV infections: \u2022 Thorough hand washing should be done frequently and after treatment, contact with patient or fomites and before or after handling protective gear. It is a critical measure in controlling the spread of infection 55 A note on personal protection equipment (PPE) \u2022 Masks have been shown to be useful against nosocomial transmissions of SARS. 54 As the most penetrating particulate size is 0.3 \u00b5m, a mask with a specification of PFE (particle filtration efficiency) 99% (or above) at 0.1 \u00b5m may be more useful although it is uncomfortable to wear for a prolonged period. \u2022 HPA recommends the use of USA standard N-95 respirator or the European standard EN149:2001 FFP2 for routine airborne isolation precautions. Use of higher levels of respiratory protection may be considered for certain aerosolgenerating procedures when treating confirmed or highly suspected SARS cases. \u2022 Masks or respirators must be changed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Furthermore, the filtering efficiency of a mask is only as good as its fit or the moisture content. Therefore masks and respirators should be fit checked and always discarded if moist/ wet. \u2022 Eye protection and face shields are also recommended when there is a potential for splattering or spraying respiratory secretions. 40 \u2022 Long cover gowns should be worn and sleeves secured under the gloves to prevent exposure of any part of the forearm.

The principles of universal precautions is widely advocated and followed throughout the dental community. However it is believed that in the wake of the SARS crisis, practitioners should pay heed to additional precautionary measures now termed standard precautions discussed in this paper in order to help control the spread of this highly contagious disease, as well as other respi-ratory diseases such as tuberculosis. It is likely that a vaccine would be available against SARS in the not too distant future, but until then prevention is the only weapon available against this disease.",
