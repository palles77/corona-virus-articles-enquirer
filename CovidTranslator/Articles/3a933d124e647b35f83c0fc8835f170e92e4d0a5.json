Vet. Microbiol., The antiviral activities of ribavirin (1-fl-D-ribofuranosyl-l,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide; virazole), either alone or in combination with recombinant human leukocyte (alpha) interferon (rHuIFN-a ), were evaluated against feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in feline kidneycell cultures. The 50% inhibitory dose (ID~o) of ribavirin for uninfected, rapidly dividing cells was ~ 17 Bg ml-1 whereas the ID~o for FIPV was 2.5 #g ml-1. The therapeutic index ( TI ) of ribavirin (i.e. the ratio of the minimum cell-toxic dose to minimum virus-inhibitory dose) was 6.8. Although a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infectivity occurred at non-toxic doses, maximum antiviral effects ( > 4 loglo reduction in FIPV ) occurred at cytotoxic doses.",

As recommended for other viruses (White and Fenner, 1986) , a rational approach toward development of antiviral agents for clinical use in cats with FIP would be to screen potential compounds first in vitro (preferably in host species cells). Those agents which show a relatively high therapeutic index (TI; ratio of minimum cell-toxic dose to minimum virus-inhibitory dose ) would then be selected for further testing, including toxicology and clinical efficacy studies.",

Due to potential toxicity, the clinical application of ribavirin in humans has been limited mostly to aerosol therapy of infants with serious respiratory syncytial virus infection or to intravenous or oral administration in adults with influenza A or acute hemorrhagic fever (e.g. Lassa, Junin, Machupo) virus infections (Reines and Gross, 1988; Bryson, 1988) . Besides its broad-spectrum activity, a prominent attribute of ribavirin is the lack of development of viral resistance (Nicholson, 1984) .",

The addition of either 10 or 100 U of rHuIFN-c~ ml-1 to test doses of ribavirin did not increase the anticellular effect produced by the ribavirin alone (P> 0.2 ). DISCUSSION Ideally, agents screened in vitro for antiviral activities against a particular virus should demonstrate significant inhibition of virus and minimum toxicity for normal host cells. Agents with a TI of at least 10, and preferably much higher, are considered for further evaluation (White and Fenner, 1986 ). In the present study, we found that ribavirin produced a dose-dependent inhibition of FIPV and had an antiviral IDso of 2.5/tg ml-1. Despite good antiviral activity, the drug was suppressive to normal, rapidly dividing feline cells at relatively low concentrations and had an anticellular ID~o of only 17 /zg ml-1. Consequently, the calculated TI of ribavirin for FIPV (6.8) was somewhat smaller than the minimal value recommended to justify further testing. The reason for the relative sensitivity of feline cells to ribavirin was not clear. Ribavirin has a modest inhibitory effect in normal cells both on cellular DNA synthesis and also on capping of messenger (m)RNA (Sidwell, 1980; White, 1984) . The drug is cytotoxic to resting cell lines in other species only at concentrations of 200-1000 ]~g m1-1 (Sidwell, 1980) . The relative toxicity of ribavirin in resting (vs. dividing) feline cells, however, was not determined in our study.",

Our rationale for testing the combination of rHuIFN-~ and ribavirin was based on two findings. Firstly, synergistic effects of human IFN combined with antiviral agents such as acyclovir or ganciclovir (DHPG) have been reported against herpesviruses (Stanwick et ah, 1981; Levin and Leary, 1981; Eppstein et al., 1985) . Secondly, rHuIFN-~ has antiviral activities against FIPV (Weiss and Toivio-Kinnucan, 1988) . Unlike the antiviral mechanism of ribavirin, IFN produces an antiviral state in uninfected cells primarily by inducing an enzyme, 2,5 A polymerase, which eventually promotes the degradation of viral mRNA by endonuclease (Jacobsen, 1986 ) . Potentially, combinations of drugs each with a different antiviral action (as in the case of ribavirin and rHuIFN-~) could enhance the sum of effects produced by each agent alone (i.e. drug synergism). Ideally, clinical efficacy would be increased and the adverse effects of the drugs reduced.",

Generally, IFN has been considered to protect cells against viruses; it can still be active, although considerably less so, when given post-infection and may indeed act differently in virus-infected cells (Munoz and Carrasco, 1987) . Significant antiviral activities of rHuIFNa and synergistic interactions with acyclovir have been observed against feline herpesvirus when rHuIFN-a was given post-infection (Weiss, 1989 ) . Also, additive effects of acyclovir and rHuIFN-fl given post-infection against human cytomegalovirus have been reported (Spector et al., 1982) . The reasons for the antiviral and synergistic or additive activities of IFN post-infection were not clear. Possibly, the IFN produced an antiviral state in uninfected cell populations (particularly in cultures infected at low m.o.i. ); or, as described in murine retroviruses, it may have affected post-translational events, such as virus assembly or release (Billiau et al., 1973; Friedman and Chang, 1977) . Potentially, the combined antiviral effects of ribavirin and rHuIFN-a could be further enhanced in vivo by certain immunomodulatory actions of IFN believed to be important in virus killing, such as activation of macrophages and increased cytotoxicity of natural killer cells and cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (White, 1984) .",
