The study was to investigate the effects of HCP on intestinal barrier and microbiota in H1N1 virus infected mice. Mice were infected with H1N1 virus and orally administrated HCP at a dosage of 40 mg\uf0d7kg -1 \uf0d7d -1 . H1N1 infection caused pulmonary and intestinal injury and gut microbiota imbalance. HCP significantly suppressed the expression of hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 and decreased mucosubstances in goblet cells, but restored the level of zonula occludens-1 in intestine. HCP also reversed the composition change of intestinal microbiota caused by H1N1 infection, with significantly reduced relative abundances of Vibrio and Bacillus, the pathogenic bacterial genera. Furthermore, HCP rebalanced the gut microbiota and restored the intestinal homeostasis to some degree. The inhibition of inflammation was associated with the reduced level of Toll-like receptors and interleukin-1\u03b2 in intestine, as well as the increased production of interleukin-10. Oral administration of HCP alleviated lung injury and intestinal dysfunction caused by H1N1 infection. HCP may gain systemic treatment by local acting on intestine and microbiota. This study proved the high-value application of HCP.",

The barrier is mainly composed of the mechanical barrier, the chemical barrier, the immune barrier and the biological barrier. The mechanical barrier includes the intact intestinal epithelial cells and the intercellular tight junctions including occludin and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), which can be disrupted by hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) activation [4] [5] . The chemical barrier mainly consists of mucus secreted from the goblet cells [5] [6] . The induction of goblet cells and mucin secretion occur frequently during acute phase of intestinal injury [6] . The immune barrier consists of factors such as immunoglobulin A (IgA), intra-mucosal lymphocytes, and mesenteric lymph nodes [4] . The immune barrier, associates with the mechanical barrier and the chemical barrier, forms an important line of defense against viruses or invasive bacteria. IgA deficiency is related to a mild intestinal microbiota dysbiosis and a disturbed bacterial dependency network [7] . Normal gut microbiota, which participate in digestion, absorption and metabolism of the host, constitute the biological barrier preventing the invasion of harmful sub-stances [5] . Diversity and health of the intestinal microbiota is helpful for protecting against influenza infection [8] . The host will be affected adversely if the intestinal barrier is impaired.",

ZO-1, goblet cells and mucus as well as IgA are essential for the intestinal barrier integrity, which can be impaired by the changes of these factors. As the result, harmful substances like LPS or bacteria which normally located in digestive tract might invade into tissues and give rise to inflammation [30] [31] . Combined with the present results and previous studies [12] , the destruction of intestinal barriers after H1N1 infection was characterized by the changes of HIF-1\u03b1, ZO-1, mucosubstances and IgA in intestine.

HCP treatment reversed the composition change and markedly diminished the relative abundances of both Vibrio and Bacillus which belong to pathogenic bacterial genera. The regulation of HCP on these phyla and genera may be beneficial to treat influenza. The PCoA, NMDS and heatmap signified that HCP may rebalance intestinal microbiota. A prebiotic causes specific changes in the consumption and/or activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota, which confers benefit(s) upon host health [37] . It reminds us that HCP can be served as a prebiotic and used for diseases related with intestinal dysbacteriosis. Changes of functional genes of intestinal microbiome caused by H1N1 infection might disturb the metabolism of nutrients and damage the stability of intestinal environment. The respiratory pathogen challenge probably raises possibility of diseases by disturbing the corresponding functional genes of the microbiome. HCP regulated the genes and restored, to some degree, the intestinal homeostasis. Further studies are needed to verify whether the function of host can be effectively influenced by the changes of intestinal flora functional genes.",

Toll like receptors (TLRs) can bind to a variety of microbial products and recognize endogenous ligands to mediate the cytokines secretion and the immune responses [39] . After the disorder of microbiota, the undesirable changes in bacterial products may stimulate the TLRs signaling pathway. From our experiments, the expressions of TLR2 and TLR4 in intestine of H1N1 infected mice were significantly increased. In addition, the increase of IL-1\u03b2 (a pro-inflammatory cytokine) concentration and the decrease of IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) concentration were showed. The present results indicated that HCP markedly alleviated the inflammation probably via inhibiting TLRs signaling pathway and IL-1\u03b2 production and promoting IL-10 production, as was consistent with the findings in vitro [17] .",

It is reasonable to treat diseases by oral administration of macromolecular substances which were unable to be used intravenously.

Moreover, it restored the microbiota homeostasis, helping to maintain intestinal function and modify the activation of TLRs signals. Thereby, the cytokines secretion was regulated and the adverse influences on intestine or distal organs were mitigated. Besides, intestine and microbiota might be potential targets for treating diseases of remote organs.",

But form our results, although ribavirin effectively reduced lung injury, it may not be necessarily beneficial to intestinal microbiota as it did not rebalance the microbiota or even further reduced some genera to an undetectable level. It did not elevate the concentration of IL-10 in intestine. HCP had a similar effect as ribavirin in suppressing the lung inflammation caused by influenza. What's more, HCP restored gut microbiota homeostasis and elevated the level of IL-10 significantly, suggesting that HCP may be superior to ribavirin in maintaining intestinal health. Therefore, we considered that the combination of HCP and ribavirin may better ameliorate the clinical symptoms of influenza, and it is more beneficial to the recovery after the treatment. This provided a new idea for the clinical treatment of influenza and deserves further exploration.",

The result exhibited leakage of red blood cells, infiltration of monocytes and lymphocytes, and thickened alveolar walls after the infection. HCP and Rib treatment minimized those pathological changes. (B) The expression of HMGB1. The expression of HMGB1 in lung of normal mice concentrated in the nucleus, but it distributed both inside and outside nucleus in model group. HCP oral administration reduced the release of HMGB1 from nucleus. (C) The expression of TLR4. Compared with model group, HCP decreased the expression of TLR4 protein.

The H1N1 infected mice showed intestinal villi swelling, which was ameliorated by HCP. The levels of HIF-1\u03b1 (B) and ZO-1 (C) were determined using immunohistochemistry. Mucosubstances in goblet cells (D) were detected using Alcian Blue/Periodic acid-Schiff (AB-PAS) staining. Light microscopy 400\u00d7, scale bars 50 \u03bcm.
