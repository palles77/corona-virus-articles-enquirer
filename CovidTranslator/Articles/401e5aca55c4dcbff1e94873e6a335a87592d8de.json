An additional target enrichment step is generally needed for high-sensitivity pathogen identification in low-titre infections, yet available methods using PCR or capture probes can be limited by high cost, narrow scope of detection, lengthy protocols and/or cross-contamination. Here, we developed metagenomic sequencing with spiked primer enrichment (MSSPE), a method for enriching targeted RNA viral sequences while simultaneously retaining metagenomic sensitivity for other pathogens. We evaluated MSSPE for 14 different viruses, yielding a median tenfold enrichment and mean 47% (\u00b116%) increase in the breadth of genome coverage over mNGS alone. Virus detection using MSSPE arboviral or haemorrhagic fever viral panels was comparable in sensitivity to specific PCR, demonstrating 95% accuracy for the detection of Zika, Ebola, dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses in plasma samples from infected patients. Notably, sequences from re-emerging and/or co-infecting viruses that have not been specifically targeted a priori, including Powassan and Usutu, were successfully enriched using MSSPE. MSSPE is simple, low cost, fast and deployable on either benchtop or portable nanopore sequencers, making this method directly applicable for diagnostic laboratory and field use.",

The initial identification and containment of these outbreaks were hindered by their occurrence in resource-poor settings 3 and the unavailability of diagnostic assays that could detect a novel, unanticipated viral strain. This lack of preparedness underscores the critical need for the deployment of effective tools able to rapidly diagnose emerging viral infections in febrile patients and to sequence genomes that can inform public health interventions to curb transmission.",

However, these assays are limited by the requirement for a priori knowledge of the viruses to be targeted and the limited number of targets that can be typically multiplexed in a single test. The primers used in virus-specific PCR assays also invariably suffer from sequence-signature erosion over time due to genomic divergence, which occurs rapidly in RNA viruses encoded by an error-prone polymerase 5 .",

This method has been successfully applied for the clinical diagnosis of infectious diseases 8, 9 , outbreak surveillance 10,11 and pathogen discovery 12 . As it does not require a priori targeting of pathogens that may suddenly emerge in a new geographic region, such as EBOV in West Africa 13 , mNGS is a potentially useful diagnostic tool for addressing unknown viral outbreaks. However, issues related to cost, sequencing depth and background contamination 14, 15 can limit the accuracy of mNGSbased diagnostics relative to specific PCR testing. In particular, although unenriched mNGS using a nanopore sequencer is useful for sequencing known-positive viruses from clinical samples at moderate-high titres 16, 17 , it is challenging to use it for the metagenomic analysis of clinical samples from patients with low-titre or undiagnosed viral infections.",

In general, target enrichment of NGS libraries is required to obtain sufficient viral genome coverage for phylogenetic and molecular clock analyses 6 . The enrichment of libraries using multiplex PCR of tiled amplicons (tiling multiplex PCR) and/or capture probe enrichment has been successfully used for the genomic surveillance of EBOV 18, 19 , ZIKV [20] [21] [22] and yellow fever virus (YFV) outbreaks 23 . Tiling multiplex PCR usually targets only a single circulating viral strain at a time; this requires that infection from that strain be established a priori (generally by previous virus-specific PCR testing) and it is thus less practical for viruses that exhibit high sequence divergence and/or recombination (for example HIV) 24 , are present as co-infections 25 or comprise multiple genotypes (for example, hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue (DENV)). Large panels containing millions of probes have been developed to capture viral diversity and potentially enrich for hundreds of different viruses [26] [27] [28] , but the relatively high cost, complex protocols and prolonged turnaround times (6-24 h for the hybridization step alone) needed for efficient capture probe hybridization hinder the broad application of this approach. For both methods, crosscontamination is a serious concern when pooling enriched samples together during multiplexing, as high-titre samples commonly contaminate low-titre or negative samples on the same sequencing run, with ~0.05% cross-contamination reported 28 .",

We previously combined MSSPE with capture probe enrichment to recover whole-genome sequences of ZIKV from infected patients in Central America and Mexico 29 , revealing the introduction of the virus from Brazil via Honduras and the largely undetected spread throughout the region in 2014. In the current study, we expand the applications of MSSPE for use in the simultaneous detection and genome recovery of a wide range of emerging viruses associated with blood-borne infections, including vector-borne (arbovirus; ArboV)related febrile illness and haemorrhagic fever.

There was no or minimal loss of detection sensitivity for off-target HCV. Increasing the molar ratio of spiked to RH primers to 100:1 from 10:1 did not result in increased enrichment of WNV reads using an ArboV spiked primer panel at 1 \u03bcM concentration (Supplementary Table 3 ).

In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from a patient with tick-borne POWV meningoencephalitis, the use of ArboV spiked primers enriched for POWV reads by 15\u00d7 and improved viral genome coverage by 43% (Table 2 and Fig. 3d ).

All ten samples (100%) were identified as the correct viral subtype using MSSPE and genome assembly of mapped reads (average depth >30\u00d7, ranging from 36\u00d7 to 6,000\u00d7), suggesting that MSSPE does not bias the consensus genome assembly.

Such methods include differential lysis 37 , the removal of abundant human ribosomal and mitochondrial RNA sequences using antibody hybridization or depletion of abundant sequences by hybridization (DASH) 38 and nuclease treatment before extraction 39, 40 . Aside from a post-extraction DNase step, we did not incorporate host depletion as part of MSSPE, given that these methods can be cumbersome, with additional Abbott m2000 RT-PCR assays were used to estimate the titres of HIV and HCV; viral titres for other viruses were estimated using in-house qRT-PCR assays with standard curve analysis. b HIV SP/HCV SP, target virus-specific SP at 4 \u00b5M concentration and ArboV SP and HFV SP primer panels at 10 and 20 \u00b5M concentrations, respectively, were mixed with RH at a 10:1 ratio. c The number of reads was normalized by equal number of preprocessed reads for comparison. d Absolute percentage increase from using random primer only (coverage by SP (%) \u2212 coverage by RH (%)); coverage of 40-60% is sufficient for genotypic and phylogenetic inference from partial genome assemblies 27 steps, and difficult to standardize. Furthermore, host depletion methods can bias detection towards specific pathogen types, such as the enrichment of bacteria and fungi with cell walls with differential lysis 37 , or encapsidated viruses with pre-extraction nuclease treatment 39, 40 . Host depletion can also be performed at the RNA level by the use of non-human primers to bias against abundant human host ribosomal and/or mitochondrial RNA 41, 42 . These methods have been primarily applied to samples such as cellular lysates and throat swabs, which contain significant amounts of human ribosomal RNA. For cell-free fluids such as the clinical plasma, CSF and serum samples analysed here, the lower proportions of human ribosomal RNA can make these methods less effective. The impact of non-human primers on the proportion of contaminant sequences or metagenomic detection sensitivity for non-viral pathogens is also unknown. To enrich viruses from unknown clinical samples, we developed spiked primer panels to detect viruses associated with ArboV infection or haemorrhagic fever. The use of customized spiked primer panels allows RNA viral pathogens associated with a geographic region to be targeted (for example, HFV for testing in the DRC and ArboV for testing in Brazil). In the future, regional public health surveillance data can be leveraged in the composition of real-time updated spiked primer panels targeting actively circulating pathogens. This is especially important to facilitate the rapid development of diagnostic tests for a viral pathogen that is newly introduced to a geographic region (for example, EBOV in West Africa, ZIKV in Brazil). Of note, we have shown here that detection and enrichment of unexpected re-emerging and/or co-infecting viruses, such as USUV and POWV, is possible with MSSPE, even if these viruses had not been specifically targeted a priori. Enrichment was due to conserved flaviviral primers in the ArboV panel exhibiting incidental sequence homology to these off-target viruses.",

Given the success with all RNA viruses tested to date, it is likely that the MSSPE method will work in a similar way for additional RNA viruses. Second, we did not formally test MSSPE for double-stranded RNA viruses, DNA viruses or non-viral pathogens. Third, the degree of enrichment by MSSPE varied among the different viruses (range: 4-55\u00d7), in a similar range to that observed in previous large-panel capture probe enrichment studies [26] [27] [28] . The varying enrichment across different sample concentrations is probably due to several factors, including the number of spiked primers, viral titres in the sample and the diversity of viral targets. Fourth, the variable level of enrichment and coverage at a given nucleotide position achieved using MSSPE might preclude it from high-fidelity viral quasispecies analysis or whole-genome assembly at high coverage depth, especially on the nanopore sequencer given current sequencing error rates of ~5-10% (ref. 46 ). For these applications, MSSPE may be synergistic with complementary tiled multiplex PCR or capture probe enrichment approaches, as demonstrated here and previously 29 .",

Specifically, we designed an automated computational algorithm that took an arbitrary set of reference genomes as an input and constructed a minimal panel of short, 13-nucleotide spiked primers to cover these genomes (Fig. 1a) , which were to be added during the cDNA synthesis (reverse transcription) step of mNGS library preparation (Fig. 1b) .",

An in-house bioinformatics pipeline named MSSPE-design (v.1.0) was developed on an Ubuntu Linux computational server for the automated design of spiked primers. Briefly, the multiple sequence alignment-aligned genomes were partitioned into overlapping 500-nucleotide segments with 250-nucleotide overlap using PYFASTA (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyfasta/). Forward or reverse 13-nucleotide primers were selected from 50-nucleotide regions at the ends of each segment by iteratively ranking candidate 13mer (kmer) sequences in reverse order by frequency, selecting the top kmer shared by the most segments and not containing any ambiguous nucleotides and then removing segments sharing that 13mer before repeating the process on the remaining segments. To decrease overall spiked primer costs, the iterations were repeated until the number of remaining segments containing a shared kmer was below a predesignated threshold (ranging from n = 1 for viruses with only a limited number of genomes/genome segments, such as CCHFV, to n = 10 for viruses comprising thousands of genomes and multiple genotypes, such as DENV). Spiked primers were filtered by the removal of primers with melting temperatures greater than 2 s.d. from the mean or that were predicted to selfdimerize or cross-dimerize with a \u0394G value (standard free energy of DNA duplex formation) equal to or more negative than \u22129 kcal mol \u22121 .",

For nanopore sequencing, up to five individually barcoded cDNA Nextera libraries were pooled together (equal DNA amount to make 200 ng -1 ug of input DNA), then end-repaired and ligated with adapter and motor proteins using the 1D Ligation Sequencing Kit (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Metagenomic libraries for nanopore sequencing were run on R9.4 or R9.5 flow cells, using either a MinION MK1B or GridION X5 instrument (Oxford Nanopore Technologies). Nanopore raw FAST5 files were collected and basecalled using Albacore (MinION) or Guppy (GridION) in real-time mode without polishing. Illumina data was collected on an Illumina HiSeq or MiSeq instrument. Details were included in the Method section of the paper. Data analysis SURPI+ software has been deposited on Github and is available for download (https://github.com/chiulab/SURPI-plus-dist). SURPIrt software and MSSPE design software are also deposited on Github for research use only. MSSPE primer sequences tested in this study are provided in Supplementary Table 18. For manuscripts utilizing custom algorithms or software that are central to the research but not yet described in published literature, software must be made available to editors/reviewers.

Consent was obtained at the homes of patients or in hospital isolation wards by a team that included staff members of the Ministry of Health. Plasma samples from patients with HIV-1 and/or USUV infection were provided by the Abbott Global HIV-1 Surveillance Program. Briefly, informed consent was obtained for the collection of HIV-1 infected blood donations from blood banks in Cameroon and analysis for viral load determination and sequencing under protocols approved by local ethics committees 47 . Clinical samples were analysed at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) under protocols approved by the UCSF Institutional Review Board (protocol no. 11-05519). Sample collection. Viral cultures of ZIKV (Uganda strain), DENV (type 1) and MS2 bacteriophage were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Ebola cultures (Kikwit strain) in TRIzol LS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were provided by J. Patterson at Texas Biomedical Research Institute. Donor plasma matrix consisting of pooled plasma from multiple de-identified blood donors that tested negative for infection by blood-borne pathogens, including HIV, HBV, HCV and Treponema pallidum, was obtained from Golden West Biologicals, Inc. Clinical ZIKV serum samples were provided by the Central Laboratory of Epidemiology (CLE), IMSS in Mexico City, Mexico and Blood Systems Research Institute. Forward and reverse primers (ZIKV 1086 and ZIKV 1162c, respectively) and carboxyfluorescein (FAM)-labelled probes (ZIKV 1107-FAM) were used as previously described 48 . Clinical CHIKV and DENV samples from febrile returning travellers were provided by the California Department of Public Health. Clinical Ebola samples collected from patients in the 2014 Boende outbreak were provided by INRB in Kinshasa, DRC. Real-time qRT-PCR testing was used for the determination of viral titres for ZIKV (refs. 25,48 ), DENV and EBOV by standard curve analysis (Supplementary Table 19). Clinical HIV and hepatitis C plasma samples were obtained from the UCSF Clinical Microbiology Laboratory (San Francisco, USA). Clinical samples from HIV-infected patients in Cameroon were provided by the Universities of Yaounde, Bamenda and Montanges in Cameroon and Abbott Laboratories, Inc. Clinical yellow fever samples collected from patients in the 2015-2016 yellow fever outbreak in Angola were provided by the Angolan National Institute of Public Health. The CSF sample from a patient with POWV meningoencephalitis was provided by Boston Children's Hospital. Post-mortem brain biopsy tissue from a patient who died of JCV encephalitis was provided by Massachussetts General Hospital. The positive control of seven organisms was obtained from the UCSF Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. A representative mixture of seven organisms included an RNA virus (HIV), a DNA virus (cytomegalovirus), a Gram-positive bacterium (Streptococcus agalactiae), a Gramnegative bacterium (Klebsiella pneumoniae), a yeast (Cryptococcus neoformans), a mould (Aspergillus niger) and a parasite (Toxoplasma gondii).",

For these clinical samples, there was a mean 50% (\u00b116% s.d.) increase in genome coverage using MSSPE. We also used MSSPE to enrich for Jamestown Canyon virus (JCV) in post-mortem brain tissue samples from a patient who developed a fatal viral encephalitis following a mosquito bite. Virus-specific enrichment for JCV increased the number of viral reads by ~40\u00d7 versus no enrichment using ZIKV primers(Supplementary Table 13).
