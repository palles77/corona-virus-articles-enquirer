We comprehensively reviewed the epidemiology of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia in 2010-11 to inform the planning of integrated control programmes for both illnesses. We estimated that, in 2010, there were 1\u00b7731 billion episodes of diarrhoea (36 million of which progressed to severe episodes) and 120 million episodes of pneumonia (14 million of which progressed to severe episodes) in children younger than 5 years. We estimated that, in 2011, 700 000 episodes of diarrhoea and 1\u00b73 million of pneumonia led to death. A high proportion of deaths occurs in the fi rst 2 years of life in both diseases-72% for diarrhoea and 81% for pneumonia. The epidemiology of childhood diarrhoea and that of pneumonia overlap, which might be partly because of shared risk factors, such as undernutrition, suboptimum breastfeeding, and zinc defi ciency. Rotavirus is the most common cause of vaccine-preventable severe diarrhoea (associated with 28% of cases), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (18\u00b73%) of vaccine-preventable severe pneumonia. Morbidity and mortality from childhood pneumonia and diarrhoea are falling, but action is needed globally and at country level to accelerate the reduction.",

Severe diarrhoea and pneumonia are among the most common reasons for hospital admission in children in low-income and middle-income countries. Despite large reductions in child mortality between 2000 and 2010 (both all-cause mortality, and that specifi cally associated with diarrhoea and pneumonia), these diseases remain major causes of avoidable deaths and account for about 30% of all child deaths worldwide. 1, 2 Thus, achievement of the fourth Millennium Develop ment Goal and the longer-term target 3 of reduction of child mortality to 20 deaths or fewer per 1000 livebirths in all countries by 2035 will necessitate substantial decreases in mortality from the two illnesses. 4 In this fi rst paper in the Series, we review the epidemiological profi le of childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia and present data jointly to inform the planning of integrated control programmes for both illnesses. We bring together previously reported data to compare and contrast the diseases and present new estimates of severe disease, report updated mortality estimates for 2011 (including the estimated number of deaths, by age), and establish how many severe cases and deaths could have been prevented by vaccination.",

We used the median proportion from these studies to estimate the number of severe cases of diarrhoea and pneumonia. Severe diarrhoea was defi ned as disease with moderate or severe dehydration, whereas severe pneumonia was that which was judged by a doctor to necessitate hospital admission. 11, 12 Estimates of mortality from childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia for 2010-11 based on country-level results that were aggregated for regional and global mortality have been published (appendix). 1, 2 For diarrhoea incidence by age, we abstracted agespecifi c incidence and used the expectation-maximisation method to generate regional and global rates. 8 The distribution of pneumonia incidence by age was based on a subset of prospective community-based studies. 8, 10 Median incidences in older age groups (ie, age 1-4 years) were derived in relation to incidence in the fi rst year of life (appendix).

However, for children in low-income and middle-income countries, several episodes per year can lead to nutritional defi cits and long-term consequences. A pooled analysis of nine studies that assessed morbidity and anthropometry showed that the odds of growth stunting by age 2 years increased by 1\u00b713 (95% CI 1\u00b707-1\u00b719) for every fi ve episodes of diarrhoea. 13 The proportion of stunting that could be attributed to fi ve or more episodes of diarrhoea before 2 years of age was 25% . Stunting is an important sequela because it is indicative of long-term nutritional defi cit and is associated with decreased cognitive function. 43 Repeated episodes of diarrhoea can thus lead to cognitive defi cits via stunting, but not independently as some researchers have postulated. 44 Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, and reactive arthritis are rarely noted and are attributable only to selected pathogens (unpublished). 15, 45 A systematic review 14 of pneumonia sequelae showed that the risk of at least one long-term major sequela was 5\u00b75% (95% CI 2\u00b78-8\u00b73) in non-severe pneumonia and 13\u00b76% (6\u00b72-21\u00b71) in severe pneumonia treated in hospital. The most common sequela was reduction in lung volume. Bronchiectasis was reported after 0\u00b79% (0\u00b77-8\u00b77) of cases of severe pneumonia. The risk of major sequelae was higher in children younger than 2 years (13\u00b74% [4\u00b75-22\u00b73]) than in those aged 2-4 years. These fi ndings are consistent with large populationbased studies of children in the early 1990s, 46-48 which showed a 6-7% increased risk of reduced lung capacity after childhood pneumonia. These studies suggested that risk was highest in the fi rst year of life, presumably because of damage to lung parenchyma and bronchioles in an early stage of lung development, which is postulated to impair lung growth and reduce vital capacity and forced expiratory volume. 14 The link between childhood pneumonia and obstructive lung disease is not yet clear. 14",

The yearly rate of change varies substantially between countries, with China reaching 12% for both diseases, whereas other countries have rates that are much less than the fourth Millennium Development Goal target rate of 4\u00b74%. More than ten countries have rates of decline for diarrhoea that are needed to achieve the target of the fourth Millennium Development Goal, but are unable to achieve the same rates for pneumonia (fi gure 2 [lower left quadrant]). Conversely, no countries achieved the target rates for pneumonia but not for diarrhoea. Table 2 presents a breakdown of the global and regional burden of severe episodes of, and deaths from, diarrhoea and pneumonia that are caused by vaccine-preventable pathogens. A full review of the causes of diarrhoea and pneumonia is beyond the scope of this Series paper and will be published elsewhere. 50 The most common cause of severe and fatal diarrhoea worldwide is rotavirus (associated with 28% of severe cases and 28% of fatal cases); the data analysed here are from before the rotavirus vaccine was available, and thus this proportion might be slightly lower in 2011 in the Americas and a few other countries where the vaccine is used (unpublished). V cholerae causes roughly 1% of severe diarrhoea world wide, but is endemic in south Asia and some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The global estimate of cases of severe diarrhoea associated with V cholerae, which is based on available data from a global model, diff ers slightly from that based on regional estimates derived from a subset of regional data (table 2). Because regional estimates are less certain (and thus have wider CIs) than are estimates produced from a global model, we use the global fi gure for the pathogen-specifi c global burden of severe diarrhoea and mortality. The outbreak of cholera that began in October, 2010, in Haiti is not included in these estimates, which are for endemic disease only. 51 Many other viruses (including norovirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus), bacteria (the most common of which are pathogenic Escherichia coli, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Salmonella) and parasites (including Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium) cause severe diarrhoea but cannot be prevented by vaccines. G lamblia and E histolytica do not typically cause severe dehydrating diarrhoea, but Cryptosporidium spp can in some circumstances.",

Additionally, exclusively breastfed infants are exposed less to many pathogens than are infants who are not breastfed or receive mixed feedings. After passive immunity wanes, the child's fi rst exposure to a pathogen often results in severe disease; subsequent illnesses tend to be milder and less likely to result in severe dehydration, admission to hospital, and death. For example, symptomatic rotavirus disease is less common in the first than in the second 6 months of life. 55 The highest rates of severe disease occur at age 6-24 months.

Most data from developing countries are reported from unrepresentative hospital-based studies, which have little relevance in home-birth settings (where most children are born in many countries). [56] [57] [58] [59] Some data from community-based studies in developing countries suggest that Gram-negative rods are the major cause in early neonates (0-6 days), in whom such rods might cause as many as three of every four infections. Klebsiella spp and Staphylococcus aureus, but also Escherichia coli and group B streptococci are thought to be the leading causes in the early neonatal period, when most deaths occur. In the late neonatal and postneonatal periods, Gram-positive cocci (primarily Streptococcus spp) cause about two of every three infections. In the early neonatal period, any of these infections might be environmentally acquired because of unhygienic delivery practices in low-income settings rather than perinatally acquired, which might explain the predominance of Gram-negative infections in home-born infants. [56] [57] [58] [59] However, even hospital-born babies in developing countries have a three times greater to 20 times greater risk of neonatal infections because of poor infection-control practices.

Of these pathogens, P jirovecii and cytomegalovirus pneumonia occur mainly in infants aged 2-6 months. Infections with more than one pathogen or antibiotic-resistant bacteria are more common in HIV-positive than in HIV-negative children, and lead to higher case-fatality ratios. 62, 63 In areas where tuberculosis is endemic, M tuberculosis is an important cause of pneumonia in HIV-positive children and can present as acute severe pneumonia. Chronic lung disease is common (although no accurate estimates are available) in HIV-positive children and is due to bacterial pneumonias responding poorly to treatment, tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lymphoid interstitial pneumonia, or opportunistic fungal infections. 61, 63, 64 Little information is available about the eff ect of HIV infection on neonatal pneumonia. As antiretroviral therapy and co-trimoxazole prophylaxis become more widely used and lead to improved survival of HIV-positive children, severe pneumonia and chronic lung disease can be expected to become more common in older children. facilities in many countries, and inadequate disease surveillance), but has probably decreased as a result of successful immunisation programmes. 54 The causes of diarrhoea and pneumonia vary by age, and diff er particularly in neonates (panel 1) and with disease severity. 65 The HIV/AIDS pandemic has also changed the risk for both diseases and the range of causes in countries with high prevalences of HIV infection. Table 3 shows the eff ect sizes for specifi c confi rmed biological risk factors for diarrhoea and pneumonia. Because identifi cation of individual risk relations is complex when several risk factors exist, we present results from multivariable analyses whenever possible. Diarrhoea and pneumonia share many risk factors, such as not exclusively breastfeeding infants younger than 6 months, undernutrition, and zinc defi ciency. Vitamin A defi ciency increases the risk of severe diarrhoea and thus diarrhoea mortality (relative risk [RR] 1\u00b75, 95% CI 1\u00b73-1\u00b78), 66 but is not an important risk factor for the incidence of diarrhoea or pneumonia, or for pneumoniarelated mortality. 66 Other factors, such as intrauterine growth restriction and prematurity, are risk factors for all-cause neonatal mortality, but cause-specifi c data are not available and thus risk relations cannot be quantifi ed. 67 Risk relations between specifi c water and sanitation risk factors (ie, unwashed hands and poor water quality) and diarrhoea morbidity and mortality have been shown, but for some outcomes, such as inappropriate excreta disposal, poor availability of evidence permits only rough estimates of risk. 68, 69 Crowding and exposure to indoor air pollution in crease pneumonia incidence, but are not associated with increased risk for diarrhoea morbidity or mortality. Various defi nitions and outcomes were used in studies of crowding, [70] [71] [72] [73] but eff ects on pneumonia were consistently moderate. Exposure to indoor air pollution from solid fuel combustion increases the incidence of pneumonia by 80% (95% CI . In a small group of studies, 74 exposure to indoor air pollution (various defi nitions of risk were used) was associated with increased risk of severe pneumonia and pneumonia mortality; additional studies are needed before a combined analysis can be done to produce a risk estimate. In a randomised controlled trial 75 Data only available for ages 6-11 months for this risk relation. \u2021Mix of cohort, observational and case-control studies; analysis done with unadjusted risk estimates. \u00a7Prospective datasets adjusted for socioeconomic and non-nutritional determinants of mortality. \u00b6Meta-analysis of observed risk reductions from supplementation trials. ||Meta-analysis of observed risk reductions from randomised controlled trials. non-signifi cant reductions in the incidence of pneumonia compared with those who continued to use open fi res (RR 0\u00b784, 95% CI 0\u00b763-1\u00b713); however, in an exposureresponse analysis the reduction was signifi cant (0\u00b782, 0\u00b770-0\u00b798). Diarrhoea and pneumonia have each been investigated as independent risk factors for increasing the risk of simultaneous or sequential infection with each other. Schmidt and colleagues 76 assessed the eff ect of cumulative time ill with diarrhoea on subsequent respiratory infections in cohorts of children from Ghana and Brazil. In Ghanaian children, a time-to-event analysis showed that, as the daily prevalence of diarrhoea increased, the risk of a subsequent acute lower-respiratory-tract infection increased by 1\u00b708 (95% CI 1\u00b70-1\u00b715) per day of diarrhoea. Yet, a similar fi nding was not noted in the Brazilian cohort. In neither country was the reverse relation-ie, pneumonia as a risk for diarrhoea-noted. In a similar analysis of two cohorts, one of Indian and the other of Nepali children, Fischer Walker and coworkers 77 reported that, as the number of days with diarrhoea increased, the incidence of acute lower-respiratory-tract infections increased. Acute lower-respiratory-tract infections were only a risk factor for diarrhoea in a stratifi ed subgroup of infants younger than 6 months.",

In a subgroup of countries in which rates of mortality from diarrhoea and pneumonia are falling slowly, child deaths continue to rise because of high birth rates. For example, in Burkina Faso, the estimated rates of diarrhoea and pneumonia specifi c mortality fell from 2000 to 2010, yet the estimated number of deaths in children younger than 5 years increased (from 13 447 to 14 648 for diarrhoea and 17 389 to 21 763 for pneumonia); we note similar trends in Afghanistan, Cameroon, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Mali. Within regions, disparities exist between countries that have achieved rapid reductions in mortality for both diarrhoea and pneumonia and those that have not. In Cambodia, for example, diarrhoea mortality rates have been falling by 12% and pneumonia mortality rates by 8% each year from 2000 to 2010fi ndings which contrast with yearly decreases of 2\u00b74% and 1\u00b76% in Papua New Guinea.

Oral cholera vaccines are eff ective in endemic regions where epidemics are common but are not yet widely used in emergency settings. As more data showing the benefi ts of vaccination are generated, the absence of widespread use, especially in settings where prevention and control are challenging, is becoming questionable. 94 For more on humanitarian emergencies see http://www. unhcr.org for diarrhoea in Peru associated with El Ni\u00f1o in 1997-98, suggesting that if ambient temperatures increase because of climate change, admissions associated with diarrhoea could be expected to rise. Pneumonia has also been postulated to be a climate-sensitive disease that is likely to be aff ected substantially by pronounced climate change. 107 Incidence in many settings is strongly associated with rainfall, and thus the predicted increased intensity rainy seasons in Asia, Africa, the western Pacifi c region, and parts of South America in the future will probably be associated with a raised burden of childhood pneumonia. 108 However, the true scale of these eff ects is unknown.",
