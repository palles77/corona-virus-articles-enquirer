HRVs were previously divided into 2 genetic groups, HRV-A (n = 75) and HRV-B (n = 25). Recently, a putative new and distinct rhinovirus group, HRV-C, has been reportedly found in some patients with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . To extend these initial fi ndings and assess the pathogenicity of HRV-C, we investigated its prevalence as well as its clinical and molecular features in children with lower acute RTIs in Beijing, People's Republic of China.",

The children were 1 month to 15 years of age (mean age 37 months, median age 10 months). Nucleic acids were extracted from clinical samples by using the NucliSens easyMAG platform (bioM\u00e9rieux SA, Marcy L'Etoile, France). Each specimen was tested for the presence of common respiratory viruses: human parainfl uenza viruses 1-4, infl uenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, enteroviruses, human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, HKU1, and OC43), metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, and bocaviruses. To study the prevalence of HRV-C, we designed a specifi c reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) that generated a 330-bp PCR product encompassing a portion of the 5\u2032-untranslated region, the full virus capsid protein (VP) 4 gene, and a portion of the VP2 gene of the HRV-C genome.

In 6 of the 14 patients, HRV-C was the only virus detected, which suggests a direct correlation between HRV-C infection and lower acute RTIs. In the remaining 8 patients, other respiratory viruses were also detected. Respiratory syncytial virus, the most important cause of lower acute RTIs in children, was codetected in 7 of the HRV-Cpositive patients, and human parainfl uenza virus 3 was codetected in the other patient. Human coronavirus NL63 was codetected with respiratory syncytial virus in 1 HRV-C-positive patient.",

In contrast, HRV-A and HRV-B were detected in each month (data not shown). Indeed, from July through December, HRV-A and HRV-B viruses were detected in 34 and 12 patients, respectively. Notably, in October 2007, HRV-C was detected in 7 patients, while HRV-A and HRV-B were detected in 5 and 2 patients, respectively, which suggests that the cluster of cases of HRV infections during this month was caused mainly by HRV-C.",

Six sequences (BCH221, BCH264, BCH200, BCH341, BCH217, and BCH250) displayed high similarity to HRV C025 (EF582386) from Hong Kong (4); 2 sequences (BCH249 and BCH343) displayed high similarity to NAT083 (EF077264) from the United States (3) and Picornaviridae strain 06-646 (EU081811) from Germany (5) . BCH242 was similar to Picornaviridae strain tu403 (EU081795) from Germany (5) . The other 5 strains were homologous to strains from Australia (EU155152-EU155154, EU155158) (2,7). These fi ndings suggest that, as in other countries (5), the HRV-C strains circulating in China are diverse. Although HRV-C strains belonging to different gene clusters cocirculate, some genetically close strains dominated during certain periods, e.g., the C025-like strain (6/14) was dominant during the study period. A similar distribution pattern is observed in epidemics of HRV-A and HRV-B (9,10).",

The location of the QRDR in gyrase and topoisomerase IV genes was based upon prior studies in meningococci (online Appendix Table) and on the complete sequence of strain N. meningitidis Z2491 (serogroup A; Gen-Bank accession no. NC_003116). We amplifi ed and sequenced extended regions encompassing the QRDRs by using the upstream and downstream primer pairs in gyrA (522 bases) 5\u2032-GTTCCGCGTCAAAATATGCT-3\u2032, 5\u2032-CCGAAATTGACGGTTTCTTC-3\u2032; gyrB (649 bases) 5\u2032-GGTTTGACC TGCGTGTTGTC-3\u2032, 5\u2032-CGGCTGG GCGATATAGATG-3\u2032; parC (635 bases) 5\u2032-CACTATGGTTTGCCGT TTTG-3\u2032, 5\u2032-ATTTCGGACAACAG CAATTC-3\u2032; and parE (610 bases) 5\u2032-GGACAGGATGGCGATTTTG-3\u2032, 5\u2032-CGTCAGCAACTTCATCAACC-3\u2032.
