Because viral RNAs often lack canonical caps or poly-A tails, 25 they can also be vulnerable to degradation by these host exonucleases. Yeast lack 26 sophisticated mechanisms of innate and adaptive immunity, but do use RNA 27 degradation as an antiviral defense mechanism. One model is that the RNA of yeast 28 viruses is subject to degradation simply as a side effect of the intrinsic exonuclease 29 activity of proteins involved in RNA metabolism. Contrary to this model, we find a highly 30 refined, species-specific relationship between Xrn1p and the \"L-A\" totiviruses of different 31 Saccharomyces yeast species. We show that the gene XRN1 has evolved rapidly under 32 positive natural selection in Saccharomyces yeast, resulting in high levels of Xrn1p 33 protein sequence divergence from one yeast species to the next. We also show that 34 these sequence differences translate to differential interactions with the L-A virus, where 35 Xrn1p from S. cerevisiae is most efficient at controlling the L-A virus that chronically 36 infects S. cerevisiae, and Xrn1p from S. kudriavzevii is most efficient at controlling the L-37 A-like virus that we have discovered within S. kudriavzevii. All Xrn1p orthologs are 38 equivalent in their interaction with another virus-like parasite, the Ty1 retrotransposon.",

To thwart XRN1, the totiviruses are known to 540 synthesize uncapped RNAs with an exposed 5' diphosphate, which is a suboptimal 541 substrate for Xrn1p-mediated decay [24] . Further, it has been shown that the totivirus 542 Gag protein has a cap-snatching activity that cleaves off caps from host mRNAs and 543 uses them to cap viral transcripts, protecting them from Xrn1p degradation [12, 14] . We 544 have found that Xrn1p interacts with L-A Gag, and that this interaction is not mediated by 545 the presence of single-stranded RNAs. What remains unknown is whether Xrn1p is 546 targeting Gag as part of the restriction mechanism, or whether Gag is targeting Xrn1p as 547 a counter defense. As we did not observe an obvious species-specific differences in the 548 interaction between Xrn1p and L-A Gag by coimmunoprecipitation, we cannot clearly 549 define the observed role of sequence variation in Xrn1p.

There are several possible interpretations. First, Gag might be 428 antagonizing Xrn1p rather than being the species-specific target of Xrn1. Second, there 429 may be a third component in this interaction which makes manifest the species-430 specificity of Xrn1p. Finally, a trivial explanation could be that coimmunoprecipitations 431 are not very quantitative, and maybe there is in fact a difference in interaction with Gag 432 between the Xrn1p of different species.

Prevailing wisdom assumes that infection of fungi by viruses is 593 largely asymptomatic and benign, especially when considering that their intracellular and static. Firstly, there is a measurable fitness cost to killer toxin production by S. 607 cerevisiae within unfavorable environmental conditions that inactivate the toxin, allow for 608 regular cellular dispersal and/or are nutrient rich [69,70]. Secondly, virus infection of 609 pathogenic fungi can also cause hypovirulence (a reduction in fungal pathogenesis), an 610 outcome that is being exploited to treat agricultural disease [74-77]. Thirdly, many wild 611 and domesticated strains of S. cerevisiae are free of totiviruses (and therefore also of 612 killer), suggesting that there is selection against the ongoing maintenance of these 613 viruses [20,28,71]. Fourthly, the continued maintenance of RNAi systems in fungi also 614 correlates with the loss of the killer phenotype and is known to antagonize fungal viruses 615 [71,78]. However, a virus of the fungi Cryphonectria parasitica has been shown to 616 antagonize and escape restriction by RNAi without crippling its host [78]. This 617 antagonistic relationship appears similar to the equilibrium of Saccharomyces yeasts 618 and totiviruses, and suggests that in the absence of effective RNAi, additional antiviral 619 defenses may be biologically relevant (i.e. Xrn1p). In line with this view of a dynamic 620 relationship between hosts and intracellular viruses, we show that totiviruses from 621 different Saccharomyces species are best controlled by the Xrn1p of their cognate 622 species, and that disruption of this equilibrium can result in excessive virus replication 623",

For example, the antagonistic interaction of Ebola virus (and/or 637 related filoviruses) with the bat cell surface receptor, Niemann-Pick disease, type C1 638 (NPC1), has driven the rapid evolution of the receptor without affecting the transport of 639 cholesterol, critical to the health of the host [33]. Numerous such examples highlight how 640 essential housekeeping machineries, not just the immune system, are critical for 641 protecting the cell from replicating viruses. This study highlights an interesting 642 evolutionary conundrum that does not apply to classical immunity genes: as Xrn1p 643 appears to be an antiviral protein, it must be able to evolve new antiviral specificities 644 without compromising cellular health and homeostasis. from S. cerevisiae, including 1000 bp of the 5' and 3' UTRs, was amplified by 649 PCR from genomic DNA prepared from S. cerevisiae S288C. This PCR product was 650 cloned into the plasmid pAG425-GAL-ccdB by the \"yeast plasmid construction by 651 homologous recombination\" method (recombineering) [84] to produce pPAR219. Briefly, 652 pAG425-GAL-ccdB was amplified by PCR to produce a 5000 bp product lacking the 653 GAL-1 gene and the ccdB cassette.

Utilizing Gateway TM technology (Thermo Fisher), XRN1 genes were 669 sub-cloned into the destination vector pAG426-GAL-ccdB for over-expression studies 670 [85].
