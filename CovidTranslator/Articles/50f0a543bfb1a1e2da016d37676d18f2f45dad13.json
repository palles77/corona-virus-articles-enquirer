            "text": "Although winter dysentery (WD), which is caused by the bovine coronavirus (BCoV) is characterized by the sudden onset of diarrhea in many adult cattle in a herd, the pathogenesis of the WD-BCoV is not completely understood. In this study, colostrumdeprived calves were experimentally infected with a Korean WD-BCoV strain and examined for viremia, enteric and nasal virus shedding as well as for viral antigen expression and virus-associated lesions in the small and large intestines and the upper and lower respiratory tract from 1 to 8 days after an oral infection. The WD-BCoV-inoculated calves showed gradual villous atrophy in the small intestine and a gradual increase in the crypt depth of the large intestine. The WD-BCoV-infected animals showed epithelial damage in nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs, and interstitial pneumonia. The WD-BCoV antigen was detected in the epithelium of the small and large intestines, nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. WD-BCoV RNA was detected in the serum from post-inoculation day 3. These results show that the WD-BCoV has dual tropism and induces pathological changes in both the digestive and respiratory tracts of calves. To our knowledge, this is the first detailed report of dual enteric and respiratory tropisms of WD-BCoV in calves. Comprehensive studies of the dual tissue pathogenesis of the BCoV might contribute to an increased understanding of similar pneumoenteric CoV infections in humans.",

            "text": "The coronaviruses (CoV) constitute a genus in the family Coronaviridae, large enveloped viruses ranging in diameter from 100 to 120 nm, that possess a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 27-32 kb in length and cause important diseases in animals [23] . Coronaviruses (CoVs) can be divided into three distinct groups according to their natural hosts, nucleotide sequences, and serologic relationships [23] . The bovine CoV (BCoV), which belongs to the CoV group 2a, contains five major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N), the transmembrane, the spike (S), the small membrane and the hemagglutinin=esterase (HE) proteins, the latter being unique to some group 2 CoVs [23] . Although both S and HE glycoproteins of the BCoV use Nacetyl-9-O acetyl neuraminic acid as a receptor determinant to initiate an infection, the S glycoprotein requires a smaller amount of these receptors on the surface of erythrocytes for agglutination than the HE protein [32, 33] . Therefore, the S glycoprotein is the major hemagglutinin of BCoV [32] and is believed to be responsible for the primary attachment of BCoV to other cell surface receptors [33] . Consequently, the variation in the host range and tissue tropism of CoVs may largely be due to variations in the S gycoprotein [15] .",

In addition, the virus has been associated with a new proposed clinical form, warmer season dysentery in adult cattle [27] . Because the porcine respiratory CoV emerged from porcine transmissible gastroenteritis CoV (TGEV) through deletion mutations with reduced enteropathogenicity and a loss of hemagglutinating activity [29] but pronounced tropism for lung tissue, many attempts have been made to isolate and identify a potential deletion mutant of BCoV with altered tissue tropism or virulence. Despite their involvement in the different clinical forms, only minor variations in the S and HE genes among the strains associated with CD, WD, and bovine respiratory CoV (BRCoV) have been reported [9] . Moreover, only one serotype has been identified in the BCoV isolates or strains, even though the data obtained from serological studies, using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, suggested the existence of serologically different subtypes of BCoV [40] . Animals that have recovered from an infection with the BRCoV, CD, or WD strains were protected from BCoV-associated diarrhea after a challenge exposure to either a hetero-logous or homologous strain of the BCoV [6] , which suggests that only one BCoV serotype exists [40] .",

The WD-affected cattle lose body condition, resulting in a dramatic decrease in milk production, and many animals show signs of respiratory disease (nasal discharge) [30] . Recently, WD was successfully reproduced experimentally in BCoV-seronegative adult cattle and calves [39] . However, the digestive and respiratory pathogenesis of WD-BCoV in calves is so far unknown. This study attempted to answer the following three questions: 1) where in the digestive tract of calves does WD-BCoV replicate and cause pathological changes? 2) does WD-BCoV replicate and cause damage to the respiratory tract of calves? 3) if so, in which cells of the respiratory tract does WD-BCoV replicate and cause damage? Accordingly, the digestive tract (small and large intestine) and the respiratory tracts including the nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs, were sampled from colostrumdeprived (Cols-D) calves inoculated with a Korean WD strain, KWD3, and analyzed for BCoV antigens by histopathology and immunohistochemistry, as well as by a scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the level of fecal and nasal virus shedding (detected by RT-PCR, nested PCR and ELISA) was assessed. The results of this study suggest that WD-BCoV has dual tropism for the digestive and respiratory tracts of calves and induces pathological changes in these tissues by destroying the epithelium.",

The small intestines exhibited long and slender villi with short crypts (Fig. 1A and B) . The large intestines contained intestinal glands, which were elongated, straight and open to the luminal surface (Fig. 1C ). In contrast, the BCoVinoculated calves showed mild to severe villous atrophy, widespread villous fusion and increased crypt depth in the small intestine ( Fig. 1D and E) , and moderate atrophy of the intestinal glands with severe epithelial desquamation in the large intestine (Fig. 1F ) in the multiple cross sections. Table 2 summarizes the histological changes in the small and large intestines from the virusinoculated calves. At PID 1, mild villous atrophy caused by necrosis and the desquamation of villous epithelial cells was confined in the duodenum. With time, the duodenal lesions became increasingly severe, and other parts of the intestine showed milder epithelial changes. Eventually, the duodenum showed severe villous atrophy and the other parts of the intestines including the jejunum, ileum, cecum, colon and rectum had moderate to marked mucosal lesions at PID 8 ( Fig. 1D-F) . (ii) Respiratory tract. The calves inoculated with mock-inactivated BCoV did not exhibit any changes. They had pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with goblet cells in the nasal turbinates, trachea and bronchus ( Fig. 2A) .",

Although BCoV is believed to replicate in the epithelium of the respiratory tract [5] [6] [7] 31 ], the precise regions or cells where BCoV replicates are still unknown. This study demonstrated that WD-BCoV has tropism for the epithelium of the nasal turbinates, trachea and lungs. Moreover, mild to severe interstitial pneumonia was detected in the BCoV-inoculated calves, suggesting that the WD-BCoV induces interstitial pneumonia. Some pneumotropic viruses, e.g. feline CoV and canine distemper virus, cause necrosis of the alveolar epithelium, which can lead to compensatory hyperplasia of the type II pneumocytes as well as the infiltration of macrophages and lymphoid cells into the interstitium, resulting in interstitial pneumonia [10, 21] . Since this study showed that WD-BCoV replicated and damaged the alveolar epithelium, the interstitial pneumonia induced by WD-BCoV might occur through a similar mechanism. However, unlike SARS-CoV, WD-BCoV showed stronger enterotropism than respiratory tro-pism [34] . Moreover, WD-BCoV caused dual lesions in the small and large intestines, even though the lesions in small intestine were more severe than those of the large intestine.",

Although the present BCoV caused cytopathic effects to the digestive and respiratory epithelia, its mechanisms are poorly understood, particularly in early infections. The BCoV was reported to cause a loss of microvilli in the in-testinal epithelium of a BCoV-inoculated calf sacrificed 3 h after inoculation [26] , resulting in diarrhea in experimentally inoculated and naturally infected calves. However, the present histological, IHC and SEM studies do not allow a rigorous reconstruction of the sequence of the loss of microvilli during the initial WD-BCoV infections of the digestive tract because transmission electron and immuno-electron microscopic studies were not performed. These analyses would be particularly useful with the specimens sampled 3 h after inoculation, which presumably would have provided more detailed data on their multiplication and fine structural changes. It has been reported [22] that some mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) strains rapidly reduce the level of actin mRNA, whose protein interacts with microtubules. As a consequence, the virus-induced impairment of the actin filaments interacting with microtubules might lose their connection with the plasma membrane covering the microvillus or anchored cilia, resulting in the loss of microvilli or cilia [4] . In addition, TGEV and some MHV strains induce apoptosis in some cell types [1, 12] . Therefore, it is possible that the loss of microvilli and cilia induced by WD-BCoV in the digestive and respiratory tracts might occur through a similar mechanisms such as a combination of MHV-or TGEV-induced effects [23] .",
