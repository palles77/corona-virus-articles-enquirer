The purpose of the study was synthesis and investigation of antiviral activity of camphor-based symmetric diimines and diamines. A set of C2-symmetric nitrogen-containing camphor derivatives have been synthesized. The antiviral activity of these compounds was studied against rimantadine-and amantadine-resistant influenza virus A/California/7/ 09 (H1N1)pdm09 in MDCK cells. The highest efficacy in virus inhibiting was shown for compounds 2a-e with cage moieties bound by aliphatic linkers. The therapeutic index (selectivity index) for 2b exceeded that for reference compounds amantadine, deitiforin and rimantadine almost 10-fold. As shown by structure-activity analysis, the length of the linker has a dramatic effect on the toxicity of compounds.",

Approximately half of novel drugs approved for clinical use in USA are the naturally derived compounds and their modified derivatives. 2 There are currently few antivirals against influenza infection, for most of which fast emergence of drug resistance has been documented. 3 For this reason, creation of novel effective antivirals with the alternative mechanism and broad spectrum of activity is one of the most important goals in the field of treatment and prophylaxis of influenza.",

As a result, its antigenic structure is highly variable due to selective pressure of host immune response. In addition, the presence of specific antivirals also serves as a selective factor resulting in fast emergence of drug-resistant virus strains. Taken together, these processes lead to the selection of viral variants that are capable both of escaping the immune inactivation by neutralizing antibodies and of overcoming the suppressive action of antiviral drugs.",

            "text": "Three chemical classes of compounds are currently used as antiinfluenza drugs. They are targeted against different stages of viral life cycle in infected cells. Among them, the most commonly used compounds include neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir (Relenza \u00d2 ), oseltamivir (Tamiflu \u00d2 ), peramivir (Rapiacta \u00d2 ), and laninamivir (Inavir \u00d2 ). 4 They interfere with the activity of viral neuraminidase, which plays an essential role in the release of progeny virus particles from the surface of a host cell. Ribavirin and favipiravir are antivirals of broad range of activity, which exhibit a suppressive effect against almost all RNA-genome human viruses. 5 numerous side effects, including the reduction of haemoglobin level, neutropenia, pulmonary edema, etc. 6 Adamantane derivatives, which were first discovered as specific anti-influenza drugs with the direct mechanism of activity are represented by two compounds: Rimantadine (a-methyl-1-adamantylamine hydrochloride) and amantadine (1-aminoadamantane). 7 These compounds block virally encoded protein M2 that acts as a proton channel required for acidification of the virion core, and thus prevent hemagglutinin cleavage and further fusion of membranes of the viral envelope and lysosomal vacuole necessary for virus decapsidation. 8, 9 Despite high initial efficacy of adamantanes as anti-influenza drugs, drug-resistant strains can be easily selected both in vitro and in patients receiving adamantane-based therapy. 10 Adamantane resistance among circulating influenza A viruses increased rapidly worldwide starting from 2003 to 2004. The percentage of adamantane-resistant influenza A virus isolates increased from 0.4% in 1994-1995 to 92% in 2005-2006 influenza season. 11 The resistance is mainly conferred by amino acid substitutions in M2 protein L26F, V27A, S31N and G34E. 12 Being widely used cage structures, adamantanes were used for the rational design of a large class of antiviral compounds. 13 In particular, attempts were undertaken to overcome the adamantaneresistance of influenza virus. Among them, aminospiroadamantanes, although inactive against the mutant S31N, were revealed to be a submicromolar inhibitor of the clinically important mutant V27A (IC 50 = 0.31 lM) and also showed to be active against the mutant L26F (IC 50 = 5.6 lM). 14 Bananins, which have been shown to possess an inhibitory activity against SARS coronavirus, are the closest compounds to classical adamantanes. 15 More widely, cage structures appeared promising core structures for the development of novel antivirals. Among them, Deitiforin (2-(1 0 -aminoethyl)bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane) is one of the most interesting drugs based on natural cage compounds, bornanes (Fig. 1) . 16 In this regard, it is important to note that this compound is in fact of natural origin and that borneol and isoborneol have been widely known in folk medicine as antiinflammatory compounds. 17 Natural compounds, including monoterpenoids, are a promising source of new antiviral compounds. 18, 19 Oxygen-containing monoterpenoid with a para-menthane framework showed a significant activity against the influenza virus, 20 nitrogen containing compounds based on the hydrochlorides of 1-and 2-adamantylamines and monoterpene aldehydes demonstrated antiviral activity against the influenza virus higher than that of rimantadine and amantadine. 21 Meanwhile, it is known that Schiff bases are among the most important groups of biomolecules. These compounds have been found to reveal both remarkable biological activities and a variety of valuable practical applications. 22, 23 The aim of this work was to synthesize new nitrogen containing compounds, including Schiff bases and amines, based on camphor and to study their antiviral activity against rimantadine-resistant influenza virus A/California/07/09 (H1N1)pdm09.",

Camphor is an inexpensive natural compound, one of the first plant metabolites isolated in the chemically pure form. For a long time, the technology for isolating this compound from camphor tree wood has been known in China in Japan. The analeptic properties of camphor have been known since the 18th century. Today, it is used to treat acute and chronic heart failure, respiratory depression, soporific and narcotic poisoning, as well as an agent for topical use. 24 A typical feature of a camphor molecule is its cage-hydrocarbon (rigid) structure that is similar to a certain extent to that of adamantane. Having the nearly spherical structure, adamantane derivatives, amantadine and rimantadine, exhibit high penetrability through the cell membrane and, hence, high antiviral activity.",

S31N is the most widely distributed mutation among drug-resistant strains.

This can be illustrated by comparing of three compounds, diimines 2b,c,e and their derivatives diamines 3b,c,e. Despite low effective concentrations of 3b,c,e their toxicity is much higher than that for 2. This results in lower SI values. In summary, symmetric diimines 2a-e should be considered as a highly promising class of compounds effective against influenza.",
