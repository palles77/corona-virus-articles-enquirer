By introducing the social preference theory, the target of this paper is to reveal the micro-interaction mechanism of public opinion polarization. Firstly, we divide the social preferences of Internet users (network nodes) into three categories: egoistic, altruistic, and fair preferences, and adopt the revenue function to define the benefits obtained by individuals with different preferences among their interaction process so as to analyze their decision-making behaviors driven by the revenue. Secondly, the revenue function is used to judge the exit rules of nodes in a network, and then a dynamic network of spreading public opinion with the node (individual) exit mechanism is built based on a BA scale-free network. Subsequently, the influences of different social preferences, as well as individual revenue on the effect of public opinion polarization, are analyzed through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that (1) Different social preferences demonstrate different influences on the evolution of public opinions, (2) Individuals tend to interact with ones with different preferences, (3) The network with a single preference or a high aggregation is more likely to form public opinion polarization. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by a real case.",

When people communicate in forums or discussion groups, fierce disputes or mutual affirmation of different views will lead to the popularity of public opinion and generate one or more extreme attitude values, which are called public opinion polarization. Generally speaking, the effective usage of public opinion polarization can improve the public's trust in government, and also increase customer loyalty to enterprises [1] . For example, in the Spring Festival of 2020, when China's novel coronavirus broke out, the Henan provincial government acted decisively and responded effectively. Soon afterwards, topics such as \"How to Steal the Governor of Henan Province\" and \"Henan Province hand over the full score answer sheet\" appeared in the network to occupy the top of the hot search list, which greatly enhanced the credibility of the Henan provincial government. However, since every coin has two sides, the phenomenon of public opinion polarization also easily results in network violence and even extends such behavior from online to offline, such as sit-downs, protest marches, and other social group behaviors that are not conducive to social stability. As a result, research on the emergence mechanism of public opinion polarization is of important theoretical and practical significance.",

            "text": "At present, there are relatively few studies on the public opinion polarization, and most of them mainly adopt methods such as macro statistics [2] or mathematical modeling [3, 4] to analyze the main characteristics of the formation and propagation of polarization phenomena at the macro level. However, these methods generally lack studies on the interaction mechanism of micro individuals. In fact, only by fully exploring the internal driving force for individuals to participate in the interaction of views in the network, as well as analyzing the direct reasons behind their decision-making behaviors, can the internal mechanism of polarization phenomenon be further understood. In the process of micro-individual interactions, every individual is different, which makes him/her have different social preferences. These differentiated social preferences will bring different revenues for individuals to participate in the interactions, thus prompting them to take different interactive behaviors driven by revenues, and ultimately affecting public opinion polarization on the whole network. Currently, the social preference theory [5, 6] has widely applied to individual behavioral decisions in the field of social and economic activities but is rarely used in the field of public opinion evolution. In this paper, we introduce the social preference theory and build a public opinion polarization model for analyzing individual interaction behavior from the perspective of gain for different individuals. As far as we know, it is the first time that the social preference theory has been adopted for public opinion polarization. Subsequently, the effects of different social preferences, network structure, and individual revenues on public opinion polarization are explored by simulation experiments and some observations are obtained through simulation experiments. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by a real case.",

            "text": "For research on group polarization, Professor Sunstein [1] proposed in 2002 that if there was some bias in the opinions of group members at the beginning, such bias would be strengthened after discussion, and finally, an extreme opinion would be formed, which is the public opinion polarization. Subsequently, many scholars have also studied the phenomenon of public opinion polarization and have made some achievements. For example, Liu et al. [7] studied the overconfidence problem in viewpoint interactions among different individuals in 2019 and proposed that overconfidence would have a negative impact on large-scale group decision-making and reduce the consistency of decision-making. In 2017, Dong et al. [8] explored the issue of consensus under the guidance of multiple leaders and found that the dynamic change process of leaders could promote public opinion polarization. Dandekar et al. [9] proposed in 2013 that if individuals in the network had enough prejudice at the initial moment, such prejudice would lead to public opinion polarization after a lot of interactions. Etesami and Basar [10] studied the public opinion polarization phenomenon in high dimensions in 2014 and found that whether it forms single polarization, bi-polarization, or multi-polarization depended on the openness of the mind. In 2013, Li et al. [11] discussed the internal characteristics of the gradual shift of public opinion from bi-polarization to single polarization by analyzing its convergence characteristics. Leon-Medini [12] established a new multi-agent model to study the final trend of public opinion evolution in 2019. In 2017, by comparing networks with different structures, Li and Xiao [13] found that the increase of average network would raise the polarization degree, and the viewpoints of different dimensions would affect each other in the network evolution, thus reducing the polarization phenomenon. In 2019, Chen et al. [14] considered the influence of heterogeneous individuals in the network on the public opinion polarization, and also introduced the concept of dynamic conformity to discuss the influence of \"silent spiral\" phenomenon on the polarization of public opinion. However, the driving force for individuals to participate in the interaction was not considered in the above paper.",

However, studies are rarely related to individual interaction mechanisms at the micro level. Due to the complexity of netizens, there are many influence factors involved in their interactions, so quantitative analysis is difficult to deal with in this issue. Considering that every individual is driven by revenue during interactions, individuals are only willing to engage in perspective interactions when they can obtain certain benefits. Individuals with different social preferences have diverse benefits from each interaction. Based on this, the benefits brought by different preferences can explain the essential motivations of the different behavior choices of individuals in public opinion communication. Therefore, it is of great practical significance to use the social preference theory to study the public opinion polarization phenomenon so as to better explain the interrelationships among various factors that affect the public opinion polarization phenomenon.",

[16] studied the relationship between offline social interaction and online shopping. In 2016, Szczecinska-Musielak [17] discussed the usefulness of social conflict theory as a theoretical framework for analyzing the conflict in Northern Ireland. In 2018, Cuppen [18] emphasized the value of social conflict in energy policy and planning and discussed several basic characteristics of social conflict. Zhou [19] proposed in 2019 that social support, including information support and emotional support, had a significant impact on social influence. Peng et al. [20] presented an evaluation model to measure both direct and indirect influence based on the social relationship graph, by introducing friend entropy and interaction frequency entropy to describe the complexity and uncertainty of social influence. All the above literature study network public opinion from macro perspectives and mainly use qualitative methods to analyze opinion evolution. However, micro individual interactions can determine the macro emergence of group behavior. As a result, it is necessary to explore public opinion polarization from micro individual interactions. That is why we introduce social preference theory to measure individual revenues in interactions.",

            "text": "In addition, some scholars have attempted to explain the evolution mechanism of public opinion through the preference theory. For instance, in 2015, Alizadeh et al. [21] investigated the interplay of homophily, rejection, and in-group cooperation drivers on the formation of opinion clusters and the emergence of extremist, radical opinions. Their model was to explicitly explore the effect of in-group favoritism on the macro-level, collective behavior of opinions. In 2019, Banisch and Olbrich [22] analytically characterized sufficient conditions for the stability of bi-polarization with the consideration of the social feedback process. Comparing with previous models, their model highlighted an effective experience-based route to polarization. In 2019, Dong et al. [23] believed that while interacting with their views, interlocutors often hid their real preferences and expressed different preferences to different persons. Furthermore, by dividing the individual preferences into real preference, communication preference, and public preference, they studied the deceptive interaction and the preference evolution of heterogeneous trust in the network. In 2018, Navarro-Martinez et al. [24] incorporated the expected utility theory to build a model of the dynamic preference where the preferences selected by the decision-makers for each interaction were recorded and compared with the previous preferences. In 2018, Guevara et al. [25] measured the dynamic change of individual preference values during interaction by establishing a continuous opinion space. In 2010 and 2014, Cabrerizo et al. [26, 27] described a concept of a granular fuzzy preference relation and gave the influence of individual preference on decision results in a fuzzy group. In 2007, Herrera-Viedma et al. [28] studied the impact of information shortage for incomplete fuzzy preference relations. P\u00e9rez et al. [29] presented a novel model in 2016 that gathered the experts' initial opinions and provided a framework to represent the influence of a given expert over the other(s). With this proposal, it was feasible to estimate both the evolution of the group decision-making process and the final solution before carrying out the group discussion process and consequently foreseeing possible actions. In 2018, Gayle and Khorunzhina [30] put forward an extended model based on fuzzy consensus while evaluating resources. By this model, rational decisions could be made so as to reduce the impact of individual preference on evaluation accuracy. Barseghyan et al. [31] studied the family risk preferences through expectation utility theory in 2016. All these studies mentioned above are of great significance to the field of public opinion, but they mainly focus on qualitative analysis and lack quantitative modeling and analysis process, leading to shortages of intuitiveness and validity of the characterization of complex and changeable public opinion evolution.",

Actually, the interaction of micro individuals determines the emergence of macro groups. At present, studies on the applications of social preference theory to the phenomenon of public opinion polarization are still rare. During the public opinion evolution, individuals with different preferences will get different benefits, which will drive them to make different decisions while interacting with each other. However, the diverse interaction behaviors of these individuals ultimately lead to different public opinion polarization effects. In addition, in terms of individual interaction, the intimacy and friendliness of the participants must be considered. In general, individuals tend to interact with ones with similar views or close friendships, and their interaction yields will be higher. Therefore, this paper firstly introduces the concept of the intimacy as well as friendliness and then establishes individual revenue function. Subsequently, a new public opinion polarization model to explore opinion propagation rule is set up. In addition, according to the individual revenue function, a network structure considering node exit mechanism is built on the basis of a BA scale-free network [32] , which expands the static network in previous studies [33, 34] into the dynamic one, making it more realistic. Finally, the influences of different social preferences and individual revenue functions on the public opinion polarization effects are analyzed through simulation experiments, and a real case is also given to verify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model.",

In a social network, the phenomenon that \"friends of friends are your friends\" often occurs, and two individuals with more common friends tend to be closer than two ones with fewer common friends. Therefore, we assume that the intimacy between two individuals is positively correlated with the number of mutual friends. However, as shown in Figure 4c , since the number of individuals connected with agent j (see blue lines in Figure 4c ) is larger than that connected with agent i (green line), agent i and agent j have different intimacy degrees in spite of the same number of common friends between them. Assuming that the number of individuals connected to agent i in a network is N i , and also, the number connected to agent j is N ij in N i (N ij = N ji ), then the intimacy degree of agent i and agent j, h ij , is expressed as follows:",

When an individual i interacts with j in a network, if the revenue he/she obtains is very small, then at the next moment, individual i will not want to interact with j anymore.

Based on this, individuals with altruistic preferences have a greater willingness to interact in the network, and this willingness will be further increased after multiple interactions, which manifests the improvement of intimacy degrees. In contrast, individuals with egoistic preferences tend to reduce their willingness to interact after multiple interactions, which shows the reduction of intimacy degrees. Moreover, individuals with fair preferences fall somewhere in between. However, it can be seen from Figures 10 and 12 that the polarization percentage (i.e., the proportion of the number of individuals of |xi| > 0.9 to all individuals) in the network composed of individuals with fair preference is the highest, followed by altruistic preference, mixed preference, and egoistic preference in descending order. Besides, in order to further study the influences of different social preferences on the effects of public opinion polarization, the proportions of individuals with three different preferences were set to 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100% (the rest of the individuals are assumed to be without any preference).

Others were worried that more people would lie down later. Thus, we can see that there are heterogeneous individuals in the network whose preferences are different. However, these individuals with different preferences widely exist in the network, and they may have different views on the same thing, which has a significant influence on the network polarization phenomenon.",

Firstly, when the benefit of the interaction between individual i and j is always negative, then after several interactions, individual i will no longer be willing to interact with j. At this moment, the connection between individuals i and j is broken in the social network. Secondly, except for the individual j, individual i will also interact with other individuals in the network and obtain benefits from them. However, if the total gain obtained by individual i in interacting with these individuals is negative, then at the next moment, individual i will no longer be willing to participate in the interaction and express his/her own views. In the network, individual i is shown as i being completely disconnected from all nodes and becoming an isolated one, thus exiting the propagation process of the hot event. As a result, the different preferences of individuals can act on the network structure by influencing the benefits of individuals. Also, the network structure will also have an important impact on public opinion polarization, and the network with high aggregation will help increase the interaction frequency of individuals, thus affecting public opinion polarization.

This section compares connections at the initial moment and the moment after the emergence of public opinion polarization (time = 10). The results are shown in Figures 16-19 , where Figure 16 is the histogram of attitude distribution frequency in the network at the initial moment as well as time = 10, respectively, and Figure 17 shows the connections of network nodes at the two different moments. In order to better illustrate the specific meaning of Figure 17 , a diagram of connections among nodes (N = 20) is drawn and shown in Figure 18 . The network used in the experiment is the BA network; the network aggregation is 0.320, N = 500, and the remaining parameters are = 0.1, = 0.1, \u03b1 = 0.35, \u03b2 = 0.35, \u03b3 = 0.2. Each of the three preferences contributes 1/3 and they are mixed in the network. From Figure 16 , the attitude values of all individuals xi ~ U (\u22121,1) in the network at the initial moment are evenly distributed, while at time = 10, there is an obvious polarization, and the attitude values of most individuals are at the extremes of +1 and \u22121. Figure 17 shows the connections of network nodes at the initial time and time = 10. As shown in Figures 17 and 18 , three kinds of scatter points represent individuals with different preferences in the network: the grays catter points represent individuals with fair preference, the blue ones represent individuals with egoistic include five colors, i.e., green, yellow, orange, red, and purple. Since the attitude values are evenly distributed in the interval [\u22121,1] at the initial moment, the attitude distance between two individuals is relatively small, and |xi \u2212 xj| > 1.6 is less likely to occur. After the polarization phenomenon occurs, as shown in Figure 17b , the attitude values of all individuals in the network change significantly, and most individuals show green and purple lines, representing the two extremes of the attitude distances between adjacent individuals |xi \u2212 xj| < 0.4 or |xi \u2212 xj| > 2.0. In addition, Figure 19 shows the connections and distribution of three different preferences in the network after the occurrence of public opinion polarization phenomenon, in which the lines and scatter points are represented in the same way as shown in Figure 17 , that is, the scatter points of three different colors represent the individuals with different preferences, and the lines of different colors represent the different attitude distances among neighboring individuals. From the vertical comparisons in Figure 19 , we can see that the connections among individuals with fair preference and altruistic preference change little in the network, while the connections among individuals with egoistic preference almost completely break. The horizontal comparisons in Figure 19 show that individuals with different preferences are more likely to interact. Figure 19a ,d,g represents the interactions among individuals with the same preference, respectively. At this point, the attitude distance among individuals with the same preference almost only has two extreme values, |xi \u2212 xj| < 0.4 or |xi \u2212 xj| > 2.0. In contrast, the interactions among individuals with different preferences represented in Figure 19b ,e,h appear more connections of intermediate attitude distances, which illustrates that after the emergence of public opinion polarization, the existence of more differentiated individuals is easier to stabilize the network. Moreover, Figure 19c ,f,i shows the degree distribution of individuals with different preferences, in which the network degree distribution of egoistic individuals is significantly smaller than that of the other two preferences, while the difference between fair preference and altruistic preference is not obvious.",

From the vertical comparisons in Figure 19 , we can see that the connections among individuals with fair preference and altruistic preference change little in the network, while the connections among individuals with egoistic preference almost completely break. The horizontal comparisons in Figure 19 show that individuals with different preferences are more likely to interact. Figure 19a ,d,g represents the interactions among individuals with the same preference, respectively. At this point, the attitude distance among individuals with the same preference almost only has two extreme values, |x i \u2212 x j | < 0.4 or |x i \u2212 x j | > 2.0. In contrast, the interactions among individuals with different preferences represented in Figure 19b ,e,h appear more connections of intermediate attitude distances, which illustrates that after the emergence of public opinion polarization, the existence of more differentiated individuals is easier to stabilize the network. Moreover, Figure 19c ,f,i shows the degree distribution of individuals with different preferences, in which the network degree distribution of egoistic individuals is significantly smaller than that of the other two preferences, while the difference between fair preference and altruistic preference is not obvious.",

At the initial moment, after perceiving the information, individual viewpoint expression revenue U o will lead to generating a willingness to communicate, which drives the individual to keep interaction at the next moment. However, depending on the attitude distance among the interlocutors, U f will encourage each other due to the similarity of views, or argue with each other due to the repulsion of views, thus producing both positive and negative benefits to the interlocutors. Similarly, when calculating the mainstream income, U s , individuals will also generate negative revenue because they deviate from the mainstream view of the society. Therefore, if the revenue of each interaction is negative, the individual will tend to adjust his/her attitude to change the revenue he/she obtained, or he/she may lose interest in the event due to the negative revenue after adjusting his/her attitude, thus completely leaving the network. Hence, to analyze the public opinion polarization phenomenon, it is necessary to consider the change of individual profit in the network and the number of exit network nodes.",

These microblogs are widely focused, with more than 10,000 comments per microblog.Therefore, in order to accurately restore the public opinion development process of the \"Internet red beating pregnant women\" incident, we separated the comments under these three microblogs of \"headline news\" and analyze them. Through the emotional orientation [36] in the comments, we roughly divided the comments we have separated into three categories: those who support pregnant women, those who support the internet red, and those who maintain neutrality, as shown in Figure 25 : are widely focused, with more than 10,000 comments per microblog.Therefore, in order to accurately restore the public opinion development process of the \"Internet red beating pregnant women\" incident, we separated the comments under these three microblogs of \"headline news\" and analyze them.

The results are shown in Figure 26 . From Figure 26a , we can see that at the initial time, almost all individual attitudes are positive, that is, they support the pregnant woman's viewpoint, but with the evolution of public opinion, some individuals' attitudes begin to shift to neutrality. Finally, when time = 18, their attitudes change again, and most of the individual attitudes turn negative, that is, they support \"Saya\", which is roughly consistent with the trend shown in Figure 25 . At the same time, as shown in Figure 26b , we use the macro model proposed in [14] to simulate and get simulation results. Comparing these two figures, we can see that the evolutionary trends of these two are basically the same. Whereas, the model considering individual heterogeneity preference can polarize public opinion more quickly than the one proposed in [14] , the reason may be that, in such a typical case as \"Internet red beating pregnant women\", individuals have obvious preferences which make individuals with the same preference form similar viewpoints. For example, at the beginning of this incident, a very large percentage of people prefer to support the weak. After that, with the disclosure of information, most individuals hold fairness preference and supported Internet red. As the result, in the evolution of public opinion, the opinion polarization phenomenon can occur quickly, which is roughly consistent with the model proposed in this paper. However, the model proposed in [14] considers the dynamic conformity of individuals, which make individuals have a relatively low tendency to conform to the crowd. Therefore, more interactions are needed to eventually form opinion polarization.In fact, this paper focuses on the analysis of individual micro interactions. Through the model in this paper, we can accurately analyze the different performance of different preference individuals under the effect of heterogeneity revenue.",
