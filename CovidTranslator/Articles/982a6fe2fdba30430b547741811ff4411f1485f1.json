The predominant adult hemoglobin consists of a tetramer 43 containing two \u03b1-globin and two \u03b2-globin protein subunits, each of which binds a single heme molecule 44 signatures of positive selection. Because globin genes have been shown to undergo gene conversion 94 which can distort inferred phylogenetic relationships, all analyses were performed using both a well-95 supported species tree as well as gene trees generated using PhyML. All tests detected significant 96 evidence of positive selection acting on both \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin using both species and gene phylogenies 97 (Supplemental Data) . Multiple iterations repeatedly identified two sites in \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin exhibiting strong 98 signatures of positive selection ( Figure 1A) . It was immediately apparent that these rapidly-evolving sites 99 localized to similar regions of the \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin proteins, specifically the N-terminal A helix and the 100 hinge region between the E and F helices ( Figure 1B ). In fact, the two sites exhibiting signatures of 101 selection in the \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin A helices are at homologous positions. These parallel signatures of 102 selection between \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin could indicate that a similar selective pressure has driven this 103 divergence between primate species. To investigate whether bacterial heme scavenging receptors could 104 be one such pressure, rapidly evolving sites were mapped onto a recently solved co-crystal structure 105 between human hemoglobin and the IsdB protein from S. aureus. Notably, all four residues are localized 106 to the IsdB binding interface, in close proximity to the NEAT1 domain ( Figure 1C ). Together these findings 107 indicate that primate globins have undergone rapid divergence at specific sites proximal to the binding 108 interface with Gram-positive bacterial hemoglobin receptors. 109 110 111 All rights reserved.

S. aureus exhibited significantly reduced binding of baboon and marmoset 128 hemoglobin to the cell surface ( Figure 2A) .

Mechanistically, these 151 findings also suggest that both globins contribute to S. aureus species-specific hemoglobin capture.

These results demonstrate that the N-terminal 163 helix of \u03b1-globin makes a major contribution to S. aureus hemoglobin specificity. Next, the relative 164 importance of the rapidly evolving N78 residue in \u03b1-globin was assessed, which lies N-terminal to the 165 sixth alpha helix ( Figure 3B ). Substitution of N78 to glutamine (present in baboon, talapoin, and other Old 166 World primates) or to histidine, reduced binding of human hemoglobin ( Figure 3E ).

Therefore, the contribution of rapidly evolving residues in \u03b2-globin to this 183 binding interaction were investigated ( Figure 4A ). Both S9 and A76 interact closely with the NEAT1 184 domain of IsdB ( Figure 4B ). The effect of substituting human \u03b2-globin S9 and A76 with residues found in 185 other primate species analyzed in this work was systematically tested, which revealed that A76 is 186 particularly important for binding by S. aureus ( Figure 4C ). Notably, baboon hemoglobin displays 187 phylogenetic variation at both position 9 and 76, suggesting that these residues may contribute to the 188 inability of IsdB to bind baboon hemoglobin. This variance might also explain the binding affinity 189 differences between human hemoglobin and the \u03b1-human \u03b2-baboon chimera, observed in Figure 3A . As 190 for \u03b1-globin, no single residue substitution improved binding by S. aureus IsdB, consistent with the idea 191 that IsdB has specifically adapted to bind human hemoglobin. Taken together with earlier data, residues 192 at the IsdB interface of both \u03b1-globin and \u03b2-globin contribute to recognition of hemoglobin by S. aureus. 193 This is consistent with the NEAT1 domain of multiple IsdB monomers engaging in hemoglobin capture 194 by binding both \u03b1-and \u03b2-globins, as observed in the co-crystal structure (22). 195 All rights reserved.

The IsdB NEAT1 subdomain 206 Q162R-S170T is critical for hemoglobin recognition and is completely conserved among more than three 207 thousand S. aureus clinical isolates (11). Therefore, IsdB variation among congeneric S. argenteus and 208 S. schweitzeri was assessed. These recently diverged taxa ( Figure 5A ) are both primate-associated and, 209 unlike most other staphylococci, encode IsdB. We measured the ability of IsdB from S. argenteus and S. 210 schweitzeri to bind hemoglobin by expressing them ectopically in S. aureus. Consistent with their overall 211 high sequence identity, S. schweitzeri and S. argenteus IsdB bind primate hemoglobin with a similar 212 pattern of species preference as S. aureus ( Figure 5B ). However, both the IsdB of S. schweitzeri and S. 213 argenteus display reduced binding of talapoin hemoglobin, and S. argenteus IsdB does not bind 214 marmoset significantly worse than human. These data indicate that variation among IsdB impacts 215 species-specific hemoglobin capture. 216 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

In particular, rapidly evolving sites in the \u03b1-and \u03b2-globin A-271 helices are predicted to be homologous based on predicted protein alignments. Our results suggest that 272 these correlations reflect selection in response to NEAT domain-containing bacterial receptors like IsdB 273 with conserved globin binding sites. A well-established body of literature has shown that other selective 274 pressures play an important role in patterns of hemoglobin polymorphism and divergence across 275 vertebrates, including adaptation to high altitude and malaria resistance (34, 38). It is therefore possible 276 that signatures of selection detected in our study have been driven by pressures other than nutritional 277 immunity. Nonetheless, our empirical results demonstrate that variation in hemoglobins at discrete sites 278 has important functional consequences for bacterial iron acquisition. 279",

Primate hemoglobin variation dictates S. aureus binding and heme-iron acquisition. (A) 138 S. aureus binds hemoglobin with species specificity. Iron-starved S. aureus was incubated with 10 \u00b5g/ml 139 purified recombinant hemoglobin from representative species. Hemoglobin bound to the surface of S. 140 aureus was eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE; relative hemoglobin abundance was measured by 141 densitometry analysis (Image J) and compared to human hemoglobin for each replicate. (B) IsdB 142 preference of hemoglobin binding correlates with the ability of S. aureus to utilize hemoglobin as the sole 143 iron source.

(B) The Q162-S170 subdomain of NEAT1 (cyan) is proximal to helices containing T8 and N78 239 of \u03b1-globin (red).

Estimations of divergence 248 in the Staphylococcus genus have been lacking, however the Kloos hypothesis (39) contends that 249 staphylococci have coevolved with their mammalian hosts over long evolutionary timescales. In support 250 of this concept, primate-specificity among staphylococci has been reported including S. aureus, S. 251 epidermidis, and S. warneri, as well as avian (S. gallinarum), equine (S. equorum), and others.
