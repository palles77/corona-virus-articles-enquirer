This paper presents an empirical spatio-temporal analysis of epidemiological data concerning 2321 SARS-infected patients in Beijing in 2003. We mapped the SARS morbidity data with the spatial data resolution at the level of street and township. Two smoothing methods, Bayesian adjustment and spatial smoothing, were applied to identify the spatial risks and spatial transmission trends. Furthermore, we explored various spatial patterns and spatio-temporal evolution of Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic using spatial statistics such as Moran's I and LISA. Part of this study is targeted at evaluating the effectiveness of public health control measures implemented during the SARS epidemic. The main findings are as follows. (1) The diffusion speed of SARS in the northwest-southeast direction is weaker than that in northeast-southwest direction.",

(3) Two spatial clusters of disease cases are identified: one in the city center and the other in the eastern suburban area. These two clusters followed different evolutionary paths but interacted with each other as well. (4) Although the government missed the opportunity to contain the early outbreak of SARS in March 2003, the response strategies implemented after the mid of April were effective. These response measures not only controlled the growth of the disease cases, but also mitigated the spatial diffusion.",

Many natural and social-economic factors contributed to and in-fluenced SARS transmissions.

SARS infection cases in Beijing accounted for about 30% of the total number of global infections. With an effective treatment or vaccine absent, public health response measures were restricted to case management (e.g., isolating known cases and quarantining close contacts of the patients) and proactive monitoring of identified high-risk groups. As such, from a practical standpoint, it is critical to reveal the spatio-temporal evolutionary patterns of the epidemic and have the capability to quantitatively evaluating the impact of response and control measures taken. Beijing, a major global center of political, economic, and educational and research activities, with a population close to seventeen million, is vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks such as SARS and influenza A. Our study focuses on 2003 SARS epidemic in Beijing because of both data availability as well as its impact, importance, and representativeness.",

However, based on our literature review, only a handful of studies have touched upon spatio-temporal data analysis, mostly with aggregated data. Wang explored the multidimensional spatial distribution, spatial cluster and spatial correlation based on tens of thousands of close contact incidences [21] [22] [23] [24] . Liu et al. [25] distinguished the spatial patterns of the Beijing SARS epidemic between urban and suburban areas. These studies have resulted in many interesting findings. However, the central questions concerning SARS spreading patterns and evaluation of government control measures remain largely unexplored. (1) Close contact incidences cannot substitute for SARS transmission incidences for analysis purposes as the exposure between an infective individual and a susceptible individual needs to be examined through confirmed infection cases. (2) It is crucial to perform spatio-temporal analysis using fine-granularity resolutions such as streets and townships. (3) The existing work has focused on either temporal or spatial analysis, whereas an integrated understanding through space and time is critically needed. (4) The existing work does not support evaluation of public health response and control measures in terms of spatio-temporal evolution of disease cases and disease transmission mechanisms.",

As such, we need to convert them to spatio-temporal data of GIS format. To analyze the spatial patterns and understand the complexity of spatial transmission risks, we have adopted home addresses as spatial locations of cases as homes have been widely recognized as one of the highest risk places for SARS transmission. Another reason to choose home address is that it is the most complete data what spatial information we can obtain from the survey data. Figure 2 (a) maps the spatial locations of 2321 SARS cases studied. The remaining 123 SARS cases were abandoned because of incomplete, wrong or unavailable spatial information. It is easy to see that most SARS patients aggregated in the urban area. Table 1 summarizes the rules for spatial location processing. According to these rules, we obtained 2321 available spatial points (out of 2444 cases), where each point corresponds to a SARS case. From Figure 2 (a), we see that only a small number of SARS patients lived in outskirts, which represents a potential source of uncertainty to spatio-temporal analysis. Thus for our analysis we focused on these cases located in the urban areas ( Figure 2 (b)), which covers all regions within 5th Ring Road and includes 2227 cases, accounting for 91.10% of the total number of all reported SARS cases during Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic.",

The area of the smallest spatial unit is about 1.03 km 2 and the largest 163.00 km 2 . The number of SARS cases within each unit was obtained by the standard GIS overlay analysis. Overlay analysis combines information from the point layer of SARS cases with the polygon layer of the underlying spatial statistical units to determine whether a given case point belongs to a certain spatial unit. The population data for each unit come from a 1% population sample survey conducted in 2005. The morbidity map shows intuitively that the risks of SARS infection in areas close to the city center are higher than those in the city's peripheral areas. Also, there might be some relationship between the morbidity rate and these circle roads.",

As pointed out earlier, in Figure 4 (a), we observe that the units with greater population density are associated with rates that are not only closer to the average morbidity, but also with smaller variation. As the size of population decreases, the fluctuation in the raw morbidity rates increases. We also found that the SARS morbidity rates in some units were zeros, which is clearly not a true representation of the potential risk to SARS disease transmission. The Bayesian adjustment technique has been widely applied to solve these problems. Under the Bayesian framework, it is assumed that the rates in neighboring spatial units are correlated, and for the units with low population density, the rates from their neighbors can be used to help establish a more realistic rate. Figure 3 (b) shows the morbidity map after Bayesian adjustments. The Bayesian-adjusted morbidity rates as a function of the raw morbidity rates are plotted in Figure 4 (b). An obvious change is that the morbidity rates in the city's peripheral areas with no known SARS cases have been increased. Abnormally high morbidity rates in certain areas have declined. There is little adjustment of the morbidity rates in center areas with high population density. The Bayesian adjustment procedural as applied to SARS morbidity rates is outlined below [26] .",

As shown in Figure 3 (a), noises in the raw data have resulted in over-mixing of dark areas (indicative of high risks) and light areas (with low risks), making the task of identifying the overall disease transmission trends hard. Spatial smoothing is a statistical method to solve this problem. The purpose of spatial smoothing is to cope with functional variability that cannot be compensated by spatial normalization and to improve the signal to noise ratio. In other words, smoothing aims to increase statistical power. At the same time, smoothing can lead to reduced sensitivity and loss of spatial details, especially when using a large moving window. Procedurally, spatial smoothing involves computing the rate in a moving window centered on each spatial unit in turn. The moving window includes the units as well as its neighbors. With respect to the signal to noise ratio, an ideal moving window will be determined based on the specific requirement of the analysis tasks at hand and the target spatial patterns expected to be detected. A moving window determines the neighbors. A traditional way to represent neighborhood relationships is through a n\u00d7n spatial weight matrix W: 11 12 1",

Spatial dependency also directly leads to the spatial auto-correlation problem since it violates standard statistical independence assumptions.

As such, we adopt spatially smoothed morbidity rates to explore spatial variation pattern of the Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic.

This assumption means that the expected z value is an unknown constant and the variance of the difference is the same between any two points that are at the same dis-tance and direction. As there is a clear directional spatial trend in the morbidity map as shown in Figure 3 , this assumption is violated. In our study, we applied a global second-order surface to remove this spatial trend. We have focused on residuals to explore the spatial variation features by the semi-variogram method. Figure 5 shows the spatial variation of the Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic based on spatially smoothed morbidity rates. The related estimated parameters are summarized in Table 2 . Geometric anisotropy, with the semi-variogram reaching the same sill in all directions, but at different ranges, was employed for anisotropy. The longest range, 13.627 km, occurs in northeast-southwest direction, whereas the shortest range, 8.545 km, occurs in northwest-southeast direction. The ratio of the longest range dividing the shortest one is 13.627/8.545\u22481.6, indicating that the spatial risk of SARS transmission is anisotropic. The greater the spatial variability, the slower the speed of spatial diffusion.

There are four categories of spatial patterns in a LISA map. The high-high and low-low locations (positive local spatial autocorrelation) are typically referred to as spatial clusters, while the high-low and low-high locations (negative local spatial autocorrelation) are termed spatial outliers. A cluster is computed as such when the value at a location (either high or low) is more similar to its neighbors than would be the case under spatial randomness. The high-high locations refers to hot spot areas where the risk of SARS spreading is higher than average where as the low-low locations refers to cool spot areas where the risk of SARS spread is lower than average. From Figure 7 (a), we observe that the high-high locations aggregated in urban areas, covering the northern areas within the 3rd ring road, and the eastern peripheral areas near the Tongzhou district. The low-low locations concen-trated in northwest peripheral areas. More specifically, (1) there is a cluster of high-risk areas in the city center, which may be the result of high population density and aggregated hospitals in those areas. (2) The Tongzhou district, located in the far east end of Beijing with low population density and few hospitals receiving SARS patients, also appears to possess high risk. A partial explanation could be economicsocial: the cost of living in the Central Business District (CBD) located in the Chaoyang district is expensive, thus many people working in the CBD choose to live in the Tongzhou district, a much affordable area. Also the Beijing-Shenyang Expressway provides a convenient travel for these people. (3) People living in the northwest peripheral areas were better protected, which may be the result of more effective control measures or low intensity and frequency of contacts and interactions among the population in these places. (4) Public health response and control measures against the SARS epidemic seem to be quite effective as the high risk areas of the SARS transmission were confined to a limited area without city-wide outbreaks.",

In public health practice, when an epidemic outbreak occurs, especially for new and emerging diseases, very often action needs to be taken based on sparse knowledge about the pathogen and disease transmission. The public health response mechanisms such as quarantine are often implemented without a proper understanding of their impact. Some measures were complentmented blindly, which resulted in some serious problems, such as high economic and social price. Nowadays, although a large number of researchers have made tremendous progress, but there remains a long distance to reach successes. SARS has pandemic potential, but an effective public health response can curtail this threat. Using the Beijing 2003 SARS epidemic data, this study demonstrates the impor-tance of analyzing spatial patterns and spatio-temporal evolutionary patterns in the context of infectious disease informatics. Our empirical findings provide useful insights that could help better understand disease transmission mechanisms and prepare for and respond to possible reemergence of the SARS epidemic or other novel epidemics of acute infectious diseases. Over the past two decades, with the development of information technology and its extensive application, mass spatio-temporal data storage, management and dynamic update are no longer a problem. Furthermore, spatial statistical methods have been developed rapidly, which have been used widely in a lot of fields, such as resources, environment, ecology, economic and sociality. Spatial statistical methods have been proved a powerful tool to public health. A new discipline, spatial epidemiology, has formed based on the intersection of epidemiology, spatial statistics and geographic information systems, which is the study of the spatial distribution of disease. At present, researching on spatial epidemiology in China is still in its early stage; this paper can promote its development in public health field and provide a sample of using spatial statistical methods to study the infectious disease epidemics, such as avian flu, hand-foot-mouth disease and Influenza A (H1N1).",

WHO issued a warning to China; the then Minister of Health held a press conference announcing that the SARS transmission was under control Risk of SARS transmission increased quickly. SARS began to spread in the peripheral areas and formed high-risk clusters. However, the spatial diffusion to the northwest suburbs was stopped. National mobilization of all resources against SARS outbreak; information relate to SARS made open to the general public; SARS hospitals were established with serious infections isolated; travel was subject to control Major outbreak occurred. Control measures and epidemic information were made accessible to the public. The situation began to improve with lowered case growing speed and no further spatial diffusion. Xiaotangshan hospital was set up quickly to treat all known SARS cases; government continued to restrict and control people's travels and activities Control measures began to work and the epidemic was prevented effectively.
