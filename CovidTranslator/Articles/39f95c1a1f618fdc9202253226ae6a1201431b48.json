            "text": "About one month after the COVID-19 epidemic peaked in Mainland China and SARS-CoV-2 migrated to Europe and then the U.S., the epidemiological data begin to provide important insights into the risks associated with the disease and the effectiveness of intervention strategies such as travel restrictions and social distancing. Respiratory diseases, including the 2003 SARS epidemic, remain only about two months in any given population, although peak incidence and lethality can vary. The epidemiological data suggest that at least two strains of the 2020 SARS-CoV-2 virus have evolved during its migration from Mainland China to Europe. South Korea, Iran, Italy, and Italy's neighbors were hit by the more dangerous \"SKII\" variant. While the epidemic in continental Asia is about to end, and in Europe about to level off, the more recent epidemic in the younger US population is still increasing, albeit not exponentially anymore. The peak level will likely depend on which of the strains has entered the U.S. first. The same models that help us to understand the epidemic also help us to choose prevention strategies. Containment of high-risk people, like the elderly, and reducing disease severity, either by vaccination or by early treatment of complications, is the best strategy against a respiratory virus disease. Social distancing or \"lockdowns\" can be effective during the month following the peak incidence in infections, when the exponential increase of cases ends. Earlier containment of low-risk people merely prolongs the time the virus needs to circulate until the incidence is high enough to initiate \"herd immunity\". Later containment is not helpful, unless to prevent a rebound if containment started too early.",

(Malik 2020) After three months, enough data are available to discuss important epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and the potential impact of interventions. In particular, we have now seen the number of new cases (and deaths) to decline in China and South Korea and to at least stabilize in some European countries. Changes in number of deaths follow the changes in number cases (albeit at a lower level) by about two weeks. Hence, we can discuss both the infectiousness and the lethality of the virus, two important characteristics to assess public health impact of the disease.",

While Italy has many people 65 years and older (23%, second only to Japan data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS ), the relatively small differences or age distribution within Europe (e.g., Germany: 21%) are unlikely to account for much of this difference.

The incidence is still low (currently at about 55/M/d) and is likely to continue to increase until early April. If incidence in the U.S. were to peak at about 75/M/d, as in Europe as a whole (Fig 4b) , one would expect new cases to peak at up to 25,000 per day and the cumulative incidence could reach 600/M (3 times the number of cases per million people in South Korea to account for a longer course because of the size of the countries) or a total of 200,000 cases, and, at 2% lethality, about 4,000 deaths, about four times the currently reported cumulative number of 1,079. These are conservative estimates, because only 1% of cases died in South Korea over the course of the epidemic and both countries have a similar proportion of people older than 65 years (14% vs 16%) On the other hand, the numbers could double if the SKII strain should have hit the US earlier. A number of 4000-8000 U.S. death over the course of the epidemic compares to an expected number of 16,000-78,000 influenza deaths per season from pneumonia and respiratory/circulatory complications alone, which also occur predominantly among people at 65 years of age and older.

For instance, during much of the HIV epidemic, there was widespread fear that HIV could establish itself in the population as a whole, even though the data (including data showing absence of transmission to the wives of hemophiliacs) (Wittkowski 1995a) and models (Wittkowski 1992; Seydel 1994) contradicted this fear. (Wittkowski 1995b; 1996) These results have been repeatedly confirmed. (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019; Haddad 2019) In the case of heterosexual transmission of HIV one could argue that there was little risk associated with a the public health policy promoting condom use, but in the case of COVID-19 prevention, ignoring models and data may carry substantial risk.",

Hence, one would expect the cases to appear in waves (Fig 12, the period of the \"lockdown\" corresponds to March to May, 2020 in the U.S.). Such waves of cases have been seen in different countries and the longer than expected duration of the epidemic supports the hypothesis that the social distancing / lockdown interventions had some effect, albeit at a high cost for approx. 10% of deaths saved. This analysis of the publicly available data suggests that at the time Italy imposed quarantine on the Lombardy and adjacent regions on 03-08, the SKII virus strain had already reached the adjacent countries (Switzerland, France, Spain, Austria, Slovenia).

Hence, the optimal time point for starting a New York public health intervention to reduce duration and impact of the COVID-19 epidemic was around 03-27. Social segregation against COVID-19 in NY, as one of the epicenters of the U.S. epidemic, started about 03-17 (day 73) with restaurants being closed, and intensified on 03-22 (day 78) with all non-essential businesses being closed.
