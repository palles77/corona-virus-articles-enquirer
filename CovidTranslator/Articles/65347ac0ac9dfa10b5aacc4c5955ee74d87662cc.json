The retinal pigment epithelial (RPE), a unique retinal cell, displays a number of essential functions to support the health of the retina. In this review, we highlight how the RPE cell plays a pivotal role in immune defense. The RPE cell orchestrates both innate and adaptive immunity since it expresses TLRs, complement components, MHC class I and II molecules, and serves as an antigen presenting cell. Moreover, both of these immune responses result in the production of a plethora of cytokines, mainly proinflammatory. In order to counteract these inflammatory factors and silence unwanted immune reactivity, the RPE cell also generates suppressive molecules. Recently, chronic immune reactivity has been implicated in a number of retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Current evidence suggests that the generation of excessive retinal inflammation may be the consequence of a loss of RPE immunosuppressive factors. Herein, we summarize the varied interactions of the RPE cell with the immune response and highlight how the RPE cell survives and participates in this dynamic environment.",

            "text": "The retinal pigment epithelium consists of a single layer of cells of neural ectoderm origin which lie between the photoreceptors of the neural retina and the blood-rich choroid. Along with the photoreceptor layer, the RPE is an indispensable component of the visual process. Physiologically, the RPE cell displays a number of essential functions to support the neural retina. These vitally important cells phagocytize the shed discs from the photoreceptor outer segments, transport nutrients from the choroid into the retina and transport waste in the reverse direction. This cell also absorbs light and provides adhesive properties for the retina [3] . Immunologically, the RPE cell plays a pivotal role in immune responses. The RPE cell expresses Toll-like receptors, complement components, Fc-gamma receptors, responds to IFN-c treatment and up-regulates the expression of both MHC Class I and II molecules, and serves as a resident APC in the retina [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . In addition, this cell is a rich source of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors that may contribute to or limit a variety of pathologic processes [9] [10] [11] [12] . Finally, the RPE cell serves as a primary site for retinal damage or alterations that may have important consequences resulting in ocular pathology. For example, inherited retinal degenerative diseases can be associated with mutations of RPE cellular genes [13, 14] . Also, AMD and diabetic retinopathy can be associated with early damage and atrophy of the RPE cell [15, 16] . In addition, numerous in vivo and in vitro studies have identified this cell as an ideal target for infectious agents, such as cytomegalovirus in CMV retinitis, Toxoplasma gondii in ocular Toxoplasmosis, and more recently, coronavirus in experimental coronavirus retinopathy [9, [17] [18] [19] [20] . Despite the upsurge of interest in the RPE cell and its critically important role in retinal health and disease, the exact mechanisms of how the RPE cell participates in regulation remain largely unclear.",

            "text": "Toll-like receptors, TLRs, are a family of evolutionary conserved innate immune recognition molecules that sense molecular patterns associated with microbial pathogens. TLR recognition of these specific microbial patterns leads to a signal transduction cascade that generates a rapid and robust inflammatory response marked by cellular activation and the production of a variety of cytokines, including proinflammatory cytokines, cytokines that promote T cell differentiation, type 1 interferons, and chemokines. The TLR molecules, which serve as the first line of defense, are now thought to be present on numerous cell types within the body [21] . Just recently, these sentinel molecules were described on the RPE cell. It is not surprising that the RPE cell is endowed with many of the TLRs, since it is strategically situated and can provide a rapid defense system for the retina [22] . Using real time PCR analysis of TLR gene expression, we described the presence of TLR1 through 7, 9, and 10 on human RPE cells. Interestingly, TLR3, an important TLR for defense against virus infection, is highly expressed on these cells. TLR3 recognizes a dsRNA motif, an intermediate product of virus replication or Poly I:C, an analog of dsRNA. When we analyzed signaling through TLR3, it was discovered that the RPE cells secreted several proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, including, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, and sICAM-1. One of the cytokines that was highly expressed by RPE cells was IFN-b. It is well known that the IFNs are involved in numerous immune interactions and induction of type 1 IFN gene expression is an essential component of innate immunity [21] . Additionally, IFN-b is a potent anti-viral cytokine as well as an immunoregulatory and anti-proliferative cytokine [23] . Nevertheless, its role in the retina had not yet been described. Additional kinetic studies revealed that IFN-b levels continued to increase over a 48-h period and this continuous IFN-b production by RPE cells was associated with the up-regulation of IRF7 gene expression, a known positive feedback molecule for IFN-b production [24] . Since IFN-b is a potent immunosuppressive cytokine that is effective in treating patients with MS, we have continued to explore this property of IFN-b in the retina. These findings enhance the cytokine repertoire of RPE cells and underscore that this cell produces not only inflammatory cytokines important for immune responses but also immunosuppressive cytokines that serve to down-regulate immune reactivity within the posterior segment, a vital mechanism for protecting retinal tissue from excessive or unwanted damage.",

Our laboratories provided the initial description of how the RPE cell functions as an APC [4] [5] [6] 28] . First, we noted that when retinal tissue from patients with uveitis, RP, or sympathetic ophthalmia were evaluated, the RPE cell expressed MHC class I and II molecules and the infiltrating T cells contained IL-2 and IFN-c. Next, our early in vitro studies demonstrated that IFN-c treatment up-regulated both class I and class II molecules on RPE cells and hence equipped this cell to participate as a resident APC in the retina. Both retinal and non-retinal (BCG) antigens can be processed and presented by the RPE cell [5] . These findings were an essential first step leading to further investigations underscoring the important role of the RPE cell in inflammatory, infectious, and degenerative processes. In order to further elucidate fundamental mechanisms of disease progression, we choose an animal model. Experimental autoimmune uveitis, EAU, is a T cell-mediated disease that mimics human uveitis. Using this model system, we showed that anti-MHC class II antibody treatment delayed the onset of EAU and diminished the severity of disease [29] . Furthermore, this treatment down-regulated expression of MHC class II molecules on RPE cells and limited infiltration of inflammatory cells into the retina. Over the years, EAU has continued to serve as an excellent model in which to delineate the various components of retinal inflammation and to explore addition therapies that may modify this disease process.",

Over 60 years ago, Sir Peter Medawar, the Nobel laureate and pioneer of transplantation immunology, identified the concept of immune privilege in the brain, the eye, and the pregnant uterus [30] . In the anterior chamber of the eye, he eloquently demonstrated that transplanted skin allografts survived without being rejected. He attributed the survival to immunologic ignorance. Today, we recognize that ocular immune privilege extends to the retina as well and is operational due to an extensive array of regulatory mechanisms acting in concert to prevent immunologic inflammation and maintain tissue integrity. Some of these mechanisms include, the unique anatomic features of the blood-retinal barrier, a lack of lymphatic drainage pathways, immunomodulatory cytokines, and regulatory T cells. This section will identify how the RPE cell survives and participates in this dynamic environment.",

For example, the RPE cell participates by releasing a variety of suppressive factors, including TGF-b, IL-11, and IFN-b, and hence, the immune response can be silenced.

Moreover, TGF-b is associated with retinal disorders such as retinal detachments, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and choroidal neovascularization. We have investigated the nature and mechanism of TGF-b production by human RPE cells. These studies have revealed that the RPE cell is a major source of TGF-b in the retina and TGF-b itself can activate RPE cells to produce VEGF, PDGF, and heme oxygenase [10, 11, 32] .",

On day 4, retinal gene expression and serum protein expression revealed the presence of IL-6, IFN-c, and TNF-a. The presence of retinal mRNA for IFN-c was also associated with the up-regulation of MHC Class I and II molecules within the RPE cell. Interestingly, the RPE cell is also the first cell to express new viral antigens during the infection in vivo and is persistently infected in vitro [47] .",

We therefore evaluated the possible role of host genetics in ECOR and noted that different strains of mice behave differently after virus infection. Two strains of mice, BABL/c and CD-1, were extensively studied after coronavirus infection. During the early phase of the disease (day 1-8), the virus infects and replicates within the retina of both BALB/c and CD-1 mouse stains [48] . However, on days 10-140, only the BALB/c mice experience a late phase of the disease which is marked by a retinal degeneration. The CD-1 mouse does not undergo the retinal degenerative phase, but rather, the retina reverts to a normal architecture within 20 days.",

These studies identified a distinct difference in the early innate immune response between the two mouse strains [12] . These differences are noted in the production of IFN-c, and the two chemokines triggered by IFN-c, CXCL9, and CXCL10. At day 2 and 3 PI, BALB/c mice have high levels of IFN-c, CXCL9, and CXCL10 in their sera. At the same time, significantly lower levels of these molecules are detected in sera from CD-1 mice. Moreover, real-time PCR analysis of retinas identified that CXCL9 and CXCL10 gene expression is significantly greater in retinas from BABL/c mice in comparison with CD-1 mice. CXCL9 and CXCL10 interact with CXCR3 present on activated T cells and NK cells, and they direct the migration of these cells to specific targets, such as the retina [12] . These studies are truly exciting and identify possible mechanisms that allow the BALB/c mouse to have a robust immune response that could trigger an autoimmune component.",

Inasmuch as viruses are know to trigger an autoimmune phenomena and some human retinopathies may be associated with autoantibody formation, we studied the possible production of antiretinal autoantibodies [18] . We found that the retinal degenerative process in BALB/c mice was associated with the presence of antiretinal autoantibodies that were directed against the neural retina and the RPE. These autoantibodies were not found in sera from normal or mock-injected mice. Likewise, none of the CD-1 mice developed antiretinal autoantibodies. Thus, the mice that failed to develop antiretinal autoantibodies also failed to develop a retinal degeneration. These findings suggest a role for autoimmunity in the pathogenesis of ECOR.",

Thus, a better understanding of the immunoregulatory actions of IL-11 and IFN-b may provide insight into novel therapeutic modalities and interventive strategies.
