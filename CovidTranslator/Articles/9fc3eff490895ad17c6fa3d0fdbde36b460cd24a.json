These antibodies may neutralize the biological effects of the protein drug, potentially decreasing its therapeutic effects. By high-resolution HLA class I and II typing we identified two HLA class II alleles associated with the development of antibodies to IFN-b. In two independent continuous and binary-trait association studies, HLA-DRB1*0401 and HLA-DRB1*0408 (odds ratio: 5.15)-but not other HLA alleles-were strongly associated with the development of binding and neutralizing antibodies to IFN-b. The associated HLA-DRB1*04 alleles differ from nonassociated HLA-DRB1*04 alleles by a glycine-to-valine substitution in position 86 of the epitope-binding alpha-helix of the HLA class II molecule. The peptide-binding motif of HLA-DRB1*0401 and *0408 might promote binding and presentation of an immunogenic peptide, which may eventually break Tcell tolerance and facilitate antibody development to IFN-b. In summary, we identified genetic factors determining the immunogenicity of IFN-b, a protein-based disease-modifying agent for the treatment of MS.",

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS [MIM 126200]) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system. Whereas the etiology of MS is likely to be heterogeneous, the influence of genetic factors in the development of MS has been confirmed by association and linkage studies. [1] [2] [3] [4] The crucial role of HLA alleles in the susceptibility to MS is well established. Whereas HLA-DRB1*15 alleles are strongly associated with MS in Europeans, DRB1*0301 and DRB1*0401 are overrepresented in MS patients from southern Europe. 5, 6 Overrepresentation of DRB1*04 alleles was reported for patients from Turkey and the Canary Islands. Although the genetic association of susceptibility to MS with loci outside the HLA complex has been confirmed in some cases, the search for susceptibility genes continues. 4 Interferon-b is the most widely used immunomodulatory drug for MS therapy. It is approved for treatment of clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. Furthermore, it has antiviral activity and remains an option in the therapy of diseases such as Hepatitis-C (HCV [MIM 609532]) or the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). [7] [8] [9] Like other protein-based disease-modifying agents, IFN-b exhibits immunogenicity. 10 Even though the technical improvement of purification processes and the introduction of recombinant preparations have helped to reduce the immunogenicity of IFN-b, up to 50% of patients may develop antibodies to IFN-b (binding antibodies [BABs] ), of which a significant proportion neutralize the activity of IFN-b (neutralizing antibodies [NABs] ) in vitro and vivo. 11 Currently, three distinct recombinant preparations of IFN-b are in use for the treatment of MS. Interferon b-1b (165 residues) is modified from naturally occurring IFN-b by deletion of the leading methionine and a single amino acid substitution (C17S). 12 It is recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (IFN-b-1b; Betaferon or Betaseron). IFN-b-1a, recombinantly expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, is identical to natural human interferon beta (166 residues) (IFN-b-1a; Avonex, Rebif). Although preparation and administration influence the immunogenic properties and the rate of antibody development, little is known about host factors that determine immune responses to IFN-b. 13 Antibody production and generation of B cell responses to proteins depend on the help of antigen-specific CD4 \u00fe T cells. 14 The development of antigen-specific CD4 \u00fe T cell responses itself is strongly influenced by the individual repertoire of HLA class II molecules, which present peptide antigens for recognition to the T cell receptor. 15, 16 Given the central role of CD4 \u00fe T cells for the development of antigen-specific B cell responses, we performed high-resolution typing for HLA-A, -B, -C, -DRB1, and -DQB1 alleles in MS patients receiving long-term IFN-b therapy.",

A total of 34 patients received IFN-b1a intramuscular injection (i.m.) once weekly (Avonex), 118 patients IFN-b1b subcutaneous injection (s.c.) every second day (Betaferon), 26 patients 22 mg and 90 patients 44 mg IFN-b1a s.c. three times a week (Rebif). The validation group compassed 242 patients with a male-female ratio of 0.36. Avonex treatment was administered to 68 patients, and Rebif was given to 88 individuals and 86 patients received Betaferon. As expected, IFN-b1a i.m. (Avonex)-treated patients were underrepresented in the study as a result of the lower frequency of antibody development in this group compared to patients treated with the formulations for s.c. application. Mean age was 39.8 yr in the first and 39.0 yr in the second group (Table 1) . Average treatment duration was 57 months in the first and 52 months in the second group.

This bilateral approach was used for the initial study group as well as for the validation group. For identification of genetic variation of anti-IFN-b formation, the continuous normalized antibody reactivities were directly compared among carriers of different alleles. In the binary-trait case-control study, patients were considered antibody positive (cases) if the anti-IFN-b levels exceeded the 25% cutoff value. Otherwise, patients were considered antibody negative (controls). Additionally, antibody-positive patients were considered NABs positive if their MX1 mRNAs were reduced below 50% of MX1 levels of newly treated patients. The remaining antibody-positive patients who had not significantly reduced MX1 mRNA levels were considered BABs positive. For the testing of differences of location parameters for MX1 gene expression and anti-IFN-b levels, the two-sided nonparametric Wilcoxon test was applied. p values were adjusted for multiple testing with the false-discovery rate (FDR). For identification of haplotype-specific associations with continuous (MX1 and anti-IFN-b levels) and binomial trait types (NABS, BABs, and control subgroups), the genetic analysis package (gap) of the R Project for statistical computing was applied with score tests for association as described by 20, 21 .

            "text": "As of December, 2006, 65 new biopharmaceuticals had been approved in the U.S., European Union, and Japan since 1999. Like IFN-b, 47 of these new biopharmaceuticals are derived from recombinant DNA technology. 22 Applications range from the treatment of more prevalent rheumatic diseases (Ethanercept) to rare acquired or inherited disease with protein deficiencies (Galsulfase). It is predicted that many more therapeutic proteins will become available in the near future for an even wider range of indications. 10 Despite their therapeutic potential, immunogenicity is a common problem to most, if not all, protein-based biopharmaceuticals and an important aspect of their safety. Antibodies might not only lead to the loss of drug efficacy but may also induce severe allergic reactions or neutralize the activity of endogenously produced protein. 23 It has been argued that in the absence of resilient predictors of immunogenicity, patients might be put at a high risk. 24 Preparation, handling, packaging, dose, frequency, and route of administration and treatment duration seem to affect immunogenicity of biopharmaceuticals. [25] [26] [27] However, the role of genetic factors in immunogenicity to protein-based therapeutics has not been addressed. In the present study we show that-besides the influence of different preparations on immunogenicity-genetic factors play an important role in the development of antibodies against protein therapeutics. Patients who carry the HLA-DRB1*0401 or HLA-DRB1*0408 allele show a 5-and 14-fold increased risk to develop antibodies to IFN-b, respectively. This results in an average relative risk of 2.07 for DRB*0401-and DRB*0408-positive patients. Although the HLA-DRB1*0401 or HLA-DRB1*0408 alleles increase the risk of developing antibodies in response to all IFN-b formulations, it remains to be determined, in further studies and with a different study design, whether formulations with higher immunogenicity are more affected by the HLA haplotype than those with low immunogenicity. These results are in line with the central role of T cells in eliciting B cell responses to protein targets: It seems that the peptide-binding motif of both alleles allows processing and binding of an IFN-b peptide that breaks tolerance by promoting a strong T helper cell response to the IFN-b protein. This breakdown of tolerance promotes a B cell response that eventually leads to the development of an antibody production against the IFN-b protein. It is striking that this effect critically depends on a single amino acid in the HLA-DRB1*04 allele sequence. The 86 G/V substitution in HLA-DRB1*04 alleles is likely to interfere with elevated immunogenicity either by altering the binding affinity of the IFN-b peptide because of secondary structure changes of the epitope-binding alpha helix or by affecting the presentation of the IFN-b peptide itself. It seems that these two alleles influence the general likelihood of developing an antibody response independent of the IFN-b preparation. Although antibody development was strongly affected by the alleles, the neutralizing activity of the antibodies was not significantly influenced by these HLA alleles. This suggests that both HLA-DRB1*04 alleles increase the likelihood of breaking tolerance to the protein by antibody production. Other factors, however, might determine whether the antibodies will neutralize IFN-b. One of those factors could be the intensity of an immune response to IFN-b. However, the rejection of the alternative hypothesis that the development of neutralizing antibodies is determined by HLA-DRB1*04 alleles might be due to insufficient test power and remains to be clarified in further studies.",

            "text": "Interestingly, HLA-DRB1*0401 has been associated with the development of autoantibodies against insulin. Congia et al. identified an immunodominant epitope in DRB1*0401 transgenic mice that would have been proteolytically destroyed under normal conditions. Additionally, this epitope was processed and presented by human DRB1*0401-positive Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B cells. 28 First reports on the influence of HLA-DR4 serotypes in the development of porcine insulin antibodies date back to the early 1980s. 29 The smaller glycine might endorse the binding of epitopes that contain larger amino acids in the vicinity of the substitution site or promote binding by a slight modification of the secondary structure. Although HLA-DRB1*0101 is similar to HLA-DRB1*0401 (both carry a glycine at position 86) and has analogous disease-modifying properties in MS, only HLA-DRB1*0401 influences antibody development to IFN-b. 30, 31 Although not significant in single-allele tests, the explorative haplotype analysis based on a score test for unkown linkage phase reveals a significant reduction of MX1 production in DRB1*0408-DQB1*0301 carriers. Additionally, haplotype analysis showed a significant increase of anti-IFN-b reactivity and reduced MX1 mRNA expression in DRB1*1601-DQB1*0502 carriers, pointing to alleles other than DRB1*0401 and DRB1*0408 that might be associated with the development of binding and neutralizing antibodies. This is especially true for HLA-DRB1*16 alleles that also potentially increase the risk to develop antibodies against IFN-b. On the other hand, DRB1*1101 alleles seem to have a protective effect with respect to antibody production. It has been recently shown that trans interactions of HLA-DRB1 alleles play a significant role in the susceptibility to MS. 32, 33 Such trans interactions might also play a role in the immunogenicity of biotherapeutics. Hence, this study suggests that further genetic studies should be undertaken to clarify the influence of hereditary factors in immunogenicity of biotherapeutics and improve treatment decisions.",
