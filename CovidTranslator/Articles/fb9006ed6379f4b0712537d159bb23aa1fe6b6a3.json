These ISGs encode distinct proteins with diverse biological effects that block multiple stages of the viral lifecycle including entry, translation, replication, assembly and spread. They also can have immunomodulatory functions including effects on leukocyte recruitment and priming of adaptive immunity.

More contemporary studies have expanded the analysis to several other ISGs, including APOBEC3 9 , BST2 (also known as tetherin) 10 , ISG15 11 and RSAD2 (also known as viperin) 12 , with progress made in understanding the mechanisms of IFN-mediated control and evasion by particular families of viruses (such as retroviruses 13 ). Moreover, systematic investigation of the antiviral functions of large groups of ISGs using ectopic gene screens 14, 15 has identified genes that coordinately control infection with several families of RNA and DNA viruses. There has been a resurgence of interest in defining ISGs with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, possibly as a means for identifying new classes of drugs that activate these genes directly; antiviral therapies that target host rather than viral proteins in theory could minimize the emergence of resistance and collateral effects associated with type I IFN therapy that limit its current clinical application. This Review describes recent advances in understanding the antiviral activity and mechanisms of action of two particular ISG families with broadspectrum antiviral activity: IFIT and IFITM proteins. While genetically and functionally distinct, an analysis of IFIT and IFITM proteins clarifies more generally how specific ISGs inhibit the replication, spread and disease pathogenesis of a range of human viruses.",

Recent studies showed that a West Nile virus (WNV) mutant lacking 2'-O methyltransferase activity was attenuated in wild type cells and mice but was pathogenic in the absence of Ifit1 expression 45, 46 . The mutant virus lacking 2'-O methyltransferase activity showed increased replication in peripheral tissues of Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mice after subcutaneous infection and a 16,000-fold decrease in lethal dose (LD50) value [G] in Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 compared with wild type mice. 2'-O methylation of viral RNA did not affect IFN induction in WNV-infected cells but instead modulated the antiviral effects of IFIT genes. Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2'-O methyltransferase activity had enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFIT proteins 45, 47 . It remains unclear whether IFIT proteins inhibit viruses lacking 2'-O methylation at the stage of protein translation by directly recognizing non-2'-O methylated viral RNA, thereby preventing recognition of viral RNA by the 43S pre-initiation complex, or by serving as a scaffold for other proteins that regulate translation (Fig 3). Wild type alphaviruses of the Togaviridae family of positive-stranded cytoplasmic RNA viruses lack 2'-O methylation on their viral RNA 48 and thus, should be sensitive to IFIT-mediated restriction.

Using a proteomics approach with 5'-ppp RNA as bait, mass spectrometry analysis identified IFIT1 as a primary binding partner. Subsequent experiments showed that only IFIT1 interacts directly with 5'-ppp on RNA, whereas IFIT2 and IFIT3 form a complex with IFIT1 that is required for function. These IFIT-dependent interactions were relevant against RNA viruses displaying a 5'-ppp, as silencing of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in HeLa cells to Diamond and Farzan varying degrees enhanced replication of the negative strand Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and influenza A virus, despite the fact that the production of IFN mRNA was unaffected. By contrast, ectopic expression of individual IFIT proteins in cells did not confer an inhibitory effect on these viruses, suggesting that the IFIT protein complex is required for this antiviral activity. Studies with Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mouse fibroblasts and myeloid cells also showed enhanced replication of VSV despite wild-type production levels of type I IFN and other inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were more vulnerable to infection with VSV, with higher virus-induced mortality observed. However, and in apparent conflict, experiments by a second group with the same VSV strain but an independently generated Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mouse revealed no difference in mortality compared with wild type mice over a wide range of VSV doses 51 . Instead, VSV infection was uniformly lethal in Ifit2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, a phenotype that was associated with enhanced replication in neurons of the brain but not in cells from other organs, such as lung and liver. Finally, a third study showed that gene silencing of IFIT3 in human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in decreased IFN -dependent antiviral activity against VSV, whereas ectopic expression of IFIT3 inhibited infection with both VSV and encephalomyocarditis virus, the latter being a picornavirus with a virally encoded genome-linked protein (Vpg) [G] at its 5' end that likely blocks the uncapped 5'-ppp 52 . Clearly, studies with additional RNA and DNA viruses and IFIT-deficient cells and mice are warranted to establish the mechanism of control of different families of viruses by IFIT genes.",

More recently, human IFIT1 and IFIT2 were reported to bind and inhibit Stimulator of IFN gene (STING, also known as MITA), which functions as a mitochondrial adaptor protein that recruits tank-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and IRF3 to a complex with mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor protein (MAVS, also known as IPS1, Cardif or VISA) resulting in the downstream induction of IFN in response to viral RNA or DNA 56 . Ectopic expression of IFIT1 in human 293T cells and macrophages inhibited the activation of IRF3, NF-B and IFN mRNA transcription in response to poly (I:C) and reversed poly(I:C)-induced inhibition of VSV infection. Moreover, silencing of IFIT1 inhibited VSV infection, presumably by modulating the IRF3-and IFN-dependent responses.

For example, both families include multiple, closely related members that lack obvious enzymatic activities. Most vertebrate animals have two or more IFITM genes. The human IFITM locus is located on chromosome 11 and composed of four functional genes: IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3 and IFITM5. IFITM4p is a pseudogene. Murine Ifitm1, Ifitm2, Ifitm3 and Ifitm5 are located on Diamond and Farzan chromosome 7 and are orthologues of their human counterparts. In addition, mice have two other IFITM genes: Ifitm6, which is syntenically located on chromosome 7, and Ifitm7, a retrogene located on chromosome 16. As in humans, murine Ifitm4 is a pseudogene 63 . IFITM proteins have a common topology with short luminal amino-and carboxy-termini, two anti-parallel transmembrane domains, and a short, conserved cytoplasmic domain ( Fig  5) . The first, more conserved, transmembrane domain includes two cysteine residues, at least one of which is modified by palmitylation 64 . Although several groups have confirmed this topology by flow cytometric recognition of amino-and carboxy-terminal tags, an alternative topology was proposed recently. According to this model, the putative transmembrane regions associate with the inner leaflet of the membrane, and both aminoand carboxy-terminal domains are located in the cytoplasm 65 . Evidence for this model ( Fig  5) includes the absence of N-linked glycans in the putative ectodomains despite the presence of native or engineered N-linked glycosylation sites, and the observation that the aminoterminal domain can be ubiquitinated. N-linked glycosylation and ubiquitin modifications typically are found in the lumenal and cytosolic domains of transmembrane proteins, respectively.",

Depletion of IFITM3 by siRNA or shRNA enhanced influenza A virus infection, and ectopic expression of IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 markedly inhibited influenza A virus replication. Surprisingly, retroviruses pseudotyped [G] with the influenza A virus hemagglutinin were affected similarly by IFITM depletion and ectopic expression, whereas retroviruses pseudotyped with the entry proteins of murine leukemia, Lassa, or Machupo viruses were not affected by the presence or Diamond and Farzan absence of IFITM proteins. This observation localized the restriction of influenza A virus by IFITM proteins to a hemagglutinin-mediated step in the virus lifecycle. Subsequent studies established that, uniquely among antiviral proteins, IFITM proteins interfered with a step in viral replication preceding fusion [G] of the viral and cellular membranes 73, 74 . There are several implications of this early restriction step. First, IFITM-mediated restriction precedes the induction of type I IFN in infected cells, which might explain the high basal level of expression of IFITM proteins in many tissues. IFN induction, however, can amplify IFITM expression and protect uninfected cells in a paracrine manner, and acute-phase cytokines such as IL-6 might induce IFITM protein expression systemically. Second, viral escape from restriction by IFITM proteins could be more challenging than for antagonizing inhibitory factors that function at later stages of the virus lifecycle. For example, viral proteins such as HIV-1 vif and vpu, which are generated after entry, evade host responses mediated by APOBEC3G or BST2 that affect replication and viral assembly by degrading these restriction factors. In comparison, because IFITM-mediated restriction precedes infection, the opportunity for de novo synthesis of viral inhibitors is not available, and the virion must carry a protein that counteracts IFITM-mediated restriction (which is less likely given the relatively small amount of viral protein that is delivered to a cell) or alter its site of fusion with host cell membranes (Fig 6) .",

Vesicular stomatitis virus is weakly restricted by IFITM proteins, and HIV-1 might be restricted in a cell-type specific manner 14, 77 . These varying degrees of restriction also are observed for retroviruses pseudotyped with the entry proteins of different viruses. Viruses that are restricted by IFITM proteins tend to fuse with host cell membranes in a late endosome or lysosome.

Ectopic expression of IFITM proteins does not alter the expression of virus receptors, affect the pH of endosomal compartments, or interfere with cathepsin activity necessary for fusion of some restricted viruses. Although IFITM proteins can be detected on the plasma membrane, particularly when over-expressed or induced by IFN, they are enriched in intracellular compartments, including late endosomes, where restricted viruses fuse. Two models have been proposed to Diamond and Farzan explain the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins 73, 74 (Fig 6) . In the first model, IFITM proteins are hypothesized to modify endosomal or lysosomal vesicles such that they become inhospitable to viral fusion. This could occur by altering the lipid components of the vesicle membrane, by enriching vesicles with non-specific proteases that inactivate entry proteins or, as proposed recently 80 , by interfering with the activity of the v-ATPase responsible for endosomal acidification. In the second model, IFITM proteins could alter the rate or pattern of vesicle trafficking such that viruses are redirected to a non-fusogenic pathway. Expression of IFITM proteins in many cell lines induces large vacuoles, suggesting some interference with vesicle trafficking, fusion, or resolution 73 . However, the presence and size of these vacuoles do not correlate with the efficiency of restriction, and morphological changes were not observed when endogenous IFITM proteins were depleted, despite greater influenza A virus replication in these cells 72, 74 . As with the IFIT proteins, the absence of obvious enzymatic domains in the IFITM proteins suggests that cellular cofactors are necessary for antiviral activity. Consistent with this possibility, IFITM proteins have species-specific signature sequences that are localized at the cytoplasmic base of both transmembrane domains (see Fig 5) .",

In mammalian cells, this response is initiated after detection of non-self pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), including single-stranded and double-stranded viral nucleic acids. These viral PAMPs are detected by specific host pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9), RIG-I-like receptors (MDA5 and RIG-I) and DNA sensors (DAI, IFI16, DHX9 and DHX36) in the endosome and within the cytoplasm 1, 2 . Binding of viral PAMPs to these PRRs triggers signaling cascades that induce the expression of virus-responsive genes and pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as type I interferon (IFN)), which restrict virus replication and modulate adaptive immunity (Fig 1) .",

Type I IFNs are a family of functionally and genetically related cytokines consisting of several members, with IFN and IFN the most extensively studied 3 . Type I IFN signaling is mediated through a common receptor, the IFN / receptor (IFNAR), which is composed of a heterodimer of IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 subunits 4 . Signal transduction following the binding of type I IFN to IFNAR occurs via Janus kinase (JAK) and Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins and results in translocation of the transcription factor complex IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3, which is comprised of IFN regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) and phoshorylated STAT1 and STAT2) into the nucleus, which induces the transcription of hundreds (estimated 500 to 1,000 genes per cell or tissue 5-7 ) of different interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) [G]. These ISGs encode distinct proteins with diverse biological effects that block multiple stages of the viral lifecycle including entry, translation, replication, assembly and spread. They also can have immunomodulatory functions including effects on leukocyte recruitment and priming of adaptive immunity. Beyond this, a subset of ISGs is induced in an IFN-independent manner after viral infection through the actions of transcription factors (such as IRF3) that respond directly to signals downstream of PRRs.",

More contemporary studies have expanded the analysis to several other ISGs, including APOBEC3 9 , BST2 (also known as tetherin) 10 , ISG15 11 and RSAD2 (also known as viperin) 12 , with progress made in understanding the mechanisms of IFN-mediated control and evasion by particular families of viruses (such as retroviruses 13 ). Moreover, systematic investigation of the antiviral functions of large groups of ISGs using ectopic gene screens 14, 15 has identified genes that coordinately control infection with several families of RNA and DNA viruses. There has been a resurgence of interest in defining ISGs with broad-spectrum antiviral activity, possibly as a means for identifying new classes of drugs that activate these genes directly; antiviral therapies that target host rather than viral proteins in theory could minimize the emergence of resistance and collateral effects associated with type I IFN therapy that limit its current clinical application. This Review describes recent advances in understanding the antiviral activity and mechanisms of action of two particular ISG families with broadspectrum antiviral activity: IFIT and IFITM proteins. While genetically and functionally distinct, an analysis of IFIT and IFITM proteins clarifies more generally how specific ISGs inhibit the replication, spread and disease pathogenesis of a range of human viruses.",

Moreover, IFIT2 had a positively charged C-terminal region that supported RNA binding, and mutation or deletion of charged residues in this region altered viral RNA binding and negatively affected antiviral activity against Newcastle disease virus. As this study also suggested that IFIT2 can bind RNA containing AU-rich elements, which are sometimes found in mRNA of proteins that encode cytokines or apoptotic factors, this may be a possible mechanism by which IFIT proteins regulate inflammatory responses (see below).",

Using a proteomics approach with 5'-ppp RNA as bait, mass spectrometry analysis identified IFIT1 as a primary binding partner. Subsequent experiments showed that only IFIT1 interacts directly with 5'-ppp on RNA, whereas IFIT2 and IFIT3 form a complex with IFIT1 that is required for function. These IFIT-dependent interactions were relevant against RNA viruses displaying a 5'-ppp, as silencing of IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3 in HeLa cells to varying degrees enhanced replication of the negative strand Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and influenza A virus, despite the fact that the production of IFN mRNA was unaffected. By contrast, ectopic expression of individual IFIT proteins in cells did not confer an inhibitory effect on these viruses, suggesting that the IFIT protein complex is required for this antiviral activity. Studies with Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mouse fibroblasts and myeloid cells also showed enhanced replication of VSV despite wild-type production levels of type I IFN and other inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mice were more vulnerable to infection with VSV, with higher virus-induced mortality observed. However, and in apparent conflict, experiments by a second group with the same VSV strain but an independently generated Ifit1 \u2212/\u2212 mouse revealed no difference in mortality compared with wild type mice over a wide range of VSV doses 51 . Instead, VSV infection was uniformly lethal in Ifit2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, a phenotype that was associated with enhanced replication in neurons of the brain but not in cells from other organs, such as lung and liver. Finally, a third study showed that gene silencing of IFIT3 in human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells resulted in decreased IFN -dependent antiviral activity against VSV, whereas ectopic expression of IFIT3 inhibited infection with both VSV and encephalomyocarditis virus, the latter being a picornavirus with a virally encoded genome-linked protein (Vpg) [G] at its 5' end that likely blocks the uncapped 5'-ppp 52 . Clearly, studies with additional RNA and DNA viruses and IFIT-deficient cells and mice are warranted to establish the mechanism of control of different families of viruses by IFIT genes.",

One showed that ectopic expression of Ifit2 in mouse macrophages inhibited LPS-induced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and CXCL2 (also known as MIP2), and that this effect was mediated post-transcriptionally, possibly by affecting mRNA stability 55 . More recently, human IFIT1 and IFIT2 were reported to bind and inhibit Stimulator of IFN gene (STING, also known as MITA), which functions as a mitochondrial adaptor protein that recruits tank-binding kinase-1 (TBK1) and IRF3 to a complex with mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor protein (MAVS, also known as IPS1, Cardif or VISA) resulting in the downstream induction of IFN in response to viral RNA or DNA 56 . Ectopic expression of IFIT1 in human 293T cells and macrophages inhibited the activation of IRF3, NF-B and IFN mRNA transcription in response to poly (I:C) and reversed poly(I:C)-induced inhibition of VSV infection. Moreover, silencing of IFIT1 inhibited VSV infection, presumably by modulating the IRF3-and IFN-dependent responses.

Over the past decade, it has become clear that this family of related proteins inhibits viral infections through multiple mechanisms including suppression of translation initiation, binding of uncapped or incompletely capped viral RNA, and sequestering viral proteins or RNA in the cytoplasm. Moreover, recent functional studies suggest, through pathways that remain to be defined and/or corroborated, that IFIT family members additionally may regulate cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic immune responses. As new structural and functional insight is gained about individual IFIT family members, likely, we will begin to appreciate the basis and complexity of ligand interactions that explain their distinct functions in controlling viral pathogenesis and possibly, minimizing immunemediated damage to the host.",

            "text": "An antiviral role for IFITM3 was discovered in an RNA interference screen for factors modulating influenza A virus infection 72 . Depletion of IFITM3 by siRNA or shRNA enhanced influenza A virus infection, and ectopic expression of IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 markedly inhibited influenza A virus replication. Surprisingly, retroviruses pseudotyped [G] with the influenza A virus hemagglutinin were affected similarly by IFITM depletion and ectopic expression, whereas retroviruses pseudotyped with the entry proteins of murine leukemia, Lassa, or Machupo viruses were not affected by the presence or absence of IFITM proteins. This observation localized the restriction of influenza A virus by IFITM proteins to a hemagglutinin-mediated step in the virus lifecycle. Subsequent studies established that, uniquely among antiviral proteins, IFITM proteins interfered with a step in viral replication preceding fusion [G] of the viral and cellular membranes 73, 74 . There are several implications of this early restriction step. First, IFITM-mediated restriction precedes the induction of type I IFN in infected cells, which might explain the high basal level of expression of IFITM proteins in many tissues. IFN induction, however, can amplify IFITM expression and protect uninfected cells in a paracrine manner, and acute-phase cytokines such as IL-6 might induce IFITM protein expression systemically. Second, viral escape from restriction by IFITM proteins could be more challenging than for antagonizing inhibitory factors that function at later stages of the virus lifecycle. For example, viral proteins such as HIV-1 vif and vpu, which are generated after entry, evade host responses mediated by APOBEC3G or BST2 that affect replication and viral assembly by degrading these restriction factors. In comparison, because IFITM-mediated restriction precedes infection, the opportunity for de novo synthesis of viral inhibitors is not available, and the virion must carry a protein that counteracts IFITM-mediated restriction (which is less likely given the relatively small amount of viral protein that is delivered to a cell) or alter its site of fusion with host cell membranes (Fig 6) .",

By contrast, infection with alphaviruses, arenaviruses and murine leukemia virus (a retrovirus) seems to be unaffected by IFITM protein expression. Vesicular stomatitis virus is weakly restricted by IFITM proteins, and HIV-1 might be restricted in a cell-type specific manner 14, 77 . These varying degrees of restriction also are observed for retroviruses pseudotyped with the entry proteins of different viruses. Viruses that are restricted by IFITM proteins tend to fuse with host cell membranes in a late endosome or lysosome. Indeed, when retroviruses bearing the entry protein of the SARS coronavirus were induced by trypsin to fuse at the plasma membrane, IFITM-mediated restriction was bypassed, establishing that the site of fusion is crucial for the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins 74 .",

Ectopic expression of IFITM proteins does not alter the expression of virus receptors, affect the pH of endosomal compartments, or interfere with cathepsin activity necessary for fusion of some restricted viruses. Although IFITM proteins can be detected on the plasma membrane, particularly when over-expressed or induced by IFN, they are enriched in intracellular compartments, including late endosomes, where restricted viruses fuse. Two models have been proposed to explain the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins 73, 74 (Fig 6) . In the first model, IFITM proteins are hypothesized to modify endosomal or lysosomal vesicles such that they become inhospitable to viral fusion. This could occur by altering the lipid components of the vesicle membrane, by enriching vesicles with non-specific proteases that inactivate entry proteins or, as proposed recently 80 , by interfering with the activity of the v-ATPase responsible for endosomal acidification. In the second model, IFITM proteins could alter the rate or pattern of vesicle trafficking such that viruses are redirected to a non-fusogenic pathway. Expression of IFITM proteins in many cell lines induces large vacuoles, suggesting some interference with vesicle trafficking, fusion, or resolution 73 . However, the presence and size of these vacuoles do not correlate with the efficiency of restriction, and morphological changes were not observed when endogenous IFITM proteins were depleted, despite greater influenza A virus replication in these cells 72, 74 . As with the IFIT proteins, the absence of obvious enzymatic domains in the IFITM proteins suggests that cellular cofactors are necessary for antiviral activity. Consistent with this possibility, IFITM proteins have species-specific signature sequences that are localized at the cytoplasmic base of both transmembrane domains (see Fig 5) .",

Although other functions have been suggested, the primary role of IFITM proteins appears to be antiviral. IFITM3 in particular significantly contributes to the control of influenza A virus in vivo, and tissue culture studies suggest that several of the other IFITM proteins help to restrict infection of other enveloped viruses. Expression of IFITM proteins makes cells refractory to steps in the infection cycle that precede viral fusion, but the means by which they do so remain incompletely defined. It is also remains poorly understood how IFITM proteins differentially restrict different viruses, and whether they can modulate the replication of other pathogens including non-enveloped viruses, bacteria, and parasites. As with IFIT proteins, additional work characterizing their activity and regulation may suggest more tailored approaches to controlling infection by specific pathogens.",

IFIT proteins function in the cytoplasm, whereas IFITM proteins traverse the membrane and are enriched in late endosomes and lysosomes. IFIT proteins suppress translation initiation, bind and sequester uncapped viral RNA, and sequester at least one viral protein (HPV E1) in the cytoplasm. IFITM proteins, by contrast, prevent several enveloped viruses from crossing endosomal or lysosomal membranes and penetrating into the cytoplasm. Moreover, IFIT proteins are expressed poorly, if at all, in the absence of inflammatory or danger signals, whereas IFITM proteins are expressed basally in many tissues. IFITM proteins generally are induced to greater levels by IFN , and possibly by members of the gp130 (IL-6)-family of cytokines. However, although there are many differences, there are some parallels between IFIT and IFITM proteins. Compared with the APOBEC families of restriction factors, the IFIT and IFITM families target a wider range of viruses. Moreover, and similar to APOBEC proteins, IFIT and IFITM families have specialized paralogues, perhaps reflecting an evolutionary arms race with pathogens. A deeper understanding of the antiviral activity and mechanism of action of the members of each family may facilitate the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents that mimic or amplify their activities.",

The figure was prepared with PyMOL (http://pymol.org/) and is adapted from the original publication 20 . Viruses fuse with host cell membranes in different compartments within the endocytic pathway, and IFITM-mediated restriction activity correlates with the site of fusion. For example, arenaviruses such as Junin and Machupo viruses, follow the recycling pathway of their common receptor, transferrin receptor 1 82 . These viruses are not susceptible to IFITMmediated restriction. By contrast, viruses such as influenza A virus fuse in late endosomes and are restricted by IFITM proteins, particularly by IFITM3 72 . Viruses such as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Ebola virus depend on lysosomal cathepsins and other lysosome-resident proteins, and are more restricted by IFITM1 74 . Murine IFITM6 is more specialized and restricts the entry of Ebola virus and SARS-CoV, but not influenza A virus. Trypsin treatment of SARS-CoV allows it to fuse at the plasma membrane and bypass IFITM-mediated restriction. Retroviruses pseudotyped with entry proteins from these viruses show identical patterns of restriction, implicating the entry process in the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins.

Poxvirus and coronavirus mutants that lacked 2'-O methyltransferase activity had enhanced sensitivity to the antiviral actions of IFIT proteins 45, 47 . It remains unclear whether IFIT proteins inhibit viruses lacking 2'-O methylation at the stage of protein translation by directly recognizing non-2'-O methylated viral RNA, thereby preventing recognition of viral RNA by the 43S pre-initiation complex, or by serving as a scaffold for other proteins that regulate translation (Fig 3). Wild type alphaviruses of the Togaviridae family of positive-stranded cytoplasmic RNA viruses lack 2'-O methylation on their viral RNA 48 and thus, should be sensitive to IFIT-mediated restriction. Although further mechanistic studies are warranted, in support of this, ectopic expression of Ifit1 inhibited infection by the Sindbis alphavirus, and reciprocally, silencing of Ifit1 resulted in enhanced infection 49 .",

Human IFIT1 and IFIT2 bind eIF3e and human IFIT2, mouse IFIT1 and mouse IFIT2 bind eIF3c. (Right) Scheme of translation initiation and the steps putatively blocked by IFIT family members. To begin translation in mammalian cells, a free pool of 40S ribosomal subunits is stabilized by eIF3 and binds to the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA) in the presence of eiF1 (not shown). This allows assembly of the 43S preinitiation complex, which then binds mRNA that is capped and methylated at the N-7 and 2'-O positions. This interaction is stabilized by eIF4E and eIF4G, which results in the formation of the 43S-mRNA complex, which is competent for AUG (start codon) scanning and translation. For HCV genomic mRNA with an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), association with eIF4E and eiF4G or other cap-binding factors is not required to stabilize the 43S-mRNA complex. a-c. IFIT-mediated inhibition of translation based on published data27,37,38,40,41 : (a) IFIT1 and IFIT2 binding to eIF3e blocks binding of eIF3e to the ternary complex (eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA); (b) Binding of human IFIT2, and mouse IFIT1 and IFIT2, to eIF4c blocks formation of the 43S pre-initiation complex; (c) Human IFIT1 binding to eIF3 blocks HCV IRES recognition of the 43S complex. Disruption of eIF3 binding to the HCV IRES also can prevent eIF2 recruitment and suppresses ternary complex formation. d-e. Possible mechanisms for mouse IFIT1-mediated inhibition of viral RNA",

            "text": "IFIT proteins recognize the 5'-ppp of viral RNA and inhibit infectionViral infection by negative-stranded RNA viruses (such as RVFV, VSV or influenza A virus) generates uncapped 5'-ppp on their single-or double-stranded RNA. These are recognized by cytoplasmic sensors (RIG-I and MDA5), which induce the expression of IFNstimulated genes (ISGs) including IFIT1, IFIT2 and IFIT3, by both IFN -dependent andindependent (for example, IRF3-dependent) pathways. IFIT1 functions as a sensor of viral RNA containing the 5'-ppp, resulting in assembly of an IFIT1-IFIT2-IFIT3 complex. This presumably inhibits viral infection by sequestering RNA (or promoting degradation) of the actively replicating pool. Data are conflicting as to whether IFIT proteins also promote or inhibit the host inflammatory response, possibly by changing the relative amount of viral RNA in the cell with free 5'-ppp ends.

In the first model, the amino and carboxyl termini are located in the lumen of IFITM-containing vesicles, and the hydrophobic regions fully traverse the membrane (top left). Yount et al65 have proposed an alternative model in which both termini are oriented toward the cytoplasm, and hydrophobic domains are embedded in the membrane without traversing it (top right). A yellow dot in both models indicates the site of a palmityl group that is important for protein stability and restriction activity 64 .

Note that the conservation of the first transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic domain is based on the first topology model. The site of palmityl addition is highlighted in yellow.
