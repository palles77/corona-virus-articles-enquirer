            "text": "African swine fever virus (ASFV) is the causal agent of a highly-contagious and fatal disease of domestic pigs, leading to serious socio-economic consequences in affected countries. Once, neither an anti-viral drug nor an effective vaccines are available, studies on new anti-ASFV molecules are urgently need. Recently, it has been shown that ASFV type II topoisomerase (ASFV-topo II) is inhibited by several fluoroquinolones (bacterial DNA topoisomerase inhibitors), raising the idea that this viral enzyme can be a potential target for drug development against ASFV. Here, we report that genistein hampers ASFV infection at non-cytotoxic concentrations in Vero cells and porcine macrophages. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of this isoflavone, previously described as a topo II poison in eukaryotes, is maximal when it is added to cells at middle-phase of infection (8 hpi), disrupting viral DNA replication, blocking the transcription of late viral genes as well as the synthesis of late viral proteins, reducing viral progeny. Further, the single cell electrophoresis analysis revealed the presence of fragmented ASFV genomes in cells exposed to genistein, suggesting that this molecule also acts as an ASFV-topo II poison and not as a reversible inhibitor. No antiviral effects were detected when genistein was added before or at entry phase of ASFV infection. Molecular docking studies demonstrated that genistein may interact with four residues of the ATP-binding site of ASFV-topo II , showing more binding affinity (\u22124.62 kcal/mol) than ATP 4\u2212 (\u22123.02 kcal/mol), emphasizing the idea that this viral enzyme has an essential role during viral genome replication and can be a good target for drug development against ASFV.",

It is the causative agent of African swine fever (ASF), a highly contagious transboundary disease of domestic and wild pigs. Depending on circulating viral strain, clinical signs may vary from the highly lethal form with 100% mortality to subclinical and asymptomatic forms (Gallardo et al., 2015) . Although ASF was eradicated from Europe (except Sardinia) in 1995, it was reemerged in the Caucasus region in 2007 and has spread to the Russian Federation, Ukraine, Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Moldova, causing serious socio-economic impact on affected countries (Gallardo et al., 2015) . The fact that no vaccine is available makes antiviral research a strong priority in the ASFV field (Zakaryan and Revilla, 2016) .",

Interestingly, one of the many biological effects of flavonoids is their antiviral activity. For example, apigenin extracted from Ocimum basilicum showed a potent antiviral activity against adenoviruses and hepatitis B virus (Chiang et al., 2005) whereas quercetin demonstrated a dose-dependent antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus (Lyu et al., 2005) , Japanese encephalitis virus (Johari et al., 2012) , hepatitis C virus in vitro (Rojas et al., 2016) ; and influenza A subtypes in vivo (Cho et al., 2015) . Similarly, genistein was shown to inhibit HIV infection in resting CD4 T cells through interference with HIV-mediated actin dynamics (Guo et al., 2013) .

We also demonstrated that the major antiviral effect was observed when genistein was added at time point coincided with the viral DNA synthesis, suggesting that this event could be impaired by genistein. Further experiments confirmed that genistein inhibited viral DNA replication and protein synthesis.

The strong antiviral effect was also observed, when genistein was added at 0 and 2 hpi (P < 0.05). In contrast, genistein showed no inhibitory effect on ASFV infection, when cells were treated before infection. Taken together, these results indicate that early and middle stages of ASFV infection can be disrupted by genistein.",

In the absence of an available X-ray crystal structure of ASFV-topo II, we constructed ASFV- topo II homology model based on the structures of its close homologues. Homology modeling was followed by the process of reliability verification of the ASFV-topo II model tertiary structure. The stereochemical correctness of protein was carried out and the result of this test was visualized as a Ramachandran plot (Fig. 1S ). Since topo II has two Mg 2+ ions as cofactor per subunit, two Mg 2+ ions were docked with the obtained ASFV-topo II model. After obtaining the ASFV-topo II tertiary structure model in complex with two Mg 2+ ions, a proteinprotein docking of the obtained model with itself was carried out. The crystal structure of DNA topoisomerase II dimer from Saccharomyces cerevisiae [PDB: 4GFH] was used as an object for evaluation. As a result of the protein-protein docking, 10 5 models were obtained of the ASFVtopo II dimer structure. The model with the lowest interaction energy (\u2212106.1 kcal/mol) and the lowest RMSD (8.974 \u212b) compared with the 4GFH structure was chosen as the best one. The structure of the best obtained ASFV-topo II dimer model in the complex with four Mg 2+ ions was solvated by a water shell 7 \u00c5 thick around it. After that, the system was neutralized by Cl \u2212 , Na + and Mg 2+ ions in the concentration of 150 mM. The size of the resulting system was 101611 atoms (19158 -ASFV-TOPOII-A, 19158 -ASFV-TOPOII-B, 63138 -H 2 O, 57 -Na + , 95 -Cl \u2212 , 5 -Mg 2+ ). The resulting system was subjected to 30,000 steps of a SD minimization algorithm and to 60,000 steps of ABNR minimization algorithm. The energy of the obtained system was \u2212193785 kcal/mol. The final ASFV-topo II dimer model is presented in Fig. 4C . For docking analysis, we selected all amino acids in the ATP-binding site (16 amino acids) as possible interaction sites with genistein. The top ranking model based on the smallest ICM score value and visual analysis is shown as 3D snapshot and 2D plot of genistein interacting side chains of the ASFV-topo II dimer model (Fig. 4D) . Genistein formed hydrogen bonds with the ATP-binding site residues Asn-144, Val-146, Gly-147 and Leu-148. Binding energy values revealed that genistein bound to the ATP-binding site (\u22124.62 kcal/mol) with more affinity as compared to ATP 4\u2212 (\u22123.02 kcal/mol) (Table 2) (Fig. 2S) , suggesting that genistein could effectively compete with ATP 4\u2212 for the binding site.",

As shown in Fig. 5A , genistein inhibited ASFV infection in a dose-dependent manner, and it was not effective at concentrations lower than 50 \u03bcM (P < 0.05). The IC 50 of genistein for ASFV Armenia/07 strain was higher (IC 50 = 17 \u03bcM; SI = 24.1) than that reported for ASFV Ba71V. In agreement with previous observation, the strongest reduction (2.5 log; > 99%) in viral titer was found when genistein treatment was initiated at 8 hpi (P < 0.001) (Fig. 5B) . The antiviral effect was less pronounced when genistein was added early or late in the replication cycle. No virucidal and anti-entry activity were observed (data not shown). Finally, a significant decrease (41%, P < 0.02) in the amount of viral DNA in ASFV factories was observed, when ASFV-infected macrophages were exposed to genistein at 8 hpi (Fig. 5C) .

However, none of them have been taken forward for commercial production (Zakaryan and Revilla, 2016; Arias et al., 2017) . It is in this context that we conducted the antiviral screening of different compounds for the development of effective antiviral therapeutics (Hakobyan et al., 2016 (Hakobyan et al., , 2018 . One such compound, genistein, has been shown to inhibit replication of different viruses through diverse mechanisms. For instance, genistein inhibits human cytomegalovirus via blocking viral immediate-early protein function (Evers et al., 2005) and Pichinde virus by disrupting the activation of the viral transcription factor-2 in Vero cells (Vela et al., 2008) . Additionally, genistein was shown to suppress the replication of avian leukosis virus subgroup J by inhibiting virus transcription (Qian et al., 2014) . Genistein can also inhibit HIV infection by blocking the viral protein U, which is believed to form ionic channels in the infected cell (Sauter et al., 2014) . We previously reported that ASFV was sensitive to genistein, though at concentrations that were toxic in this study (Hakobyan et al., 2016) . Differences in non-toxic concentrations can be explained by the previously used method to measure cytotoxicity, crystal violet assay, which is less sensitive than MTT used in this study. Here we demonstrated that genistein at 50 \u03bcM concentration exhibited significant antiviral properties against ASFV infection in vitro, both in Vero cells and porcine macrophages. Antiviral assays revealed no virucidal effect on extracellular ASFV particles, as well as no interference in viral attachment and internalization steps. Furthermore, the pre-treatment of Vero cells with genistein also failed to inhibit ASFV infection, suggesting that this compound did not affect the host effectors or other regulatory factors. Significant differences compared to control are denoted by *(P < 0.05), **(P < 0.02) and ***(P < 0.001).",

            "text": "These results indicated that genistein targeted the post-entry stages of ASFV infection, also supported by the fact that genistein showed higher efficiency when added at 8 hpi. This time point coincides with the initiation of the cytoplasmic phase of viral DNA replication (Garc\u00eda-Beato et al., 1992; Rojo et al., 1999; Sim\u00f5es et al., 2015) , and, therefore, we assumed that genistein could interfere with this process. For this reason, we quantified the DNA content in viral factories using image cytometry. The reduction of ASFV DNA in genistein-treated cells suggested that this compound inhibited viral DNA replication. This scenario was further supported by a reduction of viral gene expression and absence of the late viral protein p72 in porcine macrophages and Vero cells exposed to genistein, since it is known that expression of late viral genes does not occur in presence of viral DNA replication inhibitors (Rodr\u00edguez and Salas, 2013) . The rapid metabolic inactivation and short half-life of genistein may explain why its inhibitory effect on DNA replication and viral yield was less profound, when it was added at early times post-infection (Chang et al., 2000; Yang et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Currently, there are several flavonoids that inhibit DNA and RNA virus by targeting enzymes involved in genome replication and transcription. For example, quercetin and myricetin are strong inhibitors of HIV reverse transcriptase (Ono et al., 1990) , while wogonin has been shown to suppress duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) DNA polymerase in infected ducks (Guo et al., 2007) . Furthermore, myricetin and scutellarein inhibit SARS-coronavirus infection by affecting the ATPase activity of viral helicase protein (Yu et al., 2012) . However, to our knowledge, there is no evidence that genistein may inhibit viral infection through interaction with enzymes involved in the process of viral DNA or RNA replication, although some early data suggested that genistein may stabilize the complex between topo II and DNA, thereby inducing topo II-mediated double-stranded breakage Kiguchi et al., 1990) . Recently, Coelho et al. (2016) showed that genistein at 32 \u03bcM concentration inhibited the activity of recombinant ASFV-topo II, purified from yeast. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that genistein interrupted ASFV DNA replication by inhibiting the viral topo II. Therefore, we expected a significant induction of DNA double-stranded breaks in ASFV-infected and genistein-treated cells. As expected, genistein was found to significantly induce DNA fragmentation, particularly at late phase (13 hpi) of infection. This phase is characterized by a high rate of ASFV DNA synthesis in Vero cells (Rojo et al., 1999) . Thus, the inhibition of ASFV-topo II when it was more needed for viral genome replication caused a dramatic increase in topo II-mediated double-stranded breaks. Our hypothesis is further sustained by molecular docking analysis. Based on the fact that all members of topo II family are highly conserved proteins (Forterre and Gadelle, 2009; Forterre et al., 2007) , we constructed ASFV-topo II homology model with two Mg 2+ ions. We identified that genistein may interact with four amino acid residues in the predicted ATP-binding site with higher binding affinity than ATP 4\u2212 . All topo II enzymes catalyze changes in DNA topology in reactions coupled to the hydrolysis of ATP (Bates and Maxwell, 2010) . Although it is unclear why topo II consumes ATP to support reactions that do not require energy input, it has been proposed that the energy of ATP hydrolysis is needed to control the separation of protein-protein interfaces and prevent the accidental formation of double-stranded breaks (Bates et al., 2011) . Therefore, the ATP-competitive inhibitors like genistein increase the rate of DNA fragmentation upon treatment. On the other hand, competition for the ATP-binding site should inhibit the rate of enzymecatalyzed ATP hydrolysis. Indeed, early studies showed that genistein was a potent inhibitor of topo II-mediated ATP hydrolysis in Drosophila melanogaster Kc tissue culture cells (Robinson et al., 1993) , suggesting that our docking results are in accordance with earlier findings.",

            "text": "Since the ATP-binding site of topo II is highly conserved among ASFV strains, genistein and other competitive inhibitors can be potent antivirals against virulent strains currently circulating in Africa and Eastern Europe. Here we showed that genistein was highly effective not only against avirulent ASFV Ba71V strain but also against ASFV Armenia/07 strain, which causes 100% mortality in domestic pigs. Thus, ASFV-topo II enzyme may be an excellent target for anti-ASFV agents. We suppose that greater effort should focus on the development of effective antiviral drugs that can be applied to treat infected pigs and thus to control the spread of infection. In developing a drug for pig health, there should be a necessary balance between the level of a compound's antiviral activity and the cost of preparing the compound. Therefore, the natural compounds like genistein are the center of our attention due to their high availabilities and low cost and side effects. Fig. 6 . Genistein inhibits viral transcription and protein synthesis in macrophages infected with the ASFV-Armenia/07 strain. (A) qRT-PCR analysis of an early viral gene (CP204L) and two late genes (A104R, B646L), at different time points, after infection of porcine macrophages with the ASFV Armenia/07 isolate (MOI = 0.5). (B) Viral gene expression analysis of the same viral transcripts in ASFV-infected porcine macrophages treated with Genistein (50 \u03bcM) at 8 hpi, during 1 h. Mock-infected macrophages were used as a control in both assays. The results are shown as averages \u00b1 standard errors (SE) between the number of molecules of each viral gene and the number of molecules of the housekeeping gene Cyclophilin A. The results were obtained from three independent experiments. (C) Viral protein synthesis was analyzed in non-treated and genistein-treated porcine macrophages (10 \u03bcM and 50 \u03bcM), at 16 hpi. Molecular weights (kDa) of the evaluated viral proteins are indicated on the left of immunoblot image and the \u03b1-tubulin was used as a loading control.",
