            "text": "Structure-based drug design (SBDD) has emerged as a valuable pharmaceutical lead discovery tool, showing potential for accelerating the discovery process, while reducing developmental costs and boosting potencies of the drug that is ultimately selected. SBDD is a iterative, rational, lead compound sculpting process that involves both the synthesis of new derivatives and the evaluation of their binding to the target structure either through computational docking or elucidation of the target structure as a complex with the lead compound. This method heavily relies on the production of high-resolution (< 2\u00c5) three-dimensional structures of the drug target, obtained through X-ray crystallographic analysis, in the presence or absence of the drug candidate. The lack of generalized methods for high quality crystal production is still a major bottleneck in the process of macromolecular crystallization. This review provides a brief introduction to SBDD and describes several macromolecular crystallization strategies, with an emphasis on advances and challenges facing researchers in the field today. Recent trends in the development of more universal macromolecular crystallization techniques, particularly nucleation-based techniques that are applicable to both soluble and integral membrane proteins, are also discussed.",

Although significant advances have been made using library-based screening strategies [3] for new lead identification, it has become increasingly clear that SBDD has even greater potential for accelerating the time to market for new pharmaceuticals entities and significantly reducing their cost of development.",

This method utilizes computational analysis of target-lead complementarity using three-dimensional structures of the target or target-lead complex [1] so that both favorable and unfavorable lipophilic, hydrogen-bonding and polar interactions of the target-lead complex can be identified [4] [5] [6] . Structural refinements of the lead often emerge from target-lead complex crystals and analysis of the resulting high-resolution X-ray structures. An alternative approach, i.e., virtual screening, utilizes molecular docking simulations to screen libraries of potential small molecule leads to estimate the biological activity of successful drug candidates [7] [8] [9] [10] . Regardless of the initial approach, the pharmaceutical properties of lead compounds (e.g., log P, bioavailability, metabolic toxicity, pharmacokinetics, structure-activity relationships, potency, etc) are continually optimized until a drug candidate is identified for clinical evaluation [4] .",

HIV-1 protease is a critical enzyme in the life cycle of HIV, the retrovirus that causes autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Since the elucidation of its structure in 1989, SBDD strategies have led to the introduction of three first-generation HIV protease inhibitors: Hoffman-La Roche's Invirase\u2122 (saquinavir), Abbott's Norvir\u2122 (ritonavir), and Merck Inc.'s Crixivan\u00ae (indinavir), as well as several more potent inhibitors in recent years [11] [12] . For example, Mahalingam and coworkers developed a series of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, with activities that were up to 56 times more potent than current analogs [12] . The structure of the most potent inhibitor, co-crystallized with HIV-1 protease, is shown in Figure 2 . This agent is considerably more potent (EC 50 =7 nM) than indinavir (EC 50 = 50 nM) and is as potent as atazanavir (EC 50 =8 nM), the first protease inhibitor to be given on a once-a-day basis [13] . SBDD clearly has accelerated the process of drug development for HIV treatment since there have been more FDA approved drugs for its treatment than for all other viral infections combined [13] . Structure-based studies of other infectious diseases have resulted in the introduction of more than 200 active drugs on the market [4, 6, [14] [15] , including those for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) [16] [17] and influenza A virus [18] [19] .",

Structure elucidation of protein targets can be obtained from either X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques; however, most protein targets used in SBDD have been obtained using X-ray crystallography. Despite their capacities to solve structures at atomic resolution, they both have practical limitations. X-ray crystallography is the most cost-effective and widely used tool; however, the structure determination rate and ultimate resolution are governed by the ability to grow large (> 10\u00b5m/side) diffraction quality crystals. This bottleneck illustrates another drawback of X-ray methods, i.e., the large amount of protein required to enable the screening of many crystallization conditions to discover those that are capable of producing high-quality single crystals. Structures of proteins up to approximately 30 kD can be determined in solution using techniques such as 2D nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY) to observe interactions between hydrogen atoms that are in close proximity (< 5 \u00c5 apart) within a polypeptide backbone of known sequence. This process is labor-intensive since 15 N-and 13 C-enriched forms of the protein must be expressed in order to resolve overlapping peaks in 2D NOESY spectra.",

This has been especially problematic for the analysis of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a very important family of membrane proteins involved in cellular signaling that encode roughly 21% of the genes of known function [20] [21] and represent 50-60% of current drug targets [22] . Drugs targeting GPCRs have been known for more than 50 years for cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, and oncologic diseases [22] , even though the molecular details of the GPCR family have been limited until elucidation of the human \u03b2 2 adrenergic receptor (\u03b2 2 AR) crystal structure in 2007 [23] [24] . This high-resolution structure enabled the rapid development of more potent \u03b2 2 AR-based therapeutics. In a recent study by Kolb and coworkers, over 1 million commercially available lead-like molecules were used in a docking screen with the \u03b2 2 AR. The most highly scored compounds in this screen were then tested, resulting in the discovery of six new inhibitors with binding affinities <4 \u00b5M, one with a K i of 9 nM [25] . Thus, the high-resolution \u03b2 2 AR structure represents a significant advance in the understanding and utilization of structural information for GPCR drug discovery; however, there are many other members of this receptor family whose structures remain unsolved. This situation underscores the compelling need for new strategies aimed at membrane protein crystallization.",

Using automated high-throughput methods, it is currently possible to test thousands of potential crystallization conditions by setting up and monitoring trials using sub-microliter volumes of protein solution [23, [26] [27] . This miniaturization of experiments reduces the labor burden devoted to protein expression and purification, thus enabling the evaluation of up to 10 5 crystallization trials per day [28] . This can be extremely beneficial for protein targets that are labile and/or are only available in very small quantities. Microfluidic platforms have also been used to further reduce the volumes needed down to \u2264 10 nL per crystallization condition [29] . Other strategies used include determination of the \"crystallization slot\", where osmotic second virial coefficients (B 22 ) lying in a range between \u22128 \u00d7 10 \u22124 and \u22122 \u00d7 10 \u22124 mol/g 2 are experimentally determined [30] , the \"relative crystallizability\", a parameter that describes the percentage of crystal nucleation phase area within the protein and precipitating agent concentration ranges [31] , or the crystallization coefficient (\u03be c , which is proportional to the ratio between the volume diffusion rate and the surface integration rate) to determine the \"kinetic crystallization window\" where 1 < \u03be c < 8 for crystals grown at the air-water interface [32] .",

These proteins are difficult to obtain in highly pure form due to proteolytic degradation and the presence of occult impurities, in spite of advances made to increase the yields from membrane protein expression in both pro-and eukaryotic systems [33] [34] . Membrane proteins also have a high degree of conformational flexibility that often produces misfolded states, a situation that is exacerbated by the high detergent concentrations that are used during their extraction and purification. In addition, they display complex phase diagrams that are further convoluted by the presence of detergent and endogenous membrane lipids, are highly sensitive to solution conditions (e.g., pH, salinity, temperature, etc), are difficult to concentrate under mild conditions, and typically yield crystals that are fragile due to their high water content. Figure 3 illustrates the different phase diagram zones encountered in the crystallization process. The information from this diagram can be used to drive the transition into the nucleation zone where crystal growth can occur; however, the phase diagram for most proteins is unknown. This often leads to the production of amorphous aggregates or crystalline showers instead of high quality single crystals. In addition, since most crystallization processes are batch procedures, growth of large high quality crystals is challenging because the protein concentration is constantly changing as growth ensues. Thus, the production of high quality crystals remains as the major stumbling block in the drug discovery process for membrane protein targets of SBDD.",

The lipid cubic phase forms spontaneously at 20\u00b0C within hours to weeks, occasionally requiring the addition of precipitant. An attractive feature of the cubic phase method is its capacity to retain the original phase state, even in the presence of a wide array of polar, apolar and amphiphilic additives. Caffrey and coworkers [37] [38] have developed a family of single chain lipids that enable tailoring of the cubic phase microstructure to suit the requirements of the target protein; however, in most cases, this information is not known precisely in advance.

An advantage of this approach is the ability to directly load the crystals grown within the microfluidic channels into x-ray capillaries for diffraction analysis. Crystals exceeding 50 \u00b5m in length have been grown in this manner from solutions of thaumatin, bovine liver catalase, and glucose isomerase [45] . Another microfluidics-based approach developed by Kenis and coworkers provides control over the extent and rate of protein supersaturation by varying the dimensions of the protein and evaporation chambers in a multi-well format [46] . This approach consumes less than 20 nL of material and has been successfully applied to the crystallization of bacteriorhodopsin. A similar approach developed by Ismagilov and coworkers utilizes fluorinated nitriliotriacetic acid (NTA) amphiphiles for the specific capture of histidine-tagged proteins within microfluidic channels [47] , a strategy that can be extended to other histidine-tagged proteins. Microfluidic devices present a potential problem; however, especially for solutions containing detergents and other amphiphiles for the crystallization of membrane proteins. If the surface properties of the device are not carefully controlled, surfactant molecules could be inadvertently stripped from the membrane protein dispersion, thereby altering its stability and crystallization capacity.

The authors also discovered that this seeding technique was more effective at increasing the number of sparse-matrix conditions that yield protein crystals compared to buffer additives alone. A particular challenge in this approach is that seed-induced crystallization may occur using conditions that without seed had been deemed unfavorable, suggesting that there is no clear correlation between unproductive protein solutions and good seeding conditions.

Interfacial templates and other site-specific nucleation strategies can emerge as very powerful tools for high-throughput structure determination, particularly if universal, rapid and predictable methods for controlled crystal growth can be merged with these techniques in stepwise fashion. The most verdant area for new methods development is in the creation of controlled nucleation and crystallization techniques for membrane proteins for SBDD. Unfortunately, the biochemical and colloid science challenges noted above have greatly impeded progress in this field by limiting the range of innovative new strategies that have been attempted. This is understandable on one hand, because efforts that are tightly focused on structure elucidation with a very small batch of newly-isolated functional and purified membrane protein are unlikely to be spent exploring novel techniques due to the high value of the target. Nonetheless, the slow progress in this field can be directly attributed to this overly narrow focus. Consequently, there is still a great need for the design and development of new materials and processes that embody as many of the features outlined below as possible:",

(right) Detail of the HIV-1 protease-inhibitor complex, illustrating important contacts and conformal fit between AHA599 and its protein target. This structure revealed that the binding interaction was dependent upon the homodimerization of the protein, providing insights into the design of next-generation inhibitors with enhanced binding interactions. Reliable methods for mapping the transition from the supersaturation zone (dark blue), where no further nucleation occurs, into the metastable zone (light blue), where nucleation can begin, are typically unknown for most SBDD targets. In addition to protein solution composition, physical factors such as sample temperature can influence the available phase space for crystal nucleation and growth.",
