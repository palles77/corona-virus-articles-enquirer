METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a 21-question, self-administered, structured questionnaire. All U.S. optometry school deans and state optometric association presidents were mailed a questionnaire and instructions to return it by mail on completion; 2 repeated mailings were made. Descriptive statistics were produced and differences between deans and association presidents were tested by Fisher exact test. RESULTS: The questionnaire response rate was 50% (25 returned/50 sent) for the state association presidents and 65% (11/17) for the deans. There were no statistically significant differences between the leadership groups for any survey questions. All agreed that optometrists have the skills, are ethically obligated to help, and that optometrists should receive additional training for participation in disaster response. There was general agreement that optometrists should provide first-aid, obtain medical histories, triage, maintain infection control, manage a point of distribution, prescribe medications, and counsel the ''worried well.'' Starting intravenous lines, interpreting radiographs, and suturing were less favorably supported. There was some response variability between the 2 leadership groups regarding potential sources for training. CONCLUSIONS: The overall opinion of optometry professional leadership is that with additional training, optometrists can and should provide an important reserve pool of catastrophic event responders.",

            "text": "In the event of a catastrophe, protocols carried out by mobilized personnel with relevant training should decrease morbidity and mortality. It has been proposed that these marshaled personnel may be from a nontraditional disaster responder profession. 3, 5 Optometrists have been historically involved with community service dating back more than 100 years 6 and responded to the Hurricane Katrina disaster. 7 In this tradition, optometrists, with their medical and clinical background supplemented with additional training, can serve as surge reserve personnel, e.g., they are competent in diagnosing and treating certain casualties. 8 The eye is particularly vulnerable to injury during disasters because it is exposed, easily penetrated by sharp objects, and subject to rupture or contusion from blunt trauma. 9 Eye injuries often occur in association with head trauma or multiple systemic injuries, which require expert triage and staging of care to preserve both life and sight. Airborne chemicals or smoke can cause debilitating eye pain and vision loss, which can affect both civilian victims and the ability of first responders to work. An important health care practitioner to provide emergency treatment for these disaster-associated injuries can be the optometrist, allowing other medical personnel to apply their skills and tend to other injuries. To accomplish these diagnostic and treatment tasks, it is important that optometrists are well informed of the signs and symptoms of biological agents, radiologic effects, and traumatic injuries. Thus, additional training of optometrists may enable them to be a valuable resource in disaster management when properly integrated into disaster response plans. Additionally, optometrists can serve as an element in epidemic surveillance. Severe acute respiratory syndrome, influenza, and certain biological terrorism agents can produce flulike symptoms, which commonly involve the eye. Optometrists may attend to such patients before other clinicians and, therefore, should be knowledgeable of the signs and symptoms of these infectious diseases. 8, 10 A primary barrier to optometrists participating in a disaster surge response is the scope-of-practice laws and regulations. These legal parameters of care are being modified for disasters after a 2004 conference of experts in the fields of bioethics, emergency medicine, emergency management, health administration, health law and policy, and public health 11 ; that meeting's purpose was to examine how standards of care may need to be altered in the event of a mass casualty incident. The panel emphasized that for health systems and practitioners to respond effectively to mass casualties, a number of important legal, policy, and ethical issues related to altered standards of care/scope of practice needed to be addressed.",

Approximately two thirds of each group agreed with private companies providing training, whereas twice the percentage of the state optometric association presidents (36%), compared with deans (18%), disagreed with the statement that continuing education courses from medical schools and medical societies could provide catastrophe preparedness training for optometrists. Optometry schools and associations as sources of training were highly and favorably viewed by both groups.",

In catastrophic situations, medical and public health resources may be placed under severe stress and overwhelmed by the volume of victims. The existence of a reserve, surge manpower response capacity may be a necessity for some postdisaster actions to be effective. However, there is a need for that surge personnel reserve to be familiar with disaster medicine, public health, and logistic principles and practices to positively enhance the response. Further, surge responders need to be integrated into the local disaster planning. 9 This survey was to determine the responsibility and ability of optometry professionals to serve as a competent adjunct in cases of disasters, to explore possible roles for optometrists as a manpower reserve, and to identify the most appropriate trainers for optometrists to serve as surge responders. Two limitations of the study suggest some caution in interpreting the findings. First, the nonresponders may have had very different opinions regarding the survey questions. The conservative interpretation of the findings thus applies to those presidents and deans who did take part in the survey, though the respondents were more than one half of the sample for each group, representing a substantial proportion of the leadership. Second, the small sample size may have had insufficient power to statistically test a difference, although the data in the tables support a general agreement between the 2 groups.",

It was generally agreed that additional training should be given by local, state, and federal government agencies and by optometry schools and associations. Private companies were not enthusiastically accepted as sources of additional training, and likewise medical schools and associations were not readily considered likely sources of continuing education for optometry professionals.",

[14] [15] [16] The profession should support modification of state scope-of-practice laws for disaster response and work with agencies and institutions charged with disaster response planning to incorporate optometrists into the surge response 17, 18 with several disaster response plans as possible concept development tools. In the opinion of the professional leadership, with additional focused training in medical and public health surge response roles and tasks, optometrists can be a viable reserve pool of catastrophic event responders.",
