In this paper, we built a Beijing urban passenger transport carbon model, including an economy subsystem, population subsystem, transport subsystem, and energy consumption and CO 2 emissions subsystem using System Dynamics. Furthermore, we constructed a variety of policy scenarios based on management experience in Beijing. The analysis showed that priority to the development of public transport (PDPT) could significantly increase the proportion of public transport locally and would be helpful in pursuing energy savings and emission reductions as well. Travel demand management (TDM) had a distinctive effect on energy savings and emission reductions in the short term, while technical progress (TP) was more conducive to realizing emission reduction targets. Administrative rules and regulations management (ARM) had the best overall effect of the individual policies on both energy savings and emission reductions. However, the effect of comprehensive policy (CP) was better than any of the individual policies pursued separately. Furthermore, the optimal implementation sequence of each individual policy in CP was TP-PDPT-TDM-ARM.",

More than half of the world's population currently lives in cities. What is more, their Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions accounted for more than 80% of the world's total GHG emissions (Feng et al., 2013) . In China, approximately 18% of the population lives in the 35 largest cities, but they brought in vast energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, which accounted for more than 40% (Dhakal, 2009) . Therefore, energy savings and emission reductions at the city level played a vital role in the process of fulfilling existing overall energy conservation and emission reduction targets (Chen and Chen, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012; Chun et al., 2011; Li et al., 2010) . In addition, energy consumption and CO 2 emissions from urban passenger transport played an important role at the city level; therefore, energy conservation and emission reductions in urban passenger transport became important measures by which to achieve low-carbon development goals (Litman, 2013a (Litman, , 2013b Geng et al., 2013; Chiou et al., 2013) .",

Substantially, these measures can be divided into two categories: a clean vehicles strategy, which reduces energy consumption and emissions of vehicles or other automotive devices per kilometer using related technical improvements for vehicles or fuel; and a mobility management strategy, which reduces traffic volume through a variety of measures. However, there have been many debates regarding which strategy is optimal overall. Researchers who support a clean vehicles strategy usually think that mobility management is difficult to implement because there is great uncertainty and the potential for great harm to residents' utility and the urban economy (Cox and Moore, 2011; Hartgen et al., 2011; McKinsey, 2007; Moore et al., 2010) . Others who support a mobility management strategy argue that the effect of mobility management on energy conservation and emissions reduction is more economical and efficient (TRB, 2009; USDOT, 2010; Gross et al., 2009) . The mentioned measures are not absolutely negative or positive in principle. But comprehensive energy conservation and emission reduction policy should include various mobility management policies both in developed countries and developing countries (Litman, 2013a (Litman, , 2013b . What is more, there is a high-income elasticity of demand for cars in developing countries. It means that car ownership will grow faster in the nearest future (Dargay and Gately, 1999) . Thus, the motorization of developing countries will put a strain on global efforts to cut carbon emissions from transport. At the same time, developing countries lack the financial resources and governance system for achieving low-carbon transport target. Fortunately, the mobility management strategy can help cities in developing countries on the path toward a more low-carbon future (Santos et al., 2010) . So we primarily analyze mobility management measures.",

(2014) utilized a life cycle assessment methodology to evaluate the conversion of U.S. municipal solid waste to liquid transportation fuels via gasification and Fischer-Tropsch. Contreras, et al. (2009) analyzed the change in hydrogen energy vehicles' market share in road traffic using the MAR-KAL model. Cort\u00e9s et al. (2008) developed an object-oriented simulation platform using a Java program to analyze urban traffic network energy consumption and emissions. On the whole, bottom-up methods perform economic analyses poorly, providing useful detailed descriptions of technology. These analyses generally overestimate the potential for economic progress (Nakata, 2004) . (3) Hybrid methods mainly include NEMS, POLES, PRIMES, POLES model, and so on. For example, Messner and Schrattenholzer (2000) analyzed an energy supply situation according to demand changes for different passenger and cargo transport units using an IIASA-CEC E3 model. Hickman et al. (2010) built the transport and carbon simulation model and investigated a series of potential policy packages that could reduce the emission's effect in London. Yang et al. (2009) built Long-term Evaluation of Vehicle Emissions Reduction Strategies and researched how to reach the target of reducing CO 2 emissions by 80% by 2050 in California. On the whole, hybrid methods combine the advantages of top-down and bottom-up methods. Not only are their functions more complete, but they also have a more complex structure. Therefore, they are more suitable to the simulation of complex giant systems.",

In the recent years, bus trip volumes reached their saturation point. To understand further urban residents' perceptions of buses in Beijing and to identify problems and shortcomings, we surveyed a sample population using a questionnaire via the website platform (http:// www.sojump.com/).

First, Beijing formally announced \"the interim provisions on passenger car quantity regulation of Beijing\" in December 23, 2010 (commonly known as the \"limit acquisition rule (LAR)\"). According to LAR, Beijing carried out a restraining policy on the annual incremental cars. Annual incremental car purchase credits numbered 240,000, and individual demand accounted for 88% of credits. Credits were distributed by free lottery. In addition, cars whose licenses were not native were banned when driving within the fifth ring road during peak hours to reduce the rebound effect. Second, according to \"Beijing's municipal circular of restrict traveling on weekday at peak hours\", vehicle licenses would be divided into 5 groups from April 10, 2011 to April 10, 2012, based on the last number on the license. The city then implemented regional motor vehicle restrictions during peak weekday hours. At present, the vehicle restriction policy on travel is still in practice. The Beijing municipal transportation committee said that whether they continue to implement this policy depends on the actual situation. Third, the population of Beijing reached 19.619 million in 2010. The floating population reached 7.047 million with an incremental increase of 905,000 people from the year before. The population has reached its highest record level so far. The explosive growth in population has placed huge pressure on the urban passenger transport system in Beijing. Therefore, we suggest limiting the influx of floating populations by balancing development of medium cities and small towns, gradually reducing or even cancelling special benefits obtained from Beijing's Household Registration.",

In this scenario, car is the most significant contributor to energy consumption. Similarly, the CO 2 emissions of cars also play a leading role.

In the TP scenario, the fall of total energy consumption is minimal. In the TDM scenario, the decline in total energy consumption happens earlier and is greater in the beginning.

In the ARM scenario, total energy consumption has the largest decline of all of the individual policies in the beginning and maintains a lower level of consumption continuously until 2020. Through the above different scenarios analyses, it is obvious that the ARM and TDM policies are both highly effective ways to reduce the energy consumption of urban passenger transport in the short term.

To explore the role of each individual policy in the CP, we investigated the effect of each individual policy under different conditions. According to the analysis in Section 3.2, it is obvious that there is not much difference among PDPT, TDM, TP and ARM in terms of energy savings and emission reduction. 15 In addition, Chinese government is under great pressure to reduce emissions to response to global climate change (Gan, 2003; Zhang, 2010a Zhang, , 2010b . As a result, we just discuss effects on emissions reduction from each individual policy. Specific calculation methods are shown in Table B .3 (Appendix B).",

            "text": "In Fig. 8(a) , the effect of PDPT \u00c0 (TDM\u00feTP) 16 is most significant, for China suggest a unidirectional Granger causality running from energy consumption to carbon emissions in the long run (Zhang and Cheng, 2009 ). 16 PDPT \u00c0 (TDM \u00feTP) presents the changes of emissions reduction resulting from the implement of PDPT after the former implementation of TDM and TP. Other which indicates that the effect of PDPT will be best after the implementation of TDM and TP. Comparing PDPT \u00c0 TDM, PDPT \u00c0 TP with PDPT \u00c0 ARM, we find that the PDPT scenario will be most impactful only after the implementation of TP. What is more, PDPT \u00c0 (TP\u00fe ARM) is always negative; PDPT \u00c0 (TDM\u00feARM) is also negative before 2014, while PDPT \u00c0 (TDM\u00feTP \u00fe ARM) is always positive. These conflicts illustrate that the implementation of ARM has a serious influence for the effect of PDPT. Therefore, PDPT should be implemented before ARM. In short, the best policy implementation sequence to maximize the effects of PDPT is TP-TDM-PDPT-ARM. Fig. 8(b) demonstrates that the effect of TDM \u00c0 (PDPT \u00feTP) is best, indicating that the implementation of TDM will be most effective after the implementation of PDPT and TP. Comparing TDM \u00c0 PDPT, TDM \u00c0 TP with TDM \u00c0 ARM, we reach the following conclusions: TDM will be enhanced after TP; however, the effect of TDM will be weakened after the implementation of ARM. In addition, the effect of TDM \u00c0 (PDPT \u00feTP \u00feARM) is prominent, which shows that TDM provides effective measures to solve the traffic problem at any time and should be practiced unremittingly. Therefore, the best policy implementation sequence to maximize the effects of TDM is TP-PDPT-TDM-ARM. Fig. 8(c) illustrates that the effect of TP \u00c0 (PDPT \u00feTDM) is most significant, which suggests that ARM should be implemented after TP in order for TP to be most effective. Comparing TP \u00c0 PDPT, TP \u00c0 TDM with TP \u00c0 ARM, we find that PDPT should be implemented first, then TDM, followed by ARM. To sum up, the best policy implementation sequence to maximize the effects of TP is PDPT-TDM -TP-ARM. Fig. 8(d) demonstrates that ARM should be implemented first to obtain the best effect of ARM \u00c0BAU. However, the ARM policy has a strong crowding-out effect on PDPT, TDM and TP. As a result the ARM policy should be implemented last to leave space for the effects of PDPT, TDM and TP policies. The effect of ARM \u00c0 TP is second-most prominent; thus, TP should be implemented first.",

Taking Beijing as an example, the effect of ARM on energy conservation and emission reduction is obviously very positive. However, Beijing has already changed car quotas from its original 240,000 vehicles per year to 150,000 vehicles per year in 2014, including 20,000 quotas which are set aside for new energy car. 17 There is no doubt that the energy conservation and emission reduction effect of CP is the best solution of all policies and measures analyzed here.
