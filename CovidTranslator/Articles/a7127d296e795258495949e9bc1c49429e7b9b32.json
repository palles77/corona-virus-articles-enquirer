Influenza virus infectivity was determined using a fluorescent focus assay and influenza virus nucleic acid (originating from viable and non-viable viruses) was measured using quantitative PCR. The results showed that the SKC Biosampler recovered and preserved influenza virus infectivity much better than the other samplers -the CCI, Teflon, and gelatin filters recovered only 7-22% of infectious viruses compared with the Biosampler. Total virus collection was not significantly different among the SKC Biosampler, the gelatin, and Teflon filters, but was significantly lower in the CCI. Results from this study show that a new sampler is needed for virus aerosol sampling, as commercially available samplers do not efficiently collect and conserve virus infectivity. Applications for a new sampler include studies of airborne disease transmission and bioterrorism monitoring. Design parameters for a new sampler include high collection efficiency for fine particles and liquid sampling media to preserve infectivity.",

Most of the bioaerosol samplers available are not sui for the collection of viruses (Sattar and Ijaz, 2002) . Samplers typically run for short periods of time (min), making it difficult to capture large volumes or integrate sample collection over time. Most samplers do not separate particles by size and are inefficient at collecting submicron particles. The ease with which collected particles can be removed from the collection media and their suitability for various assays are additional important factors.",

Measuring infectious virus from air samples is logistically difficult, as it requires infecting a host cell after collection. Methods such as immunoassays and PCR are logistically less rigorous but measure virus components, which may or may not be associated with infectious virus. In the field, airborne infectious viruses detected include Coxsackievirus (Couch et al., 1970) , adenovirus (Artenstein and Miller, 1966) , parainfluenza virus (Artenstein and Cadigan, 1964) , and smallpox (Thomas, 1974) . In these studies virus infectivity was determined using traditional cell culture techniques. Airborne viruses that have been detected in office environments and hospital rooms using standard PCR assays include influenza (Blachere et al., 2009) , rhinovirus (Myatt et al., 2004) , respiratory syncytial virus (Aintablian et al., 1998) , Varicella-zoster virus (Sawyer et al., 1994) , cytomegalovirus, and SARS (Booth et al., 2005) .

The four samplers were: Teflon filters, gelatin filters, the SKC Biosampler, and the compact cascade impactor (CCI). The SKC Biosampler has been used previously in bioaerosol field studies (Fabian et al., 2005; Farnsworth et al., 2006) and has a collection efficiency of 79% for particles larger than 0.3 \u00b5m and 100% for particles larger than 2 \u00b5m (Willeke et al., 1998) . The Teflon filter is over 99% efficient in capturing particles larger than 0.3 \u00b5m (Burton et al., 2007; Pall Corporation, 2007) and has been used to collect airborne rhinovirus in the field (Myatt et al., 2004) . The gelatin filter was selected because it can be completely dissolved in water, minimizing media extraction losses. The gelatin filter captures over 99.9% of T3 phages and is easy to extract via dissolution in water (Sartorius, 2007) . The CCI impactor was selected because of its novel sampling media, the polyurethane foam (PUF), whose properties include minimal particle bounce and high loading capacity (Kavouras and Koutrakis, 2001; Lee et al., 2005) . The CCI captures 100% of particles larger than 1 \u00b5m and 20% of particles <0.1 \u00b5m (Demokritou et al., 2004) .",

The chamber was housed inside a type IIA biosafety cabinet and consisted of two areas: (i) aerosol generation and drying and (ii) sampling. The first area contained a 6-jet Collison nebulizer (model CN-25, BGI; Waltham, MA, USA) running at 20 psig (Gussman, 2007; May, 1973) . The liquid in the nebulizer contained 24.75 ml PBS, 24.75 ml water, 1 ml of 10 \u22122 diluted influenza virus stock, 5 \u00b5l of antifoam A, and 0.1% BSA. Aerosols were released from the nebulizer into a diffuser and passed through baffles, which allowed for mixing and drying of the aerosol before being introduced to the sampling area. A relative humidity and temperature probe was located at the end of the drying chamber and continuously monitored environmental conditions. The second area included the four bioaerosol samplers, a magnahelix to monitor the pressure drop through the system, an air bypass, a rotameter for monitoring flowrate, and a HEPA filter equipped pump. The rotameter was calibrated against a 30 lpm Gilian Gilibrator (Sensidyne, Clearwater, FL, USA). A Medo vacuum pump (model VP0935A; Medo USA, Hanover Park, IL, USA) maintained an airflow rate of 25 or 30 lpm through the chamber depending on the sampler demand. The samplers were connected to four ports via a series of Y connectors and tubing to collect serial samples without interrupting the airflow through the chamber. All air was exhausted through the HEPA filter into the biohood.",

Preliminary aerosol detection experiments showed that nebulizer output increased linearly over time, although the change was not significantly different in the first 70 min (data not shown). We assayed the contents of the nebulizer before and after sampling to ascertain the effect to the nebulization on virus concentration and viability. The ratio of total to infectious (T/I) VPs was calculated by dividing the qPCR results by the focus assay results. The nebulizer T/I ratio of VPs to infectious foci for experiment A was 200 RNA particles/FFU at the beginning of the experiment and 240 RNA particles/FFU at the end of the experiment. In experiment B the nebulizer T/I ratio increased from 340 to 380 RNA particles/FFU. Although results indicated a slight increase in infectious and total virus nebulizer concentrations over the course of the aerosol experiment, only in the second aerosol experiment were total virus concentrations significantly higher (P < 0.05). Table 1 presents the results of the focus assay and RT-qPCR for each aerosol experiment comparing the number of infectious and total influenza virus concentrations collected by all four samplers. The average T/I ratio calculated for the viruses collected with the SKC Biosampler was similar to the T/I ratio of the nebulizer liquid, indicating that there is little or no loss of virus infectivity from the time the virus was aerosolized to when it was collected by the sampler. The average T/I ratios of the viruses measured from the CCI-PUF, gelatin filter, and Teflon filter were significantly higher than the T/I ratio of the nebulizer liquid. The last column compared the infectiousness of the virus recovered from the sampler to that observed in the nebulizer where infectiousness is the reciprocal of particles per FFU. This column shows that the SKC Biosampler and nebulizer fluid were similarly infectious, while the CCI, gelatin filter, and Teflon filter samples were less infectious than the nebulizer liquid. Figure 2 shows the infectious VP concentrations collected by all four samplers, estimated from the regression models integrating results from both aerosol experiments and relevant covariates. Infectious particle counts ranged between 34 and 550 FFU per liter of air. The SKC Biosampler had the highest recovery of infectious VPs, collecting on average 430 FFU/l air. Infectious VPs assayed from the gelatin filter, CCI impactor, and Teflon filter were 10, 7, and 22%, respectively of the number assayed from the SKC Biosampler. The differences were statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Figure 3 presents total virus concentrations collected by the four aerosol samplers estimated from the regression models integrating results from both aerosol experiments and relevant covariates. Total virus concentrations ranged between 4.4 \u00d7 10 4 and 1.6 \u00d7 10 5 RNA VPs per liter of air. Sampler efficiency followed the same order as the infectious particle collection: the SKC Biosampler had the highest total VP recovery, with an average of 1.5 \u00d7 10 5 RNA VPs per liter of air. Recovery from the gelatin filter, CCI, and Teflon filter was 63, 32, and 74%, respectively of the SKC Biosampler total, although only the CCI recovery was significantly lower than the Biosampler at the 0.05 level.",

Recovery of infectious virus from the dry media was much better in the bench top spiking experiments than in the aerosol experiments. This implies that drying of the aerosol on the dry surfaces with continued airflow, rather than an intrinsic property of the dry media, was responsible for the loss of infectiousness. These results show that, for studies where it is important to determine the infectiousness of viruses, only liquid collection media can be used. Other than in the smallpox study, which used a plate coated with sucrose, glycerol, and bovine serum albumin (Thomas, 1974) , the few field studies that have cultured infectious viruses from air samples also used water or buffer as their collection medium (Artenstein and Cadigan, 1964; Artenstein and Miller, 1966; Couch et al., 1970) . In laboratory studies airborne infectious influenza virus has been collected with personal biosamplers with virus maintenance fluid (Agranovski et al., 2004) and all-glass impingers filled with buffer (Harper, 1961; Schaffer et al., 1976) . Two recent field studies isolated influenza virus RNA from the air-from hospital rooms (Blachere et al., 2009 ) and from exhaled breath (Fabian et al., 2008) ; both studies used 'dry' media, filters and cyclones that do not conserve virus infectivity.",

Based on the collection efficiency specifications of each sampler, we expected the Biosampler to recover the lowest virus concentrations. The SKC Biosampler has a 96% collection efficiency for particles 1 \u00b5m and larger compared with the >99.99% efficiency of the CCI, gelatin, and Teflon filters for the same size particles (Demokritou et al., 2004; Pall Corporation, 2007; Sartorius, 2007; Willeke et al., 1998) . The Biosampler's efficiency declines as particle size decreases, dropping to 79% for particles of 0.3 \u00b5m diameter. However, the Collison nebulizer generates droplets with a 2 \u00b5m mass median diameter, which then dry to smaller particle sizes depending on the composition of the nebulizer liquid (Gussman, 2007; May, 1973) . VPs are so small that they do not affect particle size output of the nebulizer (Hogan et al., 2005) but the nebulizer media does. A previous study of aerosolized S. marcescens found that nebulizing the bacteria in synthetic respiratory fluid (phosphate buffered saline + 10% fetal calf serum) instead of water shifted particle sizes from 96% of collected particles in the 0.65-1.1 \u00b5m size range to 26% between 0.65 and 1.1 \u00b5m; 60% between 1.1 and 2.1 \u00b5m; and 13% between 2.1 and 3.3 \u00b5m (Lai et al., 2004) . Although influenza viruses range between 80 nm and 120 nm (Moorman, 2003) , particles generated by the nebulizer were likely larger because of the nebulizer liquid being made up of phosphate buffered saline with bovine serum albumin and Antifoam A. Based on the typical Collison nebulizer particle size output and the composition of the nebulizer liquid, it is likely that a significant fraction of the VPs generated were above 1 \u00b5m and that for this study, collection efficiencies of the samplers were comparable.",

The difference was likely because of the particle extraction efficiency. For bench top virus spike experiments virus was seeded in a liquid at the surface of the PUF and allowed to dry, then washed off and assayed. The viruses in the aerosol experiment were dried particles that were dispersed by impaction throughout the internal surfaces of the PUF. Aerosol sampling efficiency is high for the CCI, and the CCI has many attractive features for sampling in the field, including the minimal loss of particles because of particle bounce, particle size separation, and high loading capacity (Demokritou et al., 2004) but further experiments to optimize extraction methods for virus aerosols collected on PUF will be required before the CCI can be recommended for this application.",

In the aerosol experiments, recovery from the Teflon filter was not significantly less than the SKC Biosampler. The discrepancy is likely because of differences in virus binding from liquid solution to aerosols. Teflon filters bind proteins to the membrane through non-covalent hydrophobic interaction forces (verbal communication, Millipore). Our preliminary virus spike experiments showed that an aqueous solution of virus dried faster on the Teflon filter if the filter was treated first with methanol but also reduced virus recovery from 68% in untreated filters to 33% from methanol-treated filters The results from the PUF and Teflon filters highlight the importance of conducting sampler experiments using test aerosols because they can behave very differently than spiked samples on the bench top.",

These particles remain airborne for long periods of time, may carry infectious viruses, and may be responsible for airborne transmission of communicable viral diseases. To further examine the risk posed by submicron exhaled particles, it will be important to investigate whether the viral RNA present in these particles indicates the presence of infectious virus. The experiments reported here indicate that it will be essential for such investigations to collect submicron particle into liquid media.
