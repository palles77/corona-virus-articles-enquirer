This is corroborated by longitudinal data in a chimpanzee acutely infected with HBV, where serum IL-10 was readily detectable and correlated with intrahepatic CD8 + T cell infiltration and liver disease severity. Unexpectedly, mouse and human CD8 + T cellderived IL-10 was found to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to enhance IL-2 responsiveness, thus preventing antigen-induced HBV-specific effector CD8 + T cell apoptosis. Accordingly, the use of mouse models of HBV pathogenesis revealed that the IL-10 produced by effector CD8 + T cells promoted their own intrahepatic survival and, thus supported, rather than suppressed liver immunopathology.",

Most of the clinical complications related to this infection is reflected in the adaptive immune response, particularly the virus-specific effector CD8 + T cell response.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Paradoxically, during some acute viral infections (e.g. those caused by influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus and vaccinia virus), CD8 T E have been shown to produce the regulatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-10, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] in addition to pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and effector molecules. CD8 T E -derived IL-10 is generally thought to limit tissue damage, 6, 7, 11 however the net effect induced by this cytokine might depend on the pathophysiological context. 12 Whether HBV-specific CD8 T E produce IL-10 upon hepatocellular antigen (Ag) recognition and the role that this cytokine plays in liver immunopathology are currently unknown.",

Using mouse models of acute HBV pathogenesis, we confirmed that IL-10 is indeed produced by HBV-specific CD8 T E upon hepatocellular Ag recognition in vivo. To our surprise, IL-10 blockade ameliorated rather than worsened liver disease. Ex vivo analyses of HBV-specific CD8 T E isolated from the livers of HBV replication-competent transgenic mice or from the blood of acutely infected patients revealed that IL-10 acts in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to increase IL-2 responsiveness and rescue CD8 T E from Ag-induced apoptosis.",

We longitudinally analyzed the sera of a chimpanzee (A0A006) that had been inoculated with a monoclonal HBV inoculum of 10 10 GE of HBV DNA, as described. 13 Serum IL-10 was not detectable until CD8 + T cells accumulated in the liver and its appearance coincided with the onset of a necroinflammatory liver disease (Fig. 1A) , suggesting that this cytokine might have been produced by virus-specific CD8 T E upon hepatocellular Ag recognition. To test this hypothesis and to assess the role of IL-10 in liver immunopathology, we employed a well-established model of acute HBV pathogenesis, i.e. the adoptive transfer of HBV-specific CD8 + T E into HBV replication-competent transgenic mice. 14-16 Na\u00efve CD8 + T cells from HBV nucleocapsid (Cor)specific TCR transgenic mice 17 (referred to as Cor93 cells) were differentiated in vitro into bona fide CD8 T E . Upon intravenous injection of 10 7 Cor93 CD8 T E into HBV replication-competent transgenic mice, the hepatic mRNA expression of the il10 gene increased sharply, reaching peak levels at 4-8 h after T cell transfer and mirroring the kinetics of the prototypical CD8 T E -derived pro-inflammatory and antiviral cytokine gene ifng (Fig. 1B) . Accordingly, IL-10 was also detected in the serum of these mice between 4 and 8 h after T cell transfer, again echoing the IFN-c kinetics (Fig. 1C) . Consistent with the hypothesis that IL-10 is produced by CD8 T E upon hepatocellular antigen recognition, we found that Cor93 T E cells stimulated for 4 h in vitro with the cognate Cor93 peptide produced both cytokines (Fig. 1D-G;  Fig. S1 ). Finally, to unambiguously identify the cellular source of the IL-10 detected in the liver of HBV replication-competent transgenic mice upon adoptive transfer of Cor93 CD8 T E , we genetically deleted the il10 gene in HBV replication-competent recipient mice, in Cor93 CD8 T E or in both. By using this approach, we could demonstrate that the transferred CD8 T E cells are the unique source of IL-10 in this experimental setting, as il10 expression was only detected when the transferred T cells were IL10-competent, regardless of the recipient genotype (Fig. 1H) .",

Of note, anti-IL-10Ra Ab injection did not affect the total number of circulating Cor93 T E cells (data not shown), indicating that this treatment did not deplete the transferred T cells.

IL-10R blockade significantly decreased the number of total and IFN-c + intrahepatic Cor93 CD8 T E cells recovered 24 h after injection ( Fig. 2C and D) .

Indeed, the percentage of intrahepatic Cor93 CD8 T E that underwent apoptosis at 8 and 24 h after transfer was significantly increased by IL-10R blockade ( Fig. 2E; Fig. S3 ), and this was reflected by a lower disease severity ( Fig. 2F and G) .

We next set out to determine the mechanism whereby IL-10 prevents CD8 T E from dying. Since IL-10 has been proposed to enhance the growth of activated CD8 + T cells in the presence of IL-2, [19] [20] [21] we reasoned that CD8 T E -derived IL-10 might increase IL-2 responsiveness by, for instance, modulating IL-2 receptor expression. Indeed, Ag-induced IL-2Ra (CD25) upregulation on CD8 T E was lower upon IL-10R blockade, whereas the addition of exogenous recombinant IL-10 increased CD25 upregulation (Fig. 3B and Fig. S5B ). Accordingly, blocking IL-10R signaling decreased the capacity of CD8 T E to respond to IL-2 (as assessed by STAT5 phosphorylation), and IL-10 treatment increased IL-2 sensitivity ( Fig. 3C; Fig. S5C ). Finally, we explored whether the capacity of CD8 T E -derived IL-10 to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion to rescue CD8 T E from Ag-triggered apoptosis was restricted to murine CD8 T E or it extended to HBV-specific CD8 T E isolated from acutely infected patients. To this end, PBMCs from 5 HLA-A201 + patients with acute hepatitis B, in whom HBV-specific CD8 + T cells can be specifically visualized by HBV-specific dextramers 22 (Fig. S6 ), were stimulated with the cognate Cor18 peptide in the presence or absence of anti-IL-10Ra Abs or exogenous IL-10. The results mirrored those obtained with murine CD8 T E , in that IL-10R blockade increased Ag-induced apoptosis, whereas the addition of recombinant IL-10 partially rescued CD8 T E from cell death (Fig. 3D ).",
