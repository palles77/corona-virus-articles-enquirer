However, little is known on porcine IFIT2 (pIFIT2). Here, we performed molecular cloning, expression profile, and transcriptional regulation analysis of pIFIT2. pIFIT2 gene, located on chromosome 14, is composed of two exons and have a complete coding sequence of 1407 bp. The encoded polypeptide, 468 aa in length, has three tetratricopeptide repeat motifs. pIFIT2 gene was unevenly distributed in all eleven tissues studied with the most abundance in spleen. Poly(I:C) treatment notably strongly upregulated the mRNA level and promoter activity of pIFIT2 gene. Upstream sequence of 1759 bp from the start codon which was assigned +1 here has promoter activity, and deltaEF1 acts as transcription repressor through binding to sequences at position \u2212 1774 to \u2212 1764. Minimal promoter region exists within nucleotide position \u2212 162 and \u2212 126. Two adjacent interferon-stimulated response elements (ISREs) and two nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB binding sites were identified within position \u2212 310 and \u2212 126. The ISRE elements act alone and in synergy with the one closer to start codon having more strength, so do the NF-\u03baB binding sites. Synergistic effect was also found between the ISRE and NF-\u03baB binding sites. Additionally, a third ISRE element was identified within position \u2212 1661 to \u2212 1579. These findings will contribute to clarifying the antiviral effect and underlying mechanisms of pIFIT2.",

ISGs can block virus at multiple stages including modulation of viral entry into cells, translation initiation, propagation, and spread [1, 2] . Among the first ISGs to be discovered and cloned is the interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) family composed of IFIT1, 2, 3, 5, and several pseudogenes and IFIT-like genes [3] . IFIT proteins are characterized by multiple repeats of tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) helix-turn-helix motifs which are involved in numerous protein-protein interactions during various physiological and pathological process including translation initiation, cell migration, proliferation, double-stranded RNA signaling, and virus replication [4] .",

Rodentia B is the ancestor of euarchontoglires to which human being belongs, while Insectivora C/Chiroptera is the ancestor of laurasiatheria to which pig belongs. The evolution of IFIT2 gene in euarchontoglires and laurasiatheria tends to stable.

The kinetics of transcriptional induction of pIFIT2 gene in response to poly(I:C) were analyzed with pGL3-B construct. The induction was in a time-and dose-dependent manner. The best induction time was for 8-12 h and the promoter activity was dropped when the time was for 24 h (Fig. 4a) . Therefore, 12 h was used as induction time in the following experiments. The promoter activity was increased with the increasing of poly(I:C) concentration. It was induced slightly when the concentration was from 0.5 to 5 ng/ml, and sharply at a concentration of 10 ng/ ml (Fig. 4b) . At the same time, the response of endogenous pIFIT2 gene to poly(I:C) was measured with RT-qPCR method in PK-15 cells, and the similar results was obtained (Fig. 4c) . ISREI-II and NF-\u03baBI-II indicate double deletion of ISREs and NF-\u03baB binding sites, respectively, while NF-\u03baBI-II + ISREI-II indicates that two ISRE elements and two NF-\u03baB binding sites were deleted simultaneously.

This indicates that the upstream region corresponds to a functional promoter, and that a potent repressive element exists between positions \u2212 1838 and \u2212 1759. Bioinformatic analysis has revealed common consensus sequence for transcription factor deltaEF1 between positions \u2212 1838 and \u2212 1759. DeltaEF1 factor, a zinc finger protein, is implicated in the regulation of a lot of viral and cellular genes with functionally diverse roles [21, 22] . Through binding directly to the promoters, it represses transcription of epithelial splicing regulatory protein 2 [23] , E-cadherin [24] and Plakophilin 3 genes [25] , and suppresses promoter activity of chicken infectious anemia virus [26] as well. Here, we confirmed that deltaEF1 is also transcription repressor of pIFIT2 gene. Additionally, the promoter activity was strongly enhanced when the fragment was truncated from nt position \u2212 389 to \u2212 310 at the 5\u2032 end, indicating another repressor present here. No specific transcription factor binding site was predicted in the region using TFSEARCH program, while by using Alibaba 2 program, Id3 consensus sequence was identified. Id3 is a dominant-negative regulator of transcription by sequestering other TFs, thus making them unable to bind DNA [27, 28] . However, the promoter activity was not restored when the predicted motif was deleted partially or completely from construct pGL3-G (data not given). The results reveal that Id3 is not involved in the transcription of pIFIT2, and there should be other factors regulating pIFIT2 expression.",

            "text": "The ISRE is essential for IFN inducibility of ISGs. Here, we confirmed that there are two adjacent ISREs in pIFIT2, as its counterparts in human and mouse [17, 18] . These two elements act synergistically with ISREI, closer to the start codon, having more strength. Furthermore, a third functional ISRE element was identified in the upstream of pIFIT2 promoter. To our knowledge, this is not reported previously for other IFIT promoters. As we use different reporter genes to confirm the potential elements, ISREIII and ISREI-II, we cannot reveal which one is the strongest in the induction Fig. 6 Identification of major cis-acting elements of pIFIT2 promoter. \u0394 indicates that the corresponding element is deleted. IS and NF represent ISRE element and NF-\u03baB binding site, respectively. The relative luciferase activity is displayed relative to the wild-type construct, pGL3-A, pGL3-B or pGL3-G1, which was used as 100%. Data are representative of three individual experiments, each with three replicates. Each column represents the mean \u00b1 SE \u25c2 of pIFIT2. However, we assure pIFIT2 is more sensitive to poly(I:C). Here, we show that 10 ng/ml poly(I:C) can induce the expression of pIFIT2 effectively, while in a simultaneously performed experiment we found that 50 ng/ ml poly(I:C) induce activity of pIFIT5 promoter marginally (data not given), and that efficient induction of pIFIT5 need a \u00b5g/ml level of poly(I:C) concentration [29] . This may be correlated with the existence of ISREIII.",

            "text": "The role of ISRE motif in the transcriptional activation of ISGs is critical and well documented, while other transcription factors involved in regulating ISG expression remain to be clarified. NF-\u03baB, a transcription factor family including p50, p52, p65/RelA, RelB, c-Rel, and v-Rel, regulates the expression of genes involved in antiviral immune response by binding to cis-acting sites in the promoters. The induction of murine Ifit1 and Isg15 was lower by type I IFN in NF-\u03baB knock out fibroblasts than in wild-type cells, while the induction of Mx1 and Nmi was at much higher levels, indicating that NF-\u03baB plays a selective and distinct role in regulating the expression of ISGs and the induction of antiviral activity [30] . Further analysis revealed that p50 directly binds to the promoter of Mx1 gene and thereby refrains its induction [31] . We demonstrated here that NF-\u03baB binding sites play a positive role in the activation of pIFIT2, which is similar to the effects of NF-\u03baB on Ifit1 and Isg15 induction. Further experiment needs to be performed to identify which member of NF-\u03baB family binding to the cis-acting element. Nevertheless, we identified several important cisacting elements in the promoter region of pIFIT2, which will contribute to clarifying the mechanism underlying its transcriptional regulation.
