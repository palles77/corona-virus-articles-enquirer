However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms for controlling memory T cell responses remain incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated the role of respiratory macrophage (MU) in regulating CD4 T cell responses to recombinant adenovirus-based (rAd) vaccines. We demonstrated that rAd intranasal (i.n.) vaccination induced migration and accumulation of respiratory MU and circulatory monocytes in the mediastinal lymph nodes and lung parenchyma. Under the influence of respiratory MU CD4 T cells exhibited slow proliferation kinetics and an increased tendency of generating central memory, as opposed to effector memory, CD4 T cell responses in vitro and in vivo. Correspondingly, depletion of MU using clodronatecontaining liposome prior to i.n. immunization significantly enhanced CD4 T cell proliferation and increased the frequency of CD4 memory T cells in the airway lumen, demonstrating that MU initially serve as a negative regulator in limiting generation of mucosal tissue-resident memory CD4 T cells. However, clodronate-containing liposome delivery following i.n. immunization markedly reduced the frequencies of memory CD4 T cells in the airway lumen and spleen, indicating that respiratory MU and potentially circulating monocytes are critically required for maintaining long-term memory CD4 T cells. Collectively, our data demonstrate that rAd-induced mucosal CD4 T memory responses are regulated by respiratory MU and/or monocytes at multiple stages.",

However, the development of mucosal vaccines has proven to be a challenge and only a limited number of mucosal vaccines are licensed in humans [3] . It is widely established that induction of memory responses is the fundamental basis of vaccination and the development of mucosal vaccines against intracellular pathogens that rely on protective memory T cell responses requires greater understanding about molecular and cellular mechanisms in controlling vaccineinduced mucosal T cell responses.",

Furthermore, T CM cells produce low levels of effector molecules such as IFN-c and/or cytotoxic granules, but they have high proliferative capacity and are able to convert to T EM upon antigen restimulation. In contrast, T EM and T RM cells produce immediate effector molecules upon stimulation but have very poor proliferative potential [4, 9] . Compared to T CM cells that are preferentially localized in the systemic lymphoid organs, T EM and T RM cells located at mucosal sites confer immediate frontline immunity against mucosal pathogens [7, 8, 10] . Numerous factors such as the strength and duration of the T cell receptor (TCR) signal, the local inflammatory signals at the time of T cell priming, and other microenvironmental signals associated with the route and/or the immunization schedule all play a role in shaping memory T cell responses in terms of their quality, quantity and anatomic distributions [1, 4, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, most of our understanding has been obtained by studying CD8 memory T cells. CD4 and CD8 memory T cells are different in many aspects; they have different patterns of peripheral migration [12] , different proliferation potential and different longevities [13] . Therefore, additional studies are required to understand the regulation of CD4 T memory responses.",

Using a rAd-based tuberculosis vaccine, we demonstrated previously that intranasal (i.n.) immunization with rAd induces accumulation of CD4 and CD8 T RM cells in the respiratory tract for a prolonged period of time and confers protection against pulmonary Mtb challenge via both CD4-and CD8-dependent immune mechanisms [15, 20] . In contrast, intramuscular (i.m.) immunization with rAd results in a predominant CD8 T CM cell response in the systemic lymphoid organs, which only translates into a transient partial protection from secondary Mtb challenge in the lung [15, 20] . While these studies highlight the importance of mucosal immunity in mediating vaccine efficacy against mucosal pathogens, the immune mechanisms that control mucosal CD4 memory T cell responses upon i.n. immunization with rAd are still unclear.",

            "text": "Antigen presenting cells (APCs) play key roles in the induction and regulation of pulmonary immune responses. In particular, respiratory macrophages (MUs) are demonstrated to modulate respiratory immune responses via various modes of action [21] [22] [23] . For instance, respiratory MU can modulate immune responses via suppressing migration of dendritic cells (DCs) into the secondary lymphoid organs [21, 22, 24] or by promoting induction of FoxP3 regulatory T cells [25, 26] . Alternatively, respiratory MUs are demonstrated to participate in respiratory immune responses through directly transporting pathogen/antigen into the draining lymph modes (DLNs) [27, 28] . Although respiratory MUs are known to play essential roles during respiratory viral infections [29] [30] [31] , it is unclear whether respiratory MUs may modulate T cell memory responses upon rAd mucosal immunization. In this study, we specifically characterized OVA-specific CD4 T cell responses following i.n. immunization of rAd expressing OVA (AdOVA) and examined the role of respiratory MUs in controlling CD4 memory T cell responses by depleting respiratory MUs using clodronate-containing liposome. Our results indicate that respiratory MU populations have stage-dependent functional roles in shaping CD4 T memory responses. While respiratory MUs limit the early stage of CD4 T cell activation and subsequent size of mucosal memory responses, they are critically required for maintaining long-term CD4 T memory responses at both mucosal and systemic compartments.",

The antigen-specific CD4 memory T cell recall responses at 4 weeks postimmunization were examined by stimulating single cell suspensions derived from BAL, lung, or spleen with OVA 323-339 peptides. Notably, AdOVA i.n. immunization induced a mixed Th1 and Th17 immune recall profile in the BAL-and lung-derived cell cultures, but a very low level in the splenocyte cultures. In contrast, i.m. immunization induced a Th1-dominant immune response that was predominantly distributed in the spleen, but very low in the respiratory tract (Fig. 1a) . Furthermore, OVA 323-339 -specific CD4 T cells activated by i.n. but not i.m. immunization also produced high levels of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a (Fig. 1a) . Corresponding to the cytokine profile in the BAL, approximately 25% of BAL cells from i.n. immunized mice were OVA-specific DO11.10 cells. In comparison, only $1.5% of total BAL cells from i.m. immunized mice were OVA-specific DO11.10 cells and the total number of DO11.10 cells in the BAL of i.m. immunized mice was significantly reduced compared to i.n. immunized mice (Fig. 1b) . Of interest, the frequencies of DO11.10 cells in the spleen of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice were comparable despite a significantly different cytokine profile in splenocyte cultures (Fig. 1a/c) . These results are consistent with our previous studies using rAd vaccines encoding bacterial antigens [14, 15] , indicating a common phenomenon for rAd-based vaccination that different routes of immunization with rAd stimulate CD4 memory T cell responses with different quantity, quality and differential anatomic distributions.",

The fate of T cells becoming stable memory T cells may be determined during the first division of T cell activation [35, 38] . In order to understand how different routes of immunization lead to different CD4 memory T cell responses, we examined CD4 T cell proliferation, an early event of T cell activation, in the lymphoid organs of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice. Based on the characteristic CFSE dilution profile, a clear DO11.10 CD4 T cell proliferation profile in the DLNs (in the MedLN of i.n. immunized mice and in IngLN of i.m. immunized mice) was evident at days 3 and 5 post immunization (Fig. 2) . Notably, CD4 T cell proliferation kinetics induced by i.n. and i.m. immunization differed drastically at day 3 post immunization (see overlay). The frequencies of nonproliferating OVA-specific CD4 T cells in the IngLN and MedLN were $10% and $30%, respectively. Correspondingly, more DO11.10 CD4 T cells progressed to later cell cycles (cycle 4 and 5) in the IngLN of the i.m. group than that in the MedLN of i.n. immunized mice (Fig. 2a) . However, the difference in proliferation kinetics appeared to be reduced by day 5 (Fig. 2b) . As expected, no characteristic CD4 T cell proliferation was observed in the nondraining axillary LN or spleen in any immunization group at both time points. Instead, DO11.10 cells in the axillary LN and spleen exhibited distinct CFSE intensities that were indicative of either non-proliferating cells (the initial transferred DO11.10 T cells) or highly divided T cells (the disseminated DO11.10 cells from the DLNs) ( Fig. 2a/b ). Associated with the T cell proliferation kinetics in the DLNs, we observed a slow dissemination of activated CD4 T cells in the non-draining axillary LN and spleen of i.n. immunized mice compared to i.m. immunized mice. For instance, the frequencies of disseminated DO11.10 cells in the spleen of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice were 0.29% and 0.81%, respectively, at day 5 post immunization ( Fig. 2a/b) . Similarly, the frequencies of disseminated DO11.10 cells in the axillary LN were 0.32% (i.n.) versus 1.4% (i.m.) at day 5 post immunization ( Fig. 2a/b ). The frequencies of disseminated DO11.10 cells in the axillary LN and spleen of i.n. and i.m. immunized mice were comparable by day 7 post immunization (data not shown).",

While a dose-dependent KJ1-26 + T cell expansion was observed in the MedLN following i.n. immunization of AdOVA, the dose-dependent reaction was not observed in the IngLN of i.m. immunized mice (Fig. 3a/b) , which may attribute to the concurrent events of CD4 T cell proliferation and active T cell emigration. In comparison, the number of KJ1-26 + T cells in the spleen displayed a clear trend of dosedependent responses in both i.n. and i.m. immunized mice. Consistent with the proliferation profile, the overall levels of KJ1-26 + T cell expansion in the spleen of i.n. immunized mice were lower compared to i.m. immunized mice at both doses (Fig. 3c) , suggesting that the model of antigen uptake in i.n. and i.m. immunization has a role in regulating CD4 T cell responses. Remarkably, the kinetics of OVA 323-339 -specific IFN-c response in the splenocyte cultures was characteristically affected by the route of immunization (Fig. 3d) . OVA peptide stimulated a rapid IFN-c response, a typical T EM response , in i.m. immunized mice which was readily detected as early as 6 h and peaked at 12-24 h post stimulation.",

Together, our results demonstrate that the impact of route of immunization on CD4 T cell responses starts at the very beginning of the immune induction phase via controlling CD4 T cell proliferation in the local DLNs.

CD11c -F4/80 + IMs also showed inhibitory effect on CD4 T cell proliferation in lung-DC cultures although they appeared to be less inhibitory (Fig. 4e) .

As shown in Fig. 5 , the vast majority of CFSE + migrating cells in mice treated with CFSE/PBS were CD3 + and B220 + , indicating a homeostatic migration of T cells and B cells from the airway to the DLN. Remarkably, AdOVA immunization significantly increased the frequency and total number of CFSE + DCs (MHCII + CD11c + ) and MU (MHCII + CD11c + F4/80 + ) in the DLNs compared to the CFSE/PBS control group (Fig. 5a/b ). Corresponding to the changes in the DLN, AdOVA immunization significantly increased the frequency and number of AMs and DCs in the lung (Fig. 5c/d) . These results indicate that AdOVA i.n. immunization induces concurrent migration and/or expansion of respiratory DCs and MU populations in the DLNs and lung parenchyma. Notably, AMs in Ad-immunized mice displayed an increased frequency of MHC II-positive (45% in CFSE/ Ad group versus 28% in CFSE/PBS group). In addition, the F4/80 + cells observed in the lung of AdOVA-immunized mice were predominantly CFSE-negative and CD11c + (Fig. 5b) , indicating that accumulation of AMs in Ad-immunized mice is largely due to the recruitment of circulating monocyte-derived MU. Together, our results demonstrate a dynamic involvement of respiratory MU populations upon i.n. vaccination with rAd.",

By characterizing early events of CD4 T cell activation following i.n. and i.m. immunization, we have demonstrated that the differential CD4 T cell responses associated with the route of immunization are controlled by multiple factors including the model of antigen uptake and the intrinsic properties of APCs. By tracking respiratory macrophages upon i.n. immunization, we have revealed a dynamic process of respiratory macrophages induced by mucosal immunization and demonstrated that respiratory MU and circulating monocytes migrate into the local draining LNs and accumulate in the lung parenchyma. By depleting macrophages using clodronate-containing liposomes, we have further demonstrated divergent roles for respiratory MU populations in controlling CD4 T memory responses to rAd immunization in a stage-dependent manner. While respiratory MU populations act as a negative regulator to limit the early stage of CD4 T cell activation and proliferation and the quality of T cells, they are critically required for maintaining long-term memory T cells, both the tissue-resident and systemic memory CD4 T cells.",

However, pulmonary MU function poorly as professional APCs but possess immune suppressive activities to dampen the induction of adaptive immune response [21, 23, 25, 26, 40, 43] . Under resting conditions, MU-mediated immune suppression is essential in maintaining respiratory homeostasis and for preventing the induction of aberrant immune responses against inert antigens and environmental particles [43] . Upon respiratory infections, production of pro-inflammatory mediators is required for orchestrating innate immune cells such as DCs to counteract the inhibitory effect of pulmonary MUs. It has been demonstrated that MU-mediated immune suppression accounts for poor T cell responses and severe disease in mice during respiratory coronavirus infection [31] . Depletion of MU in vivo with liposome delivery results in a significant increase in pulmonary CD4 and CD8 T cell responses against influenza and coronavirus infections [30, 31] . Consistent with these reports, we have also observed immune suppressive activity of pulmonary MU in controlling the induction of CD4 T cell response and subsequent CD4 memory response during rAd i.n. immunization. Respiratory MU may simply suppress induction of T cell responses via producing soluble molecules like prostaglandins, TGF-b and IL-10 [41, 45] .",

            "text": "In sharp contrast to a negative role of MU over CD4 T cell responses upon i.n. immunization with rAd, MU-depletion after immunization markedly reduced the frequencies of CD4 memory T cells in the BAL and spleen (Fig. 7f/g) . Therefore, our study has extended our understanding for a role of respiratory MU popula-tions in maintaining long-term memory CD4 T cells. At the moment, the molecular mechanisms underlying the observation remain unclear. Recent fate-mapping studies indicate that the tissue-resident MU population is derived from the yolk sac and fetal liver during development [46, 47] , and mixed with monocyte-derived MUs recruited from the bone marrow after tissue injury and infection [48] . While the yolk-sac-derived MU population is capable of self-renewing in the steady state, its role in lung infection/immunization remains unclear. In our system, massive expansion of pulmonary MU population after rAd immunization was observed (Fig. 5c/d) . Although the vast majority of pulmonary MU population appeared to be recruited from circulating monocytes, we cannot rule of the possibility that a portion of them are proliferating yolk-sac-derived MU population. In addition, there might be an enhanced secondary monocyte recruitment in the lung following repeated clodronate-containing liposome delivery (Sup. Fig. 1 ). These monocytes are likely mobilized from the spleen as a result of heightened inflammatory responses in the lung [49] . However, investigating the precise role of these monocytes, monocyte-derived macrophages and different pulmonary MU populations in maintaining long-term CD4 memory T cells requires a more sophisticated system. Nevertheless, it has been suggested in a recent study that immune regulatory macrophages differentiated from monocytes by M-CSF and IL-34 are able to switch non-committed human CD4 memory T cells into Th17 cells [50] . Conversely, the pro-inflammatory macrophages induced by GM-CSF promote Th1 cells [50] . Furthermore, a recent study using intra-vaginal immunization with an attenuated herpes simplex virus 2 demonstrates that tissue resident CD4 memory T cells are maintained by chemokines, particularly CCL5, secreted by local macrophages [51] . Therefore, the accumulation of respiratory T EM CD4 T cells in i.n immunized mice is unlikely only controlled at the initial phase of CD4 T cell activation in the DLNs. Rather, we believe that the initial T EM CD4 T cells disseminated from the DLNs may have undergone additional expansion, modification and fitness within the respiratory microenvironment and this process is largely dependent on the presence of respiratory MU populations and the soluble mediators released by MU. Long-term memory CD8 T cells in the airway lumen by mucosal immunization with rAd undergo antigen-driven proliferation in situ [52] . Therefore, respiratory MU may maintain CD4 memory T cells via presenting antigen to activated CD4 T cells at the immunization site. Viral-infected alveolar MU are known to undergo apoptosis in order to control intracellular viral infection [34, 45] . Potentially, those apoptotic MU and cellular debris are taken up by neighboring/recruiting MU for maintaining normal respiratory function [29, 34, 45] . Under this condition, alveolar MU may acquire viral antigens through active internalization of viral-infected dying alveolar MU and present antigen to activated CD4 T cells in the airway lumen for a prolonged period of time. Further investigations are needed to delineate the involvement of respiratory MU in protecting tissue-resident CD4 memory T cells.",
