The high specificity for the recognition site makes UCHs useful enzymes for in vitro cleavage of ubiquitin fusion proteins. In this work, an active C-terminal His-tagged UCH from Drosophila melanogaster (DmUCH) was produced as a secretory form in a recombinant strain of the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. The production of recombinant DmUCH by Mut s strain was much higher than that by Mut + strain, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis. When expression was induced at pH 6.0 in a BMMY/methanol medium, the concentration of recombinant DmUCH reached 210 mg l \u00c01 . With the (His) 6 -tag, the recombinant DmUCH was easily purified by Ni-NTA chromatography and 18 mg pure active DmUCH were obtained from 100 ml culture broth supernatant. Ubiquitin-magainin fusion protein was efficiently cleaved by DmUCH, yielding recombinant magainin with high antimicrobial activity. After removing the contaminants by Ni-NTA chromatography, recombinant magainin was purified to homogeneity easily by reversed-phase HPLC. Analysis of the recombinant magainin by ESI-MS showed that the molecular weight of the purified recombinant magainin was 2465 Da, which perfectly matches the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. The result of mass spectrometry confirmed that the purified His-tagged DmUCH can recognize the ubiquitin-magainin fusion protein and cleave it at the carboxyl terminus of ubquitin precisely. Our results showed that P. pastoris is a robust system to express the secreted form of DmUCH.",

            "text": "In recent years, one strategy, which has been developed for the expression of heterologous gene in Escherichia coli, is to fuse the gene of interest downstream of the ubiquitin gene to produce a fusion protein [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Ubiquitin-based tags have been used to not only increase expression levels but also to aid in protein folding. The technology has emerged as an alternative for the production, solubility and correct folding of otherwise intractable proteins. When fused to ubiquitin, insoluble proteins fold properly and become soluble [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Furthermore, the ubiquitin tag can be removed using a group of enzymes called deubiquitinating enzymes that cleave the tail sequence following a Gly-Gly dipeptide in the ubiquitin-derived substrates [1, 13] . Deubiquitinating enzymes consist of at least two families: the UCH 2 (ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase) family [13] [14] [15] and the UBP (ubiquitin-specific processing protease) family [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . UBPs are thought to disassemble polyubiquitin chains, whereas UCHs are shown to hydrolyze bonds between small adducts and ubiquitin to generate free monomeric ubiquitin [1, 3] .",

The enzyme is particularly suitable for this role because of its high degree of specificity, its tolerance to a wide range of reaction conditions, and the fact that its recognition sequence lies entirely at the amino-terminal side of the scissile bond [12] . This enzymatic activity of the UCH allows the release of the carboxylterminal fusion partners from fusion proteins without adding any unwanted amino acid residues to their amino termini. Thus, to cater for the applications, high yields of recombinant UCHs are needed. Recombinant UCHs have been reported in E. coli [12, 21, 22] , in which a renaturation procedure is necessary. In addition, since E. coli is a prokaryotic expression system, it lacks posttranslational modifications, such as proteolytic processing, folding and glycosylation that occur in a eukaryotic system. These limitations have prompted biotechnologists to seek new expression systems.",

The cDNA encoding D. melanogaster ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase (DmUCH) (GenBank Accession No. NM_057592) was amplified using the first strand cDNA as a template and a pair of gene specific primers designed based on the nucleotide sequence of DmUCH. The gene specific primers are: PF (5 0 -CCG CTC GAG AAA AGA ATG TTA ACC TGG ACG CCA CTT G-3 0 ) and PR (5 0 -CAT GCG GCC GCT TGT TGT GCC GCG GTC AAG GCC-3 0 ). In order to express the native N-terminus of DmUCH, an XhoI restriction site was introduced to allow in-frame cloning of the gene into the a-factor secretion signal of pPICZa-A expression vector and a nucleotides sequence encoding the KEX2 cleavage site was placed ahead of DmUCH. At the C-terminus, the stop codon was eliminated and replaced with a NotI restriction site, thus, the expressed DmUCH should ligate to the 6xHis-tag at the carboxyl terminus. PCR was performed as follows: preheating at 94\u00b0C for 7 min, 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 40 s, 55\u00b0C for 40 s and 72\u00b0C for 50 s, followed by an elongation at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. A 690 bp fragment was recovered from the gel by using the E.Z.N.A Gel Extraction Kit, and cloned into a pMD18-T vector using the Original TA cloning Kit (TaKaRa, Japan). The nucleotide sequence of the DmUCH was confirmed by sequencing. The pMD18-DmUCH plasmid was digested with XhoI and NotI sequentially, and the DNA fragment was gel-purified and then cloned into the P. pastoris expression vector pPICZa-A ( Fig. 1) . The constructed vector, pPICZa-DmUCH, contains the complete DmUCH structural gene downstream the a-factor sequence, and was used to transform the competent E. coli Top10F 0 . The plasmid DNA was prepared and the insert was confirmed by sequencing.",

But the fusion partner must be removed to obtain functional peptides. This can be achieved by introducing a protease recognition site, including tobacco etch virus (Tev) protease [36] , factor Xa, or thrombin protease, in the fusion proteins [35] . However, cleavage of the fusion proteins with proteases may result in recombinant peptides with an unauthentic N-terminus [37, 38] . Furthermore, cleavage of the fusion proteins is rarely complete, which reduces the yield. In addition, proteases may nonspecifically cleave the fusion proteins. The ubiquitin and SUMO fusion proteins also require proteases to remove the tags. However, the ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs), which are members of the cysteine protease superfamily, are distinct from other proteases in that they recognize the tertiary structure of the SUMO or ubiquitin. When the target protein is fused directly to the C-terminus of SUMO or ubiquitin, removal of the SUMO or ubiquitin will not add extra residues to the N-terminus of the target protein and therefore nativelike recombinant proteins can be obtained [8, 39] . In the present study, when the ubiquitin-magainin was treated with recombinant DmUCH, accumulation of recombinant magainin was observed with the reaction times. The ESI-MS analysis showed that the molecular weight of the purified magainin was 2465 Da, which is almost identical to the mass calculated from the amino acid sequence. These results indicated that the purified recombinant DmUCH can recognize and cleave the ubiquitin-magainin fusion precisely with high activity to release the intact magainin with a native N-terminus.",

The most widely used IMAC supports are either nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resins or different chelating Sepharose matrices. Importantly, the binding specificity enables the purification of proteins under both native and denaturing conditions [41] . Now, numerous proteins and peptides have been purified using the His-tags, and several therapeutic candidates are in clinical studies [43] . His-tags have also been used for purification of proteins using the expanded bed adsorption [44, 45] . In the present study, the (His) 6 -tag has been attached to the C-terminus of DmUCH and to the N-terminus of ubiquitin-magainin fusion protein, and the fusion proteins were easily purified by Ni-NTA. The (His) 6 -tag also facilitates purification of recombinant magainin after the ubiquitin-magainin was cleaved by DmUCH for 60 min, because the fusion protein, UBI and UCH, but not the released magainin, all contain a His-tag and can be removed by Ni-NTA, and the magainin is the only peptide remained in the flow-through.",

The recombinant DmUCH was expressed at high-levels (up to 210 mg/l) in the culture medium and easily purified by a single step affinity chromatography. The recombinant DmUCH exhibited high enzymatic activity. The successful expression and purification of the active DmUCH in P. pastoris will provide the opportunity to elucidate its structure in relation to its mechanism of action and offer an enzyme source for cleavage of ubiquitin fusion proteins in near future.",
