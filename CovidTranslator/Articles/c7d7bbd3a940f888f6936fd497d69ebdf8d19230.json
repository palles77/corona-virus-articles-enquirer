            "text": "DAP-related apoptotic kinase-2 (DRAK2), a DAP kinase family member, is highly expressed in B and T lymphocytes in the human and the mouse. To determine whether DRAK2 plays a role in B cell activation and differentiation, we analyzed germinal centers (GCs) and the specific antibody response to NP in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice immunized with the thymus-dependent (TD) conjugated hapten NP 16 -CGG. In drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, spleen GCs were normal in size and morphology, but their number was reduced by as much as five-fold, as compared to their wild-type littermates. This was not due to a defect in B cell proliferation, as the BrdU uptake was comparable in DRAK2-deficient and wild-type B cells. Rather, the proportion of apoptotic GC B and T cells in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice was significantly higher than that in wild-type control mice, as shown by 7-AAD and TUNEL staining. In drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, the generation of high affinity IgG antibodies was impaired in spite of the seemingly normal somatic hypermutation (SHM) and class switch DNA recombination (CSR) machineries in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 B cells. In NP 16 -CGG-immunized drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice, T cell-intrinsic Bcl-xL transgene expression increased the number of GCs and rescued the high affinity IgG response to NP. These findings suggest a novel role for DRAK2 in regulating the GC reaction and the response to TD antigens, perhaps through increased survival of T cells and enhanced B cell positive selection. They also suggest that DRAK2-deficiency is not involved in regulating intrinsic B cell apoptosis.",

            "text": "DRAK2 belongs to the DAP (death-associated protein) kinase family of pro-apoptotic serine/threonine kinases [1] . All five members of this family (DAP kinase, DAPK2, ZIP kinase, DRAK1 and DRAK2) share a homology of the sequence restricted to their Nterminal kinase domain [2] . The C-terminal regions, however, are diverse and implicated in specific signal transduction pathways. DAP kinases are involved in both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways [3] and DRAK2 was shown to induce apoptosis upon overexpression in several human tumor-derived cell lines [4] . DAP kinases are localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus [3] ; in COS-7 (human), Caco-2 (human), NIH 3T3 (mouse) and NRK (rat) cells, DRAK2 is primarily localized in the nucleus [5] [6] [7] , and in ACL-15 (rat) cells, primarily in the cytoplasm [7] . In non-stimulated Jurkat T cells, a stably expressed DRAK2-GFP fusion protein was shown to be localized in the nucleus [5] . However, upon stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and phytohemagglutin (PHA), two signals mimicking the antigenic stimulation of T cell receptors (TCRs), DRAK2-GFP was exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm [5] , suggesting a potential regulatory mechanism for DRAK2 activities in T cells. Further, a C-terminal truncated DRAK2 mutant, which possesses an intact N-terminal kinase domain, is localized to the cytoplasm but fails to induce apoptosis in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting that the C terminus of DRAK2 is required for its nuclear localization and induction of apoptosis [5, 7] . Finally, in T cell line Jurkat, primary thymocytes as well as resting B cells, DRAK2 is autophosphorylated at Ser12 upon antigen receptor stimulation and its kinase activity is regulated by intracellular calcium mobilization [8] .",

DRAK2 has been suggested to plays a role in UV-induced apoptosis [7] and its overexpression in NIH 3T3 cells or in transgenic T cells induces apoptosis [1, 10] . However, ectopic expression of DRAK2 in NIH 3T3 cells or primary T cells using retroviral transduction did not promote apoptosis [5] . Further, DRAK2-deficient T cells showed no apparent defects in the apoptosis regulation upon stimulation in vitro with peptide-pulsed antigen presenting cells (APCs), an agonistic anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-Fas mAb, dexamethasone, staurosporine, etoposide or \u03b3-irradiation [11] . In addition, drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed resistance to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) [11] . However, DRAK2 was found to be dispensable for the T cell recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) following infection of mice with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), suggesting that the EAE resistance in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice was not due to an altered T cell trafficking in CNS [12] . Furthermore, drak2 \u2212/\u2212 memory T cells specific for MHV resulted in an accelerated clearance of MHV from the brain when transferred into MHV-infected Rag1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, suggesting an important role for DRAK2 in regulating protective immunity against viral pathogens [13] .",

GC formation is distinctive of T cell-dependent immune responses [16, 17] and the GC reaction is critical for the generation of mature immune responses involving high affinity, class-switched antibodies, and plasma cells and memory B cells [18] . The generation of B cells expressing high affinity and class-switched antibodies is achieved through three sequential steps in the GC. It starts with the activation of B cells by primed T helper (T h ) cells, resulting in rapid B cell proliferation and clonal expansion, which generate a diverse B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire for antigen through active SHM and CSR [19] . Next, B cells bearing mutated BCRs with high affinity for antigen are positively selected by follicular dentritic cells (FDC) through an antigen-dependent mechanism [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Finally, the positively selected B cells are provided a survival signals by T h cells to differentiate into plasma and memory B cells, which have the capacity to produce high affinity class-switched antibodies [26, 27] .",

To explore this possibility, we immunized mice with the TD NP 16 -CGG conjugated hapten and examined GC formation and DRAK2 expression.

To determine whether impaired GC development in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice was the result of a deficiency in B cell proliferation, we performed in vitro proliferation assays using CFSElabeled B cells that were induced to proliferate by LPS or CD154 plus IL-4 [34] . These experiments revealed comparable proliferation rates in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 and Drak2 +/+ B cells (Figure 2A , B). We also investigated B cell proliferation in vivo using BrdU incorporation in GC B cells of drak2 \u2212/\u2212 and Drak2 +/+ mice 7 days after immunization with NP 16 -CGG. drak2 \u2212/\u2212 GC B cells did not display any defect in proliferation, as BrdU uptake by these cells in vivo was comparable to that of wild-type control GC B cells ( Figure 2C ). No BrdU uptake was observed in non-immunized control mice (data not shown). Thus, the reduction in GC numbers in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice was not due to an intrinsic defect in B cell proliferation.",

Point-mutations in this region reflect the intrinsic activity of SHM, and a decreased mutation frequency in this region stems from a defective SHM machinery [29] . The analysis of iE\u03bc DNA showed that the frequency of mutations in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice was comparable to that of Drak2 +/+ mice, suggesting that SHM in DRAK2-deficient B cells was functionally normal ( Figure 4A ). To determine whether the reduction in the overall IgG1 serum levels in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice resulted from a defective CSR machinery, we performed in vitro CSR assays on splenocytes harvested from non-immunized drak2 \u2212/\u2212 and Drak2 +/+ activated in vitro with LPS and IL-4. We found that drak2 \u2212/\u2212 B cells displayed a CSR activity comparable to that of their wild-type counterparts ( Figure 4B ).

Since drak2 \u2212/\u2212 B cell proliferation was found to be normal, we hypothesized that GC B cell survival is impaired in these mice. To test this hypothesis, we harvested B cells from NP 16 -CGG immunized drak2 \u2212/\u2212 and Drak2 +/+ mice and stained them with Annexin-V for FACS analysis. drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed increased total B cell apoptosis ( Figure 5A ). We also analyzed GC B cell apoptosis by staining with PE-anti-mouse B220 mAb, FITC-PNA and 7-AAD spleen B cells from drak2 \u2212/\u2212 and Drak2 +/+ mice 10 and 14 days after NP 16 -CGG immunization. B220 + PNA hi (GC) B cells from drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed a higher degree of apoptosis than their wild-type counterparts ( Figure 5B ). To directly visualize apoptotic B cells in the GC, we stained with PE-anti-mouse B220 mAb, FITC-PNA and Texas red-TUNEL spleen sections from drak2 \u2212/\u2212 and Drak2 +/+ mice 7 days after immunization with NP 16 -CGG. TUNEL signals (red dots, indicators of apoptosis) showed that drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice displayed a three-fold increase in the GC B cell apoptosis as compared to their wild-type littermates ( Figure 5C, D) . Such an increased apoptosis was almost entirely due to apoptosis of light zone GC B cells, as suggested by their proximity to the T cell zone [49] . [17, 19, 50] . Two-photon microscopy has shown that B cells establish stable contacts with T cells in the GC during the immune response [49, 51] . Also, B and T cells have frequent encounters and T cells carry fragments of dead B cells, suggesting that T cells play a more dominant role in GC B cell selection than previously thought, and indicating that T cells are critical for B cell survival in the GC [51] . DRAK2 is highly expressed in T cells and, as we have shown above, B cells undergo increased apoptosis in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Moreover, drak2 \u2212/\u2212 T cells exhibit enhanced apoptosis in autoimmune EAE mice [12] . We hypothesized that GC T cells will also display a high rate of apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, activated T cells from drak2 \u2212/\u2212 T cells have been found to be hypersensitive to apoptosis (Ramos et al, manuscript submitted). To test our hypothesis, we harvested T cells from NP 16 -CGG immunized drak2 \u2212/\u2212 and Drak2 +/+ mice and stained them with PE-anti-CD3 mAb, FITC-PNA and APC-7-AAD. FACS analysis of these stained cells showed increased T cell apoptosis in GCs of drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice ( Figure 6A ).",

Accordingly, TUNEL analysis showed that cell apoptosis in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 tg Bcl-xL GCs was not higher than that in Drak2 +/+ tg Bcl-xL mice ( Figure 7A, B) . We then measured B cell apoptosis using Annexin-V and also found that B cells in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 tg Bcl-xL mice exhibited apoptosis to a degree not higher than that of B cells in Drak2 +/+ tg Bcl-xL mice ( Figure 7C ). To determine whether the T cell-dependent rescue of B cell apoptosis also rescued the antibody response to TD NP 16 -CGG, we analyzed total and NP 3 -binding IgM and IgG1 in mice that had been injected with NP 16 -CGG 28 days before, and boosted 21 days after the initial injection. The total IgG1 serum level in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 tg Bcl-xL mice was restored to near normal level, virtually comparable to that in Drak2 +/+ tg Bcl-xL littermates. Accordingly, enforced expression of Bcl-xL in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 GC T cells completely restored or significantly raised the level of high affinity NP 3 -binding IgG1 (Figures 3 and 8) . Thus, increased intrinsic T cell apoptosis was responsible for the lower number of GCs and GC B cells, and the defective TD antibody response in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (p > 0.05).",

Also, the mechanisms that regulate DRAK2 functions and its substrates are still to be identified. We have shown that DRAK2 is specifically expressed in the GC. We have also shown here that drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit impaired GC development.

These findings were informative, but limited, in that they did not specifically show where in the GC B cells were undergoing apoptosis.

DRAK2 expression in both cell types makes the role of this signaling molecule important during a humoral response and T and B cell interactions in the GC reaction. GC T h cells are important in stimulating B cells to undergo SHM and CSR and differentiate into memory and plasma cells, and are likely involved in B cell positive selection [17, 52] . A pathway for B cell selection in the GC would entail T cell interactions with B cells (centrocytes) via gp39 and CD40 [18, 53] . Failure of B cells to receive T h cell signals has been thought to result in their apoptosis. However, to date, there has been no conclusive evidence showing T h cell involvement in the positive selection during the GC reaction. Imaging studies using the two-photon microscopy have suggested that T cells play a major role in B cell positive selection during an immune response, a conclusion reached by observing T cells forming stable contacts with B cells [49, 51] . Our findings have provided the first indication that increased T cell apoptosis leads to an abnormal B cell apoptosis in the GC, which, in turn, would lead to a defective positive selection in a TD antibody response.",

The GC rescue in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 tg Bcl-xL mice was effective, in that it leads to the restoration of serum IgG1 level as well as the high affinity IgG1 response to NP 3 . Thus, rescue of T cells from apoptosis allowed for a restoration of positive selection of affinity matured IgG1 antibodies. In conclusion, our findings show that drak2 \u2212/\u2212 B cells are inherently normal in SHM and CSR. They also demonstrate that by allowing for T cell survival, DRAK2 is critical for fostering and supporting an optimal GC reaction and the maturation of a high affinity class switched antibody response. Finally, they suggest that T cells play an important role in GC lymphocyte selection, possibly by providing, in combination with FDCs, secondary signals that are critical in preventing B cells with high affinity BCRs from undergoing apoptosis [49, 51, [54] [55] [56] [57] .

Immunofluorescence microscopy showed expression of DRAK2 protein in GCs of Drak2 +/+ mice, but not drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice (original magnification: 200\u00d7). (B) Spleen sections from drak2 \u2212/\u2212 and Drak2 +/+ mice 14 days after NP 16 -CGG immunization were stained with FITC-PNA and PE-anti-B220 mAb, and subjected to immunofluorescence microscopy. The number of GCs (B220 + PNA hi ) was determined by counting visible GCs under the microscope. In each spleen section, the number GCs was smaller in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice than in Drak2 +/+ mice (original magnification: 40\u00d7). (C) FACS analysis of the number of B220 + PNA hi cells showed a two-fold decrease in the number of GC B cells in drak2 \u2212/\u2212 mice as compared to Drak2 +/+ mice 14 days after NP 16 -CGG immunization.

After 1, 2, 3 and 4 days of culture, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry. Peaks represent sequential halvings of CFSE fluorescence and reflect cell divisions. drak2 \u2212/\u2212 and Drak2 +/+ B cells exhibited a similar CFSE pattern, indicating B cells proliferation is not defective. (C) Cell proliferation in vivo, as analyzed by BrdU incorporated in B220 + PNA hi GC B cells from spleen of NP 16 -CGG immunized mice. Seven days after immunization, mice were injected twice with BrdU within 16 hours and sacrificed 4 hours after the second injection. Spleen cells were stained with PE-anti-mouse B220 mAb, FITC-PNA and APC-anti-BrdU mAb.
