To answer this question we searched for papers that estimated the HAO burden. There are oft quoted figures in the range of 1-10% (Wenzel et al., 1983; Haley et al., 1985; Gaynes et al, 2001) . There is also, as a rule, an inference that because the HAO incidence is small compared to endemic HAIs, the focus of surveillance programmes should be on endemic infections (Haley et al., 1985; Gaynes et al., 2001) . We reviewed these studies and will show they lack validity due to low sensitivity to detect outbreaks and because they pre-date both advanced healthcare systems and the emergence of current nosocomial pathogen challenges. The answer to the question therefore is that, as it has never been precisely measured, the actual proportion is at present unknown.",

            "text": "'Outbreaks comprise 2% (1-5%) of all nosocomial infections' Haley et al. (1985) set out to identify outbreaks of nosocomial infection in seven US community hospitals over a 12-month period 1972-1973 using a computerised algorithm. In single month periods the computer algorithm looked for clusters of patients with the same site of infection and the same pathogen. Eight outbreaks were confirmed of which five had been identified by the hospitals. Thus HAOs were found to comprise 2% of all HAI with an estimated range of 1-5% (Haley et al., 1985) . The authors note limitations with their study: the surveillance system was only 70% sensitive; the system could not detect outbreaks due to viruses and identification of small clusters might have been missed. This study also took place at a time when there was a let-up in what can be described as nosocomial infection hostilities. The early devastating outbreaks caused by sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, from which infection control as a service evolved were over (Curran, 2014a) ; and yet to materialise were the effects of meticillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile infections (CDI) and risks/infections associated with advancing medicine. The conclusion from this study is, however, still apt today. Aware of the importance of surveillance but also mindful that HAO can arise and devastate patients and the healthcare systems, the authors state: 'Thus the ideal surveillance programme should be primarily oriented toward the ongoing monitoring and prevention of endemic infections. At the same time however: \"sensitive surveillance systems should be maintained to identify [HA] outbreaks and sufficient time must be reserved to mount a sufficiently rapid and competent investigation to control them expeditiously when they occur.' (Haley et al., 1985, p. 236 ).",

This is a standard industrial quality improvement approach to the binomial outcome of infection or non-infection for each performed procedure (Benneyan, 1998a; Benneyan, 1998b) . At a national level data are examined for variations between institutions as well as within institutions, and over time. Effective quality improvement necessitates that assessments are made following the addition of each new data point, with investigations and actions taken should an indication of unnatural variation arise (Curran et al., 2002) . The responsibility for this intervention lies with the local IPCT. National SSI surveillance, which is evidently extremely useful for identifying outliers and benchmarking, is not capable of detecting HAO in real time.",

Although the PPS looks to identify HAIs by category, there is no attempt to determine if any of the HAIs are related to each other, i.e. there is no objective to detect outbreaks. One of the commonest types of HAO are caused by norovirus (Kambhampati et al., 2015) ; however, the ECDC definition for (gastroenteritis [excluding CDI]), includes a fever of >38 o C (which is not a consistent feature of norovirus gastroenteritis) and a positive sample (ECDC, 2012) p(56). There is little surprise therefore that norovirus accounted for just three (0.3%) of all identified GI pathogens (ECDC, 2013, p. 43). As an example of what HAOs are missing, one large NHS board in Scotland identified for a 23-month period a total of 2331 norovirus cases and 192 unit outbreaks (Danial et al., 2011) . One further limitation of PPS is the assessment that the burden on any given day will be roughly similar; this is untrue for winter pathogens which have HAO potential such as norovirus and influenza. No cases of influenza were identified in the ECDC's PPS report (ECDC, 2013) . For all the limitations of PPS acknowledged by ECDC the first recommendation by which surveillance is to be improved is by repeating PPS. There is a recommendation to 'support the timely detection of new epidemics with alert organisms' (ECDC, 2013, p. 111) . Overall there is limited talk of epidemics; and epidemic surveillance is not discussed. A key limitation is recognising that an estimate of HAI burden comprises much more than what is prevalent; recognition is needed of the requirements that keep HAI and HAO data low. For the first time, ECDC included three new and readily available markers of 'infection control structure and process indicators', i.e. alcohol-based hand rub consumption, single room provision and IPCNs were provided. What might have been more useful is to extract other markers, that also should be readily available, e.g. number of new alert organisms and alert conditions by unit specialty per annum and the number of unit-based outbreaks of alert organisms and alert conditions (including norovirus and influenza).",

Novel national outbreak surveillance systems are emerging. Surveillance of HAO in Germany is now mandatory and the first data have been published (Haller et al., 2014) ; in 1 year to November 2012, 578 outbreaks were reported. The authors argue that such surveillance will enable greater intelligence for further preventative work (Haller et al., 2014) . Exciting though this work is, there are two key issues with such HAO surveillance: (1) ensuring completeness of the data; and (2) potential diversion of resource, i.e. if IPCTs are redirected to counting and reporting HAOs, their capability for HAO: PPDM will be compromised. With regard to completeness of national mandatory surveillance, one team in Brazil investigated the effectiveness of their system and found that only 15/87 (17%) of HAO had been officially reported (other HAOs were identified from literature searches and conference papers) (Maciel et al., 2014) .",

Society's conceptions of security were exceeded by MRSA outbreaks by the early 2000s. The redefinition came from Sir John Reid, then Secretary of State for Health who declared in 2004: 'I expect MRSA blood stream infection rates to be halved in our hospitals by 2008' (Reid, 2004) . Outbreaks of CDI provided another such 'society exceedence'; this was not just related to the number of infections and outbreaks but also, it could be argued, to the management of the outbreaks themselves as presented in enquiry reports that were subsequently showcased by the media (Healthcare Commission, 2007) . Thus began a national focus on quarterly rates published by Health Protection Scotland (HPS) and the Health Protection Agency (HPA).",

For all the national data on the increasing MRSA and CDI in 1990s to mid-2000s, actual outbreak incidence data at this time was sparse. Even though today MRSA and CDI might not be such a ubiquitous indicator of IPC practices, politicians will be reluctant to stop or reduce monitoring / targets. A public that has had its conception of security exceeded by such pathogens is unlikely to allow it. So in addition to work on pathogens of perhaps reducing nosocomial importance (MRSA and CDI), the IPCT and national surveillance systems need to be mindful of, and working towards, detecting and preventing any new emerging pathogens from 'exceeding society's conception of safety'.",

For the efforts of all HCWs no HAI category has been eliminated -yet the list of AO/CD continues to grow.

There is always a compromise of consistency and accuracy and for epidemiology the later takes precedence.

Existing national surveillance systems provide pieces of the HAI burden jigsaw -but not the entirety of it. What this paper has identified is that current estimates of HAI burden omit that which is needed to keep HAI and HAO low. Perhaps a first step is a wider problem definition of HAI burden.

Bias arises on two fronts: infections that can be counted have a 'feature-positive effect' on the estimation HAI burden (Dobelli, 2013, ch. 95) .
