The unprecedented spread of SARS-CoV-2 owes to its high transmissibility (2) , pre-symptomatic transmission (3), and transmission by asymptomatic infections (4) . An appreciable fraction of infections are asymptomatic (5) , and many others result in mild symptoms that could be mistaken for other respiratory illnesses (6) . These factors point to a potentially large reservoir of unobserved infections (7) , especially in settings where capacity to test for SARS-CoV-2 has been limited (8) . The United States is one such country in which limited testing has been a major concern, particularly as imported cases, and now local cases, have increased over time (9) . Until February 27, testing criteria in the US were limited to close contacts of confirmed cases and those with recent travel to China (9) . This means that any local infections resulting from an unobserved imported infection would have gone unnoticed. Community transmission occurred without notice while testing was still being rolled out (10, 11) , albeit to an unknown extent.",

We informed model parameters with estimates from other countries, where available (Table 1) , and estimated values of two unknown parameters by fitting the model to data on local reported deaths in the US (18). To model importation, we simulated observed and unobserved imported infections based on the number and timing of imported cases reported in the US (19) and assumptions about the proportion of different infection outcomes (5, 20) . To model local transmission, we used a branching process model informed by estimates of the serial interval and reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 from Singapore (3). Due to aggressive containment efforts there (12) , we considered our model to be a conservative representation of community transmission in the US. To relate our model's predictions to US data on reported cases and deaths, we also simulated the timing of symptom onset (3), case reporting (18), and death (21) , for simulated infections for which those outcomes occurred.",

We used this information to estimate the probability of detecting imported symptomatic infections, \u03c1 travel , by seeding our model with imported infections, simulating local transmission, and comparing simulated and reported local deaths. Under our baseline scenario, this resulted in a median estimate of \u03c1 travel = 0.39 (95% posterior predictive interval: 0.15 -0.90). Simulating from January 1, we obtained 22,876 (95% PPI: 7,451 -53,044) local infections cumulatively in the US by March 12 (Fig. 1A) . Due to the exponential growth posited by our model, 2,958 (95% PPI: 956 -7,249) local infections were predicted to have occurred on March 12 alone (Fig. 1B) . Had we performed a simple extrapolation of reported cases and deaths based on \u03c1 travel , our estimate of cumulative local infections by March 12 would have been only 5,018 (95% PPI: 2,350 -12,445).

Although we did not fit our model to deaths on a daily basis, 85.5% of the deaths predicted by our model occurred within the same range of days over which local deaths were reported (February 29 -March 12). This indicates that, collectively, our model's assumptions about the timing of importation, local transmission, and delay between exposure and death are plausible. Deaths caused by COVID-19 often occur several weeks after exposure (22) . Thus, our baseline model predicted that there would be a median of 395 (95% PPI: 125 -948) additional deaths as a result of infections that occurred by March 12. Relative to deaths reported by then, this represents an increase by a factor of 12.2 (95% PPI: 7.03 -21.3).",

First, our results were, in some cases, sensitive to deviations from baseline assumptions (Supplementary Information Text). Although most parameter scenarios we explored resulted in similar cumulative infections, higher values of R and earlier importation resulted in estimates in excess of 100,000 (Fig. S6) . Second, our branching process model assumes exponential growth, which could be affected by social distancing (24) or the buildup of immunity (25). Neither of those factors were likely to have had much influence on local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the US before March 13, however. Third, our parameter assumptions were based on analyses of data collected outside the US. Similar information has proven useful for other pathogens though, such as Zika and Ebola in past public health emergencies (26, 27). Fourth, we did not make use of airline data to model importation (28), but future applications of our method could incorporate that type of information.",

This result, considered together with extensive pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (3, 4), suggests that the US was well past the possibility of containment by March 12. Other modeling work (16) suggests that the feasibility of containing SARS-CoV-2 is highly sensitive to the number of infections that occur prior to initiation of containment efforts. Our estimate that fewer than 20% of local symptomatic infections were detected by surveillance for much of February suggests that a crucial opportunity to limit the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on the US may have been missed. Although the number of tests administered increased in March (9) , so too did the number of infections and, consequently, the demand for testing.",

We removed SARS-CoV-2-positive individuals who were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship from our analysis, due to the fact that they were quarantined (32), leaving 153 imported cases (including one death). We first estimated the number of imported infections based on the probability that an infection would be symptomatic, the probability of an imported symptomatic infection being detected, and the probability of death among symptomatic infections (case fatality risk, CFR). The CFR and the probability that an infection is symptomatic were drawn from beta distributions with parameters given in Table 1 , with means of 2.29% and 17.9%, respectively. We jointly estimated the probability of detection of imported symptomatic infections, \u03c1 travel , and the relative offspring number of asymptomatic infections, , by running the importation and branching process models across a range of values of those parameters and calculating the probability of observing the number of reported deaths through March 12; this approach is described in more detail in the parameter calibration section below. The probability of the number of unobserved imported infections being between 0 and 20,000, along with the 152 observed cases and 1 observed death, was calculated using a multinomial distribution; the number of imported infections was then sampled from that distribution. We then smoothed the date of known imported infections with a Gaussian kernel and sampled dates of all imported infections from that distribution. As an alternative scenario, we distributed the timing of imported infections based on the timing of international incidence, with cases in China excluded after February 3, due to a ban on entrance by non-resident foreign nationals who had been to China within the past 14 days enacted on February 2. For each scenario and parameter combination, we generated 1,000 sets of imported infections.",

The number of secondary infections generated by each infection in the branching process model was drawn from a negative binomial offspring distribution with mean R and dispersion parameter k. Under our baseline scenario, we used a dispersion parameter of k = 1,000, approximating a Poisson distribution, due to a lack of estimates of k for SARS-CoV-2. Under alternative scenarios for k, we considered values of 0.15 and 0.30 to account for superspreading observed in outbreaks of SARS and MERS (33, 34) . The number of secondary infections generated by asymptomatic individuals was also drawn from a negative binomial distribution, but with mean R, where in [0,1].

Each of the 200 replicates used independent draws from the uncertainty distributions of other model parameters, so we took the average of the 200 likelihoods to obtain a single marginal likelihood for a given value of \u03c1 travel and . After calculating this marginal likelihood across a grid of values between 0 (or 0.01 for \u03c1 travel ) and 1 in increments of 0.05 for each parameter, we smoothed this marginal likelihood surface using the bicubic.grid function in the akima package in R (39) to create a gridded marginal likelihood surface with a 0.001 x 0.001 mesh. Finally, we drew samples from the posterior probability distribution of these parameters by resampling from this smoothed marginal likelihood surface, which implicitly assumed a uniform prior on the two parameters. We repeated this calibration procedure for each scenario that we explored, obtaining different estimates for \u03c1 travel and for each of our sensitivity analyses.",

Including the baseline scenario, there were a total of 18 scenarios (i.e., the baseline plus two explored values for each of seven parameters plus one additional scenario with different importation timing). For some parameter values explored in sensitivity analyses, we did not directly use literature estimates, but instead chose values which were plausible minima or maxima for that parameter; these are indicated by \"lower\" or \"higher\" in Table 1 . For the dispersion parameter, we wanted to explore a value that allowed for superspreading but that generated less overdispersion than was observed for SARS; this formed our intermediate value in the sensitivity analysis. All baseline values were taken directly from literature estimates, with the exception of reporting delay, which was calibrated as described in the branching process model section. For that parameter, we obtained the low and high scenarios by multiplying the shape parameter by 0.5 and 1.5, respectively, while keeping the rate parameter the same. In this way, the reporting delay is the sum of one, two, or three identically distributed gamma random variables in the low, baseline, and high scenarios, respectively. .

Compared to a baseline median estimate of \u03c1 travel = 0.39 (95% PPI: 0.15 -0.90) with R = 1.97, the estimate of \u03c1 travel was 0.83 (95% PPI: 0.47 -0.99) with R = 2.7 and 0.08 (95% PPI: 0.04 -0.19) with R = 1.5. For a shorter serial interval with a mean of 4.7 days, the estimate was \u03c1 travel = 0.52 (95% PPI: 0.19 -0.96), and with a longer mean serial interval of 7.5 days, the estimate was 0.06 (95% PPI: 0.03 -0.14). The estimated value of \u03c1 travel was also lower if the CFR was low (\u03c1 travel = 0.20, 95% PPI: 0.08 -0.53), compared to the scenario with a higher CFR (\u03c1 travel = 0.54, 95% PPI: 0.21 -0.96). Higher \u03c1 travel estimates correspond to fewer undetected imported infections; therefore, fewer undetected importations are required to account for the observed number of local deaths through March 12 if the CFR is high, R is high, or the serial interval is short. In addition, when we based the timing of importations on international incidence (excluding China after travel restrictions were implemented on February 3) the estimate of \u03c1 travel was 1.00 (95% PPI: 0.98 -1.00) due to the increased probability of early importations -and more time for local infections to increase -under this scenario.
