Following 60s ribosome assembly, translation continues in 3 nucleotide steps with a very high degree of accuracy, reflecting the fact that maintenance of the translational reading frame is essential for useful gene expression. Expression of the NB gene of yeast Ty retrotransposons occurs by disruption of this highly accurate translocation mechanism at levels approaching 50% (Clare et al., 1988; Wilson et al., 1986) . How is this level of \"inaccuracy\" achieved?",

They consist of 0.33 kb terminal direct repeats called \"delta\" (6) flanking a 5.3 kb internal region termed \"epsilon\" (E). Along with retroviruses of higher eukaryotes (reviewed in Varmus, 1983 ) the copia-like elements of Drosophila species (Emori et al., 1985; Mount and Rubin, 1985) , and LlMd of mice (Loeb et al., 1986) , Ty elements are members of a family of elements that replicate via an RNA intermediate. Encoded by Ty elements are two genes, NA and NB. Ty elements replicate by a retroviral-like mechanism (Boeke et al., 1985) within a virus-like particle encoded by the products of the NA gene, the analog of the retroviral gag gene (Adams et al., 1987; Garfinkel et al., 1965; Mellor et al., 1985b) . The NB gene includes sequence homologies to retroviral pal genes, which encode the reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease proteins. As with many avian and mammalian retroviral pal genes, expression of NB requires ribosomal frameshifting (Clare et al., 1988) .",

In fact, we recently showed that a 14 bp region of this overlap is necessary and sufficient to promote normal levels of ribosomal frameshifting (Clare et al., 1988) . In Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), and the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), RNA secondary structure in the form of a pseudoknot plays a critical role in the ribosomal frameshift event, presumably by causing the ribosome to stall at the site of frameshifting (Brierley et al., 1989; Jacks et al., 1987 Jacks et al., , 1988a Moore et al., 1987) . The region of frameshifting in Ty elements contains no obvious secondary structure. In addition, Ty elements lack the characteristic homopolymeric run of nucleotides (\"slippery\" sequences) at the site of frameshifting that characterizes frameshift sites of retroviruses and coronaviruses (Brierley et al., 1989; Jacks et al., 1988a) . In these systems, a simultaneous slippage of tRNAs in the A and P sites of the translating ribosome on the homopolymeric sequence results in a frameshift to the pro orpol reading frame and suppression of the gag frame termination codon. This appears not to be the case in Ty elements.",

This plasmid is present at four copies per cell (Farabaugh et al., 1989) . Oligonucleotides containing various versions of the frameshift sequence were introduced at the BamHl site of pMB25 and between the BamHl and Kpnl sites of pMB38. Transcription from the HIS4 promoter produce8 an mRNA with two overlapping genes: the 5' proximal gene derived from the first 100 nucleotides of the HIS4A gene and, in the +l reading frame, the 3'proximal gene derived from the /acZ gene of Escherichia coli. Production of the /acZ gene product, pgalactosidase, depends upon a ribosomal frameshift event in the +l direction within the sequences introduced on the oligonucleotides. The rate of frameshifting is measured by determining the ratio of 8-galactosidase activity produced from a construct requiring a +l frameshift to express /acZ to that of a construct in which the upstream and downstream genes are fused in frame. As shown below, the rate of frameshifting measured in this way is high, usually in the range of 40%; however, experimental variation in this rate occurs, both upward to the range of 80% and downward in the range of 20%. This variation results from unknown effects of the sequence context of individual constructions and slight variations in the physiology of yeast transformants. We will describe as abnormal only those transformants showing rates of frameshifting substantially lower than 20% (i.e., in the range of 2% or less).",

It is possible that the frameshift event occurs shortly before or after the 14 nucleotide sequence since neither the NA nor the TYB reading frame is limited by translational termination codons in the region of overlap. In the construction used, the first NB frame termination codon is 72 bp upstream of the overlap in HIS4A while the first NA frame termination codon is 25 bp downstream in /acZ. An oligonucleotide was synthesized that contained the 14 nucleotide frameshift sequence flanked by termination codons, upstream in the TYB reading frame and downstream in the NA reading frame (Table 7) . The oligo-nucleotide was cloned at the BamHl site of pMB25 as described in Experimental Procedures and analyzed for its ability to promote frameshifting by assaying the expression of the downstream gene, /acZ. Expression of /acZ requires a +l ribosomal frameshift within the sequence between the termination codons. Frameshifting is unaffected by the termination codons, occurring at levels of approximately 25% (data not shown). This result demonstrates that the 14 nucleotide sequence is the actual site of frameshifting.",

The remaining sequences in each oligonucleotide were flanked by termination codons to ensure that frameshifting occurs only within the sequence. The oligonucleotides were inserted into the H/SA::/acZframeshift reporter plasmid pMB25 at the Bamlil site as described in Experimental Procedures. Frameshifting in the +l direction will result in 8-galactosidase production from the /acZ gene. Table 2 shows the sequence of the deletion constructs as well as the results from each construct. Deleting the first two codons from the 3' end of the 14 nucleotide sequence (including 5 nucleotides of the 14 nucleotide sequence) has no effect on frameshifting, demonstrating that only three codons from the 14 nucleotide sequence are necessary to direct frameshifting. No other Ty-derived sequences are present, yet frameshifting is occurring at wild-type levels. Deletion of an additional codon from the 3' end or deletion of one or two codons from the 5' end results in a much lower frequency of frameshifting ( Table  2 ). All three constructs are at least 40-fold lower in expression than the plasmid retaining the first three codons of the 14 nucleotide sequence. Since no construction lacking any of the first three codons expresses significant levels of 8-galactosidase, we conclude that the first three codons of the 14 nucleotide sequence, CUU-AGG-CCA, are necessary to direct frameshifting. This does not mean that each nucleotide is necessary, since the deletions do not allow us to map effects at a resolution of less than one codon. ",

Cycle 8, which is predicted to yield His according to the RNA sequence, gave a weak signal, and no assignment was made. No other amino acid can be detected. The 14 nucleotide frameshift site has a Gln residue (rather than His) following Gly. The amino acid sequence through the 14 nucleotide site confirms the Gln residue after Gly (data not shown), supporting the notion that translation shifts to the +l reading frame by peptidyl-tRNA slippage on the CUU-Leu codon. and AGG codons. In RSV, HIV-l, MMTV, IBV, bovine leukemia virus (BLV), and the simian retrovirus type 1 (SRV-l), a simultaneous slippage of two tRNAs causes a -1 frameshift (Jacks et al., 1988a (Jacks et al., , 1988b Wilson et al., 1988) . The model requires that both the A and P sites be occupied simultaneously to accomplish the frameshift. This could be the case for Ty, yet only the simultaneous slip would be in the +l direction from CUU-AGG to UUAGGC. This would predict a protein sequence of Leu-Arg-His through the frameshift site ( Figure 38 ). Another model predicts that the ribosome encountering the AGG codon pauses because of the low availability of tRNA$&. In this state, with peptidyl-tRNA& in the P site and a vacant A site, the peptidyl-tRNA$ slips from the CUU reading frame to the UUA (+l) reading frame. This places the GGC (Gly) codon in the A site. tRNA& enters the A site and translation continues in the +l reading frame. This model predicts a protein sequence of Leu-Gly-His ( Figure 3A ).",

The data clearly support the tRNAktG slippage model. Glycine rather than arginine is incorporated after leucine, indicating that the frameshift event occurs on the CUU leucine codon. No significant amount of arginine is detected at cycle 7, ruling out a CUU-AGG simultaneous-slippage model of frameshifting. These data do not rule out simultaneous slippage on CUU and the codon immediately upstream of it; this is very unlikely since that codon is not from the Ty overlap, and can be changed at any position with no effect on frameshifting. Therefore, the most likely model is one involving slippage of a single tRNA bound to the CUU codon.",

The second codon (AGG) of the frameshift site is recognized by a low-abundance tRNA encoded by a single gene. As expected, the codon AGG is rare in yeast genes (Aota et al., 1988) . The fact that the rate of aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the ribosomal A site is proportional to its concentration (Thompson et al., 1980) has been taken to mean that codons recognized by abundant tRNAs are decoded quickly, while codons recognized by nonabundant tRNAs are decoded slowly. Recent evidence suggests that translation rate is not strictly correlated with tRNA concentration, since some nonabundant tRNAs are decoded more quickly than some much more abundant tRNAs (Bonekamp et al., 1989) . Though the rule that all low-abundance tRNAs decode slowly may not be universal, it is true that some codons are very slowly decoded. Interestingly, the tRNA&u of E. coli, which is also a rare tRNA, has a low intrinsic decoding rate (Bonekamp and Jensen, 1988) . It is possible that the very low abundance of tRNA@u is necessary to promote frameshifting by causing a translational pause analogous to the function of the nonsense codon and \"hungry\"codons in E. coli frame- shifts (Weiss et al., 1987 . If this is true, then it may be possible to modulate frameshifting by modulating the amount of the rare tRNA. In particular, increasing the in vivo concentration of the tRNA should decrease the putative pause, and thus decrease the rate of frameshifting. The gene for tRNA@u was cloned onto a frameshift reporter plasmid, pMBS&SmerWT, as described in Experimental Procedures. The copy number of this plasmid is approximately four per cell, increasing the total number of copies of the tRNA$!& gene to five per cell (including the one endogenous copy). The plasmid contains the H/S4A-9 nucleotide frameshift site-lac;! reporter gene, which normally shows 40% frameshifting (Table 3 ). The 5-fold increase in copy number of the tRNA& severely inhibited frameshifting (Table 3 ). The fact that increasing the concentration of tRNA& causes frameshifting to decrease is incompatible with any model in which the frameshift event is stimulated in part by binding of tRNA& to the ribosomal A site. Rather, tRNA& must \"act\" by being absent from the ribosome since increasing its ability to occupy the A site has a negative effect on frameshifting. We conclude that competition for the rare tRNA& induces a translational pause that is essential for the frameshift event and that frameshifting occurs when the ribosomal A site is unoccupied.",

Oligonucleotides containing CGG or UCG at the AGG position of the frameshift site were cloned into the frameshift reporter plasmid pMB38 as described in Experimental Procedures.

This suppression could be a context effect around the Ty2-917 initiation codon (in which case the sequence around the initiation codon would suppress frameshifting even if positioned far downstream within a gene), or it could be an effect of initiation itself. To test the former possibility, we synthesized an oligonucleotide encompassing a region from 15 bp upstream of the Ty2-917 AUG, through the 14 nucleotide frameshift site (which was fused at the Ty2-917 AUG), and 15 bp downstream. The oligonucleotide, when inserted between a NA917deletion 929 bp downstream of the initiation codon and the /acZ gene (in the +l reading frame), supported normal levels of frameshifting (data not shown). This suggests that proximity alone causes the suppression of frameshifting.",

Introduction of the 14 nucleotide frameshift sequence into each of the six \"proximity constructs\" allowed a measure of frameshifting into the downstream /acZ gene. As we saw with the Ty2-917 construct, placement of the CUU codon of the frameshift site three codons downstream of the HIS4 AUG in construction p2p resulted in no frameshifting (Table 6) . However, construction p3p, which places the frameshift site at a position four codons downstream, shows appreciable levels of frameshifting, with frameshifting occurring at about 70/o. Placement of the site five, six, seven, or eight codons downstream of the AUG codon showed frameshift activity at near wild-type levels. We hypothesize that the ribosome becomes competent to frameshift during the initial stages of elongation following initiation, apparently with an abrupt transition after the fourth codon of the gene.",

The ribosome binds to the 5' end of the mRNA and \"scans\" to the initiation codon, usually the first AUG codon in the message. The AUG codon acts as a starting point for translation and establishes the reading frame of the message. Disruption of the reading frame occurs only rarely during elongation, but several instances of reading frame shifts have been observed. The phages f2 and MS2 (Beremand and Blumenthal, 1979; Kastelein et al., 1982) express their lysis genes through a mechanism that involves frameshifting within the upstream coat cistron. Spontaneous readthrough of leaky frameshift mutations occurs within the 0x0 gene of yeast mitochondria (Fox and Weiss-Bummer, 1980) . The addition of a carboxy-terminal extension onto the phage T7 major coat protein also occurs by a frameshift during translation (Dunn and Studier, 1983) .

Codon 26 of the RF2 gene of E. coli is an in-frame UGA termination codon, one of two codons recognized by RF2 (Scolnick and Caskey, 1969) . The UGA codon is probably the site of an autogenous control system. Instead of prematurely terminating at the UGA codon, 50% of the ribosomes shift into the +l frame at the position of the CUU (Leu) codon immediately preceding the UGA (Craigen and Caskey, 1986; Craigen et al., 1985) . In an exhaustive study, Weiss et al. (1987 have defined the minimal requirements of frameshifting in E. coli. They find that the three things necessary for frameshifting to occur are a \"slippery run:'or repeat of several identical nucleotides in the RNA, followed immediately by a termination codon and preceded by a Shine-Dalgarno sequence (Shine and Dalgarno, 1974) a precise distance away. Constructs were made that frameshifted -2, -1, +l, +2, +5, and +6 with varying efficiency. The proposed mechanism involves binding of a tRNA in the \"slippery run.\" A translational pause, induced by the slow process of termination at the nonsense codon, allows an interaction between the Shine-Dalgarno-like sequence upstream of the frameshift site and the 16s RNA. The interaction \"pulls\" or \"pushes\" the ribosome, causing the tRNA to slip along the slippery run. Translation then continues in the new frame.",

            "text": "The mechanism of -1 frameshifting in retroviruses has been shown to involve both a specific \"slippery\" sequence and, in some cases, a conserved secondary structure. Jacks et al. (1988a) showed that three subsets of repetitive nucleotides conserved among retroviruses constitute the sites of frameshifting. Protein sequence analysis and sitedirected mutagenesis of the gag-pro fusion junction from MMTV (Jacks et al., 1987 ) HIV-1 (Jacks et al., 1988b Wilson et al., 1988) and RSV (Jacks et al., 1988a) demonstrated that the event occurs at these repetitive sequences: in MMTV at the sequence A-AAA-AAC (shown as gag frame codons), in HIV-l at the sequence U-UUU-UUA, and in RSV at the sequence A-AAU-UUA. Similar sequences from IBV, BLV, and SRV-1 can also support frameshifting (Jacks et al., 1988a) . Most retrovirus frameshift events also require a conserved pseudoknot structure located immediately downstream of all retroviral frameshift sites (Jacks et al., 1988a) , a requirement also seen in IBV frameshifting (Brierley et al., 1989) . Notably, HIV-1 does not require its pseudoknot structure for frameshifting (Jacks et al., 1988a; Wilson et al., 1988) . This pseudoknot structure may be required to induce a translational pause (Jacks et al., 1988a) . Like the translational pause in the E. coli case, the pause induced by the pseudoknot allows frameshifting to occur on the slippery sequence. Unlike E. coli, frameshifting appears to involve two tRNAs that recognize two codons of the slippery sequence in the gag reading frame. Jacks et al. (1988a) showed that the frameshift event involves a simultaneous slippage of these tRNAs in the ribosomal A and P sites. Because certain changes are allowed in the A and P site codons and because several different sites exist (see above), more than one tRNA (termed \"shifty\" tRNAs) is competent to frameshift.",

No homopolymeric string of nucleotides is necessary in the region of the frameshift event. Frameshifting requires neither a nearby termination codon nor a downstream RNA secondary structure to induce a translational pause. Previously, we showed that a 14 nucleotide sequence is necessary and sufficient to induce ribosomal frameshifting even when placed within a completely heterologous context, the HIS4 gene of yeast (Clare et al., 1988) . RNA sequencing of an mRNA containing this frameshift site demonstrated that the DNA and RNA sequences are exactly colinear, ruling out any pretranslational mechanism. In this report we show that frameshifting occurs within the 14 nucleotide sequence. Since the sequence is flanked with termination codons, upstream in the p/B reading frame and downstream in the TY4 reading frame, frameshifting is confined to occur within the window between the termination codons. Expression of the downstream lacZ gene, in the +l reading frame, is unaffected by the termination codons. We show that the frameshift event is directional and reading frame specific. Three different constructs allow translation to occur into each of the three reading frames of the frameshift site. For each construct, the /acZ gene is fused downstream in all three reading frames. This allows an assay for frameshifting from each of the reading frames in either the +l or -1 direction. Translation into the frameshift sequence in the 0, or p/A, reading frame (the normal reading frame of the frameshift site) allows wild-type levels of frameshifting in the +l direction. However, translating the +l or -1 reading frames allows no frameshifting in the +l direction, demonstrating the reading frame specificity of frameshifting. Frameshifting does not occur in the -1 direction from any of the three reading frames, indicating that frameshifting is directional.",

Modified uracil residues recognize only purines, whereas an unmodified uracil can recognize all four bases (Heckman et al., 1980; Sibler et al., 1988) ; unmodified uracil residues (and consequently, recognition of four nucleotides) is common in mitochondrial tRNAs ( Barrel1 et al., 1980; Bonitz et al., 1980; Heckman et al., 1980; Sibler et al., 1988) , where a much smaller number of tRNAs are sufficient to translate all the codons of the mitochondrial genome. This characteristic makes this tRNA an ideal candidate for a shifty tRNA, as it is a major isoacceptor for leucine (present at 48% the level of the most abundant isoacceptor, tRNAcAA, Leu * Ikemura, 1982) and satisfies wobble rules in both reading frames. The second unique characteristic of this sequence is the AGG codon. This codon is recognized by a low-abundance tRNA, tRNA$'u, a single-copy essential gene.",

Since tRNA'& is now abundant in this background, translation continues in the 0 frame and terminates immediately downstream. This suggests that a translational pause is an essential component of the frameshift event in Ty as it seems to be in other systems.

Frameshifting was completely inhibited. Similarly, placement of the site the same distance from the I-/MA initiation codon inhibits frameshifting. Addition of another codon between the initiation codon and the frameshift site restores frameshifting. This proximity effect has not been observed or examined in other systems and may be a general phenomenon. We hypothesize that translation immediately after initiation might be fundamentally different from that during the elongation phase.

An oligonucleotide, Sal-upstream (see Table 7 ) of which the 3' 20 nucleotides are complementary to the noncoding strand of the HIS4.A gene, primes synthesis of the coding strand beginning 708 nucleotides upstream of the protein coding region (Donahue et al., 1982) . Downstream, six oligonucleotides, of which the 3'20 nucleotides are complementary to the coding strand, prime synthesis of the noncoding strand at codon intervals immediately after the initiation codon. The sequences of these oligonucleotides (called 2p-7p) are listed in Table 7 . PCR reactions were done as described by the manufacturer (Cetus Corporation) on plasmid pSal1, which contains the complete HIS4 gene. The upstream oligonucleotide incorporates a Sall restriction site with the downstream oligonucleotides incorporating a BamHl site. The PCR-generated frag ments were digested with Sall and BamHl and cloned into theXhol and BamHl sites of pNoUp. Subsequently, the BamHI-Sacl laczfragment of pNoUp was replaced by either the BamHI-Sacl /acZ fragment of pMBS&SmerVvT or the BamHI-Sacl /acZ fragment from pTy1812Al225-CO (Clare et al., 1988) to incorporate the 9 bp and 14 bp frameshift sites, respectively.",

A gene for tRNA& is found immediately upstream of the LEUP gene. PCR was performed on a plasmid bearing the 2.2 kb Xhol-Sall fragment carry ing LEUP using the Sal-downstream and ENX-upstream primers (see Table 7 ). The product was a 548 bp fragment with EcoRI, Ndel, and Xhol sites at the upstream end of the tRNA fragment and a Sall site at the downstream end. Ndel-and Sallcleaved fragment was cloned into pUCl3 between the unique Ndel and Sall sites. The resulting clone lacks the unique Narl site of pUC13, but introduces a unique Narl site in the insert starting 11 bp upstream of the anticodon of tRNALgA. To construct the three codon replacements of tRNAL&, we adapted a PCR procedure in which a whole plasmid is amplified using two adjacent, divergent primers (Hemsley et al., 1989) . The Narl-opposite strand primer (Table 7) primes synthesis from the unique Narl site in the direction away from the tRNALgA anticodon. Three primers incorporating the novel anticodons, the AAG, UAG. and AAU primers (Table  3) prime synthesis from the Narl site in the opposite direction. The product is a linear form of the plasmid with Narl sites at either end carrying the novel anticodons.",
