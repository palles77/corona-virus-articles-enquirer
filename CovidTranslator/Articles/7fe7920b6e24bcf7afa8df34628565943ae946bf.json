Although cases are frequently associated with well-established predisposing factors for osteonecrosis, including corticosteroid use, hyperlipidemia, and alcohol abuse, studies have also identified protease inhibitor use and history of advanced HIV disease as risk factors in this population [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . While the pathogenesis is not well understood, it has been postulated that non-traumatic osteonecrosis develops as a result of intravascular coagulation followed by increased intraosseus venous pressure, reduced arterial flow, and hypoxic bone death. Supporting this, pro-coagulant abnormalities, both inherited and acquired, have been associated with increased risk of osteonecrosis [7, 8] . Our group had previously identified an association between positive anti-cardiolipin antibody and osteonecrosis in HIV-infected adults [6] . No differences were seen in lupus anticoagulant or protein S levels in this cohort compared with HIV-infected controls without osteonecrosis.",

Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein with both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, are elevated in HIV-infected adults relative to HIV negative controls [11] [12] [13] . CRP levels correlate with HIV disease progression independent of CD4+ T-cell count and HIV viral load [14] , and predict survival in HIV-infected individuals [13] . In this population, elevated CRP levels have been associated with traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, including tobacco use and elevated cholesterol, as well as with increased visceral adipose tissue and lipodystrophy [15, 16] . The clinical implications of an elevated CRP and the optimal utilization of CRP levels in the evaluation of HIV infected adults have not yet been established in larger clinical trials, however.",

Antiretroviral regimens were similar between the two groups. Reflecting our clinic population at the time, 40% of the osteonecrosis patients and 60% of the controls had received prior interleukin-2 therapy (p=0.05).

Linear regression using data from the osteonecrosis patients with samples available for at least two time points (n= 36) and all control patients (2 time points each), adjusted for HIV viral load at the first time-point, demonstrated that Ddimer levels rose from the pre-diagnosis to diagnosis for osteonecrosis patients, while remaining stable in the control cohort.

Compared to controls, patients who developed osteonecrosis had elevated levels of D-dimer and CRP at and after diagnosis. In osteonecrosis patients with samples available prior to diagnosis, D-dimer levels increased while CRP remained unchanged over time, whereas no significant change was noted in either biomarker in the control cohort. These data suggest that elevations in D-dimer are associated with the development of osteonecrosis. CRP elevations, however, predate the development of osteonecrosis, suggesting that at-risk patients have persistently higher levels of chronic inflammation, potentially as a result of ongoing immune activation, compared to the control cohort.",

The direct role, if any, that chronic inflammation plays in the development of osteonecrosis cannot be determined from this study.",

In 1961, Nilsson described a case of osteonecrosis of the hip associated with hypofibrinolysis [17] . Subsequently associations were described between PAI-1 levels and osteonecrosis [8, 18] .

In a recent report evaluating patients with idiopathic or corticosteroid-associated osteonecrosis, D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the latter, and tended to be higher in the former, compared to a similarly aged control group [19] . D-dimer levels were also significantly higher in Gaucher disease patients with osteonecrosis compared to those without osteonecrosis [20] . CRP levels were significantly elevated in a cohort of patients with non-traumatic osteonecrosis compared to age-and sex-matched controls [21] . However, a report of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) who subsequently developed osteonecrosis found that osteonecrosis patients differed from controls in levels of protein C, plasminogen activator inhibitor, plasminogen, and antithrombin III, but not in D-dimer levels [22] . In that study, samples were drawn after the diagnosis of osteonecrosis, and at least 6 months after treatment for SARS. [23] Osteonecrosis thus appears to be another complication of HIV infection, like cardiovascular disease, that is a consequence of ongoing immune activation and inflammation. Whether immunosuppression contributes to the risk of osteonecrosis is uncertain; while the median CD4 count was lower in the osteonecrosis group, both groups had a relatively high median CD4 count, and the majority of patients in both groups had viral loads of <50 copies/ml. Biomarkers such as D-dimer and CRP can potentially identify HIV-infected patients at increased risk of osteonecrosis and other non-opportunistic complications, who may be good candidates for assessing therapeutic strategies that focus on reducing these non-opportunistic complications. D-dimer (top panel) and CRP (bottom panel) values for HIV-infected patients with osteonecrosis and controls. Medians with interquartile ranges are presented. For osteonecrosis patients, time point \u22121 represents data from before osteonecrosis diagnosis (6 to 29 months prior to diagnosis, n=26), time point 0 is at diagnosis (+/\u2212 2 months, n=35) and time point +1 is after diagnosis (6 to 35 months after diagnosis, n=38). For control participants, time point 0 represents data from the time of negative MR imaging of the hips and time point +1 is 6 months later (n=50).
