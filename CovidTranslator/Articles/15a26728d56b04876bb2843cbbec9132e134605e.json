Sentinel devices are defined as living beings posted on a boundary from which they send signals of invisible threats. The ethnography looks at how they transform differences between ordinary lives and lives exposed, between good death and bad death, through the practices of those who feed them. In farms and labs exposed to Avian Influenza viruses, the logic of biosecurity intersects with a logic of care, blurring the distinction between self and other, friend and enemy through aesthetic judgments concerning what is a 'good death'. Metabolism and immunity are redefined when sentinels are fed to produce clear signals of the mutations of viruses.",

Live poultry markets have been identified as major sites of concentration of birds and transmission of pathogens to humans: even if influenza viruses die at cooking temperature, the contact of consumers with live poultry in markets raises concerns for food safety (Fielding, 2005) . While chilled chickens have gradually replaced live chickens as a 'modern' way of eating poultry, leading to a massive reorganization of the food chain and increasing levels of import-export interdependencies, the consumption of 'local breeds' has, by contrast, become trendy for those who appreciate 'organic food' (Keck, 2011) . The risk assessment 'Should I buy chilled or live chicken?' involves conflicting representations of what is a 'good chicken'.",

While live poultry markets are major sites of contagion from birds to humans, farms are sites of mutations for viruses from wild birds to domestic poultry (Fearnley, 2013) . How is the question 'What is a good chicken?' reframed when it is asked from the farms where Influenza viruses emerge? Avian Influenza practices are good sites to investigate questions of food safety under high industrial production, since the genetic homogeneity of animals increases the chance for emerging viruses to spread (Greger, 2006) . Following L\u00e9vi-Strauss's method of mythological transformations, I want to consider the various meanings of this paradoxical entity: 'a chicken with flu'. But rather than taking the point of view of the consumer who handles singular chickens to examine their qualities, I will take the perspective of the farmer who considers chickens as a flock to grow under increasing conditions of standardization.",

Drawing on the anthropology of human/animal relations (Viveiros de Castro, 1992; Descola, 2013; Kohn, 2013) , it is possible to ask how the pastoral care of chickens is compatible with viewing infected chickens as signs of future threats. The poultry farms that remain in Hong Kong are interesting sites to study the tension between two views of zoonotic contagion from animals to humans. On the one hand, live poultry raised on the territory are killed when Avian Influenza viruses are found in farms or markets: this follows a logic of eradication, representing chickens as commodities that must be destroyed if they threaten the value of the whole stock. On the other hand, chickens can be used as a means of detecting viruses circulating in the wild before they cause zoonotic outbreaks: this follows a logic of anticipation or preparedness, that represents Hong Kong as a 'sentinel post' where the surveillance of mutations of flu viruses in birds sends early warning signals of pandemics (Shortridge and Stuart-Harris, 1982; Shortridge et al, 2003; Keck, 2010) .",

Two forms of sentinel devices are clearly used by those who manage the risk of Avian Influenza in Hong Kong. The first are unvaccinated chickens in a farm. These are the first to die when the virus infects the flock. The other is the immunological concept of 'sentinel cells'. These cells capture the antigenic information of viruses to carry it to other cells of the immune system. At these three levels (the globe, a farm and a cell), sentinel devices express various relations between humans and animals connected by the circulation of viruses.",

'Farming Bird Flu' is an expression that has been used by environmentalists and anthropologists to describe the role of poultry farms in the emergence of influenza viruses, either through their insertion in a globalized economy of commodities, including vaccines that select resistant strains (Wallace, 2009) , or through the conflicting views of what is an animal disease, in the general framework of 'One Health' (Porter, 2013) . Specialists in animal health suggested that farmers were 'feeding viruses', which meant they were giving them living material to replicate (Greger, 2006) . I coin the expression \"feeding sentinels\", to analyse the way sentinel cells and unvaccinated chickens are cultivated by humans to expose the mutations of viruses. It invites us to look at farms and labs as 'experiments' with viruses through the cultivation of a living milieu. The term 'experiment' will need to be defined when applied to these two different spaces, as the 'experiment' is more passive in the farm and more active in the lab, but both spaces produces signs of threats that can be compared.",

How do farmers cope with the massive killing of their poultry, and what does it change in their relation to daily life and death of animals (Law and Mol, 2008) ? I want to ask if the same distinctions are relevant in labs where 'sentinel cells' are cultivated, and if they reveal more general contradictions in the process of feeding sentinels.

            "text": "This article, then, takes part to a series of works on the different sites where biosecurity measures are implemented, such as labs and farms where life is cultivated under threat of infection. These sites are considered as potential sources of pathogens because they are nodes for an intense circulation of living materials (Collier et al, 2004; Hinchliffe and Bingham, 2008; Lakoff and Collier, 2008; Lentzos and Rose, 2009; Hinchliffe, 2013) . Hannah Landecker (2007) has shown that labs can be considered as farms because they cultivate and reproduce life in ways that reveal a general circulation of signs. Particularly, Landecker has identified metabolism (conditions of ingestion and destruction) as a logic that connects the lab to other spaces of circulation of signs. Following Landecker, Caduff (2012) has proposed that the distinction between matter and information determines what can circulate between labs, in what he calls a semiotic process of iterability. I suggest to extend this analysis to farms where the life of chickens is submitted to rules of biosecurity and becomes meaningful as sending signals of viral infection. Looking at the material techniques (gloves, masks \u2026) through which farmers and scientists enter in relation with viruses on a protective mode, I investigate the metabolic process by which farms and labs produce living material and waste. These relations, I argue following Caduff, are semiotic in the sense that they involve a selection between what is meaningful and what is not in a living environment, through the work of sentinel devices. This semiotic of sentinel devices does not induce a textual analysis but an attentiveness to shifting moments in relations between humans and non-humans (Kohn, 2013) .",

Eighty thousand chickens were destroyed in a 3-km zone around the farm, as well as 10 000 in the central market of Cheung Sha Wan, where all the live poultry raised on the territory and imported from China must converge before being sent to retail markets. The sale of live poultry was suspended in Hong Kong for 21 days (Benitez and Lam, 2008) . It was the first time since February 2003 that an H5N1 virus was found on a poultry farm. In 1997, 5000 chickens had been found infected with this new virus, as well as 12 humans, among whom two-thirds consequently died of this virus. The new government of Tung-Chee Wah, under Chinese sovereignty, decided to destroy 1.5 million chickens in November 1997. In 2008, Hong Kong health authorities feared that this new virus would spread from person to person, and then to the rest of the world, as it had been the case in 2003 for the SARS coronavirus (Abraham, 2007) . They imposed measures of biosecurity on poultry farms and retail markets, such as cleaning and quarantine, the most spectacular being the massive killing of 90 000 chickens. The decrease in the number of chickens destroyed was due to the decrease of live poultry raised or imported on the territory. Since these measures of eradication had been decided, no human case of Avian Influenza had been found in Hong Kong.",

However, the meaning of death becomes more complex in the inquiries by experts on the cause of the outbreak. A team of scientists was sent to the farm in Yuen Long, led by Kwok Yung Yuen. As the head of the Department of Microbiology of Hong Kong University and of expert committees on food safety and zoonoses at the Hong Kong government, he was defending biosecurity measures on poultry farms in the public space (Woo et al, 2006) . Among the 200 chickens who died of H5N1, half were 'sentinel birds', that had not received vaccines and were posted in a cage at the entrance of the farm, and the other half were layer hens that had been vaccinated. The mention of 'sentinel birds' in the press drew a distinction between two ways of dying. The Chinese word is shaobingji (chickens whistling like soldiers), which points to their situation on a battlefront between humans and viruses. Sentinel birds send signals while dying, shifting from a 'thanatopolitics' that builds immunity through the massive eradication of birds (Esposito, 2007) , to a biopolitics, more attentive to immunological differences between birds and to their relations to humans.",

They can seroconvert asymptomatically to pathogens, such as chickens for Westnile Virus. They must be taken care of to make sure that they are not infected by other pathogens than the ones for which they are the first detection line. H5N1, however, is highly pathogenic for chickens and destroys their digestive tracknot the lower respiratory track, as in humans. Chickens infected with H5N1 are described by pathologists as having internal organs like a bloody pulp (Greger, 2006, p. 35) . For sentinel birds, it is a dirty death; but for humans who posted them, it is a clear signal. This is why sentinel chickens can be raised with other chickens for production: even if their death is extraordinary, the rest of their life has been 'normal'.",

Yuen, the vaccine bought from Holland was obsolete in regard to the new mutations of the virus: this hypothesis obliged Hong Kong farmers to buy a vaccine in China where the most recent strains of the virus had developed. Hong Kong media raised an hypothesis less favourable to China: the virus had been brought on eggs hatched on the other side of the border and imported to Hong Kong at one day of age, which obliged the government to reinforce the controls at the border. A third hypothesis brought a consensus: the virus had been carried by sparrows who had passed through the string nets above the farm which led experts to recommend that the farmer replace the string nets by iron nets. This hypothesis was highly improbable, since no sparrow had been found with H5N1, but it cast the blame on wild birds to explain the uncertainties of the flu virus mutations. In these three hypotheses, the whole farm could be considered as a sentinel device, since it was posted on the frontier with China where flu viruses are supposed to circulate among wild and domestic birds. The distinction between sentinel bird and normal chicken, which was so important for the farmer at the time of the outbreak, tended to be blurred in the experts' investigation. Was it equally blurred in the daily life of farm production?",

This trade union had been founded in 1949 with 145 farms breeding around one thousand chickens. After the government issued a Voluntary Surrender Scheme after 1997 to encourage farmers to retire, there were only 30 farms, raising around 10 000 chickens each (Liu, 2008) . The military vocabulary of 'surrender' is reminiscent of the communist discourse of the war against natural enemies, that was also used in mainland China and in Vietnam (Shapiro, 2002; Gu\u00e9nel and Klingberg, 2010; Porter, 2013) . I was intrigued, however, by another term that sounded like military propaganda, but turned out to have a distinctive Hong Kong meaning. Wang Yichuan was described by the media as running a 'model farm' (mofan nonchang). Did this mean that it was exemplary of biosecurity measures, particularly clean and hygienic? As I was to discover, the farm was rather old, the ponds to clean truck wheels and boots were not used; the door was made of corrugated iron, as were the roofs. The government had sent iron nets to isolate the farm from wild birds, but they were still stored in rolls, and sparrows were flying freely among poultry. Neither was surveillance of diseases particularly active: Wang Yichuan complained that the government took one year to send them the results of samples taken in the farm, and did not provide vaccines in exchange for the samples. If his farm was a 'model', it was because he communicated with the media in a transparent way (touming), giving press conferences and not hiding the cases. While poultry farmers like to spread rumours, \"adding salt and vinegar\", he said, Wang Yichuan was proud to speak in a straightforward way.",

The solidarity between poultry farmers faced with the outbreak had not been high, Wang said, as he did not receive much help in cleaning the farm. Most farmers explained the fear of Avian Influenza by the conditions of life in Hong Kong, which they ironically compared to the stressful life of chickens. \"Nobody in the world has reacted like the government of Hong Kong, one of them said. All living beings have diseases. Chickens die but they don't necessarily have a virus. In Hong Kong, people are stressed because they live in concentrated buildings, like chickens in a cage\". The semiotics of sentinel was interpreted as a collective anxiety, producing diseases that had nothing to do with viral mutations, for which natural immunity was deemed sufficient, and more with social conditions of living, for which political protection was asked. Yuen Long, a village developed into a New Town through the construction of public housing estates in the last 20 years, had grown to half a million inhabitants, and had high rates of immigration, unemployment and suicide. It was known as the \"town of sadness\" (Chung, 2007) . In the discourse of farmers, the notion of sentinel tended to take a metaphoric meaning for other kinds of social problems.",

Striffler (2005, p. 123) , who did fieldwork in a poultry slaughterhouse in New Mexico, notes that the migrant workers felt humiliated when their controller brought them Chicken McNuggets. To emphasize the rupture with ordinary meals, I had brought a bottle of red wine, which my co-workers considered with perplexity. They finally drank it in their bowl with the chicken as a kind of soup at the end of the dinner. I later realized Chinese wine (maotai) looks white and can be cooked with chicken, while red wine looked like blood to them. Drinking wine with chickens may have reminded them that chickens had to be killed to be eaten, while the procedure of cooking avoided that representation. The sharing of wine was a revelatory sign of the conditions that made this shared event possible: the killing of chickens for food production (L\u00e9vi-Strauss, 1969) .",

Mice in contact with endocrine disruptors through plastic tools in the lab are good signals of the threats of industrial conditions of life, as wild birds situated at the end of a trophic chain in the Great Lakes. If the lab can be considered as a metabolic system, with its high levels of life production and waste, a new conception of metabolism appears with the molecularization of life. \"Food is one set of signals about the state of the world the body will grow to occupy. (\u2026) Food is not just broken down in the laboratory but can actually influence the construction and function of the laboratory itself\" (Landecker, 2011, p. 174) . Following this view, we might ask: how are sentinel devices grown in a lab in such a way as to send meaningful signals? Feeding a cell in a lab aims at changing its interaction with viruses, making clearer the signals it sends between a good death and a bad death.

For a year, I had followed the lab meetings and conferences where microbiologists exchanged ideas on how to track interactions between viruses and cells, by combining virology, immunology and cell imaging. They talked about biosafety measures in the lab and the need to keep 'fresh' cells to have clear Feeding sentinels experiments.

Labs have been classified by the Center for Disease Controls in different levels of biosafety depending on the behaviour of the viruses they manipulate. The highest level (4), provided for the most dangerous viruses like Ebola or smallpox, requires costly equipment: positive pressure personal suit, multiple showers, vacuum room, ultraviolet room \u2026 Hong Kong University was equipped after the SARS crisis with a Biosafety-Level 3 lab that allows its scientists to work on Avian Flu viruses in live animals (chickens and ferrets)but I was not permitted to enter it. Neither do the researchers of the Pasteur Centre have direct access to it, although they can ask for confirmation of their results. The Pasteur Centre has a Biosafety-Level 2 lab that works on 'virus pseudo-particles', produced by the injection of the RNA of the virus under study into the backbone of the AIDS virus. Researchers can thus study the entrance and the release of the virus in the cell without risking infection, and formulate hypotheses that can be confirmed with the live virus, thus saving time and money (Nefkens et al, 2007) . Bypassing the costs of heavy biosecurity measures, viral particles provide information on what happens at the cell membrane, without saying much about their complicated trajectories thereafter.",

Researchers must prepare their experimentation in advance to maximize the time they spend inside the lab. A schedule posted at the entrance divides the time of occupation. This division of labour brings the lab closer to a farm: researchers are not there to discuss ideas, but to produce data under tight constraints, and much of the following discussion bears on what is a meaningful data. To enter the room, Jean goes through a decontamination area, where he takes a plastic suit, plastic cap, glasses and two pairs of gloves. To wear protective equipment over his shoes, he must keep one foot on one side of a yellow line, while the other crosses the line with its plastic bag. The yellow line materializes the border between ordinary lab activity and this special moment of the experiment. The pressure within the lab is lower than outside the lab, which may explain why researchers do not feel embarrassed with this heavy equipment. A second level of security is brought by the air flow inside the four experimental hoods: it is forbidden to draw the hand over this air flow, unless microbes are brought inside the hood. \"You must imagine that viruses are everywhere\", says Jean to explain these rigorous measures. This imaginary enactment is constitutive of the logic of biosecurity: in a lab as in a farm, viral outbreaks can occur at any time, and those who manipulate them must be prepared to face these events (Lakoff and Collier, 2008) .",

The goal of biosecurity measures, Jean says, is not so much to protect the scientist as to protect the experiment itself. This reversal, which prioritizes the production of meaningful data, has a set of consequences in lab practices. Jean describes the culture in which viruses replicate, composed of glucides, as \"very nourishing\" for the cells. These are monkey kidney epithelial cells, also called MDCK cells, that have been stored in the fridge to synchronize their development during the experiment. This technique, discovered in the 1950's, \"abolished time and space\" in the labs, and was applied to artificial insemination in farms (Landecker, 2007, p. 157) . Cells must be 'fresh' to replicate the virus in a meaningful way; 'older' cells do not communicate as well with other cells. After 20 infections, cells are considered as 'old' and must be trashed. Cells are also fed with calf serum, CO2 and a liquid called PBS that avoids 'osmotic shock' when they are taken out of their recipient. The hood where the experiment takes place is thus surrounded with fridges and bottles of gas that provides cells with food to keep the experiment going.",

The stress here does not come from the lethality of the virus but from the need to produce a meaningful result. First, cells are situated at the bottom of the experiment, while viruses are 'supernatant': then, when the infection takes place, cells converge with each other and most of them are destroyed. Jean describes this phenomenon as overcrowding, and takes the perspective of infected cells: 'hey girls, we don't have room any more, we'll have to eliminate ourselves!' This reminds me what poultry farmers said on Hong Kong citizens. An infected cell acts as a sentinel chicken when it reveals the 'social' conditions of overcrowding in a living habitat.",

She describes cells as both gene factories and integrated systems, and insists on the necessity to \"grow\" or \"breed\" cells to understand their mechanisms. Virologists working on Avian Flu are transposing this method to animal cells. Considering virus-host interactions as processes of growth avoids the representation of viruses as enemies, and Jean reminds me that the first virus was studied on a tobacco plant (Creager, 2002) .

There is a striking contrast between the attentiveness to conditions of viral replication in the cells, and this imaginary enactment of a lab filled with viruses, that justifies a constant production of waste. Two views of the lab as a metabolic process can be contrasted: metabolism as the production of material and waste (the bad death of tools potentially touched by viruses) and metabolism as a semiotic process by which cells eat viruses (the good death of cells to produce a meaningful result).

Death signals the quality of the living process, whether it induces a nice signal or a catastrophic destruction.

Jean talks to me about a hypothesis, comparing the relation between the cell and the virus with that between the mother and the embryo. Following this hypothesis, being fed by cells is one of the ways found by viruses in evolution to reproduce themselves. This hypothesis explains that non-coding DNA is conserved as a trace of these past infections and as a reserve for future interactions, and that the mother does not reject the embryo during pregnancy (Forterre and Prangishvili, 2009) . This corresponds to a major shift in immunology: the immune response is not a way to protect the self against an enemy, but a process of risky information at the limits of the self. \"A cure becomes possible because, rather than suppressing immune responses, we reshape them by encouraging and feeding novel viral information\" (Napier, 2012, p. 133) . If viruses are constantly inventing new ways of being fed, our diseases signal a transition in these modes of nourishment. The logic of care, such as that of Yuren in the management of domesticated poultry, or that of Jean in the cultivation of lung cells in a lab, is a way to make these transitions meaningful, rather than following the all-or-nothing logic of biosecurity.",

The use of sentinel devices, which is one of the techniques to prepare for future catastrophes, opens new spaces for an ethnography of relations between humans and non-humans. The material presented in this article gives more detailed information on what it means for farmers and biologists in Hong Kong to be part of a sentinel post for Avian Influenza, based on daily practices of producing life. It therefore contributes to the literature on biosecurity in two ways.",

Taking feeding as a relation to a living milieu, it compares the metabolic system of producing life and waste in a farm and a lab. The life of a chicken potentially infected with flu follows the same ambivalences as the life of an experimentally infected cell, between commodity and sign, between storage and exchange. The anthropology of human-animal relationships sheds light on important issues about the living beings that are fed in such a way that they become infectious. Infection is the starting point of a reflection on human-animal relationships that is strongly human-centered.",

Poultry farmers cultivating sentinel chickens are faced with the contrast between a 'good death', that signals a boundary between infected and non-infected, and a 'bad death', that blurs the boundary and destroys the value of the stock. In the same way, sentinel cells cultivated in the lab can go through a good death if it provides a clean image of the life of the virus, or a bad death if it is unproperly cultivated and produces waste without information. The logic of care, by being attentive to the differences made by viruses in a living environment, sheds light on the distinction between a good death and a bad death.",

The ethnography sheds light on the complex logics of signalling: sentinels can be lured by pathogens, sacrificed for public health, become the objects of rumours among farmers and of controversies among experts. The question of waste, that is, of signals that have no value, runs through the ethnography, and justifies the comparison between feeding practices in farms and labs. In living systems that produce so much waste, what is the value of a clear signal?",

Farms and labs have been compared as two spaces where sentinels are fed, which means that they are systems of production of value and waste as well as systems of protection against a threat. The correspondence between these two systems of signs comes from their common reflexivity on the relations they maintain. Farms and labs can be compared as complex systems of signs where the representation of life as a value is at stake in the daily management of alimentary uncertainties.",
