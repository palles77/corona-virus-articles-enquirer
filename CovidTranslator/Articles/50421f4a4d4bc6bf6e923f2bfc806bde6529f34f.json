FT data mining is more suitable for extracting interesting information from real-world data that may be polluted by noise. In particular, the increasing amount of today's biological databases requires such a data mining technique to mine important data, e.g., motifs. In this paper, we propose the concept of proportional FT mining of frequent patterns. The number of tolerable faults in a proportional FT pattern is proportional to the length of the pattern. Two algorithms are designed for solving this problem. The first algorithm, named FT-BottomUp, applies an FT-Apriori heuristic and finds all FT patterns with any number of faults. The second algorithm, FT-LevelWise, divides all FT patterns into several groups according to the number of tolerable faults, and mines the content patterns of each group in turn. By applying our algorithm on real data, two reported epitopes of spike proteins of SARS-CoV can be found in our resulting itemset and the proportional FT data mining is better than the fixed FT data mining for this application.",

For example, in bioinformatics, biological data grow exponentially in size and complexity. It is not an easy work to extract useful information from it. Thus an important goal of data mining in bioinformatics is to extract valuable information from a large amount incomprehensible, biological data. Traditional algorithmical techniques use pattern matching algorithms to find valuable information for biological sequences. For example, linear scan (Knuth et al. 1977) and suffix tree (Ukkonen 1995) are two wellknown approaches. For more references and applications on patter matching, we refer to (Gusfield 1997) .",

For example, in the analysis of association rules of a metabolic pathway, the rule \"Gene 1 \u2192 Gene 2 , support=10%, confidence=90%\" means that the support of 10% indicates that Gene 1 and Gene 2 are expressed together in 10% of all datasets, and the confidence of 90% indicates that 90% of the metabolic pathway which activated Gene 1 also correlated with Gene 2 .

This influential algorithm generates candidate patterns according to the non-monotonicity heuristic. The two main problems of Apriori are that (1) it needs to scan the database several times and (2) it generates too many candidate patterns. Various techniques have been used to overcome these problems. In Park et al. (1995) , a hash table is used to store candidate patterns to increase the scanning efficiency; Agrawal and Srikant (1994) , Han and Fu (1995) , and Park et al. (1995) attempt to reduce the number of transactions scanned in future iterations; Savasere et al. (1995) and Zaki (2000) adopt the techniques of partitioning and sampling; and Brin et al. (1997) proposes a dynamic pattern-counting method in which candidate patterns are added at different points during a scan. And the negative association rules are considered in Antonie and Za\u00efane (2004) ; Thiruvady and Webb (2004) ; Zhang and Zhang (2004) . Moreover, the problem of mining temporal indirect association patterns is considered in Chen et al. (2006) .",

This algorithm scans the database to find all frequent items, and compresses the database by representing the frequent items in an FP-tree. Finally, all frequent patterns can be obtained by searching the tree. When the database is large, it is sometimes unrealistic to construct an FP-tree that resides in main memory. This leads to the proposed extension of the pattern-growth concept, namely, H-mine. H-mine designs a dynamic structure to adjust links dynamically, instead of requiring an FP-tree to be maintained or a physical database to be created. The motivation of this method is to preserve space, and initially involves loading transactions into memory. However, H-mine has to maintain a head table at each level of the tree, and modify the links to build a queue of the collection of transactions containing the same prefix before the pattern support is counted.",

Matrix Apriori (Pavon et al. 2006) utilizes simple structures such as matrices and vectors in the process of generating frequent patterns, and it also minimizes the number of candidate sets. In (Lee et al. 2006) , the idea of compressions rules is proposed and a data mining structure is used to extract association rules from a database. Redundant data will then be replaced by means of compression rules. (Chu et al. 2005 ) uses a simple method to transform the transactions read from the database into their corresponding patterns and then accumulates the occurring times of these patterns. (Chen et al. 2002) refines sampling functions to a two-phase sampling based algorithm that attempts to reduce the errors caused by sampling functions. (Chen and Ho 2005) proposed a sampling-based method that contains three phases. The first phase draws a small sample of data to estimate the set of frequent patterns, denoted as FS. The second phase computes the actual supports of the patterns in FS as well as identifies a subset of patterns in FS that need to be further examined in the next phase. Finally, the third phase explores this set and finds all missing frequent patterns.",

However, these symptoms are seldom present at the same time, and hence a doctor will not diagnose the disease exactly following the rule R1: {coughing, fever, runny nose, headache, sore throat} \u00e0{catch a cold}. Instead, a better rule corresponding to the real-world situation would be R2: Patients who have at least two of the following symptoms {coughing, fever, runny nose, headache, sore throat} are catching a cold. R2 requires matching just part of the data, which illustrates the sense of allowing for fault tolerance in data mining. Yang et al. (2001) was the first to propose discovering FT frequent patterns in many dimensions. Their primary motivation was to find frequent groups of transactions (user groups, web sessions, and so on.) instead of focusing on just the items themselves, allowing for the discovery of groups of similar transactions that share most items.

            "text": "The main defect of Pei et al. (2001) and Wang and Lee (2002) is their definition of the number of tolerable faults in a pattern as a fixed number. Defining the number of tolerable faults in the patterns as a fixed number of items is not objective. The matters of \"tolerant 1 item\" in a pattern with length 4 and that in a pattern with length 10 give people entirely different sense. For example, the function of a protein is determined by its structure but not sequence. It is possible that two proteins of similar function have different sequence lengths, e.g., the family of heat shock proteins. In this case, it is hard to mine them together using FT pattern mining with fixed number of tolerable faults. In this paper, we introduce the problem of mining proportional FT patterns; in these patterns, the number of tolerable faults in the pattern is proportional to the pattern length. Two approaches are proposed to solve this problem. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: background knowledge and problem definitions are presented in Section 2, the principles underlying our approaches are presented in Section 3, Section 4 describes the experimental results, and the conclusions and future work are discussed in Section 5.",

For example, ELISA (Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay) is one of well-known Immunochemical methods. The epitope prediction problem is to predict epitopes on proteins. Many viruses have a spike protein that has similar function and location within the viral membrane. However, the spike protein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has noted low amino acid homology with other viral spike proteins. The low similarity of amino acid sequence suggests that the spike protein of SARS-CoV may have additional functions other than the usual functions of coronavirus spike proteins (Rota et al. 2003) . For SARS-CoV, the spike protein is about 1,255 amino acids long in general. The spike protein plays an important role in interactions with receptor and inducing neutralizing antibodies. Currently, only two epitopes are reported for SARS-CoV spike proteins, namely, \"KLRPFERDISNV\" and \"PDPLKPTKRSF\" (Saha et al. 2005) . In this subsection, we consider the linear epitope prediction problem on spike proteins of SARS-CoV.",

It is like local view (a protein) versus global view (a group of related proteins). However, as mentioned above, the spike proteins of SARS-CoV are low similarity with the spike proteins of other coronaviruses. Thus, we only consider the spike proteins of SARS-CoV. Nevertheless, spike proteins among SARS-CoV are still not similar. That is, the idea of finding common segments in these proteins does not work.

In contrast to previous studies on FT data mining, the number of tolerable faults in FT patterns found by our approach is proportional to the length of the patterns. The maximum number of tolerable faults can be obtained by evaluating the maximum possible length of an FT pattern. Two algorithms that find an effective solution to the problem of mining proportional FT frequent patterns are designed. The FT-BottomUp algorithm generates all candidate patterns with the number of fault items at each level. The FT-LevelWise algorithm divides all FT patterns into several groups, generates candidate patterns from both sides of each group, and applies some criteria to prune candidate patterns. Both algorithms extract the complete set of FT patterns. The experiments demonstrate the scalability of FT-LevelWise, which clearly performs much better than FT-BottomUp since it does not need to generate as many candidate patterns, with the database scanning time being half that of FT-BottomUp. By applying our algorithm on real data as shown in Section 4.2, two reported epitopes of spike proteins of SARS-CoV can be found in our resulting itemset and the proportional FT data mining is better than the fixed FT data mining for this application. Based upon our results, there is an ongoing challenge to find more efficient algorithms to improve the scalability of mining proportional FT frequent patterns. Another direction is to apply proportional FT data mining to real-world databases such as medical data or biological data though our proposed concept is general. As mentioned, biological data grow very fast. It is unavoidable that its data may contain noise or contaminated data. Therefore, the technique of proportional FT data mining will become an important tool in bioinformatics or biomedicine.",
