For many infections, however, to distinguish a vaccine-induced antibody response from that which follows natural infection is not possible. Additionally, after an initial successful vaccination, antibody levels might wane to become undetectable. Although these com plications preclude simple interpretations of serological assays in the context of vaccination, they are an opportunity to develop new analytical techniques-eg, beyond positive versus negative to a quantitative assess ment that might distinguish exposure from infection associated with trans mission. Separation of natural and vaccinal immunity would be extremely useful where vaccination coverage is uncertain. However, by contrast with veterinary vaccines, 7 this diffi cult task has not been widely attempted for human infections, and is currently feasible for only a few infections, such as tetanus (infection does not lead to sustained antibody responses) and hepatitis B virus (vaccination only induces antibodies to the surface protein whereas infection also induces antibodies to the core protein). Increasing interest in the development of labelled vaccines is likely to substantially extend this range of infections, especially for newly developed vaccines.",

Successful templates for this approach were provided when prevalence of hepatitis surface antigen was used as an indicator of disease burden, 8 and age-specifi c prevalence of rubella antibody was used to estimate burden of congenital rubella syndrome. 9 Serological surveys in sentinel areas (focal areas for surveillance) could allow strategic deployment of vaccination or other interventions, maximising use of resources and timely intervention to benefi t the entire population. For areas where immunity against a pathogen wanes, age profi les of serology can give insights into the rates of both waning and boosting of immunity from exposure to the infection (protective titres need to be known). Additional data availability would enable increased methodological research into both these inferential questions, and the connected question of translating age prevalence of infection into transmission intensity.",

If these questions can be addressed, serum banks for broad multipathogen targeting could be used to address various public health priorities, such as success of mass drug administration for neglected tropical diseases. 10 A combination of laboratory innovations (eg, automation, to circumvent laborious individual analyses) and analytical innovations are likely to be needed.

With this scheme in place, annual age stratifi ed sampling of serology at key sentinel sites worldwide could provide a unique window into the global landscape of immunity. Both opportunistic analysis of existing samples and purpose built serum banks could contribute to this resource. Opportunistic samples might be particularly valuable with unusual patterns of infection-eg, showing the extent to which the immune landscape has constrained emergence of enteroviruses in Asia. 12 The potential for global spread of emerging infections underscores the importance of a global serological bank. In the recent outbreaks of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV; in 2012) and Ebola virus (which began in 2013) it would have been invaluable to know if any evidence showed pre-existing immunity to these diseases in the populations where they emerged, clarifying the role of unseen infections or cross-immunity with other pathogen strains.",
