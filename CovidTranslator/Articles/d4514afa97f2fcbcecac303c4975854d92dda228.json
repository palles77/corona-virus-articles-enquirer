Significantly, both compounds exhibited potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 infection activity in a cell-based assay with an EC 50 value of 0.42 \u03bc M and 0.33 \u03bc M, respectively. The X-ray crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 M pro in complex with 11a and 11b were determined at 1.5 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. The crystal structures showed that 11a and 11b are covalent inhibitors, the aldehyde groups of which are bound covalently to Cys145 of M pro . Both compounds showed good PK properties in vivo, and 11a also exhibited low toxicity which is promising drug leads with clinical potential that merits further studies.",

The difference in binding is probably due to the aryl group of 11b at P2. Compared with the cyclohexyl group in 11a, the aryl group undergoes a significant rotation (Figure 2C) . The side chains of residues His41, Met49, Met165 and Val186 interact with this aryl group through hydrophobic interactions ( Figure   2D ). The side chain of Gln189 stabilizes the aryl group with an additional hydrogen bond ( Figure 2D ).

To make matters worse, no clinically effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs are currently available for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infections. The combination of \u03b1 -interferon and the anti-HIV drugs Lopinavir/Ritonavir (Kaletra\u00ae) is the current clinical treatment strategy, but the curative effect remains very limited and toxic side effects cannot be ignored. Remdesivir, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug developed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., is the clinical drug under development for the treatment of new coronavirus pneumonia, but more data are needed to prove its efficacy to treat COVID-19 9,10,11 . Specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 drugs with efficiency and safety are urgently needed.

To facilitate the explanation of the binding mode of 11a, we will introduce it according to the chemical skeleton of this compound (P1\u2032: aldehyde group; P1: (S)\u03b3 -lactam ring; P2: cyclohexyl; P3: indole group). The electron density showed that the C of the aldehyde group of 11a and the catalytic site Cys145 of SARS-CoV-2 M pro form a standard 1.8 \u00c5 C-S covalent bond (Figure 2B), which suggests a Michael addition reaction. Furthermore, the oxygen atom of the aldehyde group also plays a crucial role for stabilizing the conformations of the inhibitor by forming hydrogen bonds with backbone of residues Cys145 and Gly143 in the S1\u2032 site (Figure 2B). The (S)-\u03b3-lactam ring of 11a at P1 favorably inserts into the S1 site (Figure 2B). The oxygen of the (S)-\u03b3-lactam group interacts with the side chain of His163 by hydrogen bond. The main chain of Phe140 and side chain of Glu166 also participate in stabilizing the (S)-\u03b3-lactam ring by forming hydrogen bonds with the NH group. In addition, the amide bonds on the chain of 11a are hydrogen-bonded with the main chains of His164 and Glu166, respectively (Figure 2B). The cyclohexyl moiety of author/funder. All rights reserved.
