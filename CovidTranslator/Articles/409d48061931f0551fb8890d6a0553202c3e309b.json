A multidisciplinary group of scientists from Manitoba used the combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and a quadrupole/time-of-flight mass spectrometer to identify two novel proteins associated with the virus believed to be responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] . At that time the SARS outbreak had spread from China to Hong Kong, Vietnam, Canada, the USA, and several other countries leading to increasing worldwide concern of a pandemic. The unique attributes of mass spectrometry, especially using hybrid instrumentation, allowed rapid identification and characterization of possible immunogens that may be useful for early diagnosis or prophylaxis of SARS.",

Although these QqToF instruments have been commercially available for less than 10 years, they are widespread because of their full scan sensitivity, good mass spectral resolution and mass accu-racy, and their capability to perform MS and product ion MS/MS analyses. This kind of \"hybridization\" in mass spectrometry is now driving new instrument development because it allows the addition (or replacement) of sections of conventional tandem mass spectrometers with devices that provide different or superior performance characteristics. Novel mass spectrometers have been reported recently, but this is relatively rare. Much of the commercial instrument development of \"new\" instrumentation takes the form of this hybridization approach.",

            "text": "There are two fundamentally different approaches to MS/MS [2] : tandem-in-space and tandem-in-time. Tandemin-space instruments have two independent mass spectrometers in physically different locations in the instrument. Examples of these instruments include, but are not limited to, triple quadrupole (QqQ) and quadrupole/ timeof-flight (QqToF) instruments. The most common MS/MS mode of operation is the product ion scan in which the first quadrupole selects a precursor ion. The precursor ion is then subjected to collision-activated dissociation in a collision cell, and a mass spectrum of the resulting fragment ions is captured with the final mass spectrometer. Although the collision cell can be an RF-only quadrupole, hexapole, octapole, or ring guide, these instruments will be referred to as QqQ devices. A very common mode of operation is multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in which the two resolving quadrupoles monitor specific precursorto-fragment ion transitions by \"hopping\" between the appropriate m/z values. MRM operation maximizes the instrument duty cycle and is often used for quantitation applications. Other less frequently used, but very selective, MS/MS scans for identification of targeted analytes in complicated matrices are the precursor ion and constant neutral loss scans. Here, the first mass analyzer is scanned while the second analyzer is fixed (precursor ion scan) or scanned at a set mass difference from the first (constant neutral loss scan) [3] . These tandem-in-space mass spectrometers have the advantage of independent optimization of each stage of mass analysis.",

The various stages of mass spectrometry are conducted within the same physical trapping volume but at different times during the experiment. The approach here allows the ions from the ion source into the trapping volume, isolating the precursor ions of interest by ejecting the unwanted ions, fragmenting the precursor ions, and performing a final mass analysis step. In principle these devices are capable of many, or \"n\", stages of mass spectrometry, leading to the term \"MS n \". Ion trapping instruments are inherently scanning instruments and are, in general, capable of survey MS and product ion MS/MS operation only. However, since they can record a complete mass spectrum of each pulse of ions introduced into the trapping volume, they are very sensitive instruments.",

The enhanced resolution compared to a standard quadrupole, which operates with peak widths of approximately 0.5-0.7 amu (FWHM), has been shown to be yield additional selectivity in precursor ion selection for product ion spectra as well as distinguishing isobaric interferences [5, 6] . Although good mass accuracy has been reported previously for LC/MS/MS [7] analyses using a conventional triple quadrupole and moderate mass resolution, it is the advent of the narrower peak widths that has spurred interest in the use of triple quadrupole platform for accurate mass measurements. The published capabilities [5, 6] suggest that some combination of internal and external mass calibration should allow reasonable mass assignment accuracy with the enhanced resolution triple quadrupole.",

Most commercial QqToF instruments employ an orthogonal geometry for injection of the ions into the ToF section, which decouples the ion velocity in the ion beam from the TOF axis [9] .

The idea here is that a population of ions characterized by different charge states can be collisionally cooled to thermal energies via trapping and storing in the collision cell. The trapped ions experience different axial DC barriers to exit the collision cell that are proportional to their charge states. As the magnitude of the repulsive exit DC barrier is reduced, singly charged ions are released toward the ToF section first, followed by doubly charged ions, and so on. The result is the ability to identify multiply charged ions from the ion source that previously were completely obscured by singly charged chemical noise ions [15] .",

They have been particularly concerned with protein identification and characterization in very complicated mixtures. Their goal has been to expand the dynamic range of the FTMS by utilizing as much of the ICR trap capacity as possible to store and mass analyze the less abundant ions. FTMS instruments are ion trapping devices and can suffer from mass spectral distortions from space charge. Smith's group has devised an instrument that, under software control, sequentially resonantly ejects and eliminates abundant species in an external linear quadrupole ion trap [34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40] . This allows preferential filling of the ICR cell with the increasingly less abundant ions in a stepwise manner.

Massselective radial ion ejection involves trapping the ions in a four-rod quadrupole structure and resonantly ejecting the ions radially through a slot cut in one of the quadrupole rods. Schwartz et al. have demonstrated that replacement of a conventional three-dimensional ion trap with a radial ejection linear ion trap yields detection limit improvements of about 5 times as well as the ability to conduct all of the standard ion trap scan modes [43] . The sensitivity enhancement is due to the considerably larger ion capacity of linear ion traps, which has been estimated to be more than an order of magnitude larger than that of a conventional ion trap. High ejection efficiencies were reported, despite the fact that the ions being ejected from this radial ejection linear ion trap emerge from a slot cut in one of the quadrupole rods [43] .",

A commercial product with a QqQ linear ion trap geometry combines all of the features of a conventional triple quadrupole mass spectrometer and a linear ion trap [47, 48] . One product ion scan mode uses the first quadrupole for precursor ion selection and the collision cell for fragmentation prior to ion introduction into the linear ion trap [47] . The analytical mass scan is conducted with the linear ion trap. During the analytical scan the instrument can accumulate ions from the ion source enhancing duty cycle, and ultimately, sensitivity [47] . The advantages to this tandem-in-space approach are that only the fragment and residual precursor ions are admitted into the ion trap thereby preserving dynamic range. Also, since the fragmentation step and the final mass analysis steps are spatially separated there is no inherent low mass cutoff in the product ion spectra. Sensitivity gains of factors greater than 500 times that of standard triple quadrupole product ion scan mode have been reported [47] .",
