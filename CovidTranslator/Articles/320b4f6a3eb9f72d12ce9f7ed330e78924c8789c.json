Some perceive compulsion as an infringement of civil liberties and parental rights, and believe that the potential benefits of compulsory immunisation are outweighed by the ethical problems that they pose, primarily for the autonomy of parents [13] . Others maintain that the protection of public health can justify the use of compulsory measures and assert that compulsory vaccination ensures greater equity in society since all members share the risks and benefits of vaccination equally [14] . This paper is based on a study that explored which public health interventions a cross-section of people across Europe would be willing to accept; their reasons for accepting or rejecting specific public health policies and their enforcement; and how people balanced public and private interest. This paper reports the study findings in relation to immunisation. At the time the focus groups were held certain immunisations were compulsory in Belgium, Greece, Italy and Poland, with non-compliance theoretically punishable by fines or temporary imprisonment for the parents and refusal of school enrolment for children; financial incentives aimed to encourage parents to have their children immunised in Austria; and financial incentives aimed to encourage healthcare professionals to increase immunisation coverage in Ireland and the United Kingdom [15] . In contrast, immunisation was completely voluntary and without incentives in Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and other countries (although this is not to deny the existence of social pressure or pressure from healthcare professionals to immunise).",

Focus groups were held during September and October 2003 when the global panic surrounding Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was at a peak. This may have heightened public awareness over the dangers of communicable diseases and thus possibly increased support for immunisation per se and for State powers to impose vaccinations. However, this was also a time when fears over vaccine safety continued to be in the public consciousness in particular countries [19] , for example, MMR in Ireland, Italy and the UK [20] [21] [22] [23] and the use of mercury as a binding agent in the USA [6, 24, 25] . In some countries such concerns may have reduced support for immunisation and/or led to greater support for parental freedom to choose. It The focus groups each lasted approximately 2 h and were conducted in the appropriate local language. During the 2h sessions, a range of public health policies and potential interventions were discussed, including childhood immunisation, the fluoridation of public water supplies [26] , smoking, the physical punishment of children, the legalisation of cannabis, Not In My Back Yard issues (NIMBY-ism) and preferences for a high tax/high State provision society or a low tax/low State provision society. Participants spent no longer than 20 min discussing immunisation. The question on immunisation asked: Should the decision as to whether to vaccinate their own child be left to the parents? Or should vaccinations be enforced by the government in order to keep diseases (such as measles which can cause more death and damage to more children than the risks associated with the vaccine) out of society as a whole?",

Regardless, this obligation informed the debates in each of those countries where compulsory legislation currently exists. Indeed, some participants in the Polish focus groups queried why they were asked to comment on a law that already exists. On the whole, focus group participants (in each of those countries where some compulsion already existed) supported compulsory immunisation: Focus group discussions in Germany were particularly illustrative of this support for the status quo. Compulsory immunisation was supported by a majority of the focus group participants in the former East Germany where certain immunisations were previously compulsory.

Instead, some studies report that immunisation status is more closely related to socio-demographic characteristics [38] , with low immunisation coverage correlated with low socioeconomic status [39] . However, the only discernable socio-demographic difference in attitudes toward immunisation noted in the current study was that focus group participants who were also parents tended to have stronger views on immunisation. Whether this was support for or against immunisation correlated with the intensity of recent vaccine scares and participants' expression of trust in the reassurances of family doctors and State public health authorities.",

The focus group data indicate a correlation between support for compulsory immunisation and the existence of compulsory immunisation policies in certain countries. It is not possible to confirm the direction of causality as the correlation could suggest a degree of normalisation whereby laws on compulsory immunisation gradually become part of a cultural norm or, conversely, the legislation could reflect the public's concern to maintain high levels of immunisation coverage and/or to reduce the incidence of particular childhood diseases. Similarly, in relation to trust, the existence of compulsory measures could imply any number of positions on a spectrum ranging from State lack of trust in parents to immunise their children in the absence of compulsion; public trust in the advice of the State (and hence support for compulsion in the belief that not all parents would have their children immunised without such pressure); or it could suggest that the public do not trust the advice of the State and thus have to be forced (by legislation) to comply with State policy.",

However, this was very much a minority voice, with generally only one or two participants from each country where the issue was raised making reference to a 'foreign threat'. The fact that the timing of the focus groups coincided with the global panic over Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), a disease spread between countries largely through international travel, could have influenced such comments.",

The latter point is illustrative of the immunisation paradox, a phenomenon whereby the success of previous public health measures, mass immunisation and consequent herd immunity have reduced the prevalence of particular diseases leading parents to believe that the current threat of infection from such diseases is minimal. Some parents may thus refuse to have their children immunised on the grounds that the risks associated with immunisation, though small, are perceived to outweigh the benefits [41] . Paradoxically, the success of immunisation programmes may ultimately reduce take-up rates with the potential for future epidemics of preventable diseases [42] [43] [44] . Again this reflects findings from other studies [45, 46] .",

Sweden provides an interesting example. The MMR scare was widely reported in the Swedish media and was met with a brief decline in immunisation coverage. However, once the public health authorities provided clear and open information relating to the potential risks and benefits of immunisation, high rates of coverage were quickly restored. This suggests that public trust in public health authorities was largely maintained or secured. Indeed, none of the Swedish focus group participants spoke of fears over vaccine safety. By contrast, where participants spent most of their time debating the relative risks of immunisation versus non-immunisation or where they opposed immunisation on the grounds of safety concerns, this tended to correlate with an expressed lack of trust in the advice and reassurances of the State and public health agencies.",

Even in countries where vaccine scares were in the public consciousness and some participants expressed concern over exposing their (hypothetical) child to immunisation, their concern was over the type of vaccination (for example, multiple-antigen vaccines) rather than about immunisation per se. The extent to which participants supported the notion of compulsory immunisation depended largely on whether certain immunisations were already compulsory in their country, whether they trusted the State and public health professionals to take immunisation decisions on their behalf, whether individuals felt they had enough information to make their own informed choices, and the extent to which they felt that compulsion was necessary to ensure that enough other people in their society had their children immunised to achieve herd immunity. Each of these factors is influenced by a myriad of other assumptions, actors and institutions, including family, community, media, religious beliefs, political structures and historical factors.
