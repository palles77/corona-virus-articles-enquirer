Binding of viral peptides was affected by the naturally occurring polymorphisms at residues 190 and 192, which are located at second extracellular loop-transmembrane helix 5 interface. Substitution of R190 with W190 enhanced the affinity for a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus peptide 6 fold but reduced the affinity for N-formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe by 2.5 fold. A 12 mer peptide derived from coronavirus 229E (ETYIKPWWVWL) was the most potent antagonist of the formyl peptide receptor W190 with a K i of 230 nM. Fluorescently labeled ETYIKPWWVWL was effectively internalized by all three variants with EC 50 of \u223c25 nM. An HKU-1 coronavirus peptide, MYVKWPWYVWL, was a potent antagonist but N-formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL was a potent agonist. ETYIKPWWVWL did not stimulate GTP\u03b3S binding but inhibited the stimulation by formyl-NleLeuPhe. It also blocked \u03b2 arrestin translocation and receptor downregulation induced by formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe. This indicates that formyl peptide receptor may be important in viral infections and that variations in its sequence among individuals may affect their likelihood of viral and bacterial infections.",

It is thought to play an important role in allowing phagocytic cells to recognize the presence of bacteria, which are believed to be the source of formyl peptides [3] . FPR is activated by other ligands in addition to fMLF. FPR binds peptides derived from the GP-41 envelope protein of HIV-1 [4, 5] . FPR activation is inhibited by a polypeptide secreted by S. aureus [6, 7] , an undecapeptide (Cyclosporin H) derived from the fungus Tolypocladium inflatum [8] , and peptides derived from murine leukemia virus and human T cell leukemia virus [9] . A peptide derived from herpes simplex virus type 2 elicited chemotaxis and superoxide production in neutrophils in a process that appeared to involve FPR [10] .

No polymorphisms were found in the closely related receptor FPRL1 [13] . One possible reason for the existence of polymorphisms is that polymorphisms might prevent pathogens from binding to receptors and using them as an entry point into cells. Several G protein-coupled receptors have been used by pathogens as a point of entry into cells and the use of CCR5 and CXCR4 as co-receptors for HIV-1 and CXCR4 as a co-receptor for FIV are notable examples [14] [15] [16] . The CCR5 receptor in African green monkeys [17] has been shown to be polymorphic and these polymorphisms provide some protection against SIV infection.",

Anti \u03b2arrestin antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories) at 250 \u03bcg/ml in PBS was incubated with 5 mM 6-(fluorescein-5-carboxamido)hexanoic acid, succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and the labeled antibody was purified by HPLC gel filtration on a Sigmachrome 100 column. The antibody contained approximately 1.5 moles of fluorescein/mole of antibody.",

Since gp41 is a fusion glycoprotein which contains two heptad repeat regions, we chose viral glycoproteins with this property. T20/DP178 is derived from the second heptad repeat region of HIV-1 gp41 but also includes residues C-terminal to the end of the heptad 2 repeat region [28] . Sainz et al. called these residues in HIV-1 and SARS coronavirus the \"aromatic rich region\" and they noted a similar region in Ebola virus [29] . This region has also been called the membrane proximal region. We therefore chose to synthesize peptides from HIV-2 and several human coronaviruses (SARS, OC43, and 229E) that corresponded to T20/DP178 in HIV-1. An alignment of sequences is shown in Table 1 , which also includes the newly discovered coronaviruses HKU-1 and NL-63 [30] [31] [32] and the aromatic rich region from the Ebola spike protein.",

The 12 C-terminal residues of the coronaviruses are highly conserved. The 12 c-terminal residues of HIV-1 T20/DP178 are also highly conserved among known HIV-1 sequences and this 12 amino acid region overlaps the epitopes of 2 broadly protective anti-HIV antibodies 2F5 and 4E10 [33, 34] .12 mer peptides corresponding to C-termini of the sequences for HIV-1, HIV-2, SARS coronavirus, and coronavirus 229E were synthesized (residues are underlined in Table 1 ) as well as a 12 residue peptide corresponding to the aromatic rich region from the Ebola spike protein. We also synthesized smaller peptides of coronavirus 229E to localize residues which might be important in binding (ETYIKWP, WPWWVWL, and WWVWL). [26] . D106 and R201 are the sites of formyl group binding and R205 interacts with the C-terminus of fMLF [25] . The beginning of TMH5 was assigned to residue 191 and the end to residue 228 by hydrophobicity analysis according to Kyte and Doolittle [36] . We analyzed CHO S cells expressing R190/N192, W190/ N192, and R190/K192 FPR for their ability to bind formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-FITC. We observed that the polymorphisms in FPR result in significantly altered formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-FITC binding affinity ( Fig. 2) We then determined the affinities of a broad range of peptides for these three polymorphisms based on their ability to compete with formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-FITC (Table 2) . We observed that R190/K192 exhibited the highest affinity for formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe (chosen over fMLF in order to prevent possible oxidation of methionine) and MMWLL, a potent nonformylated chemoattract for FPR, [25, 37] . Both formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe and MMWLL bound with \u223c3 fold higher affinities to R190/K192 than to W190/N192. W190/N192 had the highest affinity for most virally derived peptides, especially the coronavirus peptides. W190/N192 bound the SARS coronavirus peptides with 4-6 fold higher affinity than either R190/N192 or R190/K192. This indicates that changes in these two positions affected ligand specificity, but most of the change in specificity was associated with the R to W change at residue 190. Most of the binding affinity of the coronavirus 229E peptides appears to reside in the 5 C-terminal residues since WWVWL exhibited only a modest reduction in affinity compared to ETYIKWPWWVWL. ETYIKWP was completely devoid of activity. WPWWVWL had similar affinity to WWVWL. ETYIKWPWWVWL bound to all three FPR variants with 15 to 30 fold higher affinity than the [25, 26, 35] .

The EC 50 s for internalization were \u223c4 fold lower than the K d for binding (R190/N192, R190/K192, and W190/N192; 29\u00b1 5 nM, 27\u00b1 8 nM, and 20 \u00b1 3 nM, respectively). This indicates that either the affinity of ETYIK-(Alexa Fluor)WPWWVWL for FPR is greater at 37\u00b0C used for internalization than at 4\u00b0C used in the binding experiments to prevent internalization or that saturation of the internalization process occurs at concentrations well below those required for receptor saturation. Since the peptides behaved as antagonists, we were somewhat surprised that they were so readily internalized. This probably reflects turnover of FPR on the cell surface, since treatment of the cells with ETYIKWPWWVWL did not result in net receptor down regulation (see Fig. 9 ) below. Nonetheless, it indicates that if a virus interacts with FPR, it could be effectively internalized even if it is unable to activate the receptor.",

Interestingly, formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa Fluor fluorescence internalized by W190/N192 FPR was enhanced in the presence of 0.1% SDS by 95 \u00b1 5%, but 0.1% SDS did not affect the fluorescence of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa Fluor internalized by either R190/N192 FPR or R190/K192 FPR. This indicates that W190 quenches the fluorescence of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa Fluor by \u223c50% when it is bound to the receptor and thus must be sufficiently near the Alexa Fluor moiety of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa Fluor when the peptide is bound to W190/N192 FPR so that W190 can contact AlexFluor during the excited state [38] . This indicates that W190 resides in or very close to the ligand binding pocket (\u223c1 to 1.5 nm average distance [38] ). Since Alexa Fluor-ETYIKWPWWVWL exhibited twice the fluorescence of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa Fluor when bound to W190/ N192 (the expected value if it was not quenched), it is unlikely that W190 can come in contact with the Alexa Fluor of ETYIK-(Alexa Fluor)WPWWVW when bound to FPR. After correcting for the quenching of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa Fluor on W190/N192, we estimate that ETYIK-(Alexa Fluor)WPW-WVW is internalized at about 20-30% of the rate of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa Fluor in R190/N192, R190/K192, and W190/N192, based on their relative internalization rates by FACScan. This level of internalization was too low to accurately quantitate by direct fluorescence readings so the degree of quenching of Alexa Fluor-ETYIKWPWWVWL could only be estimated by FACScan analysis.",

Both 300 nM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe and 300 nM formyl-MYVKWP-WYVWL stimulated GTP\u03b3S binding in all three FPR variants, but neither ETYIKWPWWVWL nor MYVKWPWYVWL had any effect on the three FPR variants (Fig. 5 ). This indicated that the formyl group on formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL was essential for agonist activity but not for binding. 2 \u03bcM MYVKWPWYVWL inhibited 300 nM formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding by W190/N192 FPR by 60% but did not have a significant effect on formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding in either R190/N192 FPR or R190/K192 FPR. This is consistent with the data in Table 2 where formylation of MYVKWPWYVWL enhanced the affinity for R190/N192 and R190/K192 by 6 fold but only 2 fold for W190/N192. We then tested ETYIKWPWWVWL for its ability to inhibit the stimulation of GTP\u03b3S by 300 nM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe (Fig. 6 ). ETYI-KWPWWVWL was more effective in inhibiting the stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding in W190/N192 (EC 50 = 300 \u00b1 120 nM; (P =0.003 vs. R190/K192; P = 0.005 vs. R190/N192)) than either R190/N192 (EC 50 = 1600\u00b1 400 nM) or R190/K192 (EC 50 = 1600 \u00b1 440 nM). These results are consistent with the results in Table 2 , which show that W190/N192 has a similar affinity for formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe and ETYIKWPWWVWL but that R190/N192 and R190/K192 have 6-8 fold higher affinities for formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe than ET-YIKWPWWVWL. We also tested ETYIKWP and WWVWL for their ability to inhibit the stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding by 300 nM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe in W190/N192 FPR. The results are shown in Fig. 7 . WWVWL inhibited formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe stimulation of GTP\u03b3S binding with a slightly higher EC 50 (EC 50 =1300 nM) than ETYIKWPWWVWL (EC 50 = 300 \u00b1 120 nM). ETYIKWP had no effect. Again this is consistent with the results shown in Table 2 . We also tested the HIV-1 36 mer and the Ebola virus 12 mer for their effects on GTP\u03b3S binding. As observed with ETYIKWPWWV-WL, neither peptide at 10 \u03bcM stimulated GTP\u03b3S binding but both peptides at 10 \u03bcM markedly inhibited the stimulation by 300 nM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe (data not shown).",

African American patients expressing the R190/K192 polymorphism were associated with increased risk of aggressive periodontitis whereas those expressing the W190/N192 polymorphism were associated with reduced risk [24] . Our data clearly show no evidence that R190/K192 is defective and we find that W190/N192 exhibited a 2.6 fold lower affinity for formyl peptides than R190/K192. Zhang et al. also reported that R190/ K192 was not associated with an increased risk of aggressive periodontitis among either Brazilians or Turks nor was W190/ N192 associated with reduced incidence of aggressive periodontal disease in these two populations [24] so it was unclear why this association was only true for African Americans. A recent study by Maney et al. [44] was unable to confirm the association of aggressive periodontitis with R190/K192 in African Americans, but did find an association with a silent polymorphism I116I. Our data finding no defect in R190/K192 are consistent with the study of Maney et al.

            "text": "In Fig. 1 , we show the relative positions of R/W 190 and N/K 192 at the extracellular loop 2-TMH5 interface to other residues in FPR which we previously identified as important in ligand binding [25, 26, 35] . We previously determined that D106 and R201 likely form an ion pair between TMH3 and TMH5 and that this ion pair imparts formyl group selectivity to ligand binding since mutation of either residue changes the preference of formylated to non-formylated peptide from 4000/1 to \u223c1/3 and 1/1, respectively, for D106N and R201A [25] . Here we observe that W190 is likely to be close to the lys residue of formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa Fluor since quenching of the Alexa Fluor fluorophore is observed only in W190/N192 and not in either R190/ N192 or R190/K192. It is likely therefore that when bound, formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-Alexa Fluor is in a somewhat helical conformation (it contains residues with high helical propensity) with the formyl group near R201 and the AlexFluor moiety near W190 and presumably near R190 as well. This mode of binding is different from that proposed for fMLF where the Cterminus of fMLF interacts with R205 [25] . This is consistent with our previous observations that mutation of R205 to A results in a 1000 fold reduction of affinity to fMLF [25] but only an 8 fold reduction in affinity for formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe-Nle-Tyr-Lys-FITC [26] . Given that W190/N192 binds coronaviral peptides better than R190/N192 or R190/K192, it is likely that W190 interacts with some as yet unidentified residues in these peptides. One explanation of why R190/K192 binds formyl peptides better than W190/N192 is that the former contains two additional positive charges. Formylation removes the positive charge from the N-terminus of peptides. If R190 is near the entry site of the ligand, the positive charge would repel peptides with free N-termini but allow entry of formylated ones. Since formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe has a net negative charge, it would be attracted toward R190 but not W190. W190 would be expected to exhibit a relative preference for peptides with free N-termini and peptides with net positive charges compared to R190. This is consistent with our observation that MYVKWPWYVWL exhibits a 3 fold higher affinity for W190/N192 than for R190/N192 or R190/K192 and that formylation of MYVKWPWYVWL enhances its affinity 6 fold with R190/N192 and R190/K192 but only 2 fold with W190/ N192. Formyl-MYVKWPWYVWL has a net charge of zero, and it binds equally well to all three variants.",

[4] originally observed that DP178/T-20, a peptide derived from the C-terminal HR and membrane proximal region of gp41 of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), elic-ited chemotaxis in neutrophils and monocytes. They determined that this chemotaxis was a result of its ability to bind to and activate FPR. Su et al. [4] also observed that shorter versions of DP-178 acted as antagonists of FPR. We subsequently showed that DP178 binds to FPR expressed in CHO S cells and observed that two FPR mutants (D106N and R201A) , which bind fMLF poorly, exhibited an enhanced ability (30 fold and 3 fold, respectively) to bind DP178/T20 [25] . Here we observed that R190/ N192, W190/N192, and R190/N192 FPR variants all exhibited similar affinities for DP178/T20 and that DP178/T20 behaved as an antagonist based upon its inability to stimulate GTP\u03b3S binding and its ability to inhibit the stimulation of GTP\u03b3S by formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe.",

            "text": "HR regions appear to be a common motif in many viral fusion proteins [45] . They exist as sequential helical domains; one n terminal HR region (HR1) adjacent to the fusion peptide and a cterminal HR region (HR2) close to the transmembrane anchor. Peptides derived from the HR2 and proximal membrane regions of HIV-1, SIV, HRSV, human parainfluenza virus type 3, measles virus, and a coronavirus have all been shown to be able to block virus infection [28, [46] [47] [48] . A twelve mer peptide derived from the proximal membrane region of FIV gp41, QLQKWEDWVRWI, was a potent (low nanomolar) inhibiter of FIV infection [49] . Here we observed that peptides derived from the proximal membrane region of HIV-1, HIV-2, Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, and coronavirus 229E act as antagonists to the formyl peptide receptor. The coronavirus peptides are the most potent antagonists and these peptides exhibited an enhanced affinity for W190/N192 FPR. Our observation that tryptophan-rich peptides act as antagonists is consistent with the observation of Bae et al., who observed that WRWWWW was a potent antagonist for FPRL1 and FPRL2 [50, 51] . WRWWWW did not affect FPR [50] , and it has been shown that DP178/T20 does not bind to FPRL1 [4] , indicating that these receptors have slightly different ligand binding specificities but that both receptors may bind tryptophan rich peptides. A recently discovered FPRL2 agonist is also tryptophan rich [52] and the C-terminus of that peptide, WPWQVL, is remarkably similar to WPWWVWL which we found to be a potent antagonist for FPR. The FPRL2 agonist did not, however, bind to or activate FPR.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are common infections among the human population [53, 54] and as such might affect the evolution of FPR if they were able to attach to FPR, become internalized, and spread through the body on the many cells that express FPR [55] . On the other hand, it is possible that FPR's ability to bind virally derived peptides allows it in some way to recognize the presence of a viral infection and inhibit its spread. A recent report showed that HIV-1 viruses are inactivated by transport to acidic endosomes and proteosomes and that blocking these processes can increase HIV-1 infectivity by up to 400 fold [56] . If FPR could bind viruses and transport them to endosomes and proteosomes, this might result in protection against viral infection. Another possibility is that FPR could serve as a \"fly-trap\" for viruses and prevent them from finding their appropriate receptor. Also, FPR might interact with the aromatic rich region subsequent to virus binding to a surface receptor and prevent membrane fusion. The scenarios are not of course mutually exclusive and the binding of viruses to FPR could have positive or negative consequences depending on the exact Fig. 9 . Down regulation of FPR surface expression in response to various ligands. Surface expression of FPR in W190/N192 FPR expressing cells, R190/K192 FPR expressing cells, or R190/N192 FPR expressing cells was determined after exposure for 1 h at 37\u00b0to either 10 \u03bcM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe, 10 \u03bcM ETYIKWP-WWVWL, or 10 \u03bcM formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe + 10 \u03bcM ETYIKWPWWVWL. ETYIKWPWWVWL inhibited receptor downregulation in response to formyl-Nle-Leu-Phe by 16 \u00b1 2% in R190/N192 FPR expressing cells, 20\u00b1 2% in R190/ K192 FPR expressing cells, and 64 \u00b1 6% in W190/N192 FPR expressing cells. (P < 0.001 W190/N192 vs. either R190/N192 or R190/K192). situation. Klestadt et al. [57] observed that activation of FPR in THP-1 cells markedly downregulated the expression of CD4 and CD13, the receptors for HIV-1/HIV-2 and coronavirus 229E, respectively [11, 58, 59] . In addition, activation of FPR downregulates the expression of CCR5 and CXCR4 [60] , the co-receptors of HIV-1 and HIV-2 [9, 58] . Thus activation of FPR could serve as protection against viral infection by downregulation of viral receptors, and presumably FPR antagonists would prevent downregulation. Ueda et al. noted that the HIV-1 envelope gp41 was able to down regulate the expression of FPR and other chemokine receptors at low nanomolar concentrations, but that the downregulation of FPR and the chemokine receptors was dependent upon expression of CD4 [61] . Thus, there are a complicated set of interactions between FPR and the receptors and co-receptors of viruses, and FPR may play an important role in viral infections.",
