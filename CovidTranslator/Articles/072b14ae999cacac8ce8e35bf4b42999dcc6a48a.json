            "text": "The second open reading frame of avian reovirus S1 gene segment encodes a 17 kDa non-structural protein, named p17. The biological role of p17 is fully unknown so far. Using trypan blue dye exclusion and MTT assay, we demonstrated that the ectopic expression of p17 results in the reduction of viable cell number and cell proliferation rate of Vero, BHK, 293, and HeLa cells. Measurement of LDH activity and DNA fragmentation analysis revealed that p17 expression did not cause cell death or apoptosis. These data indicated that the p17 possessed the growth retardation function. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting revealed that p17-expressing cells induced the expression of CDK inhibitor p21 cip1/waf1 in a time-and dose-dependent manner, but the transcripts of CDK inhibitor p15 INK4b , p16 INK4a , or p27 kip were not altered. In the presence of p17, the p53 protein level and p53-driven reporter activity were elevated significantly. Dominant negative p53 alleviated the p21 accumulation, p53 activation, and growth inhibition effect induced by p17. Taken together, these studies revealed a possible intrinsic function of p17 in growth regulation through the activation of p53 and p21 cip1/waf1 .",

The infection may be involved in several disease syndromes of which viral arthritis/tenosynovitis in chickens is the most important, particularly in broiler breeds [12] . ARV are members of the Orthoreovirus genus, one of nine genera of the Reoviridae family. They are non-enveloped viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells and contain 10 double-stranded RNA genome segments [18] . All ARV encoded proteins, including 10 structural proteins and four non-structural proteins, have been demonstrated [1] , although very little is known about the functions of most of these proteins. The genome S1 contains three open reading frames which translated membrane fusion protein p10, p17, and cell attachment protein rC [1] . The p17 is a 146 amino acid protein, which has no known biological function and no sequence similarity to other known proteins. Analyzing the amino acid sequence of p17 revealed no functional domain or motif existed. Recent report demonstrated that p17 accumulates in the nucleoplasm of infected and transfected cells. An interspecies heterokaryon assay further showed that p17 shuttles continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These investigators suggested that p17 may participate in cellular nuclear processes such as gene transcription, DNA binding [8] .",

The p53 protein is a key cellular regulator, which mediates several functions such as the cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair or senescence [2] . Furthermore, it has been reported that the induction of p53 expression by viral protein correlates with a reduction of cell proliferation. In the case of Epstein-Barr virus, its nuclear antigen 2 inhibits cell growth by modulating p53 activity [14] . In addition, murine coronavirus non-structural p28 inhibited cell growth in several cell lines that correlated with p53 accumulation [6] . p21 cip1/waf1 is a key downstream mediator of the growth arrest induced by p53 [9] . p53 can stimulate transcription of the p21 cip1/waf1 gene by binding the two p53-response elements located within the p21 cip1/waf1 promoter [9] . Besides the inhibition of cyclin-CDK complexes, p21 cip1/waf1 has been shown to bind and inhibit proliferating cell nuclear antigen, which is involved in DNA replication and repair [10, 13] . The dual function of p21 cip1/waf1 can ensure an efficient block of cell cycle progression [22] . p27 kip , p15 INK4b , and p16 INK4a have all contributed to the formation of hypo-phosphorylation of Rb [7] .",

These cells were then cultured in MEM containing various concentrations of fetal bovine serum at indicated time period. Next, we compared the viable cell number and cell proliferation rate of p17-expressing cells with those of vector transfected cells. Trypan blue day exclusion assay revealed that the viable cell number was reduced in p17-expressing cells as compared with vector transfected cells.

The interesting aspect is that the p17-mediated effect was more clear when cells were cultured in lower serum (1% and 0.1%) condition ( Fig. 2A) .

The cell death was evaluated by the quantification of plasma membrane damage by measuring the release of the cytoplasmic enzyme activity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). The principle of LDH activity determination was a two-step reaction. In the first step, NAD + is reduced to NADH/H + by the LDH-catalyzed conversion of lactate to pyruvate. In the second step, the catalyst (diaphorase) transfer H/H + from NADH/H + to the tetrazolium salt INT (2-[4-iodophenyl]-3-[4-nitrophenyl]-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride) which is reduced to formazan. The increase of LDH activity in the cell culture supernatant directly correlates to the amount of formazan formed during a limited time period [26] . As shown in Fig. 3A , for a 24 and 48 h observation, Vero cells without or with various amounts of p17 expression, under 5% serum or 0.1% serum cultured condition, illustrated a comparable LDH activity level. Cells were treated with 2% Triton X-100 as a high control, which provides information about the maximum releasable LDH activity in the cells. Apoptosis is an alternative cell death way without plasma membrane lysis. The DNA fragmentation was a hallmark feature of apoptosis. Vero cells infected with ARV S1133 strains or ectopically expressed ARV sigma C leaded cells undergoing apoptosis [23] . This result indicated that the p17 expression did not cause the DNA ladder phenomena (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5) . Apoptosis was also monitored by PI followed by flow cytometric analysis, and no signs of apoptosis were revealed in p17-expressing cells or control cells (data not shown). These experiments were performed in BHK, 293, and HeLa cells, and the same results were obtained (data not shown).",

(B) p21 cip1/waf1 protein level was elevated in response to p17 expression but not in control cells. thermore, it is well known that an activated p53 formed tetramer and exerted a specific DNA binding ability to activate downstream genes. We thus analyzed the luciferase reporter activity, which was controlled by a synthetic promoter containing direct repeats of the transcription recognition sequence for p53, in cells with or without p17 expression. Vero cells were transfected with various amounts of p17 expression plasmids together with p53-luciferase reporter DNA. The luciferase activity was expressed as activation folds. Our results clearly revealed that the p53 specific-DNA binding capacity was increased in the presence of p17 in a dose-dependent pattern (Fig. 5B) . The timing of the induction of p53 and p21 cip1/waf1 is almost consistent, suggesting that the induction of transcriptionally active p53, in response to p17, activates the expression level of p21 cip1/waf1 . p17 mediated cell growth inhibition, p53-drived reporter activity induction, and p21 cip1/waf1 induction were abolished by dominant negative p53",

The possible p53-mediated alterations in the viability of the cell were ruled out by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown). When Vero cells expressed dominant negative p53, the p17-induced p53-drived luciferase activity was reduced about 5-to 7-fold (Fig. 6A) , further, the p17mediated growth retardation phenomenon was significantly released (Fig. 6B) . Furthermore, p17-mediated p21 cip1/waf1 induction was abolished in the presence of dominant negative p53 (Fig. 6C, lanes 5 and 6) . Taking all of these results together, we conclude that p17-mediated effect took place through the activation of p53 and p21 cip1/waf1 .",

The current study demonstrated that the p17 expressing Vero, BHK, 293, and HeLa cells grew at a slower rate than control cells. The involved molecular mechanism could, at least partially, be activation of p53 and induction of p21 cip1/waf1 . To our knowledge, this is the first report to show that ARV p17 is capable of retarding cell growth in cultured transiently transfected cells, a novel biological function of p17. The inhibition of cell growth effect of p17 was more dramatic when cells were cultured in low serum medium. We explained that this result may be due to the complex components (e.g., growth factors, serum protein) of fetal bovine serum, and these factors may modulate cellular signaling and cell cycle check point control. In medium with lower serum concentration, the effect of serum component might be reduced.",

A potential role of p17 in regulating nuclear processes was reinforced by our recent finding that p17 has transactivation A B C Fig. 6 . Dominant negative p53 expression releas of the p17-mediated effects. (A) Dominant negative p53 expression blocked the p17-induced p53-drived reporter activity. Luciferase assay of cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(\u00c0) or p17-pcDNA3.1(\u00c0) and p53-driven luciferase reporter upon dominant negative p53 expression. The amounts of the reporter and effector plasmids (lg) transfected were as indicated. pRKbetaGAL expressed b-galactosidase was included here as transfection efficiency normalization standard. The total amount of DNA mixture of each reaction was identical. Three independent experiments were conducted to calculate the standard deviation. (B) MTT assay revealed that dominant negative p53 expression rescued the growth retardation upon p17 expression. b-Galactosidase activity was measured to normalize transfection efficiency. The data represented here are the average of three independent experiments. (C) Western blot analysis demonstrated that the dominant negative p53 expression reduced the p21 cip1/waf1 expression induced by p17 (lanes 3, 4, 5, and 6). function (our unpublished data). More detailed studies were needed to clarify the precise role of p17.",
