Although there have been extensive studies regarding the impact of nucleotide imbalance on cell-cycle progression, DNA replication, and genome stability mainly using cultured cells or yeast (Pai and Kearsey, 2017) , the mechanisms that regulate developmental and metabolic events in animal models in response to NT changes are underexplored.",

We showed that the commonly used Caenorhabditis elegans food, Escherichia coli OP50 strain, provides less dietary pyrimidine than some other E. coli strains, such as the commonly used E. coli HT115 strain that has altered nucleotide metabolism . Cytidine deaminases CDD-1 and CDD-2 catalyze the conversion of cytidine NTs to uridine NTs. The combination of a CDD double-knockout mutant worm and a diet of E. coli OP50 leads to a significantly reduced thymidine pool, which causes a completely sterile phenotype due to the arrest of mitotic germline proliferation . Further analysis also implicates a likely nucleotidesensing system in the intestine that regulates not only mitotic germline proliferation but also NT metabolism when animals encounter genotoxic stress due to NT deficiency or imbalance.",

One of the suppressors we isolated, ku544, effectively suppressed the sterile phenotype ( Figure 1A ) and fully restored the germline morphology of the double mutant (100% wild type [WT] , n = 200) ( Figure S1A ) . We were not able to test the brood size as both cddko worms fed with pyrimidine-rich cytR \u00c0 bacteria and the suppressor strain showed severe egg-laying defects (Figures S1B and * * * * * % adults w/ DNA bridges S1C). We thus indirectly examined fecundity by counting the eggs in adult animals. Our previous study showed feeding with high pyrimidine food (cytR \u00c0 bacteria) strongly suppressed the germline proliferation defects of cddko animals . We found that adult cddko; ku544 animals contained a similar amount of eggs as adult cddko animals fed cytR \u00c0 bacteria (4-day-old cddko; ku544 animals on OP50, 26 \u00b1 2.7 eggs per worm; 4-day-old cddko on cytR \u00c0 , 26.8 \u00b1 4.6 eggs per worm; n = 9 each; p = 0.67, unpaired, two-tailed Student's t test). These results indicate that ku544 is a strong suppressor of germline defects in cddko animals.",

            "text": "Genetic mapping and genome sequencing determined that ku544 is a C-to-T mutation in the endu-2 gene, which encodes a homolog of EndoU (endoribonuclease specific for uridylate) that has been linked to diverse physiological functions in multiple organisms (see Discussion). An alignment between ENDU-2 and its homolog in Xenopus and humans (Laneve et al., 2008; Renzi et al., 2006) demonstrated that all of the amino acids that are critical for its enzymatic activity are conserved in C. elegans ( Figure S1D ). Our ku544 mutation results in a T568I change in the ENDU-2 protein ( Figure S1D ). Mutating the corresponding threonine in XendoU (T278) caused an $80% reduction in nuclease activity in an in vitro assay (Renzi et al., 2006) , suggesting that the suppressor phenotype of endu-2(ku544/T568I) is likely due to a disruption of the nuclease activity of the enzyme. To provide further support for this notion, we created an endu-2(H470A) mutation, which was predicted to abolish the active site (Renzi et al., 2006) ( Figure S1D ). Consistently, while expressing a WT endu-2 transgene (Ex[endu-2]) in the cddko; endu-2(T568I) triple mutant reversed the suppressing effect of endu-2(T568I), a mutant endu-2(H470A) transgene (Ex[endu-2(H470A)]) failed to reverse the suppression ( Figure 1A) . Therefore, the loss of ENDU-2 nuclease activity recovers fertility that was shut down in C. elegans cddko worms fed low-pyrimidine food. In other words, WT ENDU-2 is critically involved in animals' response to a deficiency in the pyrimidine pool. To simplify the presentation, we hereafter refer to the endu-2(ku544/T586I) allele as endu-2(\u00c0).",

Fluorouracil (5-FU) and floxuridine (FUDR) are pyrimidine analogs that inhibit the biosynthesis of deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP). endu-2(\u00c0) worms also showed strong sensitivity to 5-FU and modest sensitivity to FUDR ( Figure 1F ). endu-2(\u00c0) worms, however, did not show increased sensitivity to UV treatment ( Figure S1G ), which supports the notion that endu-2(\u00c0) does not cause general sickness.

This defect was significantly enhanced in NT-treated worms. When endu-2(\u00c0) worms were supplemented with 100 mM cytidine, nearly 60% of the worms showed the DNA bridge defect ( Figure 1H ). The DNA bridge defects were also slightly enhanced in endu-2(\u00c0) worms treated with HU (Figure 1H ). The occurrence of DNA bridges is an indicator of chromosomal damage and has been shown to be caused by mutations in DNA damage response genes in C. elegans (Kalogeropoulos et al., 2004; Kniazeva and Ruvkun, 2019) . Our results suggest that ENDU-2 is necessary for successful mitosis in many intestinal cells, which is consistent with a role for ENDU-2 in the DNA damage response.",

The endu-2(\u00c0) mutation significantly restored the dTTP:dCTP ratio in the cddko background (Figure 2A ), suggesting that ENDU-2 affects pyrimidine metabolism, which may be largely responsible for the suppression of sterility. In contrast, the endu-2(\u00c0) single mutant did not cause a significant change in the dTTP:dCTP ratio ( Figure S2A ), suggesting that ENDU-2 significantly affects relevant NT metabolic pathways only when NT metabolism is disturbed. To identify factors that act downstream of ENDU-2 to mediate its role in regulating pyrimidine metabolism, we carried out a candidate RNAi screen of pyrimidine metabolism genes (Figure S2B) and discovered a genetic interaction between endu-2 and ctps-1. ctps-1 encodes a homolog of CTPS that catalyzes the conversion of uridine triphosphate (UTP) to CTP ( Figure S2B ). CTPS has critical roles in NT metabolism (see Discussion). When WT worms were treated with ctps-1 RNAi, they showed a strong ''germless'' phenotype (>93%; Figures 2B and 2C ). These ''germless'' worms were sterile, with very small germlines that contained a few undifferentiated germ cells ( Figure 2B ). Reducing the strength of RNAi by diluting ctps-1(RNAi) 5fold with control (HT115) RNAi bacteria led to a reduction in the percentage of germless worms ($50%; Figure 2C ). The endu-2(\u00c0) mutation enhanced the phenotype by diluted ctps-1(RNAi) as ctps-1(RNAi); endu-2(\u00c0) worms produced a higher percentage of germless worms than that caused by ctps-1(RNAi) alone. Conversely, endu-2 overexpression (oe) had a suppression effect on diluted ctps-1(RNAi), as ctps-1(RNAi); endu-2(oe) worms produced lower percentages of germless worms than that caused by ctps-1(RNAi) alone ( Figure 2C ). These data, including the similarity in loss-of-function phenotypes and phenotype enhancements, suggest that endu-2 and ctps-1 may act either in the same pathway or in parallel pathways to affect germline development and genotoxic responses.",

            "text": "Whole-worm immunostaining demonstrated that CTPS-1 is expressed predominantly in the intestine and germline ( Figures  3D and S3A ). This observation raised an important question: in which of these two tissues is CTPS-1 modified? We treated endu-2(\u00c0) worms with glp-1(RNAi) to eliminate the germline and found that endu-2(\u00c0); glp-1(RNAi) worms only produced the larger-molecular-weight band ( Figure 3C ), indicating that the modification of CTPS-1 likely occurs in the intestine. Similar results were obtained when we tested endu-2(\u00c0); glp-1(e2141) double-mutant worms ( Figure S3D ) (Kodoyianni et al., 1992) . Given that endu-2 is strongly expressed in the intestine but not in the germline ( Figure 1B ), ENDU-2 likely represses the CTPS-1 modification locally in the intestine. To characterize the endu-2-dependent modification of CTPS-1, we pulled down CTPS-1 proteins from WT endu-2(\u00c0); glp-1(RNAi) worms and endu-2(oe) worms and subjected the samples to mass spectrometry analysis. The search for posttranslational modifications identified phosphorylations but not acetylation or ubiquitination of CTPS-1 ( Figure S3B ). Among the 3 identified phosphorylation sites, only phosphorylation of S532 was clearly repressed by the ENDU-2 activity ( Figure S3B ). Furthermore, we created the ''phospho-dead'' form of CTPS-1 in endu-2(\u00c0) mutants by introducing an S532A mutation. This mutation was found to suppress the hypersensitivity of endu-2(\u00c0) to HU treatment ( Figure 3E ) and the increased incidence of DNA bridges in endu-2(\u00c0) ( Figure S3C ), supporting the idea that the phosphorylation of CTPS-1 at S532 largely mediates the function of ENDU-2. Because endu-2(\u00c0) worms have phenotypes similar to those of ctps-1(RNAi) (suppression of cddko germline defects, hypersensitive to HU treatment, and increased number of intestine DNA bridges) (Figures 1 and 2) , the above data suggest that ENDU-2 may regulate CTPS-1 by repressing CTPS-1 phosphorylation, which in turn represses the CTPS activity ( Figure 3F ).",

In line with the local effect of ENDU-2, expressing dominant-negative PKA (Wang and Sieburth, 2013) specifically in the intestine, led to a significant reduction in CTPS-1 phosphorylation ( Figure 4B ).",

ATGL-1 is a direct target of intestinal PKA, and an atgl-1::gfp reporter strain has been used previously as a reporter of intestinal PKA activity . We treated the atgl-1::gfp reporter strain with endu-2 RNAi and observed a significant increase in GFP fluorescence in the intestine ( Figures 4C and S4C) , supporting the fact that intestine PKA activity is increased in endu-2(\u00c0) mutants. The PKA pathway is known to be activated by an increased cytosolic cyclic AMP (cAMP) level (Sassone-Corsi, 2012). We found that the overall cAMP level was modestly but significantly increased in endu-2(\u00c0) worms ( Figure 4D ). It is likely that the increase in cAMP level in the intestine of endu-2(\u00c0) worms is much larger than the observed overall cAMP level change, since our data presented earlier (e.g., Figures 1A and  4A ) suggest that ENDU-2 acts in the intestine for CTPS-1 phosphorylation and the roles on NT metabolism. cAMP is synthesized by adenylyl cyclases (acy genes) (Sassone-Corsi, 2012). C. elegans has 4 acy genes, acy-1-acy4, and knocking down any acy gene in the endu-2(\u00c0) background leads to reduced CTPS-1 phosphorylation ( Figure 4E ). The expression of all 4 genes was increased in endu-2(\u00c0), but only changes in acy-1 and acy-2 were statistically significant (Figure 4F ). It is important to note that all 4 genes are expressed in multiple tissues and that their expression levels in the intestine are weak (Govindan et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2012) . Therefore, the effect of ENDU-2 on any of these acy genes specifically in the intestine could be significantly stronger than the difference shown in Figure 4F . Our data support the model in which ENDU-2 represses the phosphorylation of CTPS-1 at least in part by repressing PKA activity in the intestine, and the latter may be achieved at least partly through repressing the expression of acy genes and cAMP level change in the intestine.",

The elimination of dividing cells using a glp-1 loss-of-function induction of endu-2 by HU ( Figure 6E ), suggesting that the endu-2 response requires cell division in adults. chk-1 is required for replication checkpoint activation in early embryos and in the germline. chk-1 RNAi also induces DNA bridge formation (Kalogeropoulos et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2010) . chk-1 RNAi abolished the endu-2 mRNA response to HU in adults but not in larvae ( Figure 6F ), suggesting that endu-2 is induced by HU through replication checkpoint activation in the germline in adults. It is important to note that endu-2 is not expressed in the germline. Therefore, the signal from checkpoint activation in the germline needs to be relayed to the intestine. endu-2 induction in larvae by HU was not affected by eliminating the germline or by chk-1 RNAi ( Figures 6E and 6F) , which is consistent with the transcriptional silencing of checkpoint signaling genes, including chk-1, in the majority of somatic cells (Vermezovic et al., 2012) . In this case, endu-2 may be induced by HU through checkpoint-independent pathways or by NT level changes directly. To further examine the relations between endu-2 and ctps-1, we also tested the mRNA level of endu-2 in ctps-1(S532A) animals treated with HU. We found that abolishing CTPS-1 phosphorylation by the ctps-1(S532A) mutation did not affect the induction of endu-2 expression by HU ( Figure S5A ), which is consistent with the proposal that ctps-1 works downstream of endu-2.",

We examined the EndoU mRNA level and found that it was significantly increased after HU treatment in HeLa cells ( Figure 6G ), indicating that the expression of this enzyme is also induced by genotoxic stresses in mammalian cells.

Besides the suppression of the germline proliferation defect in cddko animals with low pyrimidine levels, the endu-2(\u00c0) mutation alone causes defects in chromosome segregation during mitosis in the intestine. In addition, endu-2(\u00c0) worms showed growth delay when fed high levels of NTs and have increased sensitivity to the genotoxic drugs HU, 5FU, and FUDR, but not to UV radiation. Like the C. elegans ortholog, human EndoU is induced by HU treatment, and knockdown of EndoU in HeLa cells renders them hypersensitive to 5FU and FUDR. These results suggest a prominent and conserved role of this endonuclease in the genotoxic stress response.",

            "text": "EndoU is a family of Ca 2+ -dependent endoribonucleases that is conserved across phyla. The RNA-binding and endoribonuclease activities of EndoU family members were first shown in Xenopus by in vitro assays (Laneve et al., 2003; Renzi et al., 2006) and have since been confirmed in diverse organisms ranging from bacteria to humans (Ivanov et al., 2004; Laneve et al., 2008 Laneve et al., , 2017 Michalska et al., 2018; Poe et al., 2014; Schwarz and Blower, 2014; Ujisawa et al., 2018) . EndoU family members appear to be involved in many aspects of biology, including small nucleolar RNA biogenesis (Renzi et al., 2006) , endoplasmic reticulum (ER) network formation (Schwarz and Blower, 2014) , immune response (Poe et al., 2014) , neurodegeneration (Laneve et al., 2017) , and viral replication (Ivanov et al., 2004) , and as antibacterial toxins (Michalska et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2011) . Human EndoU, also known as PP11 (placental protein 11), has been suggested to be a tumor marker because it is expressed in various tumors despite having no detectable expression in tissues other than the placenta (Laneve et al., 2008) . In C. elegans, endu-2 has been shown to be one of many genes that alter expression in response to pathogen attack (Shapira et al., 2006) and play a role in the cold stress response (Ujisawa et al., 2018) . Our results not only reveal a previously unknown role of EndoU in NT sensing and response but also provide mechanistic insights for such a specific function. Cell Reports 30, 1848-1861, February 11, 2020 1857 ENDU-2 Regulates Germline Proliferation in Response to NT Levels NT balance is critical for genome integrity, and maintaining a healthy NT pool is crucial for reproductive success. We have shown previously that C. elegans actively shuts down germ cell proliferation by altering the GLP-1/Notch pathway in cddko mutant animals with a diminishing pyrimidine level . Here, we show that the loss of ENDU-2 function suppresses the germline shutdown by restoring the balance, indicating that the expression of ENDU-2 critically facilitates the shutdown of germ cell proliferation by preventing the changes that occurred in endu-2(\u00c0) mutants. Therefore, ENDU-2 appears to act as a safeguard for healthy germline development by sensing the NT pool and other genotoxic stresses that threaten reproductive success. Under these suboptimal conditions, endu-2 is induced, as we have shown, to shut down germline development to prevent damage and preserve resources for when the aversive condition improves ( Figure 6I ). Critically, as we have shown, the function of ENDU-2 is partially mediated by histone deacetylase-1 (HDA-1), which has been shown to affect germline development via the GLP-1/Notch pathway (Dufourcq et al., 2002) , establishing a direct connection between NT sensing and germline development.",

CTPS activity is elevated in various cancers (Kizaki et al., 1980; van den Berg et al., 1993; Williams et al., 1978) and is an attractive target for the development of antineoplastic, antiviral, and antiparasitic drugs (Hofer et al., 2001; Jordheim et al., 2013; Schimmel et al., 2007) and immunosuppressants (Martin et al., 2014) . CTPS activity is regulated through interactions with all 4 ribonucleotide triphosphates, including the inhibition by its product CTP. CTPS exists as inactive dimers and forms tetramers when activated (Endrizzi et al., 2004) .There are 2 isoforms of CTPS in humans, CTPS1 and CTPS2. Both isoforms are regulated by phosphorylation (Chang et al., 2007; Han et al., 2005; Higgins et al., 2007; Kassel et al., 2010) , but it is unknown whether and how the phosphorylation of CTPS is involved in the cellular stress response, especially in response to altered NT profiles. Previous studies have also found that CTPS can form large filamentous structures called cytoophidia in cells in various organisms, which is known to modulate CTPS activity and stability (Liu, 2016; Lynch et al., 2017) . In addition, CTPS phosphorylation may affect the ability to form cytoophidia. The significance of forming cytoophidia regarding specific physiological functions remains to be investigated.",

We have also shown that ENDU-2 exerts its regulation on CTPS-1 through the PKA pathway and HDA-1. However, our results do not rule out additional pathways. In our proposed model ( Figure 6I ), under NT deprivation or other genotoxic stress, elevated ENDU-2 activity represses CTPS-1 phosphorylation, which then contributes to the stoppage of germline proliferation, at least in part, by increased repressive activity of non-phosphorylated CTPS-1, although we have no evidence to exclude the contribution of reducing the activity of phosphorylated CTPS-1. While additional studies are needed to reach a firm conclusion regarding the role of CTPS-1 phosphorylation, the proposed model is supported by the data mentioned above. Several critical mechanistic questions remain to be addressed before creating a more comprehensive model for ENDU-2-mediated regulation of NT metabolism and germline development in response to NT deprivation or imbalance. First, identification of the direct targets of ENDU-2 is a critical step toward understanding how this endonuclease controls the activities of CTPS-1 and other downstream factors. Second, how CTPS-1 phosphorylation affects its enzymatic activity and how CTPS-1 activity in the intestine ultimately affects germline development remain attractive problems to tackle. Finally, how ENDU-2 expression and activity in the intestine is altered by changes in NT levels is potentially a critical question to investigate toward understanding the initial NT ''sensing'' mechanism.",

As mentioned above, there are 2 isoforms of CTPS in humans, CTPS1 and CTPS2, and both isoforms are regulated by phosphorylation. Specifically, CTPS1 is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase 3 and CTPS2 by casein kinase 1, in which both phosphorylation events inhibit enzyme activity (Higgins et al., 2007; Kassel et al., 2010) . There is evidence that PKA and protein kinase C (PKC) may also phosphorylate CTPS1, but the results are contradictory and the site of action of PKA is unknown (Chang et al., 2007; Han et al., 2005; Higgins et al., 2007) . Our data indicate that C. elegans CTPS-1 undergoes PKA-mediated phosphorylation that inhibits the enzyme activity, suggesting that this regulation by PKA is likely conserved between worms and humans, although the predicted phosphorylation site S532 is not conserved in human CTPS genes.",

Studying the mechanism of the impact of NTs on germline proliferation may thus provide insight into the drug-resistance mechanism in cancer cells. Human EndoU is a tumor marker, as the protein expression is below the detection level outside the placenta but is present in several tumor tissues (Laneve et al., 2008) . Consistent with its potential function in carcinogenesis, we show that C. elegans endu-2 is responsive to genotoxic stress and is important for successful mitosis in the intestine. At least some of the functions are likely conserved in humans, as we have shown that human EndoU is also induced by HU treatment, and knocking down EndoU rendered HeLa cells hypersensitive to 5-FU and FUDR, both of which are widely used chemotherapy drugs. It is important to note that EndoU RNAi alone does not affect cell viability, and a mouse strain containing a homozygous EndoU deletion is viable (Dickinson et al., 2016) . EndoU is a potential target with low toxicity and known lead drugs to enhance the efficiency of chemotherapy drugs 5-FU and FUDR. A previous screen has already identified small molecules that inhibit EndoU activity in the micromolar range (Ragno et al., 2011) .",
