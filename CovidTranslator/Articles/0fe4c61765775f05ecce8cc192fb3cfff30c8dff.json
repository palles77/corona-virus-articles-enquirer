Hence, these epitopes could be useful for diagnosis and as vaccine constituents. Using the phage-displayed peptide library screening method and purified Fab fragments of immunoglobulin G (IgG Fab) from normal human sera and convalescent sera from SARS-CoV-infected patients as targets, 11 B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (S protein) and membrane protein (M protein) were screened. After a bioinformatics tool was used to analyze these epitopes, four epitope-based S protein dodecapeptides corresponding to the predominant epitopes were chosen for synthesis. Their antigenic specificities and immunogenicities were studied in vitro and in vivo. Flow cytometry and ELISPOT analysis of lymphocytes as well as a serologic analysis of antibody showed that these peptides could trigger a rapid, highly effective, and relatively safe immune response in BALB/c mice. These findings might aid development of SARS diagnostics and vaccines. Moreover, the role of S and M proteins as important surface antigens is confirmed.",

Therefore, in the present study, we screened and identified specific B cell epitopes of SARS-CoV using phagedisplayed peptide library, Fab fragments from anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and normal human IgG as targets, and an improved biopanning procedure.

Of 60 selected phage clones, 43 (72%) immunopositive clones had significant enhancement of binding activity to SARS-CoV-specific antibodies but not to normal human serum (Fig. 1) . The homology between peptide sequences of a series of epitopes inserted into target phages and the primary sequence of the structural protein of SARS-CoV was compared ( Table 1 ). As seen in Table 1 , the double selection process resulted in 12 different peptides, which could be divided into three groups: (1) nine peptides with homology to nine different regions of the SARS-CoV S protein; (2) two peptides with homology to two regions of the M protein; and (3) one peptide without any homology to the SARS-CoV structural proteins. Some peptides showed a striking resemblance (as its peptide sequence SHVPLATSRTLA contained six matches to the M protein sequence) and were isolated more than once (SHVPLATSRTLA was sequenced five times, Group 2 in Table  1 ). The majority of epitopes were isolated after both screens.",

To prove that the phage-borne peptides were the real epitopes of SARS-CoV, a peptide competitiveinhibition assay was performed to determine whether the synthetic peptide and the corresponding phage clone competed for the same antibody-binding site. In competitive-inhibition assay, the peptides dose-dependently blocked the binding of the corresponding phage clones to the targets (Fig. 2) . Moreover, the four peptides reacted with SARS-CoV-specific serum antibody and did not cross-react with anti-HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 sera or healthy donor sera (Fig. 3 ).",

Identification of specific phage clones reactive with anti-SARS-CoV serum by ELISA. 1-30 represent the ELISA results reacted between different phage clones selected by immunoscreen and patient serum mixture/normal human serum mixture. 31 represent the results between wild type phages as negative control and serum samples above. After four rounds of biopanning twice, 43 phage clones from 60 selected phage clones were significantly reactive with anti-SARS-CoV serum, but not with normal human serum. A and B represent respectively the immune reactivity of phage clones picked at random from the first and the second time that phage cloning was carried out. The negative control reacted with neither patient serum mixture nor normal human serum mixture. the ratio of CD4 + T cell/CD8 + T cell was a little higher. However, the increase in CD4 + T cell/CD8 + T cell ratio was similar in the control group and all MAP-immunized groups, except the MAP2-immunized group on day 14. It suggested that these epitope-based peptides did not imbalance the immunological system. Subsequently, with the activation of T cells, the T cell/B cell ratio progressively returned to a normal level in all groups except the MAP2-immunized group at a low level. The results demonstrated that humoral immune response was predominant and was rapidly triggered by the epitope-based peptide, especially by MAP2.",

These data demonstrate that the four B cell epitopes were more effective enhancers of humoral immunity than cellular immunity. The results of antigenspecific lymphocyte cell proliferation assay indicated that each MAP dose-dependently stimulated a proliferative response and MAP3 was the most effective inducer of lymphocyte proliferation (Table 3) .

We were successful in screening with polyclonal antisera using this technique, probably because of the newly improved biopanning we adopted and the targets we chose. Anti-SARS-CoV serum contains mostly SARS-CoV antibodies and few antibodies to other pathogens. In conventional biopanning processes with anti-SARS-CoV sera as the only targets, nonspecific phage clones that do not bind to SARS-CoV-specific immunoglobulins but instead to antibodies specific to other pathogens might be amplified. In addition, some researchers reported that nonspecific clones not binding to the target but to the plastic of plate could also be chosen in several conventional biopanning procedures (Adey et al., 1995) . We improved the biopanning procedure to avoid these possibilities and ensure specificity of selection. Anti-SARS-CoV IgG Fab (as the simplest fragments with specificity of antibodies) facilitated the antigen specificity of our biopanning procedure.",

Moreover, we found another peptide sequence displayed by an immunopositive phage clone without homology to any primary sequence of SARS-CoV proteins. The structure of epitopes recognized and bound by B cell receptor (BCR) was shown to be linear or spatial by the classical experiments of Michael Sela 30 years ago (Sela, 1969) . Phagedisplayed peptide libraries are generated by shotgun cloning of random oligonucleotides into the 5\u2032 ends of either the pIII or pVIII genes of filamentous phage. The peptides encoded by inserted nucleotides are displayed on the phage surface and have independent spatial structure (Cwirla et al., 1990; Luzzago et al., 1993) . So the non-homologous peptide sequence might reflect the presence of a discontinuous epitope of SARS-CoV. In addition, SARS-CoV is antigenically crossreactive with other viruses, so the non-homologous peptide sequence might be also an epitope of a different virus. Certainly, this finding must be studied further. Among the linear epitopes, nine (81%) were considered to be S protein epitopes (five epitopes in S1 protein and four in S2 protein) and two (18%), M protein epitopes. The decrement tendency of numbers of epitopes of S1 protein, S2 protein, and M protein connected with the location of these proteins in the virion. Most (60%) of the epitopes were located in regions where predicted epitopes were known to exist, and a minority (24%) of epitopes were located about 6\u221213 amino acids away from the predicted epitope regions (Yuxian et al., 2005; Yanbo et al., 2003 Yanbo et al., , 2004 . And two were located in regions where the virus binds to the host cell receptor (ACE-II) .",

            "text": "The immunological effect of epitope-based peptides was studied. The lymphocyte proliferation assay showed the four epitope-based peptides stimulated the immune system. Secretion of IL-4 (a B cell growth and differentiation factor) might reflect the state of activation and proliferation of B cells and transition to antibody-producing plasma cells. The increase was dramatically greater in the number of IL-4-producing cells than in the number of IFN-\u03b3-producing cells after immunization with these epitope-based peptides, confirming that humoral immunity was predominant. So, the epitopes we selected are real B cell epitopes. The specific antibody induced by the four epitopes persisted at least 6 weeks, which was confirmed by monitoring IgG titer. Although specific IgG could be detected after primary immunization, persistent high titer IgG required revaccination. It indicated the involvement of humoral immune memory. Within 1 week after revaccination, B cell numbers peaked, which indirectly proved that antigen-specific memory B cells could be induced by these epitope peptides. It suggested that Lymphocytes were from the mice immunized with the four different peptides on 14 days, 21 days, and 35 days after primary immunization (n = 5). Results are means \u00b1 SD. a P value < 0.01 compared with the control group. b P value < 0.05 compared with the control group. Fig. 6 . Three-color flow cytometric analysis of surface markers (CD44 and CD62L) expression on CD4 + T cells isolated from the spleens of immune mice before (on day 0) and after (on days 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) the third immunization with MAP1-4. Gates were set on the CD4 + T cells. The experiment was repeated three times with the same overall results. The values within each box indicate the relative cell number. these epitopes were potential for development of SARS vaccine. MAP2 and MAP4 induced rapid increase in the number of IL-4-producing cells to enhance the humoral immune indicated their potential uses for emergent prophylaxis of SARS; MAP1 and MAP3 induced relatively slow but persistent increase in that to enhance humoral immune indicated their potential uses for long-term prophylaxis of SARS. Since activated Th (CD4 + T) cells are also needed for effective humoral immunity, Th cells will be activated rapidly with the help of immune memory. In the mice, CD62L (Bradley et al., 1992; Yin et al., 1991) and CD44 (Budd et al., 1987; Butterfield et al., 1989 ) are used to distinguish naive from memory cells, and naive from activated T cells (Gerberick et al., 1997) . In our study, in epitope-based peptide-immunized mice, the classical phenotype of immunologic memory (CD44 high , and L-selectin low ) was present on the surface of CD4 + T lymphocytes just before the third immunization (day 0), suggesting that these epitope-based peptides could enhance the CD4 + T memory cell response and thereby increase immune surveillance, defense, and capacity to carry out their auxiliary functions when specific antigen reappeared.",
