            "text": "In this work, we analyze the epidemic data of cumulative infected cases collected from many countries as reported by WHO starting from January 21 st 2020 and up till March 21 st 2020. Our inspection is motivated by the renormalization group (RG) framework. Here we propose the RGinspired logistic function of the form \u03b1E(t) = a 1 + e \u2212c(t\u2212t 0 ) \u2212n as an epidemic strength function with n being asymmetry in the modified logistic function. We perform the non-linear least-squares analysis with data from various countries. The uncertainty for model parameters is computed using the squared root of the corresponding diagonal components of the covariance matrix. We carefully divide countries under consideration into 2 categories based on the estimation of the inflection point: the maturing phase and the growth-dominated phase. We observe that long-term estimations of cumulative infected cases of countries in the maturing phase for both n = 1 and n = 1 are close to each other. We find from the value of root mean squared error (RMSE) that the RG-inspired logistic model with n = 1 is slightly preferable in this category. We also argue that n determines the characteristic of the epidemic at an early stage. However, in the second category, the estimated asymptotic number of cumulative infected cases contain rather large uncertainty. Therefore, in the growth-dominated phase, we focus on using n = 1 for countries in this phase. Some of them are in an early stage of an epidemic with an insufficient amount of data leading to a large uncertainty on parameter fits. In terms of the accuracy of the size estimation, the results do strongly depend on limitations on data collection and the epidemic phase for each country.",

Since the first reports of COVID-19, there are various attempts to estimate the final size of the spread mathematically. Among several approaches [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , the logistic growth models are very popular and useful to predict the final size of the epidemic [10, 11] . It is worth noting that the logistic function or logistic curve is a common \"S\" shape (Sigmoid curve). Logistic functions are often used in statistics and machine learning, medicine, chemistry, physics, material science, linguistics, and even agriculture. However its root somehow seems to be coincidentally originated from the high energy physics and condense matter physics' point of view. In terms of the renormalisation group (RG) framework, we define the logistic growth function as an epidemic strength function allowing us to describe the spread of disease. Its derivative with respect to time yields a new quantity which can be interpreted as the beta function of an underlying microscopic model. This frame work was first proposed in Ref. [12] to describe the underlying dynamics of disease spread by invoking the usual logistic-growth model.",

The next stage of growth is approximately exponential, then as saturation begins, the growth slows down to linear, and at maturity, the growth stops. Similar behaviour happens in various phenomena in physics, for example, the running coupling constants of particular theories describing phase transitions in high energy physics and in condensed matter physics. The renormalization group (RG) method is a successful framework, and is widely used to describe the dynamics of mentioned phenomena [13, 14] .

Moreover, the function \u03b1 E has many interesting features and it can be reduced to several useful function in physics such as Fermi-Dirac distributions [15] or running coupling constant of the four-fermion contact interaction [16] for n = 1 and the generalized Woods-Saxson nuclear potential [17] for n = 2 as well as the Starobinsky inflation potential [18] for n = \u22122. Turning to the crucial part of this section, we will derive the beta function of epidemic strength coupling with the RG technique in the following and demonstrate how COVID-19 spread underlying the RG flow description. It is well known that the evolution of the \u03b1 E (t) function is governed by the beta function. In the present work, we use t as a time of the evolution of the system instead of energy in high energy physics. The time scale in our work is related to the typical energy scale as t = ln \u00b5 0 /\u00b5 in the standard RG approach where \u00b5 0 and \u00b5 are the energy scale limit of our interested and the running energy scale, respectively.
