Respiratory mucus is a hostile environment for respiratory viruses for the following reasons:",

Contains bacteria and fungi which may influence the environment around the viruses in the mucus Studies on the persistence of viruses on surfaces do not use respiratory mucus as the vehicle to study the virus but usually culture the virus from a sputum sample and then apply the virus in culture medium to the surface to be studied.",

However, in this study the authors comment that the presence of mucus caused a rapid decline in the concentration of infectious virus, (a 10 2 reduction in only 2 hours). It is also important to note that the ability of a virus sample to infect a culture medium needs only a single virus whereas larger numbers of virus are needed to initiate an infection of the human airway due to the presence of mucus and mucociliary clearance defenses etc.",
