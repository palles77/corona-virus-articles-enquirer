However, there are limited data on the molecular epidemiology of the HRV types involved. Objectives: To determine whether a large respiratory outbreak in a LTCH was caused by a single type of HRV, and to describe the clinical impact of the outbreak. Study design: Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from residents with one or more of the following: fever, cough, rhinitis, or congestion. Specimens were interrogated by multiplex PCR using the ResPlex II assay. Samples positive for HRV were then submitted for genotyping by partial sequence analysis of the 5 untranslated (UTR) and viral protein (VP) 1 capsid regions. Results: Of 71 screened, 56 residents were positive for a HRV during an outbreak that lasted 5.5 weeks; 27 healthcare workers also had respiratory symptoms. Three residents were transferred to hospital and 2 died. Seven units in two wings of the LTCH were affected, resulting in 3152.5 resident unit closure days. Three different HRV genotypes were identified, although HRV-A1 dominated. Conclusions: This large outbreak of HRVs among residents and healthcare workers in a LTCH was associated with substantial resident and staff morbidity as well as significant unit closures. Multiple types of HRV were implicated but an HRV-A1 type dominated, warranting further investigation into viral determinants for virulence and transmission.",

In addition, HRVs have been implicated in severe lower respiratory tract disease, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia [11] [12] [13] [14] . In recent years, important insights have been gained into the diversity of rhinoviruses and the spectrum of disease they cause [15] [16] [17] [18] . Currently, there are 3 recognized species of HRVs: A, B and C, and these include approximately 100 prototypic genotypes. Viruses within this group were also classified based upon host receptor binding-Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM)-1 (major group) vs. low density lipoprotein (LDL, minor group)-and reactivity to capsid-binding antiviral compounds types 1(A) vs. 2(B) [19] [20] [21] [22] . Diversity is attributed in part to the error rate of the viral RNA polymerase which is estimated at 3.4 \u00d7 10 \u22124 errors/nucleotide/cycle over the entire open reading frame [23] . Recombination resulting in new types has also been described [24, 25] .",

In contrast, partial sequence analysis of viruses revealed single types were responsible for LTCH outbreaks reported in the literature [6, 8, 32] . Among household members, multiple types of HRVs have been shown to co-circulate simultaneously [30] . This is the first study we are aware of where multiple HRV genotypes have been implicated in a LTCH outbreak. VP1 region sequencing provided better resolution and was able to genotype 3 HRVs which were only identified to the species level by 5 UTR sequencing. Recombination cannot be ruled out in the case of the type identified as a species B by 5 UTR analysis without further sequencing. In this outbreak, genotyping also revealed the dominant type was a HRV-A1, which is a minor receptor binding and antiviral group 2 reactive type. With respect to pathogenicity, HRVs species A and C have been implicated more in clinical disease and severity compared to species B [17, 26, 27, 36] . In addition, it has been proposed that HRV types possessing type 2 (or B) antiviral binding sites may cause more clinical disease [21] . The mean viral loads of a subset of samples from this outbreak were comparable to those of children and university students; these data have been published elsewhere [37] .",

            "text": "Genotyping also revealed aspects of transmission dynamics which would have otherwise been overlooked. The HRV 21-like virus circulated early in the outbreak among residents on units where the general level of activity tends to be lower. Thus, residents infected with HRV-A21 virus may have been more likely to remain on their units, limiting the spread of this type. The more extensive spread of HRV-A1 may have been due to host characteristics such as level of activity, as opposed to a viral fitness advantage. Unfortunately, there are no animal models in which to study transmission dynamics and compare dispersion fitness of HRVs. At this point it is not known whether HRV genotypes differ with respect to transmission efficiency or optimal mode of transmission. Past human experimental work and epidemiological studies suggest that fomites and droplet aerosols are routes for transmission of HRVs, though there are conflicting data regarding the contribution of fomites to transmission [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Of note, effective transmission may not be linked to a highly virulent phenotype [43] , since less symptomatic hosts are more likely to interact with susceptibles, facilitating dispersion. We speculate this may partially explain the extent of this outbreak in this highly vulnerable population. It is important to also consider the possibility that patients with cognitive impairment may not observe infection control precautions to the same extent as other residents, potentially facilitating the spread of the virus. Finally, it is well-recognized that HRVs frequently infect HCWs [44] and HCWs have been implicated in the spread of HRVs in other settings such as a neonatal intensive care unit [45] . Infected HCWs circulating between units and wings may account for the rapid and widespread dispersion of the HRV-A1 type, underscoring the importance for HCWs to observe healthy workplace policies and remain at home when unwell.",

Number of laboratoryconfirmed HRV-infected residents by HRV type and ill staff (data available for 21 staff who reported a respiratory illness) by day during the outbreak. NP swabs were not obtained from staff, thus no sequencing is available for those cases.were used in a 25 l reaction: 1X of 10X PCR Buffer, 200 M of each dNTP, 0.5 M forward and reverse primer, and 2.5 units of HotStar-Taq DNA polymerase. External PCR cycling conditions on the PTC 200 Thermocycler (MJ Research) were as follows: 95 \u2022 C for 15 min, 40 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, 50 \u2022 C for 30 s, and 72 \u2022 C for 30 s with a final extension of 72 \u2022 C for 5 min.Five microlitres of the first PCR product were subjected to two separate internal amplifications using A forward, C forward primers and an identical A/C reverse primer. Five microlitres of the B external reaction was subjected to an internal amplification with B-specific primers. The second PCRs were performed under the same conditions as stated above except for an annealing temperature of 55 \u2022 C. Amplified product was resolved on a 2% agarose gel and purified using Purelink \u00ae PCR Purification kit (Life Technologies). Sequencing of approximately 340 base pairs was performed in both directions using the internal primers at the Institute for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (MOBIX), McMaster University, Hamilton, ON using ABI BigDye terminator chemistry, on a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems).",
