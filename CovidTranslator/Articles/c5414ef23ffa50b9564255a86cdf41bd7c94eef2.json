At least one enteropathogen was identified in 53.3 % of piglets and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC; 25.6 %) was the major pathogen; mostly STa + /STb + or F4 + /STa + /STb + ETEC were isolated. The overall occurrence of the rest of pathogens was 10 % for transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and Cryptosporidium parvum, 6.7 % for rotavirus A and Isospora suis, 5.6 % for \u03b1-toxigenic Clostridium perfringens, 3.3 % for verotoxigenic E. coli (VTEC), and 2.2 % for Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Newport. TGEV and \u03b1-toxigenic C. perfringens were only identified in suckling piglets, while Salmonella Newport and VTEC were only detected in weaned pigs. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), \u03b2-toxigenic C. perfringens, Eimeria spp., and helminths were not identified. Eight kinds of mixed infections were detected in 25 % of enteropathogen positive piglets. ETEC was present in 10 of 12 mixed infections, and TGEV infections were never combined. This survey demonstrates that several enteropathogens are circulating in piggeries located in the province of Villa Clara in Cuba, and that is necessary to improve surveillance, prevention, and control of enteric infections in order to increase production efficiency.",

However, there is scarce information on the epidemiology of enteropathogens because in most of the diarrhea outbreaks diagnosis is restricted to clinical and macro-pathological examinations (Cabrera and Garc\u00eda 2009) , which are tentative rather than specific diagnosis tools (Elicker et al. 2010) . Also, limited research on porcine enteropathogens has been performed during the last 20 years in Cuban piggeries (Fuentes et al. 2001 ; Barrera et al. 2005; Blanco et al. 2006) .",

The herd of the 6 piggeries together comprised 5,252 sows and 7,455 suckling piglets; the number of newly weaned piglets was not specifically controlled on the herd book. All piggeries followed a similar continuous flow management (farrow-to-finish) without straw bedding; they had similar facilities, used the same antibiotics, and shared breeding stock animals routinely. Pregnant sows were housed individually, and at the end of gestation, they were moved up to elevated farrowing crates with completely perforated plastic flooring.

In 2005, 1,980,000 pigs were slaughtered and 5 years later already 3,266,600 (O.N.E. 2011). Recently, the vice-director of the Cuban National Institute of Veterinary Medicine recommended an improvement on swine management and on the diagnosis of enteric diseases in order to decrease mortality due to diarrhea in young pigs (Ricardo 2008) . In this survey, 25.6 % of piglets was infected by ETEC which was the most common enteropathogen. In Cuban piggeries, vaccination against ETEC is not applied and enteropathogenic E. coli is resistant to most of the routinely administered antibiotics (de la F\u00e9 Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2012) . For Cuba, this study is the first that demonstrates ST encoding genes in F4 + , F5 + , and F41 + ETEC as previously these fimbriae were not identified (Blanco et al. 2006) ; also, is the first to report F18 + /LT + /STb + ETEC corresponding with findings in USA (Zhang et al. 2007 ). The LT encoding gene was not commonly detected; nevertheless, most of ETEC carried ST encoding genes, which are sufficient for causing diarrhea in young pigs (Erume et al. 2008) . All F4 + ETEC were negative for LT; in contrast, a strong association between F4 and LT was reported by Zhang et al. (2007) .",
