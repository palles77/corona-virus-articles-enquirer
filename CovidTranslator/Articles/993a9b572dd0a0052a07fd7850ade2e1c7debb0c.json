Previous studies show that transmission of H3N2, 2009 H1N1, and other strains of influenza are sensitive to environmental conditions, and in particular decline with higher temperatures and humidity. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] If COVID-19 exhibits similar climatic sensitivities, it is possible that warmer temperatures during the boreal summer months may lower transmission rates for Northern Hemisphere countries while cooler temperatures increase transmission rates for Southern Hemisphere countries over the same period. Such climatic determinants of transmission present opportunities and challenges for policymakers and scientists, as seasonal changes both open windows of opportunity to constrain the spread of the virus, while also accelerating rates of transmission in locations where stringent public health measures have not yet been put in place.",

However, to date, results from existing studies compare temperature and COVID-19 cases across countries or across regions within individual countries. These empirical frameworks conflate location-specific characteristics -such as testing capacity, population density, and health services -with temperature variation. [8] [9] [10] Because temperature is correlated with many (often unobservable) confounding factors, such cross-sectional comparisons may not have a causal interpretation. [11] [12] [13] For example, countries that are cooler on average also tend to have higher income per capita 14 which may affect the number of new COVID-19 cases by enabling more public health measures such as testing and hospitalizations. Moreover, to our knowledge, prior empirical estimates of the COVID-19-temperature relationship only examine cases within China, which may not be suitable for understanding the temperature-COVID-19 relationship globally. Additionally, several studies compare temperature and COVID-19 transmission across countries, but make no attempt to estimate a statistical relationship between temperature and COVID-19 cases 15, 16 or to generate empirically-based seasonal projections.",

            "text": "We find robust statistical evidence that higher temperatures lower the number new cases of COVID-19 in a given population. In our main statistical specification, we find that a 1 \u2022 C increase in local temperature reduces new COVID-19 cases per 1 million people by 13%, with a 95% confidence interval of [-21%, -4%] ( Fig. 1B and col. 1 of Table S1 ). This result is robust to controlling for precipitation and specific humidity, neither of which exhibit statistically significant effects (although point estimates on humidity are negative, consistent with prior evidence for influenza 5 ) ( Fig. 1B and col. 2 of Table S1 ). Our findings are also robust to inclusion of a range of semi-parametric controls, including controlling for seasonal patterns of temperature that are common across countries within particular latitude bands of varying width ( Fig. 1B and cols. 4-7 of Table S1 ). In our benchmark model (col. 5 of Table  S1 ), we control for separate nonlinear trends for countries that fall within each 25 \u2022 latitude band across the globe. This model accounts for spatially-varying trends in seasonal factors that may correlate both with COVID-19 cases and with temperature. Decreasing the width of these latitudinal bands, and thus imposing more restrictive controls on spatial patterns of seasonality, yields a coefficient statistically indistinguishable from that in our benchmark model (col. 7 of Table S1 ). These estimates are proportional, implying that the level change in the COVID-19 case rate per unit change in temperature will be higher in populations where the epidemic has already taken a strong hold. In contrast, lower temperatures will lead to far fewer individuals infected in a population with a low overall case rate. However, we detect no evidence of nonlinearity in this proportional response ( Fig. 1B and col. 3 of Table S1 ); a 1 \u2022 C increase in local temperature increases the case rate by 13% on average whether a country is presently relatively cold (e.g. South Korea), or relatively warm (e.g. Australia). These estimates relate new COVID-19 cases to plausibly random daily variation in local temperatures. Thus, they reflect multiple possible channels through which changes in temperature can influence new cases. First, temperature is likely to have a biological effect on the virus 2019-nCoV itself, as has been documented in lab experiments for influenza. 3 Second, temperature may change people's behavior, and thus change the number of new cases caused by a single infected individual. For example, warming temperatures encourage outdoor activities, 17 possibly changing the intensity of social interaction. Finally, temperature has a direct effect on other causes of morbidity and mortality, with particularly large impacts on elderly populations. [18] [19] [20] [21] Thus, temperature may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 by lowering overall health.",

This result implies that upcoming seasonal temperature changes will differentially affect COVID-19 transmission across the world. Projecting our estimates onto the next 11 months of expected seasonal temperatures, we predict that countries that will experience colder conditions -primarily in the Southern Hemisphere -are likely to see an increase in COVID-19 transmission during the boreal summer months followed by a drop in transmission during the boreal winter months. Conversely, countries expecting to get warmer during boreal summer months, most of which lie above the equator, will first experience lower COVID-19 transmission before a return to higher rates of transmission. Some important exceptions to this pattern exist, such as in southern India, where an upcoming monsoonal period is likely to lower temperatures from their current levels and raise the rates of transmission, all else equal.",

For southern countries, which have generally experienced fewer COVID-19 cases to date (Fig.  1A) , public health policy must be ramped up in response to rising COVID-19 transmission as temperatures cool. Northern countries face a crucial window of opportunity to eliminate COVID-19 from their populations. In the coming warmer months, rising temperatures are likely to lower overall transmission, making large-scale public health interventions that limit contact amongst individuals, such as shelter-in-place policies and school closings, more effec-tive at achieving and maintaining low overall case rates. However, if such measures are not taken and moderate baseline levels of transmission persist through the summer, cooler fall and winter months could imply a substantial resurgence of new cases ( Fig. 2 and 3) . Getting the most from these policies during this summer period is critical if northern countries want to eliminate COVID-19, rather than experience a second, possibly stronger, second wave of the virus when temperatures fall during the winter of 2021. History hints at the importance of taking advantage of this window of opportunity: the second wave of the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic had much higher mortality rates than the first. 22, 23 Although we know of no completed laboratory studies of the temperature-COVID-19 transmission relationship to date, we view our approach as complementary to such future results. While laboratory studies isolate the biology of virus transmission, our statistical approach using observed COVID-19 cases captures those channels as well as any behavioral adjustments individuals make in response to short-term fluctuations in temperature, such as decisions to go outside, to exercise, to attend social gatherings, and many other possible activities and health investments. As public health officials grapple with the costs and benefits of a range of possible responses to the current pandemic, quantifying the influence of both channels is essential to building appropriate policies.",

It is very likely that confirmed cases of COVID-19 fall far below actual rates of infection, 24 thus suggesting that our findings may represent an under-estimate of the magnitude of the link between infection and local climatic conditions. Relatedly, countries around the world have invested very differently in testing capacity, making such under-reporting heterogeneous across space and time. However, our empirical model is designed to purge estimates of the influence of such differential testing by using a rich set of semi-parametric controls, including fixed effects that vary across both space and time. Second, the estimates we show represent average treatment effects across countries and time periods in our sample. It is possible that the effect of temperature on case rates varies across different policy regimes, such as social distancing and the closure of public transportation systems. While such heterogeneity is an important area for future research, it is important to note that our model, by construction, captures many sources of such heterogeneity through its log-linear form. While we find that temperature has a consistent -13% per 1 \u2022 C effect on the rate of new cases in a given population, this translates into very different levels of cases in different locations. If public health policies successfully lower baseline COVID-19 case rates, changing temperatures will have a much smaller effect on total cases than when baseline rates are high. 7 All rights reserved.

This study takes an econometric approach to isolate random variation in one potentially important driver of transmission, temperature. Our reduced-form empirical approach is agnostic regarding the mechanisms through which temperature influences case rates, but by providing causal estimates of the role that temperature plays in transmission, allows us to make counterfactual simulations of future conditions under alternative temperature conditions.

The estimated impacts, \u2206y i,M ar+\u03c4 represent the percent change in new COVID-19 cases between March 2020 and future month \u03c4 , holding all else equal. As described in the main text, these are proportional projections, underscoring the importance of assessing temperature's influence on COVID-19 alongside the many other factors that determine the baseline case rate at a given location and time.",

We aggregate pixel-level weather variables to the country level using population weights and link to daily country-level reports of new COVID-19 cases across the world for the period between January 22, 2020 to March 15, 2020 (see Data section of Methods). This country-by-day global longitudinal dataset enables us to statistically estimate a global function between temperature and new cases of COVID-19 per 1 million people. In particular, we leverage the large existing climate econometrics literature13 to employ a statistical model containing a suite of semi-parametric controls designed to isolate the effect of temperature from potentially confounding factors that also influence new COVID-19 cases. These controls account for: time-invariant differences in population characteristics across countries, such as differential population densities and healthcare systems; temporal shocks that influence the pattern of global COVID-19 events, such as the WHO pandemic designation; and seasonal trends that vary latitudinally across the globe. Together, these controls aim to isolate idiosyncratic daily variations in temperatures experienced by the same population; we show that results are consistent across a range of alternative statistical models, each of which varies the stringency of these controls (see Statistical Model section of Methods).",
