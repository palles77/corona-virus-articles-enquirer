Based on the structural requirements for both MHC class II binding and TCR recognition of an immunodominant myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide, criteria for a data base search were developed in which the degeneracy of amino acid side chains required for MHC class II binding and the conservation of those required for T cell activation were considered. A panel of 129 peptides that matched the molecular mimicry motif was tested on seven MBPspecific T cell clones from multiple sclerosis patients. Seven viral and one bacterial peptide efficiently activated three of these clones. Only one peptide could have been identified as a molecular mimic by sequence alignment. The observation that a single T cell receptor can recognize quite distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.",

            "text": "Activation of autoreactive T cells is a critical event in the induction of autoimmunity. In animal models of T cellmediated autoimmunity, disease can be transferred only with activated but not with resting T cells specific for a central nervous system (CNS)-specific autoantigen (reviewed by Zamvil and Steinman, 1990) . Resting autoreactive T cells are part of the normal immune repertoire and do not induce disease as the blood-brain barrier limits access to the CNS to activated T cells (Schluesener and Wekerle, 1985; Burns et al., 1983; Ota et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1990; Pette et al., 1990) . This protective mechanism makes circulating self-reactive T cells \"ignorant\" of the complex set of tissue-specific self-antigens hidden behind the blood-brain barrier. Invasion of the CNS requires autoreactive T cells to be activated in the peripheral immune system. This activation occurs in the absence of their nominal self-antigen, which is sequestered in the CNS (Wekerie et al., 1986; Hickey et al., 1991) . Two mechanisms could account for the activation and clonal expansion of autoreactive T cells in the periphery: activation by bacterial or viral superantigens that trigger T cells bearing particular T cell receptor VI~ segments (Brocke et al., 1993; Cole and Griffiths, 1993; Conrad et al., 1994) , or activation by viral or bacterial peptides that have sufficient sequence similarity with an immunodominant self-peptide (molecular mimicry) (Oldstone, 1990) .",

Particular viral infections frequently precede autoimmune myocarditis and type I diabetes (IDDM) (Rose et al., 1986; Ray et al., 1980) . Also, an inflammatory CNS disease can follow infection with a number of common viral pathogens, such as measles and rubella. The absence of virus in the CNS and reactivity to myelin basic protein (MBP) in these patients suggest an autoimmune mechanism (Johnson et al., 1984) . Environmental agents also influence the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) as demonstrated by migration studies. Individuals that migrate after age 15 carry the risk for developing MS associated with their geographic origin, while individuals who migrate earlier in life acquire the risk of the geographical region to which they migrated (Kurtzke, 1985) . These studies are consistent with the hypothesis that a group of pathogens that are relatively ubiquitous in a certain geographic region influence the risk of developing MS.",

            "text": "Recent immunological studies suggest that MBP may be one of the important target antigens in the immunopathogenesis of MS. Several studies have demonstrated that MBP-specific T cells are clonally expanded in MS patients and in an in vivo activated state (Allegretta et al., 1990; Wucherpfennig et al., 1994b; Zhang et al., 1994) . Reactivity with the immunodominant MBP(84-102) peptide is found predominantly in subjects carrying HLA-DR2, a genetic marker for susceptibility to MS. The MBP(84-102) epitope can also be presented by other major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens, including HLA-DQ1 (Ota et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1990; Pette et al., 1990; Wucherpfennig et al., 1994a) . In vivo, the T cell response to this peptide appears to be dominated by a few expanded clones. The mechanism(s) leading to clonal expansion of M BP-reactive T cells remains to be identified, but could involve recognition of viral peptides with sufficient structural similarity to the immunodominant MBP peptide. Viruses that cause latent and/or persistent infections (such as the herpes simplex and Epstein-Barr viruses) would be particularly interesting candidates, as they may permit chronic antigenic stimulation of these autoreactive T cell clones. The initiation of autoimmunity by such a mechanism could then lead to sensitization to other CNS self-antigens by determinant spreading (Lehmann et al., 1992; Kaufman et al., 1993; Tisch et al., 1993) .",

This MHC class II molecule may play a critical role in the immunopathogenesis of MS by presenting immunodominant selfpeptides to autoreactive T cells. Following injection of MBP in experimental animals, T cells specific for immunodominant peptides of MBP mediate an inflammatory response in the CNS that can be accompanied by marked demyelination (reviewed by Zamvil and Steinman, 1990) . In previous studies, two regions of human M BP were found to be immunodominant (residues 84-102 and 143-168) (Ota et al., 1990; Pette et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1990; Wucherpfennig et al., 1994a) . Reactivity to the MBP(84-102) peptide was predominantly seen in subjects carrying HLA-DR2. Using L cell transfectants as antigen-presenting cells, HLA-DR2b (DRA, DRBl*1501) was found to serve as the restriction element for these MBP(84-102)specific T cell clones. The MBP(84-102) peptide bound with high affinity to the HLA-DR2b molecule with two hydrophobic residues serving as the primary anchors (Val-89 and Phe-92 in the MBP(85-99) peptide) ( Figure 1 ) (Wucherpfennig et al., 1994a; Vogt et al., 1994) . At the first anchor position, Val-89 could be substituted by other aliphatic amino acids (leucine and isoleucine), as well as by methionine and phenylalanine; alanine was tolerated at this position but reduced the affinity of the peptide for H LA-DR2b. At the second anchor position, all aliphatic and aromatic residues were permitted; again alanine was tolerated but resulted in a loss of binding affinity.",

Based on pool sequencing of naturally processed peptides bound to HLA-DQ1, three hydrophobic positions (at position 1, 4, and 7 relative to the first anchor; Val-89, Phe-92, and lie 95 in the MBP(85-99) peptide) are thought to contribute to binding (K.

Substitution of these hydrophobic positions by aspartic acid greatly diminished the stimulatory capacity of the peptide, while substitutions by other hydrophobic amino acids were tolerated.

First, only one peptide (from human papillornavirus L2 protein) had striking sequence similarity with the MBP(85-99) peptide, in that all amino acids in the MBP(89-95) segment except position 94 (asparagine to aspartic acid) were identical (Table 2) . For all other sequences, simple alignment would not have predicted them to be efficient stimulators of MBP(85-99)specific T cell clones. Second, at positions not specified by the search criteria, the selection for particular amino acids was apparent (Table 2) . For example, for the DQ1restricted clone, aspartic acid was selected at position 94 (probably a TCR contact) in all four mimicry peptides. This position is occupied by asparagine in the MBP peptide (similar size, but no negative charge). Substitution of Asn-94 for aspartic acid in the MBP peptide markedly increased its stimulatory capacity for the DQl-restricted clone but reduced it for the DR2-restricted clone. Selection also oc- , a positive charge (lysine) was selected in two of the three mimicry peptides presented by DR2. Fourth, in the flanking segments (residues 85-87 and 97-99), no apparent selection took place as amino acids with different size and charge were allowed. The majority of the viruses are common human pathogens: influenza type A frequently causes respiratory tract infections; human papillomavirus infects epithelial tissues and has been linked to cervical carcinomas; EBV causes an acute viral syndrome (infectious mononucleosis) in young adults. Human herpesvirus I (herpes simplex), EBV, and human papillomavirus cause latent/persistent infections; the respective reservoirs are neurons (herpes simplex), B cells (EBV), and epithelial cells (papillomavirus). Virus expression can be reactivated by UV exposure and stress (herpes simplex) and by B cell activation (EBV) (Schwarz et al., 1985; Epstein and Achong, 1977; Spruance, 1985; Tovey et al., 1978) . For the induction and maintenance of an autoimmune response, these persistent viral infections are of particular interest as they could explain the chronicity of the clinical disease and the clonal expansion and persistence of MBP-specific T cells. Reactivation of viral expression may also be involved in triggering clinical relapses. By this mechanism, viral mimicry peptides could activate resting MBP-specific T cells in periphery and allow them to invade the CNS (Figure 4 ).",

To examine MHC class II-restricted presentation of the EBV DNA polymerase, an HLA-DR2 + EBV-transformed B cell line (MGAR) and an MHC-mismatched control (9001, H LA-DR1) were pretreated for 36 hr with phorbol ester, which was removed by extensive washing prior to coculture of antigen-presenting cells with T cells. T cell clones Hy.2E11 and Hy.IG11, which recognize the EBV DNA polymerase peptide presented by H LA-DR2, were activated by a H LA-DR2 \u00f7 EBV-transformed B cell line pretreated with phorbol ester. This effect was specific because MHC-mismatched B cells did not activate the clones; also, a control clone (Ob.1A12) that recognized M BP(85-99) but not the EBV peptide was not activated (Figure 3) . In a separate experiment, T cell activation was blocked by a MAb specific for HLA-DR (MAb L243) but not by a MAb specific for HLA-DQ (G2a.5). These results demonstrate that the MBP-specific T cell clones recognize not only the viral peptide but also antigen-presenting cells infected with the virus. In vivo, this recognition event could lead to chronic antigenic stimulation of MBP-specific T cells as B cell activation results in the reexpression of EBV genes, including the DNA polymerase gene. stimulatory for clone Hy.2E11. These two viral sequences were derived from the hemagglutinin subtype H13 (there are 13 serologically defined hemagglutinin subtypes of influenza type A) (Chambers et al., 1989) . These hemagglutinin peptides differed at four positions: the first substitution was at position 92 (isoleucine for valine), which anchors the peptide to DR2; the other substitutions were at positions 95-97 (Table 3) . Single amino acid substitutions demonstrated that the change at position 97 (arginine to serine) was responsible for the loss of reactivity (Table 3) . This was surprising since threonine is present in the MBP peptide (which is structurally similar to serine) and since peptide position 97 was not subject to strong selection among the mimicry peptides (the stimulatory peptides have threonine, histidine, arginine, or phenylalanine at this position). Therefore, it is likely that this substitution affects the overall peptide conformation as described for MHC class I-bound peptides (Madden et al., 1993) . These effects on the overall peptide conformation are probably responsible for the fact that the majority of viral peptides do not stimulate MBP(85-99)-specific clones. The observation that certain viral strains are capable of stimulating MBP-specific T cells while other strains are (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) (90) (91) (92) (93) (94) (95) (96) (97) (98) (99) in the context of HLA-DR2 served as a control. Clone Hy.2E11 was activated by phorbol ester-pretreated B cells that expressed HLA-DR2 but not by MHCmismatched B cells. In a separate experiment, this effect could be blocked by a MAb specific for HLA-DR (L243) but not by a MAb specific for HLA-DQ (G2a.5). T cell clone Hy.IG11 that also recognized MBP(85-99) and the EBV DNA polymerase peptide were also activated by phorbol ester-pretreated, HLA-DR2 + B cells (data not shown). T cell proliferation assays were performed as described in Table 4 . not may be important in defining the epidemiology of the disease. \"Epidemic\" outbreaks of MS have been noted (for example on the Faroe islands [Kurtzke and Hyllestad, 1979] ) that may be related to particular viral strains that possess strongly cross-reactive T cell epitopes. These results also indicate that epidemiological studies will have to take viral subtypes and viral antigenic variation into account. Influenza viruses are among the interesting candidates as presentation of the influenza hemagglutinin (from which the mimicry peptide is derived) by MHC class II molecules is well documented (Brown et al., 1991) .",

This was true for three of the seven MBP(85-99)-specific T cell clones studied. One of these clones recognized five different peptides; the other clone recognized four peptides from different antigens. This recognition did not merely represent a minor degree of cross-reactivity, since these peptides efficiently activated the MBP(85-99)specific clones. The other T cell clones were probably negative because the search criteria had focused only on the core region of the peptide (residues 88-93) that contained the most important MHC and TCR contact points common to all clones. Several clones for which no mimicry peptides were identified do, however, need a longer peptide segment than the positive clones (residues 85-97 versus residues 87-97). It is therefore likely that mimicry peptides coulcl also be identified for these clones if all positions of the peptide were subjected to a detailed mutational analysis. As only a small fraction of the peptides that matched the criteria were synthesized, it is likely that many more peptides capable of activating MBP(85-99)-specific T cells could be identified. Since only activated T cells can cross the blood-brain barrier, activation of T cells specific for CNS-specific antigens occurs in the peripheral immune system in the absence of the self-antigen. Viral peptides with sufficient structural similarity to the immunodominant MBP peptide activate these autoreactive T cells allowing them to undergo clonal expansion and CNS infiltration. Recognition of the MBP peptide in the CNS initiates the autoimmune destruction of myelin in the white matter (modified after Wucherpfennig et al., 1991) . Two influenza type A hemagglutinin peptide sequences obtained from different viral isolates matched the search criteria; one of these sequences stimulated the DRP-restricted clone, the other peptide did not. Using single amino acid substitutions of the four positions different between these two peptides, the defective stimulation of peptide 51 was mapped to position 97 (Arg to Ser). These results indicate that antigenicvariation of virusescan haveaprofound influenceon molecular T cell mimicry.

The power and the novelty of the approach chosen in the present study is, however, demonstrated by the fact that the stimulatory mimicry peptides identified only have limited primary sequence similarity and would not have been predicted (with the exception of the papilloma virus peptide) based on simple alignments between MBP(85-99) and viral antigens. A better understanding of the structural consequences of multiple simultaneous substitutions on peptide conformation will certainly enhance the predictive power of this approach.",

The molecular mimicry hypothesis postulates that there is significant cross-reactivity between viral T cell epitopes and human self-peptides. At first sight, TCR recognition appears to be exquisitely specific, since even minor substitutions in a T cell epitope can diminish or abrogate T cell activation (Reay et al., 1994) . Several lines of evidence do, however, indicate that there is a significant degree of cross-reactivity.",

            "text": "In shaping the TCR repertoire, two conflicting requirements have to be met. The first is comprehensive coverageof pathogen-derived epitopes by production of a large panel of specificities that can deal with the rapidly changing antigenic composition of pathogens. The second is elimination of TCRs that react with self-antigens that could initiate autoimmune responses. However, tolerance achieved by clonal deletion cannot be complete due to the complexity of self-antigens expressed in some organs, in particular the brain. The T cell receptor repertoire generated represents a compromise between these conflicting needs and allows a certain degree of self-reactivity in return for reasonably comprehensive coverage of foreign antigens. Cross-reactivity is part of the positive selection process in the thymus that selects T cells with low affinity for self-MHC molecules (plus peptide) and deletes T cells with higheraffinityfortheir ligand (Kappleret al., 1987; Kisielow et al., 1988; Sebzda et al., 1994) . The relatively high frequency of alloreactive T cells also indicates that T cell recognition is not absolutely specific. Cytotoxic Tcells specific for an EBV peptide bound to HLA-B8 were found to cross-react with HLA-B44 (Burrows et al., 1994) . This alloreactivity is probably the result of molecular mimicry between the HLA-B8-bound EBV peptide and a HLA-B44bound self-peptide that remains to be identified. Molecular mimicry may also be an important mechanism in experimental autoimmune diseases. Immunization of Lewis rats with complete Freund's adjuvant induces a strong T cell response to a mycobacterial heat shock protein 65 (hsp65) peptide. HspGBreactive T cell clones mediate arthritis by cross-reacting with ajoint proteoglycan (van Eden et al., 1985 (van Eden et al., , 1988 . While the cross-reacting joint peptide remains to be biochemically defined, molecular mimicry between hsp65 and a joint proteoglycan appears to be the underlying pathogenetic mechanism. Significant sequence similarity had also been noted between a T cell epitope of rabbit MBP and hepatitis B virus. Administration of this hepatitis B virus peptide was found to induce histological signs of CNS inflammation and T cell reactivity to MBP in a polyclonal population (Fujinami and Oldstone, 1985) .",

In addition, the temporal relationship between a viral infection and the initiation of MS is not clear in most cases, as the clinical diagnosis is frequently made at a time when magnetic resonance scans demonstrate a relatively large number of old lesions (Stadt et al., 1990) . It may, however, be possible to directly demonstrate the causal relationship in patients with postinfectious encephalomyelitis by establishing both virus-specific and MBP-specific T cell clones. The importance of molecular mimicry could also be demonstrated in MS patients with a recent viral infection (high IgM antibody titers to a particular virus) and magnetic resonance scans indicative of a recent onset of disease.",

The observation that several pathogens carry mimicry epitopes of MBP(85-99) could explain why it has been so difficult to link the immunopathogenesis of MS to a single viral agent. Rather, it appears that a group of common viral pathogens, in particular the herpes virus family (EBV, herpes simplex, and cytomegalovirus), influenza viruses, and papillomaviruses could be involved in initiating the autoimmune process. This notion is supported by clinical and epidemiological data that suggest the involvement of several pathogens; the observation that oligoclonal immunoglobulins in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients are specific for several different viruses also points in this direction (Kurtzke, 1985; Baig et al., 1989) . Childhood immunization against viral pathogens that carry mimicry T cell epitopes may reduce the risk of developing MS later in life. Genetic modifications of viral vaccines that eliminate proven mimicry epitopes could make viral vaccines safer and reduce the frequency of postvaccinal encephalomyelitis.",
