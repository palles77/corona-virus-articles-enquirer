In autologous transplants, the stem cells serving as a marrow graft are derived from the patient themselves; in syngeneic transplants, the stem cells are derived from a genetically identical twin; and in allogeneic transplants, the stem cells are taken from a nonidentical sibling or unrelated donor. Because autologous and syngeneic transplants involve stem cells that are immunologically identical to the recipient, reactions between graft and host are avoided. In allogeneic transplants, mismatch between donor and recipient human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) mediate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft rejection. The decision about which type of transplant to perform is based on the nature and stage of the underlying disease, on whether a suitable donor is available, and the medical condition of the recipient. The advantages to allogeneic transplantation over autologous transplantation include a higher likelihood that the stem cell product is free of tumor contamination and the presence of graft-versus-tumor activity.",

Irradiation is generally omitted from autologous conditioning regimens because of concerns for late toxicity and secondary malignancies. Most myeloablative regimens used before allogeneic transplantation consist of cyclophosphamide administered either with busulfan or TBI.

Published series report an incidence ranging from 2% to 35%, reflecting the relative difficulty in making the diagnosis, because patients with \"idiopathic\" pneumonia may actually have occult infection (particularly CMV pneumonia) or pulmonary toxicity because of conditioning regimens. Some have reported a trend toward a higher IPS occurrence after allogeneic transplantation, whereas others have shown a relatively equivalent incidence in recipients of allogeneic and autologous HSCT at 7.6% and 5.7%, respectively. Among allogeneic recipients, the incidence of IPS is significantly lower after nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens than traditional high-dose regimens, consistent with the idea that IPS is the result of chemoradiotherapy. Other risk factors include older age, transplantation for malignancy other than leukemia, high-dose conditioning regimens, total body irradiation, and high-grade acute GVHD. Studies in murine models suggest that the etiology involves an alloimmune cytokine storm from myeloablative conditioning, recruitment of inflammatory and immune-effector cells to the lung, release of oxidants and proinflammatory cytokines, and resultant inflammatory lung injury. The median time to onset of IPS ranges from 21 to 50 days after transplantation. Patients are seen with fever, dyspnea, nonproductive cough, hypoxia, and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. Patients may progress to respiratory failure within a few days. Mortality approaches 75%. Treatment is primarily supportive care.

Other risk factors include older age, lower pretransplant FEV 1 /FVC ratio, low serum immunoglobulin levels, methotrexate use, and early posttransplant respiratory viral infections. The etiology is unclear, but its strong association with GVHD suggests an immune-mediated injury induced by donor cytotoxic T cells against host bronchial epithelium.

Patients with bronchiolitis obliterans are seen with insidious onset of nonproductive cough, dyspnea, and wheezing. Chest radiographs are often normal, but high-resolution CT shows air trapping, hypoattenuation, and bronchial dilatation. PFTs show airflow limitation that progresses with time; also, the rate of progression is variable, with some having rapid progression to hypercapnic respiratory failure and death and others having a protracted course.

            "text": "If no diagnosis is made with either bronchoscopy or TTNA, surgical lung biopsy by either open thoracotomy or videoassisted thorascopic approach is considered next and is the diagnostic \"gold standard\" (60-83% sensitivity) in evaluating pulmonary infiltrates after HSCT. The effect of surgical lung biopsy on patient outcome and survival is still controversial, however. Some studies have shown that patients with surgical lung biopsy had poorer outcomes, that the results rarely led to a change in therapy, and that the patients frequently had complications such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, prolonged mechanical ventilation, wound hematoma and dehiscence, incisional neuritis, and tumor recurrence at chest tube site. The procedure is associated with a postoperative mortality up to 8%. Survival at 30 and 90 days may be increased in patients who have a specific diagnosis. We recommend reserving open biopsy for patients whose underlying condition has a reasonable prognosis and those in whom the results might have a good chance of changing management. ",
