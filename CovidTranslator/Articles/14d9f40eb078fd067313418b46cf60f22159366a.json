            "text": "Health in the 21st century is being shaped by rapid globalisation. The unprecedented movement of people, money, technology, and ideas around the world is changing the profile of health and disease. Although previous decades have seen substantial reductions in major global risk factors such as unsafe sanitation, and malnutrition, new threats have emerged. 1 Global health hazards nowadays share four important features: (i) health hazards are not bound by borders, ranging from infectious diseases, to non-communicable diseases, and injuries; (ii) they have common underlying causes, such as dangerous pathogens, unhealthy behaviours, or unsafe environments; (iii) they are exacerbated by inequities linked to the socio-economic determinants of health; and (iv) they require a coordinated, multi-sectoral global response. [2] [3] [4] A crucial element of that response will be the strategic use of law at all levels-local, national, and international-resting on stronger cooperation between the legal and health professions. Just as the interdependence of states and people heightens health risks, it also presents unprecedented opportunities to confront global health threats collaboratively, drawing on expertise and lessons learned within and among nation states.",

Although many global health professionals will be familiar with legal measures as an emergency response to health crises, this is only one facet of law. 5 Less well understood is the role of law in governing global health institutions, in resolving disputes, and in health promotion and protection. Even less visible are those uses of law that, while not necessarily designed to affect health, have a profound impact upon it.

By law, we mean the statutes, regulations, and rules that express public policy. We also include the public institutions such as legislatures, agencies, and courts in our definition, which are responsible for creating, implementing, and interpreting the law. 9 Law exerts a powerful influence on health by structuring, perpetuating, and mediating the risk factors and underlying conditions known as the social determinants of health: 10 education, food, housing, income, employment, sanitation, and health care. The impact of law is felt not only in individual decisions (eg, of courts and tribunals) but also in statutes and regulations that operate at the population level (eg, agricultural subsidies, Universal Health Coverage [UHC] , or mandatory seat belt usage). As such, law can be a powerful tool for securing and advancing health and equity. It can be used to set and defend the norms and standards of good health, to establish and strengthen resilient health systems, and to hold actors and institutions accountable.",

Throughout history, misguided, out-dated, arbitrary, or discriminatory laws have caused great harm. Punitive laws, for example, can discourage marginalised individuals from accessing care, restrict reproductive rights, and enable discrimination in employment or insurance. Whether driven by animus or unsupported by scientific evidence, bad laws can undermine individual and population health, while entrenching inequalities. They can exclude, stigmatise, and inappropriately punish individuals. Furthermore, they can constrict the space for dissent and debate, for an independent press, and for social action. In such cases, law reform is crucial-but often difficult. The process of overturning old national legislation or adopting revised or new treaties often involves bitter and drawn-out struggles. New or better health laws can threaten the interests of powerful actors, including states, businesses, and lobbyists, who will vigorously oppose reform. Even if law reform is possible, once in force, new laws face challenges of moni toring and enforcement, in arenas often characterised by fragmentation and contestation.",

The SDGs envision \"justice for all\", resting on \"transparent, effective, and accountable institutions\". 14 The multiple actors, institutions, and sectors in global health offer great promise to achieve health with justice, but also face steep challenges. Governments and international institutions do not harness the full power of law to improve health and save lives-whether by dismantling barriers or by enacting affirmative reforms to safeguard population health. Therefore, ensuring that the global health community clearly understands the role of the law, and how best to use it, is imperative. This report makes the case for the power of law to improve health, by informing the global health community about the effects of law on health (through what we describe as the legal determinants of health); exploring real-world case studies, opportunities and challenges; linking the health and legal communities, while building shared capacity (ie, infrastructure and resources); and empowering com munities, countries, and global health institutions to use law to advance global health with justice. 9 The Commission assembled a multidisciplinary team of experts from diverse backgrounds, including law, health, policy, economics, and governance. While reflecting this richness of expertise, our Report sits within the disciplinary tradition of public health law scholarship, 15 and the emerging field of global health law scholarship. 7 Public health law is \"the study of the legal powers and duties of the state to ensure the conditions for people to be healthy \u2026 and the limitations on the power of the state to constrain the\u2026legally protected interests of individuals for the common good.\" 15 Global health law, as a related field of study, uses a similar analytical orientation, but focuses on the relationship between international law and health.",

Therefore, the Commission has had to be selective, and, for this reason, is necessarily limited in scope. Our concept of legal determinants is not the only way to frame the topic. Rather, it reflects the Commission's views of what constitute the major dimensions of law in global health, in the present era.

The field of global health is complex, comprising a web of instit utions, norms, and processes at the global, national, and subnational levels. Weak gover nance undermines leadership and coordinated action for health. Law can strengthen health governance, including transparency, benchmarks, and monitoring, with ongoing evaluation, civil society engagement, and accountability. The third legal determinant is that law can implement fair, evidencebased health interventions. Evidence-based public health laws-effectively imple mented and enforced-can create the conditions for healthy populations. We offer key examples of effective laws across three health domains: infectious diseases, non-communicable dis eases, and injuries. We also show how law can undermine health and justice. The final legal determinant is that law can be used to build legal capacities and reinforce all the legal determinants of health. All the aforementioned determinants require stronger, mutually reinforcing link ages between law and health. Effective health laws are guided by science and translate the best available evidence on health improve ment. Legal capacity building includes stronger legal institutions (legislatures, agencies, and courts), expanding the evidence-base with research evaluating the effectiveness of laws, and training key actors in law-making and law-implementing skills.",

Once implemented, people experience the effects of law every day, as it shapes their lives through the enforcement of legal standards and accompanying policies. This understanding of law is best illustrated at the domestic level, where the recognised authority is the sovereign state-the supreme authority within that territory. Because nation states have sovereign authority, they can enact and enforce laws. However, no sovereign authority exists at the international level, and the law requires states to agree to the terms of the legal instrument.

Soft rules can form a basis for the development of formal international law, or international governments could adopt non-binding standards into their legal instruments. For example, WTO's Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures incorporates the non-binding guidelines of the Codex Alimentarius Commission-a collection of internationally recognised standards, codes of practice, and guidelines that apply throughout the food supply chain. 23 The United Nations Political Declaration on the Prevention and Control of Noncommunicable Diseases (September 2011) offers another example of soft rules.

In countries where patents are not filed or granted, local production or importation of generics is possible, and the competition from these generics, in turn, drops the price and increases access to the drug. An example of this was observed in Georgia and Morocco; 49 in both countries, primary patents for the directacting antiviral sofosbuvir were not filed. As a result, generic companies could produce that drug, enter the market, and decrease the price of the drug.",

            "text": "In countries where patents are issued, another set of options have been utilised by groups and countries to mitigate patent-related barriers. For example, some non-governmental organisations have been attempting to systematically test or undermine patents issued in certain countries to facilitate competition and access. 46 Many national patent regimes provide the opportunity for third party filings, which serve as a way to register concerns about whether the compound has sufficiently met the requirements of patentability. Non-governmental organisation attempts to undermine patents have led to the rejection of key patent applications for direct-acting antivirals in Brazil, China, Egypt, and Ukraine. 46, [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] Where patents exist and have been unsuccessfully challenged, another option available to groups and countries is voluntary licence agreements. These agreements formalise originator companies' permission to manufacture and sell generic versions of their drug regimens in specific countries or regions. As a result, countries included in originator companies' voluntary licensing agreements are able to access generic direct-acting antivirals from licencees at lower prices. 53 For example, one manufacturer licenced its products to eleven generic manufacturers in India, facilitating the sale of generics in more than 100 countries. 53 Countries not included in voluntary licence agreements can still increase competition and access by way of other strategies. The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), 54 an international legal agreement between all the member nations of the World Trade Organization, acts to constrain actions for countries with respect to patents. However, countries do have the right under TRIPS to grant government use or compulsory licences in certain circumstances. 54, 55 In September, 2017, Malaysia became the first country to issue a compulsory licence for a direct-acting antiviral. 46, 52 After issuing the licence, Malaysia was then included in the voluntary licence agreement of some manufacturers. 56 The net effect of this global patchwork of patent laws and policies is, on the one hand, a steep price cut in low-income and middle-income countries, and, on the other hand, a slowly declining price trend in upper middle-income and high-income countries. 46 The former is promising because more than 60% of people with hepatitis C nowadays live in a country that could access generic direct-acting antivirals. 46 However, not all countries that can access more affordable generic treatments do, and, still more troubling, although some competition has altered prices in upper middle-income and high-income countries, high prices of direct-acting antivirals continues to impede access to an effective cure. 46 adjudicate according to the parties and evidence in front of them, rather than considering issues at the population level. Are judges better placed to decide on the allocation of scarce health resources than elected officials? When is it appropriate for a court to decide that an individual litigant is entitled to access pharmaceuticals not listed on the government's or WHO's essential medicines registries?",

Tobacco control litigation, still in process, has produced two well known outcomes. The first was the 1998 Master Settlement Agreement, which forced tobacco companies to curtail marketing and to make annual payments, in perpetuity, to US states, and the second was the \"Tobacco Papers\", a vast cache of internal industry documents uncovered in 1994 that revealed duplicitous industry actions such as concealing the harms of tobacco use and the addictiveness of nicotine, and marketing directed toward children and adolescents. 58 Tobacco litigation has had enduring effects on public health. The litigation exposed the unethical behaviour of industry executives, informed the public of the devastating dangers of tobacco smoke, and secured industry funds for health promotion. The Tobacco Papers are housed in a public repository, informing subsequent tobacco control measures throughout the world. 59 The FCTC emphasises the value of domestic litigation, asking parties of states to share information and strategies.",

            "text": "Strategic litigation can also precisely interpret broad or abstract principles, such as the right to health, leading to improved health care. Litigation on access to anti-retroviral drugs is one area in which notable success has been achieved. In Minister of Health versus Treatment Action Campaign (2002), the Constitutional Court of South Africa held that government limits on the public sector provision of nevirapine were unreasonable and unconstitutional. Nevirapine halves perinatal HIV trans mission rates. The Court found that limiting access was a breach of the right to health care, which was not consistent with a positive state obligation to progressively realise the rights of mothers and infants to essential health services. 60 Similarly, the Venezuelan Supreme Court (1999) required the State to provide HIV treatment and to develop social awareness campaigns. 61 In 2000, the Argentine Supreme Court found that the \"right to health falls within the right to life\u2026the first natural right of the individual\", and directed the government to provide HIV treatment. 62 These cases, along with other right to health litigation, have contributed greatly to social movements. 63 Controversies in public health litigation have also been reported. Modelled on the cases described above, individuals have increasingly launched health rights litigation around the world on issues including reproductive rights, mental health, and smoking in public places. 64 Notably, this litigation often occurs in the context of democratic failure: litigants turn to the courts because corruption, autocratic practices, and the dominance of powerful interests provide little opportunity for changing policies through the political system. 65 Although gaining traction, 66 the justiciability of the right to health (ie, the question whether or not a court can adjudicate a claim brought on the basis of the right to health) remains a contested issue in many jurisdictions. 64 The long-term effects of litigation on equity and justice are not yet clear, 64 and are dependent on context. For example, one study of litigation in a southern Brazilian state concluded that \"judicialization largely serves the disadvantaged who turn to the courts to secure a wide range of medicines.\" 67 However, in other cases, courts have granted individuals access to expensive medications, some of which have little demonstrated value. When courts override careful policy assessments by the legislature, they might divert resources for health that could otherwise have been used for more cost-effective interventions. Consequently, scholars have noted: \"Courts in adjudicating health human rights need to frame the right in the context of In 1991, Colombia enacted a new Constitution followed by a series of reforms intended to extend health insurance to all citizens. The 1991 Constitution enshrined economic and social rights, establishing a Constitutional Court as a specialised tribunal to oversee the new constitutional jurisdiction. This gave individuals the right, when economic and civil rights were not being met, to take the government to court through a writ called a tutela. 69 Tutelas give citizens an avenue to ensure that the government actively provides for their constitutional rights, including rights to health care.",

Moreover, the Colombian Court had to carefully assess the practical and financial burden its decision would have on the government. As scholars have noted, \"if health-related rights are treated as unconditional and not limited by resource capacity, this can put an unsustainable burden on public insurers and undermine the ability to [act] as wise stewards of public resources through negotiating prices or resisting patent extensions and so forth\". 68 the larger equity and solidarity goals of a public health care system\u2026one danger with a rights-based approach is that it can reinforce the individual demands for highpriced treatments, thus exacerbating the difficulties governments have in running fair and efficient health care systems.\" 68 This danger was realised in Colombia, where individuals bringing legal actions known as tutelas overwhelmed the public health system in the 1990s and 2000s, requiring a judicial ruling on the limits and definition of the right to health (panel 4).",

In the US tobacco litigation, industry defendants imposed enormous delays and high costs over the course of decades and multiple waves of litigation before health advocates eventually gained traction in the courts. 76 Many industries, including the food, beverage, alcohol, and tobacco industries often use litigation to diminish innovative public health laws. In 2012, tobacco companies successfully halted US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations to mandate graphic warnings. The US Supreme Court found that the FDA rule violated the companies' constitutional commercial speech rights.

In 2011, CEDAW heard the matter of Alyne da Silva Pimental Teixeira versus Brazil, which concerned human rights violations in the context of maternal mortality. CEDAW recommended reparations for the individual harmed, also recommending that Brazil reduce maternal mortality risks and discrimination against pregnant women.

A mandate refers to the explicit, implied, and customary powers and responsibilities of an organisation. 82 A state's constitution defines the government's obligations to safeguard the public's health and to protect personal freedoms and rights. Constitutions often establish branches of government, allocating power among them (and setting limits on those powers), and delineating responsibilities. Statutes establish a country's key agencies, such as the Ministry of Health, defining its mandate and powers, while allocating funds for its operations. Treaties establish and govern inter national institutions, such as WHO. The WHO constitution is a legally binding treaty that defines the organisation's mission, scope of its organisational activities, and the responsibilities of its organs (assembly, executive board, regional and country offices, and secretariat). A corporation's mandate-that is, the purpose for which the corporation has been established-is set out in its charter or founding documents, such as a Memorandum of Association. Corporations are formed under provincial or federal laws that specify their fiduciary duties, duties to report and pay tax, and other responsibilities. Statutes and regulations can define the activities, structure, and limitations of a not-for-profit organisation with a global health mission. Non-governmental organisations must abide by the legal parameters set for their operation. The proliferation of institutions working in global health has added a new level of complexity, which includes the overlapping mandates of public, private, and nongovernmental organisations, and public-private partnerships. We elaborate on these issues in section 3.",

WTO members are required to implement the 1995 Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) through national legislation recognising and enforcing pharmaceutical patents. 54 However, in many jurisdictions, these intellectual property protections have limited individuals' access to medicines. In response, governments have devised mechanisms to balance intellectual property protection with greater access to medicines. 85 Therefore, national legislation on medicines procurement or patentability criteria, as well as TRIPS flexibilities, have sought to expand social goals, while recognising private rights. 86 Yet further scope remains for countries to use the flexibilities that TRIPS provides to enable greater access to medicines. 87 Non-state actors can also provide a check on unreasonable exercise of government power. Civil society organisations are instrumental in demanding transparency and account ability from governing institutions. Non-state actors have a powerful voice in pushing governments and international institutions to use their legal tools in a manner that promotes justice and human rights, such as by protecting marginalised or disadvantaged populations. For example, advocacy on HIV has spurred government action around the world, ranging from research funding through to expanded treatment access. 88 Whether at the grassroots level or internationally, participation by non-state actors and civil society organisations in governing processes increases the legitimacy, transparency, justice, and democracy of such processes.",

Institutions established as PPPs often have a specific mandate, with control and influence shared by the public and private partners. They exist on a continuum, in which some are more public in nature (eg, largely financed funding agencies that include private actors on their boards), whereas others are closer to private institutionseg, entities working closely with the private sector to accelerate research and development (figure 2). 105 The largest PPPs operating in global health include the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. Unitaid is a PPP that invests in innovations to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is among the newer PPPs, working to galvanise the development of new vaccines against diseases with pandemic potential. In 2016, the US National Academy of Sciences found that PPPs could deliver \"improved responsiveness and accountability to society and\u2026better outcomes in shorter timeframes.\" 105 Civil society organisations-primarily non-governmental organisations-have long been influential in global health as advocates for research and treatment, and for human rights.

Although these rights groups are often left out of formal global diplomacy, civil society organisations can be an influential voice for human rights and the right to health, especially domestically, as well as in multi-partner alliances such as the Framework Convention Alliance on Tobacco Control. 106 Section 1 provided an introduction to the legal system for global health, including explanations of three key functions of law and the key players. We now turn to the substantive ways in which law can affect health and justice, which we characterise as the legal determinants of health.",

A world with equitable and universal access to quality education at all levels, to Organisation with primarily public sector characteristics Public health care and social protection, where physical, mental and social well-being are assured. A world where we reaffirm our commitments regarding the human right to safe drinking water and sanitation and where there is improved hygiene; and where food is sufficient, safe, affordable and nutritious.'' 14 Member states promised to rigorously implement this agenda, which comprises 17 goals (the SDGs) and 169 targets, by 2030. They replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while building on their success, expanding their scope, and highlighting unfinished business. Committing to \"leave no one behind\", the SDGs articulate an equity agenda, developed through a crosscutting multisectoral strategy involving a consultative, grass-roots process. 107 ",

The WHO and the World Bank both estimate that at least half of the world's population cannot obtain essential health services. 117 The most glaring inequities in health outcomes often correlate directly with unequal access to health services: service coverage is often poorest where needs are greatest. 118 These inequities occur both between countries (healthy life expectancy is 44\u00b74 years in Sierra Leone, compared with 74\u00b79 in Japan) 119 and within countries (ethnicity, geography, and socioeconomic status can greatly reduce the accessibility and quality of health care). 120 For example, in Australia, life expectancy for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men born from 2010 to 2012, was 10\u00b76 years lower than that of non-Indigenous men. The discrepancy for women was nearly as wide at 9\u00b75 years. 121 The WHO views UHC as among its highest priorities. 8, 117, [122] [123] [124] [125] In 2005, the 58th World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted a resolution for sustainable health financing, universal coverage, and social health insurance, calling on countries to plan for the transition to UHC. 126 Since then, UHC has become a global priority and a central element of WHO's efforts to strengthen health systems and improve the quality and distribution of health and health services. [127] [128] [129] With the UN General Assembly adopting the SDGs in September, 2015, UHC became a global target, which will be reinforced by the UN high-level meeting on UHC in 2019. 130 SDG 3.8 views UHC as \"financial risk protection, access to quality essential health care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all\". 113 SDG 3.8, if fully implemented, would help realise the universal right to health.",

Since 2010, over 100 countries have sought technical guidance from WHO and the World Bank to move towards UHC. 135 Countries representing half of the world's population (Brazil, China, India, Russian Federation, and South Africa) are engaged in health system reforms to extend service coverage and increase financial protection. 135 Although UHC often faces political resistance because of cost, the World Bank regards it as high value for money. 134 UHC brings direct benefits such as improved population health and more productive societies. 136 Health coverage also contributes indirectly to development, as healthy children learn better, 137, 138 and healthy populations facilitate economic growth. 139, 140 Furthermore, studies show that for every dollar spent on key health services, the direct and indirect benefits would exceed costs by a factor of between 9 and 20, further showing the benefits that arise from investing in health. 3 ",

Yet, governments are also obligated to provide international assistance to protect and promote the right to health, for example under article 2(1) of the ICESCR. The concept of shared responsibilities for health has a \"solid textual foundation\". 42 The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) guidelines on maternal morbidity and mortality and human rights, the UNAIDS and OHCHR guidelines on HIV and AIDS and human rights, and the Maastricht Principles on Extraterritorial Obligations of States in the Area of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights all confirm the international obligation to provide assistance on UHC. Furthermore, the UN Special Rapporteurs on the Right to Health have been clear on the obligations of states in so-called hard law and soft rules. 145 Because states hold the primary responsibility to create and maintain UHC, many argue that gaping inequalities between countries are beyond legal remedy. We reject this proposition. The international community holds a responsibility to reduce health disparities, and international health assistance will remain an important funding source. Low-income and middle-income countries do need to devote a higher percentage of their gross domestic product (GDP) into health systems, but still might be unable to afford the estimated US$86 per capita (2012) required for UHC, and $112 per capita (2014) to achieve the health SDG. 146, 147 The first Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, Paul Hunt, observed that ''if there is no legal obligation underpinning the human rights responsibility of international assistance and cooperation, inescapably all international assistance and cooperation is based fundamentally upon charity. While such a position might have been tenable 100 years ago, it is unacceptable in the twenty-first century.'' 148 Although there is a strong ethos of charitable discretion in international health assistance, sustainable funding requires a mutual sense of responsibility between those providing and those receiving assistance. 149 Otherwise, the international system creates a situation in which governments can blame each other for not doing enough. 150 Moreover, in low-income countries, or those with unstable governments, weak health systems can exacerbate vulnerabilities leading to extremism and violence.",

Moving closer to universal coverage means expanding the cube: extending coverage to more people, including the marginalised and vulnerable; offering more services to meet essential health needs; and paying a greater part of the cost, thereby protecting citizens from impoverishment. 152 Increasing coverage also requires good governance, and an understanding of both the documented and practical gaps in UHC: the possible \"bottlenecks and weaknesses that prevent health systems from serving the entire population and from providing the full suite of priority services at a cost that is affordable and sustainable.\" 86 Crucially, UHC must be understood as effective, affordable access to quality health services (UHC in practice)-and not merely covering everyone with some form of insurance, regardless of whether they can in fact access quality health services (UHC on paper). Effective access, particularly for those with the least means, will not only depend on how health systems are designed (eg, strengthening primary health services), but also on how health insurance systems are designed.

The term \"universal\" in UHC relates to a state's duty to provide health services to all people under its jurisdiction. Without adequate legal frameworks to support it, so-called universality might be no more than an aspiration, doing little to change \"policies under which many governments either deliberately or passively refuse to grant access to health services to some people living within their national borders\". 153 Governments often exclude a wide swath of vulnerable people from high quality services, including asylum seekers, refugees, undocumented immigrants, expatriate workers, indigenous peoples, nomadic people, or groups that are historically marginalised because of sexual orientation, gender identity, sex characteristics, disability, political beliefs, or religious affiliation. 153, 154 These populations are often already vulnerable, and least able to afford out-of-pocket health care expenditures; they are precisely the groups a UHC system should aim to cover. For example, in Rwanda, households are means-tested on their assets and revenue and stratified accordingly. The government then pays premiums for the 25% of the population who have been classified as the most vulnerable. 155 The law should inclusively define the meaning of the term universal in a country's UHC scheme, as well as providing redress in cases of discrimination or service denial. This can be achieved by enshrining the right to health in a country's constitution or legislation; 152 establishing a patient charter of rights that defines the right of access to the scheme, along with a dispute resolution system to deal with complaints by those who are denied health services to which they are entitled; 86 empowering a health-care ombudsman or health-care commission with powers to investigate breaches of the State's duty to provide health services; decentralising or devolving health systems management, so that people can access services (including dispute resolution) at the local level, without having to travel; regulating the way in which health insurance schemes (public and private) deal with membership and coverage, such as banning insurers from discriminating against individuals with pre-existing conditions and requiring coverage of essential services such as vaccines, primary care, nutrition services, and child and maternal health; and ensuring statutory protection for the security, privacy, and confidentiality of health information. 86 The Y-axis, or, the cost axis, describes financing in UHC. Governments express genuine concerns about financing UHC. 152 Full funding entails developing health systems that can deliver all required health services that are of good quality and readily accessible to the whole population. Sustainable financing can involve one of two strategies. Governments can allocate more of their overall budget to health-for example, at least 5% of GDP. 156, 157 Alternatively or in addition, they can find new ways to raise revenue, whether by improving general tax administration and collection, increasing existing taxes, or introducing new taxes. 152 States can raise revenue for UHC in a variety of ways. In countries with a longer history of UHC, funds are Extend coverage for health services to more people Reduce out-of-pocket fees and cost sharing Funding mechanism created from pooled funds traditionally raised through compulsory pre-payment schemes, such as taxation, compulsory insurance contributions, or a combination of both. 86 Conversely, low-income and lower-middle-income countries that have moved towards UHC are using novel mixes of funding mechanisms for their national health insurance models. 158 These include general taxes, earmarked taxes (eg, raised from taxing unhealthy products such as tobacco, alcohol, sugary beverages, or from airline taxes-a key source of financing for Unitaid), payroll deductions, household premium contributions, and in some cases, foreign assistance (eg, about half of the financing for South Africa's UHC programme comes from the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief). 134, 158, 159 However, countries, should not overly rely on international health assistance because it can be inconsistent and unreliable, impeding the government's ability to plan for and finance its health system over the long term. Additionally, donors often give preference to their own special areas of health need, which might not match what the host population needs.",

A country's essential medicines list, for example, ought to be based on population needs, evidence of effectiveness, and cost. Law and regulation are integral to making difficult choices, because they establish processes and institutions to guide transparent decision making. States use legal processes to express national health priorities, and legal frameworks define and delineate that which is possible for a state to achieve. In determining what is and is not covered, states use a variety of legal mechanisms and institutions, including the following four examples. First, independent statutory authorities are tasked with reviewing clinical and epidemiological evidence and providing advice to governments about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treatments and technologiesfor example, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. Second, administrative agencies are tasked with determining which medications are placed on formularies, and the amount or extent of any government subsidy. Third, legislation can specify which services, or categories of services should be provided under a UHC scheme. Finally, courts and tribunals can make de-facto decisions on service prioritisation. In South Africa, the Constitutional Court required access to antiretroviral medication for pregnant women, 60 while in Brazil the judiciary has ruled on numerous claims of denial of access to medicines. Conversely, Colombia's Constitution Court required priorities to be decided through a participatory, evidence-based process (panel 4). Litigation can raise its own problems, including the concern that it could favour wealthy litigants and thus entrench health inequalities. 163 Finally, good governance is an important role of the law in achieving UHC. An effective UHC programme requires a process of monitoring, evaluation, and accountability, including independent review, dispute resolution, and a compensatory process in the event of adverse outcomes, as well as other administrative, political, legal, and social remedies. 164 Again, law plays a vital role. Because health sector corruption drains scarce resources, eliminating corruption is an essential component of good governance.",

Robust public accountability and participation are more likely to result in reasonable and legitimate decisions, and fair, effective implementation. Such mechanisms are essential when deciding on the overall strategy, the specific pathways, and the appropriateness of central trade-offs, for UHC. 118 Finally, a functional UHC programme requires a framework for dispute resolution, with explicit rules to guide those seeking relief. Different mechanisms for review and dispute resolution exist, including litigation and alternative dispute resolution. Considering the many public and private claims that arise under UHC, a country could establish a separate adjudication process for individual claims, similar to the Colombian tutela example (panel 5).

Before 2016, countries were required to self-assess their IHR compliance and competencies. In 2016, WHO worked with the GHSA to introduce a new process and tool, the Joint External Evaluation (JEE). 184, 185 Under the JEE, independent experts work alongside national officials to ensure transparent reporting. However, JEE is voluntary and some countries remain reluctant to adopt it, in some cases because of concerns about national sovereignty. Furthermore, regarding the points at which JEE does identify gaps in IHR competencies, no comprehensive global mechanism exists to assist low-income countries to finance required reforms. As observed during the Ebola crisis, this absence of a global mechanism presents a potential threat to global security. 39, 99 Additionally, states could withhold cooperation for political or economic reasons. For example, the IHR require rapid state identification and reporting of novel infections to WHO. However, if states parties do report novel infections they could face travel and trade restrictions or loss of tourism and prestige. Consequently, states might be reluctant to comply in a timely manner with the IHR's reporting obligations. States parties in west Africa were late in reporting Ebola in 2014. When an epidemic did engulf these countries, governments widely ignored WHO recommendations not to impose travel and trade restrictions. Airlines also unilaterally suspended flights to the region. 186 Addressing the challenge of weak treaty compliance There are creative ways to foster state compliance, even if it is extraordinarily difficult to assure that compliance. Treaty oversight bodies need to work with states and other stakeholders to find innovative ways to promote treaty implementation. This is also true for soft rules, which are often amenable to similar complianceenhancing incentives and methods. The following are examples of tools that could facilitate compliance, and many already exist in most compliance-enhancing international instruments.",

Both hard law and soft rules could require or encourage states to self-report their progress. Fully transparent reporting is vital, and the oversight authority (such as WHO's Director-General) publicly holds states accountable for abiding, or failing to abide by the relevant norms. For example, the public should know if states fail to rapidly report novel infections as required under the IHR. Greater transparency encourages states to abide by global norms.",

Similarly, evidence of effectiveness for portion controls on sugary beverages might come from studies showing increased portion size, and its relationship to overweight or obesity. In such cases, policy makers need to make informed choices for law reform, in the absence of complete evidence. While using the best available (albeit incomplete) evidence at the time, evaluating the law's effect to ensure continuous quality improvement in health legislation is imperative. Even then, though, law makers might need to accept some uncertainty, such as where there is clear evidence that a suite of legal measures is effective at addressing a complex health threat (eg, obesity, or gun violence), but it is difficult to determine the specific contribution of any single intervention.

At a national level, law makers should pay particular attention to the needs of the poorest, the most vulnerable, and those who are marginalised.

In 2015, 16\u00b79 million deaths were estimated to occur before age 70 years and 9\u00b72 million before age 60 years. Moreover, the huge toll of death and disability from non-communicable diseases does not affect all populations equally; 31 million (or three quarters of the total) of global non-communicable disease deaths occur in low-income and middle-income countries. The main noncommunicable diseases-cardiovascular diseases, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes mellitus-share four main behavioural risk factors: tobacco use, physical inactivity, the harmful use of alcohol, and unhealthy diets. 160 Evidence shows that social and economic circumstances can significantly increase the risk of noncommunicable diseases. 219 An increasingly strong evidence base exists regarding how population-level interventions can be used to prevent and control non-communicable diseases. WHO's Global Action Plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases 2013-20, including the updated appendix 3, represents the most important normative instrument on non-communicable diseases at the global level. 160 Many of its policy recommendations, some of which are so-called best buys for public health (highly cost-effective, evidence-based interventions), include the use of law and regulation (panel 6). Building on the strong evidence of success in Denmark, New York City and other settings, WHO now recommends that countries use legislation to eliminate industrial trans fats in the food supply.",

WHO's non-communicable diseases Global Action Plan incorporates the FCTC's provisions in its recommended actions. Updated appendix 3 calls on states parties to \"strengthen the effective implementation of the WHO FCTC and its protocols\", including by establishing \"national mechanisms for coordination of the WHO FCTC implementation as part of national strategy with specific mandate, responsibilities and resources\". 160 The action plan also invites member states that are not parties to the FCTC to \"consider implementing the measures set out in the WHO FCTC and its protocols, as the foundational instrument in global tobacco control\". 160 The FCTC provides a prime example of the interrelationship between international and domestic law, providing a precedent for future global health governance. The WHA in 1995 urged member states that had already successfully implemented all or most of a comprehensive strategy for tobacco control to provide assistance to WHO. 220 This aid would allow WHO to provide advice and support to other member states seeking to improve their tobacco control strategies. The following year, the WHA voted to begin work on developing a framework convention. A decade later, the FCTC entered into force. 221 The FCTC has had a substantial effect on global tobacco control, with its norms widely implemented at national and local levels. Particularly in high-income countries, a so-called suite of national and local laws and regulations has resulted in large declines in tobacco use. A combination of legal interventions all operate to reduce smoking in youth and adults, including lowering the legal age for buying tobacco products, marketing bans or restrictions, bans on smoking in public places, high taxation, and graphic packet warnings. For example, 111 of 181 FCTC states parties require pictorial warnings on cigarette packages, as recommended under Article 11. 222 Governments are now implementing major so-called endgame strategies, such as gradually increasing the legal smoking age, and vast reductions in the nicotine levels in cigarettes, which addict virtually all smokers. 223 However, the FCTC faces substantial compliance challenges, particularly in low-income and middleincome countries. For instance, Article 14 encourages countries to put in place tobacco cessation infrastructure but does not provide the resources to allow low-income and middle-income countries to do so. As of 2013, only a minority of countries had in place the infrastructure necessary to offer cessation support to tobacco users. 224 Furthermore, compliance and enforcement challenges are only made more difficult in the presence of aggressive opposition from vested commercial interests. 225 Ongoing monitoring, and strategies to strengthen the capacity of states to comply with their FCTC obligations, are two important ways to bolster the effect of this instrument.",

            "text": "Dietary salt reduction provides another good illustration of countries incorporating WHO guidance on non-communicable disease prevention, fitting global norms into their social, political, and regulatory contexts. High salt intake is estimated to be associated with nearly half of the disease burden ascribed to hypertension, a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality. [226] [227] [228] The physiological requirement for salt is less than 1 gram per day, 229 and WHO recommends less than 5 grams per day for adults. 230 Yet, in 2010, the global mean salt intake was twice this level, or 10 grams per person per day. 231 WHO's Global Action Plan has set a target of a 30% reduction of population-level salt intake by 2025. 232 Population salt reduction is among WHO's so-called best-buys to reduce chronic disease-an intervention that could lead to substantial health benefits as well as cost savings. 233, 234 In the USA, it has been estimated that a regulatory intervention designed to achieve a reduction in salt intake of 3 grams per day would save 194 000 to 392 000 quality-adjusted life-years and US$10-24 billion in health-care costs annually, and would be more costeffective than using medications to lower blood pressure in all people with hypertension. 235 From a population perspective, the most effective and equitable means of reducing salt consumption is to reduce the salt content of manufactured foods. 236, 237 In many countries, processed foods substantially contribute to salt intake, 238 regardless of any action individuals might take to reduce the salt they add to food. Countries are adopting population-level salt reduction strategies to achieve WHO's 30% reduction target by 2025. Many of these focus on reductions at the manufacturing level (reformulation), complemented by public information campaigns and nutrition labelling. The strategies also use diverse regulatory forms. In 2006, the UK became the first country to set salt targets for food composition. Using a voluntary approach, but with strong government leadership and oversight, UK manufacturers agreed to progressive reduction targets for around 80 categories of processed foods. Their reformulation efforts were supported by consumer education and improved food labelling. The approach was highly successful, resulting in a 15% decrease in salt intake across the population. 239 South Africa was the first country to set legislatively mandated salt reduction requirements across a wide range of processed foods. In March 2013, the South African Minister of Health issued the Regulations Relating to the Reduction of Sodium in Certain Foodstuffs and Related Matters. 240 The requirements took effect on June 30, 2016, with more stringent maximum levels coming into force on June 30, 2019. 240 Argentina has used a combination of voluntary and mandatory salt reduction techniques. Initially, the Ministry of Health and large food companies signed a voluntary agreement in 2011 to gradually and progressively reduce sodium in processed foods. 241 Voluntary targets were set according to the category of food, with reductions ranging between 5-18% over a 2-year period, and a government campaign supporting and encouraging behaviour change. In 2013, to build on the success achieved through the voluntary scheme, Argentina enacted a national law regulating the sodium content of processed foods. As of 2019, 83 countries have salt reduction strategies in place or planned, including 35 countries with voluntary targets and nine with mandatory, legislated targets. Almost all countries use a multifaceted regulatory approach, with 70 counties implementing, or planning to implement more than one type of strategy, and 33 countries incorporating legislative initiatives such as taxes, maximum limits, or warning labels. 242 Programmes are now being implemented in countries across all WHO regions and across countries with a broad range of income levels. 242 An example of these changes is described in the case study of the regulation of sugar-sweetened beverages (panel 7).",

Even a modest increase in physical activity could have significant health benefits: a brisk 20 minute walk each day could be enough to reduce an individual's risk of early death. 257 WHO recom mendations go further, recommending that adults undertake 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity, throughout the week. 258 Building on these findings and recommendations, an emerging body of evidence on legal and regulatory interventions is aimed at increasing physical activity.",

A gender equity dimension is also present, as women tend to be further disadvantaged in their opportunities for physical activity where cities are not walkable. 259 This is another area in which laws and regulations that affect population health might lie well outside the usual reach of health ministries, thus requiring intersectoral cooperation. In a 2009 review of the evidence, WHO found that modifying the built environment, policies that reduce barriers to physical activity (such as walking, biking, and recreation), transport policies, and increased space for recreational activity were all effective interventions. 260 Examples of effective laws and regulations to increase physical activity include urban planning, land use management and zoning, transport policy (including taxes on car use, availability and accessibility of public transport, and bicycle and walking paths), and road and traffic control. 261 Local governments can play an important role because land use and zoning frequently fall under their remit. Local governments can implement building, zoning, and development regulations that encourage more physically active lifestyles: streets that are welcoming and safe for pedestrians and cyclists, facilities for public recreation (parks and playgrounds), and traffic calming measures. 15 The common theme among legal and regulatory interventions to prevent non-communicable diseases is that they promote small changes, across entire populations, for a mass impact. By simply changing a default option (eg, reducing salt in processed food, forbidding smoking in certain areas, or making public transport easier than car use), law has the power to facilitate profound changes in behaviour. Good laws can make healthier and safer behaviours the easier or normal choice. In conjunction with health promotion and awareness campaigns, countries can use law to support and encourage communities to resolve the problems arising from the shared risk factors of non-communicable diseases.",

            "text": "Sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs), generally defined as liquids with added sugars (soft drinks, sports beverages, energy drinks, sweetened waters) are a known contributor to a variety of non-communicable diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, non-alcoholic liver disease, tooth decay and cavities, and gout. 243 In response to the noncommunicable disease epidemic, countries have begun to regulate SSBs, primarily through excise taxes, which add a per ounce fee to the SSB sales price, although traditional sales taxes have sometimes been employed. 244, 245 The trend toward taxation has increased substantially over the past decade, and particularly during the past 5 years. As of 2019, more than a dozen countries, including France, the UK, Norway, Portugal, Chile, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Thailand, and Mexico, along with numerous localities, have adopted sugar taxes of varying scope and size. 246 Two of the most studied tax cases were in Mexico and Berkeley, California. Mexico was among the first countries to implement a substantial tax on SSBs, in 2014, levying a 10% excise tax on all SSBs except milk. Researchers found an immediate reduction in SSB consumption during the following years, with sales of SSBs falling by 5\u00b73% in 2014 and 9\u00b77% in 2015, while sales of untaxed beverages increased in 2014 and fell by only 1% in 2015. 247 In Berkeley, which adopted a 1 cent per ounce tax on SSBs, researchers found that SSB sales decreased by 9\u00b76% while untaxed beverage sales increased by 3\u00b75%, driven primarily by a 15\u00b76% increase in sales of bottled water. 248 Importantly, the tax did not seem to meaningfully affect overall consumer shopping habits, as average grocery bills did not increase, and Berkeley store revenue did not decrease compared with control cities. Multiple studies (in addition to those in Mexico and Berkeley) found that SSB taxes lead to moderate reductions in consumption, which could support positive downstream health outcomes. 249 WHO supports adoption of SSB taxes as a strategy to help combat non-communicable diseases, particularly obesity and diabetes, citing evidence that an SSB tax that increases consumer prices by 20% can lead to an approximate 20% reduction in consumption. 249 Crucially, researchers have cautioned that SSB taxes must be relatively high to reduce consumption; at lower levels retailers could elect to absorb the cost of the tax in order to retain customer business, particularly if customers are readily able to purchase comparable goods from a nearby retailer in a location without such a tax. 250 Supporters of SSB taxes often argue that improved population health resulting from SSB taxes will eventually reduce health-care costs. WHO cites estimates that, over 10 years, a tax on sugary drinks of 1 cent per ounce in the USA would result in more than US$17 billion in health-care cost savings. 249 Supporters argue that the revenue generated by SSB taxes can offset health-care expenses. For example, WHO cites estimates that an SSB tax of \u00a51 (US$0\u00b716) per litre in China would generate an estimated \u00a573\u00b76 billion (US$11\u00b78 billion) in revenue. 249 As policy makers have become more interested in taxation and other regulation of SSBs, so too has the beverage industry, adopting creative techniques to forestall new regulation. For example, in response to local efforts to implement SSB taxes within California (the largest state in the USA, with over 39 million residents), the beverage industry engaged in an aggressive and ultimately successful strategy to preempt local taxation authority. In California, the generally liberal state government would normally be unlikely to adopt a state wide ban on new soda taxes. However, in 2018, the beverage industry deployed a two-pronged effort to curb local SSB taxing authority, first, by financing a ballot initiative in support of a sweeping preemptive tax law 251,252 that would have been devastating to localities, and later, by agreeing to withdraw the proposed initiative if a more narrow food and beverage tax ban bill passed, a move that was characterised by some legislators as \"blackmail\" and \"being held hostage\". 253 The industry's forceful techniques were effective. In June, 2018, the California legislature passed a bill preempting any new local food or beverage taxes for 12 years, 254 joining Michigan and Arizona in adopting state wide bans on new soda taxes. Several other states in the USA have considered such bills, and the industry appears likely to continue to lobby in support of their passage in the USA and globally.",

Each year, 1\u00b724 million people die as a result of road traffic injuries, and a further 20 million to 50 million sustain non-fatal injuries. 263 Road traffic injuries are the leading cause of death among people aged 15-29 years. 264, 265 Evidence shows that legislating on five key behavioural risk factors-speeding, drink driving, helmet use, seat belt use, and child restraint use-could significantly reduce this toll. 266 The regulation of environmental and design factors, such as safer vehicles and roads, has also proved highly effective in preventing road crashes. Such interventions include energy-absorbing crumple zones on cars, passive restraints, visible roads with clear lane markings, traffic separation (eg, oncoming vehicles or bicyclists), and traffic calming (eg, roundabouts and speed bumps). However, few countries have systematically implemented laws that target behavioural risk factors and design features, or laws that implement best practices. In particular, low-income and middle-income countries often have substandard laws, and poor compliance and enforcement. 267 Global health institutions can establish norms that promote the uptake of such laws. Efforts to define technical standards for safety and to conduct policy surveillance of national road safety laws can be effective in helping to spread better laws. For example, seatbelts are a proven way to reduce road traffic injuries and have been mandatory in northern Europe and the USA since the 1970s. 268, 269 In 2004, the WHA adopted resolution WHA57.10, recommending that member states implement mandatory seatbelt laws. The following year, the UN General Assembly adopted its own resolution, A/60/5, similarly calling for mandatory seatbelt legislation. Since then, there has been a significant increase in the number of states that have legislated for national mandatory seatbelt use. 270 Botswana, Cuba, and Kyrgyzstan had a notable drop in road fatalities after mandating seatbelt use for all vehicle occupants.",

Helmet laws have been proven to be highly effective, reducing the risk of head injuries by 69% and the risk of death by 37%. 271 In 1997, Taiwan introduced legislation making it compulsory to wear a motorcycle helmet. The government supported this legislation with, on one hand, a public information campaign, and on the other, strict fines for both riders and passengers. 272 The results have been powerful: between 1991 and 2008, motorcycle-related deaths almost halved (from 7322 to 3646), despite an increase in both motorcycle use and crashes during the same period. In 2007, Vietnam introduced a similar law, 273 supported by large fines for non-compliance. The Ministry of Health in Vietnam and WHO reported that road traffic head injuries and deaths had decreased by 16% and 18%, respectively, 3 years after the law was introduced. 274",

In these settings, such laws are inequitably enforced, fail to meet any tangible public health objective -ie, reduce rates of HIV transmission 277 -and additionally, embed stigma and punish people for engaging in common behaviours such as sexual activity. The result is that individuals are driven underground, preventing them from accessing treatment, and potentially placing the broader community at risk. 275 Similarly, criminal laws have also posed barriers to the treatment and rehabilitation of people who use drugs (panel 8).",

Some of the most severe drug-related harms are associated with injecting drug use. Outside of sub-Saharan Africa, up to 30% of all new HIV infections occur among people who inject drugs with unsafe injecting practices. 285 In fact, HIV prevalence in countries that rely on punitive approaches is substantially higher (37-42% vs less than 5%) than countries that use public health approaches to drug use. 275 Furthermore, criminalisation has also been used to limit access to treatment options. Drug control efforts often have a disproportionate effect on vulnerable groups and marginalised communities, including indigenous populations, the poor, and racial or ethnic minorities. 286 In some countries, including the USA, treatment for hepatitis C has been restricted on the basis of a person's active injecting status. Criminalisation has also resulted in reduced access to disease prevention interventions, and proliferation of high-risk drug use behaviours in the absence of accessible harm reduction technologies. and exposure of the mother to Zika virus during pregnancy. 304 In 2016, WHO recommended that women in countries where Zika virus infection is a threat should delay pregnancy for several months to several years. 305 However, at the same time, several affected countries have strict barriers to accessing abortion, including laws that criminalise abortion for any purpose. 306 Women are consequently placed in an untenable position and can face a violation of their human rights. Such laws endanger the health of women, especially those who seek unsafe abortions because of the lack of access to legal abortion services.",

Approximately 15-20% of the world's population have one or more mental or substance use disorders; 289 in 2016, approximately 1\u00b71 billion individuals had a mental or substance use disorder. Some argue that the true burden of mental health and substance use disorder is even higher because of factors such as difficulties in accurate measurement and reporting, along with challenges in categorisation of overlapping conditions. 290 Mental health is neglected in most countries, particularly in relation to physical health conditions. Individuals with mental health disorders face pervasive stigma and discrimination, resulting in considerable disparities between the services available for physical and mental health, with decreased availability, accessibility, and quality of mental health services. 290 Although countries vary widely in access to mental health services, even the best performing systems have yet to meet the need, leaving a wide treatment gap between the need for treatment and actual service delivery. Estimates range from 76% to 85% of people with mental disorders not receiving treatment in low-income and middle-income countries, compared with 50% of comparable individuals in high-income countries. 291 WHO has identified the development of mental health policies and laws that promote human rights as crucial to the protection of people with mental health disorders, observing that such policies and laws are inadequate in most countries. 292 WHO's Mental Health Action Plan 2013-20 set a target that 50% of countries should have developed or updated their mental health laws in line with international and regional human rights instruments by 2020. 293 Although successful mental health policy involves myriad components, a foundational issue is access to affordable, quality mental health services, which requires laws supporting such access along with adequate funding for services. Historically, countries devoted their scarce mental health resources almost exclusively to high-cost inpatient services for relatively few acute cases, which has contributed to the treatment gap. As evidence has shown the effectiveness of community-based outpatient treatment and integration of mental and physical health services, countries are slowly transitioning their laws and policies accordingly.",

India has traditionally underfunded its mental health services, spending only 0\u00b706% of its total health expenditures on outpatient mental health care, 297 and has a severe shortage of mental health providers, even when compared with other low-income and middle-income countries. 298, 299 Among the new law's provisions is a requirement that insurers cover mental and physical health services in parity, which supporters hope will help combat the stigma surrounding treatment and lead to improved mental health outcomes.",

Too often, governments have used law for improper purposes, or with little consideration for the values of health with justice. In such cases, law can raise risks and create stigma. Inappropriate use of the criminal law has been deeply harmful in multiple spheres. For these reasons, policy makers should monitor and evaluate the effects of law on health and on justice. Legal determinant 3 encapsulates the need for ongoing evaluation of public health laws, ensuring that laws and Nowadays, the world is facing the highest levels of displacement on record. 307 With an unprecedented 68\u00b75 million people around the world forced from their homes-of whom, nearly 25\u00b74 million are refugees and 10 million are stateless people-the origins and consequences of the displacement crisis remain some of the most formidable challenges of our modern time. 307 Attempting to address the myriad challenges that face refugees and asylum seekers across the world, the international community, by way of international law and treaties, has sought to foster norms on how countries treat refugees. The core instruments of international refugee lawthe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and the 1967 Protocol 308 -provide protection for refugees by prohibiting refoulment of refugees, or forcible returning of refugees to places where they fear for their lives or freedom. 309 Although the law has taken important steps to protect the wellbeing of refugees, profound gaps persist and negatively affect the rights and experiences of refugees, particularly with respect to health. Yet even more troublingly, laws and policies themselves can hinder health outcomes and contravene well established public health principles. This twin dynamic of unmet need and avoidable harm is exemplified in national laws and policies surrounding refugees and tuberculosis. 310 From the start of the journey, through to arrival at the country of asylum, refugees and others who are subject to forced migration are susceptible to contracting tuberculosis. This vulnerability begins with refugees' experiences in their home country, where health-care infrastructure might be lacking or have broken down because of war. For example, before the 2011 crisis began, Syria had a relatively low burden of tuberculosis. 311 Although data regarding tuberculosis in Syria remains elusive, reports show a rapid rise of the disease in the country, which is still believed to only be a fraction of the actual burden. 311, 312 After refugees leave their home country, the journey exacerbates their susceptibility to tuberculosis. Economic, social, and legal barriers increase the likelihood that tuberculosis will spread along the way and block access to care for those who contract it. These barriers, in turn, can lead to increases in the prevalence of tuberculosis in countries of asylum. Lebanon has been a country of asylum for Syrian refugees from the start of the conflict in 2011. 313 In the first year of receiving Syrian refugees, Lebanon saw a 27% increase in tuberculosis cases. 311 Reflecting this dynamic, countries enact national laws and policies regarding migrants and tuberculosis. For instance, some countries will not provide essential medical services to migrants with tuberculosis, some have legal requirements that individuals with tuberculosis undergo treatment as a condition of attaining legal status, and many detain and deport individuals who have or develop tuberculosis, frequently without providing necessary treatment. 310 In the USA, active tuberculosis is still one of the communicable diseases that trigger inadmissibility under the Immigration and Nationality Act, though a waiver may be possible. 314 These national restrictions based on tuberculosis claim public health as a justification, but directly contravene established public health principles and violate international law.",

These obligations include non-discrimination on the basis of other status, which includes health status. If states do indeed opt to limit rights, states must show that the limitations are necessary to achieve a legitimate aim, that the means achieve the stated aim, and that they are the least restrictive means. 318 their implementation are evidence-based, fair, intersectoral, and transparent.

Therefore, health officials might lack the mandate and legal powers to implement new, evidence-based inter ventions. Outdated laws and existing interventions might stigmatise or penalise vulnerable individuals and communities, driving epidemics underground. Secondly, new and emerging health hazards might require new legislative frameworks. Public health laws are often introduced reactively, and then stay on the books for decades. In the face of emerging threats-whether novel pandemics, or new paradigms such as non-communicable diseases-these laws might not be fit for purpose. Conversely, an ambitious goal like achieving UHC calls for forward planning and proactive regulation. The WHO capacity building report also stated that governments might lack the legislative and regulatory tools to discharge their public health and human rights responsibilities effectively. Public health officials need a wide-ranging set of powers to carry out their responsibilities to safeguard the population. At the same time, the law must protect the civil and political rights of individuals, as well as their social, economic, and cultural rights, including nondiscrimination and equal protection under the law.

This idea goes far beyond education or health promotion: rather, it means that affected communities should be genuine partners in, rather than targets of, health policy. The global response to HIV and AIDS provides the most powerful illustration of community mobilisation. In the face of stigma, discrimination, and neglect, advocates raised social and political awareness, which ultimately generated the political will to take action. They demanded high quality research into the prevention and treatment of HIV infection. When interventions were developed, they advocated for the right to affordable access throughout the world.

These governance mechanisms can incentivise public participation and help \"dispel potential concerns of suspicion or mystification that might surround the development of public health laws\". 327 Public participation and open forums also enable civil society to understand the purpose of health law and engage more effectively in the policy process. In turn, this can support adherence to the norms and standards established by health laws. For example, in Denmark, public health groups worked with the government, industry bodies, and civil society organisations, to raise public awareness of the cardiovascular risks of consuming artificial trans fats. 328, 329 This type of public engagement meant that when regulation limiting these harmful fats was introduced in 2003, it already had a high level of public confidence and support, and strong industry compliance-ultimately leading to a successful public health legal intervention.",

Elsewhere, the food industry has spent lavishly to influence legislative processes on issues ranging from menu labelling to taxes on sweetened beverages. 331 Furthermore, as sales of unhealthy foods in higherincome countries have begun to lag, food companies are expanding their markets in developing countries by targeting community networks.

For example, it might rigorously examine whether a law is correlated with a particular health outcome, or compare outcomes in jurisdictions that have implemented similar or different laws-noting that contextual factors will mean that success in one jurisdiction will not necessarily predict success in a neighbouring jurisdiction. Comparison of health effects before and after implementation of a law is also a useful research tool.

The NSP provided sterile drug injection equipment and facilities for the safe disposal of used equipment. The programme also became a first point of contact between injecting drug users and health services, providing education, information, and onward referrals to drug treatment, medical care, and legal and social services. 337 Evaluations of NSPs in Australia found them to be \"the single most important and cost-effective strategy in reducing drug-related harms among [persons who inject drugs]\", 338 and the programme has been endorsed by WHO, UNAIDS, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. Yet initially, experts and policy makers faced intense opposition. The evidence was not watertight, but policy makers had to act decisively to stem a potential epidemic. In doing so, they were guided by human rights principles and the need to protect a susceptible community. Once adopted, programmes such as NSPs can and should be subject to rigorous empirical examination. As of 2019, we have robust evidence that NSPs help prevent the transmission of blood-borne diseases and save lives. As observed with so many public health successes, the lack of complete evidence did not act as a barrier to innovation.

Health diplomacy requires the ability to genuinely listen to the concerns of stakeholders, while identifying common ground and finding fair and innovative ways to coax the parties toward consensus. WHO explains that global health diplomacy \"brings together the disciplines of public health, international affairs, management, law, and economics, and focuses on negotiations that shape and manage the global policy environment for health\". 343 Effective health diplomacy can operate at the national level (eg, negotiations over new legislation or regulations, especially where health considerations need to be integrated in non-health legislation) and at the trans national level (eg, negotiations over new health treaties, global action plans, or codes of practice). The complex negotiations over the FCTC, the IHR, or the PIP Framework all provide good examples of the need for skilful health diplomacy. Academic institutions can partner with governments and international organisations to fill these gaps in knowledge and skills. For instance, academic institutions could help train the workforce charged with implementing health laws and international agreements.",

The FCTC explicitly calls for legal capacity building and knowledge sharing in litigating tobacco control cases, such as defending strong tobacco control laws or suing tobacco companies for deception or unfair marketing. These calls have been realised through the efforts of professional groups (eg, the so-called lawyer's circle for tobacco control, which connects legal expertise in highincome countries with that in low-income and middleincome countries), civil society (eg, the Framework Convention Alliance, made up of 500 member groups worldwide), and philanthropies (eg, the Bloomberg International Legal Consortium, which provides resources for legal capacities in tobacco control). Earlier we mentioned food industry opposition to new laws facilitating healthier population diets. Ensuring that the food industry does not undermine efforts to protect public health could be another area in which crossjurisdictional networking would be particularly valuable.
