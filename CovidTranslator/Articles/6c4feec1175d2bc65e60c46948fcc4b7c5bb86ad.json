Infectivity-neutralizing (IN) and hemagglutinin-inhibiting (HAI) antibodies induced by RBCV infections were monitored in sequential serum samples collected from cattle during a naturally evolving and experimentally monitored epizootic of shipping fever pneumonia (SFP). Cattle nasally shedding RBCV at the beginning of the epizootic started with low levels of serum IN and HAI antibodies. An increase in serum IN antibody after day 7 led to reduction of virus shedding in nasal secretions by the majority of the cattle between days 7 and 14. A substantial rise in the serum HAI antibody was observed during the initial phase among the sick but not the clinically normal cattle which were infected with RBCV. The RBCV isolation-positive cattle that developed fatal SFP had minimal serum IN and HAI antibodies during the course of disease development. Cattle that remained negative in RBCV isolation tests entered this epizootic with high levels of serum IN and HAI antibodies, which dramatically increased during the next two weeks. Protection against SFP was apparently associated with significantly higher levels of serum IN antibodies at the beginning of the epizootic. The RBCV-neutralizing activity is associated with serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), particularly the IgG2 subclass, while RBCV-specific HAI antibody is related to both serum IgG and IgM fractions.",

The viral RNA genome is associated with the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) to form a helical nucleocapsid. Four structural proteins are part of the lipoprotein envelope: (i) membrane glycoprotein (M), (ii) S glycoprotein, (iii) HE glycoprotein, and (iv) the recently identified E protein. Specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against EBCV glycoproteins S and HE inhibited virus infectivity, indicating that both glycoproteins elicit neutralizing antibodies in EBCV infections (4, 5, 9) . The N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid was identified as the receptor determinant to which both S and HE bind in initiating infection and in agglutinating rodent erythrocytes. The S glycoprotein is considered to be the major viral structural protein to bind to the neuraminic acid-containing receptors (22, 23) . Binding of HE glycoprotein to this determinant residue on the cell surface was suggested to function as a prereceptor interaction for EBCV (19, 24) . The HE of EBCV also has receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE) function which is mediated by the AE potentially eluting adsorbed virions (24, 29) . MAbs differentiated HE functions into hemagglutinin (HA) and RDE activities through relatively low activity inhibiting HA but high titers of activity inhibiting the RDE (30, 35) .",

As reported 105 6-to 8-month-old cattle were included in the epizootic occurring in 1997 (25, 26) and subjected to nasal and blood sampling and testing at the time of assembly at an order-buyer barn (day 0), after transport (day 7), and weekly throughout the pathogenesis of SFP (days 14, 21, 28, and 35). Nasal swab samples were taken for virological and bacteriological studies, while blood samples for serum harvest were collected for immunological investigation. These cattle were classified into five response groups based on clinical signs of respiratory tract diseases and results of RBCV isolation (14, 25, 26) . Response group 1 included 72 cattle that exhibited clinical signs of respiratory tract disease and were nasally shedding RBCV on day 0, day 7, or both. Seven cattle shedding RBCV on day 7 were randomly chosen from this response group for testing in this study. Response group 2 contained five test cattle that secreted RBCV in nasal discharges without adverse respiratory signs. Ten cattle of response group 3 developed severe pneumonia and died on days 7 to 11, and nine that nasally shed RBCV were selected. Eighteen cattle remained RBCV isolation negative. Eleven of them were included in response group 4 because they had fever and other respiratory signs, while the remaining seven calves (response group 5) remained clinically healthy during the 5-week investigation. Samples of seven representative cattle from response groups 4 and 5 were serologically analyzed. Sequential serum samples from the selected 35 cattle were analyzed for their IN and HAI antibodies.",

The serum IN antibody level was initially low and significantly increased after day 7, with a simultaneous decline of nasal RBCV shedding in most cattle within a week. Intranasal vaccination of calves with modified live virus of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis induced neutralizing activity in the serum by day 21 (12) . This finding, along with our previous studies on the antigenicity of RBCV structural proteins by immunoblotting assays (14) , highlights the importance of S and HE glycoproteins in inducting IN antibodies in RBCV infections, similar to reports on EBCV and human respiratory coronavirus infections (4, 5, 9, 21) . Serum HAI activity was higher than that of serum IN during the first week of this investigation. Our previous observation on the antigenicity of RBCV structural proteins in RBCV infections indicates that both HE and S are viral antigens recognized during the initial stages of the bovine immune response to RBCV infections (14) . The HE glycoprotein induced antibodies 1 week earlier than S glycoprotein, whereas S glycoprotein induced a more persistent antibody response. The structure favoring exposed epitopes and the abundance of the HE glycoprotein might have facilitated the early strong HAI antibody response (11, 13, 19) . Interestingly, a remarkable rise in the level of serum HAI activity was observed among the sick but not among clinically normal cattle between days 0 and 21. Immunologic injury, mediated largely through antibody to the S glycoprotein, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (3, 10, 17, 18) . Immune complex formation and complement deposition incite pyogranulomatous lesions of FIP, and MAbs to the S glycoprotein of FIP virus can enhance this infection of macrophages in vitro. Furthermore, purified S glycoprotein of EBCV was documented to exhibit higher HA activities with rodent RBC than purified HE glycoprotein (23, 24) . Therefore, we proposed that a rapid increase in the level of HAI antibody primarily against S glycoprotein could result in deposition of antibody-antigen complex and complement and aggravation of the RBCV infection as a possible pathologic mechanism of early disease enhancement.",

Importantly, a major difference between the cattle with and without signs of respiratory tract diseases was the serum IN antibody level during the first week. These clinically normal cattle had significantly higher IN levels than the cattle developing clinical signs, suggesting that a high level of IN antibody against RBCV enabled the cattle to resist RBCV infections more efficiently, thus preventing clinical signs of SFP.",

However, results of the correlation of serum IN and HAI activities with immunoisotype levels, along with the detailed illustrations in Fig. 1 , suggest that the IgG, especially IgG2, might contain the majority of the RBCV-specific IN activity in the bovine serum, whereas both IgG and IgM might play an important role in serum HAI activity. This result implies that detection of serum RBCV-specific HAI antibodies is more useful at the early stage of RBCV infection, whereas monitoring of serum RBCV-specific IN activity may be a better indicator of overall outcome of disease development. These results further indicate that measurement of RBCV-specific IgG, particularly IgG2, may provide a good estimate of protective IN antibody levels.",
