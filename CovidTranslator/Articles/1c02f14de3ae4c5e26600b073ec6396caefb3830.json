Chinazzi et al. suggested that the travel ban delayed the overall epidemic progression of COVID-19 in China by 3-5 days, and may reduce the number of cases outside of China by 80% by the end of February [4] .

Using web scraping technique, we obtained the Baidu Migration Index data for outbound traffic from Wuhan to the 31 Chinese provinces from January 10 to February 29, 2020.

With these data, we estimated the volume of daily traffic from Wuhan to each province, calculated as Volume province,date = Total Volume date \u00d7 Percentage province,date .

Longer time lag between traffic volume and COVID-19 incidence was observed in provinces closer to Wuhan or with more population influx from Wuhan, such as Henan, Jiangxi, Shanghai, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Sichuan. Longer lagged effect does not mean these provinces were less responsive to imported cases. Rather, it means the overall changes in cumulative incidence in these provinces were not only driven by imported cases but also infected cases through local transmissions. For example, the lag was estimated to be 23 days for Henan province, which was severely affected by COVID-19. Although Henan province was among the earliest to implement traffic control, the COVID-19 incidences grew steadily after the traffic control. It is possible that the influx of Wuhan emigrants, mostly people who returned home from work/school, led to significant local transmissions in Henan, which outweighed the imported cases in driving the cumulative incidence to grow for a prolonged period. Given the median incubation period of 4-6 days for COVID-19 [11] , the overall COVID-19 incidence in provinces with lags of 2-3 weeks, or approximately 2-3 times the median incubation period, could be reflective of the second-or third-generation transmissions.
