Diarrhea may be multifactorial in etiology including management and nutritional factors as well as a variety of pathogens. Most of the pathogens involved affect other livestock species and some have host-adapted strains. However, the clinical signs, their expected severity and age of onset of disease varies between species in some cases. The most common pathogens causing diarrhea in neonatal camelids are coronavirus, Escherichia coli (E. coli), Cryptosporidium spp., Giardia spp. and coccidia. The purpose of this paper is to review the available literature on neonatal diarrhea in camelids and to present clinical data from 55 cases seen at The Ohio State University.",

            "text": "Diarrhea is an important disease in neonatal llamas (Lama glama) and alpacas (Lama pacos). One study found that diarrhea was the most common cause of morbidity in the pre-weaning period, affecting some 23% of crias (Sharpe et al., unpublished data, 2000) . This study monitored 250 crias on four farms over a 5-year period. Commercialization of alpaca breeding in the North America, Australia and Europe, for fiber production has led to increased stocking densities \u0b1d This paper is part of the special issue entitled Special Issue on inevitably exposing young stock to higher concentrations of potential pathogens. Nutritional factors, such as overfeeding of bottle-fed orphans, may play a role but infectious pathogens are an increasingly important factor in neonatal diarrhea. A knowledge of the types of agents involved and at what age these infectious agents are likely to cause disease is important in deciding which diagnostic tests to perform and in initiating treatment. Additionally, the clinician must realize that failure to reach a diagnosis and treat the cause of diarrhea effectively will often lead to chronic diarrhea which may ultimately result in chronic renal failure. Failure to receive sufficient immunoglobulins from colostrum during the first 12 h of life predisposes the neonate to bacterial, viral and protozoal agents but each tends to have a characteristic clinical presentation and this may help guide the clinician with regard to Table 1 Pathogen isolated from crias with diarrhea in two different studies Pathogen Cebra et al.

Coccidiosis is typically associated with overcrowding and poor hygiene. The pathogenesis and severity of the clinical signs observed may be associated with the number of coccidia ingested. Re-infections from a contaminated environment can cause an excessive coccidia burden that may be fatal (Fowler, 1998) . Following ingestion of sporulated oocysts, motile stages called sporozoites are released which penetrate epithelial cells in the small intestine. The sporozoites then undergo both sexual and asexual reproductive stages producing oocysts which are shed in the feces. The oocysts cause direct damage to the epithelial mucosa of the small intestine resulting in enteritis and diarrhea. Tenesmus may be observed. Diarrhea may be hemorrhagic and contain shreds of sloughed mucosa. As a result, nutrient malabsorption and subsequent poor growth ensue. Cheney and Allen (1989) report that since the lesions are primarily in the small intestine, fresh blood is rarely seen in affected llamas.",

            "text": "The life cycle is not particularly well-established for coccidia specific to SACs. However, Foreyt (2001) lists prepatent periods for four out of the five species that affect South American Camelids. These vary from as little as 10 days for E. punoensis to 33-34 days for E. macusaniensis. The prepatent periods for E. alpacae and E. punoensis were established from experimental data using fecal samples from four llamas (Foreyt and Lagerquist, 1992) . The authors have seen clini-cal coccidiosis in alpacas as early as 21 days of age. Identification of the particular species involved in this case was not performed but such an early appearance of clinical disease suggests that neonates exposed to contaminated environments can become infected in the first few days of life. Rosadio and Ameghino (1994) described an outbreak of coccidiosis on a farm in southern Peru that was suspected to have caused the deaths of 12 alpacas between 25 and 35 days of age. Eight of these cases had been observed with pre-mortem diarrhea, four others had died suddenly. At necropsy, all of the carcasses were observed to be thin and dehydrated. Gross examination revealed gas-distended intestines with reddened intestinal mucosa throughout the small intestine and the mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged. Histopathologically, there was partial ulceration and moderate necrosis of the small intestinal mucosa with shortened intestinal villi. Throughout the mucosa there were large numbers of sexual and asexual stages of a coccidian that was thought to be E. macusaniensis. These were causing marked disruption of the epithelial crypt glands. Cebra et al. (2003) isolated Eimeria spp. 6 of 45 (13%) unweaned llama or alpaca crias with diarrhea. The six crias were between 21 and 60 days old. The peak times for diarrhea case submissions corresponded with the wetter months of Fall and Winter and at these times, coccidia were isolated more frequently. A case of coccidiosis and leptospirosis was reported in a 3-monthold guanaco (Hodgin et al., 1984) . In this particular case, the cria died without pre-or post-mortem evidence of diarrhea and lesions of subacute enteritis with associated coccidian reproductive stages were confined to a relatively small portion (60 cm) of jejunum. The coccidiosis was not thought to have contributed to the death of this cria. Costarella and Anderson (1999) reported a case of ileocecocolic intussusception in a 1month-old llama cria. A fecal examination had revealed many coccidial oocysts but there had been no signs of diarrhea and a causal relationship was considered but could not be established.",

Amprolium inhibits differentiation of merozoites by acting on first generation schizonts in the small intestine (Bennett et al., 2001) . It does not kill the merozoites: these enter the sexual reproductive phase which ultimately produces oocysts. Therefore, an animal treated with amprolium will still excrete viable oocysts.

Consideration should be given to application of preventative measures before and during stressful events such as weaning, shearing or herd movements. Amprolium may be used prophylactically and is added to water at 5 mg/kg body weight daily over a 21-day period. Correct dosage of amprolium is important since overdosing causes thiamine deficiency and can produce clinical polioencephalomalacia. Alternatively, decoquinate may be used more safely added into feed at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days.

Following attachment, the bacteria then produce either heat-labile (LT) or heat-stable (ST) toxins resulting in increased secretion of water and electrolytes by the intestinal cells (hypersecretory diarrhea). Villous atrophy and sloughing of enterocytes may occur due to hypovolemia, ischemia and circulatory problems in the host-rather than being a specific effect of the bacterial toxins themselves. If E. coli infection occurs concurrently with rotavirus or coronavirus infection, then the villous atrophy may be extensive and severe. Different combinations of virulence factors (fimbriae and enterotoxins) determine the classification of ETEC strains, the majority of which are plasmid-encoded. Commonly-known fimbriae are K88, K99 and F41 while STa is the enterotoxin found in cattle isolates.

Cryptosporidium oocysts are extremely resistant to decay in the environment and to most disinfectants. As few as 10 oocysts can induce disease in susceptible individuals while clinically affected calves can shed greater than 10 10 oocysts during infections forming a significant source of infection for other animals (Tzipori and Ward, 2002) . Additionally, asymptomatic adult cattle are thought to be a major source of environmental contamination. The exact mechanism by which Cryptosporidium attaches and invades enterocytes is poorly understood at the present time. However, it is known that following attachment, Cryptosporidium forms a parasitophorous vacuole within the host cell (intracellular but extracytoplasmic) bounded by a parasitophorous vacuolar membrane derived from the host cell membrane. This protects the organism from the hostile environment of the gut lumen as well as the host cell's defenses. An additional \"feeder organelle membrane\" in Cryptosporidium, as opposed to other coccidian parasites, is thought to be primarily responsible for nutrient uptake from the host cell. Inclusion of Cryptosporidium within enterocytes reduces gastrointestinal absorption in affected individuals due to loss of epithelium, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (malabsorptive diarrhea). Maldigestion also occurs as a result of the loss of membrane-bound digestive enzymes such that weight loss and emaciation in neonates is typical. Autoinfection can occur. The authors have diagnosed renal failure in multiple crias with cryptosporidiosis. The mechanism of kidney damage is presumed to be prolonged states of subclinical dehydration leading to reduced renal perfusion and tubular necrosis.",

Paromomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that has been used in human cases but studies appear to disagree regarding its efficacy (Tzipori and Ward, 2002) . One study showed that it was no more effective than placebo for treating cryptosporidiosis in patients with advanced HIV infection (Hewitt et al., 2000) . Several studies have been performed in animals but the results are inconsistent. In one trial, prophylactic paromomycin administration did not reduce the incidence of disease in treated calves but appeared to increase the pre-patent period (Grinberg et al., 2002) . A field trial conducted in infected lambs showed significant reduction in excretion of oocysts in lambs treated with paromomycin (100 or 200 mg/kg once daily for 3 consecutive days) as well as a reduction in clinical symptoms (Viu et al., 2000) .

Coronavirus was the most common pathogen causing diarrhea in unweaned crias in one recent study (Cebra et al., 2003) . It was identified by electron microscopy in 42% of cases and affected 64% of herds studied with an age distribution from 10-150 days at the time of diagnosis. In the same study, this was the only pathogen involved in outbreaks that also affected adults. Coronavirus also was found to cause diarrhea at any time of the year in contrast to coccidiosis which was more prevalent in wetter times of year (Fall and Spring). In contrast, rotavirus was found in only 2% (1/45) of cases. Parre\u00f1o et al. (2001) investigated the presence of rotavirus and coronavirus in two farms of captured guanacos in Patagonia (Argentina). Both farms suffered severe diarrhea outbreaks with a morbidity rate of 100% and a mortality rate of 83%. Animals were between 1 day and 4 months of age at time of capture, kept in small yards and raised on powdered cow's milk. In all cases, disease was acute in onset and the feces were dark-green. Affected animals were 7-40 days old. Death occurred within 2-6 days after dehydration. Rotavirus was detected in the feces of two neonates (aged 2 and 7 days). Analysis of 52 fecal samples from healthy or convalescent animals for rotavirus antigen taken about 30 days after the peak of the outbreak were all negative; however, all animals except the two neonates were positive for rotavirus antibody by ELISA. This included the healthy animals giving total herd prevalences of 95% in both farms. The same animals were all negative for bovine coronavirus antigen in feces and antibody in serum by ELISA. Puntel et al. (1999) conducted a serological survey for a variety of viruses including bovine rotavirus on 390 llamas in 9 Argentinean farms. Antibody prevalence for rotavirus was 88% and involved all farms tested. The authors surmised that these findings suggest a high susceptibility of llamas to bovine rotavirus. No clinical cases of diarrhea were reported on the farms of study. Mattson (1994) reported detection of coronavirus by electron microscopy in 2 young llamas, aged 12 days and 9 months, presented with diarrhea.",

In crias aged less than 7 days, diarrhea is most likely to be caused either by nutritional factors in bottle-fed neonates or by gram negative infections, especially when colostrum ingestion has been inadequate. In the latter situation, the diarrhea is likely to be accompanied by septicemia and affected crias will be quite ill. Viral diarrhea rarely affects crias younger than 7 days and in the US is mostly due to coronavirus. Cryptosporidium and giardia also affect crias aged 7 days or older and these pathogens tend to be more of a problem on large farms. However, the common practice of moving females with their crias during the neonatal period for breeding purposes with inadequate quarantine provision may result in infections on small units also. In addition, giardia may be a problem on farms using surface ponds as their water supply. Coccidiosis does not seem to occur in crias younger than 3 weeks but must be addressed as a herd issue when it is recognized. Diarrhea caused by gastrointestinal parasites is unlikely in crias younger than 2 months. It is important to recognize that multiple pathogen disease occurs, especially with cryptosporidium and this may affect treatment options and rate of recovery. Diagnostic tests are available for all of these pathogens and appropriate testing will aid the clinician in directing treatment for the individual and in helping to control the spread of disease among susceptible animals in the herd.",
