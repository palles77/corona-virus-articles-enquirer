These infectious viruses have been identified as hemorrhagic fever viruses (Lassa, Ebola), novel coronaviruses including severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome MERS-CoV), and highly pathogenic influenza. Coronaviruses (CoVs), as a class of enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus, cause various diseases in humans. CoVs are subdivided into four groups: Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus (\u03b2CoV), Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Two novel \u03b2CoVs, severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), have recently emerged and can induce a high mortality. The current outbreak of novel coronavirus COVID-19 (HCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) declaring this outbreak a global pandemic. By March 15, 2020, infected cases had reached 81 048 in China and a total of 72 600 cases outside China have been reported to the WHO from 146 countries and territories (https://experience. a r c g i s . c o m / e x p e r i e n c e / 685d0ace521648f8a5beeeee1b9125cd).",

Transmission is thought to occur via touching infected surfaces (skin-to-skin, touching infected inanimate objects) then mediating the COVID-19 infection through the mouth, nose, or eyes. Transmission can also be through inhalation of exhaled virus in respiratory droplets. It has been reported that infectious viruses, including coronavirus, can survive for long periods outside of its host organism. 2 COVID-19 virus is thought to survive for several hours on surfaces such as aluminum, sterile sponges, or latex surgical gloves, increasing the opportunity for transmission via touch. Transmission via the inhalation of small, exhaled respiratory droplets may occur as the aerosol droplets remain airborne for prolonged periods, mediating long-range humanto-human transmission via air movement. The relative contributions of large respiratory droplets, smaller airborne aerosol, or direct surface contacts to the transmissibility of COVID-19 still need to be evaluated to enable a fully effective control of transmission and infection.",

Infected stools in wastewater can generate further transmission routes through the generation of virus-laden aerosols during wastewater flushing. It was reported that a contaminated faulty sewage system in a high-rise housing estate in Hong Kong in 2003 was linked to the SARS outbreak of a large number of residents living in the surrounding buildings. 4 Therefore, the role of the aerosol from contaminated sewage in the transmission of COVID-19 should be investigated.",

Inhalation of virus-laden fine particles could transport the virus into deeper alveolar and tracheobronchial regions, which could increase the chance of infective transmission. Adsorption of the COVID-19 virus on airborne dust and PM could also contribute to long-range transport of the virus Therefore, investigations on adsorption, survival, and behavior of the COVID-19 virus with the surface of PM are needed to help to understand the role of air PM pollution in COVID-19 transmission.",

The high levels of PM pollution in China may increase the susceptibility of the population to more serious symptoms and respiratory complications of the disease. In addition, oxidant pollutants in air can impair the immune function and attenuate the efficiency of the lung to clear the virus in lungs. The simultaneous inhalation of chemical pollutants in PM alongside COVID-19 virus may also exacerbate the level of COVID-19 infection. Pro-inflammation, injury, and fibrosis from inhaled PM combined with an immune response or cytokine storm induced by COVID-19 infection could enhance the infection severity. Larger numbers of patients displaying more serious infection symptoms also created an increased risk of enhanced transmission potential. Therefore, the mechanisms underlying the impact and modulation of air pollution on COVID-19 severity and onward transmission warrant further investigation.",

In the future, this novel coronavirus may also become a seasonal infectious virus.
