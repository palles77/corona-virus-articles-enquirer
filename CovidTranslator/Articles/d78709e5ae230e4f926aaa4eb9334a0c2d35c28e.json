The research findings reveal that neither the government nor private organizations had any plans for dealing with the crisis before or after the event. It had both negative and positive impacts although its benefits were often overlooked. The overall implication of the study is that national culture, the level of economic development of a country, the availability of financial resources, and the ability and knowledge of its government officials and managers of private firms have a direct impact on how such an event is responded to and managed.",

Although a disagreement between the President and the Prime Minister triggered it, a weak coalition government, structural deficiencies, heavy external and internal borrowing, and ongoing corruption were the main reasons behind its severity (Walker 2002) . In order to rescue the country from economic and political chaos, Kemal Dervis, a senior executive from the World Bank, was appointed the minister responsible for the economy. He developed the ''Transition Toward a Strong Economy'' program (Walker 2002) , which introduced radical financial measures. In return, the International Monetary Fund provided loans of around $15 billion to help Turkey overcome the crisis.",

In particular, it focuses on determining whether tourism organizations or enterprises were able to predict the crisis, and what measures were taken to deal with it before, during, and after the event. In addition, the study evaluates how the government responded to it during and after the event.

There has been some discussion on the difference between a crisis and a disaster, with a blurred distinction between them. For example, according to S\u00f6nmez (1998) , the latter is an event which can cause loss of life, human suffering, property damage, and economic and social disruption. While the former appears to occur due to deficiencies in management, the other is triggered by sudden events over which people have little control and cause major suffering.",

            "text": "There are different categories of crises, including ecological, financial, regional, and global. Even if they are categorized under different names, important similarities exist among them, and one type can lead to other types (Kovoor-Misra, Clair and Bettenhausen 2001; Richardson 1994) . For example, ecological disasters, wars, and terrorist attacks can lead to economic and political problems, which then may result in a tourism crisis. The Gulf War in 1991, the civil war in the former Yugoslavia in the early 90s, ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident in China, political unrest in Fiji and Tibet, and the Iraq war in 2003 all had and have impacts on tourism in and around these countries. The September 11 terrorist attacks on America in 2001 The literature places much emphasis on preparation for crises, stating that the question is not whether or not such events will occur but when they occur, how one can respond to them, and how their negative impacts can be minimized (Kash and Darling 1998) . Different models are proposed to respond to crises and disasters (Faulkner 2001; Fink 1986; Kash and Darling 1998) . However, there are important similarities among them in terms of assumptions and recommendations. They recommend actions in four or five main stages: pre-crisis, acute crisis, chronic crisis, and resolution (Fink 1986; Kash and Darling 1998) . In the first stage, there are important duties to carry out, such as analyzing the external environment as an ongoing process, collecting data, interpreting the signals, making plans, forming a team, and establishing communication channels. The second begins when the symptoms of the crisis become apparent (Fink 1986) . At this stage, the extent of the event and its immediate and long-term effects should be assessed and appropriate measures should be taken immediately. During the third, the symptoms and impact of the event become more obvious than before, and it becomes essential to respond to them with appropriate actions. In the final stage, the symptoms of the crisis may gradually disappear and operations begin to return to normal. It is also possible that the actions to deal with the situation may not work, that further difficulties may be faced, and that the situation may worsen.",

At the same time, such events may also offer opportunities to introduce new products, management programs, new markets, and ways to reduce costs. Gaining experience and learning to handle the problems is seen as one of the key benefits for managers. According to Richardson (1994) , there are two types of learning. The first is single loop learning, which involves simple and incremental changes to prepare for future developments. The second is double loop learning, which refers to making radical changes in the strategies followed and management approaches employed. It is suggested that the former type is common and easy but that the latter is difficult and, although often necessary, ignored in many cases. For example, Bohn (2000) states that many organizations rush from one problem to another, never actually solving problems, just stopping them from getting worse and often failing to uncover their real roots. Uncovering the real roots and introducing radical changes can certainly facilitate double-loop learning and prevent some future unexpected situations (Roux-Dufort and Metais 1999) . 944 ",

Although all of these problems are important, the impact of national and global crises on the industry is particularly significant. These include the Gulf War in the early 90s, terrorism in Turkey in the 90s, the civil war in former Yugoslavia in the early 90s and an internal economic crisis in 1994, two earthquakes in the northwest region of Turkey in 1999, the February 2001 economic crisis, the attacks of September 11 on the United States, the war in Afghanistan against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, and the war on Iraq in 2003. These developments led to unexpected falls in demand and revenue in some years and an inability to maintain sustainable growth. On the other hand, governments have not been successful in responding to the above problems. As stated by G\u00f6ymen (2000) , all of the ''Five-Year State Development Plans'' have included a section for the industry, which identified key objectives related to the tourism development. However, the implementation process of these has not been really successful (Tosun 2001) . Since its formation in 1963, the Ministry of Tourism has not been very effective in designing and implementing sound regional and national plans (Tosun and Timothy 2001) . Although it operates offices in every city, its overall structure is centralized. Over 34 ministers were appointed between 1963 and 2003. In mid-2003, the Ministry of Tourism merged with the Ministry of Heritage, becoming the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism.",

Only 38 (35.8%) claimed to have predicted a possible crisis. Their preparation activities are presented in Table 1 . According to the results of the Mann-Whitney-U test, there was no statistically significant difference between the hotels in Bodrum and those in Nevsehir in terms of preparation activities. The results from the Kruskall-Wallis test indicated that (except for one item, ''reviewed our debts''), no statistically significant differences existed in preparation activities among the participant firms. The hotels in groups II and III seemed to have been much more concerned about their debts than those in group I. The 38 properties appeared to have taken only financial precautions, and none seem to have formed any management plans or teams in advance. These findings are perhaps not surprising because, reflecting the industry in general, the majority of the participants were small and mid-sized family-run businesses, which often lack the knowledge and resources to devote to formal training activities for learning and employing contemporary management practices. During the interviews, the respondents stated that they had failed to predict the crisis but they claimed that unexpected developments and disasters often broke out in and around Turkey; therefore, all of the firms in the industry were trying to survive. In their own mind, they were always trying to cut costs, improve quality, and be more cautious and conservative when deciding on new investments, believing this to be the true approach to crisis management. However, these activities were more reactive and tactical, and more like fighting a fire (Bohn 2000) , than proactive. Table 2 presents the findings on the actions taken by participating firms to deal with the crisis after it had broken out. The results from the Mann-Whitney-U test indicated that Bodrum and Nevsehir differed on four items: increased marketing and sales efforts; checked business agreements and contracts; spent more time on environmental scanning and prepared plans. On the other hand, when the Kruskull-Wallis test was applied, it was found that the three groups did not differ much from each other in terms of ranked scores, except on one item: spending more time on environmental scanning.",

There were no statistical differences between the two destinations concerning the items given in Table 5 , except for ''diminishing domestic demand'' and ''the loss of qualified staff to other sectors''. On the other hand, ANOVA indicated significant differences among the types of hotels in three items relating to the long-term negative impact: ''diminishing domestic demand'', ''the resultant image of Turkey as a cheap destination in international markets'', and ''qualified employees leaving the industry''. Hotels in group II seemed to have stronger views on these items than those in groups I and III, whereas on the last item groups II and III seemed to have stronger views. The main long-term positive impacts are presented in Table 6 . According to the results from the t-test, except for ''more attention will be given to marketing'', there were no differences between the two destinations regarding the items in Table 6 . Similarly, because ANOVA indicated no significant differences on the long-term positive impacts among the types of hotels, the test results were omitted. The study by Taylor and Enz (2002) reveals that the tragic events of September 11 in the United States affected hotel segments in different ways; for example, high-priced hotels experienced a greater decline in business than budget ones. Upscale hotels relied on marketing strategies to attract new customers, while budget ones offered discounts. As presented above, the results of the current study indicate some differences between the destinations and among the hotel types in some items. However, there are more similarities than differences between the destinations and among types of firms in their responses to the event and their views of its short-and long-term positive and negative impacts. Although these two destinations are quite different in terms of product, market segment, and the customer profile, the similarities among the research results reveal that the impacts of the crisis did not differ much in relation to destination. The research results indicate important similarities between the short-and long-term negative effects, whereas few similarities can be seen between the short-and long-term positive impacts. When comparing both types of negative effects, it seems certain that these and their consequences are likely to be felt for several years. During the interviews, the respondents were asked how they could benefit from the crisis in the long term. It was understood that considering the negative effects of the crisis and the poor financial performance of firms over the years; it did not seem to be so easy for them to capitalize on positive effects. To capitalize on these, participating firms needed to undertake formal analyses and devote time, money, and human resources.",

In the case of Turkey, sound crisis preparation and strategies were all lacking. Therefore, the issue of incorporating them was unfortunately never raised. In terms of promoting Turkey, apart from routine and planned campaigns, no intensive marketing efforts were found to be organized in the main markets after the event. Concerning the impact of the crisis, the country perhaps did not need to promote itself as a safe place, but hosting a series of international special events could have promoted it as an attractive destination. Developing and maintaining good contacts with the international media, tour operators, travel agents, and the press would have been helpful. However, it is known that despite its unique and rich natural and historical attractions and relatively developed infrastructure, Turkey has failed to promote itself as an attractive destination both before and after the crisis.",

According to Mansfield (1999) , the Israeli government often failed to give support to tourism organizations during and after several crises. Henderson (1999) also notes that the National Tourist Organization in Singapore failed to support the industry during and after the Asian financial crisis. By contrast, Coles (2003) reports that in the case of the Food and Mouth Disease in the United Kingdom, regional tourism offices in the southwestern part of England where the disease had broken out sponsored marketing strategies that helped the region overcome the negative impacts of the crises. Marketing strategies supported by the government of Malaysia, according to de Sausmarez (2003) , helped to increase domestic and inbound tourism in the aftermath of the Asian financial turmoil. In the case of Turkey, the tourism industry did not receive any support from the government. It is worth noting that the industry faced this crisis (and several previous ones) but could not respond to it well because of major shortcomings in the governance.",

First, as stated by Kusluvan (2003) , a very large majority of tourism firms are family-run smallto-medium sized enterprises that often employ ad-hoc managerial practices in running their organizations.
