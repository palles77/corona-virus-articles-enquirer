            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV), a novel human betacoronavirus, was first isolated in 2012 following the fatality of a patient with severe acute respiratory infection in Saudi Arabia . The genomic sequencing and public release of that isolate enabled the development of several realtime reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR)-based assays to facilitate laboratory detection and confirmation of MERS-CoV RNA in clinical specimens. Screening assays have primarily targeted genomic regions upstream of the envelope gene (UpE), while confirmatory assays have targeted viral open reading frames 1a (ORF1a), ORF1b, or both (ORF1ab) (Corman et al., 2012a, b) . More recently, alternative genomic targets have included the nucleocapsid (N) (Lu et al., 2014) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genes (Corman et al., 2012b) . Following deployment of these molecular assays, reports of MERS-CoV cases continue to rise both regionally and globally. According to WHO statistics, as of 31 August 2016, a total of 1800 laboratory confirmed MERS-CoV cases including 640 related deaths have been reported in 27 countries. Rapid and reliable detection of MERS-CoV is therefore essential to controlling the spread of this emerging threat.",

During the initial stages of MERS-CoV spread, these assays enabled rapid diagnosis to support the public health response to MERS-CoV. However, as with other currently available commercial assays, evaluation of the clinical sensitivities of these kits has been limited to virus spiked mock samples or small numbers of clinical specimens from MERS-CoV infected cases. Due to the recent increase in commercially available MERS-CoV rRT-PCR kits (n = 16) (Pas et al., 2015) , there is a need to evaluate assay performances on different specimen types to better understand their diagnostic effectiveness.",

This included 34 archived NPOP swabs (in VTM) from 18 sequence-confirmed MERS-CoVpositive cases, and a further 200 randomly selected MERS-CoV-negative NPOP swabs. Aliquots of VTM from the original frozen NPOP tubes of these specimens were prepared in 2.0-mL tubes.

The researcher performing testing was blinded to the original MERS-CoV screening outcomes of these 234 specimens. The RealStar\u00ae MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assay was used as the gold standard.

Briefly, total nucleic acid was extracted as described in Section 2.2 above, except that an extraction (internal) control was added to each specimen. During the reverse transcription stage, complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized using the cDNA Synthesis Premix kit (Seegene). Two microliters of random hexamer and 8 \u03bcL of extracted RNA were added to prealiquoted tubes containing 10-\u03bcL cDNA synthesis master mix and amplified according to the manufacturers' instructions. Once complete, real-time respiratory virus detection reactions were set up using the RV16 TOM-A and TOM-B sets. These 2 master mixes together enable detection of the above 16 respiratory viruses and internal control. Duplicate 20-\u03bcL reaction volumes were set up containing 8 \u03bcL of cDNA, 5 \u03bcL of 4\u00d7 RV16 Primers (TOM-A or TOM-B), 5 \u03bcL of 4\u00d7 Anyplex\u2122 master mix, and 2-\u03bcL water. Amplification and detection were performed on the CFX96\u2122 system (BioRad) under the following conditions: activation at 50\u00b0C for 4 minutes; denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds; 60\u00b0C for 1 minute, and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. Catcher melting temperature analysis (CMTA) was performed by cooling the mixture to 55\u00b0C, maintaining the mixture at 55\u00b0C for 30 seconds, and heating the mixture from 55-85\u00b0C. CMTA was performed 3 times during amplification, after cycle numbers 30, 40, and 50. Fluorescence was continuously measured during the temperature increase stage.

However, the original GeneSig\u00ae assay (assay 3A) lacked sensitivity (41.2%; 14/34), particularly with specimens displaying low viral loads (high C T values on comparative assays). Comparatively, our modification of the GeneSig\u00ae protocol (assay 3B) improved MERS-CoV RNA detection to 73.5% (25/34).",

However, an actual \"gold standard\" is yet to be classified, with most assays relying on the 2 gene UpE/Orf1a signatures for screening and confirmation of MERS-CoV RNA. This comparative analysis of MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assays evaluates their clinical sensitivity and presents their C T values to enable a robust comparison of diagnostic assay performances on NPOP specimens under our testing conditions. Although C T values from different assays can be affected by various assay components and platforms used, our analyses of 34 URT specimens showed the TIB MolBiol\u00ae LightMix assays to be the most sensitive (94.12%), followed by the Anyplex\u2122 Seegene and GeneSig\u00ae protocols. Discordant results between the assays were seen with those specimens containing low virus concentrations (high C T values), reflecting differences in the limits of detection (LOD) . Evaluating the LOD is critical to preventing underdiagnoses of MERS-CoV infections, and should be a consideration when selecting a commercial assay for routine diagnostics. For these purposes, the European Virus Archive has produced quantitative standards for UpE and Orf1a. However, we were unable to obtain these standards during this investigation. Nevertheless, the TIB MolBiol\u00ae LightMix and GeneSig\u00ae protocols (Assays 2-3) produced some single gene-positive (indeterminate) results, which in a clinical diagnostic setting would require further confirmation by screening a secondary specimen (ideally from the LRT where a higher viral load is expected) before overall interpretation as \"MERS-CoV negative\". Additionally, the GeneSig\u00ae and Anyplex\u2122 Seegene assays also produced several negative classifications for our sequence-confirmed specimens. No such indeterminate or negative results were observed with the RealStar\u00ae assay.",

However, it is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia's policy to perform parallel screening for MERS-CoV and Influenza (A, B, and H1N1) in suspected MERS-CoV cases. For this reason, it would be easy to identify any potential cross-reactivity with this assay. Nevertheless, the TIB MolBiol\u00ae assay was the most efficient of all the assays, yielding amplification results within 45-50 minutes. This would be highly advantageous during an outbreak situation where turnaround time is critical.",

The EQA panel of 12 samples including 7 MERS-CoV-positive samples gave the RealStar\u00ae MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assay a sensitivity score of 100% and GeneSig\u00ae 83-92%. Our findings support this superior sensitivity of the RealStar\u00ae MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assay and the reduced sensitivity of the GeneSig\u00ae assay, even with our URT specimens. Reanalysis of our known positive specimens on the RealStar\u00ae MERS-CoV rRT-PCR assay showed consistently lower C T values for 76% (26/34) of specimens, enabling reliable MERS-CoV detection when other assays approached their \"diagnostic cutoff\".

The other 5 assays used in that study highlight the diversity in MERS-CoV test availability between Korea and Saudi Arabia. Kim et al. (2016) were able to utilize an updated version of the Anyplex\u2122 assay (although pre-CE-IVD approval), which detected UpE and internal control (versus version 1 of the assay used in our study which incorporated melt-peak analysis only). Nine LRT sputum specimens were used to determine assay sensitivities, a further 9 LRT specimens were used to evaluate the effects of PCR inhibition on positive results, and 28 nasopharyngeal swabs were used to evaluate assay cross-reactivity. The overall sensitivity and specificity of all 6 assays were deemed sufficient for diagnostic use. However, sputum specimens were shown to be particularly PCR inhibition prone, negatively impacting assay sensitivity, and highlighted the importance of optimizing pretreatment and RNA extraction procedures when using this specimen type. In comparison, PCR inhibition was not observed in the NPOP specimens used in the present study, and minimal variations were observed in the internal control C T values. Nevertheless, the C T values for the LightMix assay reported from sputum specimens (Kim et al., 2016) were comparable with those of our URT specimens.",
