Understanding the origins of SARS-CoV-2 is critical for deterring future zoonosis and for drug discovery and vaccine development. We show evidence of strong purifying selection around the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the spike gene and in other genes among bat, pangolin and human coronaviruses, indicating similar strong evolutionary constraints in different host species. We also demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2's entire RBM was introduced through recombination with coronaviruses from pangolins, possibly a critical step in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2's ability to infect humans. Similar purifying selection in different host species and frequent recombination among coronaviruses suggest a common evolutionary mechanism that could lead to new emerging human coronaviruses.",

S1). It is followed by Pan_SL-CoV_GD viruses next, and then Pan_SL-CoV_GX. Among the bat-CoV sequences in clade 2 ( fig. S1 ), ZXC21 and ZC45, sampled from bats in 2005 in Zhoushan, Zhejiang, China, are the most divergent, with the exception of the beginning of the ORF1a gene (region 1, fig. 1A ). All other Bat_SL-CoV and SARS-CoV sequences form a separate clade 3, while clade 1 comprises BtKY72 and BM48-31, the two most divergent Bat_SL-CoV sequences, in the Sarbecovirus group ( fig. S1 ). Recombination in the first SARS-CoV-2 sequence (Wuhan-Hu-1) with other divergent CoVs has been previously observed (3) . Here, to better understand the role of recombination in the origin of SARS-CoV-2 among these genetically similar CoVs, we compare Wuhan-Hu-1 to six representative Bat_SL-CoVs, one SARS-CoV, and the two Pan_SL-CoV_GD sequences using SimPlot analysis (14) . RaTG13 has the highest similarity across the genome (8) , with two notable exceptions where a switch occurs ( fig. 1A ). In phylogenetic reconstructions, SARS-CoV-2 clusters closer to ZXC21 and ZC45 than RaTG13 at the beginning of the ORF1a gene (region 1, fig. 1B) , and, as reported (10, 15) , to a Pan_SL-CoV_GD in region 2 (fig.s 1C and S2), which spans the receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) binding site in the spike (S) glycoprotein gene. Comparing Wuhan-Hu-1 to Pan_SL-CoV_GD and RaTG13, as representative of distinct host-species branches in the evolutionary history of SARS-CoV-2, using the recombination detection tool RIP (16) , we find significant recombination breakpoints before and after the ACE2 binding site ( fig. S2A ), suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 carries a history of cross-species recombination between the bat and the pangolin CoVs.",

Within-region phylogenetic reconstructions show that Pan_SL-CoV sequences become as divergent as BtKY72 and BM48-31 in region 3 ( fig. 1D ), while less divergent in region 4, where Pan_SL-CoV_GD clusters with ZXC21 and ZC45 (fig .  1E ). Together, these observations suggest ancestral cross-species recombination between pangolin and bat CoVs in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 at the ORF1a and S genes. Furthermore the discordant phylogenetic clustering at various regions of the genome among clade 2 CoVs also supports extensive recombination among these viruses isolated from bats and pangolins.",

Specifically, amino acid sequences of the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the C terminal of the S1 subunit are nearly identical to those in two Pan_SL-CoV_GD viruses, with only one amino acid difference (Q498H)-although the RBM region has not been fully sequenced in one of Guangdong pangolin virus (Pan_SL-CoV_GD/P2S) ( fig. 2A ). Pangolin CoVs from Guangxi are much more divergent. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of this region shows three distinct clusters of SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 and bat-CoV only viruses, respectively ( fig. 2B ).

However, structures of the S1 unit of the S protein from both viruses are highly similar (21) (22) (23) , with the exception of a loop, not proximal to the binding site, that bends differently ( fig. 2C ). This suggests that viral entry through binding of ACE2 is structurally constrained to maintain the correct conformation. Among 17 distinct amino acids between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 ( fig. 2A ), five contact sites are different, likely impacting RaTG13's binding to ACE2 ( fig. 2D and Table S1 ). The single amino acid difference (Q or H at position 498) between SARS-CoV-2 and Pan_SL-CoV_GD is at the edge of the ACE2 contact interface; neither Q or H at this position form hydrogen bonds with ACE2 residues ( fig. 2E ). Thus, a functional RBM nearly identical to the one in SARS-CoV-2 is naturally present in Pan_SL-CoV_GD viruses. The very distinctive RaTG13 RBM suggests that this virus is unlikely to infect human cells, and that the acquisition of a complete functional RBM by a RaTG13-like CoV through a recombination event with a Pan_SL-CoV_GD-like virus enabled it to use ACE2 for human infection.",

The RaTG13 sequence was sampled in 2013, years before SARS-CoV-2 was first identified. It is unlikely that both SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 independently acquired identical insertions at three different locations in the S gene. Thus, it is plausible that an RaTG13-like virus served as a progenitor to generate SARS-CoV-2 by gaining a complete human ACE2 binding RBM from Pan_SL-CoV_GD-like viruses through recombination. Genetic divergence at the nucleic acid level between Wuhan-Hu-1 and Pan_SL-CoV_GD viruses is significantly reduced from 13.9% ( fig. 1E ) to 1.4% at the amino acid level ( fig. 2B ) in the RBM region, indicating recombination between RaTG13-like CoVs and Pan_SL-CoV_GD-like CoVs. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 has a unique furin cleavage site insertion (PRRA) not found in any other CoVs in the Sarbecovirus group (24), although similar motifs are also found in MERS and more divergent bat CoVs (25) (Fig. S3 ). This PRRA motif makes the S1/S2 cleavage in SARS-CoV-2 much more efficiently than in SARS-CoV and may expand its tropism and/or enhance its transmissibility (23) . A recent study of bat CoVs in Yunnan, China, identified a three-amino acid insertion (PAA) at the same site (26) . Although it is not known if this PAA motif can function like the PRRA motif, the presence of a similar insertion at the same site indicates that such insertion may already be present in the wild bat CoVs. The more efficient cleavage of S1 and S2 units of the spike glycoprotein (25) and efficient binding to ACE2 by SARS-CoV-2 (22, 27) may have allowed SARS-CoV-2 to jump to humans, leading to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 in China and the rest of the world.",

The much lower w value at the 3'-end of the S gene among the SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and Pan_SL-CoV viruses indicates that this region is under strong purifying selection within these sequences ( fig. 3A) . A plot of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions relative to Wuhan-Hu-1 highlights the regional differences across the region before and after the RBM and the furin cleavage site ( We observe similar patterns of purifying selection pressure in other parts of the genome, including the E and M genes, as well as the partial ORF1a and ORF1b genes ( fig. 4) . Interestingly, the purifying selection pressure varies among different viruses depending on which genes are analyzed. The broadest group includes SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, all Pan_SL-CoV and the two bat CoVs (ZXC21 and ZC45) for both E and M genes (figs. 4 and S5). The second group includes SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and all Pan_SL-CoV only for the 3' end of the S gene. The narrowest selection group only contains SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and pangolin CoVs from Guangdong for the partial regions of ORF1a and ORF1b (figs. 4 and S6). Consistently low \u03c9 values and strong purifying selection pressure on SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and Pan_SL-CoV_GD viruses suggest that these complete and partial genes are under similar functional/structural constraints among the different host species. In two extreme cases, amino acid sequences of the E gene and the 3' end of ORF1a are identical among the compared CoV sequences, although genetic distances are quite large among these viruses at the nucleic acid level. Such evolutionary constraints across viral genomes, especially at functional domains in the S gene, which plays an important role in cross-species transmission (5, 17) , coupled with frequent recombination, may facilitate cross-species transmissions between RaTG13-like bat and/or Pan_SL-CoV_GD-like viruses.",

To further explore the recombinant nature of SARS-CoVs, we compared GZ02 to representative bat CoV sequences using the RIP recombination detection tool (16) . We identified four significant breakpoints (at 99% confidence) between the two parental lineages ( fig. S8A ), further supported by phylogenetic analysis ( fig. S8B-S8D ). In addition, the two aforementioned groups of bat CoVs (shown in light brown and light blue in the trees) show similar cluster changes across the five recombinant regions, suggesting multiple events of historic recombination among bat SL-CoVs. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV shares a recombinant history with at least three different groups of bat-CoVs and confirms the major role of recombination in the evolution of these viruses.",

Group B bat SL-CoVs do not infect human cells (5, 19) and have two deletions in the RBM (figs. 1E and 2A). The short deletion between residues 445 and 449, and in particular the loss of Y449, which forms three hydrogen bonds with ACE2, will significantly affect the overall structure of the RBM (figs. 2F and 2E). The region encompassing the large deletion between residues 473 and 486 contains the loop structure that accounts for the major differences between the S protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 ( fig. 2C ). This deletion causes the loss of contact site F486 and affects the conserved residue F498's hydrophobic interaction with residue M82 on ACE2 (fig. 2F ). These two deletions will render RBM in those CoVs incapable to bind human ACE2. Therefore, recombination may play a role in enabling cross-species transmission in SARS-CoVs through the acquisition of an S gene type that can efficiently bind to the human ACE2 receptor.",

S9) , where nucleic acid sequences are nearly identical among both SARS-CoVs and group B bat CoVs. Moreover, all compared viruses form three highly distinct clusters ( fig. 5D ), suggesting that the ORF8 gene may be biologically constrained and evolves through modular recombination. The third recombination region at the beginning of ORF1a is where SARS-CoV-2 also recombined with other bat CoVs (region 1, fig. 1A ). This region is highly variable (5, 17) and recombination within this part of the genome was also found in many other CoVs, suggesting that it may be a recombination hotspot and may factor into cross-species transmission.",

SARS-CoV-2 has a nearly identical RBM to the one found in the pangolin CoVs from Guangdong. Thus, it is plausible that RaTG13-like bat-CoV viruses may have obtained the RBM sequence binding to human ACE2 through recombination with Pan_SL-CoV_GD-like viruses.

However, if the new SARS-CoV-2 strain did not cause widespread infections in its natural or intermediate hosts, such a strain may never be identified. The close proximity of animals of different species in a wet market setting may increase the potential for cross-species spillover infections, by enabling recombination between more distant coronaviruses and the emergence of recombinants with novel phenotypes. While the direct reservoir of SARS-CoV-2 is still being sought, one thing is clear: reducing or eliminating direct human contact with wild animals is critical to preventing new coronavirus zoonosis in the future.",

To investigate the impact of the deletion between residue 473 to 486 to the binding interface between SARS-CoV-2 and human ACE2, a homology model with the deletion was generated using I-TASSER (45) . The top five best models provided by the server have Confidence Score (C-score) of 0.86, -2.33, -4.01, -4.17, and -4.49. The C-score was used to estimate the quality of the models, which should be between -5.0 to 2; the higher the value, the higher the confidence in the model (45) . Based on the C-score, model 1 was used in Figure 2F . The interaction of the RBD of RaTG13 and ACE2 was modeled on PDB 6VW1, a hybrid structure of human SARS-CoV2 (46) using ICM software package (35) , and the mutational differences of the Gibbs free energy (Table S1) were calculated with the built-in algorithm. author/funder.
