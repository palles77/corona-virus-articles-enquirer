To study the pathogenic features of PEDV using a mouse model, PEDV with virulence in mice is required. In pursuit of this, we adapted a tissue-culture-passed PEDV MK strain to suckling mouse brains. PEDV obtained after ten passages through the brains (MK-p10) had increased virulence for mice, and its fusion activity in cultured cells exceeded that of the original strain. However, the replication kinetics of MK and MK-p10 did not differ from each other in the brain and in cultured cells. The spike (S) protein of MK-p10 had four amino acid substitutions relative to the original strain. One of these (an H-to-R substitution at residue 1,381) was first detected in PEDV isolated after eight passages, and both this virus (MK-p8) and MK-p10 showed enhanced syncytium formation relative to the original MK strain and viruses isolated after two, four, and six passages, suggesting the possibility that the H-to-R mutation was responsible for this activity. This mutation could be also involved in the increased virulence of PEDV observed for MK-p10.",

The mice were also weighed daily ( Fig. 2b; n = 12 ). The weights of the mice infected with MK or MK-p10 increased for 3-4 days after infection. Subsequently, the weight of the mice decreased beginning 4 days p.i., whereas the mice infected with MK began to lose weight 8 days p.i.-4 days later than the MK-p10infected mice. The body weight of the mice infected with MK-p10 was determined 7 days p.i. because most of the mice had succumbed by 7-11 days p.i. The mock-infected mice did not exhibit weight loss or clinical symptoms. As described above, a mouse-adapted variant of PEDV was successfully isolated.",

Some coronaviruses tend to remain intracellular, and viral stocks are prepared by ultrasonication or repeated freeze-thawing cycles. To compare the amounts of budded and intracellular virus, the titers in the supernatant (Fig. 3b) and cells (Fig. 3c) were determined separately. Similar to the growth kinetics in the brains of the mice, the growth pattern in Vero cells did not differ significantly between MK and MK-p10 (Fig. 3b, c) . These results suggest that the increased virulence in suckling mice and syncytium formation in cultured cells is not due to increased growth in the brain or cultured cells.",

The amino acid change at position 1,381 occurred at the eighth passage. As described above, the plaque size of MK-p10 was larger than that of the parental strain (Fig. 1) . This larger plaque morphology was also detected in PEDV after eight passages, whereas the viruses isolated after four and six passages showed syncytium formation similar to that in MK (Fig. 4) . These results suggest that the amino acid change at position 1,381 (H to R) first detected at the eighth passage, which is located in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) region, contributed to the larger plaques of MK-p10, though other genes must be considered.",

            "text": "Two different coronaviruses, OC43 and IBV, have successfully adapted to grow in mice and show virulence after brain-to-brain passage in suckling mice [3, 12] . These viruses initially showed low virulence (i.e., clinical symptoms such as tremor and rigidity and lethargy in suckling mice), but the virulence increased with repeated passage in mouse brains. In this study, the passage of PEDV in suckling mouse brains clearly strengthened its virulence, similar to the adaptation seen in OC43 and IBV. Unexpectedly, the original mouse non-adapted PEDV showed significant virulence for suckling mice. The primary sequences of S protein from the viruses isolated after repeated passages were determined. PEDV passed in mouse brains showed mutations in the S protein, which had accumulated after ten passages. The H-to-R mutation at residue 1,381, which was first detected after eight passages, is likely responsible for the enhanced cell-cell fusion activity, as only those viruses with this mutation showed significantly larger syncytia compared with the original PEDV; The S protein is a major determinant of the fusion activity of coronaviruses [5, 20] . It would be interesting to find out whether this substitution in the S protein is responsible for the enhanced fusion activity by expressing S protein alone. Those mutations found in the mouseadapted viral S proteins could be responsible for the increased virulence; however, other genes have been reported to be involved in the virulence of such coronaviruses as MHV and SARS-CoV [7, 15, 17, 21] . To identify the genes responsible for the increase in virulence, we would need the entire genomic sequences of the original and mouse-adapted PDEVs; additionally, reverse-genetic analyses would be essential. PEDV differs from most coronaviruses in that it grows in cultures of cells derived from animal species not susceptible to PEDV; the virus grows efficiently in Vero cells derived from the kidneys of green monkey, which is not a natural host of the virus [8] . Few cases are known in which coronaviruses multiply in cells derived from non-susceptible host animals. SARS-CoV can grow in a variety of cells established from several animal species [13, 14, 18, 24] , and it is somewhat capable of growing in the same animals; however, efficient infection is restricted to cells from animals that support SARS-CoV infection [24] . The growth potential of SARS-CoV in a variety of animal cells correlated with the utilization of its receptor molecule, ACE2 [11] . Most known coronaviruses become infective in cells when their functional receptor molecule is expressed by transfection with a plasmid encoding the receptor molecule [5] . This suggests that Vero cells susceptible to PEDV infection express a functional receptor. In our study, both mouse-adapted and non-adapted MK strains of PEDV could infect and grow in suckling mouse brains, suggesting that a receptor molecule utilized by both viruses exists in suckling mouse brain. To determine which cell types in the brain express the receptor, we are attempting to identify the cell types that are infected by PEDV in suckling mouse brain. This will provide valuable information related to the receptor molecule utilized by PEDV.",
