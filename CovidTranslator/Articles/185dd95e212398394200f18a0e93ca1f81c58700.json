The detection of BDV in diseased animals, mainly sheep and horses, is achieved by histological, immunohistochemical and serological approaches and/or PCR-based technologies. In the present study, reverse transcription, real-time PCR assays were established for the detection of BDV in the brain tissue from sheep and horses, using loci for the p40 (nucleoprotein) and the p24 (phosphoprotein) genes. The PCRs were equally specific and sensitive, detecting 10 target molecules per reaction and one BDV-infected cell among 10 6 non-infected cells. In tissues from BDV-diseased sheep and horses, the p24 target was detected at higher abundance than for p40. Therefore, the p24 test is suggested to be of higher value in the diagnostic laboratory. However, both assays should be useful for addressing questions in pathogenesis and for detecting BDV reservoirs in endemic areas. r",

Replication and transcription of the BDV genome occur in the cell nucleus. The genome size is 8.9 kb, which makes it the smallest of all known negative-stranded RNA viruses [19, 20] . The organization of the six open reading frames (ORFs) is similar to that of other Mononegaviruses [20] . Based on their positions in the viral genome (3 0 -N-X-P-M-G-L-5 0 ) and the features of the corresponding amino acid sequences, these polypeptides are counterparts of the nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix protein (M), surface glycoprotein (G) and polymerase (L), respectively, which are also found in other negative-stranded RNA viruses [21] . Negative-stranded RNA viruses initiate infection by introducing their genetic material in the form of ribonucleoprotein complexes into host cells. These complexes, which consist of the singlestranded RNA genome associated with the RNA-binding protein N, the polymerase cofactor P and the RNAdependent RNA polymerase L, are transcriptionally active and direct the synthesis of viral mRNAs [22] . Both the composition and stoichiometry of the nucleocapsid N and P are involved in the regulation of the BDV multiplication cycle [23] [24] [25] .",

            "text": "Intra vitam diagnosis of Borna disease (BD) is difficult. Sheep and horses with BD exhibit a range of signs [26] . For instance, increased protein content and mononuclear pleocytosis may be seen in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) due to meningoencephalitis. However, these findings are not specific for BD, rather represent non-specific indicators for viral meningoencephalitis [26] . BDV-specific antibodies in serum and or CSF are considered useful indicators, but post-mortem confirmation by histological and immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissues is required. Histologically, variable degrees of encephalitis are observed with BD [27] [28] [29] , characterized by disseminated mononuclear polioencephalomyelitis, with subsequent neuronal degeneration and meningitis. Usually, areas of the limbic system, particularly the hippocampal formation, are involved, whereas the brain stem and cerebellum remain relatively unaffected [28] . Immunohistochemical analyses of paraffinembedded brain sections using monoclonal antibodies to the major BDV antigens P38/40 (N) and P24 (P) have shown consistently that virus-infected cells are not uniformly distributed in brains from diseased animals and that antigen-positive neurons are detected most frequently in the hippocampus [3, 27, 28] .",

Serological assays, such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [30] , and molecular methods based on nucleic acid hybridization [31] or on the PCR have been evaluated for the detection of viral transcripts [2, 26, [30] [31] [32] [33] . For example, highly sensitive conventional PCR assays have been developed for the detection of BDV in unfixed or formalin-fixed brain tissue [2, 32, 33] . While presently these PCRs are useful, they have the disadvantage that it is a 'nested' assay [33] and, for routine application, is thus prone to cross-contamination problems during the conduct of the procedure. Therefore, laboratory diagnosis, relying exclusively on RT-nested PCR results should be evaluated and appraised with caution [5] . To overcome this limitation, the present study established a rapid and effective reverse-transcription, real-time PCR for the detection and quantification of the nucleoprotein (P38/40) and the phosphoprotein (P24) transcripts of BDV in brain tissue samples from sheep and horses with BD. Furthermore, highly sensitive and specific BDV-assays are important for the detection of inapparently infected animals and epidemiological studies regarding possible vectors.",

In two independent series of experiments, BDV was detected by the novel RT-PCR methods down to the dilution of 1:256-1:1024, which corresponded to 1.5-0.4 FFU.

As discussed below, this was not the case when tissues from Borna-diseased patients were analyzed. BDV was readily detectable by the novel PCR tests in brain samples from animals with BD. The brain sites cortex and hippocampal formation were chosen according to the predilection sites of BDV in the brain. As expected, the relative virus loads in cortex and hippocampus were higher than in the cerebellum, which is usually also less affected by the infection [28, 29, 41, 42] . Interestingly, the relative virus load in lobus piriformis was similar to that of the hippocampal formation. The data obtained by the PCR correlated, on a qualitative level, with the immunohistochemical findings of higher virus load in cortex and hippocampus compared to the cerebellum [28, 29, 41, 42] . However, since different dilutions of the monoclonal antibodies had to be used for optimal immune staining, the viral protein loads (P38/40 and P24) could not be directly compared between signals arising from the anti-P24 monoclonal antibody or the anti-P38/40 monoclonal antibody, respectively. However, comparison between signals from the same tool in different locations in the brain was possible. Immunohistology gives a representation about the local distribution of infected cells in the present section, whereas our newly established methods give the average of template copies in a specific sample relative to the amount of cells used for extraction. Finally, the variation in stability of BDV antigens and RNA in formaldehyde fixed or frozen tissue has to be considered as an unreliable factor. For these reasons, consistent quantitative correlations between immunohistology and quantitative RT-PCR could not be expected. Antibodies against P24 and P38/40 of BDV can be detected in the sera from infected animals [43] . In addition, the corresponding antigens are the main products in BDVinfected cell cultures and can be detected in brain samples from BDV-infected animals not only by immunohistochemistry, but also Western blot [44, 45] . According to the literature, the ratio between P38/40 and P24 changes in the course of infection, in as much as acutely infected cells show a higher level of P38/40 antigen, whereas persistently infected cells show higher levels of P24 [23] [24] [25] 30] .",

While varying BDV RNA loads were detected in individuals and in different brain areas, the loads associated with p24 were consistently greater than those linked to the p40 locus. A hallmark of the virus producing (productive) infection of cells with members of the Mononegavirales consists of the formation of a gradient of mRNAs with synthesis of the highest copy number of mRNA at the 3 0 -end of the negative sense genomic RNA, followed by increasingly attenuated mRNA synthesis towards the other end of the genome [46] . It had been expected that, similar to infected cell cultures, an equal or even greater number of p40 targets would be present in productively infected cells of patient tissue. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that BDV replication is optimal when P38/40 antigen was in a 30-fold excess compared with P24 [23] [24] [25] .",

A technical explanation may be that p24 targets were reverse transcribed at greater efficiency than p40 targets, although, due to the opposing observation in cell culture extracts, it seems more plausible that more p24 than p40 targets were present in those samples. Indeed, we did not use in vitro transcribed RNA to compare the efficiency of individual cDNA synthesis in our system. However, Watanabe and others made the same observation in BDV-infected neonatal gerbils [47] . Interestingly, both the p24 mRNA and the P24 protein were more abundant than their p40 and P38/40 counterparts in diseased gerbils as opposed to healthy gerbils infected with the same dose of BDV. Together, these two independent observations suggest that the amount of p24 mRNA could be used as a marker for the progression of disease and that the gerbil model reflects the situation in the natural host. Diagnostically, these observations suggest that detection of the p24 target is the more sensitive tool for routine applications with patient materials.",

The primers detected BDV transcripts with high specificity and the approach also proved to be highly sensitive. In addition, the PCRs also allowed the relative quantification of virus loads from different sites in horse and sheep brain. These data were in good agreement with previous immunohistochemical studies using the same samples. The results described here and the high specificity and sensitivity of the PCRs established herein indicate that this approach will not only be a valuable diagnostic tool but may also be useful for studies of the epidemiology, ecology and pathogenesis of BDV. Fig. 3 . Relative amounts of BDV templates in various brain regions of BDV-diseased horses. Extracts from triplicate samples of cortex and hippocampus of three different BDV-diseased horses (S00-0913, S99-0598 and S96-0868) as well as lobus piriformis from two horses and cerebellum from one horse were subjected to reverse transcription and real-time PCR. Box plots are shown, representing maximal, average, median, and minimal numbers of BDV-specific template detected. The signals of the BDVspecific amplifications are expressed as arbitrary units (y-axis) relative to the 18S rRNA signal, which normalizes the total number of cells in the assay. Amplifications for p40 and p24 were done simultaneously, using the same volume of the same template. The threshold for both primers was 0.0004. x-axis: brain sites and PCR system; y-axis: relative BDV copy number. cells, Ph.

Box plots are shown, representing maximal, average, median, and minimal numbers of BDV-specific template detected. The signals of the BDV-specific amplifications are expressed as arbitrary units (y-axis) relative to the 18S rRNA signal, which normalizes the total number of cells in the assay. Amplifications for p40 and p24 were done simultaneously, using the same volume of the same template. The threshold for both primers was 0.005. xaxis: brain sites and PCR system; y-axis: relative BDV copy number.",

The threshold for both primers was 0.00004 (dashed line), representing the normalized and calibrated value from non-infected MDCK cells (see materials and methods). White bars: amplification with p40 primers; gray bars: with p24 primers; x-axis: number of infected MDCK cells; y-axis: relative BDV copy number.",
