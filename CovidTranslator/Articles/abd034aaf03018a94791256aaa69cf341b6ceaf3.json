For example, nurses are exposed to blood-borne pathogens, chemicals used for sterilizing instruments, caustic chemotherapeutic agents, residual anesthesia gases, needlestick injuries, and even muscular strains and stressors (United States Department of Labor, 2010). Nonphysical risk also occurs and may include psychological burden and emotional distress. Indeed, health care is s risky business; more than 600,000 injuries and illness cases were reported among health care and social assistant workers in 2010 (United States Department of Labor, 2010). Caring for patients with certain health conditions, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, other multidrugresistant organisms, HIV, and now Ebola, has at times raised nurses' concern about balancing possible risk to themselves with their responsibility for taking care of patients. Nurses and other health care providers have a moral and professional obligation to care for patients even in the face of difficult circumstances and some risk to themselves, but this obligation is not absolute. Risk to the nurse can be a justification for not providing particular kinds of care in certain circumstances and can outweigh the nurse's obligations to provide care. In the face of possible serious or life-threatening risks to the nurse, careful analysis of these risks in light of possible benefits to the patient is crucial.",

Essential treatment for Ebola is supportive care, especially the provision of replacement fluids and electrolytes; to date, there are no known effective antiviral agents for Ebola. Clinical reports show that better supportive care improves patients' chances of survival (Briand et al., 2014; Chertow et al., 2014; Fowler et al., 2014) . Furthermore, the risk of health care providers acquiring Ebola from patients in their care appears to vary by setting (Belluz, 2014) . Sufficient staffing coupled with essential supplies, proper use of personal protective equipment, and adequate training and support make the risk to nurses of acquiring Ebola from patients appear to be low (Boozary, Farmer, & Jha, 2014) .",

The inevitable delay caused by suiting up coupled with the \"uncontrolled and chaotic\" risk of exposure to blood and secretions from emergent intubation, line placement, chest compressions, and other procedures involved in a code affect both CPR's value and the risks (Fins, 2014) .",

These are complicated and ethical decisions and, like many other challenging treatment and care decisions, are part of the daily lives of nurses who care for seriously ill patients and their families. Many factors are considered in decisions about the utility and benefits of CPR in different patient populations with a variety of illnesses and in various settings (Mercurio, Murray, & Gross, 2014) . Indeed, conflict can arise when there are divergent preferences and goals or disagreements about the justifications for initiating or withdrawing aggressive care, including intubation, dialysis, and CPR. In many ways, decisions regarding the care of a patient diagnosed with Ebola are no different, but in other ways they may be.",

In Ebola, important factors to consider include the severity of illness and prognosis of the patient; the likely benefit of CPR for the patient; patient, and family preferences; preparedness of nurses and others on the health care team; and resources available in the setting. The potential for benefit to the patient from CPR can vary. Certain Ebola patients with multiorgan failure, septic shock, and significant hemorrhaging may indeed be unlikely to benefit from CPR, whereas others perhaps experiencing an arrhythmia from severe hypokalemia clearly could benefit from resuscitation and with related intensive and appropriate care have a good chance of achieving a full recovery. The potential risk to health care personnel also can vary. In some settings, such as in a hospital isolation unit, a nurse in full personal protective equipment may already be present with the patient and able to begin resuscitation efforts without delay and without exceptional risk to him-or herself. In other settings, it may indeed be so chaotic or the health care providers insufficiently prepared or lacking the resources to handle it safely that not attempting CPR would be appropriate.",

Especially important is consideration of the kinds of circumstances under which the risk of offering CPR or other invasive procedures when caring for Ebola patients might be unacceptably high for health care clinicians and how these decisions will be made.
