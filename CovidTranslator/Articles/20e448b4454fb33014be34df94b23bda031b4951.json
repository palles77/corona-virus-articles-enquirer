Since many tourism products such as airline seats and hotel rooms are perishable, efficient planning based on accurate estimation of demand is critical for successful tourism businesses. An inability to meet demand often leads to business failure in the tourism industry (Song & Witt, 2006) . For the public sector, tourism forecasting provides a basis for planning investments in tourism infrastructure such as airports and highways (Lee, Song, & Mjelde, 2008) . Since such large-scale infrastructure projects require considerable public funds over the long term, the expected return on investment (ROI) should be spelled out in the planning stages, and ROI is in large part determined by forecasting tourism demand. Accordingly, accurate demand estimation is essential when appraising investment plans' economic feasibility (Song & Witt, 2006) .",

However, results regarding the effects of price variables (e.g.relative prices, exchange rates, transport cost) on international tourism demand vary widely. Some inconsistent results may be attributable to use of different variables as a proxy for the same tourism price factor. This inconsistent use of price variables suggests that more research needs to be done to identify the price variables that best represent international tourism price.",

Moreover, recent changes in economic circumstances such as currency depreciation resulting from unconventional monetary policy (US, Eurozone, Japan), shifts in exchange rate policy (Switzerland, Singapore, China), and drastic drops in oil prices triggered by expanded supplies of shale gas may substantially influence the cost of travel to the countries changing international tourism demand.

In this approach, demand forecasting is performed by analyzing the patterns of past demand movements and then, from that, predicting future movements (Song & Li, 2008) .

The relationship may be sensitive to changes in domestic tourism prices in the origin country and therefore many demand models include prices of destination tourism products relative to the origin country in order to consider the cross-price effect (Loeb, 1982; Tan, McCahon, & Miller, 2002) . Because price information of tourism goods and services is generally unavailable, consumer price index (CPI) has commonly been used as a proxy for relative prices (Akis, 1998; Lee, 1996; Morley, 1994; Muchpondwa & Pumhidzai, 2011) . Furthermore, actual prices of a destination's tourism products have not been found to be clearly superior to CPI in accounting for tourism demand (Martin & Witt, 1988) . Although CPI is most commonly used for relative prices (Akis, 1998) , Gil-Pareja et al. (2007) included purchasing power parity in their demand model instead of CPI and Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz (2006) developed her own tourism price index.",

For example, Webber (2001) identified the determinants of tourism demand for Australia in eight tourism markets using Engle and Granger's procedure and Johansen's procedure. The results showed that relative prices had a significantly negative effect on tourist arrivals from six of the eight countries, all but Malaysia and the U.K. Hiemstra and Wong (2002) investigated the outbound tourism from seven major countries to Hong Kong between 1990 and 1998. In the study, autoregressive estimation was employed for seven tourism demand models and relative prices were included only in the demand model for Australia-Hong Kong. The results of the study provided clear evidence of a significant effect of relative prices on tourist arrivals from Australia to Hong Kong. On the other hand, Muchpondwa and Pimhidzai (2011) found no link between relative prices and tourism demand. Lee et al.

When the currency of a country devalues, its tourism becomes more price competitive and therefore travel demand for the country is likely to increase (De Vita & Kyaw, 2013) . Conversely, as the value of a country's currency rises, the decreased price competitiveness of its tourism results in a reduction in inbound tourism (De Vita, 2014) . However, this view has not always been borne out in international tourism markets. Some researchers (e.g. Di Matteo & Di Matteo, 1996; Eilat & Einav, 2004; Hiemstra & Wong, 2002; Rosell\u00f3-Villalonga, Aguil\u00f3-P\u00e9rez, & Riera, 2005; Wang, 2009 ) have found evidence that exchange rates have a significant effect on tourism demand, while others (e.g. Hui & Yuen, 1998; Muchapondwa & Pimhidzai, 2011; Webber, 2001) failed to find such evidence. In addition, Lee (1996) developed several demand models for inbound tourism to Korea and the results of exchange rate were inconsistent. These results indicate that the effects of exchange rates are asymmetric across countries and even across different markets in a single country.",

According to Song and Witt (2000) , price changes in a destination country can be calibrated by movements in exchange rate. Therefore, the destination price level that potential foreign tourists pay attention to is relative prices adjusted by exchange rates. Based on this argument, many researchers (e.g. Chang, Khamkaew, & McAleer, 2010; Divisekera, 2003; Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz, 2006; Kliman, 1981) convert relative prices into the currency of an origin country in tourism demand equations. Numerous studies (e.g. De Vita, 2014; Divisekera, 2003; Durbarry & Sinclair, 2003; Hiemstra & Wong, 2002) have argued for the significance of effective relative prices. Tan et al. (2002) concluded that effective relative prices were a better measure of living costs for Malaysian and Indonesian tourism. In contrast, Eilat and Einav (2004) and O'Hagan and Harrison (1984) argue that relative prices and exchange rates should enter separately into tourism demand models because it is highly likely that tourists will have more up-to-date information on exchange rates than on relative prices. Accordingly, they are more likely to use exchange rates to estimate cost of travel to the destination. Moreover, it has been noted that responsiveness of tourists to exchange rates is distinctive from their responsiveness to changes in relative prices (Gray, 1966; Lee, 1996; Muchapondwa & Pimhidzai, 2011) . With this in mind, many researchers (e.g. De Vita & Kyaw, 2013; Di Matteo & Di Matteo, 1996; Eilat & Einav, 2004; Edward, 1995; Wang, 2009 ) have included exchange rates as a separate variable in their tourism demand equations.",

For example, Wang (2009) employed the autoregressive distributed lag model to identify the determinants of Taiwan's inbound tourism, particularly focusing on the effect of disastrous events. The study reported that oil prices had a significantly negative effect on Taiwan tourism indicating that foreign tourists are less likely to visit Taiwan as transport cost rises. De Vita (2014) used a distance variable to approximate transport cost through a gravity-type tourism demand equation and found distance was significant on tourism demand for 27 countries. The popular use of gravity models in tourism demand studies has allowed extensive investigation of the explanatory power of distance. Such studies include Eryi\u011fit, Kotil and Eryi\u011fit (2010) , Park and Jang (2014) , and Uysal and Crompton (1984) . However, oil prices and distance may be inappropriate for representing transport costs since neither variable considers the other, but both are main elements of the fuel cost function. Airfares are also limited due to complex fare structures and lack of data availability (Song & Witt, 2000; Webber, 2001) .",

The major presence of Korea in Japanese tourism may be a result of the strong ties established in the various areas (Lee, Song, & Bendle, 2010) . Moreover, due to geographic proximity and the strong ties between the two countries, Koreans are likely to be aware of Japanese economic conditions and thus reasonably responsive to changes in Japanese tourism price. Accordingly, the impact of the different price variables of Japan tourism, whether positive or negative, can be readily captured in relation to Korea.",

Relative price (RPRC t ) was calculated as the ratio of Japanese CPI to Korea CPI and exchange rate (EXC t ) was measured as the value of JPY per KRW. The second model added oil prices as a proxy for transport cost. Real oil price (ROIL t ) was computed by dividing crude oil prices per gallon by Korean CPI. The third model used jet-fuel prices as a proxy for transport cost instead of oil prices. Despite the importance of distance in transport cost functions, oil price variable does not reflect the distance between two countries. In addition, crude oil may have different price movement from the jet fuel actually used by aircraft. Thus, this study developed a variable of jet-fuel prices as new proxy for transport cost, since it takes into account both distance and actual fuel price. Real jetfuel price (RJET t ) was calculated as (jet-fuel prices per gallon\u00d7(distance/average fuel efficiency per seat))/Korean CPI. In the fourth model, a combined variable, effective relative price (RPRC t ), was used to represent living cost. Effective relative price (ERPRC t ) was calculated by adjusting relative price (RPRC t ) with exchange rate (EXC t ). The fifth model added real oil price (ROIL t ) to the explanatory variables used in the fourth model.

While Pearson correlation analysis was performed for continuous variables, the pointbiserial correlation method was applied to the pairs of continuous and binary variables. Phi correlation was used when both variables had binary values. Point-biserial correlation and phi correlation are equivalent to Pearson correlation (Gould & Rogers, 1992; Revelle, 2008) . The results showed that none of the explanatory variables were highly correlated indicating that the estimated models did not have multicollinearity problems which can reduce the overall data fit of a model and increase the variance of coefficients, decreasing the model's statistical power (Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson, 2010) . Table 2 summarizes the results of model estimation. The results showed that all six models explained more than 70% of the variance in Korean tourist arrivals to Japan. In terms of R 2 , Models 1, 2, and 3 which treated relative price (RPRC t ) and exchange rate (EXC t ) separately appeared to provide a better fit to the data than Models 4, 5, and 6 which used effective relative price (ERPRC t ).

Considering this, it is notable that exchange rates are an important consideration in destination selection even though Koreans may be well aware of the prices of Japanese tourism products due to the two countries' proximity and sustained active relationship.

Thus, this study's significant contribution is to extend existing tourism demand literature by empirically identifying two price variables used for tourism destination choice in the Korea-to-Japan context. In the identified model, per capita income was significant on Japanese tourism demand from Korea. This result is consistent with previous studies (e.g. Gar\u00edn-Mu\u00f1oz, 2006; Lee, 1996; Webber, 2001) which found this variable to be an important determinant of tourism demand. Two separate price variables were also significant determinants. The significant results for relative prices, exchange rates, and per capita income support the application of the classic demand theory to Japanese inbound tourism. The results also indicate that the demand for Japan tourism by Koreans can be effectively estimated without considering transport cost. This implies that changes in transport cost do not affect Japanese inbound tourism from Korea. Two different measures of transport cost, oil price and jet-fuel price, were indeed found to be unrelated to changes in Japanese inbound tourism from Korea in the full models. The results suggest that tourists planning short-haul international travel are less likely to take into account the cost of transport to their destination. As a result, caution should be exercised in including transport cost in modeling the demand for shorthaul international travel.",

In other words, outbound tourism from Korea to Japan is sensitive to movements in the Korean economy. This suggests that economic growth in Korea generates a significant increase in the Korean demand for tourism to Japan. Although destination countries have limited ability to influence per capita income of inbound tourists, since it is mainly affected by economic conditions in origin countries, destination countries can still take advantage of this characteristic. For example, when Japanese inbound tourism from Korea shrinks due to a local or global recession, Japan's tourism industry could counter this loss by reallocating their promotional resources to tourism markets experiencing an economic boom or less economy-sensitive markets. To implement this strategy, Japan would need to monitor economic conditions in Korea and its other major tourism markets such as China, Taiwan, and the US.",

            "text": "As discussed earlier, relative prices and exchange rates had a significant effect on Japanese inbound tourism demand from Korea. Combined with the results for other explanatory variables in the most appropriate model, this shows that relative prices contribute the most to Japan's inbound tourism in terms of elasticity and indicates that prices of tourism products are the most important factor in the choice of destination by tourists. Given that prices of tourism products are manageable by destination country or tourism industry to a certain extent, and the importance of price in attracting international tourists to Japan, a solid pricing strategy is critical for the Japanese tourism industry to maintain destination competitiveness. Some researchers (e.g. Bowen, 1998; Griffin, Shea & Weaver, 1997; Papadopoulos, 1989) have emphasized the importance of the price competitiveness of Japanese tourism products with those of neighboring countries such as China and Korea, which provide relatively cheap tourism products. For price competitiveness, the relentless efforts of the private sector, including cost reduction, new technology adoption, and research and development, should be made on a continuous basis (Blake, Sinclair, & Soria, 2006; Dwyer & Kim, 2003) . In the same vein, government is of great importance in providing sustainable price-competitive tourism products. The recent jump in tourist arrivals to Japan, for example, was triggered by a sharp decline in the value of JPY resulting from Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe's economic policy known as 'Abenomics' (Ong, 2014) . This indicates that government economic policy is likely to influence tourism demand by altering economic conditions, which are responsible for the prices of tourism products (Edward, 1995; Eilat & Einav, 2004) . Furthermore, governments could offer tax credits for international tourists' expenditures (Dimanche, 2003) and tax incentives to tourism firms which undertake extensive overseas marketing campaigns, hold international meetings, and renovate or replace their facilities (Blake & Sinclair, 2003; McKehee & Kim, 2004) . Great care must therefore be taken in formulating tourism and economic policies in order to promote international tourism through price competitiveness and stability.",

            "text": "As with many other tourism demand studies, this study is not without limitations. First, the relatively small subject pair and sample observations may limit the generalizability of the results. Second, although none of the explanatory variables could be excluded due to multicollinearity, the variables may not be totally free from the multicollinearity problem given that significant correlations exist between the variables. One way to overcome the first limitation would be to use panel data. Examining the relationship between different price variables and tourism arrivals in the context of multiple tourism markets would improve the generalizability of the variable selection results. For the second limitation, it would be worthwhile employing dynamic factor analysis, a time-series extension of factor analysis proposed by Geweke (1977) . By applying factor analysis to multivariate time series data, dynamic factor analysis can address the correlation between explanatory variables and data stationarity (Stock & Watson, 2011) . Third, this study used primarily economic variables to explain Japanese inbound tourism from Korea. Over the course of their history, politically sensitive issues have arisen between Korean and Japan, such as the use of Korean 'comfort women' under Japanese colonial rule and the territorial dispute in the East Sea (Lee et al., 2010) . Korean public opinion (or sentiment) regarding these sensitive issues may affect Korean tourism to Japan. Future studies could consider this intangible aspect in modeling tourism demand between Korea and Japan. In addition, it would be interesting to test the effect of jet-fuel prices, our new proxy for transport cost, in different tourism destinations.",
