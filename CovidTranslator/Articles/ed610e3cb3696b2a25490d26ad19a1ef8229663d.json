            "text": "A hallmark of translation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is a -1 programmed ribosome frameshifting event that produces the Gag-Pol fusion polyprotein. The constant Gag to Gag-Pol ratio is essential for the virion structure and infectivity. Here we show that the frameshifting efficiency is modulated by Leu-tRNA Leu that reads the UUA codon at the mRNA slippery site. This tRNA Leu isoacceptor is particularly rare in human cell lines derived from T-lymphocytes, the cells that are targeted by HIV-1. When UUA decoding is delayed, the frameshifting follows an alternative route, which maintains the Gag to Gag-Pol ratio constant. A second potential slippery site downstream of the first one is normally inefficient but can also support -1-frameshifting when altered by a compensatory resistance mutation in response to current antiviral drug therapy. Together these different regimes allow the virus to maintain a constant -1-frameshifting efficiency to ensure successful virus propagation. Figure 1. -1FS on HIV-1 gag-pol mRNA. (A) Scheme of the gag-pol frameshifting site. Slippery site (SS1) and the putative second slippery site (pSS2) are highlighted in green; the stimulatory mRNA structure element downstream of the SS1 is indicated as a stem-loop (SL1). Amino acids incorporated into 0-frame and -1-frame peptides as well as the potential -1FS routes and in vivo efficiencies are shown below the frameshifting sites. (B) Top panel: Amino acids incorporated into 0-and -1-frames are shown above the mRNA sequence. Bottom panel: -1FS efficiency with the wild-type (wt) mRNA and U 4 C derivative with disrupted SS1 measured at limiting amounts of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu (molar ratio 0.3 tRNA to 70S ribosome) at the end of translation (2 min). The 0-frame is the sum of MQANF and MQANFLG peptides, -1-frame corresponds to MQANFFR/FLR peptides. MQANF was identified based on its position on the chromatogram while MQANFFR/FLR and MQANFLG products were quantified using [ 14 C]Arg and [ 3 H]Gly, respectively. (C) Concentration dependence of -1FS efficiency on the Leu-tRNA NAA Leu (tRNA NAA Leu , closed circles) or a mixture of tRNA Leu isoacceptors reading CUN codons (tRNA NAG Leu , open circles). -1FS product was detected using [ 14 C]Arg. (D) Change in the FS regime with the Leu-tRNA NAA Leu concentration. The ratio of FFR route (open circles) versus FLR (closed circles) route was calculated from peptides with different radioactive labels as follows. The sum of FFR and FLR frameshifting products was calculated using [ 14 C]Arg. To determine the amount of FLR, the mRNA was translated to the 0-frame peptide fMet-Gln-Asn-Phe-Leu-Gly-Lys-Ile (MQANFLGKI). The presence of Ile allows for separation between 0-frame MQANFLGKI and -1-frame MQANFLR peptides. The FFR peptide was then determined by subtracting the FLR from the total Arg-containing product. (E) -1FS efficiency in the presence of varying concentrations of Gly-tRNA Gly in the presence of excess Arg-tRNA Arg (2 M) (green squares) or with varying concentrations of Arg-tRNA Arg in the presence of 3 or 6 M Gly-tRNA Gly (red and light red squares, respectively).",

The two HIV-1 genes, gag and pol, encode viral structural proteins and enzymes, respectively, and overlap by 205 nt. Synthesis of the Gag-Pol polyprotein requires -1 ribosome frameshifting (-1FS) (5) . The ratio between Gag and Gag-Pol is crucial for virus propagation and its dysregulation is detrimental for replication, virion formation and infectivity of HIV-1 (6) (7) (8) (9) . The efficiency of gag-pol -1FS in human cells is about 10%, ranging from 2% to 11% with different reporters (10) (11) (12) (13) . This -1FS efficiency has been recapitulated in vivo or in vitro in mammalian, yeast or Escherichia coli translation extracts (5, 11, (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) (22) , suggesting that the virus exploits evolutionary conserved features of the translational apparatus.",

SS1 gives rise to two frameshifting products, one that contains the 0-frame peptide Phe-Leu followed by the -1-frame sequence (FLR product; Figure 1A and B), and another with a second Phe incorporated instead of Leu (FFR product). In mammalian cells \u223c30% of frameshifting ribosomes do not insert Leu, but are likely to insert Phe at the same position (5) . Also in E. coli, both products are produced, with the FLR constituting about 80% of the product (5, 15, 23, 24) . Further HIV frameshifting product heterogeneity may result from -2 frameshifting (25) . In addition, the gag-pol gene has a second, putative slippery site (pSS2) 38 nt downstream of the canonical SS1 (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . This slippery site is also conserved albeit to a lesser degree than the first slippery site (31) . The sequence of pSS2 (U 1 UUU 4 CUU 7 ) is not particularly slippery, but a substitution of C 5 with U (C 5 U), which appears as a compensatory resistance mutation during anti-HIV therapy, may facilitate additional FS at this otherwise silent site (26) (27) (28) 30) .",

The variety of proposed mechanisms of -1FS (23) , the uncertain significance of the second slippery site, and the lack of mechanistic information about alternative slippages (e.g., -2FS or +1FS) have prompted us to study gag-pol frameshifting in real time in a fully reconstituted in vitro translation system. We show that FS pathway and efficiency are determined by the availability of Leu-tRNA Leu reading the UUA codon. The potential alternative +1 and -2 slippages can also operate when other aminoacyl-tRNAs (aa-tRNAs) are in limited supply. We show that the UUA-specific tRNA Leu is particularly rare in human cell lines derived from T-lymphocytes, the cells that are targeted by HIV-1. Furthermore, we have characterized the role of the second slippery site in supporting -1FS. Multiple ways to modulate the frameshifting efficiency could help the virus to maintain the Gag to Gag-Pol ratio, which is crucial for its viability.",

Control mRNAs used to determine the rate of Arg-tRNA Arg incorporation in 0frame (Supplementary Figure S3B) were made by chemical synthesis (IBA, G\u00f6ttingen) and contained an E. coli Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence inserted 9 nt upstream of the start codon AUG. For translation in bacterial translation system, a SD sequence was inserted into the HIV mRNA 6 nt upstream of the start codon AUG. In the short mRNAs used in the codon walk experiments, AUG was introduced 8 nt upstream of the SS1 and the length of the sequence following the SS1 was 56 nt encompassing SL1 and pSS2. In the mRNAs used to study +1 and -2 frameshifting, the GGG codon (Gly) following the slippery site was mutated to UGG (Trp) to distinguish between the -1-, -2-and +1frameshifting products (10) . The nearest natural AUG in gag mRNA was used as a start codon in the long mRNAs to study gag-pol translation products by PAGE. The stop codon UAG was introduced in the 0-frame 156 nt downstream of the AUG and 120 nt after the SS1 to allow the separation between the 0-frame (52 aa) and -1-frame (120 aa) products. 0-, -1-and -2-frame control mRNAs contain respective sequence cloned in-frame with SS1 and pSS2 being mutated to prevent slippages; these mRNAs contained 324 nt after the SS1 harboring SL1, pSS2 and pSL2. HIV mRNAs for eukaryotic translation contained the native 5' UTR from rabbit \u2424-globin mRNA and a Kozak sequence with an embedded AUGG site to allow for efficient initiation. The start codon AUG was placed 8 nt upstream of the slippery site, and the next codon CAG (Gln) was mutated to GAG (Val) to improve initiation and facilitate product separation by HPLC. Eukaryotic mRNAs contained 167 nt downstream of SS1 covering SL1, pSS2 and pSL2.

Then aa-tRNAs were added and incubated for 1 min at 37 \u2022 C. The concentrations of aa-tRNAs were optimized to ensure the maximum binding at their respective codon: 1.6 M each for Gln-tRNA Gln , Ala-tRNA Ala , Asn-tRNA Asn , Phe-tRNA Phe and Arg-tRNA Arg , 1.2 M for Gly-tRNA Gly , and different concentrations of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu as indicated. IC (0.16 M) was mixed with TCs (about 20 M final concentration of EF-Tu), EF-G (1.6 M), GTP (1 mM) phosphoenolpyruvate (2.4 mM) and pyruvate kinase (0.08 mg/ml) in HiFi buffer at 37 \u2022 C. Incubation times were 0-10 min for time courses or 2 min for end-point measurements. The stability of peptidyl-tRNA binding to the ribosome was tested by nitrocellulose filter binding assay (Supplementary Figure S3D) . To prepare samples for the HPLC analysis, the reactions were quenched with KOH (0.5 M) and hydrolyzed for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C; then the samples were neutralized by the addition of acetic acid. Translation products were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on an RP-8 column (LiChro-Spher100, Merck) applying an adapted gradient of acetonitrile (0-65%) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted fractions were mixed with Ultima Gold XR scintillation liquid (Perkin Elmer) and analyzed by scintillation counting. The peptide products up to MQAN were not separated from each other, while all other peptides could be identified by either position shift on a chromatogram or by the radioactive label of the respective amino acid. The amount of each product was determined as a ratio between 3 Hcounts in the respective peak and total 3 H-counts in the eluate. For samples with [ 3 H]Gly-tRNA Gly , [ 14 C]Arg-tRNA Arg or [ 14 C]Leu tRNA NAA Leu , the respective peaks were calculated in pmol. Where necessary, the amount of MQAN-FLR peptide was calculated by subtracting MQANFLG from MQANFL in pmol.

Time courses were evaluated by numerical integration in KinTek Explorer software (45) .

            "text": "We first aimed to solve the mechanism of -1FS on the HIV-1 mRNA. For the mechanistic work, we used the fully reconstituted translation system from E. coli, because the overall efficiency and the ratio of the FLR and FFR products is similar in mammalian cells and in E. coli (5, 15, 23, 24) , the functional centers of the ribosomes where frameshifting takes place are highly conserved between eukaryotes and prokaryotes (54) , and it is not feasible to prepare materials for the reconstituted eukaryotic translation system in amounts needed for this type of analysis. We first tested the potential routes for frameshifting. The model HIV-1 gag-pol mRNA encompasses the natural frameshifting site with the translation start codon AUG three codons upstream of the slippery site ( Figure 1B) . We formed a 70S initiation complex with the mRNA and fMet-tRNA fMet and started translation by the addition of ternary complexes of elongation factor (EF)-Tu-GTP with the desired combination of purified aa-tRNAs and EF-G-GTP. Consecutive amino acid incorporation results in a 0-frame peptide fMet-Gln-Ala-Asn-Phe-Leu-Gly (MQANFLG) and the -1-frame peptides fMet-Gln-Ala-Asn-Phe-Leu-Arg (MQANFLR) or fMet-Gln-Ala-Asn-Phe-Phe-Arg (MQANFFR). Peptides were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) (Supplementary Figure S1 ). The overall frameshifting efficiency was determined as a yield of -1-frame Arg incorporation relative to the sum of -1-and 0-frame peptides. With the mRNA containing a native slippery sequence, a large fraction of peptides contains Arg ( Figure 1B) , indicating efficient -1FS. As expected, the U 4 C mutation, which changes the SS1 sequence to U UUC UUA (5), abolishes FS ( Figure  1B and Supplementary Figure S3A) .",

            "text": "In principle, -1FS can occur at the decoding step of the translation elongation cycle, when only peptidyl-tRNA is bound in the P site of the ribosome while the A site is vacant (15, 55) , or during translocation, when two tRNAs together with the mRNA move through the ribosome (56) (57) (58) (59) . If slippage occurred during decoding, the -1FS efficiency must depend on the competition between the 0-frame and -1-frame aa-tRNAs, Leu-tRNA and Phe-tRNA, for binding at the UUUA sequence in SS1. In fact, the addition of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu (E. coli tRNA that reads the UUA and UUG codons; the anticodon is indicated as a subscript; N is a post-transcriptionally modified nucleotide) dramatically lowers the -1FS efficiency from about 50% in the absence to 12% in the presence of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu ( Figure 1C) . In contrast, a mixture of near-cognate Leu-tRNA isoacceptors that collectively read the CUN family of Leu codons has no effect. The high -1FS efficiency observed in the absence of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu indicates that ribosomes can slip into the -1-frame prior to, and independent of, Leu incorporation. By estimating the ratio of Leu, Phe and Arg incorporation into the -1-frame product, we can determine how the -1FS pathway changes with the Leu-tRNA NAA Leu concentration ( Figure 1D ). In the absence of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu , only the FFR product is formed. Upon addition of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu , the FLR product becomes prevalent. Thus, frameshifting at the gag-pol slippery site can switch between two regimes and their prevalence depends on the concentration of the critical tRNA.",

Again, if frameshifting took place during decoding, the 0-frame Gly-tRNA Gly and -1-frame Arg-tRNA Arg should compete for binding to the ribosome. This is, however, not observed, as the -1FS efficiency is independent of Gly-tRNA Gly and Arg-tRNA Arg concentrations ( Figure 1E ). This finding suggests that slippage and commitment to the new reading frame occur after Leu incorporation, but prior to decoding of the next codon by Gly-or Arg-tRNA. This is similar to the well-studied cases of -1FS on IBV 1a/1b and dnaX mRNAs, where slippage occurs at a late stage of translocation of the slippery-site tRNAs, and suggests a similar two-tRNA frameshifting mechanism (55-60). The UUA codon is particularly rare in human cells and the respective Leu-tRNA NAA Leu is underrepresented is some cell types (see below and (53)). Because formation of the -1-frame FFR product depends on the slippage at the 'hungry' UUA codon, we further tested whether this allows also -2 and +1FS. We note that normally such slippage events would lead to premature termination due to stop codons appearing in the -2 or +1 frames downstream of the frameshifting site and that such peptides are difficult to detect in vivo, but alternative slippage events could change the ratio between the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins. To distinguish between the products of the 0-, -1-, -2-and +1-FS, we changed the GGG (Gly) codon following the slippery site into UGG (Trp) (Figure 2 and Supplementary Figure S2 ), a mutation that does not affect the -1FS efficiency in vivo in human cells (10) . In addition to the aa-tRNAs needed for translation of the MQANFL sequence, we added purified Trp-tRNA Trp (W), elongator Met-tRNA Met (M) and Tyr-tRNA Tyr (Y). The expected 0-frame peptide is now MQANFLW and the -1frame peptides are MQANFFM and MQANFLM. Shifting into the +1-frame should yield MQANFY and into the -2-frame MQANFFY and MQANFLY. When all required aa-tRNAs are present, the -1-frame peptides account for about 25% of product, consistent with the -1FS efficiency on the native gag-pol sequence in the presence of equimolar amounts of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu and ribosomes ( Figure  2 ), whereas the amounts of the +1 and -2 peptides are small. When Met-tRNA Met is omitted, -2FS increases more than 2-fold, whereas the +1FS is not changed. -2FS is enhanced because -1FS exposes a 'hungry' Met codon in the A site, which favors the slippage. In the absence of Leu-and Trp-tRNA, -1FS efficiency increases to 45%, as expected; -2FS is unchanged; and again a small amount of the +1frame product is formed. Without addition of Leu-, Trp-and Met-tRNA, the products of all three alternative frames are found. These data suggest that -2 and +1FS can occur when one or more of the aa-tRNAs are lacking; however, when all aa-tRNAs are available the -1FS pathway is prevalent.",

Because a fraction of initiation complexes does not enter translation, we introduced a step that accounts for this unproductive population (M \u2192 M n , non-reactive). We also noticed that MQANF-tRNA Phe in the absence of the A-site ligand tends to slowly dissociate from the ribosome (Supplementary Figure S3D) ; to account for this loss of peptidyl-tRNA we introduced the respective drop-off reaction. Global fitting of the time courses using numerical integration yielded a unique solution for all rate constants ( Figure 3A and B; Supplementary Table  S1 ). The step leading to the incorporation of the second Phe is slow, \u223c0.01 s \u22121 , compared to all translation steps, which are at least 10 times faster. MQANFF peptides do not accumulate and are converted to the -1-frame peptide, MQANFFR.

If Leu is incorporated, the 0-frame MQANFL product can partition between the 0-frame MQANFLG and the -1-frame MQANFLR. Global fitting of the time courses gives well-defined rate constants for most of the steps (Figure 3C-E) . The rate-limiting step for the -1-frame FFR pathway has a rate constant of \u223c0.03 s \u22121 , similar to that for the isolated FFR pathway. The efficiency of the FFR pathway depends on the ratio of the rates of -1-slippage and Leu-tRNA NAA Leu binding. While the rate of slippage is constant, the rate of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu binding increases with concentration. This explains why the addition of excess Leu-tRNA NAA Leu inhibits the FFR route. At high concentrations of Leu-tRNA NAA Leu , the probability to bind Leu-tRNA NAA Leu to the A site is higher than to slip into the -1 -frame. At this condition, the FFR pathway is suppressed and only the FLR pathway remains operational.

HIV-1 mainly infects CD4 + T-lymphocytes and macrophages (61) . We determined the ratio of Leu-tRNA UAA Leu to Leu-tRNA CAG Leu reading the most abundant Leu codon CUG. Leu-tRNA UAA Leu is 7-17-fold less abundant than Leu-tRNA CAG Leu in cell lines derived from T lymphocytes, and about 20-fold in HeLa cells, whereas in other types of human cells the ratio is about 1:3 ( Figure 4) . The Leu-tRNA UAA Leu concentration varies by as much as 10-fold, whereas for Leu-tRNA CAG Leu the differences are smaller, except for HeLa cells, where the Leu-tRNA CAG Leu concentration is increased (Supplementary Figure S4A) . As a control, we quantified the relative abundance of Val-tRNA Val isoacceptors reading a rare GUA codon and an abundant GUG codon. The tRNA UAC Val isoacceptor reading the rare codon is about 7-8 times less abundant than common tRNA CAC Val , except for the 293T epithelial cells, where the amount of tRNA UAC Val is even lower (Figure 4 ).

Formation of 0-frame and -1-frame products starts after a 30-s delay that may be caused by an early translational pausing event (appearing as a prominent peptide band between 7 and 30 s of translation (Figure 5B and C; Supplementary Figure S4E ). In contrast, the -2-frame product appears after a much longer delay of 120 s. At this time, the synthesis of the 0-frame product is already completed on most ribosomes, suggesting that the -2FS may arise on a fraction of ribosomes that undergo long translation pausing. Addition of exogenous Leu-tRNA NAA Leu decreases the -1FS efficiency to 4% ( Figure  5D and Supplementary Figure S4F) . A similarly reduced FS efficiency is observed when the UUA codon is mutated to UUC, which does not interrupt the slippery run of six Us, but changes the identity of the tRNA reading the second slippery codon to the abundant tRNA Phe ( Figure 5E ). Thus, reassigning the second codon of the slippery site to an abundant tRNA has the same effect as adding excess of tRNA NAA Leu to the native sequence. Shortening the slippery site to four U residues decreased FS to 2%. Disrupting SS1 alone or together with pSS2 diminishes the FS efficiency to about 1%, which is the background level of these experiments ( Figure 5E and Supplementary Figure S5B ).",

To synthesize the 0-frame MVAN-FLG and the -1-frame MVANFLR peptides, we used the tRNA from HeLa cells aminoacylated with a mixture of the required amino acids with or without Leu; incorporation of the -1-frame Arg was monitored by the HPLC analysis (Supplementary Figure S4G) . As controls, we included the mRNA coding for MVANFLR in 0-frame (-1-frame control), which provides the estimate for the maximum Arg incorporation, and the mRNA without the SS1 but with SL1 (0-frame control). The -1FS efficiency in this fully reconstituted eukaryotic translation system is about 20-25% in the presence of native amounts of tRNA UAA Leu ( Figure 5F and Supplementary Figure S4G ). When leucine was omitted from the aminoacylation mixture, the -1FS efficiency increases to 40% ( Figure 5F ). Thus, Leu-tRNA UAA Leu modulates -1FS efficiency on HIV mRNA also in the homologous mammalian translation system.",

The -2FS efficiency is higher when both SS1 and pSS2 are slippery, suggesting that -2FS results from dual -1-slippage on both sites rather than from -2slippage on pSS2 alone. Replacing the rare CUU codon in pSS2 with the abundant CUG reduces -2FS indicating that the second slippage is due to 'hungry' FS on pSS2. When the U-string in SS1 is disrupted, the frameshifting efficiency is higher in the construct where pSS2 is slippery compared to the native sequence. The presumed secondary structure of the mRNA downstream of pSS2 (Supplementary Figure  S5 ) has no effect. Disruption of both slippery sites decreases frameshifting to background levels. Thus, pSS2 supports a low-level FS event that can rescue HIV-1 when SS1 is mutated, but also causes -2FS, which in the native sequence leads to premature termination of translation.",

The switch between the two regimes is modulated by the availability of the UUA-specific tRNA Leu , which we show to be rare in cell lines derived from human immune cells. This notion is supported by in vivo experiments indicating that limitation of Leu in the culture media leads to increased -1FS in E. coli (15) . The exact -1FS efficiency on the gag-pol mRNA differs depending on the type of model system, a phenomenon that has been noted before and attributed to different translation rates in vivo and in vitro (18, 19, 63, 64) ; presumably, the presence of the bulk aa-tRNA also plays a role (compare Figures 1C and 5C ).

            "text": "As the ratio of the Gag and Gag-Pol products is crucial for virus propagation (6-9), HIV-1 must have evolved to achieve the desired -1FS efficiency at the concentrations of tRNA UAA Leu prevalent in human cells. The UUA codon is rare in the human genome, as are all other A-ending codons. The respective cognate tRNA UAA Leu is significantly underrepresented in the tRNA pool as compared to tRNA CAG Leu that reads the abundant CUG codon (Figure 4) (53) . While in eukaryotes the tRNA expression is tissue-specific, the relative expression of tRNA isoacceptors in some tissues shows statistically significant correlation to the codon usage of tissue-specific genes (69) . The low relative abundance of tRNA UAA Leu in the lymphocyte-derived cell types may be a result of adaptation to the codon usage in these cells. On the other hand, the rare UUA codon accounts for 45% of all Leu codons in late-expressing HIV-1 genes including gag and pol (70) (71) (72) . Expression of the late HIV genes would increase the demand for a tRNA UAA Leu that is rare in the respective cells, which may delay the decoding at any UUA codon, including the key codon in the slippery sequence. When the delivery to the UUA codon at the slippery site is too slow, the ribosome switches to the FFR route leading to robust -1FS. The codon usage disparity between HIV and its human host can be utilized to disrupt the late stage of virus production (73) . For example, the interferon-induced antiviral protein Schlafen 11 (SLFN11) selectively abrogates the expression of late viral proteins in a codon-usagedependent manner (73) . SLFN11 induces specific cleavage of tRNAs with a long variable loop, which include all serine and leucine tRNAs. If the already rare tRNA, such as tRNA UAA Leu , is further reduced, tRNA availability might manifest as the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of proteins involving those tRNAs (73) . A tRNA-dependent modulation of frameshifting was also reported within the expanded CAG stretch in the huntingtin gene (74) : the translation of expanded CAG repeats in mutant huntingtin exon 1 leads to a depletion of charged Gln-tRNA CUG Gln that pairs to the CAG codon, which results in translational frameshifting. The frameshifting frequency varies strongly among different cell lines and is higher in cells with intrinsically lower concentrations of tRNA CUG Gln (74) , which emphasizes the biological significance of tRNA concentrations in modulating frameshifting efficiencies.",

            "text": "Anti-HIV therapy with protease inhibitors leads to accumulation of mutations in the HIV-1 protease that impair the recognition of its specific cleavage sites. To allow for polyprotein maturation by the mutated protease, secondary mutations arise at the pSS2, which harbors the p1/p6 cleavage site of Gag polyprotein (75) (76) (77) (78) (79) . The C 5 U mutation in pSS2 substitutes Leu with Phe, which enhances van der Waals interactions between the substrate and the mutant protease, thereby increasing the protease activity by about 10-fold (80) . The same mutation produces a slippery sequence that can support -1FS, but the role of pSS2 depends on the sequence of SS1. With native SS1, the joint activity of SS1 and pSS2 is not different from SS1 alone, but when SS1 is mutated to a non-shifty sequence, the C 5 U mutation in the pSS2 is sufficient to support a level of -1FS that may be sufficient for virus propagation. The finding that pSS2 can alleviate the detrimental effects of SS1 mutations is consistent with previous in vitro and in vivo reports (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . Interestingly, during antiviral therapy, drug-resistant herpes simplex viruses also develop an unusual slippery site that supports both -1 and +1FS at levels sufficient for virus replication and pathogenicity despite the treatment (81, 82) . Similarly, the C 5 U mutation in the pSS2 of gag-pol HIV-1 mRNA does not only modulate the FS efficiency, but also improves the activity of mutant proteases that emerge upon protease inhibitor treatment. The evolutionary pressure that has led to the conservation of pSS2 in HIV-1 is not known, but this sequence seems to allow rapid adaptation to anti-viral therapy (31) . Thus, HIV-1 constitutively uses different FS regimes that have evolved to ensure a low but crucial level of FS required for its proliferation.",
