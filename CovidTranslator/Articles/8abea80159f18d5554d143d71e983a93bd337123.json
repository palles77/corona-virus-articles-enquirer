Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting, but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Children and elderly people are at increased risk, especially in developing countries. Childhood pneumonia is the leading single cause of mortality in children aged less than 5 years. The incidence in this age group is estimated to be 0.29 episodes per child-years in developing countries and 0.05 episodes per child-years in developed countries. This translates into about 156 million new episodes each year worldwide, of which 151 million episodes are in the developing world. Pneumonia is responsible for about 19% of all deaths in children aged less than 5 years, of which more than 70% take place in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. On the other side of the age spectrum, pneumonia is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older people, with an annual incidence for noninstitutionalized patients estimated at between 25 and 44 per 1000 population -up to four times that of patients younger than 65 years of age.",

Key amino acids in these proteins, particularly in HA, are associated with host specificity and transmissibility in humans. Aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of influenza A viruses, harboring all possible subtypes. A selection of subtypes has established endemicity among a range of land and water mammals (e.g. humans, pigs, horses, seals; Fig. 29 .1).

Oseltamivir was widely used in the developed world and, to a lesser extent, in the developing world to treat infection with 2009 H1N1. Development of resistance during treatment for both classes of drugs is a common phenomenon and is more frequently observed in children. In addition, the dominant lineages of H3N2 and H1N1 in the 2007-2008 season were resistant against adamantanes and oseltamivir, respectively. Resistance against zanamivir is rare, but its route of administration limits use in severe disease. In some parts of the world (especially Southeast Asia), antibiotics are extensively used to treat any form of mild respiratory illness. Although there may be some benefit of the use of antibiotics in preventing secondary bacterial infection, over-the-counter availability of antibiotics, self-medication or medication by untrained pharmacy workers should be discouraged because of the selection and subsequent spread of resistance in commensal oral and gut flora.",

The major symptom is wheezing, accompanied by flaring of the nostrils, use of accessory respiratory muscles and cyanosis in more severe cases. Direct viral infection of the bronchiolar epithelial cells, followed by necrosis, infiltration of lymphocytes, submucosal swelling and increased mucus secretion results in the formation of dense plugs of debris that cause impediment of airflow, particularly expiratory. Children may experience repeated episodes of wheezing after recovery from bronchiolitis. Associations with later development of asthma and a causative role of the immune system in pathogenesis of bronchiolitis have been suggested.",

There is acute generalized illness and a dry cough, rhinitis and conjunctivitis may be present. An increased respiratory rate is an early feature, with cyanosis developing in very severe disease. Viruses reach the small airways either through continuous spread or by inhalation of aerosols. Mucosal infection leads to destruction of epithelial cells, submucosal hyperemia, edema of the airways and hemorrhaging. Additional cellular infiltration and fibrin depositions may further compromise respiratory volume and gas exchange surface [17] . Viral pneumonia can be part of severe forms of measles and varicella, and may be secondary to generalized infections with EBV or CMV. In infections with New World hantaviruses, pulmonary symptoms are dominant but are, instead, caused by immune-mediated capillary leak.",

The working hypothesis is that wild aquatic birds are the primordial reservoir of all influenza viruses for avian and mammalian species. Transmission of influenza has been demonstrated between pigs and humans (solid lines). There is extensive evidence for transmission between aquatic birds and other species including pigs and horses and indirect transmission to humans through pigs and evidence for direct transmission to humans from chickens (with permission from Elsevier Ltd, Encyclopedia of Virology 2nd edition; 1999; pp 824-829).such an introduction, the new virus becomes the dominant circulating lineage of influenza A. One exception was the re-introduction of H1N1 in the human population in 1977, which was possibly caused by an escape from a research laboratory. Since 1977, two lineages of H1N1 and H3N2 influenza A viruses have been co-circulating among humans, causing yearly seasonal epidemics worldwide(Fig. 29.2). Influenza B viruses co-circulate with influenza A viruses and also cause yearly epidemics but have not been associated with pandemics.In 2009, a novel lineage of H1N1 influenza A virus emerged, most likely from pigs, in North America and caused a worldwide pandemic of relatively mild influenza. At the time of writing, the pandemic has passed and around 18,000 people died from infection during the pandemic phase. The virus has now become established as a seasonal virus, has largely replaced the former H1N1 virus and is co-circulating with H3N2.Sporadic, dead-end human infections of animal viruses are known to occur and have caused concern about the pandemic potential of these viruses. H7N7, H7N3 and H9N2 viruses have caused conjunctivitis and mild, flu-like illness in patients who were in close contact with infected birds or seals. In contrast, H5N1 avian influenza viruses have caused severe human respiratory illness in Asia and North Africa, with a mortality of over 50%. Highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses were first detected in birds in 1996 in China. Transmission to 18 humans",
