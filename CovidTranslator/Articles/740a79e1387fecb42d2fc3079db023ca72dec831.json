Here, we studied whether these patches are defined architectures with features for virus binding and/ or internalization. Super-resolution microscopy reveals that the patches are assemblies of closely associated nanoclusters of CD151, integrin \u03b13 and integrin \u03b16. Integrin \u03b16 is required for virus attachment and integrin \u03b13 for endocytosis. We propose that CD151 organizes viral entry platforms with different types of integrin clusters for different functionalities. Since numerous viruses use tetraspanin patches, we speculate that this building principle is a blueprint for cell-surface architectures utilized by viral particles.",

To clarify the role of integrin \u03b13 in the infection of keratinocytes, we infected integrin \u03b13 depleted HaCaT cells by incubation with HPV16 pseudovirions (PsVs). For positive control, cells were depleted from integrin \u03b16, which is required for infection of HeLa and KH-SV cells 5,21 . In Western blot analysis, knockdown reduced integrin \u03b16 and integrin \u03b13 protein levels by 87% and 97%, respectively (Fig. S1 ). Intracellular processing of the L1 virus capsid protein was monitored by Western blot analysis and by microscopy. In the Western blots, we quantified the ~25 kDa cleavage product of L1, which is generated only after internalization and lysosomal degradation of the virus 22 . As seen in Fig. 1A , knockdown of integrin \u03b13 and integrin \u03b16 reduced the cleavage product by 73% and 44%, respectively. For microscopy, we employed antibody-detection of the L1-7 epitope, which only becomes detectable after intracellular capsid disassembly 4,23 . Knockdown of either one of the integrins reduced the number of L1-7 positive organelles to about 65% (Fig. 1B,C) . Moreover, organelles were slightly dimmer (Fig. S2) , suggesting that apart from less forming endocytic organelles the viral load per organelle diminishes.",

Infection is inhibited by 88% and 67% after integrin \u03b13 and integrin \u03b16 knockdown, respectively (Fig. 1D) . It should be noted that integrin knockdown has secondary effects (Fig. S3) . Still, after correcting for these secondary effects, knockdown of each integrin more than halves the infection rate (Fig. S3) . These experiments demonstrate that apart from integrin \u03b16, integrin \u03b13 plays a role in HPV infection of HaCaT cells as well. However, in Western blot analysis testing PsVs cell-surface primary binding only the knockdown of integrin \u03b16 strongly inhibits binding by 40% (Fig. 2) , suggesting each of these integrins is differently involved during infection.",

To shed light on this question, we tested the effect of integrin knockdown on infection in a luciferase-based infection assay. Moreover, we studied intracellular virus processing and cell-surface binding by Western blot analysis and microscopy. Finally, we examined the organization of integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b16 and CD151 by super-resolution microscopy. We found out that both integrins play a role in infection and cellular uptake, but only integrin \u03b16 is required for cell-surface binding. In addition to this, the local density of integrin \u03b13, integrin \u03b16 and CD151 CD151/integrin distribution. Biochemical pulldown assays suggest that integrin \u03b13 and integrin \u03b16 directly interact with CD151 [24] [25] [26] . Consequently, these molecules should co-localize in the cell membrane. For verification, we studied triple co-localization of GFP-labelled CD151, integrin \u03b13 and integrin \u03b16 in the cell membrane. We employed cell-free membrane sheets to assure that we examine only plasma membrane associated proteins. Furthermore, STED super-resolution microscopy was employed, which enabled us to resolve diffraction limited signals into smaller spots (Fig. S4 ).",

The sizes show a lognormal distribution, in particular for integrin \u03b13 (Fig. S5 ).

Integrin \u03b13 maxima are less numerous, likely because its expression level is lower when compared to integrin \u03b16 27 . CD151-GFP maxima are larger than 200 nm and less-defined, with more background signal in their neighbourhood (Fig. 3A) . Correction for the PSF yields a diameter of 189 nm. The lower signal-to-noise ratio is due to the lower signal intensity of the nanobody staining applied for the visualization of CD151-GFP in STED microscopy.

None of the three protein types is evenly distributed but rather concentrates in segregated maxima which have a diameter in the 100-200 nm range ( Fig. 3B and S5 ). Determination of the exact size is difficult as the lognormal distribution of the maxima sizes ( Fig. S5 ) suggests that our STED microscope cannot resolve size differences within the fraction of smaller maxima. Hence, as smaller maxima appear larger, we overestimate the average size. On the other hand, the smallest maxima may arise from single proteins and therefore are not protein clusters anyway. In any case, the data suggests that most maxima do not arise from single molecules but from larger aggregates as protein clusters, that typically are in the same size range as protein clusters formed by other proteins [29] [30] [31] .",

In the first case the maxima distance would be zero, in the latter case it is the sum of the radii of the two associated maxima. In this study, the inter-maxima distances range from 100-300 nm (Fig. 3D ) and clearly point to closely associated maxima (see magnified view of the overlay in Fig. 3A ). It should be noted that in this experiment CD151 was overexpressed. CD151-GFP and endogenous CD151 maxima depend in the same fashion from the expression level ( Fig. S7A-D) ; overexpression increases the number of maxima, accompanied by a moderate increase in maxima size. On the other hand, the maxima density is underestimated due to the low-signal-to noise ratio of the nanobody (please note that the maxima density of CD151-GFP is lower than for endogenous CD151 (Fig. S7B,D) ). This does not affect the CD151-integrin distances (107-144 nm; Fig. 3D ) but leads to an overestimation of the CD151-CD151 inter-maxima distances (314 nm; Fig. 3D ). Despite of this overestimation, we can safely conclude that the CD151 and integrin maxima do not perfectly overlap but are very close to one another. In other words, the three maxima types group together.",

The induction of large cluster crowds by viral particles is suggested by previous studies which employed tetraspanin overexpression 3, 32 . It is possible that overexpression of tetraspanins promotes the growth of the tetraspanin crowds (see below), amplifying an otherwise moderate viral particle patching effect. In any case, our data would be also in line with a preference for associating with larger cluster crowds instead of inducing them. Altogether, we suggest that these crowds are entry platforms with a composition different from the rest of the cell membrane. On the level of individual PSV attachment sites, platform size and composition are highly variable (Fig. S12) , perhaps because the analysis covers a full range of states from early to fully formed platforms. We speculate that a fully formed platform, briefly before internalization, is best represented by the example mentioned above with at least 9 + 22 = 31 clusters (not including integrin \u03b13) in an area of 1 \u00b5m 2 .",

Moreover, upon internalisation, viral particles and CD151 signals both disappear from the TIRF field, indicating their co-internalisation 5 . In our experiments PsVs diminish the level of CD151-GFP by 22% ( Fig. S9 ; see also Fig. 6B for a 20% diminshment of endogenous CD151), integrins diminish less. Effects are small because of (i) systematic underestimation (also uninfected cells are included in the analysis) and (ii) maxima are much more numerous than virus particles, so that viral particles can affect only a small maxima subpopulation. However, the data suggest that these components and PsVs are co-internalized, in line with the above-mentioned live imaging experiment.",

Perhaps this is because of clusters being reservoirs of active molecules 38 , representing only the non-interacting protein pool. In this case, PsVs could still be directly bound to integrin \u03b16, although not to clusters but to single molecules released from the clusters into the platform area. Clusters being reservoirs would also explain the absence of perfect overlap between CD151-and integrin-maxima, as only molecules at the cluster peripheries interact. Alternatively, PsV binding to its receptor can decrease the accessibility of the antibody, which would also lead to a lack of signal overlap. However, it is possible that viral particles bind to another type of primary receptor in the platform, most likely HSPGs 36, 39 , which would explain why half of the viral particles are still bound to the cells after knockdown, despite of a relatively high knockdown efficiency. Certainly, there must be more proteins in the platform, as for instance the tetraspanin CD63, which after PsV-contact with the cell-surface forms very similar patches or cluster crowds 3, 4 . Other candidates are growth factor receptors which associate with CD151 and HPV16 28, 40 . Moreover, integrins are present as heterodimers, possibly associating with molecules that couple integrin signalling to the cytoskeleton. Perhaps virus associated CD151 patches overlapping with actin accumulations (Fig. 7) are focal adhesion related signalling hubs linking intracellular actin bundles to extracellular components 41 .

CD151-integrin association occurs early during biosynthesis 46 , notably also with integrin \u03b16 precursor forms 47 .

Interestingly, treatment with anti-integrin \u03b13 antibody had the very same effect, suggesting each antibody crosslinks the same cellular entity. This supports the idea of viral entry platform components defined by these molecules. Moreover, crosslinking of proteins from the extracellular site by antibodies or viral particles may be sufficient for triggering intracellular actin accumulation. CD151 is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization 57 and HPV internalization is an actin-dependent process 35, 59 . We speculate that virus entry requires a considerable amount of CD151 clusters because for internalization actin-reorganization must be coordinated over a larger membrane area. The growth size of the platform may depend on the density of CD151 or other tetraspanin clusters and could therefore differ between cell types, and be influenced by overexpression as well. In the example shown in Fig. 7 CD151-GFP is overexpressed and the shown patches are larger than the platforms in Fig. 5 , possibly due to an increased density of CD151 clusters which could have a promoting effect on the process of patching.",

Prior to analysis, images were smoothed with a Gaussian blur (\u03c3 = 1) to reduce pixel noise and thereby improve maxima detection. The coordinates of detected maxima were used for further analysis. For maxima intensity, a 2 pixel radius circular ROI was placed at the maxima location and the mean intensity value was measured. Maxima with a low mean intensity (depending on the experiment <1-3 a.u.) were excluded from the further analysis. For inter-maxima distance analysis, the nearest neighbor of each maxima in the same or the other channel was calculated. To this end, first all distances between one and the other maxima were calculated, followed by extracting the shortest one. The maxima size was determined by applying a vertical and a horizontal 31 \u00d7 3 pixel line scan at the maxima position. A Gaussian function was fitted to the intensity distribution. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian was taken as maxima size. Depending on the best fit quality, the size value was taken either from the horizontal or vertical scan. Maxima with a fit quality of R 2 < 0.8 and a non-centered peak (not in the middle third of the linescan) were excluded. For each individual cell or membrane sheet, all maxima parameter values were averaged. The maxima density was obtained by relating the number of maxima to the size of the analyzed area.",

Quantification of the pseudovirions (viral genome equivalents (vge)) was performed by quantitative PCR using a 7500 Real-Time PCR System and Sequence Detection Software v2.3 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA)69 .Cell culture and transfection. Human immortalized keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) were purchased fromCell Lines Services (Eppelheim, Germany). The human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa cells) was obtained from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures ((DSMZ), Braunschweig, Germany). HaCaT cells were maintained in high glucose (4.5 g/l) DMEM (cat# P04-03550 PAN Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (cat# S0615, Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin working solution (cat# P06-07100, PAN Biotech) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . For infection, rescue, and promoter assays, HaCaT and HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM/FCS as above, 1% MEM non-essential amino acid solution (cat# M7145-100 ML, Sigma Aldrich), and 5 \u00b5g/ml ciprofloxacin (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg vor der Hoehe, Germany).Cell line identities were confirmed by ShortTandemRepeat (STR) analysis (Mycrosynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland). Cell lines were tested negative for mycoplasma employing a mycoplasma detection kit (MycoAlert PLUS Mycoplasma Detection Kit, Lonza, Koeln, Germany) and by Microsynth Real-Time PCR analysis (order ID 004264 and 004266; Microsynth, Lindau, Germany). For transfection with pEGFP-C1/CD151, HaCaT cells were detached by incubation for 10 min in trypsin solution (cat# P10-0231SP, PAN Biotech). Trypsin activity was stopped by adding culture medium. Cells were washed once in DPBS (cat# P04-36500, PAN-Biotech), resuspended in cytomix solution (120 mM KCl, 10 mM KH 2 PO4, 0.15 mM CaCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 25 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6), and 2 \u00d7 10 6 cells were transferred together with 15 \u00b5g plasmid DNA into an electroporation cuvette. HaCaTs were electroporated with a Gene pulser Xcell electroporation system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) employing 200 V, 950 \u03bcF and 200 \u03a9. Cells were plated onto poly-L-lysine-coated (PLL) glass-coverslips (~3 * 10 5 cells/coverslip), incubated for 24 h in culture medium at 37 \u00b0C, and used for experiments. For siRNA knockdown, we employed the following pooled duplex siRNAs: for integrin \u03b16, \u03b16#1 (GGAUAUGCCUC CAGGUUAA[dT][dT]) and \u03b16#2 (CUGUAAGGAUCCGGAAAGA[dT][dT]), and for integrin \u03b13 \u03b13#1 (GCUACAU GAUUCAGCGCAA[dT][dT]) and \u03b13#2 (GUUUGAAGGCUUGGGCAAA[dT][dT]) (Sigma-Aldrich). For control, AllStars Negative control siRNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was used. For transfection, HaCaT cells were seeded onto PLL-coated glass coverslips or plastic 6-well plates (100,000 cells/well) and incubated overnight in cell culture medium. Then, cells were incubated with 30 nM siRNA using RNAiMAX Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were used 48 h later for experiments.",
