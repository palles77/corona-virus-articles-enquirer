            "text": "The filoviruses, Ebola virus (EBOV), and Marburg virus (MARV), are among the most pathogenic viruses known to man and the causative agents of viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks in Africa with case fatality rates of up to 90%. Nearly 30,000 infections were observed in the latest EBOV epidemic in West Africa; previous outbreaks were much smaller, typically only affecting less than a few hundred people. Compared to other diseases such as AIDS or Malaria with millions of cases annually, filovirus hemorrhagic fever (FHF) is one of the neglected infectious diseases. There are no licensed vaccines or therapeutics available to treat EBOV and MARV infections; therefore, these pathogens can only be handled in maximum containment laboratories and are classified as select agents. Under these limitations, a very few laboratories worldwide conducted basic research and countermeasure development for EBOV and MARV since their respective discoveries in 1967 (MARV) and 1976 (EBOV). In this review, we discuss several vaccine platforms against EBOV and MARV, which have been assessed for their protective efficacy in animal models of FHF. The focus is on the most promising approaches, which were accelerated in clinical development (phase I-III trials) during the EBOV epidemic in West Africa.",

            "text": "The discovery of two negative-strand RNA viruses, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV), in 1967 and 1976 [1] , respectively, has marked the beginning of an era of Marburg and Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreaks (MHF and EHF, respectively) in Africa, in both humans and nonhuman primates. Both viruses are members of the Filoviridae family in the order of Mononegavirales and are classified as category A pathogens and select agents. With no licensed vaccine or treatment available for human use, these pathogens can only be handled in maximum containment laboratories, which impedes research and countermeasure development [1] . Ebolavirus is composed of five known species: Zaire ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus, Bundibugyo ebolavirus, and Reston ebolavirus with some of them known for causing disease with up to 90% case fatality rates [1] . In contrast, only one species has been discovered within the genus Marburgvirus, the Marburg marburgvirus, since its initial discovery in Marburg, Germany represented by Marburg virus (MARV) and Ravn virus (RAVV). In 1967, several laboratory workers presented with flu-like symptoms that later developed into severe HF causing several of the infected individuals to die [1] . Despite more than 40 years of filovirus research, no licensed vaccine or postexposure treatment exists for either of these deadly viruses [2] .",

While rodent models provide some insight into the efficacies of filovirus vaccination, the 'gold standard' model for both EHF and MHF is the rhesus and cynomolgus macaque.

Unless otherwise specified, NHPs were always challenged with EBOV or MARV homologous to the vaccine-expressed antigen.

In addition to conventional methods, other inactivation treatments such as the photoinduced alkylation probe 1,5-iodonaphthylazide (INA) have shown similar success in the EBOV rodent models, but have not been evaluated in NHPs [6] . Similarly, successful protection of guinea pigs with irradiated, whole MARV, both strains Musoke and RAVV, has been demonstrated [7] , but limited data have been shown to be efficacious in NHPs for the inactivated virus vaccine platform [8] . While promising data for inactivated, whole-virus vaccines have been reported in filovirus rodent models, the limited immunogenicity in NHPs vaccinated by this strategy has not justified further NHP studies [3] .",

When only one administration of 10 7 FFU of EBOVDVP30 was given to NHPs, protection from lethal challenge was achieved, yet viremia and clinical signs of illness (fever) were observed [13] . This nearly whole-virus vaccine offers an interesting approach to vaccination for EBOV. The viral RNA and the majority of viral proteins (with the exception of VP30) are presented to contribute to a more complete EBOV-specific immune response [15] .

VLPs offered homologous protection in nonhuman primates, with selected studies producing broad protection to several strains of MARV. For both EBOV and MARV, VLPs were produced by expression of just two viral genes, the matrix protein VP40, as well as the respective GP in either mammalian or insect cells [6, 19] . Marburg Musoke VLPs (mVLPs) [19] were able to provide protection against three strains of MARV, MARV Musoke, MARV Ci67 and RAVV, in rodents and NHPs. A more advanced version of these VLPs was produced by the addition of the nucleoprotein (NP). These three-component VLPs were tested in cynomolgus macaques, where after three intramuscular injections of 1 mg mVLPs with 0.1 ml of QS-21 adjuvant in 42-day intervals, all animals were protected from lethal challenge with 1000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of MARV Musoke, MARV Ci67, or RAVV [19] . More recently, Dye and colleagues showed that mVLPs with QS-21 or poly I:C adjuvant are also protective against aerosol challenge with MARV in NHPs [20] . Generation of broadly protective immunity against several diverse MARV strains through a VLP system offers a promising candidate for a vaccine in humans. Similar results have been achieved for the EBOV vaccine, when using VLPs consisting of VP40, NP, and GP. While the only essential components to produce Ebola VLPs (eVLPs) are VP40 and GP, NP is often added to eVLP productions as several studies have shown that NP-specific antibodies can protect rodents from lethal EBOV challenge [21] . Warfield and colleagues achieved complete protection from lethal EBOV challenge of 1000 PFU in NHPs when three intramuscular injections spaced 42 days apart were administered with only 250 lg of eVLPs including 0.5 mL of RIBI adjuvant [6] After challenge, all animals survived, and no clinical signs were observed; in addition, no viremia could be detected at any time point by plaque assay [6] . In this study, the adjuvant greatly reduced the necessity to provide higher doses of eVLPs [22] . a Time until challenge after vaccination was completed While Warfield and colleagues have shown encouraging results in EBOV and MARV vaccination in NHPs using both mammalian and insect cell-derived VLPs, attempts to produce a pan-filovirus vaccine were unable to provide consistent protection to heterologous challenge [22] . Attempts to produce hybrid VLPs containing the GP from both MARV and EBOV were not successful in providing protection from lethal challenge of either virus. For the hybrid VLPs, GP but not VP40 was important to provide protection from homologous virus challenge [19, 23] . However, a boosting strategy increased the heterologous antibody response, and the administration of additional doses of the VLP mixture may be able to provide an efficacious pan-filovirus vaccine.",

A majority of research concerning VRP vaccination against EBOV or MARV infections has been focused on using the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV), an alphavirus vector. Replicon systems such as VEEV are used to produce a protein of interest (antigen) in place of the structural proteins for the replicon vector, thus generating a self-replicating RNA molecule, which additionally encodes proteins necessary for RNA replication [25] . The resulting VRPs can infect cells for one cycle. While the absence of VEEV structural proteins inhibits production of progeny virus, the infected cell produces ample amounts of the desired protein [25] . For both MARV and EBOV, the antigen inserted into the VRP is typically the GP, which is the target of the majority of neutralizing antibodies during filoviral infection. However, other EBOV proteins have been examined in the past as antigens using this system and it was found that, indeed, only the GP could provide complete protection in the context of the VRP system [26] .",

DNA vaccines have several benefits; they are safe to use, easy to produce, the host-cell protein synthesis allows for endogenous presentation of the desired antigen, and finally, the DNA itself provided in the vaccine can induce immune-stimulatory responses [29] . Previous studies using DNA vaccines expressing the EBOV GP in rodents resulted in both humoral and cellmediated immune responses with a correlation of survival from lethal challenge and antibody titer [29] . Underlining the importance of the humoral immune response in protection from EBOV challenge, the immunogenicity of DNA vaccines was improved using a DNA prime, followed by a viral vector boost [29] . In a preliminary mouse study, priming with DNA and boosting with a replication-incompetent adenoviral (Ad) vector expressing EBOV GP (Ad-GP(Z)) increased antibody titers about 10-100 fold, compared to DNA vaccination alone [29] . These results were followed up by a NHP study for which the animals were immunized with three multicomponent DNA injections four weeks apart, followed by an additional Ad-GP(Z) boost several months later. Infection with a lethal dose of EBOV occurred three months after the final vaccination. All vaccinated macaques survived challenge showed no clinical signs of disease, and had no detectable viremia even when examined more than six months after challenge [29] . This encouraging result led to a phase I clinical trial, in which all adults [21] who completed the vaccination schedule showed T-cell responses as well as antibodies directed to EBOV GP and NP antigens; the vaccination was well tolerated and deemed safe. A more detailed report of the trial can be found elsewhere [30] . Recently, a novel approach using codon-optimized DNA plasmids and electroporation for vaccination has shown 67% survival by itself in NHPs [31] .",

As proof-of-concept, Geisbert and colleagues demonstrated that the ADV-GP(Z) vector can no longer protect NHPs from lethal EBOV infection when these animals were exposed to Ad5 expressing no transgene prior to vaccination and challenge. Both recombinant Ad26-expressing EBOV GP (rAd26-GP) and rAd35-GP were tested individually to assess the potency of their immune responses. While both, rAd26-GP and rAd35-GP, induced neutralizing antibody responses after vaccination, neither vector alone could protect the NHPs from lethal challenge with EBOV. When the vaccine doses were increased to a range from 10 10 to 10 12 particles of either vector, partial survival was achieved. In a last experiment, NHPs were vaccinated with 10 11 particles of each rAd26-GP(Z) and -GP(S) (SUDV Gulu), then boosted one month later with 10 11 particles of rAd35-GP(Z & S). Antibody titers specific to GP as well as CD8 T-cell responses were significantly increased post-boost with rAd35 vectors, resulting in complete protection from mortality and morbidity after lethal EBOV challenge [36] . The rAd26-GP vector together with a Modified Vaccinia Ankara expressing filovirus antigens (MVA-BN-filo) was used in the UK in a phase I clinical trials and demonstrated good safety and immunogenicity with humoral immune responses lasting for over 12 months [37, 38] .",

The CAdVax system expresses the following filovirus antigens: EBOV GP, EBOV NP, SUDV GP, MARV NP, two MARV GPs (Ci67 and Musoke), and RAVV GP [40] . Filovirus NPs were incorporated into the system as they have been described to increase the cellmediated immune responses [40] . Several constructs expressing different combinations of the antigens mentioned above were generated: EBO2, expressing two copies of EBOV NP; M8, expressing MARV GP Ci67 and RAVV GP; M11, containing MARV GP Musoke and MARV NP; EBO7, expressing SUDV GP and EBOV GP. NHPs were vaccinated twice (days 0 and 63) with 4 9 10 10 PFU of the CAdVax-Panfilo vaccine (containing 1 9 10 10 PFU of each EBO2, EBO7, M8, and M11) and separated in two groups. Group 1 was challenged with a lethal dose of MARV, whereas group 2 was infected with a lethal dose of EBOV. All NHPs in both groups survived without developing any signs of disease, including no detectable viremia. In order to assess the potency of this pan-filovirus vaccine, the two groups were back-challenged with a heterologous species of filovirus. Ten weeks after the initial MARV challenge, group 1 was challenged with a lethal dose of SUDV; in a similar manner, the EBOV survivors in group 2 were infected with a lethal dose of MARV. The backchallenge resulted again in 100% protection from disease and fatal outcome for all the animals. Several studies have showed that there are no cross-reactive antibodies between EBOV and MARV, indicating that indeed the pan-filovirus vaccine conferred protection against the different filovirus challenges [40] .",

Without the limitations of pre-existing immunity by being a ChAd vector, this vaccine was accelerated for human phase I clinical trials during the 2013-2016 Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa. The vaccine was well tolerated in all participants and the antibody titers in human reached a similar level as observed in NHPs protected from EHF [42, 43] . The only concerning factor was the durability of the protective immune responses, as antibody titers in the vaccines started to drop by 6 months after vaccination [43] In order to circumvent this, a boost vaccination with a the MVA-BN-filo was implemented as this strategy had improved the immunogenicity and was previously shown to protect NHPs [41] . This strategy was first tested in a human phase I clinical trial in Mali with promising results [44] , but no long-term durability data are available yet. PFU of EBOV at 45 days after the last vaccination resulted in all animals succumbing to disease at 7 days post challenge. Without protective efficacy in NHPs, this vaccine approach was no longer regarded as a viable vaccine option against EHF [5] .",

Like all herpesviruses, CMV is strictly species-specific and as a disseminating vaccine platform can spread from vaccinated animals to the entire population while establishing a persistent infection in the host. The strict species-specificity of CMV is of great safety benefit to this platform, as animal to human, or species to species transmission is very unlikely [15] . While EBOV NP has been shown to act as a protective antigen in the context of the mouse CMV vaccine in mice [45, 46] , a proof-of-concept study in NHPs was needed to demonstrate the potential of this platform for wildlife vaccination, e.g., apes in Africa. Therefore, in a recent study, recombinant rhesus macaque CMV (RhCMV) expressing a codon-optimized EBOV GP (optZGP) was used in a prime/boost vaccination scheme in 4 rhesus macaques. Vaccination with RhCMV/EBOV GP was sufficient to protect 75% of the macaques from lethal EHF [47] . The surviving animals showed mild clinical signs of disease, and total antigen-specific IgG correlated with survival. Despite the lack of complete protection, this vaccine platform has a great potential as a disseminating wildlife vaccine among animal species that are thought to introduce EHF into the human population, e.g., bats and great apes [47] .",

Two vaccination doses protected all NHPs from morbidity and mortality, whereas signs of disease and only 88% survival were recorded when only a single dose of the vaccine was administered [52] . Recently, another group developed a similar HIPV1-based product expressing EBOV GP for intranasal application and showed immunogenicity in African green monkeys; however, no challenge data are provided [53] .",

Furthermore, CD8 T-cell responses were induced primarily in the lung and seemingly contributed to protection from lethal EHF. Protection against the EBOV infection through aerosolized vaccination represents a noninvasive way of efficient vaccine delivery and would add further to the reduction of outbreak potential as well as a preventative immunization from natural or bioterrorism threats.",

Similar to RABV, VSV belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family, and contains a negative-strand RNA genome encoding five proteins. Rose and colleagues developed the reverse genetics system for VSV allowing easy manipulation of the virus leading to optimal expression of antigens from this vector [55] . The ability for VSV to grow to very high titers in vivo, as well as in vitro in most mammalian cell lines makes it an easy-to-produce vaccine. Additionally, VSV has been shown to be a strong inducer of innate and adaptive immune responses, both advantageous properties of a vaccine vector [56] . VSV naturally infects livestock and various animals, making infection in humans very rare and disease often asymptomatic resulting in very limited pre-existing immunity in the human population. If pre-existing immunity occurs, it is mainly directed against the VSV surface protein G, which has been described as a pathogenicity factor for this virus [55, 57] . In order to circumvent complications by the presence of VSV G, two approaches have been explored; first, truncating G's cytoplasmic domain which is mainly associated with pathogenicity [58] , or second, replacing the G protein with a heterologous viral surface protein, e.g., the EBOV GP [55] . Garbutt and colleagues described the generation of rVSV vectors replacing VSV G with either EBOV Mayinga GP, or MARV Musoke GP, or Lassa virus (LASV) Josiah glycoprotein [57] . The VSV-EBOV vector has been termed VSVDG-EBOVgp, VSV/ZEBOV-GP or similar. For the rest of this manuscript, we will refer to them as VSV-EBOV, VSV-MARV, and VSV-LASV.",

Phase I and II clinical trials took place worldwide and yielded promising immunogenicity results, despite some concerning side-effects with high-dose vaccinations in particularly one cohort (reviewed in [3] ). However, the most encouraging news resulted from a Phase III clinical trial in Guinea where the VSV-EBOV was used in a ring vaccination strategy to stop EBOV transmission and control the epidemic. This study showed that the VSV-EBOV is indeed a fast-acting vaccine and showed 100% efficacy after 10 days of vaccination with no new cases occurring after that time in the cohort [67, 68] . This is very encouraging data underlining the great potential of this vaccine for emergency use.

While several experimental vaccine approaches have been tested for EBOV and, to a lesser extent, for MARV ( Fig. 1) , almost no progress has been made towards clinical trials. Taking into consideration that filoviruses can only be handled in high containment facilities available in a few countries worldwide and that, until 2014, they had not caused more than a few thousand human fatalities, there was never enough commercial interest or funding available for the development of licensed countermeasures. The situation changed following the EBOV epidemic that devastated West Africa from 2013 to 2016-clinical trials for the most promising countermeasure approaches were accelerated and funding was made available for the licensure process. Almost one year after West Africa was declared free of human EBOV cases, the progress of countermeasure licensure continues to be slow, although promising data from a few phase I-III clinical trials have raised the hope that protocols can be established to at least allow the use of pre-IND vaccines and treatments in emergency outbreaks. Ideally, we should be better prepared to act quickly after an infectious disease outbreak starts by knowing the status of experimental or pre-IND countermeasure approaches that could be used in emergencies. The West African EBOV epidemic is one of the most devastating examples of a modern-day emerging infectious disease outbreak that, thanks to continual-albeit slow-progress in the development of vaccines and countermeasures, will hopefully never be repeated.",
