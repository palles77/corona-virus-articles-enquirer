Derm) cells. EHV-1 colocalized with caveolin in EBMECs and the infection was greatly reduced by the expression of a dominant negative form of equine caveolin-1 (ecavY14F), suggesting that EHV-1 enters EBMECs via caveolar endocytosis. EHV-1 entry into E. Derm cells was significantly reduced by ATP depletion and treatments with lysosomotropic agents. Enveloped virions were detected from E. Derm cells by infectious virus recovery assay after viral internalization, suggesting that EHV-1 enters E. Derm cells via energy-and pH-dependent endocytosis. These results suggest that EHV-1 utilizes multiple endocytic pathways in different cell types to establish productive infection.",

Agents that perturb endocytosis were found to have little or no effect on herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in HEp-2 and Vero cells (Wittels and Spear, 1991) . Furthermore, entry of HSV-1 via endocytic vesicles was shown to result in degradation of the virus particles (Campadelli-Fiume et al., 1988) . However, it has recently become clear that HSV successfully infects HeLa, receptor-expressing CHO, and C10 murine melanoma cells as well as primary and transformed human epidermal keratinocytes via endocytosis (Nicola et al., 2003 Nicola and Straus, 2004; Milne et al., 2005) . The cellular and viral requirements for the endocytic entry of HSV into these cells have been characterized. In HeLa and receptor-expressing CHO cells, infectious entry of HSV requires trafficking of the virus to an acidic intracellular compartment, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity, glycoprotein D (gD) receptors, as well as viral gB, gD, and gH-gL (Nicola et al., 2003; Nicola and Straus, 2004) . The pathway into C10 murine melanoma cells is gD receptor dependent but independent of vesicles with a low pH (Milne et al., 2005) . HSV enters primary and transformed human epidermal keratinocytes, an important target cell population in vivo, by a pH-and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent mechanism .",

Similar ultrastructural observations were described for EHV-1 endocytosis in mouse fibroblast L-M cells (Abodeely et al., 1970) . Frampton et al. (2007) demonstrated that EHV-1 strain L11\u0394gI\u0394gE, which lacks gI and gE, enters CHO-K1 cells by endocytosis, while entry pathway into equine dermis (E. Derm) cells and rabbit kidney (RK13) cells is direct fusion of viral envelope with the plasma membrane. van de Walle et al. (2008) reported that integrin on the surface of the host cells is involved in the endocytosis of EHV-1. It has remained unclear, however, whether the other strains of EHV-1 utilize endocytosis to enter the susceptible cells.",

Here, we further examined the mode of EHV-1 entry into EBMECs and E. Derm cells using electron microscopy. At 10 min post infection (p.i.), enveloped virions were detected in noncoated vesicles within the cytoplasm of EBMECs ( Fig. 2A , Hasebe et al., 2006) and E. Derm cells (Figs. 2B, C). These observations imply that EHV-1 enters E. Derm cells as well as EBMECs via endocytosis. We were unable to quantify the numbers of enveloped viral particles in the endosomes, because we could not catch enough particles having the complete recognizable structure (i.e. core, capsid and envelope) for the quantification.",

            "text": "Clathrin-dependent endocytosis plays a major role in the entry of many viruses, having been classically described for Semliki Forest virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and influenza virus (Helenius et al., 1980; Matlin et al., 1981 Matlin et al., , 1982 . Although the vesicles containing the virions appeared not to possess clathrin coats by electron microscopy ( Fig. 2 ; Hasebe et al., 2006) , these observations did not exclude the possible involvement of clathrin-dependent endocytosis in EHV-1 entry. We therefore examined the EHV-1-infected cells by two-color immunofluorescence staining for EHV-1 and clathrin-heavy chain at 10 or 30 min p.i. Both in infected EBMECs (Figs. 3A-F) and E. Derm cells (Figs. 3G-L), EHV-1 immunoreactivity did not colocalize with clathrin at any time points. Lack of cross reactivity of anti-EHV-1 antibodies with anti-clathrin antibody was confirmed by the double staining of uninfected EBMECs and E. Derm cells (data not shown). The specificity of the mouse monoclonal antibody to clathrin-heavy chain in EBMECs and E. Derm cells was examined by Western blotting, in which the antibody detected the specific band at 180 kDa (data not shown). Localization of EHV-1 and caveolae during viral internalization Caveolar endocytosis has emerged as a route of entry for several viruses including simian virus 40 (SV40) (Anderson et al., 1996) , mouse polyomavirus (Richterov\u00e1 et al., 2001; Gilbert et al., 2003; Gilbert and Benjamin, 2004) , echovirus (Marjom\u00e4ki et al., 2002) , human papillomavirus type 31 (Bousarghin et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2007) , human polyomavirus BK (BKV) (Eash et al., 2004) , and species C human adenovirus (Colin et al., 2005) . So we next examined the possible association of caveolae with EHV-1 during viral internalization. Two-color immunostaining revealed that EHV-1 gB and caveolin, the major component of caveolae, were colocalized in EBMECs at 10 (Figs. 4A-C) and 30 min p.i. (Figs. 4D-F). Three fields were chosen at random and more than 50 signals for EHV-1 immunoreactivity were counted. Approximately 40% of the EHV-1 signal in EBMECs was colocalized with caveolin at 10 min p.i. The percentage of colocalization was reduced to 19% at 30 min p.i. Such colocalization was not detected in infected E. Derm cells at any time points (Figs. 4G-L). Lack of cross reactivity of anti-EHV-1 antibody with anti-caveolin antibodies was confirmed by the double staining of uninfected EBMECs and E. Derm cells (data not shown). The specificity of the rabbit polyclonal antibodies to caveolin in EBMECs and E. Derm cells was examined by Western blotting, in which the antibodies detected the specific bands at 24 kDa for alpha isoform and/or 21 kDa for beta isoform (data not shown).",

To confirm the involvement of caveolae vesicles in EHV-1 entry into EBMECs, we constructed equine caveolin-1 mutant. This mutant encodes a protein in which tyrosine 14 is mutated to phenylalanine (ecavY14F). This mutant has been known to act as a dominant negative inhibitor of caveolin-1 (Orlichenko et al., 2006) . The ecavY14F construct and wild type equine caveolin-1 (WT ecav) were expressed in EBMECs and E. Derm cells using a lentivirus vector. Cells expressing either WT ecav or ecavY14F were infected with EHV-1 strain Ab4-GFP (Ab4-GFP). The Ab4-GFP harbors a GFP expression cassette between gene 62 and gene 63 (Ibrahim et al., 2004) . Therefore, the viral infected cells show GFP signal. Fewer EHV-1infected EBMECs were observed in cells expressing ecavY14F than in cells expressing WT ecav (p b 0.01). However, there was no difference in the number of the EHV-1-infected E. Derm cells expressing ecavY14F or WT ecav (Figs. 5A, B). Expression of WT ecav and ecavY14F was confirmed by Western blotting with rabbit anticaveolin polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 5C ).",

Intracellular low pH is involved in BKV entry by caveolae-dependent endocytosis (Eash et al., 2004) although SV40 infection by caveolar endocytosis is pH independent (Ashok and Atwood, 2003) . To determine whether an acidic compartment is required for EHV-1 infectivity, we examined the effects of lysosomotropic agents on EHV-1 ICP0 RNA production. Cells were treated with bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride to neutralize the pH of acidic organelles (Tsiang and Superti, 1984; van Weert et al., 1995; Dr\u00f6se and Altendorf, 1997) and infected with EHV-1 in the continued presence of the reagent. The abundance of ICP0 RNA in E. Derm cells was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by treatment with bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 7A ) and ammonium chloride (Fig. 7B ). On the other hand, EHV-1 entry into EBMECs was not inhibited by bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 7A) and ammonium chloride at 10 mM (Fig. 7B ). The effect of ammonium chloride at 20 mM in EBMECs was not determined, because the expression of horse GAPDH was significantly reduced (p b 0.01; data not shown) suggesting that 20 mM of ammonium chloride is toxic in EBMECs. A fluorescent pH indicator probe, LysoSensor\u2122 Yellow/Blue DND-160, was used to confirm that the pH of the organelles was neutralized. This probe exhibits a pH-dependent increase in fluorescence intensity upon acidification when the cells are excited at 405 nm and the fluorescence is emitted at 490 nm. Untreated EBMECs and E. Derm cells exhibited punctuate staining. The staining of LysoSensor was diminished in EBMECs by the treatment with 0.2 \u03bcM of bafilomycin A1 and with 10 mM of ammonium chloride (Figs. 7C, D) . In E. Derm cells, signals of LysoSensor were diminished by the treatment with 1 \u03bcM of bafilomycin A1 and 20 mM of ammonium chloride (Figs. 7C, D). The concentration of bafilomycin A1 and ammonium chloride used here seemed to be non-toxic, because neither the morphology of both cell types nor the level of expression of GAPDH was affected (data not shown).",

            "text": "Effects of ATP depletion on EHV-1 entry into E. Derm cells EM studies and the effects of lysosomotropic agents suggest the possibility that EHV-1 enters E. Derm cells via endocytosis. However, these data are insufficient to demonstrate that endocytosis is involved in EHV-1 entry into E. Derm cells. To assess this possibility, we examined the effect of ATP depletion on EHV-1 infection to E. Derm cells. ATP depletion is known to inhibit endocytosis, but has no effect on herpesvirus entry by direct fusion of viral envelopes with plasma membranes (Nicola et al., 2003) . E. Derm cells were pretreated with glucose-free media containing 2-deoxy-D-glucose for 1 h, and then infected with Ab4-GFP for 1 h in the continued presence of glucosefree media. After virus infection, the media were replaced with complete growth media. To confirm that ATP depletion affects the viral entry step, the cells were infected with EHV-1 with media including glucose for 1 h, and then cultured with glucose-free media for 2 h. The number of infected cells was later evaluated by counting GFP-positive cells at 12 h p.i. ATP depletion during viral entry greatly reduced EHV-1 infection (P b 0.001) whereas ATP depletion post viral entry did not significantly reduce EHV-1 infection (Fig. 8) . Frampton et al. (2007) performed infectious virus recovery assays to demonstrate that EHV-1 L11\u0394gI\u0394gE strain enters CHO-K1 cells via endocytosis. Since endocytosed virions possess envelopes in the early phase of entry, infectivity can be detected by titration on RK13 cells. On the other hand, when virus penetrates by direct fusion of envelope with plasma membrane, infectious virions cannot be detected due to the loss of the viral envelope. To confirm that EHV-1 enters E. Derm cells via endocytosis, we performed infectious virus recovery assay. After incubation at 4\u00b0C for 5 min, the cells were infected with EHV-1 at an m.o.i. of 10 p.f.u. per cell for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. The temperature was then shifted to 37\u00b0C to allow the virus internalization. At 0, 7.5, 15, 30 and 45 min after the temperature shift, the viruses on the cell surface were inactivated by washing with acidic buffer. The internalized infectious viruses were titrated on RK13 cells. For a control to eliminate the possibility of detecting virions remaining on the cell surface, we used NIH3T3 cells, which seem to be resistant to EHV-1 entry because we could not detect viral RNA at 12 h p.i. by RT-PCR (data not shown). At 0 and 7.5 min, no infectious virus was detected from E. Derm and NIH3T3 cells. At 15 min, virus was recovered from E. Derm cells. The virus titer from E. Derm cells reached a peak at 30 min and slightly declined at 45 min. In contrast, no virus was recovered from NIH3T3 cells at any time point (Fig. 9 ).",

However, recent studies have shown that this traditional description of caveolar morphology is inadequate, as caveolae with flat or tubular forms have also been detected (Anderson, 1998) . Caveolae-dependent endocytosis has also been found to contribute to the entry of enveloped viruses, such as filoviruses and human coronavirus (Empig and Goldsmith, 2002; Nomura et al., 2004) .

Recently, caveolin-1-positive endosomes have been shown to deliver caveolae-internalized cargo to the Golgi complex (Nichols, 2003) and BKV enters Vero cells via this pathway (Eash et al., 2004) . The effects of the lysosomotropic agent used in this study suggest that acidic intracellular organelles do not facilitate EHV-1 infection in EBMECs. Therefore, EHV-1 may be transported to pHneutral organelles after internalization via caveolae.",

Such a route might be operative in vivo for EHV-1 infection of certain cell types, such as lymphocytes, that do not appear to form caveolae. The principal pathway of EHV-1 entry into E.

            "text": "Despite the lack of colocalization of EHV-1 with endocytic markers, our data from electron microscopy, lysosomotropic agent treatment, energy depletions and infectious virus recovery assays suggest that EHV-1 enters E. Derm cells via energy-and pH-dependent endocytosis. In contrast, Frampton et al. (2007) suggested that EHV-1 strain L11\u0394gI\u0394gE entry into E. Derm cells occurs by direct fusion at the cell surface. The difference between Frampton's study and our own could be explained by the difference in virus strain. The strain L11\u0394gI\u0394gE is a mutant which lacks gI and gE, resulting in attenuated virulence in mice and reduction of viral growth on RK13 cells compared to the parental virus strain RacL11 (Frampton et al., 2002) . It has been thought that gE of varicella zoster virus (VZV), another Varicellovirus, is associated with viral entry. Notably, Li et al. (2006) reported that gE interacts with insulin-degrading enzyme, which acts as a cellular receptor mediating cell-free VZV infection and cell-to-cell spread. Therefore, the lack of gE might influence the EHV-1 entry mechanism. The dependence of entry mechanisms on virus strain has been reported for human papillomavirus by Bousarghin et al. (2003) , who demonstrated that although they are very closely related viruses human papillomavirus types 16, 31 and 58 use different pathways to enter cells.",
