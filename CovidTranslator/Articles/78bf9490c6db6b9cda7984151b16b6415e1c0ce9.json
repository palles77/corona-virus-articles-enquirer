The interaction between SARS coronavirus 3C-like (3CL) proteinase and an octapeptide interface inhibitor was studied by affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). The binding constants were estimated by the change of migration time of the analytes in the buffer solution containing different concentrations of SARS 3CL proteinase. The results showed that SARS 3CL proteinase was able to complex with the octapeptide competitively, with binding constants of 2.44 \u00b7 10 4 M \u00c01 at 20\u00b0C and 2.11 \u00b7 10 4 M \u00c01 at 37\u00b0C. In addition, the thermodynamic parameters deduced reveal that hydrophobic interaction might play major roles, along with electrostatic force, in the binding process. The ACE method used here could be developed to be an effective and simple way of applying large-scale drug screening and evaluation.",

Then the sequence of the complete genome of this novel human coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was determined. It contained 29,727 nucleotides in length and 11 open reading frames, with a genome organization similar to that of other known coronaviruses, including two human coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. The phylogenetic analysis and sequence comparisons indicated that SARS-CoV was not closely related to any of the three previously known groups of characterized coronaviruses [4, 5] . The SARS-CoV main proteinase (33.8 kDa), also called the 3C-like (3CL) proteinase, was essential for the life cycle of SARS-CoV, playing a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription functions through extensive proteolytic processing of two replicase polyproteins: pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa) [6, 7] .",

Hilgenfeld\u00d5s group determined the crystal structures of human coronavirus (strain 229E) main proteinase and a substrate analogue hexapeptidyl chloromethyl ketone (CMK) inhibitor complex of porcine coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus, TGEV) main proteinase. The results revealed a remarkable degree of conservation of the substrate-binding site, and a homology model for SARS-CoV main proteinase was constructed [6] . The crystal structures of the SARS-CoV main proteinase at different pH values and binding to a specific inhibitor with a covalent-bonded substrate analogue were reported by Rao\u00d5s group, providing insights to the substrate binding site and a structural basis for rational drug design [7] . The virtual screening tested by Xiong et al. [8] indicated that 73 available proteinase inhibitors in the MDDR database might dock into both the binding pockets of the TGEV main proteinase and the SARS-CoV 3CL proteinase. A series of cell-based assays with SARS virus and Vero E6 cells, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry assays, were applied and reported by Wu et al. [9] to screen existing drugs, natural products, and synthetic compounds to identify effective anti-SARS agents, with the results showing that approximately 50 compounds were active at 10 lM and that 7 compounds were active at 3 lM. Based on the atomic coordinates of the SARS-CoV main proteinase, research was conducted by Chou\u00d5s group on KZ7088 (a derivative of AG7088) and the AVLQSGFR octapeptide to the enzyme, which were interacting with the active site of the SARS enzyme through six hydrogen bonds, with KZ7088 having a clear definition of the binding pocket [10] . Kuo et al. [11] prepared a peptide with fluorescence quenching pair (Dabcyl and Edans) at both ends of a peptide substrate and used this fluorogenic peptide substrate to characterize the SARS main proteinase and screen inhibitors.",

One company, Cetek, has developed and optimized the CE Assay, an advanced CE assay for high information binding [15, 16] . The weak bindings (K b = 10 3 -10 4 M \u00c01 ) of macromolecules and small ligands can be detected easily by affinity capillary electrophoresis (ACE). Another advantage of the ACE method is that all of the interacting components can be studied in solution, thereby eliminating the possibility of denaturation of conformational alteration of the biomacromolecules such as protein and nucleic acid [12] . Various affinity interactions, such as drug-protein, pro-tein-protein, protein-nucleic acid, protein-carbohydrate, peptide-antibiotic, enzyme-cofactors, lectinsugar, antigen-antibody, and cyclodextrins (CDs)-enantiomer, have been investigated by ACE during recent years [17, 18] .",

Inhibitors targeting the dimeric interface should be a new strategy to control the activity of SARS 3CL proteinase. Because one monomer of SARS 3CL proteinase binds to the other, specifically at the N-terminal interface [6, 7] , to compete with the dimeric interaction of the proteinase, an octapeptide interface inhibitor was designed according to the amino acid sequence of the N terminus of SARS 3CL proteinase. In the current study, a simple and effective CE method with very low sample consumption was developed and applied to study the interaction between SARS 3CL proteinase and the octapeptide interface inhibitor. The binding constants were measured by the changes in the migration time of the octapeptide inhibitor at different concentrations of SARS 3CL proteinase in the running buffer solutions. The octapeptide was found to bind to SARS 3CL proteinase specifically and competitively. Thermodynamic analysis indicates that hydrophobic interactions play a major role, along with electrostatic force, in the binding processes.",

In addition, one monomer of SARS 3CL proteinase binds to the other one specifically at the N-terminal interface [19, 23] . To compete with the dimeric interaction of the proteinase, the octapeptide inhibitor was designed according to the amino acid sequence of the N terminus of SARS 3CL proteinase. Because the concentrations of SARS 3CL proteinase were less than 0.2 mg ml \u00c01 in the current experimental conditions, the main form of the proteinase was thought to be monomer. The binding constant of the octapeptide with SARS 3CL proteinase was measured to be 2.44 \u00b7 10 4 M \u00c01 at 20\u00b0C, and the dissociation constant of the dimer of the proteinase was estimated to be 100 lM [19] ; thus, the octapeptide inhibitor can bind to the monomer of the proteinase competitively and can prevent the dimerization effectively. Moreover, the interactions between the octapeptide and the two common proteins, BSA and OVA, were studied as a negative control at the same conditions to avoid the influence of nonspecific absorption. Compared with Fig. 2 , the plots of BSA were similar (Fig. 3A) , with the binding constants being calculated as 8.01 \u00b7 10 3 M \u00c01 at 20\u00b0C and 8.20 \u00b7 10 3 M \u00c01 at 37\u00b0C, whereas the plots of OVA were random (Fig. 3B) .
