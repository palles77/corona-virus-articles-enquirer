The COVID-19 outbreak has been declared as a pandemic and is expected to cause one of the most serious global public health problems in recent years 1 In this study, based on the public data of COVID-19 cases, we predicted the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in China and across the world. We first built the prediction model using the publicly available data for COVID cases. These data included the daily numbers of cumulative confirmed cases (CCCs), new cases (NCs), and death cases (DCs) of COVID-19 in China since January 20, 2020. We trained our model using the data from Jan 20, 2020, to Mar 1, 2020, and predicted the daily numbers of CCCs, NCs, and DCs after Mar 1, 2020. Furthermore, we predicted the epidemic trend of COVID-19 across the world (outside China) using the models derived from the models built based on the China cases.",

Because the COVID-19 outbreak outside China is in the initial or exponential expansion phase depending on different regions or countries, currently it is difficult to predict the major turning points in the COVID-19 epidemic outside China based on their data. Therefore, we assumed that the COVID-19 outbreak outside China follows a similar pattern to that in China, and accordingly derived predictive models for the COVID-19 epidemic outside China from the models built based on the China cases. Our models predicted that the COVID-19 outbreak will peak across the world around April 10, 2020, and is basically under control in mid-June (Table 1) . It should be noted that these predictions are made under the premise that the countries outside China implement comprehensive and stringent control measures like China, such as city lockdown, traffic control, and concentrated medical support for seriously-infected areas. Otherwise, the epidemic outside China could follow a different trend from China, e.g., prolonged outbreak that results in more unnecessary deaths and cases.",

Thus, an accurate prediction of the epidemic trend of COVID-19 may provide valuable advice on how to effectively prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 to relieve the major social and economic impacts of this disease. Although a number of studies have estimated the epidemic trend of the COVID-19 outbreak, most of these studies have used the early stage data and focused on the cases in China 2-8 . For example, using the SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Removed) model, Wang et al. estimated the numbers of COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, China under the conditions of insufficient and sufficient control measures being taken, respectively 3 . Wu et al. predicted the domestic and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 based on travel volume data during Dec, 2019, and Jan, 2020 4 . Chen et al. evaluated the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 using the reservoir-people transmission network model 7 . Yang et al. predicted the epidemic peaks and scales of COVID-19 using the SEIR model and machine learning approach to show the indispensability of the nationwide interventions starting from Jan 23, 2020 8 . With COVID-19 remaining active in China and continuing to spread around the world, predicting the COVID-19 epidemic trend in China and across the world based on the updated data is definitely needed.",
