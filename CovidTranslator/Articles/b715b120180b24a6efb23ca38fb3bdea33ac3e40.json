A modified VTT (MVTT 2-GFP ) was constructed by replacing the viral M1L-K2L genes with a GFP gene. In comparison to the parental VTT, MVTT 2-GFP lost its replication capacity in rabbit RK13 and human HeLa cell lines. The life cycle of viral replication was blocked at different stages in these two cell lines as determined by electron microscope examination. MVTT 2-GFP was less virulent than VTT for 100-fold by measuring mouse body weight loss after intranasal viral inoculation and for 340-fold by determining the intracranial LD 50 value in mice. The foreign GFP gene was stable genetically after 10 rounds of passage in Vero cells. Importantly, MVTT 2-GFP elicited both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to the GFP gene in mice. With two intramuscular inoculations of 10 5 PFU virus, the anti-GFP antibody reciprocal endpoint titer reached over 700 as determined by an ELISA. The number of IFN-\u2425 secreting T cells reached over 350 SFU per million splenocytes against a CD8+ T cell-specific epitope of GFP. Collectively, the removal of the M1L-K2L genes is a useful method to generate an attenuated vaccinia Tian Tan vaccine vector.",

The full-length sequence of the VTT genome was determined by Jin et al. (1997) . Based on sequence comparison, VTT displays genetic features distinct from other vaccinia viruses including the vaccinia western reserve (WR) strain (Hou et al., 1985; Jin et al., 1997; Tsao et al., 1986) . In particular, unique deletions or insertions, which affect multiple genes, were identified in the restriction enzyme HindIII-C, B and A fragments. These data infer the plausibly distinct biological properties of VTT (Jin et al., 1997) . Recently, the biological properties of VTT were characterized in terms of its host cell range and growth properties in vitro and virulence in vivo (Fang et al., 2005) . Although VTT is significantly less virulent than the vaccinia WR strain, it remains lethal in mice after intracranial inoculation and causes significant body weight loss after intranasal inoculation (Fang et al., 2005) . These properties have limited its use as a vaccine vector for human use, especially for immune-suppressed individuals. Therefore, further attenuation of VTT is necessary for the development of a useful vaccine vector.",

The poxvirus vector is the live recombinant vector which has been studied most intensively. The widely studied vaccinia-based vector is probably the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA). This vector is safe in humans, even in some immunocompromised individuals (Cosma et al., 2003) . Moreover, MVA-based vaccines are effective for inducing protective responses against different viruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (Bisht et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005; De Waal et al., 2004; Degano et al., 1999; Olszewska et al., 2004; Sutter et al., 1994; Wyatt et al., 1999) . MVA-based vaccines are also effective in delaying the development of AIDS and the progression of the disease in rhesus monkeys infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) or simian/human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) (Barouch et al., 2001) . However, the immunogenicity profile of MVA as a vaccine vector for HIV-1 is unsatisfactory in humans. A recent phase one trial indicated that an MVA-based HIV-1 vaccine is not very immunogenic in humans (Goonetilleke et al., 2006) . It is, therefore, desirable to explore the potential of other vaccinia-based vector systems for stimulating stronger host immune responses in humans.",

This method involves the genetic modification of the parental VTT genome by deleting the M1L-K2L genes including one host range gene, K1L. The rationale for choosing these genes for deletion corresponds to the lost genes for the deletion II region of MVA genome (Antoine et al., 1998; Meyer et al., 1991) . Before this study, it was unknown to what extent a vaccinia virus could be attenuated just by removing the M1L-K2L genes. As the deletion II region of MVA serves as an ideal insertion site for foreign genes, the effectiveness of the corresponding region in the VTT genome for the expression of a foreign gene was also unknown. For these reasons, the phenotypic changes of MVTT 2-GFP in comparison to the parental VTT both in vitro and in vivo, and the potential use of MVTT 2-GFP as a live viral vector for vaccine development were examined in this study.",

Thirteen mammalian cell lines of various host origin and primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEF) were infected with MVTT 2-GFP at an MOI of 0.05. These cell lines included COS-7, WISH, BHK-21, MRC-5, CHO-K1, HeLa, 293T, RK(15), MDCK, RK13, C6, Vero and NIH/3T3. Since these cells were derived from diverse host and tissue origins, this experiment determined the breadth of the host cell range of MVTT 2-GFP . In comparison to the parental VTT, the replication property of MVTT 2-GFP did not change significantly in cell lines including COS-7, Vero, WISH, BHK-21, MRC-5, CHO-K1, NIH/3T3 and CEF. For example, MVTT 2-GFP replicates well in Vero cells (Fig. 1 ). However, the replication level of MVTT 2-GFP dropped more than 6-10-fold in cell lines including MDCK, C6, RK13, PK(15), 293T and HeLa ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ). In particular, MVTT 2-GFP did not seem to replicate in RK13 and HeLa cells overtime.

The infection was indicated by the expression of specific antigens stained with a polyclonal anti-vaccinia serum in infected cells (Fig. 2) . When compared with the parental VTT strain, the MVTT 2-GFP spread well in cell lines including COS-7, Vero, WISH, BHK-21, MRC-5, NIH/3T3 and CEF. MVTT 2-GFP , however, displayed restricted spread in several cell lines including MDCK, C6 and 293T (Fig. 2) . The fewer number of positive cells found in each foci at 48 h p.i. indicates that the viral spread via cellto-cell contact was less efficient.

As controls, both cell lines produced the majority of the viral particles with characteristic brick-shape of IMV in their cytoplasm after they were infected with the parental VTT ( Fig. 3C and D) .

Although mice infected with MVTT 2-GFP showed less than 10% of weight loss over 7 days in the high dose group (10 6 PFU), the virus is significantly less virulent than the parental VTT, which resulted in about 30% weight loss during the same period of time (Fang et al., 2005) . Interestingly, the body weight change in mice infected with 10 6 PFU of MVTT 2-GFP was similar to that of mice that were given 10 4 PFU of parental VTT (Fig. 4) .

First, MVTT 2-GFP displayed a reduced replication capacity in two human cell lines, HeLa and 293T, as well as in animal cell lines including PK(15), RK13, C6 and MDCK. These phenotypic changes were found to be likely related to the reduced replication and cell-to-cell spread capacity of MVTT 2-GFP . The RK13 and HeLa cell lines became non-permissive to MVTT 2-GFP infection. The EM examination indicated that the life cycle of MVTT 2-GFP was significantly blocked at a relatively early stage before the assembly of immature virions in RK13 cells but at a stage of virion maturation in HeLa cells. Second, MVTT 2-GFP is much less virulent as determined by two separated experiments. About 10% body weight loss was found at day 7 p.i. in mice that received the high dose (10 6 PFU) of MVTT 2-GFP via the intranasal route of inoculation. Since 10 4 PFU of the parental VTT caused a similar level of body weight loss, MVTT 2-GFP was likely attenuated by about 100-fold. Moreover, MVTT 2-GFP displayed an increase of intracranial LD 50 in mice via the intracranial inoculation that was 340 times greater than the parental VTT. These findings indicate that MVTT 2-GFP is an attenuated vaccinia strain. This attenuation is essential for its future development as a safe vaccine vector (Lee et al., 1992; Moss, 1996; Tartaglia et al., 1992) . This attenuation, however, does not seem to affect the expression of the foreign antigens GFP in various cell types infected individually. This property is a prerequisite for a vaccinia-based vaccine vector. The GFP gene in MVTT 2-GFP may serve either as a reverse selection marker for vaccine construction or as a reporter in a neutralization assay.",

            "text": "The phenotypic changes observed in MVTT 2-GFP are related to the loss of the M1L-K2L genes in the VTT genome. Previous studies revealed that VTT displays genetic features distinct from other vaccinia viruses (Hou et al., 1985; Tsao et al., 1986) . These genetic features led to distinct biological characteristics of VTT when compared to vaccinia WR strain (Fang et al., 2005) . In this study, four vaccinia genes including three early genes, M1L, M2L and K1L, as well as one intermediate gene, K2L were removed from the VTT genome to generate MVTT 2-GFP . These four genes have not been found associated with the virulence of a vaccinia virus in vivo before. Of them, K1L is a previously defined host range gene that is essential for vaccinia viral replication in RK13 cells (Chung et al., 1997; Perkus et al., 1990; Ramsey-Ewing and Moss, 1996) . Consistent with previous findings for VVdelK1L and MVA, MVTT 2-GFP replicated poorly also in RK13 cells. Since the K1L gene inhibits the apoptosis of RK13 cells and host NF-kappaB activation (Shisler and Jin, 2004) , a separate study is necessary to address whether or not the K1L gene of VTT alone would have similar biological functions. The K2L gene encodes a serine protease inhibitor which inhibits cell-cell fusion (Law and Smith, 1992; Turner and Moyer, 1995; Zhou et al., 1992) . The deletion of K2L alone did not change virus replication in vitro as well as the virulence and immunogenicity in vivo (Law and Smith, 1992; Turner and Moyer, 1995; Zhou et al., 1992) . The loss of K2L gene in MVTT 2-GFP does not induce cell-cell fusion in every cell type tested (Fig. 3) . Consistent with previous findings, the property of enhanced cell fusion does not increase the virulence of MVTT 2-GFP in vivo because the virus was attenuated instead. To date, the biological functions of vaccinia M1L and M2L genes remain not clear. M1L was suggested previously to function as an ankyrin-like protein (Shchelkunov et al., 1993) . At this stage, although the loss of M1L-K2L genes has resulted in the formation of an attenuated MVTT 2-GFP , whether or not each of the four genes has contributed to the phenotypic changes remains exclusive. Further analysis of each individual gene is required to obtain a definitive answer. Nevertheless, the loss of the M1L-K2L genes does not affect the replication of MVTT 2-GFP in Vero and CEF cells. Since other attenuated viruses (e.g. MVA) rely solely on CEF cells for production, the growth property of MVTT 2-GFP in Vero cells may offer an advantage for future manufacture because Vero is one of the WHO and FDA approved cell lines for vaccine production. As for the development of a human vaccine vector, it is anticipated that the further inactivation of additional VTT genes involved in host cell range (e.g. C7L) and in viral virulence (e.g. hemagglutinin, TK, etc.) would be necessary (Antoine et al., 1996; Shida et al., 1988) .",

            "text": "MVTT 2-GFP elicits specific immune response against the foreign antigen GFP. To use an attenuated vaccinia virus as a live vaccine vector, one critical question is whether or not this virus is still immunogenic for inducing specific immune response against foreign antigens. To address this question, the immune response against the vector and foreign antigen was determined. With a suboptimal dose of 10 5 PFU, MVTT 2-GFP and VTT induced similar levels of neutralizing antibody responses to VTT (Fig. 7) . GFP-specific humoral and cell-mediated immune responses were detected. The levels of these responses are comparable to those induced by a VTT GFP virus. Since GFP is apparently stable in the genome of MVTT 2-GFP , this virus can be developed further to become a live vaccine vector for infectious pathogens or tumors. In this case, the genes encoding the pathogen or tumor specific antigens can be placed in the genomic location of the GFP gene. In future studies, a comparative study using MVTT 2-GFP and other vaccinia strains (e.g. MVA) is essential to reveal the fundamental differences or advantages of these systems to serve as vaccine vectors. Considering that MVTT 2-GFP remains replication-competent in several mammalian cells tested, a correlation between dosing and vaccine efficacy needs to be evaluated, as would the non-invasive mucosal routes of vaccination. The latter is critical because the inoculation of vaccinia-based vaccine via mucosal route can induce immune response against foreign genes even in the presence of preexisting anti-vector immunity (Belyakov et al., 1999) . It was demonstrated that mucosal inoculation of vacciniaimmune BALB/c mice with recombinant vaccinia expressing HIV-1 gp160 induced specific serum antibody and strong HIV-1specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses. For live viral vaccine vectors, it is essential to evade the preexisting anti-vector immu-nity and to stimulate robust immune responses at the site of viral transmission (e.g. influenza and HIV-1). For individuals who did not receive smallpox vaccination (born after 1980), the preexisting anti-vector immunity is not an issue.",
