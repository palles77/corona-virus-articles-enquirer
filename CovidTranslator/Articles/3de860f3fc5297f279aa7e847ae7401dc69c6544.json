Of the three enveloped viruses tested, human herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus type 3 and porcine respiratory corona virus, only HSV-1 proved sensitive to the 3-HP-proteins. All of the chemically modified proteins presented antiviral activity against HSV-1 when assayed before, during or after infection. However, to achieve HSV-1 inhibition, significantly higher concentrations of the modified proteins were required if present before infection as compared to during or after infection. Our results suggest that multiple mechanisms are involved in the inhibition of HSV-1 infection. Proteolytical digestion of albumin, \u2423-lactalbumin, \u2424-lactoglobulin and lysozyme by trypsin, chymotrypsin and pepsin yielded several peptide fragments with antiherpetic activity. Chemical modification of these peptide fragments by 3-HP generated peptides with antiviral activity, however, this was almost always combined with a cytotoxic effect on the Vero cells. Overall, our results suggest that targeted chemical modification of some natural products might provide compounds effective against HSV-1 infection.",

The introduction of negative charges into human serum albumin by chemical modification with polysaccharides, formaldehyde and aliphatic anhydrides yielded compounds with antiviral activity against HIV-1 (Jansen et al., 1991 (Jansen et al., , 1993 Takami et al., 1992; Kuipers et al., 1996 Kuipers et al., , 1999 Swart et al., 1996 Swart et al., , 1999 . However, in a systematic study, Neurath et al. (1995) demonstrated aromatic anhydrides to be more effective in the conversion of natural proteins into negatively charged antiviral agents against HIV-1. The cellular CD4-receptor of lymphocytes, macrophages and monocytes was found to be the primary target for this inhibition. \u2424-Lactoglobulin modified with 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride (3-HP) in higher concentrations, also binds to the HIV gp120 binding site on CD4 (Neurath et al., 1996) . Additionally, 3-HP-\u2424-lactoglobulin is active against HSV-1 and -2 (Neurath et al., 1998) and Chlamydia trachomatis .",

This might, on one hand, be due to the cell damage caused by viral multiplication that allows the compound to penetrate into the cell. Such a mechanism has been postulated for cystatin C, (Bj\u00f6rk et al., 1990) . On the other hand, the binding of the modified proteins to the viral envelope glycoproteins could be taken as a basis to explain an inhibition at the intercellular or extracellular level. In fact 3-HP-\u2424-lactoglobulin binds to the glycoprotein E (Neurath et al., 1998) , which mediates, together with gI, the direct cell-to-cell transmission of HSV-1 (Dingwell et al., 1994; Weeks et al., 1997) . The blockage of gE would inhibit the viral spread on the intercellular level. The binding of the modified proteins to glycoproteins gB, gC and/or gD of the virions, which are released from cells after a first replication cycle, could give an explanation for an extracellular inhibition.",

We, therefore, wanted to know whether the chemical modification of the lysine residues by 3-HP would lead to an increase in the antiviral activity of peptide fragments generated by proteolytic digestion. 3-HP-proteins and 3-HP-peptides are instable and precipitate at an acidic pH. This makes their purification by reversed phase chromatography impossible, since this procedure is performed at an acidic pH. Thus, we decided to not directly digest the 3-HP-proteins, but to chemically modify peptide fragments present in the pools. Most of the 3-HP modified pools showed antiherpetic activity when present after the infection of the Vero cells and several of them were able to block the multiplication of the virus. However, all the 3-HP-pools examined were toxic for Vero cells to different extent. Since at the present stage of our research the single peptides of the pools with antiherpetic activity have not been isolated, it is not possible to say with certainty whether antiviral activity and toxic effects are due to the same molecule or to two separate entities.",
