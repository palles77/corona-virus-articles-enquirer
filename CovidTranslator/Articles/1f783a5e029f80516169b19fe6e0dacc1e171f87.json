ONT offers a 'third-generation', portable, real-time approach to generating long-read 77 sequence data, with demonstrated success across a range of viruses [21, [23] [24] [25] . To date, 78 Nanopore sequencing of influenza has been reported using high titre virus from an in vitro 79 culture system, producing full length genome sequences through direct RNA sequencing [26] or 80 targeted enrichment by either hybridisation of cDNA [27] or influenza-specific PCR amplification 81 [28] . 82 83 We therefore aimed to optimise a metagenomic protocol for detecting influenza viruses directly 84 from clinical samples using Nanopore sequencing. We determine its sensitivity compared to 85 existing diagnostic methods and its accuracy compared to short-read (Illumina) sequencing, 86 using clinical samples from hospital patients during an influenza season, and samples from a 87 laboratory controlled infection in ferrets. 88",

The approach demonstrates excellent specificity; sensitivity varies by viral titre, but 214 is comparable to existing laboratory diagnostic tests for Ct values <30. Our optimised protocol 215 depletes human and bacterial nucleic acids, and reduces the time from sample to sequence. 216This method has the potential to be further optimised and validated to improve sensitivity for 217 influenza, identify other RNA viruses, detect drug-resistance mutations, and provide insights into 218 quasispecies diversity[31,32]. At a population level, this sequence-based diagnostic data can, 219 in addition, provide phylo-epidemiological reconstruction, insights into transmission events, 220 potential for estimating vaccine efficacy [33], and approaches for public health intervention[34]. 221 222 Whole genome viral sequencing can accurately trace outbreaks across time and space[35]. 223The metagenomic method employed here produced >90% complete genomes for 17/27 224 samples with a Ct value \u226430, demonstrating the ability of metagenomics to produce sufficient 225",

Careful optimisation of laboratory and 236 bioinformatic methods are required to resolve individual sequence polymorphisms, particularly 237 for drug resistance alleles. 238 239 IDSA guidelines[9] recommend nasal/nasopharyngeal specimens for influenza diagnosis, but 240 throat swabs are easier to collect in clinical practice and therefore accounted for the majority of 241 our diagnostic samples. Further work is needed to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of 242 our protocol for a wider array of respiratory sample types (also including bronchoalveolar 243 lavage, sputum and saliva), which may yield different degrees of contaminating bacterial and/or 244 human reads. Loss of assay sensitivity due to the presence of high-level background DNA from 245 either host or bacterial origin is a fundamental issue for metagenomic approaches, even in cell 246 free sample types such as cerebrospinal-fluid[36]. This challenge is exacerbated in throat 247 swabs, as seen in our data. Our use of hazara virus as an internal positive control allows us to 248 identify those sample in which sensitivity has dropped below 10 4 viral genome copies per ml. In 249 our test set 8% of samples showed insufficient sensitivity for hazara virus, however half of these 250 contained a high titre of influenza, so only 4% were true sensitivity failures. This figure is in line 251 higher Ct values in our clinical samples (Ct 30-40), the sensitivity of Nanopore 256 sequencing was reduced compared to the current PCR-based test (Cepheid). Further 257 optimisation will be required to maximise the diagnostic yield from this group of samples, between Ct value and Nanopore reads confirms semi-quantitative output. Using261 samples from the ferret influenza model, collected under standardized laboratory conditions, 262 demonstrated excellent reproducibility of viral read proportions at a given viral titre across 263 biological replicates. However, we observed heterogeneity in output between clinical samples 264 as well as between Nanopore flowcells, suggesting that the current platform is not yet 265 sufficiently reliable for reproducibly generating quantitative data. In addition, the detection of 266 positive controls can be impaired in high background samples also creating further uncontrolled 267 variability in the test yield. 268 269 Future application of this method will involve real-time laboratory testing of respiratory samples, 270 running the platform head-to-head with existing clinical diagnostics to further assess sensitivity 271 and specificity, and using influenza sequence data to investigate transmission events. 272 Identifying instances of nosocomial transmission may shed light on healthcare-acquired 273 infection, thus helping to improve infection control practice. Assessment of diversity within deep 274 sequence datasets provides an opportunity to investigate the relationship between within-host 275 polymorphisms and clinical outcomes. Long-read sequences confer the potential advantage of 276 identifying viral haplotypes and ascertaining the extent to which significant polymorphisms are 277 , our methods show promise for generating influenza virus sequences directly from 283 respiratory samples. The 'pathogen agnostic' metagenomic sequencing approach offers an 284 opportunity for simultaneous testing for a wide range of potential pathogens, providing a faster 285 route to optimum treatment and contributing to antimicrobial stewardship. Longer term, this 286 approach has promise as a routine laboratory test, providing data to inform treatment, vaccine 287 design and deployment, infection control policies, and surveillance. 288 Methods 289 Study cohort and sample collection 290 We collected respiratory samples from the clinical microbiology laboratory at Oxford University 291 Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, a large tertiary referral teaching hospital in the South East of 292 England.

            "text": "described workflow [21], based on the Round A/B methodology [24]. For reverse transcription, 355 4\u03bcl of RNA and 1\u03bcl of Primer A (5\u2032-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-N9-3\u2032, 40 pmol/\u03bcl) [24] were 356 mixed and incubated for 5min at 65\u00b0C, then cooled to room temperature. First strand synthesis 357 was performed by the addition of 2\u03bcl SuperScriptIV First-strand Buffer, 1\u03bcL 12.5mM dNTPs, 358 0.5\u03bcL 0.1 M DTT, 1\u03bcl H 2 O, and 0.5\u03bcL SuperScriptIV (ThermoFisher) before incubation for 359 10min at 42\u00b0C. Second strand synthesis was performed by addition of 1\u03bcl Sequenase Buffer, 360 3.85\u03bcl H 2 O and 0.15\u03bcl Sequenase (Affymetrix) prior to incubation for 8min at 37\u00b0C, followed by 361 addition of 0.45\u03bcl Sequenase Dilution Buffer, 0.15\u03bcl Sequenase and a further incubation at 362 37\u00b0C for 8min. Amplification of cDNA was performed in triplicate using 5\u03bcl of the reaction as 363 input to a 50\u03bcl AccuTaq LA reaction (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instructions, using 1\u03bcl 364 Primer B (5\u2032-GTTTCCCACTGGAGGATA-3\u2032 ) [24], with PCR cycling conditions of: 98\u00b0C for 30s; 365 30 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15s, 50\u00b0C for 20s, and 68\u00b0C for 2min, followed by 68\u00b0C for 10min. 366Amplified cDNA was pooled from the triplicate reactions and purified using a 1:1 ratio of AMPure 367 XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and quantified by Qubit High Sensitivity dsDNA kit 368 (Thermo Fisher), both according to manufacturer's instructions. 369 Multiplex sequencing libraries were prepared using 250ng of cDNA from up to 12 samples as 372 input to the SQK-LSK108 or SQK-LSK109 Kit, barcoded individually using the EXP-NBD103 373 Native barcodes (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) and a modified \"One-pot\" protocol (Quick 374 2018). Libraries were sequenced on FLO-MIN106 flow cells on the MinION Mk1b or GridION 375 device (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), with sequencing proceeding for 48h. Samples were 376 batched according to the GeneXpert Ct value (see supplementary data file 1). 377 Nextera XT V2 kit (Illumina) sequencing libraries were prepared using 1.5ng of amplified cDNA 380 as per manufacturer's instructions and sequenced on a 2x150 bp-paired end Illumina MiSeq 381 run, by Genomics Services Development Unit, Public Health England.
