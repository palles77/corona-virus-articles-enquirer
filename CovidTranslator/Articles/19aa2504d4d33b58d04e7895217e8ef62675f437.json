One of these, AB68 (XTL Biopharmaceuticals, Rehovot, existing medical needs for new therapies and provide sufficient on emerging pathogens such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, rabies, and SCV. Importantly, the emphasis has been on development of human mAbs, which, along with humanized products, comprise most of the commercial mAbs now in clinical study. Ties between the public and private sectors are notoriously intricate. [40] In fact, the preclinical mAbs for SCV and West Nile virus infections attributed here to the commercial sector were all developed with at least some input from the public sector. However, it remains to be seen whether mAbs for infections that occur at high levels only sporadically, or those that would be likely to provide poor return on investment, will be commercialized. MAbs could potentially be critical as a first response measure in the case of a public health crisis, but substantial public sector input might be required to get such products to the market. The NIH's current emphasis on translational medicine might ease the progress of less commercially attractive products through the process of preclinical and clinical development. Despite obstacles to the development of innovative mAbs for the prophylaxis or treatment of viral diseases, there is reason for return on investment. Opportunities of this type exist for numerous cautious optimism. Scientific advances have uncovered potential viral diseases for which (i) current treatment options are not new viral targets and mAb modes of action. New possibilities exist optimal; (ii) no effective vaccines are available; and (iii) markets, for designing safer and more efficacious mAbs.
