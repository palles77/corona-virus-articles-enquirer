This month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling on the public to \"Prepare for everywhere,\" by highlighting resources targeted to different realms of preparedness: family, neighborhood, workplace and school, and global. 1 Nurses are respected health professionals in the community, often recognized as an approachable resource for valid health information among friends and family members. Nurses can use this position to provide accurate medical information and advocate best practices. For example, in the case of airborne disease outbreaks, nurses can dispel misinformation presented by the media and encourage simple steps (e.g., hand hygiene, proper cough etiquette) to limit the spread of infectious diseases. Nurses looking to become more actively involved in public health education should seek outreach opportunities in their communities. Special attention should be paid to helping at-risk populations understand the special considerations they should take in emergency situations.",

Whether preparing for a natural disaster, mass casualty event, or disease outbreak, health care workers should endeavor to keep their emergency response skills up-to-date. Nurses need to be aware of the most recent care recommendations and research to provide evidence-based care to patients in all types of emergency care situations. Participating in drills and simulations can be an important way to identify any part of the emergency response that might be inadequate so that corrective measures can be taken.",

When health care workers travel abroad for any reason, they must be cognizant of potential pathogens that may return with them, especially as they return to work at domestic health care facilities. The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus in Saudi Arabia demonstrated how easily medical facilities can become the center of a disease outbreak 2 and the spread of the virus to other countries highlighted the role of travel in spreading disease through our interconnected modern world. 3",
