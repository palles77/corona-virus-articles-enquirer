            "text": "Background: The spread of pathogens via the airborne route is often underestimated, and little is known about the extent to which airborne microbial contamination levels vary throughout the day and night in hospital facilities. Aims: To evaluate airborne contamination levels within intensive care unit (ICU) isolation rooms over 10e24-h periods in order to improve understanding of the variability of environmental aerial bioburden, and the extent to which ward activities may contribute. Methods: Environmental air monitoring was conducted within occupied and vacant inpatient isolation rooms. A sieve impactor sampler was used to collect 500-L air samples every 15 min over 10-h (08:00e18:00 h) and 24-h (08:00e08:00 h) periods. Samples were collected, room activity was logged, and bacterial contamination levels were recorded as colony-forming units (cfu)/m 3 air. Findings: A high degree of variability in levels of airborne contamination was observed across all scenarios in the studied isolation rooms. Air bioburden increased as room occupancy increased, with air contamination levels highest in rooms occupied for the longest time during the study (10 days) (mean 104.4 cfu/m 3 , range 12e510 cfu/m 3 ). Counts were lowest in unoccupied rooms (mean 20 cfu/m 3 ) and during the night. Conclusion: Peaks in airborne contamination were directly associated with an increase in activity levels. This study provides the first clear evidence of the extent of variability in microbial airborne levels over 24-h periods in ICU isolation rooms, and found direct correlation between microbial load and ward activity.",

Fivehundred-litre air samples were collected every 15 min over 10-h (08:00e18:00 h) and 24-h (08:00e08:00 h) periods on to non-selective tryptone soya agar (TSA) plates (Oxoid Ltd, Basingstoke, UK), favourable for environmental sampling. An activity log was compiled to record room activity that may correlate with peaks in air contamination. After sampling, TSA plates were incubated at 37 C for 48 h and enumerated. The total number of microbial cfu on each plate was corrected for the statistical probability of multiple particles passing through the same hole by referring to correction tables supplied with the equipment [13] . The probable count was then used to calculate the cfu/m 3 sampled using the equation:",

Over the 24-h period, the mean air bioburden was 104.4 (SD 96.2) cfu/m 3 , with minimum and maximum recorded values of 12 and 510 cfu/m 3 , respectively. When the dataset was divided into 'day' and 'night' (08:00e20:00 h and 20:00e08:00 h, respectively), the mean airborne day count was 151.2 cfu/m 3 and the mean night count was 56.6 cfu/m 3 (P<0.001). The 'out-of-control' levels collected at 11:15e11:45 h (Observations 14e16) were a direct result of a high degree of room activity in which increased staff presence (from one to five) aided the movement of the patient from a bed via a mechanical hoist. Additionally, footfall in and out of the room was substantially higher during these samples, leading to a peak count of 510 cfu/m 3 , the highest level of air bioburden recorded across the entire set of case studies.

The movement or operation of large equipment into and around patient rooms (e.g. x-ray scanners, mechanical hoists, trolleys) resulted in an increase in air bioburden of 197.6%, with a range of 3.1e540.9% (N\u00bc16). An increase in staff numbers within patient rooms caused similar peaks in contamination levels.

However, it was interesting to observe that a patient turn activity, which resulted in a significant peak in air bioburden during the day (Figure 2c , Observations 34 and 75), had minimal effect when carried out at night. This potentially indicates that the activity of the ICU as a whole contributes to airborne contamination even within individual isolation rooms, highlighting how easily airborne microorganisms are dispersed through the ICU in general. Studies in burns units have demonstrated the ease with which bacteria are liberated from the patient into the air [21] . One study showed that 31% of dressing changes on MRSA-positive burns patients liberated the organism into the air [22] .

Previous studies have recorded similar results whereby mean counts of airborne MRSA from infected patients increased from 4.7 cfu/m 3 to 116 cfu/m 3 during bed sheet changes, and remained elevated for some time after the event [25] .

However, pneumonia and respiratory tract infections were the second largest group of HAIs, and accounted for 22.4% of the total HAIs in Scotland in 2016 [26] . All airborne microbes ultimately end up depositing on to surrounding surfaces, and so can contribute indirectly to infection transmission via direct surface contact. A recent study aimed to establish a correlation between air and surface microbes in the critical care environment, further emphasizing this phenomenon [20] . Their research found a strong association between passive air sampling counts and surface counts, and made the important point that surface bacteria will include a portion of airborne bacteria after settling. Settle plate standards were also proposed in 2000, as the 'index of microbial air contamination', a passive form of air sampling in which microbial contamination from the air is evaluated after it has settled on to the surface of agar plates [27] . Using settle plates as part of routine environmental screening for HAI risk from airborne contaminants could be a positive addition to infection control strategies; however, as shown in the present study through active air sampling, biologically active particles are present at all times in the air of the ICU, even in unoccupied rooms. Therefore, if using passive sampling methods, care should be taken to ensure that counts are not underestimated due to the potential for droplet nuclei to remain suspended for prolonged periods [6] .",

It is important to note that although certain activities resulted in high levels of air bioburden, this does not necessarily correlate with a high level of pathogenic organisms. Recently, it was shown that environmental bioburden measured by total colony count did not predict the presence of clinically relevant pathogenic organisms [28] . Additionally, viral collection was not possible with this methodology. Future consideration should be given to identification and correlation of airborne micro-organisms with strains originating from the patients housed in the environment; however, the scope of the present study was to assess overall variability of airborne bacteria and changes in response to key activities.",

Bioaerosol counts varied significantly across sampling periods; however, peaks were a direct result of room activity, particularly during the presence of increased numbers of medical staff and/or use of large equipment. Various other factors contributed to increased levels of air contamination, predominantly length of room occupation and people traffic. Although these results are specific to this ICU setting, this study provides insight into the typical background levels of airborne micro-organisms in the critical care setting, and how they change in response to the everyday operation of this dynamic environment. A greater understanding of the airborne transmission route and the clinical airborne microflora is required to understand the role of airborne pathogens in the spread of HAIs more fully, with the aim of establishing more direct and continuous infection control strategies.",

In patient-occupied rooms, rooms were occupied by patients for differing periods prior to the commencement of air sampling: (a) 10 days, (b) 6 days and (c) 1 day. Monitoring of an empty patient room was also included for comparison (d). For analysis, periods of day and night were categorized as 08:00e20:00 h and 20:00e08:00 h, respectively. Each data point represents the probable colony-forming units (cfu)/m 3 from air samples taken at 15-min intervals and incubated for 48 h.",
