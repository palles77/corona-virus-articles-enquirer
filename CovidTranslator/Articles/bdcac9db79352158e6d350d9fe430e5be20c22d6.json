We found that the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and a felinized murine hepatitis virus (fMHV), both normally incapable of infecting human cells, could rapidly and effectively kill human cancer cells artificially expressing the feline coronavirus receptor aminopeptidase N. Also 3-D multilayer tumor spheroids established from such cells were effectively eradicated. Next, we investigated whether FIPV and fMHV could be targeted to human cancer cells by constructing a bispecific single-chain antibody directed on the one hand against the feline coronavirus spike protein -responsible for receptor binding and subsequent cell entry through virus-cell membrane fusion -and on the other hand against the human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The targeting antibody mediated specific infection of EGFR-expressing human cancer cells by both coronaviruses. Furthermore, in the presence of the targeting antibody, infected cancer cells formed syncytia typical of productive coronavirus infection. By their potent cytotoxicity, the selective targeting of non-human coronaviruses to human cancer cells provides a rationale for further investigations into the use of these viruses as anticancer agents.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA viruses consisting of a nucleocapsid, which contains the approximately 30 kb genome and the nucleocapsid (N) protein, and which is surrounded by an envelope carrying three membrane proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), and matrix (M). Of these, the spike glycoprotein S is responsible for virus entry and syncytia formation, as it binds to the cellular receptor and induces membrane fusion. [3] [4] [5] The specific interaction between the amino-terminal spike protein domain S1 and its cognate receptor [6] [7] [8] induces conformational changes in the spike protein domain S2 that trigger the membrane fusion process. These con-formational changes require physical interaction between two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2, that occur in the S2 domain. Prevention of this interaction by using peptides that correspond to these HR1 and HR2 regions can block membrane fusion, by binding of the peptides to their respective counterparts. [9] [10] [11] Most coronaviruses exhibit strict species specificity, as determined by the spike-receptor interaction. [12] [13] [14] The coronavirus feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), for instance, selectively infects and induces syncytium formation of feline cells via its receptor feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN). 6 Likewise, the recombinant felinized mouse hepatitis virus (fMHV), 15 a derivative of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) carrying a chimeric spike of which the ectodomain is from the FIPV spike protein, also infects and fuses only feline cells through the fAPN molecule. As a consequence of their species restricted tropism, FIPV and MHV are nonpathogenic to human cells. However, once the tropism barrier is alleviated, coronaviruses can replicate in cells of different species. 15, 16 Thus, FIPV and MHV may potentially be converted into specific oncolytic agents for the treatment of human cancer if their spike protein would recognize a receptor on human tumor cells.",

As illustrated for fMHV (Figure 7a and b) , addition of fHR1 during or after inoculation of feline FCWF-4 cells abrogated infection and syncytium formation, respectively. Next, we determined whether scFv 23F-425-mediated infection and syncytium formation are also sensitive to the fHR1 peptide.

First, coronaviruses are positive-strand RNA Targeting non-human coronaviruses to human cancer cells T W\u00fcrdinger et al viruses that exhibit a fast, cytoplasmic transcription process leading to rapid virus protein synthesis and progeny virus production. Second, the ability of coronaviruses to induce syncytia between infected and noninfected neighboring cells amplifies their cytotoxicity. We found that FIPV and fMHV retained these properties in human cancer cells expressing the virus receptor, thus enabling a rapid cytotoxic spread of the virus to surrounding noninfected cancer cells. Coronaviruses share some of these attractive characteristics with other enveloped viruses such as a fusogenic mutant of herpes simplex virus 25 and the live attenuated Edmonston B vaccine strain of measles virus. 26 However, in contrast to these viruses, the coronaviruses FIPV and fMHV are normally incapable of infecting human cells, due to their restricted tropism. Thus, their native tropism does not need to be abolished in order to specifically limit their access, hence cytotoxicity, to human cancer cells. The ability to deliberately target viruses to preselected cells is a tremendous challenge with far-reaching implications for all kinds of therapeutic applications. Although we were able to demonstrate the principle of retargeting of coronaviruses by exchanging spike ectodomains, 15, 16 neither the detailed structural information nor the knowledge and technology required to purposely redesign the spike for binding to any given antigen are presently available. Therefore, as an alternative and also potentially versatile tool, we embarked on the development of a bispecific adapter. Thus, to redirect the non-human coronaviruses FIPV and fMHV to EGFRexpressing cells, we constructed the bispecific antibody molecule scFv 23F-425 that binds to both the feline spike and EGFR. The latter was chosen for its frequent overexpression on human cancer cells. Inoculation of Targeting non-human coronaviruses to human cancer cells T W\u00fcrdinger et al FIPV and fMHV onto a number of different EGFRexpressing human cancer cell lines of various tissue origins in the presence of scFv 23F-425 resulted in infection, replication, and subsequent formation of syncytia. The targeted infection was completely dependent on the presence of the antibody and its efficiency generally correlated with the levels of EGFR expression on the cancer cells. These observations are similar to native coronavirus infections where virus-cell and cellcell fusion efficiencies also correlate with host cell receptor density. 24 The results imply that the bispecific antibody-mediated targeting approach can in principle be applied to direct coronaviruses to any cell surface antigen for which an appropriate antibody (ie hybridoma cell line) is available.",

            "text": "The successful application of bispecific adapters for viral tumor therapy will depend, among others, on cell surface antigens that are -preferably -unique to the tumor. Useful tumor-specific markers have not yet been identified and future work should reveal whether they occur or can be specifically induced in tumor cells. Interestingly, for the attenuated measles virus, it was recently described that receptor density could also be a determinant of preferential tumor killing. 27 This indicates that even overexpression of certain receptors on tumor cells may result in tumor selective infection and subsequent cell killing. This may also be of importance for the targeting of coronaviruses, since similar receptor density dependence has been described to be important for coronavirus infection and syncytia formation. 24 The application also depends on the sufficient, local presence of the adapter. This might be achieved by incorporating the adapter gene sequence into the viral genome to have the virus produce its own targeting device. We have demonstrated this principle recently for the targeting of conditionally replicating adenoviruses. Thus, adenoviruses expressing a bispecific scFv for targeting to EGFR showed enhanced oncolytic replication in EGFR-positive, adenovirus receptor-negative cancer cells. 28 Foreign gene expression can also be achieved with coronaviruses as we showed recently after inserting different reporter genes at various positions in the MHV genome. 29 Coronaviruses exhibit high mutation rates and are prone to recombination. Their application in adaptermediated targeting to tumors will thus raise serious safety questions, particularly regarding the possibility of generating viruses that acquired the capacity to infect human cells independent of targeting devices. These questions will have to be addressed. Several options to reduce the risks already exist. One is the use of coronaviruses lacking specific virulence genes; as we showed recently for MHV 30 and FIPV, 31 such viruses are strongly attenuated in their natural host. Another option is to combine deletion of nonessential virulence genes with genomic rearrangement; reorganization of the order of the structural protein genes, found for MHV to be tolerated without loss of viability, 32 will reduce the risk of generating viable viruses by recombination with circulating field viruses.",

It appeared that the bispecific antibody-mediated entry, as well as the antibody-mediated induction of syncytia, uses this same fusion mechanism as was illustrated most clearly by the inhibitory effect of the HR1-derived peptide. It will be interesting to find out how this fusion process actually takes place and whether, for instance, the necessary conformational changes in the S protein are induced by its interaction with the antibody or triggered by the binding to the EGFR. Alternatively, fusion may not be mediated by the spikes that effect the binding but, rather, by the conformational changes induced in the 'free' spikes upon interaction with undefined molecules on the target cells or by the particular conditions experienced when the virus is taken up in endosomes. Evidence for the latter mechanism might be obtained by studying whether infection can also be achieved when using a bispecific antibody not binding the virus through the S protein but through one of the other envelope proteins, M or E, as these are not involved in the fusion process.",

After 1 h at 371C, the inoculum was replaced by regular culture medium and incubation of the cells was continued for 15 h. An immunostaining with serum directed against FIPV proteins was performed, after which the stained cells were counted and their numbers plotted against the amount of scFv 23F-425 used. The titration results revealed the optimal amount of bispecific antibody needed for maximal targeting efficiency under these standard conditions to be 200 ml scFv 23F-425. More antibody did not increase but, rather, decreased the level of infection, presumably because excess antibodies in the inoculum may bind to EGFR on cells thereby blocking their use by the virus. Cells inoculated with FIPV preincubated with mock control supernatant remained negative (data not shown).",
