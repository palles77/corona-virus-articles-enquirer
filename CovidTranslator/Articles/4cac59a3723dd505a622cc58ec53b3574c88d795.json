Of the 50 patients who failed to respond to CML treatment or had a poor response, 1 patient (2%) had a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. Thus patients who failed to achieved an optimal response to CML therapy appear more likely to have a symptomatic infection with SARS-CoV-2. This tendency requires further study, but there are two possibilities that might explain it. First, an optimal response to TKI treatment may be associated with immune recovery. CML patients exhibit selective depletion of effector T reg cells(eT reg cells) 23,24 , while TKIs increase the number of natural killer cells (NK), NK-LGL and T-LGLs cells 25 , which play a role in regulating immunity. Second, previous studies have reported that imatinib and other TKI drugs have antiviral activity in vitro against Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-COV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV) 26-28 . It will be interesting to see if TKIs also have activity against anti-SARS-CoV-2.We analyzed the 82 respondents living in Wuhan and found that there was 1 clinicallydiagnosed case (1.2%). Of the Japanese citizens evacuated from Wuhan, 8/565 (1.4%) had a confirmed infection with COVID-19 29 .
