This collaborative approach to resolving issues and questions in the field of clinical microbiology transcends organizational, institutional, state and national boundaries. Based upon observations of list communications during 10 weeks and a small group user su~y, this study analyzed the nature of communications and member's perceptions of the network. An explicit-tacit knowledge quadrant identifies distinct ways in which knowledge is transferred and created. Empirical evidence shows that ClinMicroNet complements other resources by encouraging members to share experiences and collaborate in establishing the best practices. Driven by a core group of active members, the network is highly participative and strongly supported. In turn, members maintain professional relationships beyond the list, which reinforces the network and its members' capacity to confront new threats and challenges in clinical microbiology.",

By creating an active discussion forum, members are made aware of new developments in the field, and are able to discuss problems as they emerge and to resolve practical issues, receiving the opinions of professional colleagues who have faced similar questions in their own work. Moreover, in highly specialized fields, doubts about practices can often be resolved only through discussion with other experts who work in the same area but in different hospitals and geographical regions. Being connected with a group of professionals across the U.S. and around the world encourages members to collaborate in resolving these problems, and benefiting from the collective experience of the group.",

Confirmation was found in the member survey, where all but one respondent had attended either the ASM General Meeting or Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. Prior to the ASM meeting in May 2002, two or three notifications were posted to the listserv regarding meetings for ClinMicroNet members at the conference, including the annual ClinMicroNet box lunch. Dr. Michael Miller, who initiated the concept of the ClinMicroNet and serves as its administrator, also started the ClinMicroNet member meetings at the ASM General Meeting. He commented that \". . .it is always good to get folks together and meet each other. This killed two birds with one stone, it was the catalyst that tripled the attendance at the annual Division C meeting. Prior to inviting ClinMicroNet members to the meeting to join each other for the lunch, attendance at this meeting was usually between 40 and 80 people. Now it is well over 150 to 200\" (4).
