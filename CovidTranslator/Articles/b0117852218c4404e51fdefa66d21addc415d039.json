Few reports have been focused on the expression of TGFb during PRRSV infection and the scarce results are controversial. Whereas no enhancement Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome Tonsil Lung Serum Transforming growth factor beta A B S T R A C T Transforming growth factor b (TGFb) is an immunomodulatory cytokine which is able to modulate the host immune response eliciting an inefficient response against pathogens. In this sense, the role of this cytokine in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) has been poorly studied and the reported results are contradictory. Thus, in the present study, the expression of TGFb was analysed both at tissue (lymphoid organs and lung) and serum level to study its correlation with the expression of PRRS virus (PRRSV). To carry out this study, 32 pigs were inoculated with the European PRRSV field isolate 2982 and sequentially killed from 0 dpi to the end of the study (24 dpi). Blood and tissue samples were collected to determine the expression of PRRSV and TGFb. PRRSV was detected in inoculated animals from 3 dpi until the end of the study, however TGFb was not detected in sera from inoculated animals. Contrary, an increase of TGFb antigen was observed both in the lymphoid organs and in the lung of PRRSV-inoculated pigs when compared with control group. Since TGFb play a role as an immunomodulatory cytokine of the immune response and also in the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Tregs), the upregulation of the TGFb at tissue level may play a role in the impairment of the host immune response observed during PRRS, being observed a significant correlation between PRRSV and TGFb expression at lung level.",

            "text": "In our study, the lack of lesions and viraemia in control animals, and the evidence of both histopathological lesions and viraemia in infected animals, support the efficient infection of inoculated animals. However, no serum expression of TGFb was detected throughout the study neither in control nor in infected animals, contrary to the results obtained from the immunohistochemical study. Recently, an enhancement in the expression of TGFb has been reported for type II PRRSV genotypes (Silva-Campa et al., 2009; Renukaradhya et al., 2010) but not for type I genotypes (D\u00edaz et al., 2005 (D\u00edaz et al., , 2006 Silva-Campa et al., 2010) . This finding may be related to the higher virulence attributed to type II genotypes of PRRSV (Mart\u00ednez-Lobo , 2011) , which usually trigger off a more accentuated cytokines cascade. In our study, the lack of serum expression of TGFb together with the local expression of this cytokine at lymphoid organs and lung level, confirm this hypothesis, and point to a role for the local expression of cytokines in the modulation of the immune response in infections with European PRRSV isolates. In our study the immunohistochemical study showed a significant correlation between the lung expression of PRRSV and TGFb in infected animals, but no correlation was observed between these parameters neither in the mediastinal lymph node nor in the tonsil of infected animals. These results may point either to different roles of TGFb in each infected organ or to different mechanisms involved in the synthesis of this cytokine in each organ during PRRS. Interestingly, similar findings were observed concerning the expression of PRRSV and IL-10 in the examined organs in parallel studies carried out by our research group (G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2010b; Barranco et al., 2011a) , which suggests a synergic action between the local expression of TGFb and IL-10. The correlation observed between PRRSV and TGFb antigens in the lung in the present study points to a direct induction of the production of TGFb by PRRSV replication, whereas the different trend showed by these parameters in lymphoid organs suggests that either TGFb may play a minor role in the modulation of the immune response in the mediastinal lymph node and in the tonsil of PRRSV-infected pigs or that an indirect mechanism might be involved in the expression of this cytokine in these organs during PRRSV infection.",

Conversely, in the present study the expression of TGFb was mainly observed in PAMs and secondly in other cells, such as septal macrophages, neutrophils and/or lymphocytes. Thus, taking into account the immunomodulatory role of TGFb (Letterio and Roberts, 1998) , the expression of this cytokine by PAMs may be involved in the lack of expression of IFNg by these cells, and the subsequent lack of activation and impairment of PAMs, which favour secondary bacterial infections. In addition, comparing our results with parallel studies from our group (Barranco et al., 2011a) the enhancement on the expression of TGFb observed in the present study coincided with a lower expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the lung and lymphoid organs of pigs inoculated with PRRSV field isolate 2982 (G\u00f3 mez-Laguna et al., 2010a; Barranco et al., 2011a) . All these findings suggest that the expression of TGFb may play a significant role not only in the modulation of the immune response at local levels but also limiting the onset of an exacerbated inflammatory response.",

Nonetheless, few studies have been yet performed to determine the role of Tregs in PRRS. Thus, a TGFb-dependent induction of Th3 cells by PRRSVinfected dendritic cells has been reported (Silva-Campa et al., 2009 ). In the present study we observed an enhancement in the expression of TGFb in the lung and lymphoid organs of PRRSV-infected animals from 3 dpi onwards, which may be involved in the induction of Tregs observed by other authors. Further studies are being conducted to confirm the role of TGFb in the induction of Tregs during PRRS.",

The expression of this cytokine may either favour or difficult the onset of an efficient host immune response. On the one hand, TGFb may be able both to avoid overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines at tissue level and to difficult PRRSV replication by downregulating the expression of CD163. On the other hand, TGFb may impair the host immune response by (1) inhibiting an efficient expression of antiviral cytokines, and/or (2) inducing the differentiation of Tregs.",
