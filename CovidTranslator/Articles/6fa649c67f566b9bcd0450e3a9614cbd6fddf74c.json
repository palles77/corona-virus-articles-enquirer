These microbial detection arrays occupy a middle ground between low cost, narrowly focused assays such as multiplex PCR and more expensive, broad-spectrum technologies like high-throughput sequencing. While pathogen detection arrays have been used primarily in a research context, several groups are aggressively working to develop arrays for clinical diagnostics, food safety testing, environmental monitoring and biodefense. Statistical algorithms that can analyze data from microbial detection arrays and provide easily interpretable results are absolutely required in order for these efforts to succeed. In this article, we will review the most promising array designs and analysis algorithms that have been developed to date, comparing their strengths and weaknesses for pathogen detection and discovery.",

In addition, global conflicts over the past decade have raised concerns that pathogenic agents might be released deliberately by terrorist organizations or other entities. Public and private funding agencies have responded to these concerns by investing heavily in the development of new assays for microbial surveillance and discovery. The majority of these new methods involve direct detection of microbial nucleic acids. Ideally, these methods should be effective both as detection assays (for identification of known pathogens) and as discovery techniques (for revealing the presence of novel, previously uncharacterized organisms).",

In order of increasing cost, these are the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [1] , oligonucleotide microarrays [2] and DNA sequencing [3] . These platforms have different strengths and weaknesses. While sequencing provides the most in-depth, unbiased information, and is able to reveal completely novel organisms, it can be costly and time-consuming for some applications, particularly when the resources required for data processing and analysis are taken into account. Although multiplex sequencing of bar-coded samples reduces the cost per sample, it also decreases the coverage and thus the sensitivity of the analysis; this may be an issue when the organism of interest has low abundance and the sample has not been treated beforehand to remove host and/or background DNA.",

Arrays can be designed with a combination of high-specificity probes and probes designed against conserved regions, so that they can be used in both detection and discovery modes. While most array designs select probes from fully sequenced genomes in GenBank and other databases, cross-hybridization between probes and similar but non-identical sequences allows detection of novel species, provided that they are closely related to those that were used for probe design.

Oligos may be spotted onto the array by mechanical deposition [2] , sprayed on with a modified inkjet printer head [6] or synthesized in situ through a series of photocatalyzed reactions [7] . Probes are placed on the array in a rectangular grid of 'features', each containing many copies of the same oligo.

Arrays may be subdivided with a gasket into subarrays, allowing multiple samples to be tested on one slide. Replicate features, scattered randomly across the array, may be used to allow correction for scratches and spatial effects.

Thus, identification of an unknown target using this array relies on comparison of the observed intensity pattern to a compendium of signatures acquired by hybridizing known targets to the array. The primary advantage of the universal array approach is that the probes are not specific to genomes that have already been sequenced, so that the array design does not need to be updated as new genomes become available; this is a unique characteristic of the universal array approach. The principal disadvantage is the lack of any means of predicting signatures for organisms of known sequence; these must be obtained experimentally for every species of interest.

A probe is counted toward the minimum representation if it has an alignment to the target genome with at least 85% identity and with a 29-mer perfect match subsequence. Bacterial probes are selected from full genome sequences, rather than from 16S rRNA genes as in the GreeneChip, enabling strain-level discrimination for most bacteria.

Unlike most of the methods discussed here, it is not tightly coupled to any particular array platform, and runs in any computing environment that supports the R language, including Mac OS X, Unix/Linux and Windows. To normalize probe intensities, DetectiV divides them by a reference intensity, which may be either the mean of a set of designated control probes, the global median intensity for the array or the intensity of the corresponding probe on a reference array; the logarithm of the intensity ratio is then reported for each probe. Significance testing is performed by selecting groups of probes sharing common family, species, or other annotations, and computing a one-sample t-test, with the null hypothesis that the log intensity ratio for each group is zero. The DetectiV software leaves interpretation of the log ratio and t-test results to the user; it does not correct P-values for multiple testing, nor does it define any threshold values for 'detection' of a particular species. Typically a user will rank families or species by P-value, and examine the log intensity ratios for the top n groups to decide which species are most likely to be present. DetectiV may thus be regarded as a useful package for exploratory data analysis, rather than a rigorous statistical tool. Nevertheless, the authors found that, when applied to two ViroChip data sets used in the E-Predict study [32] , DetectiV gave better prediction performance than E-Predict.",

Given a 'match matrix' M \u00bc [m ij ], in which m ij \u00bc 1 if probe i matches target j and 0 if not, PhyloDetect groups targets into a nested hierarchy, based on the similarity of their column vectors in the match matrix. Targets that are indistinguishable (because their match vectors are identical) are collapsed. This grouping is done once for each array design and candidate target set. To analyze an array, PhyloDetect reduces the probe intensities to binary indicators (e.g. by thresholding against the median \u00fe2 SD of the background intensities), and performs a series of hypothesis tests, one for each group in the hierarchy. Interestingly, the null hypothesis in each test is that an organism in the group is present; the alternative is that no organism in the group is present. The test statistic is based on the number of probes matching the group that have zero indicators, and a probe-independent false negative rate . If there are n probes matching the group, the likelihood of observing r or more probes below the detection threshold is the complement of the cumulative binomial distribution,",

The threshold value is determined from the distribution of negative control probe intensities on the array, and is used to distinguish target-specific signals from signals due to nonspecific hybridization. Essentially, CLiMax reduces the probe intensities to binary variables, which are described by a logistic regression model. The apparent loss of information implied here is mitigated by the fact that, in most experiments, probe intensities fall into two distinct clusters, one near the optical saturation limit and the other near the background fluorescence level. The covariates in the logistic regression model are derived from BLAST alignments of probe sequences to targets in a database of microbial genomes: the BLAST score, the alignment start position within the probe sequence and a melting temperature computed for the aligned DNA duplex. Coefficients for the model predictors are fitted to data from hybridizations to targets with known genome sequences. The CLiMax logistic regression model also includes a term to account for the observation that probes with low sequence complexity are more likely than others to hybridize nonspecifically to dissimilar targets. It measures sequence complexity by the entropy of the frequency distribution of trimers in the probe sequence.",

The four human papillomavirus strains listed first have scores substantially above zero, indicating their likely presence in the sample; these were in fact confirmed by an independent assay. The primary weaknesses of the CLiMax approach are its assumption (shared by VIPR and other likelihood-based algorithms) that probe intensities are conditionally independent, and its greedy algorithm for selecting multiple targets. The independence assumption is violated when probes are designed against a large set of related strains that are similar but not identical. When this happens, and the sample contains DNA with a similar sequence originating from a genome that is not part of the target database, a large number of probes may cross-hybridize to it. Since the probes contribute additively to the log-odds score, a false-positive target prediction may result. These errors can be recognized by examining the locations of the positive probes in each predicted target genome and eliminating targets for which only probes in a narrow subregion are detected.",
