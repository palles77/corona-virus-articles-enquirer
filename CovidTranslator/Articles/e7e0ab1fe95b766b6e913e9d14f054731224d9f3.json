Two patients, a 11-year old girl and her mother, maintained IgG and IgM-negative status during hospitalization, indicating that they did not undergo serological conversion during the observation period. Unfortunately, these two patients were lost for follow-up and the delayed seroconversion cannot be excluded. Serological courses could be followed for 27 patients who were initially seronegative and then underwent a seroconversion during the observation (IgG seroconversion in 19 patients, IgM seroconversion in 20 patients and both seroconversion in 13 patients). All these patients achieved a seroconversion of IgG or IgM within 20 days after symptoms onset. The median day of seroconversion for both lgG and IgM was 13 days (after symptoms onset) (Fig. 3A) . Three types of seroconversion can be observed: synchronous seroconversion of IgG and IgM (10 cases); IgM seroconverted earlier than that of IgG (7 cases); IgM seroconverted later than that of IgG (10 cases). The longitudinal changes of antibody in 6 representative patients of three types were shown in Fig. 3B-D and Fig. S2 . Based on this finding, we recommend that either IgM or IgG seroconversion be used as a confirmation criterion of recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. We tried to identify the factors associated with the different seroconversion types, but found no association between these types and age or gender or hospitalization time (data not shown).",

This finding indicates that SARS-CoV-2 infection can be ruled out if antibody against SARS-CoV-2 is still undetectable after 20 days of symptoms onset, or after 23 days from exposure (20 days plus a median incubation of 3-day [9] ). A mother and her daughter did not achieve a seroconversion of either IgG or IgM during the hospitalization, emphasizing the necessity of a combination of antibody and RT-PCR tests. Secondly, there is no general rule for the chronological order of IgM and IgG seroconversion for a specific patient, which resembles the conditions in SARS and MERS [2, 11, 12] . This supports the detection of both the IgG and IgM simultaneously rather than the single antibody alone. Thirdly, the confirmation criteria of the serological test for MERS recommended by the WHO can apply to a majority of COVID-19 patients. 82.9% (34/41) of the patients can be diagnosed by the 2 criteria: seroconversion or a \u2265 4-fold increase in the IgG titer in acute (ideally during the first week of illness) and convalescent serum samples [10] . The leading cause for the missing of the patients (12.2% (5/41)) by the criteria is a very early seroconversion (within 7 days or even -4 days of symptoms onset) of IgG in these patients (Fig. 3B, middle panel) . This finding highlights the importance of collecting the first sample as early as possible. On the other hand, we argue that for those patients missed the ideal sampling window, a second serological test several days (for example, 3 days) later that confirms the first positive results would be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis, if with symptoms or chest imaging evidence simultaneously.",

Early case detection is one of the most important public health interventions in controlling the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 cases can be identified based on exposure status, symptoms and chest imaging, but the confirmation of infection requires nucleic acid testing of nasal, pharyngeal or anal swab. Although real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)-based viral RNA detection is the sensitive and accurate way to confirm the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in practice, dozens of suspects with clinical symptoms were failed to be diagnosed by RT-PCR test. The risk of falsely-negative results may be introduced by RT-PCR method due to several possible factors, such as quality of specimen collection, PCR reagents from different sources, multi-steps of RNA preparation and fluctuations of virus load in different phases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Due to the limitations of RT-PCR, serum specific antibody detection for COVID-19 is advisable because of the relatively short time to diagnosis and the ability to probe an active immune response against the virus.",
