Most clinically relevant hematopoietic growth factors in veterinary medicine are erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and granulocytemacrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Ogilvie, 1995) . Since species-specific growth factors are commercially unavailable for veterinary medicine, recombinant human growth factors that are FDAapproved for human use are being used in animals (Ogilvie, 1995) . Recombinant human EPO (rHuEPO), which enhances red blood cell production, can be used in veterinary medicine as a therapy for anemia resulting from chronic renal failure, cancer, chemotherapy, and to reduce the need for transfusion during surgery (Ogilvie, 1995) . Similar to their use in humans, recombinant human G-CSF (rHuG-CSF) and GM-CSF (rHuGM-CSF) can be used to increase the production and functional activity of neutrophils and monocytes in animals that have infectious disease or chemotherapyinduced myelosuppression (Ogilvie, 1995) . However, these drugs are not veterinary-labeled products and the potential risks must be considered in relation to the therapeutic benefits for veterinary use. Foremost, the potential for adverse reactions caused by the development of antibodies to these human products may be a limiting factor for the long-term use.",

Hematological abnormalities, such as anemia, neutropenia, and lymphopenia are typical manifestations of FIV infection in cats. Hence, the use of hematopoietic growth factor(s) can greatly benefit the FIV-infected cats by improving the quality of life. Findings from short-term studies have already been reported on the use of rHuEPO and rHuGM-CSF as supportive therapy in FIV-infected cats (Arai et al., 2000) . These studies demonstrate that rHuEPO could be used safely in FIV-infected cats to increase RBC count without changing FIV status or developing anti-rHuEPO antibodies. When compared to rHuEPO, the efficacy of rHuGM-CSF was remarkably low, resulting in 50% increase of neutrophils and monocytes in treated cats with the production of anti-rHuGM-CSF antibodies and an increase in FIV load (Arai et al., 2000) . As a result, the use of rHuGM-CSF is not recommended in FIV-infected cats, requiring an alternative drug be identified for treating neutropenia in these animals.",

However, no studies have been reported to date on the efficacy of rHuG-CSF treatment in FIV-infected cats. Unlike GM-CSF that regulates the development of earlier uncommitted progenitor cells, such as stem cells and multipotent progenitors, G-CSF stimulates predominantly the proliferation, differentiation, and activation of committed neutrophil-granulocyte progenitors into functionally mature neutrophils (Hollingshead and Goa, 1991) .

The T-cell-enriched PBMC were derived by stimulating PBMC with T-cell mitogen, ConA, for 3 days and culturing the cells for an additional 2 weeks in culture media. The culture media was the same as the assay media for proliferation with the exception of 10% heat-inactivated FCS and the addition of 100 U/ml recombinant human IL-2. The T-cell-enriched PBMC were inoculated with FIV at 25-100 tissue culture median infectious dose (TCID 50 ) and cultured for 3 weeks in culture media that were supplemented with set concentrations of rHuG-CSF (0-100 ng/ml). The culture supernatants were collected every 3 days and the cells were resuspended in fresh culture media containing appropriate concentrations of rHuG-CSF. The supernatants were tested for FIV titers by reverse transcriptase (RT) assay as previously described (Rey et al., 1984) . In other studies, primary PBMC or BM cells from FIV-infected cats were cocultured with uninfected T-cell-enriched PBMC for 3 weeks in culture medium that was supplemented with set concentrations of rHuG-CSF. T-cell-enriched PBMC were >98% T-cells based on phenotypic analysis with Pan-T antibody (Yamamoto et al., 1998) . The primary PBMC had neutrophil contamination of 15-25%, whereas T-cell-enriched PBMC had no detectable neutrophils based on microscopy with Wright-stain. The supernatants were collected for RT assay as described above.",

Upon confirmation of FIV infection, these cats were used in a cross-over study consisting of two 3-week treatments separated by a 5-week rest period. Initially (study part 1), three experimental cats (#9QE, #9QG, and #9QJ) received 5 mg/kg s.c. injection of rHuG-CSF (Neupogen 1 Filgrastim) daily for 3 weeks, while three control cats (#9QF, #9QH, and #9QI) received an equivalent volume of s.c. saline as a placebo. Following a 5-week rest period, the cat groups were reversed (study part 2) and the study repeated using the same established treatment regimen. Approximately, 3-5 months after completion of the cross-over study, three cats (#9QG, #9QH, and #9QI) were re-treated s.c. once a day for 1 week with 5 mg/kg of rHuG-CSF.",

The primary PBMC from two of four SPF cats had slight irregular non-dose-dependent increases in proliferation response to varying concentrations of rHuG-CSF ( Fig. 1, part A1 ). In contrast, slight but more consistent dose-dependent increases in proliferation response were observed with BM cells from all four SPF cats ( Fig. 1 , part A2). However, these increases in BM proliferation were not statistically significant. Consequently, PBMC and BM cells from FIV-infected cats were not tested for proliferation response to rHuG-CSF but they were used to determine the in vitro effects of rHuG-CSF treatment on FIV replication. None of the PBMC and BM cell cultures (in vitroly infected T-cell-enriched PBMC, and PBMC and BM cells from FIV-infected cats) had an increase in FIV replication due to rHuG-CSF treatment (Fig. 1 , parts B1-B3). Hence, these in vitro results demonstrate that rHuG-CSF has no direct effect on the FIV replication in PBMC and BM cells even though slight proliferation of uninfected BM cells occurred in response to rHuG-CSF stimulation.",

In our previous study, we treated FIV-infected cats with rHuGM-CSF instead of rHuG-CSF because multilineage activity of GM-CSF could be more useful for immune reconstitution of FIV-infected cats (Arai et al., 2000) . However, only 50% of rHuGM-CSF-treated cats responded to the treatment by having an increase in neutrophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, RBC, or their combination. In addition to increasing multiple populations of hematocytes in FIV-infected cats, concomitant 1-2 log increases in FIV load were observed during the rHuGM-CSF treatment. Unlike the rHuGM-CSF studies, current rHuG-CSF studies clearly demonstrate that FIV load is not increased by rHuG-CSF treatment of cats, suggesting that this drug is more selective for neutrophils than for monocytes. In fact, pronounced statistically significant increases in neutrophil counts were observed with rHuG-CSF treatment ( Fig. 2C and D) when compared to slight irregular increases in monocyte counts with no statistical significance ( Fig. 2I and J) . Moreover, rHuGM-CSF had significant effect on FIV load in peripheral blood whereas rHuG-CSF did not. Since FIV productively infects monocytes/macrophages but not neutrophils (Kubes et al., 2003) , this observation demonstrates the importance of neutrophil count increases compared to the slight irregular monocyte increases. Unlike rHuGM-CSF, rHuG-CSF did not increase the in vitro FIV replication of monocytecontaining PBMC and BM cells from FIV-infected cats (Fig. 1, parts B2 and 1B3) .",

            "text": "Three cats, which developed anti-rHuG-CSF neutralizing antibody titers in the first 3 weeks of treatment, were re-treated with rHuG-CSF for 7 days to determine whether neutralizing antibody development would reoccur after 3-5 months without supplemental treatment (Fig. 3C , E and F). All three cats had minimal ( 1:50) or no detectable anti-rHuG-CSF neutralizing antibody titers at the beginning of the re-treatment period. The titers from two cats significantly increased to 1:135 and >1:500 by retreatment day 7 ( Fig. 3C and E) . Corresponding to this antibody increase, there was a slight increase in neutrophil counts by re-treatment day 4 followed by a sharp decrease in neutrophil numbers by re-treatment day 7 returning to or near to baseline titers. In contrast, cat #9QI in absence of prednisolone therapy responded to rHuG-CSF re-treatment with a sharp neutrophil increase on re-treatment day 4 that continued through day 7, despite the developing anti-rHuG-CSF neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 3F ). Three weeks post-re-treatment study, this cat developed high fever (105.7 8F), underwent high-dose prednisolone therapy, and was euthanized shortly thereafter. At the time of euthanasia, this cat had proteinuria (8.9 g/dl), feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)/coronavirus titer of 1:400, and a histopathology revealing uncharacteristic FIP-related intestinal lesions (Harvey et al., 1996) . Thus, the neutrophilic increase of cat #9QI during the re-treatment study may be caused by FIP-associated neutrophilia (Hoskins, 1997) . Whereas, the other two cats (without prednisolone) responded to the re-treatment with a decrease in neutrophil counts upon development of high anti-rHuG-CSF neutralizing antibody titers, even though retrospective study of their re-treatment sera demonstrated FIP/coronavirus titers of 1:50 in cat #9QG and 1:200 in cat #9QH.",

Even under a prednisolone treatment, this cat was able to respond to rHuG-CSF treatment (study part 2) with a neutrophil increase and with only a transient two-fold increase in FIP/coronavirus antibody titer (from 1:50 to 1:100) and no signs of FIP disease. This result suggests that rHuG-CSF treatment in combination with prednisolone therapy safely elevated the neutrophil counts and M:E ratio in the FIV and FIP co-infected cat without causing clinical illness ( Fig. 2C and Table 1 ). Moreover, no other cats housed in the same quarter, including cats #9QG and #9QH, had detectable titers to FIP/ coronavirus or exhibited clinical FIP signs during Parts 1 and 2 of the study. Hence, their rHuG-CSF treatment results during this period were not affected by ongoing FIP infection in cat #9QI.",

            "text": "Recombinant HuG-CSF differs from FeG-CSF by 28.8% in amino acid (aa) identity (Yamamoto, unpublished data) . Consequently, at least 28.8% of the rHuG-CSF is foreign to the feline immune system and such foreign epitopes can potentially stimulate the feline lymphocytes that may enhance the replication of FIV. In addition, rHuGM-CSF, which differs from FeGM-CSF by 31.2% in aa identity, has been reported to increase FIV replication of primary feline PBMC and T-cell-enriched PBMC cultures (Arai et al., 2000) . Unlike rHuGM-CSF, our studies demonstrate that rHuG-CSF can be used for FIV-infected cats to increase neutrophil counts without enhancing FIV infection. However, rHuG-CSF neutralizing antibodies developed as early as day 14 of treatment since 28.8% of the rHuG-CSF aa sequence is foreign to the feline immune system. Moreover, the long-term use or repeated cycle of treatment may result in the production of neutralizing antibodies to HuG-CSF, including cross-neutralizing antibodies to endogenous FeG-CSF. Similar studies on the effect of recombinant canine G-CSF (rCaG-CSF) treatment in cats show the lack of neutrophil decline beyond 21 days of treatment with rCaG-CSF, suggesting no production of neutralizing antibodies to rCaG-CSF (Colgan et al., 1992; Obradovich et al., 1993) . Since G-CSF of cats and dogs differ by 18.5% in aa identity, the potential of developing neutralizing antibodies to rCaG-CSF in cats is a concern and the use of rFeG-CSF is preferred.",

            "text": "A recent short-term rFeG-CSF study suggests that treatment of cats with rFeG-CSF is a better treatment option than with either rHuG-CSF or rCaG-CSF (Yamamoto et al., unpublished observation) . The 11day treatment study with high daily dose (50 mg/dose) of rFeG-CSF demonstrates a rapid increase in neutrophil counts with no signs of anti-rFeG-CSF antibody production based solely on the neutrophil kinetics at the time of drug withdrawal (Yamamoto et al., unpublished observation) . However, our studies suggest that 11 days of treatment may be too short to observe the antibodies to rFeG-CSF, since this product is homologous in aa sequence to endogenous FeG-CSF. According to published reports of antibody production to homologous growth factor in humans, about 3% of subjects treated with rHuG-CSF only developed ELISA-based antibodies without developing neutralizing antibodies to rHuG-CSF (Amgen Inc., 2004) . Like rHuG-CSF treatment of HIV-infected individuals, long-term and recurrent treatments with rFeG-CSF may be important for FIV-infected cats that are more susceptible to recurrent bacterial infection due to their immunodeficient state (Pedersen et al., 1987; Yamamoto et al., 1988a; Shelton et al., 1990; Fleming et al., 1991; Sparkes et al., 1993) . The commercial development of rFeG-CSF is in its infancy and cost prohibitive due to the difficulty of large-scale production of rFeG-CSF because of the low yield in more conventional expression systems, such as E. coli . In addition, rHuG-CSF is still considered cost prohibitive for longterm use in feline medicine. Hence, future effort should be placed on the cost effective, commercial development of rFeG-CSF, which can be used effectively and safely in cats without the production of neutralizing antibodies that block drug activity.",

Primary feline PBMC (A1) and BM cells (A2) from SPF cats were tested for its proliferation responses to 10-fold dilutions (1-100 ng/ml) of rHuG-CSF. In the next set of experiments, the ability of rHuG-CSF in 10-fold dilutions to enhance the in vitro FIV infection was tested. T-cell-enriched PBMC were inoculated with FIV at the time of first rHuG-CSF treatment and subsequently monitored for FIV replication by measuring RT activity (B1). In other experiments, PBMC (B2) and BM cells (B3) from FIV-infected cats were co-cultured with uninfected T-cell-enriched PBMC in the presence of rHuG-CSF and monitored for FIV replication. All assays were performed in triplicate and typical results from three to five separate experiments are shown.",
