Leukocytes were incubated with infectious viruses or control media for 24 h and then challenged with anti-IgE for 45 min and the amount of histamine released into the supernatant fluids was determined. The results of a typical experiment with the cells from one individual are shown in Fig. 1 . Leukocytes that had been treated with HSV-1 showed enhanced histamine release when exposed to anti-IgE (P < 0.001). At the optimum anti-IgE concentration, the cells cultured with control media released 20% histamine whereas cells cultured with HSV-1 released 36% (Fig. 1 a) . Similarly, leukocytes incubated with Influenza A and then challenged with anti-IgE showed enhanced histamine release (P < 0.001). At optimum concentrations of anti-IgE, cells treated with control allanteic fluids released 22% histamine, whereas cells treated with Influenza A released 51% histamine ( Fig. 1 b) . Incubation of cells with Adeno-1 also resulted in a statistically significant increase in histamine release (P < 0.001), although the absolute enhancement was not as pronounced as with the other viruses ( challenged with different concentrations of anti-IgE. The data in Fig. 2 show that leukocytes incubated with either infectious or UV-inactivated virus released significantly more histamine than leukocytes exposed to control media (P < 0.001). Paired t tests revealed no significant difference between the curves generated by infectious vs. UV-inactivated virus (P > 0.1). In subsequent histamine release experiments, UV-inactivated viruses were used. To see if the increase in histamine release was due to activation of phagocytesis, leukocytes were incubated with latex beads for 24 h. Analysis of the supernatant fluids after incubation of the leukocytes with anti-IgE failed to reveal any enhancement of histamine release (data not shown).",

Leukocytes from tim seventh donor released high amounts of histamine on challenge with anti-IgE and the presence of virus did not result in further enhancement. The demonstration that both infectious and UV-inactivated virus enhanced histamine release indicated that viral replication was not required, and raised the possibility that enhancement might be immune specific. To study this possibility, the relationship between the level of anti-HSV neutralizing antibody and histamine release was investigated. Preliminary experiments (data not shown) revealed that exposure of leukocytes from anti-HSV-1 negative individuals to UV-inactivated HSV-1 resulted in enhanced histamine release.",

If, however, these leukocyte cultures were first incubated with virus and then challenged with ragweed antigen E or anti-IgE, a marked enhancement of histamine release occurred. Both infectious and nonin- fectious viruses were effective. Examination of the culture fluids revealed that the enhancement of histamine release was associated with a soluble factor that had the properties of interferon. Several lines of evidence indicate that interferon, in fact, was responsible for the enhancement of histamine release. First, all stimulants that enhanced histamine release (i.e., viruses and poly I:poly C) also induced interferon. In contrast, stimulants that did not enhance histamine release (Simian foamy virus, PRK cell control, allantoic fluids, RPMI medium) did not induce interferon (25) . Second, there was a direct relationship between both the time of appearance and the amount of interferon in the culture fluids and the degree of histamine enhancement. Third, all preparations of human interferon, regardless of the tissue of origin (i.e. leukocytes or fibroblasts), were effective. Controls not containing interferon and heterologous interferon (i.e. mouse) were ineffective. Fourth, the soluble factor responsible for the enhancement of histamine release could not be dissociated from the antiviral activity of interferon by standard physicochemical means. Whether the enhancement of histamine release by interferon requires new RNA and protein synthesis (e.g., the reputed \"antiviral protein\" of interferon) is presently under investigation.",

            "text": "How interferon enhances histamine release is not clear. It is known that in preparations of human leukocytes, histamine is present only in basophils. These basophils have specific receptors for IgE and such receptors are not present on other leukocytes (19, 27) . The release of histamine is triggered by the bridging of two IgE molecules on the basophil surface (28) . The reaction can be initiated by either ragweed antigen E or anti-IgE and the two mechanisms appear identical (29) . The release of histamine from the cell is a secretory process and does not result in cell death. This secretory process is modulated by the level of intracellular cyclic AMP, and agents such as isoproterenol, prostaglandin E, cholera toxin, or theophylline, which raise intracellular levels of cyclic AMP, will inhibit the release of histamine. Agents which either decrease cyclic AMP levels (e.g., imidazole, a-adrenergic compounds, PGF~), or increase cyclic GMP levels (e.g., exogenous cyclic GMP, carbamylcholine) have been reported to enhance histamine release from lung mast cells (30, 31) , but thus far not from peripheral basophils (32) . Microtubules and microfilaments also play a role in this secretory process; colchicine, which inhibits microtubular aggregation, inhibits the release reaction. Heavy water, which in many systems promotes microtubular aggregation, enhances histamine release and also reverses the action of colchicine (33, 34) . Cytochalasin B, an agent known to disrupt microfilaments, also will enhance the IgE-mediated histamine release reaction (34) (35) (36) . Whether or not interferon enhances histamine release by altering cyclic nucleotide levels, promoting microtubule aggregation, disrupting microfilaments, or some other mechanism remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Human leukocytes maintained in culture are induced to release histamine when exposed to ragweed antigen E or anti-IgE. Leukocyte cultures incubated with virus (i.e. HSV-1, Influenza A, and Adeno-1) but not exposed to ragweed antigen E or anti-IgE fail to release histamine. If, however, leukocyte cultures are first exposed to virus and then to ragweed antigen E or anti-IgE, significant enhancement of histamine release occurs. Both infectious and inactivated virus enhance histamine release and the degree of enhancement is related to the concentration of virus and the length of the incubation. Tissue culture fluid harvested 8 h after exposure of leukocytes to virus contains a soluble factor which is capable of enhancing histamine release when added to fresh leukocyte cultures. This factor has all the properties of interferon including species specificity and cannot be dissociated from the antiviral activity of interferon. Moreover, both known inducers of interferon (poly I:poly C) and standard preparations of interferon are capable of enhancing histamine release. The enhancement of histamine release by interferon represents a new biological role for interferon.",
