            "text": "To determine the aetiological role and epidemiological profile of common respiratory viruses in adults with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs), a 2-year study was conducted in Beijing, China, from May 2005 to July 2007. Nose and throat swab samples from 5808 ARTI patients were analysed by PCR methods for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (IFVs) A, B, and C, parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1-4, enteroviruses (EVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human coronaviruses (HCoVs) OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1, and adenoviruses (ADVs). Viral pathogens were detected in 34.6% of patient samples, and 1.6% of the patients tested positive for more than one virus. IFVs (19.3%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by HRVs (6.5%), PIVs (4.3%), EVs (3.2%), and HCoVs (1.1%). ADVs, RSV and HMPV were also detected (<1%). The viral detection rates differed significantly between infections of the lower and upper respiratory tracts in the sample population: PIVs, the second most commonly detected viral agents in lower acute respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), were more prevalent than in upper acute respiratory tract infections, indicating that the pathogenic role of PIVs in LRTIs should be investigated. Currently, this study is the largest-scale investigation of respiratory virus infections in China with multiple agent detection, providing baseline data for further studies of respiratory virus infections in adults with ARTIs.",

            "text": "Viruses are among the major causes of acute respiratory tract illnesses (ARTIs) throughout the world. The most common viruses responsible for ARTIs include influenza viruses (IFVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1-4, enteroviruses (EVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), adenoviruses (ADVs), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E and OC43 [1] [2] [3] [4] . Improvements in molecular detection techniques have resulted in the recent identifica-tion of several new respiratory viruses [5] . Recently discovered viruses such as human metapneumovirus (HMPV), novel strains of coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HKU1), human bocavirus and novel polyomaviruses (WU and KI) have been detected around the world [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . The illness and mortality due to respiratory viruses have made viral ARTIs a top priority in the global health challenge. As vaccination is currently unavailable for most of these viruses, it is necessary to monitor epidemic patterns and investigate the spread of respiratory virus infections to efficiently identify, control and prevent future epidemics. Viral emergence varies from season to season, year to year, and region to region [15] . The risk of respiratory virus infection correlates with age, pre-existing medical condition, and immune status [16, 17] . Most studies of respiratory viral activity patterns have focused on children, and large-scale epidemiological investigations of respiratory virus infections in adults have rarely been conducted. In an attempt to \u00aa2009 Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences characterize the respiratory virus infections and to provide insights into the aetiology and clinical associations of respiratory viruses in adult ARTIs, a 2-year study was conducted with adults suspected of having ARTIs in Beijing, China.",

Briefly, two multiplex nested RT-PCRs were used for the simultaneous detection of PIVs 1-4, EVs, and HRVs, as well as IFVs A, B, and C, and RSVs A, and B. In addition, two one-step RT-PCRs were used to detect HCoVs and HMPV. ADVs were detected by one-step PCR. The sensitivity of the PCR systems was determined by using cloned, amplified products of each type of virus. Blank VTM was used as a negative control, and 100 copies of invariant b-actin gene were added to lysis buffer as internal controls to exclude inhibitors for nucleic acid extraction and PCR. Each RT-PCR amplification was performed using the SuperScript II One-Step RT-PCR Platinum Taq kit (Invitrogen), and ExTaq DNA polymerase (Takara) was used for PCR assays. PCR products were analysed by electropho-resis in 2% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. Of the PCR-positive samples, half were randomly selected for verification by PCR product sequencing.",

In this study, multiple viral agents, including IFVs A, B, and C, RSV, PIVs 1-4, HRVs, EVs, HCoVs (229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1), HMPV, and ADVs, were analysed in a large population, with the goal of providing comprehensive data for viral infection in adults with ARTIs. To our knowledge, this is the largestscale investigation of respiratory virus infections in China in adults with ARTIs. The overall detection rate of respiratory viruses in this study was 34.6%, similar to those obtained by others [2, 3] . However, these results may underestimate the role of virus infection, because viral loads in nose and throat swabs, as used in this study, are usually lower than those in [23] . Furthermore, infections from as yet unknown viruses may be responsible for some ARTIs. The prevalence of bacterial ARTI was not investigated in this study. Some of the tested known viruses, such as HRVs and RSV, were detected at lower rates than those reported by other investigators [24, 25] . There are multiple explanations for these differences. First, detection methods differ from one study to another. It is difficult to compare the results, as the reported data were obtained with different detection methods or PCR primers [2, 24] . Future comparative studies to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of these detection methods should clarify this issue. Second, the infection rates may vary with geographical location, and with the particular period chosen for testing [15, 24] .",

These data conform previously published data on respiratory infections in an Australian population, where a similar age distribution was reported [2] . As expected, IFVs were the most common agents detected throughout the year. An epidemic of IFVA usually occurs in the winter, and rarely in the summer, in temperate zones [2, 3] . However, during the study period, an epidemic peak of IFV A infection was observed in the summer of 2006. More patients with influenza-like illness were observed during this period, reflected by a two-fold increase in visits to the FOCD. The reason for this epidemic is unclear. We speculate that it may be due to antigen drift of IFVA, but this hypothesis needs to be confirmed by haemagglutinin sequencing in future studies. Currently influenza surveillance in north China is mainly conducted between late autumn and early spring (from 1 October to 31 March of the following year), and our findings indicate the necessity to extend the surveillance period of IFV to the entire year.",
