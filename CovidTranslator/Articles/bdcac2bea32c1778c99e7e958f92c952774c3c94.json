            "text": "In the subset of patients with PCNSL transplanted in CR1, data may be even more favorable, with our institution reporting a 2-year PFS and OS rate of 95.2% (95% CI 86.6-100). These results mimic data obtained in DeFillip et al which noted a PFS and OS of 92% and 95% at 2 years for PCNSL patients transplanted in CR1. 17 40, 41 However, both of these studies included patients with active CNS disease which is known to have poorer outcomes than those with CNS lymphoma in remission. 39, 42 Indeed, all patients with SCNSL/CNS relapse in our study and in both Chen and Qualls et al were transplanted while in CR, which is likely contributing to the favorable survival outcomes. 15, 37 One concern with the TBC regimen is non-hematologic toxicity. The most common therapyrelated toxicities noted in most studies using this regimen are febrile neutropenia, mucositis, and diarrhea. 14, 15, 18 Our study also noted a high rate of nausea/vomiting and electrolyte abnormalities. The incidence of septic complications with TBC conditioning appears to be higher than with other conditioning regimens and has also led to higher rates of treatment-related mortality. We report a TRM rate of 8.3% (all from septic complications) and other institutions have reported a range of 0-14.3% with TBC conditioning in PCNSL patients. 8, 15, 18, 43 The reason for this increased toxicity is not clear. While some studies have found age > 60 years to be a factor, 8 others found no association. 18 Scordo et al hypothesized that the high TRM rate may be secondary to busulfan if levels are above therapeutic range, but then found that patients with elevated first-dose busulfan area under the curve values did not experience more toxicity. 18 Given that CNS penetration of cyclophosphamide is much lower (<30%) than what can be achieved with thiotepa and busulfan, 33 year EFS was 45% 11 and a long-term follow-up study showed an overall survival of 35%. 12 They noted a higher relapse rate (4 patients, 25%) than other studies with TBC conditioning 14, 15 and also a high TRM (2 patients, 12.5%). 11 Neurotoxicity occurred in 88.9% of patients who received WBRT, although no cases were reported among patients who underwent ASCT without previous WBRT. Therefore, the data thus far shows no superior outcomes with the removal of cyclophosphamide from TBC conditioning. However, given that only one study has examined thiotepa and busulfan alone and its small sample size of only 16 patients, the true benefit of cyclophosphamide remains undetermined.",

            "text": "An alternative option for a CNS-directed conditioning regimen is the combination of carmustine and thiotepa. Carmustine is another agent with substantial CNS penetration (15-70%), though not as high as busulfan. 33 Two studies by Illerhaus et al evaluated this conditioning regimen with favorable results. One study reported a PFS and OS rate of 83% at 5 years 21, 22 and the second study reported a projected PFS of 73% and OS of 82% at 5 years. 7, 24 Both studies reported no TRM making this regimen another promising treatment option. As discussed in further detail below, this conditioning regimen was also evaluated in the randomized study IELSG32 which reported a 2-year OS of 77% and a TRM of 3%. 44 A meta-analysis of HDC/ASCT for PCNSL found carmustine/thiotepa to be the conditioning regimen with the lowest risk of TRM, but the TBC regimen to have numerically superior PFS and OS rates. 45 Neurotoxicity appears to be less common with HDC/ASCT than with WBRT consolidation. We report a rate of 27.1% for reversible neurotoxicity, most commonly consisting of delirium and rarely seizure (4.2%). Scordo et al reported a similar finding of neurotoxicity in 10% of patients (including delirium, seizure, anxiety/depression, neuropathy, syncope, headache, and mania) who underwent HDC/ASCT. 18 Long-term neurotoxic effects were not evaluated in our study but other reports have documented some delayed effects. 15, 17 However, the rates of long-term neurotoxic effects appear to be lower than that with WBRT, which has been reported as 24% 5- year cumulative incidence of neurotoxicity. 3, 4, 46, 47 Our study has several limitations, including the limited sample size and retrospective nature of the study. Although we do not have precise data on the number of patients that did not receive HDC/ASCT, the vast majority of patients with these diagnoses in whom we initiated therapy did ultimately undergo transplant. In our experience it was rare for patients with these diagnoses to not be candidates for stem cell transplant after receiving induction or salvage therapy once they achieved best response. Additionally, while PCNSL patients transplanted in CR1 received a uniform induction regimen, the patients with refractory or relapsed PCNSL and SCNSL/CNS received heterogeneous induction and salvage therapies ( Table 2 ) making definitive conclusions on the efficacy of HDC/ASCT in this cohort of patients difficult. Finally, toxicity evaluation was not recorded according to CTCAE or objective scoring systems and were arbitrarily defined using chart review. The long-term neurotoxic effects and minimal residual disease status were also not evaluated.",

However, OS after 4 years was similar in both arms (66% versus 64%). TRM was higher in the HDC/ASCT group (5 deaths versus 1 death in WBRT group). Cognitive impairment was documented after WBRT, but cognitive functions improved or remained stable after HDC/ASCT. 49 The IELSG32 trial compared WBRT (n = 55 patients) versus ASCT (n = 58 patients) with carmustine/thiotepa conditioning for consolidation and showed similar 2-year PFS (76% after WBRT versus 75% 19 after ASCT, p = 0.62). and 2-year OS (82% after WBRT versus 77% after ASCT, p = 0.91). 44 TRM was 3% in the ASCT group and there was a non-significant trend towards impaired attention and executive functions 2 years after therapy of those given WBRT. 44 For nonmyeloablative chemotherapy, two trials are in process. The CALBG 51101 trial will compare dose-intensive etoposide and cytarabine chemotherapy with HDC/ASCT using carmustine and thiotepa conditioning, 32,50 and the European MATRIX/IELSG43 will compare consolidation chemotherapy consisting of rituximab, dexamethasone, etoposide, ifosfamide, and carboplatin (R-DeVIC) with HDC/ASCT using thiotepa and carmustine conditioning. 32 There is also data on the use of novel agents targeting components of the B-cell receptor pathway, namely the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib, and immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide. 51 These agents have promising high response rates but currently have only been trialed in the salvage setting. 52",

This data is not surprising given the clear survival benefit and lower relapse rates for patients in complete response prior to ASCT in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 35,36 Among SCNSL and CNS relapsed NHL patients undergoing ASCT with TBC conditioning, the 2-year PFS and OS rates in our study were 75.9% (59.5-96.8) and 75.3% (58.6-96.8), respectively. This is equivalent or superior to results in other studies and compares favorably to results in patients with relapsed/refractory PCNSL and intraocular lymphoma. 20 In a subset analysis of 12 patients with SCNSL who underwent HDC/ASCT also with TBC conditioning, Chen et al reported a 2-year PFS and OS of 51% (95% CI 18-77) and 83% (95% CI 48-96).

In fact, Maziarz et al conducted a large analysis of 151 patients and noted comparable long-term outcomes for NHL patients with and without CNS involvement who underwent ASCT. 39 Other studies have reported less impressive results with a noted EFS rate of 46% + 26% and OS rate of 41% + 28% at 5 years (Alvarnas et al) for 13 patients with SCNSL undergoing HDC/ASCT with carmustine, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide conditioning and a disease-free survival (DFS) rate of 23% + 19% at 2 years (van Besien et al) for 24 patients with SCNSL undergoing HDC/ASCT with TBC conditioning.",
