TGEV causes symptoms of gastroenteritis in swine, a condition associated with high morbidity in animals of all ages and high mortality in suckling piglets (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2004) . The appearance of a porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), which is antigenically related to TGEV, has strongly decreased the risk of TGE in Europe, since neutralizing antibodies elicited by PRCV can provide cross-protection against TGEV infection. However, TGEV prevalence is still reported in different parts of the world, implying that TGEV is still threatening pig industry. As no safe and fully protective TGEV vaccine exists, an effective treatment of the disease in piglets is needed (Ren et al., 2011) .",

However, the underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown. We investigated the effects of the two zinc salts, zinc chloride (ZnCl 2 ) and zinc sulfate (ZnSO 4 ), on infection of swine testicle (ST) cells with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and compared it to the effects of a control salt, magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ). Virus yield reduction experiments showed that ZnCl 2 and ZnSO 4 did not exhibit direct virucidal effects and did not affect adsorption of TGEV to ST cells. However, ZnCl 2 and ZnSO 4 markedly reduced viral titers as well as TGEV RNA and viral protein synthesis when applied during virus penetration and at different time points after viral cell entry. The results of the study suggest that zinc salts do not interfere with TGEV-cell binding but that they mediate antiviral effects through inhibition of viral penetration or egress or the intracellular phase of the viral life-cycle.",

When added at an early stage of infection (1-4 hpi), Zn might partly block or delay the initial cell entry of TGEV, which is mediated through receptor mediated endocytosis and acid dependent fusion (Schwegmann-Wessels et al., 2002) . The same could be valid for the entry of newly produced virus, when Zn is added in a later stage of infection (22-24 hpi) after multiple replication cycles. Additionally or alternatively, Zn could also impair stages of viral replication that follow the release of TGEV into the cytoplasm. A possible intracellular target for Zn-mediated inhibition is the viral RNA polymerase which was reportedly inhibited by increasing intracellular Zn ions in case of the SARS-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other viruses (te Velthuis et al., 2010) . In our study, the relative amount of viral Sprotein RNA detectable in infected cells was significantly reduced by Zn treatment for 1-4 hpi without previous inhibition of virus penetration as shown in Fig. 2 . In case of ZnCl 2 treatment, the reduction was more than 40-fold and in case of ZnSO 4 it was more than 16-fold compared to the viral RNA levels in the untreated wells. We also found the relative amount of viral proteins released from infected cells to be reduced by more than 40% for the early-stage treatment without previous inhibition of virus penetration (Fig. 3) . This reduction of viral proteins could be a result of the inhibition of previous stages of viral replication, but again there is also evidence that Zn could directly inhibit the proteolytic cleavage of viral polypeptides (Korant and Butterworth, 1976) . Potential points of action against TGEV might be a chymotrypsin-like protease that is responsible for the cleavage of polyproteins into functional proteins, and which is highly conserved in coronaviruses (Kuo et al., 2009) , or a papain-like protease which, in case of the SARS-CoV, was shown to be potently inhibited by Zn ions (Han et al., 2005) .",

Presumably the repeated inhibition of one or more viral replication steps could potentiate the antiviral effects of Zn treatment. The observation that the virus yield reduction achieved with the long-term treatment did not reach the potential amount of the combined early and late shortterm treatment, however, might be explained by the fact that the long-term treatment was initiated without prior inhibition of initial virus penetration as is was the case with the early short-term treatment (1-4 hpi), so that this initial reduction is missing.",
