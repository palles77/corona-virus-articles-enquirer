            "text": "Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) has been extensively utilized as a viral vector system for the induction of protective immune responses against a variety of pathogens. We constructed recombinant VSVs specifying either the Indiana or Chandipura virus G glycoprotein and expressing the West Nile virus (WNV) envelope (E) glycoprotein. Mice were intranasally vaccinated using a prime (Indiana)-boost (Chandipura) immunization approach and challenged with the virulent WNV-LSU-AR01. Ninety-percent (9 of 10) of the vaccinated mice survived as compared to 10% of the mock-vaccinated mice after WNV lethal challenge. Histopathological examination of brain tissues revealed neuronal necrosis in mock-vaccinated mice but not in vaccinated mice, and vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice developed a strong neutralizing antibody response against WNV. Extensive immunological analysis using polychromatic flow cytometry staining revealed that vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice developed robust cellular immune responses as evidenced by up-regulation of CD4 + CD154 + IFN\u2425 + T cells in vaccinated, but not mock-vaccinated mice. Similarly, vaccinated mice developed robust E-glycoprotein-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses as evidenced by the presence of a high percentage of CD8 + CD62L low IFN\u2425 + cells. In addition, a sizeable population of CD8 + CD69 + cells was detected indicating E-specific activation of mature T cells and CD4 + CD25 + CD127 low T regulatory (T reg) cells were down-regulated. These results suggest that VSV-vectored vaccines administered intranasally can efficiently induce protective humoral and cellular immune responses against WNV infections.",

The lipid-bilayer membrane of the nascent virus contains 180 molecules of the envelope (E) and premembrane (preM) proteins organized into 60 asymmetric non-neurological clinical manifestations include rhabdomyolysis [22, 23] , pancreatitis [24] , hepatitis [25] , myositis, orchitis [26] , chorioretinitis [27] and cardiac dysrhythmias [28] . Typically, less than 1% of patients suffer from West Nile neuroinvasive disease (WND) including West Nile meningitis (WNM), encephalitis (WNE) and acute flaccid paralysis (poliomyelitis-like syndrome, WNP) [29] . Among WND cases, an estimated 55-60% of the patients had WNE resulting in an estimated 20% case fatality. Additionally, 10-50% of mortalities in humans could be attributed to WNP [29] .",

A variety of different approaches have been employed to produce WNV vaccines including inactivated virus, subunit and DNA-based vaccines. Most of these vaccines appeared to be highly immunogenic, and in some cases protected against WNV-infection in experimental animals [30] . Recently, recombinant viruses expressing WNV antigens have been shown to induce strong immune responses and protection against WNV challenge in animals. Specifically, a recombinant live canarypox-vectored vaccine expressing the preM protein and the E glycoprotein induced strong immune responses in horses and cats [31] [32] [33] [34] , that appeared to be partially protective [35] . Other viral-vectored vaccines that elicited protective immune responses in mice include a lentivirus vector based vaccine (TRIP/sE WNV ) [36] , and a measles virus-vectored vaccine [37] . Recombinant yellow fever virus (YFV) has also been used to express WNV preM and E proteins based on the extensive safety record of the YFV attenuated vaccine [38, 39] . A YFV recombinant vaccine (ChimeriVax TM ) has shown good immune responses in hamster, mice, non-human primates and humans [40] [41] [42] . A Phase II clinical trial with ChimeriVax TM -WNV is currently underway [43] .",

VSV infectious viruses can be efficiently recovered by a reverse genetic approach that utilizes multiple plasmids expressing VSV genes. This methodology has enabled the rapid construction of recombinant VSV viruses expressing a variety of viral and bacterial antigens for vaccine purposes including influenza virus, bovine diarrhea virus, cotton-tail papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C, measles virus, Ebola virus, Lassa fever virus, Marburg virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARS), and herpes simplex type-2 virus [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Recombinant VSVs have been also constructed and tested as vaccines for bacterial pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Yersinia pestis [64, 65] . VSV-vectored vaccines have been administered via intranasal, intramuscular and subcutaneous routes and have been shown to elicit robust mucosal and systemic humoral and cellular immune responses [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [66] [67] [68] .",

VSV infects animals via transmucosal and transcutaneous routes [77] . VSV may also be transmitted through sandflies, blackflies and mosquitoes [44, 78] . The VSV G glycoprotein is a potent immunogen and also serves important functions in virus-entry and virus-induced cell fusion [79] . Recombinant VSVs expressing a variety of viral and bacterial antigens have been constructed. Vaccine studies with these recombinant VSVs have showed that intranasal and intramuscular administration of the rVSVs were safe and efficient in inducing protective humoral and cellular immune responses against a variety of pathogens [78] . Of particular interest is the ability of the VSV-vector system to elicit strong humoral and cellular immune responses via the intranasal route [48, 49, 59, 60, 65, 80] that can be substantially easier to administer than intramuscularly injected vaccines. In these vaccine studies, although the \"empty\" VSV vector elicited robust humoral and cellular immune responses against VSV, these responses did not contribute to protection against a variety of pathogens indicating that specific immune responses against the expressed transgene were primarily responsible for protection [49, [58] [59] [60] 81, 82] .",

This pair of rVSVs was used in a prime-boost-vaccination approach to maximize humoral immune responses against the WNV-E glycoprotein expressed by both viruses, while minimizing the anamnestic immune response against the VSV vector targeted predominantly against the G glycoprotein. This is largely accomplished because the Chandipura G and the VSV-Indiana G glycoproteins are approximately 60% different in their amino acid sequences [83] . Recombinant VSVs are known to non-specifically incorporate certain other viral and cellular glycoproteins into their virions without adversely affecting viral infectivity [70] . The insertion of the foreign E gene into the VSV genome did not adversely affect viral replication and infectivity, because rVSV containing the E gene replicated to similar titers with those of the VSV control virus that did not have a foreign gene inserted within their genomes (not shown). Moreover, rVSV-E isolates were stable, since multiple serial passages of virus stocks in BHK cells did not affect E glycoprotein expression and genomic stability (not shown). Although it is unclear whether the WNV E glycoprotein is inserted into VSV envelopes, these results suggested that rVSV-E were stable retaining wild-type levels of viral replication and infectivity. Recombinant VSV-E expressed WNV-E glycoprotein to high levels in BHK cells and the expressed E glycoprotein appeared to be fully glycosylated as evidenced by the apparent molecular mass of approximately 53-55 kDa in SDS-PAGE in agreement with published reports [33, 73] .",

This prime-boost-vaccination approach resulted in 90% (9 of 10) of the mice surviving lethal challenge with the WNV-LSU-AR01 virulent strain. The single mouse from the vaccinated group of mice that died late in the experiment (12 days post-challenge) appeared to die from WNV-unrelated causes, since histopathological examination showed severe suppurative rhinitis but no histological abnormality in the brain. Therefore, the rVSV-E prime-boost intranasal vaccination protocol was highly efficacious in protecting mice against WNV infection. Similar results were obtained in a different experiment in which mice were vaccinated via the intramuscular route and challenged with WNV-NY99 strain instead of the LSU-AR01 9 weeks post-boost. In this experiment 70% of the mice survived indicating that intramuscular immunization may also provide protective immune responses against WNV infection.",

The specificity of this response is not discernable, since it may be due to either or both VSV and WNV antigens. However, strong neutralizing antibody titers were also produced against WNV indicating the induction of Especific humoral immune responses. This result is in agreement with previous reports showing that other VSV-vectored vaccines induced strong humoral immune responses against different VSVexpressed antigens. Specifically, recombinant VSVs expressing either the respiratory syncytial virus F glycoprotein [49] , or rVSV expressing the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) corona virus (SARS-CoV) produced high antibody titers against the F glycoprotein and SARC-CoV spike (S) glycoprotein, while strong immune responses against the VSV virus was noted [59] .",

            "text": "The WNV E glycoprotein contains multiple predicted and experimentally verified cytotoxic T cell (CTL) epitopes [87] [88] [89] [90] . The availability of a library of overlapping peptides derived from the WNV E glycoprotein allowed the elucidation of antigen-specific cellular immune responses. Peptide pool 1 composed of the first 34 peptides averaging 12-18 amino acids each generated stronger cellular CD8 + IFN\u2425 + T cell responses in in vitro proliferation assays, in comparison to peptide pool 2, which represented the carboxyl terminus-half of the WNV E glycoprotein. Peptide pool 1 contains the experimentally verified CTL epitope RSYCYLAT (E 347-354) while peptide pool 2 contains the CTL epitope IALTFLAV (E771-778), both of which have been shown to confer protection against lethal WNV-challenge in mice [87, 89] . In vitro stimulation of lymphocytes from vaccinated mice revealed the presence of antigen-specific IFN\u2425 responses specifically in CD8 + CD62L low T cells. CD62L (Lselectin) mediates adhesion of resting lymphocytes to peripheral lymph nodes. Typically, high expression of CD62L (CD62L hi ) reveals entrapment of lymphocytes within lymph nodes, while low CD62L (CD62L low ) cell-surface expression (the result of T cell activation) is indicative of lymphocyte extravasation to sites of inflammation [91] . Splenocytes from vaccinated mice had significantly lower expression of the CD62L marker on E-specific IFN\u2425 + CD8 + T cells revealing activation and extravasation of these cells to peripheral sites, potentially involved in killing virus-infected cells prior to transmission to the CNS. CD69 is an early activation marker that is absent in resting lymphocytes [75] . The up-regulation of the CD8 + CD69 + E-specific T cell responses in vaccinated versus mock-vaccinated mice provides additional evidence for the stimulation of T cells. Accordingly, CD8 + CD69 + E-specific population of T cells was up-regulated in vaccinated versus mock-vaccinated mice indicating the generation of activated memory CD8 + T cells. It is unclear whether the observed CD8 + T cell memory responses confer long-term immunity against WNV infection. T regs are known to play important roles in down-regulation of anti-self immune responses [92] , and to suppress proliferation and cytokine production of effector T cells [93] . Typically, during viral infections, up-regulation of humoral and cellular immune responses causes down-regulation of T reg activation. Typically, T regs express the FoxP3 and CD25 markers. The IL-7 receptor CD127 marker expression is inversely correlated to FoxP3 expression and CD127 low CD25 + cells have been shown to be positive for FoxP3 [93, 94] . Consequently, the CD25 + CD127 low population was used to define T regs. As expected, there was a negative correlation between the relative population of T reg cells (CD4 + CD25 + CD127 low ) and antigen-specific CTL responses in the vaccinated mice. However, the specificity of this immune response cannot be discerned, since it most likely is caused by both VSV and E glycoprotein antigens.",

The relative role of humoral versus cellular immune responses has been extensively debated in the literature. Certain studies have suggested that a strong humoral immune response evidenced by the production of high titer anti-WNV titers is necessary and sufficient to protect mice from CNS infection, while other reports have argued that a cellular immune response characterized by a robust anti-WNV CD8 + T cell responses is necessary for protecting and clearing brain tissues from WNV [89, 95, 96] . One report has argued that CTL-immune responses may result in exacerbated immunopathology in brain and CNS tissues at infections with low WNV titers (10 3 PFU) [95] . In our experiments, 10 5 WNV PFU were inoculated intraperitoneally. Vaccinated mice had no evidence of neuronal necrosis suggesting the CD8 + T cell responses conferred protection and virus clearance. It is probable that both humoral and cellular immune responses generated against the WNV E glycoprotein prevented the virus from entering CNS, potentially arresting the virus at peripheral sites. Alternatively, if some virus escaped peripheral immune surveillance, it is possible that CTLs cleared the virus from brain tissues before it could cause significant damage and resultant immunopathological manifestations.",

Intranasal vaccination is second only to oral vaccination with regard to the relative ease of administration and patient compliance issues rendering this approach attractive for human use. Recently, single-cycle VSVvectored vaccines have been shown to generate robust immune responses against a number of viral pathogens including HIV, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, influenza, avian influenza, hepatitis C and RSV viruses [46, 47, 49, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] 81, 97] . Based on these results, it is expected that single cycle VSV-WNV vaccines would be also efficacious. Additional improvements in attenuating VSV can be made by providing more than one viral protein in trans through complementing cells, as well as engineering additional mutations that are known to attenuate VSV.",
