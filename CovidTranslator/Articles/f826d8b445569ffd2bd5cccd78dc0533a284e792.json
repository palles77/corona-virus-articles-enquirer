DAVID analysis yielded 12 highly enriched clusters (EASE score above 1) and 17 clusters in total. We next generated a combined network view based on STRING database interactions and DAVID functional annotation clustering using a Matlab script described in (Mercer et al., 2012) and Cytoscape for visualization. Briefly, we used STRING 9.1 (http://www.string-db.org) to generate interaction networks of significant SILAC hits with a 2.1-fold or stronger dynamic CD81 interaction (Franceschini et al., 2013) . Then, each protein was assigned to the cluster with the highest enrichment, in which the protein was present in the highest fraction of individual annotations. Selected unclustered proteins were placed back in the visualization as inverted arrowheads. All STRING interactions (solid lines) with a confidence score of 0.9 or higher, and all interactions of 0.35 or higher between genes within the same functional annotation cluster were added. Finally, we manually placed functional annotation clusters in their approximate cellular locations. Selected proteins with two cellular locations were placed into both respective places (see Figure 1F ).",

The quantitative proteomics methodology described here is suited to reveal transient host factor -receptor interactions during pathogen entry. Briefly, susceptible cells are incubated with a pathogen or left untreated; then pathogen receptors are affinity enriched and differential receptor binding partners identified and analyzed for their functional role by RNAi. The strategy allows the identification of signaling pathways leading to cellular reprogramming like e.g. apoptosis, host factors for productive infection and innate immune sensing pathways.
