For simultaneous detection of CDV and CCoV, a sensitive and specific one-step duplex PCR (one-step dPCR) assay was developed with two pairs of primers that were designed based on H and M gene sequences of CDV and CCoV, respectively. The one-step dPCR with optimized detection conditions has high specificity and sensitivity; independent sequencing assays further verified these results.",

            "text": "Canine distemper virus (CDV) is the etiological agent of a serious and often fatal disease in dogs and many other carnivores. CDV was first isolated in 1905 and for decades was responsible for large numbers of animal deaths worldwide [1] . Although attenuated vaccines considerably reduced mortality rates and have partially controlled the disease in the last years, several outbreaks of CDV are still reported in dogs and wildlife hosts [2, 3] . CDV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome, encoding six structural and two nonstructural proteins. Two surface glycoproteins, namely the Haemagglutinin (H) and Fusion protein (F), play key roles in virus attachment and entry into host cells; in addition they are the main targets for the immune response as well. The glycosylated H protein mediates receptor binding and is much more variable than other CDV proteins, which renders it a suitable target for investigating CDV genetic/antigenic diversity [4] . The analysis of CDV strains has revealed pronounced genetic diversity of the H gene, with eleven main geographicallydistinct lineages (genotypes) described [4, 5] .",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses which infect humans and a variety of nonprimate mammals, including canines [6] . Canine coronavirus (CCoV) was first recognized as an enteric pathogen of dogs in 1971 [7] . CCoV is a common pathogen of dog populations, particularly those housed in large groups [8] [9] [10] . In some cases, CCoV infection can be fatal in young dogs, in particular when coinfected with CDV or other intestinal pathogens [11] . In recent years, an increasing number of highly virulent CCoV infections have also been documented in Europe [12] [13] [14] . CCoV particles are composed of four major structural proteins termed spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) [15] . The M protein, the most abundant structural component, is a type III glycoprotein that induces antibody-dependent, complement-mediated, viral neutralization [16, 17] . CDV serological tests, but these methods either have a low level of sensitivity and specificity, a long diagnostic period [3] , or depend on expensive imported reagents. Therefore, it is urgent to establish a rapid, simple and accurate method to rapidly detect both CDV and CCoV allowing early diagnosis, epidemic monitoring and epidemiological investigation of canine diarrhea. The objective of this study was to establish a new one-step dPCR assay for CDV and CCoV diagnosis in surveillance studies. This assay has been evaluated using samples from canine sera, in order to demonstrate its value for detecting CDV and CCoV in an animal hospital. It is necessary to establish rapid early diagnostic methods to allow effective control measures to be implemented as soon as possible and reduce the harm caused by these diseases to the dog industry.",

Serum samples were collected in 2014 or 2015 from dogs with symptoms of fever, coughing, vomiting, diarrhea, ataxia, and paralysis. Samples were homogenized and centrifuged at 3000\u00d7g for 15 min to obtain a cell-free supernatant, and the supernatant was directly added to the tube as a template for one-step dPCR. An independent sequencing assay was used to evaluate the one-step duplex PCR assay. The results are shown in Table 2 . Among the 173 clinical specimens, 23 specimens displayed a single infection with CDV; 20 specimens displayed a single infection with CCoV and 13 specimens displayed co-infection with CDV and CCoV. A prevalence (28.08%) of diarrheic dogs, shown to harbor at least one pathogen by one-step dPCR, was observed in the Beijng samples, which exceeded those in the Anhui (20.45%) and Shanxi (17.5%) samples, as shown in Table 2 . At the same time, the samples were analyzed by conventional duplex RT-PCR. The results were consistent with one-step dPCR. This independent assay confirmed the one-step duplex PCR results (100% match), including DNA sequencing verification, indicating a high specificity for the one-step duplex PCR assay. The prevalence of coinfection we observed in diarrheic dogs (10.11%) in Beijing was also higher than those in the other cities tested. Despite the higher prevalence of entero-pathogens and co-infections in Beijing, the rates in the other countries are also relevant, indicating that infectious diarrhea may be a national phenomenon rather than a phenomenon specific to a particular city.",

Moreover, Sensitivity of the one-step dPCR assay (A) and conventional dPCR assay (B) using different CDV RNA and CCoV RNA dilutions. M: DL2000 marker; 1-6: CDV RNA concentrations ranging from 1.5 \u00d7 10 0 \u03bcg/mL to 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22125 \u03bcg/mL, CCoV RNA concentrations ranging from 2.1 \u00d7 10 0 \u03bcg/mL to 2.1 \u00d7 10 \u22125 \u03bcg/mLL; 7: Negative control real-time quantitative PCR is currently available for the diagnosis of CDV or CCoV. However, it is rarely reported to detect CDV and CCoV, simultaneously. The occurrence of false-positive PCR products for each of these methods hinders the identification of wild-type CDV strains [18] . Real-time quantitative PCR methods have also been reported to detect CDV or CCoV. The advantages of realtime PCR, compared with conventional RT-PCR, include a higher speed, greater sensitivity, and less handling of PCR products. However, real-time PCR instruments are expensive and may not be readily available in many laboratories [19] . Other methods such as serological assays (indirect immunofluorescence assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), virus isolation and in situ hybridization have also been developed, but are not applicable for the fast and sensitive diagnosis of CDV or CCoV [20] [21] [22] . The one-step PCR detection assay is an innovative PCR detection method, eliminating the nucleic acid extraction step, with the samples being directly added into the PCR reagents for testing.",
