We therefore investigated the effect of MDL 28170, a potent calpain inhibitor, on the growth of Leishmania amazonensis. After 48 h of treatment, the inhibitor exhibited a dose-dependent antileishmanial activity, with a 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ) of 23.3 M. The inhibitor promoted cellular alterations, such as the parasites becoming short and round. A calpain-like protein migrating at 80 kDa was identified by Western blotting. In addition, the calpain-like molecules were identified on the cell surface of the flagellate. These results add new in vitro insights into the exploitation of calpain inhibitors in treating parasitic infections and add this family of peptidases to the list of potential targets for development of more potent and specific inhibitors against trypanosomatids.",

Although Leishmania is hypoendemic in most of the 88 endemic countries, up to 40% of the population in these countries produces a Leishmania-positive skin test in rural endemic areas, illustrating that contact with the parasite is much more widespread than previously thought [1] . The frequency of subclinical cases is well documented for humans and mammalian reservoirs. Indeed, in Brazil the incidence of subclinical cases of leishmaniasis is 10-fold or more higher than the incidence of clinical cases. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) can increase the risk of developing leishmaniasis by 100-1000-fold [2] . In addition, visceralisation of Leishmania strains such as Leishmania amazonensis that are classically restricted to cutaneous leishmaniasis has often been observed in patients with Leishmania-HIV co-infection [3] . Clinical reports indicate * Corresponding author. Tel.: +55 that a large proportion of cases are becoming unresponsive to chemotherapy [1, 2] .",

Undoubtely one such disease is leishmaniasis. Pentavalent antimonial drugs, such as antimonials, sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate, are still the first-line treatment for leishmaniasis in most affected areas, with amphotericin B and pentamidine being used as alternative drugs. These agents are expensive, not active orally, require long-term parenteral administration and produce serious side effects (e.g. cardiac and renal toxicity); moreover, resistance to these compounds has become a severe problem.

Analysis of proteolytic enzymes of pathogenic organisms might lead to the design of powerful chemotherapeutic agents against these pathogens [5, 6] . In this context, calpain inhibitors appear an interesting alternative. Calpain is a calcium-regulated cytosolic cysteine peptidase that exists in two major isoforms, m-calpain and -calpain, which require millimolar and micromolar concentrations of Ca 2+ , respectively, for their activation [7] . The role of calpain remains poorly understood, but it may be involved in crucial cellular functions such as rearrangement of cytoskeletal proteins and protein cleavage to activate various receptors and pro-enzymes. Calpain activation in humans appears to be increased during normal aging and in muscular dystrophy, cataract, arthritis and Alzheimer's disease, as well as in acute traumas including traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury and cerebral and cardiac ischaemia. A variety of calpain inhibitors are under development and the potential clinical utility of these inhibitors has been shown in treating Alzheimer's disease [8] and in minimising neuronal death after ischaemia [9] . In addition, these inhibitors are a promising alternative for treating severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARSCoV) [10] and adenovirus [11] and may be effective in inhibiting the activation of HIV in latently infected cells [12] . Therefore, these compounds or analogues deserve evaluation as potential therapies for treating leishmaniasis, or could be used as lead compounds for discovery of a more potent Leishmania inhibitor. In this context, we have investigated the inhibitory capability of a potent calpain inhibitor, MDL 28170, against L. amazonensis, aiming to show its effects on the growth and morphology of the parasite. In addition, we have demonstrated the presence of calpain homologues in L. amazonensis by Western blotting, flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analyses.",

Briefly, promastigotes were counted using a Neubauer chamber and re-suspended in fresh medium to a final concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 10 6 viable promastigotes/mL. Viability was assessed by mobility and lack of staining after challenge with trypan blue. The inhibitor compound was added to the culture at final concentrations of 15, 20, 25 and 30 M (starting from a 5 mM solution in DMSO that was serially diluted in culture medium). Dilutions of DMSO corresponding to those used to prepare the drug solutions were assessed in parallel. After 24, 48, 72 and 96 h incubation at 26 \u2022 C, the number of viable motile promastigotes was quantified daily by counting the flagellates in a Neubauer chamber. Alternatively, parasites grown for 72 h in the absence and presence of the calpain inhibitor were washed five times in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) prior to re-suspension in drug-free fresh medium and allowed to grow for another 72 h to evaluate the leishmanicidal or leishmanistatic effect. The number of live promastigotes was evaluated as well as cell morphology under optical microscopy at 24-h intervals [14] . The 50% lethal dose (LD 50 ), i.e. the drug concentration that caused a 50% reduction in survival/viability in comparison with that in identical cultures without the compound, was evaluated after 48 h. This value was determined by non-linear regression analysis by plotting the number of viable promastigotes versus log drug concentration using Origin Pro 7.5 computer software.",

No common epitopes were found between mammalian calpains and L. amazonensis polypeptides (Fig. 3, lanes b-d) . Lysates of mouse liver were recognised by anti-C21, anti-C23, anti-C24 and anti-Dm-calpain antibodies (data not shown). The calpain-like molecule was detected on the cell surface of L. amazonensis, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy analyses using the anti-Dm-calpain antibody (Figs 4 and 5) . The immunofluorescence image showed labelling throughout the cell surface, including the flagellum.

Fluorescence microscopy showing labelling of Leishmania amazonensis with anti-Dm-calpain antibodies. Experimental systems were analysed under differential interferential contrast images (a, c) and immunofluorescence (b, d). The bar represents 1 m. expressed in procyclics but not in bloodstream trypomastigotes. Furthermore, the protein probably possesses a stable interaction with the cell membrane, suggesting a function in cellular remodelling [20] . In C. deanei, the calpain-related molecule was shown to be proteolytically active and to be released by cells, however its function was not determined [21] . In this context, the inhibition of leishmanial growth produced by MDL 28170 may be due to its effects on calpainlike molecules. These results add new in vitro insights into the exploitation of calpain inhibitors in treating parasitic infections and add this family of proteases to the list of potential targets for development of more potent and specific inhibitors.",
