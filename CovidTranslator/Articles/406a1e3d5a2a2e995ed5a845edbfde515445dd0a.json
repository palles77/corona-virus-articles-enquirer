These surface molecules associated with immune function were either induced (Class II) or upregulated (Class I and ICAM-1) on cultured retinal glial cells in a dose-and time-dependent manner following exposure to recombinant interferon-y (rIFN-y). MI-K Class I and II expression by passaged and primary cells was maximal (> 90% positive) after incubation with 100 U/ml of rIFN-y for 48 h. ICAM-I expression by primary and passaged cells tripled between 48 and 72 h after exposure to 25 or 50 U/ml of rIFN-y. By 72 h after exposure to 100 U/ml of rIFN-y, 62% of the retinal glia were positive for ICAM-1, whereas under normal culture conditions these molecules were detected on < 3% of the retinal glia. Bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a known stimulator of central nervous system (CNS) astrocytes, increased ICAM-expression only 3-fold to 9% of cells staining positively, but neither MHC Class I nor Class II expression was altered from baseline levels. Surface expression of ICAM-1, MHC Class I, and MHC Class II was unaffected by exposure to either rTNF-a (1000 U/ml) or rIL-6 (100 U/ml> for 24 h. Under normal culture conditions, intracellular interleukind (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) were detected immunohistochemically. Exposure to either rIFN-y or LPS induced more intense staining which correlated with increased secreted levels of both cytokines in culture supematants. Levels of secreted TNF-a increased 6-fold after stimulation with LPS for 24 h, while secreted IL-6 increased over 9-fold. These results support the hypothesis that retinal glia may participate in intraretinal immune processes following stimulation during inflammatory and infectious processes via either cell surface-or soluble mediator-dependent mechanisms or a combination of both.",

            "text": "Glial cells of Miiller influence development and function of neuronal cells in the retina (Ripps and Witkovsky, 1985) . The role of MYiller cells in intraocular immune and antiviral responses, however, is unknown. While Miller cells are considered to be the functional equivalent of CNS astrocytes, the two cell types do not share a common precursor. In addition to Miiller cells, the retina also contains two other types of glial cells, retinal astrocytes and microglia. MiiIIer cells are derived from a multipotential precursor cell common to both Miller cells and retinal l neurons (Cepko, 1995) . Retinal astrocytes (type 1 astrocytes) are found in the nerve fiber layer and migrate into the retina from the optic nerve (Shaw and Weber, 1983; Ling and Stone, 1988; Huxlin et al., 1992) ; microglia are thought to be derived from a monocyte precursor cell (Linden et al., 1986; Hickey and Kimura, 1988) . In the normal murine retina, Mliller cells are negative by immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a unique component of cells of the astrocyte lineage and MUller cells (Eng, 1985) . GFAP expression is observed only in astrocytes in the nerve fiber layer of normal retina. However, both retinal Miller cells and CNS astrocytes from several species respond in vivo to injury or inflammation by proliferation and upregulated GFAP expression (Bignami and Dahl, 1979; Erickson et al., 1987; of Neuroimmunolo~y 64 (1996) [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] Ekstrom et al., 1988; Sarthy and Fu, 1989; Whittum-Hudson, 1992; Geiger et al., 1994) . In the human CNS, various disease states including multiple sclerosis (MS) lead to altered surface marker expression or cytokine production by astrocytes (Traugott and Raine, 1985; Mucke and Eddleston, 1993; Merrill and Jonakait, 1995) . Production of TNF-(Y and IL-6 is known to be modulated by IFN-y in many systems, though little is known regarding the ability of retinal glia to produce soluble mediators. Identification of immunologically relevant surface markers on retinal glia and the ability of these cells to produce soluble mediators may aid in the further elucidation of the potential role(s) of these cells in intraretinal immune or inflammatory responses after ocular infection or other injury such as retinal degeneration.",

Immunostaining and capture ELISA were used to detect altered cytokine production and secretion after exposure to viral and other immunologically relevant stimuli. The results reported here demonstrate that expression of MHC antigens and ICAM-I is altered on retinal glial cells upon exposure to IFN-7. Production of TNF-(Y and IL-6 is markedly upregulated after exposure to either LPS or IFN-y, thus supporting the potential of these retinal cells to actively participate in intraretinal immune or inflammatory responses.",

Immunohistochemically detectable MHC class I and II antigens and the adhesion molecule, ICAM-1, were induced or upregulated by rIFN-y or ConA-conditioned splenocyte medium in a dose-and time-dependent manner. In some species, surface marker expression varies in a strainspecific manner (Linke and Male, 1994) . However, we found no difference between BALB/c and B6-derived retinal glia in their ability to upregulate surface molecule expression despite differences in their in vivo susceptibility to many pathogens including HSV (Lopez, 1975; Pepose and Whittum-Hudson, 1987) . LPS, TNF-a, and IL-6, all shown to modulate surface marker expression by several cell types including cultured human CNS astrocytes (Springer, 1990; Satoh et al., 1991; Chang et al., 19941 , had no effect on the expression of these surface markers by cultured murine retinal glia. Our results for IFN-ymediated induction of MHC antigens on murine retinal glia differ somewhat from those of Mano et al. ( I99 1) who investigated the effects of IFN--y on expression of MHC antigens by human retinal Mliller (glia) cells using flow cytometry techniques. Those authors observed lower percentages of cells positive for MHC antigens after exposure to higher doses of recombinant human IFN-y for longer times. Alterations in ICAM-expression were not tested for in that study. Our studies of retinal glia did not exclusively distinguish between surface and intracellular localization of MHC antigens, but the ring staining was consistent with surface localization. MHC antigens could also be seen in the Golgi complex after stimulation, indicating new synthesis. Differences in our results and those of Mano et al. (1991) may reflect differences between human and inbred mouse retinal cells, the ages of cell donors (adult vs. newborn mice), assay conditions, or other factors (Barres, 1991) .",

In the absence of an inflammatory response, most cells express low levels of adhesion molecules which are upregulated after exposure to inflammatory mediators including IFN-y, TNF-a and IL-l (Springer, 1990) . The blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), once thought to be impermeable to cells and molecules, can be penetrated by activated T cells in non-disease states (Hickey et al., 1991; Prendergast et al., 1994) . The end foot processes of the Miller cells are a component of the BRB, and increased adhesion molecule expression on these cells may promote lymphocyte/monocyte extravasation from the blood into the inflamed retina. The mechanism(s) for an altered BRB that allows lymphocytes to enter the neuroretina in experimental autoimmune uveoretinitis (EAU) has not been well defined, though ICAM-expression correlates with retinal pathology in EAU (Greenwood, 1992) . Inappropriate ICAM-expression in the eye has been associated with other disease states in both mice and man. For example, ICAM-has been shown to be induced on cells of the iris and ciliary body in a murine model of endotoxin-induced uveitis, and disease is inhibited by in vivo treatment with anti-CD1 lb/CD18 antibody (Whitcup et al., 1993) . In eyes of humans with sickle cell disease or diabetes, aberrant ICAM-localization in retina has been described at a site consistent with Miiller cells (McLeod et al., 1995) . MHC antigen and adhesion molecule expression on normally negative CNS astrocytes has been described in vivo during several pathological processes in humans (Traugott and Raine, 1985; Frohman et al., 1989a, b) and in experimental animals. Studies of the CNS have also shown altered surface marker expression during disease (Traugott and Raine, 1985; Haegel et al., 1993; Smith et al., 1993a) . T lymphocytes are often present in these lesions and may provide the stimulus for such MHC antigen upregulation. Alternatively, pathology in some disease states is due to the overproduction of soluble mediators in the host, and adhesion molecules may provide a means of regulating cytokine production. In vitro studies have demonstrated that anti-ICAM-antibody profoundly inhibits the production of TNF-(u, IFN-y, and IL-l by human mitogenactivated mononuclear cells (Geissler et al., 1990) . This finding suggests that retinal glial cell cytokine production could be regulated through receptor-ligand interactions with infiltrating T cells. We have demonstrated that cul-tured murine retinal glial cells produce the cytokines TNF-(u and IL-6. The ability of the cells to express ICAM-may provide one means to regulate production of these cytokines.",

ICAM-was upregulated on rat CNS astrocytes by in vitro exposure to measles virus (Massa et al., 1987) . Both Class I and Class II antigens were induced on murine CNS astrocytes in vitro by West Nile virus infection (Liu et al., 1989) . In vivo, CNS astrocytes of coronavirus-infected rats expressed Class II, even if animals were first IFN-y-depleted, and support direct virus-mediated effects on MHC expression (Massa et al., 1987) . Alternatively, virus-infected cells are susceptible to lysis by cytotoxic T lymphocytes if viral peptides are presented in the context of MHC Class I (B&sky and Guagliardi, 1991) . In vitro studies by others have shown that flavivirus-infected murine astrocytes are lysed by specific CTL (Liu et al., 1989) . We demonstrated previously that cultured retinal glia and Mliller cells in intact retina are susceptible to infection with HSV (Whitturn-Hudson and Pepose, 1987; Merges and Whittum-Hudson, 1990) , which combined with our demonstration of inducible MHC antigens support the potential of Miller cells to serve as CTL targets during infection. Direct anti-viral effects of Mliller cells have not yet been demonstrated though both TNF-a and IL-6 are known to have anti-viral capacities in other systems (Wong et al., 1986; Wietzerbin et al., 1990) . CNS astrocytes are known to produce these cytokines during HIV-l infection (Genis et al., 1992) , but it has not been determined if these mediators prevent or contribute to pathology.",

            "text": "The similarity of results with passaged and primary cultures of newborn retinal glial cells and the reproducibility with cells obtained from many independently established cultures suggest that the responses by these cells reflect the in vivo capacity of Miiller cells to express and upregulate these surface markers and cytokines. Due to its relative immune privilege and limited access to systemic mediators, it is logical to suggest that resident retinal cell populations would contribute to control of infection and inflammation via the production and release of soluble mediators. However, the retinal microenvironment may negatively influence the in vivo functions of Muller cells by local production of downregulatory molecules such as transforming growth factors. Studies by Caspi et al. (1987) demonstrated that rat Miller cell lines continuously exposed to ConA-conditioned splenocyte media in vitro were immunosuppressive for T cell proliferation, apparently because of IL-l secreted by the Miller cells (Roberge et al., 1988) ; other cytokines were not tested for in the latter study. Whether the observed suppressive effect of cultured rat Mbller cells is operative in vivo for inflammatory or resident retinal cells is currently unknown. Many cytokines, including TNFm and IL-6, have been identified within the eye during inflammatory responses, and intraocular injection of these and other cytokines has been shown to induce uveitis (reviewed by De Vos et al., 1992) . In order to better understand control mechanisms which could be invoked to counter inflammatory reactions within the eye, it will be important to distinguish between resident and infiltrating cells as the source(s) of immunoregulatory cytokines and to determine the temporal relationships of resident cell-derived mediators and those produced by inflammatory cells reaching the retina to altered surface molecule expression on these populations. These issues have been addressed in studies of experimental and clinical uveitis (e.g. Whitcup et al., 19921 , but not during HSV-induced ocular inflammation.",

These cytokines also have opposing roles in induction of apoptosis (e.g. Smith et al., 1994) . Thus, retinal Mliller cells may play a role in maintenance of normal retinal integrity via their secretion of TNFcr, IL-6, and other soluble mediators commonly associated with immunological function. The dynamics of surface marker modulation and altered cytokine secretion by Miller cells in these normal and pathological retinal processes remain to be elucidated.
