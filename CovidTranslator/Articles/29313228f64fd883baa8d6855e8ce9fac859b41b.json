Rapid diagnosis of this infection is of great value in the formulation of the prognosis for children with acute diarrhoea and in decisions concerning management and control measures. Since the cultivation of rotaviruses from clinical specimens is difficult to achieve, the most widely used diagnostic techniques for rotavirus detection in faecal samples include immunoassays such as ELISA and latex agglutination, electron microscopy (EM) and immune electron microscopy, and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of viral double-stranded RNA (Kapikian and Chaneck, 1996) . Nucleic acid hybridization techniques in the format of \"dot blots\" have also been applied to the detection of rotaviral RNA @'lores et al., 1983) . However, RNA detection assays have generally not proven to be substantially more sensitive than optimized immunoassay procedures (Wilde et aZ., 1990) .",

Although this increase in sensitivity may be feasible, in practice it may be very occult to achieve. In our study, four samples were positive by RT/PCR but negative by ELBA, probably due to the higher sensitivity of the fust technique. Moreover, great care must be taken to avoid i~ibi~~ substances in the enzymatic reactions. PAGE can detect as little as 10 ng rotavirus RNA (Herring et al., 1982) and in aur hands, appears to be a very reproducible technique. Gouvea et al. (1990) reported the requirement of at least 2 ng (lo* cop ies) of viral RNA in the faecal specimen in order to be detected as rotavirus-positive by RT/ER. Xu et al. (1990) were able to detect 8 x lo3 virus particles by RT/PCR under experimental conditions. However, we do not consider that RT/FCR should replace the more conveutional immunoassays in the diagnosis of rotavirus infections performed in clinical virology laboratories. Obviously, RTECR is a very sensitive and specific assay, but it is more expensive due to the costs of enzymes and more time-consuming, and the results are obtained later than with other techniques such as immunor~ys and/or EM. Both G and P typing of rotavirus strains with specific primers is a main application of RWFCR (Gouvea et ab, 1990; Ushijima et & 1992; Gentsch et d, 1992) as are other studies on the genomic variability of these viruses (Wnsover et d, 1993) .",
