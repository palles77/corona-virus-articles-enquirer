            "text": "The purpose of this study was to determine the origin and subsequent spread of feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus (FHV), and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) in cats relinquished to shelters. FCV was isolated from the oral fauces of 11% of healthy cats upon entry, and isolation rates were highest for kittens (33%). FHV shedding was very low (4%) at the time of entry and occurred mainly in juveniles. FECV shedding was also common among newly relinquished cats (33%), especially older kittens and juveniles (90%). The subsequent spread of all three viruses was rapid and efficient in the shelter environment. Fifteen percent of cats were shedding FCV, 52% FHV, and 60% FECV after 1 week. More detailed studies were done with FECV shedding, which could be accurately quantitated. The amounts of FECV shed by infected cats ranged from 10 2 to 10 16 particles/swab of feces. FECV shedding was several logs higher in young kittens with primary infection than adult cats with primary infections. The mean levels of FECV shedding among adults were the same for primary and chronic infections. Although shelters were not the primary source of these viruses for many relinquished cats, factors intrinsic to the shelter environment were critical in amplifying shedding and spread to susceptible individuals. Extrinsic factors were especially important for the spread of FHV and FECV. FHV shedding rates increased from 4% to 50% in 1 week's time. The speed and magnitude of the increase in FHV shedding suggested that there was reactivation of latent infections as well as acquisition of new infections. FECV shedding increased 10 to 1,000,000 fold in 1 week among cats that were already infected at entry, and more than one-half of initially negative cats were shedding FECV a week later. Feline calicivirus infection was the least likely to spread in the shelter. The infection rate only increased from 11 to 15% in 1 week.",

            "text": "The biannual APPMA national pet owners' surveys show the proportion of cats obtained from shelters increasing from 12 to 20% in the United States between 1996 and 2000. 1 Unfortunately, the shel-ter environment can be stressful, and husbandry, feeding practices, and housing procedures favor contagion. Infectious diseases are particularly troublesome in large multiple cat environments such as shelters (Pedersen, 1991) . Acute infections are a major cause for triage and euthanasia of cats in traditional shelters and an economic hardship in no-kill shelters. Chronic sequelae of certain infections can also be a major problem for adopted cats. Acute feline calicivirus infection is usually not a serious problem in shelters in its own right (Pedersen, 1988a) , but may enhance mortality to feline panleukopenia in dual infections (Bittle et al., 1961) . Shelter environments have occasionally served as sources for highly virulent FCV mutants (Pedersen et al., 2000) . A proportion of FCV recovered cats will continue to shed virus from their oral fauces and a fraction of these carriers will ultimately develop a chronic, largely untreatable, ulceroproliferative faucitis (Reubel et al., 1992) . Similarly, acute FHV infection may require two or more weeks of supportive treatment and is therefore a manageable, albeit troublesome, disease (Pedersen, 1988b) . A large proportion of acutely FHV infected cats will go on to become latent carriers (Hickman et al., 1994) . Some of these FHV recovered cats will manifest permanent scarring and atrophy of their nasal passages, predisposing them to lifetime of epiphora or chronic bacterial infections of the nasal/sinus passages. Chronic herpetic ulcers of the cornea are another complication. Acute FECV infection is almost always asymptomatic, with only a low incidence of acute enteritis signs (Pedersen et al., 1981) . However, 5% or more of FECV infected cats, especially if kittens, will develop fatal feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) (Pedersen, 1995) . The FIP virus (FIPV) is a naturally and frequently occurring mutation of FECV (Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998) . Mutations are more likely to occur, and/or cause disease, in primary infections in younger kittens (Foley et al., 1997b) , in kittens with unfavorable genetic predisposition , or in animals that are immunosuppressed (Poland et al., 1996) .",

We were also interested in how the sheltering experience might influence the level of virus shedding. FECV lent itself best to quantification; therefore, it was used as a model of how factors such as primary vs. secondary exposure, age, time in shelter, and the overall sheltering experience might influence these common viral agents.",

Most acute FHV disease is seen in the post-weaning period (Pedersen, 1988b) . Therefore, it was not surprising to observe the highest FHV shedding rate in juveniles and the lowest in young adults and kittens. The rapid increase in virus shedding, from 4 to 52% after 1 week in the shelter, was much higher than anticipated. FHV is very efficiently spread from cat-to-cat and every cat that has been previously infected is a potential latent carrier (Hickman et al., 1994) . Stresses as simple as moving a cat into a new environment can convert latent to active infections in a few days (Gaskell and Povey, 1977; Hickman et al., 1994) . Therefore, it was not possible to determine how much of the increased rate of FHV shedding during the first week in the shelter was due to virus exposure and how much to activation of preexisting latent infections. The marked increase in virus shedding after only 1 week clearly demonstrates why FHV is one of the most important causes of disease in shelter environments.",

Outdoor cats tend to bury their feces in distinct territories, thus limiting fecal-oral contact. However, the cats that were being relinquished to the shelters and included in this study were not feral in behavior. They also tended to come from urban areas, where the density of outdoor cats is high. These factors often lead to the common use of gardens, sand boxes, etc. FECV is relatively stable, lasting up to 7 days in the environment. FECV is somewhat unique because immunity is not long-lasting and re-infections are common (reviewed by Pedersen, 1995) . About one in ten infected cats will persistently shed the virus, eight in ten will undergo repeated re-infections, and one in ten will develop solid immunity (Foley et al., 1997a) . Two cats that appeared to be immune to FECV were observed in the present study. These animals remained non-infected even after 2 weeks of stress and exposure.",

Therefore, shelters are not the ultimate source of these particular viruses, but the shelter environment appears to amplify and efficiently spread these agents and enhance clinical disease. The impact of infection by FCV, FHV and FECV can have immediate and long-term consequences to a shelter, depending on the relative importance of acute and chronic disease manifestations. Acute disease is the most obvious problem for shelters, while chronic disease is largely a problem for cats that have been adopted into homes. Acute FCV disease may not be as great of a problem in shelters in this area as believed, because most cats have been exposed to FCV prior to relinquishment and the virus can persist in the face of routine immunization (Pedersen and Hawkins, 1995) . Furthermore, acute FCV disease tends to be mild or inapparent in nature, even in similar high cat density environments (Johnson, 1984) . However, under certain conditions, FCV infection can greatly increase the mortality to feline panleukopenia (FPV) virus infection (Bittle et al., 1961) , and we have also observed that many shelter cats dying of panleukopenia are coinfected with FCV. FCV can infrequently mutate or recombine with other strains in the shelter milieu to produce a highly virulent virus associated with outbreaks of fatal hemorrhagic fever (Pedersen et al., 2000) . The most important clinical manifestation of FCV infection is probably chronic ulceroproliferative faucitis, a progressive disease that occurs in some FCV carriers (Reubel et al., 1992) . This disease is a major cause of euthanasia.",

The shelter environment is ideal for reactivation of latent infections, spread of the virus from cat-tocat, and for enhancing the severity of disease signs through stress and increased exposure. Acute FHV infection is probably the single leading cause for shelter cats to be destroyed or to receive veterinary care. As bad as acute FHV infection is in shelters, there are also serious chronic sequelae to the infection that must be borne by recovered cats. Long term effects of acute FHV disease include scarring of the nasolacrimal and chronic epiphora, persistence of replicating virus in the nerves of the cornea and indolent ulcers, and chronic scarring and atrophy of the nasal mucosa and turbinates resulting in chronic rhinosinusitis (Pedersen, 1988b) .",

However, during bouts of virus replication in the gut, macrophagetropic mutants are frequently generated (Poland et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1998) . Some of these mutant viruses leave the gut and are carried systemically by their macrophage hosts. Such mutant viruses cause feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a disease that ultimately kills upwards of 5% of shelter kittens (Pedersen, 1995) . Anything that in-creases virus replication in the gut will increase the likelihood of this mutation to occur (Poland et al., 1996) . Young kittens, which are at greatest risk, produce the highest amounts of virus. Most kittens less than 8 weeks of age coming into shelters have not been exposed to FECV, but virtually all are shedding after 1 week. The amount of virus replication is also enhanced ten to a million fold by the mere fact of being placed in a shelter, an environmental influence that is probably similar to that which increases FHV shedding. It is not surprising; therefore, that FIP is one of the most important diseases of cats coming from shelter environments.",

Although shelters are not the primary source of these viruses, the shelter environment serves to spread the viruses between infected and noninfected individuals and to amplify shedding, in particular for FHV and FECV. The proportion of cats shedding FHV can go up over ten-fold in 1 week, while the incidence of FECV shedders will almost double. Factors intrinsic to the sheltering experience appear to increase FECV shedding from 10-to 1,000,000-fold after 1 week. Similar factors probably account for the dramatic increase in FHV shedding.
