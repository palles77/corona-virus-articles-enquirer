The IFN-\u03b2 1a preparation employed in this study was selected because it is currently used as part of the most effective treatment regimen for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (8) , and more importantly, because it was shown to have antiviral activity (as measured in a vesicular stomatitis virus cytopathic assay system) 14 times greater than the currently available treatment using IFN-\u03b2 1b (9) .",

Inhibition of the SARS-CoVs by IFN-\u03b2 1a was dependent on both time of drug administration and time of culture sampling after SARS-CoV infection. Production of infectious SARS-CoV was potently inhibited (>99.5% or 2.00 log 10 PFU/mL) at 24 h postinfection by pretreatment of Vero E6 cells with IFN-\u03b2 1a at all concentrations tested (Figure 1 ). By 72 h postinfection, inhibition of SARS-CoV production by IFN-\u03b2 1a had declined for all three SARS-CoVs, with inhibition (>70%) being detected in the Tor7 (Figure 1 ) and Urbani isolates (data not shown). IFN-\u03b2 1a was somewhat less effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV replication when employed after infection of cultures ( Figure 1) . Nonetheless, production of infectious SARS-CoVs was considerably reduced (>90% or 1.00 log 10 PFU/mL) at 24 and 48 h postinfection. Protection of Vero E6 monolayers against SARS-CoV-induced cytopathic effects by preinfection or postinfection treatment with IFN-\u03b2 1a was dramatic, even at 72 h postinfection (Figure 2 ). Additional concentrations of IFN-\u03b2 1a (0.5-5,000 IU/mL) were tested to determine the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ). Pretreatment of Vero E-6 cells with concentrations as low as 50 IU/mL, or posttreatment of cells with concentrations at 500 IU/mL, provided a 50% reduction with the Tor2 isolate at 24 h postinfection.",

As noted above, IFN-\u03b2 1a is currently being used for a variety of clinical indications, including multiple sclerosis, and has shown dose-dependent efficacy in several clinical trials. Importantly, IFN-\u03b2 1a exhibited potent antiviral activity at doses that have already been shown to have acceptable safety profiles in animals (10) .
