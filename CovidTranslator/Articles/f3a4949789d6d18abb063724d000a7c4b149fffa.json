Purpose: To compare the differences between northern and southern hospitals in Mainland China with respect to nurses' job satisfaction. Methods: A cross-sectional survey design was selected. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, independent t test, chi-square test, correlation, and linear regression. Results: Nurses in northern hospitals were older, had higher educational levels yet received lower pay in comparison with their counterparts in the southern region. Despite these salary differences, those in the north consistently rated their job satisfaction greater in all areas except professional opportunities. Conclusion: Regional differences were related to nurses' job satisfaction. Potential contributing factors included philosophical, cultural, and economic differences between the 2 regions. The noteworthy regional differences that potentially related to nurse' job satisfaction should be investigated in future studies.",

China has had a growing nursing profession with baccalaureate and master's education begun in the 1900s, and doctoral education initiated in 2004. However, in China, higher educated (those with baccalaureate degrees and beyond) nurses are more likely than less well-educated nurses to leave nursing. This greater turnover of more highly educated nurses is noteworthy because they represent future leadership of the profession in China. 7, 8 ",

The concepts of Northern and Southern China originate from differences in climate, geography, culture, and physical traits, as well as several periods of actual political division in history. 11 There are also major differences in language, cuisine, and popular entertainment forms. During the China Economic Reforms of the 1980s, Southern China developed much faster than Northern China, which led to the unbalanced regional economic development. To date, most nurses' job satisfaction and relevant studies in China have focused on a certain region, and no documented studies have explored the regional difference impact on nurses' job satisfaction. Considering that the huge discrepancy of culture, economy, and perspectives from Southern and Northern China may play a role on nurses' job satisfaction, this study addressed the comparison between the southern and northern hospitals in mainland China.",

Job satisfaction is a frequently studied variable in organizational behavior research and also a central variable in both research and theory of organizational phenomena ranging from job design to supervision. 13 High job satisfaction improves the ability of the health organization to recruit and retain nurses. 14, 15 Tourangeau and Cranley 16 reported a relationship between nurses' job retention and their satisfaction with pay and benefits, scheduling, control (autonomy), responsibility, and professional opportunities. In a study that included 5 countries, Aiken and colleagues found that job dissatisfaction among nurses was highest in the United States (41%) followed by Scotland (38%), England (36%), Canada (33%), and Germany (17%). 17 A Chinese study found that more than half of respondents (53.7%) who were Chinese nurses were satisfied with their jobs. 10 Worldwide evidence indicates that job satisfaction is a major predictor of nursing absenteeism, burnout, turnover, and intention to quit 9,18-20 and has the largest effect on nurses' intent to stay and is important in predicting nurses' retention. [21] [22] [23] Therefore, it is incumbent upon health care administrators and nursing managers to assess nurses' job satisfaction to develop strategies to improve nurses' retention.",

The average annual salary of nursing staff is U27,000 CNY (about $4100 USD) in mainland China, which is higher than the annual income of U17,811 CNY in ($2700 USD) in the northern area 43 but lower than the average annual income of U43,000 CNY ($6600 USD) in Shanghai. 44 In this study, although nurses in northern hospitals strongly agreed with the item \"An upgrading of the pay scales at your agency is needed,\" they remain more satisfied with \"present pay\" than southern nurses and this may indicate that although the northern nurses are aware of the income gap between northern and southern nurses, they accept it and remain optimistic. This is consistent with the northern economy being less developed than southern China, resulting in lower average income. Comparatively, nurses' pay in the north is far more than average among the work forces in the region 41 and this could be the reason that northern nurses are more satisfied and willing to stay in nursing. Conversely, although southern nurses are paid more than northern nurses, they still feel less satisfied than the northern nurses because nurses' pay in the southern region is much less than the average of the rest of the region's work force. 45 ",

However, both northern and southern nurses are very much dissatisfied with the item \"Nursing is widely recognized as being an important profession\" because despite improvement in the last decade, nurses in China have very low socially recognized status. Although nurses are also referred to as \"white angels\" in mainland China, because of the entrenched traditional concept, the social status of nurses is still relatively low, and it has been difficult for the nursing profession to receive public recognition and respect. This recognition and respect increased somewhat when Chinese nurses played an important role in the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) crisis and were recognized and praised by the public, thereby increasing nurses' sense of achievement, motivation, and enthusiasm for their work.",

Second, to make the sample from the 2 regions comparable, only hospitals with similarity of scale, array of services, and work environments were selected. Thus, a larger sample from broader scopes of hospitals has to be included in further research using a randomized sampling technique. Third, because the data were collected in 2006, this study may serve as providing an essential base for comparison with the current situation because the role of nursing and the economy in China have evolved since that time.",

The findings of this study may help Chinese health care administrators develop strategies in improving nurses' job satisfaction that take regional characteristics into consideration, such as educational, income and consumption level, and philosophical and cultural differences. In addition, nurse managers can enable nurses to experience professional satisfaction, personal balance, and opportunities for choices by offering flexible scheduling options. The results of this study are considered a baseline for future research with a larger and more homogenous sample to enhance generalization of the results. Furthermore, the noteworthy differences between regions in cultural values, political status, economic levels, and standard of livingdall of which may potentially relate to nurses' job satisfactiondshould be investigated in future studies in China and in other countries of the world.",
