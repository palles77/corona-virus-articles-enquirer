Greek mythology provides the first legendary description of a biological weapon: Hercules, after killing the nine-headed hydra, dipped his arrows into the poisonous venom to increase their lethality. In ancient Greece, Solon of Athens is said to have used hellebore roots, a purgative, to poison an aqueduct around 590 B.C., allowing the Athenians to take over the city of Cirrha.",

An important teaching provided in this part is the importance of health care worker and hospital leadership, which are fundamental in ensuring a rapid and effective response.

While offering insights into the cellular and molecular biology of various pathogens, this part gravitates around the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the associated infection(s), molecular mechanisms of disease, clinical manifestations and diagnosis, therapy and prophylaxis. Highlights of this second part, which comprises three sections, are chapters on anthrax, plague, smallpox and encephalitis viruses, microbial toxins with bioterrorism potential, and microorganisms that threaten the safety of the food and water supplies. Furthermore, discussions about microorganisms with an unknown bioterror potential, but which nevertheless raise certain concerns, such as multidrug resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rabies, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, represent thought-provoking topics. The highly pathogenic avian influenza is featured as a prototype for devastating pandemics, and the engineering of novel strains by recombinant technologies represents an important part of the volume. This section emphasizes the importance of new detection methods in complementing traditional approaches, and the great hopes kindled by the advent of the genomic era.",

Challenges that we face in diagnosing and treating deliberately caused infectious disease outbreaks are compounded by the recently expressed concern that most illnesses of biodefense concern are rarely or never seen by physicians. 4 In exploring diseases of biodefense concern, the book reveals the impact that more sophisticated diagnostic and treatment methodologies have on our understanding of microbial pathogenesis and on our endeavors for successful prophylaxis and treatment. The volume is an excellent and comprehensive resource that bridges basic sciences with clinical infectious diseases and will be a masterpiece for professionals in the field.",
