Employing RT-PCR technique to amplify ORF7 sequence of TGEV, which located at the 3\u00a2 end of TGEV genome and is poorly understood functionally so far. A recombinant named pPROEX HTc-hp was constructed via inserting ORF7 gene into prokaryotic expression vector pPROEX HTc. The recombinant was sequenced and compared the DNA and its deduced amino acid (aa) sequences with that of some reference strains after restriction endonuclease and PCR analysis. The ORF7 gene named hp gene (Genbank accession number: AY337931) consists of 237 bp in length encoding a hydrophobic protein (HP) of 78 aa with a molecular weight of 9.1 kDa. The sequences of hp gene and Hp protein share 89%-97% and 87%-96% homologous identities compared with 11 TGEV reference strains derived from other regions or countries respectively, which revealed that there are significant variation within-strains, even though the ORF7 region is relatively conservative. In addition, a phylogenetic tree based on these ORF7 DNA sequences was generated, and the tree topology suggests that possible recombination events happened in the evolutionary history of TGEV.",

Finally, the typical CPE of cell monolayer is like a net formed by several cells and no syncytia formation (data not shown), so we further verified that ST cells were excellent permissive to TGEV infection. To consider economical reason, we purified TGEV viral pellets by different speed centrifugation and extracted RNA using common chemical reagent according to standard Manual of RNA manipulation [16] . The results showed that RNA extracted was high concentration and purity, however, cDNA of TGEV were synthesized without difficulty. The hp gene of TGEV Chinese isolate was cloned with RT-PCR and genetic recombination techniques for the first time. The recombinant can express the encoded protein directly in E coli. due to the utilizing a prokaryotic expression vector substituted for clone vector, which benefits to the further functional research and structural analysis.",

To analyze the sequence differences from the angle of geographical distribution, five Japanese strains' ORF7 sequences had the exact identity with the exception of TO-163, TGEV Chinese isolate, TH-98 and TFI shares high homology with these reference strains in term of hp gene (ORF7), which confirmed that 3\u00a2-terminal region of TGEV genome is relatively conservative.
