The content of training included personal protection such as hand hygiene, wearing personal protective equipment (PPE), safe waste disposal, and emergency handling protocols. The means of training included presentations, videos, and WeChat. First, the infection control experts from various hospitals trained their own staffs both theoretically and practically. The training emphasized the importance of standardized protection. Second, the infection control experts conducted standardized pre-job training. The infection control experts supervised the whole process to ensure that all the staffs had followed the correct procedures. Third, the infection control experts monitored the entire process before and after the medical staff entering the isolation wards. They also supervised the procedures of medical staffs in the isolation wards by wireless communication equipment.",

It is crucial to ensure the stable psychological state of the medical staffs. Therefore, early professional intervention is necessary.
