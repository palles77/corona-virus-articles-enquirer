In the 2000s, newly identified CoVs, HCoVNL63 and HCoV-HKU1, were introduced. CoV is now an important pathogen in pediatric infections, not only in URTIs but also in LRTIs, such as community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis. [12] [13] [14] [15] Our data revealed a higher positive rate of total respiratory viruses. 16, 17 As our hospital provides tertiary care, the disease severity of admitted children may be higher than other studies. Furthermore, viral study is performed only in children with suspected lower respiratory tract disease. This may have influenced higher detection rate of viruses.",

After about five weeks, HCoV began to be detected in our pediatric patients. It is difficult to determine the reason for the delayed HCoV detection in LRTIs, compared to that in general lower respiratory infections. This study is based on the respiratory virus infection data of the KCDC, which examines references weekly. These references are obtained from the sputum of adults and children who visit primary medical centers due to respiratory infection symptoms, not only for lower but also upper respiratory infection symptoms. This means that those viruses are thought to be the pathogens of the upper respiratory infection, as shown in Fig. 2 . In general, respiratory viruses are spread by children who attend school. They transmit them to adults or infants and young children. In light on this result, we predict that when respiratory infections due to HCoV increase in primary care settings, as reported weekly by the KCDC, lower respiratory infections due to HCoV in children will increase within a few weeks.",
