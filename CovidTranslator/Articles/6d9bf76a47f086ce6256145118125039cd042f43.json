Infection of this virus was first reported in December, 2019, and origin of the virus was traced back to a large seafood/wide animal market in Wuhan City. The serious clinical symptoms of the viral infection, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia, may result in progressive respiratory failure and even death. Moreover, the quick spread of the virus has caused epidemic in China, as well as infection cases worldwide. The whole genome sequence of Wuhan new virus (WH-Human_1) was first released on Jan 10, 2020 (Zhang, 2020) , and followed by additional ones released in GISAID (Shu and McCauley, 2017) . Later, this new virus was determined and announced as a new type of coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by WHO (WHO, 2020a).",

Among them, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-CoV can cause serious respiratory syndrome in human (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019) . For instance, the outbreak of SARS in 2003 led to a pandemic with 8906 infected cases and 774 deaths reported worldwide (WHO, 2003) .

Mapping the epitope regions to 3D structure of S protein of 2019-nCoV demonstrated that, five epitope regions are located in RBD (Fig. S1 ). For each region, CE-BLAST calculates the similarity score of antigenicity between CoV pairs by comparing the physic-chemical difference in 3D adjacent structural regions (Qiu et al., 2018) .

It can be seen that, though the clustering results may vary slightly for different regions, the antigenicity of CoV S proteins can be generally divided into two major groups. Detailed results for the 6 th epitope region shown in Fig.1A and B displayed the detailed clustering of 2019-nCoV group, as well as the similarity score between them. Antigenically, 2019-nCoV is most similar to SARS-CoV, and followed by BCoV (Fig. 1B) . High similarity scores above 0.80 were detected between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV strains. Considering the default cutoff of 0.75 as antigenically similar (Qiu et al., 2018) , these results indicate the existence of potential CREs between 2019-nCoV and SARS virus.",

Interestingly, though no direct overlapping, the potential CRE residues are highly adjacent to essential ACE2 binding sites in 3D structure (Shi et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020) , suggesting that neutralization antibodies targeting CRE may also interfere or even block the interaction between the new coronavirus and ACE2 receptor because of steric hindrance (Fig. 1F ).

As Fig. S1 indicates, epitope region 3 is located in S1 domain, which is far from the important ACE2 binding site. For the rest 5 regions, though located in receptor binding domain, some epitope residues become spatially scattered, rather than maintaining the epitope conformation, such as the case in region 1. Thus, region 6 was recommended here for CRE candidates because of its high score, surface continuity, and proximity to essential binding sites of ACE2. Possibility of additional CRE may also exist in other regions of S protein, or other antigens between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. It is noted that, these potential CREs are highly conformational. Following antibody design and screening is suggested to consider the whole domain, as antibodies derived from linear epitopes might have difficulty in fully recognizing the CRE structures.",
