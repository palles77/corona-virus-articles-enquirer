Five of the b-MAbs were specific for the peplomer (E 2), five reacted to the nucleocapsid (N), and one reacted to the E 1 protein of the Miller strain of TGEV. Protein A-Sepharose purification of MAbs yielded protein concentrations ranging from 0.40 to 3 mg per ml of ascites. Separate pools of N-MAbs and E 2-MAbs, and the E 1-MAb were used to monitor synthesis of TGE viral antigen in ST cells from 0 to 16 h post-infection at various multiplicities of infection (MOI)",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) is a contageous enteric viral infection of swine causing the highest mortality rate (80-90%) in seronegative piglets under 2 weeks of age [14] . The TGE virion consists of three major proteins: the nucleocapsid or N protein (46 kDa) and two membrane-bound glycoproteins, E 1 and E 2. The E 1 glycoprotein has a MW of 29 kDa and the E 2 or peplomer protein has a MW of 200 kDa. The E 2 protein elicits neutralizing antibodies [5] . To elucidate the nature of epitopes on TGEV, monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) have been produced to a number of attenuated strains of the virus [-2, 3, 8, 9, 11, 12, 19] . Laude et al. [12] produced MAbs against the three major structural proteins of the attenuated (Purdue) strain of TGEV. When a panel of the neutralizing E 2 MAbs were tested against nine strains of TGEV in virus neutralization (VN) and cell culture immunofluorescence (CCIF) assays, several of the MAbs exhibited diminished binding and neutralization of some strains. A competition radioimmunoassay identified four major antigenic sites (A, B, C, and D) on the E2 protein [3] i The majority of neutralizing determinants were clustered in A and B sites. When the MAbs were used to probe several strains of porcine (TGEV) and feline (feline infectious peritonitis) coronaviruses, strong conservation of sites A and B of the E 2 proteins was found on all viruses tested [11] . This conservation of sites was also observed with another independent panel of 14 neutralizing E 2 MAbs generated to attenuated Purdue TGEV [2] . The six epitopes identified by this panel were detected in 11 attenuated and virulent viral isolates obtained from the United States, Japan, and Europe within the last 16 years. These E2 MAbs were also mapped onto four (A, B, C, and D) antigenic sites of the peplomer protein [9] . In another study, Garwes et al. [6] generated neutralizing MAbs to the virulent British FS 772/ 70 strain of TGEV which reacted with several epitopes on the E 2 protein. The relationships among the antigenic sites identified on the E 2 protein by these various investigators [3, 6, 9] have not been reported. Moreover, epitope mapping of the TGEV N-protein has not been described.",

Three neutalizing E 2-MAbs and five nonneutralizing N-MAbs were identified.

Biotinylation of MAbs is a rapid method of producing labeled antibodies without attaching relatively large enzyme moieties which might significantly alter the affinity and specificity of the antibody. It is simpler and safer than isotopic labeling with 125I. No extensive time-consuming purification of virus is required and some aspects of in vivo replication of the virus, not possible with purified viral preparations, can be examined. The purification of the MAbs from ascites allowed us to determine the different concentrations of MAbs present. The concentrations over a 7.5-fold range suggest that caution should be used when using crude ascitic fluids in experiments in which the level of antibody may have a significant effect on the interpretation of results.",

The ratios for 25 C9, 25 H4, and 25 A2 are approximately 1 and from the competition studies they appear to be in the same antigenic site, whereas the ratio for 25 E4 is nearly 60 times greater and 25 E 4 appears to share the same antigenic site as the nonneutralizing MAb 26 F 4.",

It can provide useful information about the appearance of viral antigens and infectivity titers of TGEV, relative affinity and neutralization concentrations of MAbs, and it can be used for competition assays to identify epitopes of TGEV viral proteins. The fixed-cell ELISA and b-MAbs may be useful techniques and reagents for future studies of detection and diagnosis of TGEV infections. Use of b-MAbs to the N proteins of TGEV may be especially useful for early and rapid detection of TGEV antigens in cell cultures inoculated with fecal specimens from TGEV suspect pigs or in mucosal smears from such pigs.",
