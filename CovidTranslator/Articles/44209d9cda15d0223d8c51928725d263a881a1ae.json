Here we provide biochemical and X-ray structural evidence for a new GTP-hydrolysis mechanism, where the G-domains of MnmE dimerise in a potassiumdependent manner and induce GTP hydrolysis. The structure in the presence of GDP-AlF x and potassium shows how juxtaposition of the subunits induces a conformational change around the nucleotide which reorients the catalytic machinery. A critical glutamate is positioned such as to stabilise or activate the attacking water. Potassium provides a positive charge into the catalytic site in a position analogous to the arginine finger in the Ras-RasGAP system. Mutational studies show that potassium-dependent dimerisation and GTP hydrolysis can be uncoupled and that interaction between the G-domains is a prerequisite for subsequent phosphoryl transfer. We propose a model for the juxtaposition of G-domains in the full-length protein and how it induces conformational changes in the putative tRNA-modification centre.",

            "text": "MnmE (formerly TrmE) is a Guanine nucleotide-binding protein (GNBP) that is conserved in all three kingdoms of life. Unlike Ras-like proteins, which cycle between a GDP bound inactive and a GTP bound active state, in which they interact with effector proteins (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001) , MnmE is apparently directly involved in an enzymatic reaction, the modification of the wobble uridine (U34) in tRNAs in bacteria, yeast and mammalia (i.e. tRNA Lys , tRNA Glu , tRNA 4 Leu , tRNA 4 Arg and probably tRNA Gln ). The modification to the hypermodified U34 involves several proteins performing different steps of the reaction. MnmE together with the protein MnmG, formerly GidA (Elseviers et al, 1984; Br\u00e9geon et al, 2001) , catalyses the formation of the carboxymethylaminomethyl group at the 5 position (cmnm 5 U), although the precise role of either protein in the reaction is unknown. Final modification to 5-methylaminomethyl-uridine in bacteria, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine in yeast and 5-taurinomethyl-uridine in human allows interaction with G and A, but restricts base-pairing with C and U (Yokoyama et al, 1979; Yokoyama et al, 1985; Yokoyama and Nishimura, 1995) , thereby avoiding misincorporation of amino acids in mixed codon box families (Lys, Glu, Leu, Arg and Gln). Furthermore, the hypermodified U34 influences frame shifting during the translation process (Brierley et al, 1997; Hagervall et al, 1998; Bjork et al, 1999; Urbonavicius et al, 2001) .",

            "text": "Several mechanisms for the stimulation of the intrinsically slow GTPase reaction of GNBPs have so far been discovered. Ras proteins interact with a GAP specific for each subfamily. RasGAPs and RhoGAPs stimulate hydrolysis by supplying a catalytic residue, an 'arginine finger', into the active site. This stabilises the endogenous glutamine residue which in turn stabilises the water molecule for the in-line attack while the arginine neutralises negative charge of band g-phosphate oxygens in the transition state, and a similar mechanism is likely to hold for RabGAPs also. RanGAPs act by merely stabilising the catalytic machinery of Ran without using an arginine, similar to RGS proteins (regulator of G protein signalling) which stabilise the crucial endogenous Gln and Arg residues in the catalytically relevant conformation of Ga-proteins (Vetter and Wittinghofer, 2001; Seewald et al, 2002; Rehmann and Bos, 2004) . Rap proteins do not have a glutamine residue corresponding to Gln61, and Rap1GAP provides an essential Asn residue, called 'asparagine thumb' in analogy to the 'arginine finger' to accelerate hydrolysis, presumably by stabilising the nucleophilic water (Daumke et al, 2004) .",

The large GTP-binding proteins dynamin and human guanylate-binding protein 1 (hGBP1) show a concentration-dependent hydrolysis reaction (Praefcke and McMahon, 2004) . In hGBP1, a cis-Arg is relocated into the active site by dimerisation (Ghosh et al, 2006) . The bacterial homologues of the signal recognition particle (SRP) and the signal recognition particle receptor (SR) form a heterodimeric complex by which they stimulate each others GTPase reaction. Structural analysis has shown that this is achieved by complementing each others active site, especially a mutual hydrogen bond between the ribose of one with the g-phosphate of the other partner (Focia et al, 2004; Egea et al, 2004) . GTPase stimulation by dimerisation is also known for the chloroplast translocon factor Toc34 (Sun et al, 2002) .",

The N-terminal a/b-domain (1-118) induces dimerisation and binding of 5-formyl-tetrahydrofolate (5-formyl-THF). The central helical domain, which is only poorly conserved except for the C-terminal motif C(I/L/V)GK, forms a four-helix bundle. As shown by Yim et al (2003) , Cys447 (Cys451 in MnmE from Escherichia coli) in this motif is essential for the tRNA modification activity of MnmE. The G-domain of MnmE (211-380) is inserted into the two halves of the central helical subdomain. It conserves the canonical Ras-like fold, with no insertion or deletion of secondary structural elements. In the structure, the G-domain is only loosely connected to the residual domains of MnmE, which may explain why the G-domain alone can be expressed and exhibits a GTPase activity similar to that of the full-length protein (Cabedo et al, 1999) . The G-domain contains all canonical sequence elements, GxxxxGKS/T or P-loop (Saraste et al, 1990) , T, DxxG, NKxD and SAK (Bourne et al, 1990 (Bourne et al, , 1991 and exhibits a comparatively high hydrolysis rate, although it carries a hydrophobic residue at the position of the catalytic Q61 present in Ras.

We thus analysed the role of the G-domain and potassium in the function of MnmE.",

This N-terminally truncated protein retained the fast, potassium ion-dependent reaction ( Figure 1A ), indicating that the N-terminal dimerisation domain of MnmE is not involved in the selectivity for potassium. Supporting earlier observations, the G-domain alone (residues G216 to G384) can be stably expressed. It also shows a fast, KCl-dependent GTPase reaction ( Figure 1A) , indicating that the binding site for potassium is located in the G-domain of MnmE. To narrow down the requirement for GTPase stimulation, we analysed the effect of the alkali metals rubidium and caesium on the hydrolysis activity of the isolated G-domain. While Rb \u00fe has a similar activating effect as K \u00fe , Cs \u00fe only showed a slight activation over control or the reaction in the presence of sodium ( Figure 1B ).",

The magnitude of the fluorescence change of mGDP after AlF x addition suggested a major conformational change such as a close juxtaposition of the G-domains. We thus measured the nucleotide-dependent oligomerisation state of the latter in presence of various ions. As MnmE is stably dimerised due to the N-terminal domain, it shows no significant shift in the elution profile when using GDP or GDP \u00feAlF x in NaCl and KCl-containing buffers (not shown). Furthermore, when using NaCl, DN-MnmE elutes as a monomer with an apparent molecular mass of 69 kDa in the presence of GDP or GDP-AlF x ( Figure 1D ). With KCl, however, DN-MnmE forms a dimer (115 kDa apparent molecular mass) in the presence of GDP-AlF x ( Figure 1D ), but not with GDP alone. This property is retained for the isolated G-domain, demonstrating that the G-domains form a stable, potassium-dependent dimer (38 kDa) in the presence of GDP-AlF x , but not GDP (24 kDa). We additionally analysed the dimerisation behaviour for the isolated G-domain in the presence of potassium using the triphosphate analogue GTPgS (see Supplementary Figure 2 ). These studies suggest that GTP-and potassiumdependent dimerisation is required for efficient GTP hydrolysis. As GTP and GTPgS (rate constant: 0.42/min) are hydrolysed during gel filtration, we used a mutant E282A that shows a strongly reduced hydrolysis activity (see below). As expected, GTP but not GDP induces dimerisation of DN-MnmE in the presence of potassium (Supplementary Figure  3) . Summarising, GTP as well as the transition state mimic GDP-AlF x induce a potassium-dependent dimerisation via the G-domain of MnmE.",

The protein shows a sevenstranded b-sheet with four a-helices, as compared to the canonical six b-strands and five a-helices in the apo-form. This is due to a remarkable conformational change whereby helix Ga4 is converted into a b-strand (Gb con ). Owing to the rearrangement of switch II, there is a large change in Gb2/3 and an even larger one in Ga2, which is elongated by two additional turns and tilted by approximately 33 degree compared to the apo-form ( Figure 2B ).

The latter residue is totally conserved and could potentially activate the nucleophilic water in a way similar to the mechanism suggested for F1-ATPase (see discussion).",

            "text": "There is an additional strong electron density peak located between the b-phosphate and the AlF 4 \u00c0 , which we assign to a potassium ion (see below). It is coordinated to the mainchain CO of T245 and I247 that are located in switch I and precede the 249 GTTRD 253 motif. We named this region (245-248) of switch I the K-loop. It contacts potassium and forms a cap that shields the ion from solvent. The hexagonal coordination of potassium is complemented by the side-chain CO of Asn226 (P-loop), the aand b-phosphate oxygens of GDP, where the latter represents the former b\u00c0g-bridging oxygen of GTP and a fluoride ion ( Figure 4A and B). The coordination bond lengths of the potassium ion to MnmE and the phosphates of GDP are between 2.67 and 2.99 \u00c5 , typical for the coordination of potassium (Supplementary Figure 4) . The coordination to AlF 4 \u00c0 is weaker with a distance of 3.34 \u00c5 . To further confirm the position of the potassium ion, we crystallised the G-domain by replacing KCl with RbCl, which has similar biochemical effects. The incorporation of Rb \u00fe allowed collection of an anomalous data set owing to the anomalous scattering behaviour of Rb \u00fe . The anomalous density of the cation is shown in Figure 4C , contoured at 2s, with a 2F O \u00c0F C map surrounding the GDP-AlF x and Mg 2 \u00fe . As expected, the anomalous signal overlaps the position assigned to the potassium-binding site. The active site structure of MnmE in the transition state provides an explanation for the potassium-induced increase of activity. By adding another positive charge to the active site, the b-phosphate is surrounded by a total of three positively charged moieties: Lys229 from the P-loop, the bivalent magnesium and the monovalent potassium ion ( Figure 4B ). When viewed along the axis from the attacking water to the AlF 4 \u00c0 , the positive charges form a planar triangle around what represents the former b\u00c0g-bridging oxygen of GTP. Mg 2 \u00fe and Lys neutralise the negative charges of phosphates in the ground state, whereas potassium, which is not required for binding of GTP, additionally reduces the developing negative charge in a presumed associative transition state. The GTPase-activating function of potassium is further supported by the superimposition with the Ras-RasGAPstructure (1WQ1; Scheffzek et al, 1997; Figure 4D ), where the potassium ion is located at the position of the 'arginine finger' (Arg789) guanidinium group in RasGAP, shown to be responsible for a 2000-fold acceleration of the Ras GTPase. Potassium binding also stabilises the dimer of the G-domains by inducing a number of conformational changes. The most relevant is the rearrangement of helix Ga2, the first turn of which contains the conserved residue Glu282 implicated in catalysis by a proton relay system. In the superimposition ( Figure 4D ), the side-chain oxygen of Gln61 in Ras is very close to the bridging water in MnmE (1.3 \u00c5 ) . Thus, the function of Gln61 to orient the nucleophilic water is taken over by Glu282 and the bridging water in MnmE. As GAPs like RasGAP and RhoGAP also act by repositioning and/or stabilising the crucial catalytic glutamine in Ras/Rho, this argues for potassium being the major GTPase-activating element for MnmE, although the details of mechanism are profoundly different.",

The first class of mutants concerns mutations of residues forming the dimer interface such as I243, D253, L255, the second E282, which is assumed to be involved in catalysis and seems to have no function in dimer formation. As N226 in the P-loop contacts potassium, its mutation should disrupt ion binding and thus affect both dimerisation and catalytic activity. We obtained crystals of a different space group in (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4 that contained an ammonium ion instead of a potassium ion in the active site, but showed the same dimeric structure as the potassium ion bound form. As ammonium shows comparable GTP hydrolysis and mGDP-AlF x -binding activity (results not shown), we reasoned that an N226K mutant might position its N-e ammonium group into the active site and show a potassium-independent fast GTPase activity.",

For wt DN-MnmE (black), besides the signal due to nucleotide binding we monitor an additional fluorescence increase correlated with dimerisation and an amplitude change from 1.0 to 1.4 (compare Figure 5A and C), and a slower decay after hydrolysis due to dissociation of the G-domains. The N226A mutant, where potassium binding should be compromised, shows no additional fluorescence increase beyond that for nucleotide binding, whereas the E282A and E282Q mutants (cyan) show both fast fluorescence changes, confirming that dimerisation is not influenced, but only a very slow decay.

The reaction is complete after 6-8 s (rate constant 47.4/min), well in line with the fluorescence data (compare Figure 5C and D) . The E282A and Q mutants were analysed with HPLC and show a 1925-and 371-fold reduction in k cat , respectively, whereas the other mutants show an intermediate phenotype (Table IV) . As neither potassium binding nor dimerisation in the presence of GTP is influenced by these mutations, whereas AlF xmediated transition state formation is ( Figure 5A and B) , we conclude that E282 has an important purely catalytic function, such as that of a general base that acts to activate or stabilise the nucleophilic water via an intermediate water molecule. According to this, mutation of E282 to Q should be less drastic than the alanine mutation as it should still be able to stabilise the hydrogen-bonding network. In the GAP catalysed reaction of Ras and Rho, a catalytic glutamine stabilises the position of the attacking water directly, and its mutation drastically reduces the reaction rate.",

As described by Martinez-Vicente et al (2005) , the two arginine residues R252 and R275 are not directly involved in catalysis, which is supported by our data. In the structure, R252 is located in the dimer interface, responsible for part of the binding specificity, whereas R275 stabilises the position of the catalytic E282 by polar interactions.

            "text": "Phosphoryl transfer reactions are most frequently used in biology. This is due to the fact that phosphate monoesters or phospho-anhydrides are kinetically stable due to high-energy barriers, which require a delicate enzymatic machinery to achieve fast reaction rates. GTP-binding proteins have been shown to adopt a variety of mechanisms to accelerate cleavage of GTP, which is intrinsically very slow and is stimulated in a variety of ways. Here, we show that a potassium ion is a central element required for a stable dimerisation of the G-domains of MnmE and its stimulated hydrolysis. Dimerisation stabilises the switch region and reorients the catalytic Glu282, which in turn positions and/or stabilises the attacking water. As mutation of Glu282 to alanine reduces the hydrolysis rate by 2000-fold as compared to the 370-fold reduction of E282Q, we conclude that Glu282 may act as general base or to just stabilise the attacking water. A similar mechanism of water-mediated proton transfer to an acidic side chain has been proposed for the F1-ATPase using computational simulation (Dittrich et al, 2004) . In that scenario, the proton is eventually transferred to the g-phosphate similar to what has also been discussed as substrate-assisted catalysis for Ras and Rab (Wittinghofer, 2006) . General base catalysed proton transfer is also proposed for other phosphoryl transfer reactions such as those of protein kinases, where the mutation of an invariant Asp completely inactivates the enzyme (Gibbs and Zoller, 1991; Johnson et al, 1996) . In previously analysed GTPase reactions, there are two positive charges that are absolutely required for the reaction, the Mg 2 \u00fe ion forming a bi-dentate coordination with the b-g-phosphate oxygens and the totally conserved lysine residue from the P-loop. The GTPase-activating factor for the MnmE-mediated GTP hydrolysis is a suitably positioned potassium ion, which is hexa-coordinated by the nucleotide and residues from the P-loop and K-loop. Our experiments show that the binding site is suitable for monovalent cations with an ionic radius in the range of 138 to 152 pm (K \u00fe : 138 pm; NH 4 \u00fe : 144 pm; Rb \u00fe : 152 pm). Cations smaller or larger in size (Na \u00fe : 99 pm; Cs \u00fe : 169 pm) do either not bind or do not have the effects described for potassium. The potassium as a GTPase-activating element has so far never been described for any GTP-binding protein. It has however been observed in the structures of the ATPase domain of the Hsc70 and GroEL chaperones. For many small molecule kinases, an influence of monovalent cations on the enzymatic activity was shown biochemically (reviewed in Suelter, 1970) . The ATPase of Hsc70 is stimulated 5-10-fold by potassium and the structure of the N-terminal ATPase-fragment of Hsc70 (Wilbanks and McKay, 1995; Sousa and McKay, 1998) shows two potassium-binding sites close to the phosphates. One of these is coordinated by the b-phosphate, whereas the second is located close to the free-phosphate/g-phosphate. Interestingly, the site 1 potassium in Hsc70 replaces a conserved lysine residue in actin that contacts the a-b-phosphates comparable to the P-loop lysine in GNBPs that coordinates the b-g-phosphates. The closest structural match to the potassium of MnmE is found in the ADP-AlF x structure of GroE (1PCQ, Chaudhry et al, 2003; 1KP8, Wang and Boisvert, 2003) . In GroE, the monovalent cation induces a 10 4 -fold increase in ATP hydrolysis.",

Alanine mutation of the 249 GTTRD 253 affected the GTPase, AlF x -induced complex formation and tRNA modification activity of MnmE, although dimerisation of the G-domains was not described. Considering the central role of the 249 GTTRD 253 motif for the dimerisation interface as deduced from the structure ( Figure 3A) , it becomes obvious that mutations of these and neighbouring residues have an indirect effect on the GTPase activity ( Figure 5 ). Structural analysis also suggests why the G249A (20-fold) and T251A (92-fold) mutations have the most drastic effect on GTPase activity. Gly249 assumes the role of the canonical Gly residue from the DxxG motif. It is bound to the g-phosphate (here AlF 4 \u00c0 ) via a main-chain H-bond and is additionally involved in orienting the attacking water (Wat2). Gly273 from the switch II DxxG motif in turn orients the bridging water molecule (Wat1, Figure 4A ). As proposed by Martinez-Vicente et al, Thr251 (and not Thr250) does indeed correspond to the canonical threonine from switch I and contacts Mg 2 \u00fe and AlF 4 \u00c0 (corresponding to the g-phosphate).",

This would require the G-domains of native MnmE to come closer to each other than observed in the structural model of nucleotide-free full-length MnmE (Scrima et al, 2005 ; 1XZP/1XZQ), with a distance of 54 \u00c5 between glycines (G223) in the P-loop, which is reduced to 32 \u00c5 in the GDP-AlF x structure ( Figure 6B ). In order for the G-domains to move into place, one would have to propose a major conformational change. This could be mediated by rigid body movements of the domains relative to each other using the linker between the domains as hinges ( Figure 6A , black arrows). Structural independence of the domains is supported by the fact that the DN-MnmE and the G-domain can be isolated and retain the enzymatic properties of the full-length protein. Proteolytic digestion of MnmE (Yim et al, 2003) results in fragments of approximately 39 and 36 kDa that could correspond to MnmE molecules lacking most (residues 1-102) or all (1-118) of the N-terminal fragment, and has also been found in proteolysed crystals of MnmE (Scrima et al, 2005) . Proteolysis in the presence of GTP leads to additional proteolytic fragments, supporting a nucleotide-dependent conformational reorientation between the domains.",

            "text": "GTP hydrolysis of mutants was analysed by HPLC (Beckman-Coulter, System Gold). Nucleotides were separated on a hydrophobic C18-column (Beckman-Coulter) with 100 mM potassiumphosphate pH 6.5, 10 mM tert-butyl-ammonium-bromide and 7.5% acetonitril as polar, mobile phase. Reaction conditions for The potassium-dependent dimerisation of the G-domains during GTP hydrolysis (represented by GTP* in E) could lead to an upward movement of the helical domains (D, red arrows), thereby bringing the C-terminal catalytic cysteine (represented as a thiolate-anion S \u00c0 in yellow) and the C1-group donor 5-formyl-THF (magenta) in juxtaposition allowing the activation of the uridine base (U) and the formyl transfer. the single-turnover conditions were analogous to the quench-flow experiment. In total, 100 mM of protein was incubated with 80 mM of nucleotide in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTE at 201C. At various time points, 30 ml aliquots were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to stop the reaction. Aliquots were incubated at 951C for 2 min, denatured protein was removed by centrifugation (1 min, 13000 r.p.m.) and the supernatant applied to the HPLC. For multi-turnover analysis, 1 mM of protein was incubated with 200 mM GTP in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 5 mM DTE at 201C containing 100 mM of the respective salt. Further treatment of the samples was analogous to the single-turnover experiment.",
