            "text": "The virus particles themselves are tiny, with the sizes of most virions at the limit of the resolution of even the best light microscopes. Most viruses are on the order of 50-200 nm in diameter, though the smallest parvoviruses can measure less than 30 nm, while poxviruses or rhabdovirus particles like the vesicular stomatitis virus can be 0.3-to 0.4-mm long. Filoviruses such as Ebola or Marburg virus or filamentous forms of the influenza virus have diameters of about 80-100 nm, but can reach lengths of several mm. Viruses can be localized by fluorescence methods using specific antibodies directed against viral proteins, or viral components coupled to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or its derivatives. This allows virus-infected cells to be analyzed by FACS methods or by immunofluorescence staining to reveal the distribution of major viral components, but these techniques cannot reveal much about structure. Viruses can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy as small spots, though the resolution is rarely suYcient to determine whether fluorescent spots represent virions, aggregates of viral proteins, or subviral particles. When carefully controlled, fluorescence methods can sometimes allow virus particles to be counted (Pizzato et al., 1999) , while more recent multicolor fluorescence coincidence detection methods allow quantitative measurements of the antigenic composition of individual virions (Li et al., 2004) . However, a detailed analysis virus structures requires higher resolution methods such as electron microscopy (EM). At the simplest level, negative staining of virus preparations can reveal some features of virus structure, size, and heterogeneity, and this can be of diagnostic value (Curry et al., 2006) . More detail is revealed when virus preparations are rapidly frozen and the vitrified specimens examined by cryo-EM. When combined with data from X-ray diVraction studies, or with electron tomography or single-particle analysis of isolated virions, highly detailed virus structures can be derived at near atomic resolution (Briggs et al., 2006; Grunewald et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "As obligate intracellular parasites, viruses are dependent on living host cells for their replication. The viruses must first identify and adhere to a suitable host cell, which occurs through interactions of viral surface components or envelope glycoproteins with specific cellular receptors. The viral DNA or RNA genome must then access the relevant replication machineries of the host cells (Marsh and Helenius, 2006) . Enveloped viruses have to fuse with a cellular membrane, allowing a naked virus core to be released into the cytoplasm. Further uncoating reactions and/or transport of the core to the cell's nucleus may also be required. Even the complex poxviruses, which carry their own machineries enabling them to carry out transcription and replication in the cytoplasm, need to access the appropriate location inside the cell, for example, in the vicinity of the endoplasmic reticulum (Schramm and Krijnse Locker, 2005) . Once access to the replicative machineries has been established, the viral genetic material induces the host cell to synthesize the components required for the production of new virus particles, as well as virusspecific enzymes or regulatory proteins that may reprogram the cells' activities. New virus particles are assembled, and, for enveloped viruses, acquire a lipid membrane by budding through a cellular membrane. Many cellular organelles have been shown to be involved in viral replication and assembly, including the plasma membrane, components of the biosynthetic pathway [endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus or the trans-Golgi network (TGN)], and endosomes. These compartments are exploited in diVerent ways and to varying extents by diVerent viruses. Some viruses subvert the host cells' normal functions, perhaps generating new virus-induced structures or modifying normal cellular organelles to produce extensive ''virus factories.'' These processes are most eVectively studied with the electron microscope. The characteristic morphologies allow the easy identification of mature and assembling virus particles in cells, and the eVects on the cell's own structure can be detected alongside. The EM techniques are even more powerful when combined with immunolabeling protocols, in particular immunolabeling of cryosections.",

Such studies require very high input numbers of virus particles, and since often only a fraction of the visible virus particles are actually infectious, nonproductive pathways might also be visualized.

To minimize disturbance to the cells, it is best to prepare a double-strength fixative (i.e., 4% formaldehyde/3% glutaraldehyde) at the temperature of the cells and add this directly into the culture medium. High-pressure freezing, followed by freeze-substitution with aldehyde fixatives may give even better preservation (Murk et al., 2003; Studer et al., 2001) .

Distinct stages in the replication of HCMV have been documented by EM, as illustrated in Fig. 1 . The viral capsid proteins move into the nucleus, where they assemble into 100-nm-diameter icosahedral cores that are then filled with the viral DNA to produce nucleocapsids (Fig. 1A) . The nucleocapsids are thought to leave the nucleus by budding through the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope, before fusing and de-enveloping at the outer nuclear membrane, so that naked capsids are released into the cytoplasm. This idea is supported by EM analysis, where enveloped capsids can sometimes be observed in dilations of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 1B) . In the cytoplasm, the particles acquire a layer of tegument proteins, a process that often occurs at characteristic cytoplasmic virus factories (Fig. 1C) , identified as accumulations of electron-dense tegument proteins in the vicinity of the centrioles/microtubule organizing center. The virus factories also tend to contain various membrane vesicles and are often surrounded by enlarged mitochondria. The virus particles acquire their final envelope by budding into characteristic crescent-shaped membrane vesicles (Fig. 1D) , and simultaneously become enclosed in small membrane-limited vacuoles. Fusion of these vacuoles with the plasma membrane leads to the release of HCMV virions into the extracellular space. The morphology of the fully assembled extracellular virus particle (150-to 200-nm diameter) shows the viral envelope, coated with a layer of the viral glycoprotein complexes (Fig. 1E ). Three types of particles can be distinguished on HCMV-infected cells, including enveloped nucleocapsids, empty capsid particles that lack the DNA genome [giving rise to noninfectious enveloped particles (NIEPs)], and cytoplasmic aggregates of tegument proteins, which produce enveloped ''dense bodies'' (see Fig. 1F ). On infected human fibroblasts, we have also occasionally observed HCMV particles within or (B) The capsids bud into the lumen of the nuclear envelope, acquiring a first membrane from the inner nuclear envelope (black arrowheads). This membrane is lost during fusion with the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope, so that naked capsids are released into the cytoplasm. (C) A cytoplasmic ''virus budding into multivesicular late endosomes (Fig. 1G ). Various HCMV glycoproteins, including several viral chemokine receptor-like proteins are also located on endosomes and multivesicular bodies and may be incorporated into the viral membrane during the budding step (Fraile-Ramos et al., 2001 , 2002 .",

            "text": "Retroviruses, including the primate lentiviruses HIV and SIV, are single-stranded RNA viruses with a much smaller genome and simpler structure than the herpesviruses. The two copies of the unspliced 9.8-kB RNA genome contain three major genes, gag, pol, and env; these code for the structural proteins, viral enzymes (reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease), and the envelope glycoprotein (Env), respectively. There are also sequences for a small number of accessory proteins (Freed, 2004) . Like other enveloped viruses, HIV and SIV acquire their membrane by budding through a cellular membrane ( Fig. 2A ). Hence all of the components that make up an infectious virus particle need to be brought together at this membrane budding site in a coordinated manner (Pelchen-Matthews et al., 2004) . Virus assembly is driven primarily by the Gag polyprotein that contains all of the structural proteins of the virus, namely the matrix protein (MA) that forms a protein shell immediately beneath the viral membrane, the capsid protein (CA) that condenses into the truncated cone-shaped core that is characteristic of HIV and SIV particles (see Fig. 2A ), and the nucleocapsid (NC) that stabilizes the viral RNA genome. Gag alone is able to bind membranes, to deform them into a bud and later a stalked ''lollipop''-type structure, and the presence of Gag can be visualized as a thick, membrane-associated, electron-dense layer at the budding site ( Fig. 2A) . Eventually, a scission reaction releases the budding virion from the host cell, and, concomitant with or shortly after release, the viral protease cleaves the Gag polyprotein, allowing CA and NC to condense into the cone-shaped viral core of mature virions. Indeed, cells transfected with the gag gene alone will produce virus-like particles (VLPs) with morphological features identical to immature SIV buds (Fig. 2B ), but in the absence of the protease these particles cannot mature. factory'' composed of electron-dense accumulations of viral tegument proteins (asterisk) and various membrane vesicles. HCMV capsid particles acquire a layer of tegument and then proceed to wrap into the membrane vesicles. (D) Detail of the envelopment of tegumented capsids at cytoplasmic membranes near the Golgi complex (Go). The membrane vesicles are deformed into characteristic crescents (black arrowheads). This leads to the production of mature enveloped HCMV particles within cytoplasmic vacuoles (white arrow).

The white and black arrows indicate envelopment of an empty capsid and a DNA-filled nucleocapsid, respectively, while the asterisk marks an enveloped tegument aggregate or ''dense body.'' Note also the empty capsid (white arrowhead) in the nucleus (N), which lacks the tegument layer. (G) Two multivesicular late endosomes (1, 2) and a lysosome containing multilamellar membranes (L). Endosome 2 contains several assembled HCMV virions. Images were taken from cells infected for 72 h (A and B), 96 h (E, F, and G), or 120 h (C and D). Scale bars \u00bc 200 nm. We have analyzed VLP assembly driven by the Gag protein in COS cells transfected with the SIVmac239 gag gene, or with a chimeric Gag-GFP construct. In both cases, the cells released VLPs, which could be isolated and purified on sucrose gradients and which contained intact membrane envelopes as judged by their resistance to digestion with proteinase K. The Gag-GFP particles could be visualized by fluorescence microscopy as brightly fluorescent spots at the cell surface and as larger aggregates at intracellular sites.",

Detailed analysis revealed a number of diVerences between particles budding from Gag or Gag-GFP-transfected cells. VLPs produced by Gag-transfected cells had a fairly homogeneous size distribution of 110-125 nm and consisted of a membrane envelope with an internal electron-dense protein layer and an electron-lucent center (Fig. 2B) . Characteristically, the protein layer ended with a sharp line of electron density next to the lumen, similar to the appearance of immature virions budding from SIV-infected cells (cf. Fig. 2A , arrow). Particles from Gag-GFP-transfected cells showed a wider size distribution (110-160 nm, with occasional even larger particles) and significant shape heterogeneity, including oval or elongated particles (Fig. 2C ). The electron-dense layer at the budding sites appeared thicker (31 AE 7 nm as compared to 23 AE 3 nm for Gag buds) and lacked the electron-dense line next to the particle lumen. In addition, the protein coat often showed a banded pattern with a regular periodicity of about 50-60 nm, both under the plasma membrane and in the budding or budded particles ( Fig. 2C and D). Such interruptions in the protein layer were never seen for Gag VLPs and are likely to result from steric interference to Gag packing by the GFP moiety, which represents approximately one-third of the chimeric Gag-GFP protein. Aberrant Gag-GFP-budding structures have also been observed for HIV (Larson et al., 2005; Muller et al., 2004) , though budding particles of normal appearance were seen in cells coexpressing Gag-GFP together with unmodified Gag. Such cells still release green fluorescent VLPs, allowing correlative light microscopy/EM analysis (Larson et al., 2005) .",

Again EM analysis has been useful in defining the stages of budding arrest, and the eVects of mutations in the viral late domains or of dominant negative versions of the cellular ESCRT (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport) proteins (Pornillos et al., 2003; von Schwedler et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "The distribution of virus buds can also be useful in defining the sites of virus assembly. For example, SIV and HIV assemble primarily at the plasma membrane of T cells, T-cell lines, or a variety of model tissue culture cell lines. However, intracellular vacuoles filled with virus particles can also occasionally be observed, both on SIV-infected T cells (Fig. 2E ) and on COS cells expressing high levels of the SIV Gag protein (Fig. 2F ). This is similar to the assembly of HIV in primary human monocyte-derived macrophages, which accumulate large vacuoles packed with virus particles (Gendelman et al., 1988) . But on these static EM images, it is unclear where these intracellular viruses have assembled: virions near the cell surface might have been formed at intracellular locations and secreted, while intracellular virions could have been taken up by the cell, for example, by endocytosis. The presence of budding profiles or immature virions (Fig. 2E) can give an indication that viruses are actually assembling at a particular site, but such images are comparatively rare. Although the oligomerizing Gag protein can easily be identified on plastic sections, the presence of other viral proteins, such as Env, in the viruses is more diYcult to establish. A further limitation of TEM of Epon sections is that it can be hard to identify the nature of the intracellular viruscontaining structures, for example, whether they are part of the endosome/lysosome system, or whether they represent structures modified by the virus, such as swollen Golgi cisternae or enlarged TGN vesicles. These questions can in part be addressed by immunolabeling of infected cells with antibodies against various intracellular markers. At least in the case of HIV assembly in macrophages, immunolabeling methods have demonstrated that the intracellular virus-containing vacuoles contain some markers for late endosomes and lysosomes (Pelchen-Matthews et al., 2003; Raposo et al., 2002) .",

For example, HIV may contain up to 5000 Gag molecules per particle (Briggs et al., 2004) . In addition, as these proteins tend to be highly immunogenic, a range of antibodies or sera against viral components are available commercially or through research facilities such as the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. Many antibodies recognize the viral proteins in their native state and give strong signals in immunolabeling reactions. To identify cellular compartments, it is necessary to perform double labeling experiments with antibodies directed against specific marker proteins, and this requires postembedding immunolabeling protocols.",

Hence this method is not generally recommended. Embedding in more hydrophilic resins such as Lowicryl or LR White retains more antigenic epitopes, but the preservation of cellular membranes in these resins is poor. This is a particular disadvantage if enveloped viruses are studied, as the interaction with the cell's membrane systems is critical to virus production. By far the best option for antigen preservation is to maintain the biological material in its hydrated state, which is achieved by using vitreous ice as the embedding medium for cryosectioning. Cellular membranes are well preserved in this technique-they tend to be negatively stained and appear as white lines.",

However, when working with infected cell preparations, the fixation step also provides a useful way to inactivate the viruses. We routinely use a fixative containing 4% formaldehyde (prepared from paraformaldehyde and added to the cells as a double strength, i.e., 8%, fixative as detailed above). As glutaraldehyde is a crosslinking fixative, it can improve cell preservation and the sectioning properties of the embedded, frozen cells, even at low concentrations ( 0.2%), but even these low amounts can destroy some antigenic epitopes. Fixed cells are rinsed in a glycinecontaining buVer before embedding in gelatin, and embedded cell pellets are dissected into blocks suitable for sectioning, infiltrated with 2.3-M sucrose as a cryoprotectant and frozen onto specimen pins by plunging into liquid N 2 . Specimen blocks can be stored in a nitrogen bank for extended times, allowing further analysis at later dates or when new antibodies become available.",

Protein A reacts strongly with antibodies from a number of species, including rabbit, human (but not human IgG3), and some mouse IgGs. However, for rat or goat primary antibodies, and for most mouse antibodies, a bridging antibody is required. This can give the appearance of clustered or clumpy labeling. Protein A conjugates can also be used to stain cells expressing Fc receptors: as the protein A-binding site on antibodies is located in the Fc region, PAG will only bind to those antibody molecules bound to their specific antigens (with their protein A-binding site exposed) and not those that have been captured by Fc receptors, where this site is hidden.",

By contrast, 5-nm-gold particles can only be seen clearly at primary magnifications of >25,000\u00c2, they are easier to see on weakly contrasted sections, and can be missed if the contrast is high or if they are located near more electron-dense structures.",

            "text": "Some of our own studies on the assembly of VLPs from the SIV Gag protein illustrate applications of immunolabeling of cryosections (Fig. 3) . The VLP-budding profiles in COS cells transfected with the Gag-GFP chimera were labeled with antibodies directed against the SIV MA or CA proteins ( Fig. 3A and B, respectively), or with an antiserum against GFP (Fig. 3C) . These antibodies show finely distinct labeling patterns, demonstrating the resolution of the EM-immunolabeling method: antibodies against MA label the buds immediately beneath the membrane, consistent with the location of MA at the periphery of the VLPs, while anti-CA antibodies stain more centrally over the electron-dense Gag layer that is polymerizing under the membrane. Both the anti-MA and anti-CA antibodies are mouse IgG1s requiring a rabbit anti-mouse IgG-bridging antibody (an extra incubation step between the primary antibody and PAG in the protocol above). This gives the possibility to amplify the signal, as several bridging antibody molecules may bind to the primary antibody, and results in a more clustered distribution of the gold particles. The rabbit anti-GFP antibody interacts directly with PAG, and no bridging antibody was used (Fig. 3C ). Labeling here is by single gold particles. This is particularly striking over an area of flat polymerizing Gag-GFP, where the striations in the Gag-GFP layer are decorated with evenly spaced gold particles, located just below the electron-dense Gag layer. Since the length of an antibody molecule is $9 nm, gold particles would be expected to be located within 10 nm of the antigen in labeling reactions with a single primary antibody. If a bridging antibody is used, this will reduce the space resolution. While the orientation of the primary and bridging antibodies relative to the section may vary, for quantitative analysis it is generally assumed that the antigen of interest is located within $20 nm of the surface of the gold particle. Because of their characteristic structures, VLPs can be recognized in transfected cells even without immunolabeling, especially for the Gag VLPs, where more regular particles are formed. Since VLPs and budding figures are observed both at the plasma membrane and in some intracellular vacuoles, immunolabeling with antibodies against cellular markers can be used to identify these intracellular structures. Here, the VLP-containing vacuoles were labeled by antibodies against the late endosomal protein CD63 (Fig. 3D ) or the lipid lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA) (Kobayashi et al., 1998) , which accumulates on the internal membranes of late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 3E) . The presence of these markers identifies the intracellular vacuoles as late endosomes. Some VLPs appear to be directly labeled with gold particles, suggesting that CD63 or LBPA can themselves be incorporated into the budding virion membrane. By contrast, VLPs budded at the cell surface are not stained by the anti-LBPA antibody (Fig. 3F) , indicating that there may be biochemical diVerences between VLPs budded at the cell surface or at the membrane of endosomes.",

As for other retroviruses, the SIV Env glycoprotein is composed of two subunits, the surface glycoprotein (SU, gp120), which is noncovalently attached to the transmembrane subunit (TM, gp41). TM contains a long cytoplasmic domain of around 150-180 amino acids, depending on the virus strain. This long cytoplasmic domain is required for virus transmission in vivo, but when some SIV isolates, such as SIVmac239, are passaged in human tissue culture cell lines, they spontaneously truncate the cytoplasmic domain and express an Env protein with a shorter cytoplasmic tail of only around 20 amino acids. Truncation of the Env TM cytoplasmic domain can increase Env incorporation into virions (Johnston et al., 1993; Zingler and Littman, 1993) . We have examined CEMx174 cells chronically infected with SIVmac239 or with a variant expressing an Env protein with a truncated TM protein (SIVmac239/251Tail). Ultrathin cryosections were stained with an antibody against the V3 loop on the SIV SU protein (Edinger et al., 2000) . As shown in Fig. 3G and H, there was only sparse gold labeling of the budded SIVmac239 particles (Fig. 3G ), while virions with the truncated Env TM protein were much more strongly labeled (Fig. 3H) . Consistent with the exposure of Env at the surface of the particles, the virions were decorated with PAG on the outside of the virions. Indeed, the abundant Env glycoproteins on these particles was visualized as a fuzzy electron-dense layer (Fig. 3H) . Since gold particles appeared as discrete spots on the images, they could be counted to give an estimate of the Env densities on virions. This suggested that, while SIVmac239 viruses were labeled with only 1.2 gold particles per virion (Fig. 3G) , the short tail variant (SIVmac239/251Tail) contained 8.7 gold particles per virion (Fig. 3H) , suggesting that this SIV variant incorporates more than seven times as much Env as the wild-type SIVmac239, in agreement with the analysis of purified SIV particles by HPLC or electron tomography studies, which reveal $8to 10-fold higher incorporation of truncated Env proteins into SIV (Chertova et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2003) . However, immunolabeling of cryosections oVers the possibility of analyzing the composition of individual virus particles, rather than bulk populations, and may be used to compare, for example, viruses budded at intracellular sites or at the cell surface.",

This is in broad agreement with the values previously determined for the labeling of the Semliki Forest virus spike protein complex in infected baby hamster kidney cells (GriYths and Hoppeler, 1986) , or for labeling of 5 0 -nucleotidase at the cell surface (Howell et al., 1987) . The high labeling of virions here probably results from the use of a rabbit anti-mouse bridging antibody in the staining reaction, which gives some amplification, and from the fact that the stained virus particles are located in the extracellular space rather than embedded in the cytoplasmic matrix. The penetration of gold probes into cryosections depends on the density of the organelles, allowing reagents to penetrate well into some structures, while access to dense structures such as secret ory granule s may be severe ly restrict ed ( Slot et al ., 1989 ; Chapter 21 by Ladinsky and Howell, this volume). Labeling eYciencies vary for diVerent antibody/antigen combinations, and depend on the size of the gold probes (higher labeling eYciencies are obtained with smaller gold probes), while steric eVects may reduce the access of antibodies or gold probes at sites of high antigen density. While labeling eYciencies of around 10% or less can be acceptable for the study of viruses or virus-infected cells, where viral proteins are expressed in abundance, ineYcient detection can be a problem in the study of cellular antigens that may be present at much lower copy number.",

This is conveniently done with semithin (0.5 mm) cryosections that are cut with glass knives at \u00c080 C, picked up on a droplet of 2.3-M sucrose, and placed on glass slides. The slides should be marked by scoring small (5-mm diameter) circles to indicate the area where the sections will be placed. A number of sections from diVerent specimens can be placed sideby-side and screened together with the same antibody. Immunolabeling is performed on the slides by placing drops of solutions over the sections. Fixative is quenched by incubation in a solution of glycine and NH 4 Cl as above. For sections fixed in glutaraldehyde fixatives, a brief incubation in a freshly prepared solution of sodium borohydride is also required to reduce the autofluorescence of glutaraldehyde-fixed tissue. Normally, there is no need to permeabilize the cells, as many organelles are cut open during the sectioning; however, if desired, buVers containing detergents such as Triton X-100 or Saponin may be used. When these samples are stained, good images without ''out-of-focus'' fluorescence from adjacent layers in the cell can be obtained, even with a standard fluorescence microscope. Immunofluorescence thus allows a rapid assessment of the specimens: it can give an indication of the proportion of virus-infected cells and, in situations where virus assembly occurs in a restricted location, of the number of cell profiles sectioned through the area of interest. The immunofluorescence patterns will give a first indication of the location of structures of interest, antibody reactivities can be conveniently assessed and antibodies titered, while double-staining studies can give a first indication of the compartments involved.",

Double staining with PAG reagents requires sequential incubations, but it does sometimes permit double staining even with primary antibodies from the same species. These doublestaining protocols rely on the fact that the protein A-binding site on antibodies is easily inactivated by a brief incubation in glutaraldehyde (5-10 min in 1-2% glutaraldehyde; we have found that a similar incubation in formaldehyde fixatives is not suYcient to block later cross-reactions).

Since all colloidal gold preparations contain some spread of particle sizes, combinations of 5-and 15-nm gold particles give the most unambiguous distinction between the labels. Commercial preparations of 10-and 15-nm gold both contain a small proportion of 12-nm particles, so it may be diYcult to identify the antibody associated with some individual particles. Given the ease with which large gold particles can be located at the EM, the biggest gold particles should be used to label structures of particular interest, for example, virus particles or a marker for a rare compartment. Due to steric interference and masking of sites, the eYciency of immunolabeling is reduced for the second or later antibody incubations, and hence the most critical staining reactions should be done first. For steric reasons, there is also less cross-reaction if the smallest gold particles are used before larger conjugates in the staining sequence. Further restrictions arise if one antibody is sensitive to the glutaraldehyde fixation step: such an antibody then has to be used as the first primary antibody. To allow interpretations of the labeling patterns, antigen distributions should be carefully documented in single-staining experiments, and all staining experiments need to be carefully controlled, for example, by using the ''wrong'' first antibodies or omitting reagents. The most informative controls are provided by cell lines lacking an antigen of interest, for example, after depletion by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or, when studying virus assembly, by uninfected cells, by pre-absorbing antibodies with their antigen, and by omitting the second primary antibody.",

EM Analysis of Viral Morphogenesis MIIC, the compartment where major histocompatibility class II molecules are loaded with peptides. Often only a fraction of the macrophages in a culture are infected with virus, which may be found in a restricted location in the cell, so screening samples by immunofluorescence (see Fig. 4 and above) is essential. Here, the preliminary immunofluorescence studies suggested that the virus vacuoles contain the tetraspanin CD9. This was further investigated in EM double-labeling experiments. CD9 is located primarily at the plasma membrane, with rare staining also of intracellular vacuoles (cf. Fig. 4B ), hence we wanted to mark the location of CD9 with large gold particles (PAG 15 nm). However, the CD9 antibody was extremely sensitive to glutaraldehyde fixation, with even a 5-min incubation in 1% glutaraldehyde eliminating most of the signal. Thus, we used a protocol where staining with anti-CD9/rabbit anti-mouse bridging antibody/15-nm PAG was followed by a rabbit anti-HIV MA antiserum and 5-nm PAG. Virus-containing vacuoles were strongly labeled for CD9, which was frequently located over the virus particles in the lumen of the vacuole or over small vesicles resembling the intralumenal vesicles of multivesicular bodies or ''exosomes'' (Fig. 5A ). The identity of the virus particles was confirmed by their staining with 5-nm PAG.",

This was particularly noticeable when we examined CD9 labeling at the cell surface of uninfected macrophages (which lacked the MA antigen). A number of 5-nm gold particles were still observed, and most of these were located close to (within 20 nm of) a 15-nm PAG particle (Fig. 5A, arrows) . Such cross-reaction would not occur if the smaller gold were used first, as a larger gold identifying the second antigen would be sterically blocked from accessing any surviving PAG-binding sites in the first antibody layer. Given the distinct pattern with which the anti-MA antibody labels virus particles, the cross-reacting gold particles could easily be identified in this study. However, this example serves to illustrate the importance of careful controls in the immunolabeling reactions. Figure 5C shows an example of a triple labeling with three sizes of gold particles. Here sections from HIV-1 BaL -infected macrophages were stained sequentially with three antibodies that are all able to bind PAG directly. Virus particles are identified with a mouse monoclonal antibody against HIV-1 MA and 5-nm PAG, the 10-nm PAG marks the late endosome protein CD63, while a rabbit antiserum and 15-nm PAG were used to detect the lysosomal marker, LAMP-1. Virus particles are clearly decorated with the 5-nm gold particles, and often also labeled with the 10-nm PAG identifying CD63. Indeed, biochemical studies have shown that CD63 is incorporated into the envelope of infectious HIV virions produced by macrophages (Nguyen et al., 2003; Pelchen-Matthews et al., 2003) . This is important because for many viruses, including HIV, only a fraction of the visible particles are infectious, and EM techniques alone cannot distinguish infectious from morphologically normal noninfectious virus particles. Cryosection immunolabeling allows the analysis of virus components, for example, the content of Envs that are essential for infectivity. Nonetheless, it is important to study statistically relevant numbers of Ferns et al., 1987 , provided by Drs. R. B. Ferns and R. S. Tedder through the NIBSC Centralised Facility for AIDS Reagents) and 5-nm PAG, the mouse monoclonal anti-CD63 and 10-nm PAG and a rabbit anti-LAMP-1 (provided by Dr. S. Carlsson, Umea University, Sweden) and 15-nm PAG. The large vacuole is packed with virus particles that are also labeled for CD63, but there is little labeling for LAMP-1. By contrast, a lysosome (L) nearby is strongly labeled for LAMP-1 on its limiting membrane. Scale bars \u00bc 200 nm.",

Hence lipid localization studies can benefit from high-pressure freezing to prepare samples (Mobius et al., 2002) . Cryosections are cut from the frozen specimens and collected with pick-up solutions supplemented with aldehyde fixatives and uranyl acetate to stabilize the membranes. For lipid localizations, the cryosections should be labeled immediately, and it is also advisable to perform the staining incubations on ice to prevent or at least slow the relocation of the lipid components (Downes et al., 2005) . In addition to antibodies, various lipid-binding probes have been described that are useful for EM localization studies, including toxins such as perfringolysin O, which binds cholesterol (Mobius et al., 2002) .

In particular, variations in the ability of diVerent sized gold particles to penetrate cryosections (Slot et al., 1989) , which may depend on the density of the structure to be analyzed, can give rise to diVerent labeling eYciencies over diVerent structures. For example, an antigen at the cell surface may be more accessible, and hence more strongly labeled, than the same molecule within an intracellular organelle, leading to large variations in labeling eYciencies (GriYths and Hoppeler, 1986) ; hence, in some situations, labeling densities can only be used to compare variations in antigen concentration in similar organelles, and EM studies should be supported by, for example, quantitative biochemical analysis from cell fractionation.",

A related technology is the development of gold nanoparticles with defined chemical structures and therefore more uniformity than gold colloids. These particles can be covalently linked to various binding reagents, including antibodies, Fab fragments, ligands, or haptens, and show good stability and a long shelf life.

Cells growing on gridded coverslips can be transfected, infected, or microinjected with GFP chimeras, or engineered virus strains. After imaging in a fluorescent microscope, possibly with live-cell recording of the fluorescent constructs, cells are fixed and embedded, and the same cells can be relocated in the EM and may be imaged, even by tomography. Similar techniques are being developed for preparing cryosections from monolayers of cells , and for relocating the fluorescent cells on immunolabeled cryosections (Koster and Klumperman, 2003) . Correlative methods may also make use of reagents such as FluoroNanogold (nanogold particles as above, that have been modified with a fluorescent probe, either fluorescein or one of the Alexa Fluor dyes). Such reagents can be used to label cells, or even cryosections, for analysis both at the fluorescent light microscope level and subsequently, after silver or gold enhancement, at the EM level. Indeed, ultrathin cryosections may be stained with FluoroNanogold and then silver-enhanced and viewed at the EM, with significantly higher labeling eYciencies than can be obtained with colloidal gold probes (Takizawa and Robinson, 2003) . Fluorescent quantum dots are also reported to be easily visible in the EM and may have similar applications (Giepmans et al., 2005) .",

Particles with characteristic structures are easily identified, while immunolabeling allows quantification of viral components, even in individual virus particles, and comparisons between particles at diVerent locations in the cell or at diVerent stages in viral assembly. For many viruses, a range of specific antibodies are available, while reagents against cellular markers are widely commercially available. Together with the newly developed methods for electron tomography and correlative immunofluorescence studies and EM, huge potential exists to unravel more details of virus assembly in the near future.",
