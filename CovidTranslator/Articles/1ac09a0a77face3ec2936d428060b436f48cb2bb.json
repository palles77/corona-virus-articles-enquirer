            "text": "Cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) evaluation is a mainstay in the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) disease because it is relatively simple to collect and has the potential to provide valuable information. Lesions of the CNS do not consistently cause CSF abnormalities related to the location and extent of the lesion. Although CSF evaluation infrequently provides a defi nitive diagnosis, it may be of benefi t in documenting normal or abnormal features and, in combination with other tests, determining a diagnosis or differential diagnoses (Bohn et al., 2006; Bush et al., 2002; Chrisman, 1992; Cook and DeNicola, 1988; Fenner, 2000; Rand, 1995) . CSF collection is recommended as a part of virtually any diagnostic investigation of CNS disease of unknown cause when contraindications to its collection are not present.",

If the needle hits bone during insertion, slight redirection of the needle cranially or caudally should be attempted to enter the atlanto-occipital space.",

Attachment of a syringe to the needle with aspiration of CSF is not recommended because suction may result in contamination with blood or meningeal cells or obstruction of CSF fl ow by aspirated meningeal trabeculae. Careful aspiration is acknowledged to be necessary for collections in some cases. Passage of the needle through the spinal cord to underlying bone should be avoided at the cerebellomedullary cistern because it may cause damage to the cord and/or cause blood contamination of the CSF sample.

The likelihood of misinterpretation due to sample deterioration depends on the initial protein concentration of the sample and how long analysis is delayed. For example, if the CSF protein concentration is \u03fe50 mg/dl, a delay in analysis of \u03fd12 hours is unlikely to alter fi nal interpretation. Addition of an equal volume of 4% to 10% neutral buffered formalin or 50% to 90% alcohol is recommended for fi xation of specimens that cannot be immediately delivered to a laboratory and processed immediately (Carmichael, 1998) . Alternatively, the addition of one drop of 10% formalin to 1 to 2 mL of CSF may be used to preserve cells for cell counts and morphologic examination when submitted to a referral laboratory, keeping in mind that cell counts will be affected but may not be clinically signifi cant. Refrigeration will help retard cellular degeneration. Cellular stability can be increased by addition of fresh, frozen, or thawed serum or plasma (Bienzle et al., 2000) or by addition of 20% albumin (Fenner, 2000) . If a CSF sample is not analyzed within 1 hour from collection, Fry and co-workers (2006) recommend to divide the fl uid into 2 aliquots, an unadulterated aliquot for total nucleated cell count and protein measurement and an aliquot added with 20% of fetal calf serum (or 10% autologous serum) for differential cell count and morphologic evaluation. For those samples of insuffi cient volume (\u03fd0.5 mL total), hetastarch (1:1) can be added to CSF for all routine assays. In the last situation, the dilutional effect of adding a stabilizing agent must be taken into account when calculating results. Protein and enzyme concentrations in CSF are relatively stable, and submission to the laboratory by routine delivery, postal delivery, or courier is usually suffi cient for accurate determinations (Carmichael, 1998) .",

The study concluded that high CSF nucleated cell counts and protein concentrations are indicative of neurologic disease, even if samples contain up to 13,200 RBC/\u03bcl.

Refractometer total protein evaluation is not accurate for assessment of CSF since the concentration of protein is quite low compared to serum or plasma and clinically signifi cant changes may not be easily detectable on the refractometer scale. Special analytic techniques most often available at commercial or reference laboratories and not available in practice are needed owing to the minute protein concentration in CSF. Due to the minute amounts present, CSF protein analysis may be referred to as \"microprotein.\" An estimate of CSF protein content can be obtained using urine dipsticks. A membrane microconcentrator technique followed by agarose gel electrophoresis was recently described for measurement of cerebrospinal fl uid proteins in dogs (Gama et al., 2007) . Increased CSF protein concentration may be caused by an alteration in the blood-brain barrier and leakage from plasma or increased local synthesis.

However, changes in CSF glucose concentration in serum or plasma are not immediately refl ected in CSF and may take 1 to 3 hours before they are apparent in CSF (Cook and DeNicola, 1988) . The ratio between blood glucose and CSF glucose is frequently reduced in bacterial infections of the CNS in humans and has been reported to occur in some cases of pyogenic infections of the CNS, CSF hemorrhage, or blood contamination that may result in increased utilization of glucose by cells. However, the relationship between bacterial encephalitis and decreased CSF glucose compared with serum or plasma glucose may depend on multiple factors, including the blood glucose level, degree of permeability of the blood-brain barrier, and presence or absence of glycolytic cells or microorganisms. Fenner (2000) states that the reduction in glucose does not occur in dogs. Signifi cant reductions in CSF glucose concentrations have been reported in human malignant disorders involving the leptomeninges and it is considered a relatively specifi c fi nding for this condition (Chamberlain, 1995) .",

It may be seen with abscesses communicating with the ventricles or subarachnoid space, early viral infections, feline infectious peritonitis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, discospondylitis, acquired hydrocephalus, necrosis, or GME. Marked neutrophilic pleocytosis is most often found with bacterial or fungal meningoencephalitis, neoplasia (Fig. 14-5), steroid-responsive meningitis, or necrotizing vasculitis (Chrisman, 1992) . Demonstration of bacteria, fungi, yeast, or protozoa in CSF can confi rm the presence of these infections. A variety of bacterial types-Cryptococcus, Blastomyces, Histoplasma, Neospora caninum, and ehrlichial organisms-have been demonstrated in CSF (Gaitero et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2005) . Parasites such as Toxocara canis, Dirofi laria immitis, Cuterebra larva, or Cysticercus that may cause neurologic disease have not been reported to be seen in CSF cytology preparations. The presence of marked neutrophilic pleocytosis or increasing numbers of neutrophils in sequential CSF collections has been reported to be an unfavorable prognostic fi nding. Neoplasia should be considered as the most likely diagnosis in a cat more than 7 years of age with progressive clinical neurologic signs of greater than 4 weeks' duration . Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a coronavirus infection, is a common cause of neutrophilic pleocytosis in the cat (Fig. 14-6A&B ). The main neurologic signs are depression, tetraparesis, head tilt, nystagmus, and intention tremor (Baroni and Heinold, 1995) . It accounted for 44% of 61 feline cases of infl ammatory CNS disease . Parent and Rand (1994) indicate that marked neutrophilic pleocytosis with a nucleated count of more than 100 cells/\u03bcl and neutrophils greater than 50% is commonly seen with FIP, along with increased CSF protein (usually greater than 200 mg/dl). They indicate a high probability of FIP if a cat is less than 4 years of age and shows multifocal neurologic signs referable to the cerebellum and/or brainstem, protracted course of illness, and CSF protein greater than 200 mg/dl. Later in the course of the disease, a mixed cellular population may be found with large mononuclear cells and lymphocytes present to a signifi cant degree (Fig. 14-7A&B) . Similar results were found by Singh and others (2005) in a series of 11 cats with FIP. CSF analysis in that study was characterized as suppurative in seven cats, mixed in one, and mononuclear in three. Five cats had marked elevations in the CSF white cells count (\u03fe1000 cells/\u03bcl), three cats had moderate elevations (51 to 1000 calls/ \u03bcl), two cats had mild elevations (6 to 50 cells/\u03bcl), and one cat had insuffi cient sample for a white cells count. Only 11 of 19 cats in one study (Baroni and Heinold, 1995) demonstrated high serum antibody titers, indicating that CSF analysis was essential for a correct diagnosis. Non-FIP viral meningoencephalitis that involved 37% of the infl ammatory cases reported by Rand et al. (1994) was considered most likely with cats less than 3 years of age having progressive neurologic disease and focal neurologic signs referable to the thalamocortex. In these cases, the nucleated cell count was less than 50 cells/\u03bcl and CSF protein was less than 100 mg/dl. Non-FIP viral meningoencephalitis usually carries a favorable prognosis for recovery.",

Bacteria are not observed or cultured and improvement is often seen within 72 hours following glucocorticoid administration; longterm prognosis is good. One report investigated the immunologic response in these cases fi nding IgG and IgA synthesis intrathecally and suggested the humoral response is primary, rather than the result of a generalized immune complex disease (Tipold et al., 1995) . In another more recent paper evaluated clinical fi ndings and prognosis in a series of 12 cases of aseptic suppurative meningitis in juvenile Boxers of which 10 of the dogs exhibited the acute form of the disease and had more than 100 nucleated cells/\u03bcl with neutrophils ranging from 72% to 100%. The two other dogs presented with a more chronic form that produced a mixed pleocytosis, with neutrophils about 60% of total nucleated cells. An abnormal cell count of mixed cell population or mononuclear cells in the CSF are seen in the protracted form, and monitoring of CSF cell count in dogs with this condition seems to be a sensitive indicator of success of treatment (Cizinauskas et al., 2000) .",

Clinical signs of fever, ataxia, tetraparesis, cervical hyperesthesia, and seizures have been reported. Designation of the clinical signs into focal or multifocal was helpful in determining prognosis, with dogs having focal clinical signs surviving longer. Lesions are histologically found in both white and gray matter of the brain and predominantly the white matter of the caudal brainstem and spinal cord. The CSF may have a mild to moderate lymphocytic, mixed cell pleocytosis, or occasionally neutrophilic predominance (Chrisman, 1992) . Nucleated cell counts had a median of 250 cells/\u03bcl (range 0 to 11,840) with the majority having counts greater than 100 cells/\u03bcl (Munana and Luttgen, 1998) . In this same study, dogs with multifocal signs all had pleocytosis, whereas some of the dogs with focal signs had normal cell counts. The predominant cell type was lymphocytic (52%), monocytic (21%), neutrophilic (10%), and mixed cell (17%). CSF protein is variably elevated, with a mean value of 256 mg/dl (range 13 to 1119) as reported by Bailey and Higgins (1986) . Differentiation must be made from infectious diseases and idiopathic necrotizing encephalitis, all of which may appear similar cytologically. Electrophoretic separation of CSF proteins in GME has shown increases in the alpha and beta glo bulin fractions (Sorjonen, 1990) ; however, these fractions are generally decreased in canine distemper (Chrisman, 1992) . Both GME and canine distemper may have increased gamma globulins. GME lesions involve widely disseminated perivascular, lymphocytic-granulomatous meningeal, and parenchymal infi ltrates. Necrosis and demyelination are major features in necrotizing encephalitis and may be present to a minor extent in GME. GME cases with lesions that involve the caudal brainstem or spinal cord progress slowly, permitting longer survival. Radiation has been recommended as an adjunct to treatment, especially in dogs with focal clinical signs. The disease is poorly responsive to glucocorticoids, although an immune-mediated etiology has been suggested (Kipar et al., 1998) . In this study, it was determined that the GME infl ammatory lesions are composed of predominantly CD3 antigen-positive T-lymphocytes and a heterogeneous population of activated macrophages with MHC class II expression suggesting a T-cell-mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity of an organ-specifi c autoimmune disease.",

One report (Abate et al, 1998) indicated that the CSF in distemper cases had an increase in macrophages, an increase in total protein concentration, an increase of the gamma-globulin fraction by electrophoretic separation, and the presence of cellular inclusions. Another report from Amude et al (2006) describes a marked CSF pleocytosis (554 cells/\u03bcl) with protein content within normal limits in a 7-month-old dog with PCRconfi rmed viral distemper. In this case, the nucleated cell differential count was 70% lymphocytes, 25% neutrophils, and 5% monocytes. Diagnosis of canine distemper often involves suggestive history, clinical signs, and evidence of serum or CSF IgM in response to active infection by canine distemper virus.

This will depend on the location of the mass with its proximity to the ventricle, its involvement with the meninges, or its communication with the subarachnoid space in order to have access to the CSF. CSF was collected in 51 dogs with primary intracranial neoplasia in which the fl uid was normal in 10% of cases, characterized by an elevated cell count in 58% of cases, and characterized as albuminocytologic dissociation in 30% of cases. A mixed cell pleocytosis was the most common cytologic abnormality in the 51 samples while cellular atypia or neoplastic cells were detected in only two dogs with CNS lymphoma (Snyder et al., 2006) . The authors concluded that in the case of CNS lymphoma, CSF analysis may be helpful in achieving a diagnosis. However, because of the infl ammatory nature of CSF seen with primary intracranial neoplasia, this test may not be helpful in differentiating between neoplastic and other infl ammatory diseases. Similar results were found in a series of CSF analyses from 28 cats with intracranial neoplasia (Troxel et al., 2003) in that albuminocytologic dissociation was noted in 8 (28.6%) cats. The remaining 20 (71.4%) cats had varied increases in nucleated cell counts while a defi nitive diagnosis of lymphoma was made in only one cat in which lymphoid blast cells were detected in the CSF. Dickinson et al. (2006) tested the hypothesis that predominantly neutrophilic pleocytosis is a typical fi nding in dogs with intracranial meningioma by evaluating the characteristic of cisternal CSF in a series of 56 dogs with confi rmed disease. Results were signifi cantly different from those routinely reported in veterinary literature. Pleocytosis was detected in only 27% of dogs, and pleocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils was detected only in 19% of dogs. They concluded in particular that neutrophilic pleocytosis may not be detected in CSF samples from dogs with meningiomas located within the middle or rostral portion of the cranial fossae.",

Cytology can be an extremely useful tool in distinguishing a true tumor from an infl ammatory or reactive lesion. By using Romanowsky stain, many infectious agents can be easily identifi ed and recognized. In a recent report (Falzone et al., 2008) , a space-occupying lesion in the temporal lobe of an adult cat was diagnosed cytologically as brain toxoplasmosis. The squash prep (Fig. 14-43 ) showed intense reactive gliosis surrounding round, encapsulated tissue cysts ranging from 15 \u03bcm to more than 100 \u03bcm that contained a number of elongated nucleated bradyzoites identifi ed as Toxoplasma sp. While cytologic profi les of smears of various types of human CNS tumors have been extensively described, there are very few reports in the veterinary literature that describe cytologic fi ndings of nervous system lesions and the diagnostic accuracy of this technique.",

Cytologic features suggesting a neuroepithelial origin include highly cellular smears related to the soft texture of the specimen, fi ne fi brillar background, perivascular arrangement with processes approaching the vascular lumen, round nuclei with fi nely stippled chromatin, and endothelial cell proliferation. Cytologic features of nonneuroepithelial lesions can vary considerably due to the extreme heterogeneous morphology of these groups.

            "text": "Non-neuroepithelial tumors that arise from the arachnoid meningeal layer are termed meningiomas. These are the most common intracranial tumor in dogs and cats. The tumors are derived from leptomeningocytes that associate with neural crest tissue and have both epithelial and fi broblastic ultrastructural characteristics. As a result, these tumors have several variant forms that are found both in cervical and lumbar regions of the spinal cord as well as intracranially and within the retrobulbar region (Zimmerman et al., 2000) . Spinal cord meningiomas are mostly extramedullary but few reports note the radiographic presentation of them as intramedullary (Hopkins et al., 1995) . According to Bailey and Higgins (1986) , meningiomas had the highest prevalence of pleocytosis, with a predominance of neutrophils often associated with necrosis. The meningioma was unique of all the tumors reviewed in this study, being the only tumor with CSF nucleated cell counts greater than 50/\u03bcl. Nevertheless in a more recent work (Dickinson et al., 2006) pleocytosis was detected in only 27% of 56 dogs with confi rmed intracranial meningioma, and pleocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils was detected in only 19% of dogs with the conclusion that neutrophilic pleocytosis, especially with total nucleated cells count greater than 50 cells/\u03bcl, was not typical in CSF samples from dogs with intracranial meningiomas. Myelography, MRI, and CT are imaging tools used currently to identify tumors of the brain and spinal cord. Fine-needle aspirations, crush preparations (De Lorenzi et al., 2006; Moissonier et al., 2002) , and incisional cutting needles have been used to obtain cytologic and tissue samples for biopsy. The cytologic features of meningiomas have been discussed in several reports (Zimmerman et al., 2000; Hopkins et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "Neuroepithelial cells also include ependymal cells and choroid plexus cells. The ependymal cells line the ventricular system of the brain and central canal of the spinal cord. The ependymoma is a rare tumor (Fig. 14-55 ) that was reported in the cat with neoplastic cells found in the CSF with a moderately elevated protein content, mild pleocytosis, and macrophages as the predominant cell type along with evidence of chronic hemorrhage. The neoplastic cells were described as large cells having nuclear hyperchromatism, prominent nucleoli, and moderately abundant, highly basophilic agranular cytoplasm appearing singly and in clusters. An anaplastic ependymoma in a dog was diagnosed from partial positive staining with GFAP and vimentin but a negative reaction with S100, CD3, and cytokeratin (Fernandez et al., 1997) . The choroid plexus cells represent a highly vascular portion of the pia mater that projects into the ventricles of the brain and is thought to secrete the CSF. Positive cytokeratin staining is expected in choroid plexus tumors. A cytologic example of a choroid plexus tumor is shown as an imprint of the tumor mass and within the CSF (Fig. 14-56A&B) . The choroid plexus tumors were associated with an increased protein content and increased nucleated cell count in a study (Bailey and Higgins, 1986) . These cells appear similar to mesothelial cells in the CSF, having a large, round nucleus with abundant, well-defi ned, deeply basophilic cytoplasm having surface projections (Fig. 14-56C) . A papillary appearance with epithelial features can be seen in cytologic preparations of choroid plexus papilloma (Fig. 14-56A ). Two choroid plexus carcinomas were cytologically misdiagnosed as choroid plexus papillomas (De Lorenzi et al., 2006) . Both of these tumors occurred within a ventricular site and consisted of large, pedunculated, friable masses that presented cytologically as well-formed papillary structures, usually showing a fi ne fi brovascular core covered by uniform, cuboidal or columnar epithelium having minimal cytologic atypia with moderate pleomorphism (Fig. 14-57A ). The fi nal histologic diagnosis of carcinoma was made based of the presence of single-cell infi ltration into the fi brovascular cores, suggesting that a defi nitive diagnosis of choroid plexus carcinoma can be made only after thorough histologic examination of the resected specimen ( Fig. 14-57B) .",

All of these techniques are currently used in cytologic evaluations of human patients (Bigner, 1997) and to a limited extent in veterinary medicine (De Lorenzi et al., 2006; Moissoinier et al., 2002; Vernau et al., 2001) . There may be increased demand and/or need for development of special preparative techniques such as cell blocks and immunocytochemistry for more precise identifi cation of primary or metastatic tumors, infl ammatory cell types, or immunophenotype of malignant or nonmalignant lymphoid proliferations. This has occurred in human medicine for the purpose of diagnosis, prognosis, and disease monitoring. A recent study (Tilgner et al., 2005) retrospectively analyzed 5000 consecutive stereotactic brain biopsy smear preparations from 4589 patients. In this huge series of cases the intraoperative, cytologic diagnosis was correct in 90.3% of cases. The authors conclude that intraoperative diagnosis with stereotactic biopsy has high validity and that immediate treatment based on smear preparations can be justifi ed. Although in a much smaller series of cases, similar results have been published in veterinary literature as well, with a satisfactory cytologic diagnosis obtained in more than 90% of examined cases (De Lorenzi et al., 2006) .",
