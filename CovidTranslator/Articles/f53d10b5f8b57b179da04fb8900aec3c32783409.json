The enzyme, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is absolutely required for replication of the RNA genome and it is henceforth called \"RNA replicase'. However, it also functions as \"RNA transcriptase\" to produce mRNA for gene expression. Biochemical characterization of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase was initiated more than 30 years ago soon after the discovery of RNA phages. In spite of numerous efforts, the purification of RNA polymerase has been successful only for a limited number of bacterial, animal and plant viruses. Difficulty in molecular analysis arose from the low level of viral RNA polymerase production, their low extractability, the instability of enzyme activity, and the complexity of enzyme structure and functions.",

The availability of many RNA polymerase sequences led to recognition of several conserved motifs among the RNA polymerases from different groups of RNA viruses. For instance, a unique three-amino-acid sequence, GDD, is now recognized as a hallmark of viral RNA polymerases. Further, viral RNA polymerases can now be over-produced from cDNA clones, for in vitro analysis of their structure and functions. In addition, the establishment of transfection systems of cDNA and cDNA-directed transcripts provided a new tool for testing in vivo functions. The role of each conserved motif in RNA polymerase molecules can now be examined by a combination of localized mutagenesis of cDNA, in vitro assays using over-produced proteins, and in vivo transfection assays.",

Among the amino acid sequences of the RNA polymerase from MS2 (group I), GA (group II), Q~ (group III) and SP (group IV), there is a great deal of conservation throughout the central region, which suggests the terminal regions are more tolerant to small changes in amino acid sequences than are the internal regions. The consensus YGDD sequence, common to all these RNA phages, also exists in most other viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases [42] . The pioneering study by Inokuchi and Hirashima [35] showed that amino acid substitutions within this sequence specifically impaired the functions of Q~ polymerase. They also proposed that this motif is involved in the binding o f Z n 2 +, an essential cofactor of all the enzymes involved in nucleic acid synthesis. Recombination of phage RNA takes place by a copy choice mechanism during RNA replication [61] . It is a source of self-replicative variant R N A 238 A. Ishihama and P. Barbier species and of new vRNA-associated sequences such as parts of tRNA [7, 57] . Such variant or unrelated RNA sequences may arise as a result of template switching by the viral RNA polymerase or by the RNA polymerase jumping between templates [37] .",

A viral RNA polymerase with similar functional specicities has also been isolated from the cytoplasm of polio virus-infected cells. Product RNAs in these reactions are covalently linked to the primers added. The primer requirement can be replaced by a host factor with RNA uridylation activity (or terminal uridyltransferase; TUTase). In this case, newly synthesized oligo(U) is covalently linked to the vRNA-poly(A) tail and hybridizes with the poly(A) sequence through a snap-back mechanism, allowing the oligo(U) to serve as a primer for elongation of cRNA chains. As a result the RNA products are twice the size of the template vRNA. The cap structures commonly found in eukaryotic mRNA are absent from the 5' terminus of poliovirus RNA, but instead a small virus-coded protein, VPg, 22 amino acid residues in length, is covalently attached to the vRNA 5' terminus. After infection, VPg is removed from vRNA prior to translation. VPg is attached not only to the vRNA but also to the cRNA. Thus, the VPg may have a signalling function for initiation of RNA synthesis.",

The expression of the viral genes takes place through transcription of cRNA into gene-specific subgenomic mRNAs. All mRNA species carry a common sequence at the 5' terminus. This 5' coterminal structure is a transcript of the cRNA 3' terminal region. The RNA polymerase genes of two coronaviruses sequenced so far, avian coronavirus IBV (infectious bronchitis virus) and murine coronavirus (MCV) MH-A59, consists of two ORFs of about 12 (ORFla) and 8 (ORFlb) kb in length, encoded in the 5'-proximal region of vRNA [10, 11] . The complete RNA polymerase is formed by a translation frameshift from the 3' end of ORFla to the 5' end of ORFlb (Fig. 2 ). This process involves specific RNA sequence elements at the ORFla/ORFlb boundary, including an RNA pseudoknot, and efficient ribosome frameshifting takes place even in an in vitro translation'system [12] . This unusual expression strategy of the coronavirus RNA polymerase gene may be related to the generation of a mosaic molecule, with a picornavirus-like N-terminal region and alphavirus-like C-terminal region [45] . The complete translation product of 250 kDa is, however, subsequently cleaved again to yield 28-and 220-kDa functional proteins [5] .",

A cellular protein of 50 kDa copurifies along the CMV RNA polymerase [30] and loss of this 50 kDa host factor always correlates with loss of the CMV RNA polymerase activity. The 3' regions of some plant virus RNAs can be folded to form tRNA-like structures which can be aminoacylated by cellular enzymes, and thus any host protein interacting with aminoacyl-tRNA may also bind to aminoacylable viral RNAs. In fact, an affinity-purified 41 kDa protein on BMV 2a protein-column, with stimulation activity of the BMV RNA polymerase, was recently identified as translation elongation factor eIF3 [68] . The successful propagation of a BMV-derived replicon, established in the yeast S. cerevisiae by expressing the BMV RNA polymerase proteins [40] , indicates that any host factor necessary for viral RNA replication must be conserved in evolution. On the other hand, the similarity of the cis-acting sequence at the 5' termini of BMV RNAs with the internal control region of tRNAs raises the possibility that a host RNA polymerase III transcription factor could be the trans-acting factor binding this BMV sequence [49] .",

The 110 kDa protein produced using a baculovirus expression system is, however, inactive in RNA synthesis [83] . In virus-infected cells, the 110 kDa RNA polymerase is further processed into the 87 kDa form. At present, it is not known which is the functional form for transcription and replication. As in the case of animal picornaviruses, the replication complexes are tightly associated with the infected cell membranes and the synthesis of VPg-linked RNA is coupled with the polyprotein processing [85] . According to the picornavirus model, a host factor such as uridyltransferase would also be necessary for formation of primers for RNA synthesis.",

During phage maturation, the genome RNA segments are packaged into preformed empty particles (or procapsids) consisting of four early viral proteins, P1, P2, P4 and P7. The RNA-filled procapsids, which have RNA polymerase activity, are then coated with a shell of the viral protein PS, to form the nucleocapsids, and concomitantly the RNA polymerase activity is shut off. Uncoating of the nucleocapsids is an essential step in the initial stage of phage infection for the expression of the virion-associated polymerase activity [59] . Transcription of ~6 dsRNA resembles DNA replication, as being semiconservative and in sharp contrast to the conservative transcription mode of reo-and rotaviral double-strand RNA (see below). Protein P2 has some sequence similarity to other viral RNA polymerases. It is present in about 10 to 20 molecules per virion, thus 3 to 7 molecules for each RNA segment. This protein is necessary not only for RNA synthesis but also for packaging of the genome RNA. One possible explanation is that P2 forms complexes with newly synthesized plus-strand copies as an assembly core, to which other capsid proteins associate to form nucleocapsid cores [27] . The synthesis of minus-strand copies may then take place, forming dsRNA, prior to association of the P8 shell. In any case, the P2 protein has dual functions as the catalytic unit for RNA polymerization and the nucleation core for virus assembly.",

Transcription of the double-strand RNAs is catalyzed by a virion-associated RNA polymerase, expressing its intrinsic enzyme activity only after infection [37] . At early stages of infection, transcription is asymmetric, i.e., only plusstrand RNA is synthesized, and conservative, i.e., the newly synthesized RNA is released without strand separation of the template duplex.

The virus infection cycle involves a balance between the two functions of the RNA polymerase, transcription and replication. Several different mechanisms have been proposed for the switching of RNA polymerase from transcription to replication [37] . The N protein is needed for vRNA to function as the template for RNA synthesis; in addition, excess N associates with nascent RNA products and the formation of N-RNA complexes prevents transcription attenuation, allowing to produce the genome-size read-through cRNA. The NS protein also plays a role in the switching control, because the NS protein interacts not only with L but also with NP. NS is an exceptional protein as to the extent of its pi~osphorylation: there are, in all, 33 potential sites of phosphorylation, 12 threonine and 21 serine residues, which mostly reside in the N-terminal proximal region. The L-NS interaction is controlled by the level of NS phosphorylation. A heavily phosphorylated and extremely acidic N-terminal domain constitutes a novel structure that resembles the phosphate backbone of RNA, to which NP binds tightly. The formation of NS-NP complexes prevents self-aggregation of free NP. Furthermore, NS displaces RNA-bound NP in a localized manner, thereby allowing the RNA polymerase to gain access to the template RNA.",

In the early stages of virus infection, two types of vRNA copy are produced: mRNA with a 5'-cap and 3'-poly(A) tail and full-length cRNA without cap structure and poly(A) tail. At late stages, however, progeny vRNA is synthesized by copying cRNA. The growth of influenza virus is unique because continued synthesis of host cell nuclear RNA is required for viral transcription to occur, as RNA molecules synthesized by RNA polymerase II are used as primers for primary transcription of influenza virus [37] . The first step in capped RNAprimed transcription is the cleavage of existing capped RNA by a \"capped RNA endonuclease\" associated with influenza viral RNA polymerase. Viral RNA polymerase recognizes the cap-t structure at the RNA 5'-end, measures a distance of 10-11 nucleotides from the cap structure, and cleaves next to purine bases or prior to either A or U residues. Transcription of viral genome RNAs is initiated using the resulting capped oligonucleotides as primers. This unusual \"cap snatching mechanism\" of transcription is employed by other enveloped segmented minus-strand RNA viruses and ambisense RNA viruses such as bunyaviruses and arenaviruses. Besides its priming function for viral transcription, the cap-t structure acts as an allosteric effector for activation of virionassociated RNA polymerase.",

In many cases, the GDD motif is preceded by Tyr and is located within a hydrophobic amino acid stretch. Sequences surrounding the (Y)GDD motif show some similarity among each group of viruses sharing the same replication strategy. As might be expected from the difference in replication strategies, RNA polymerases from plus-and minus-strand viruses differ in their sequences even in the most conserved GDD motif; the consensus sequence is SDD for segmented minus-strand viruses, and GDN(Q) for unsegmented minus-strand viruses [64] . In contrast, double-strand viruses carry conserved sequences rather similar to those of plus-strand viruses [13, 45] . In the case of RNA-dependent DNA polymerases (or reverse transcriptases), this motif is modified to (Y)MDD.",

Inokuchi et al. (unpubl.) postulated that this motif is involved in metal ion binding at the catalytic site of the enzyme. As demonstrated for phage Q~ and poliovirus RNA polymerases, mutations in this motif result in significant toss of enzymatic activity [35, 38, 39] . However, some viral RNA polymerases carry different amino acid residues at one or two positions within this motif sequence: the Tyr residue in (Y)GDD motif is strictly conserved in picornavirus-like RNA polymerases, but is variable in alphaviruslike RNA polymerases. Substitution of Met for the Tyr residue in the poliovirus (Y)GDD motif results in a loss-of-function mutation, which can be suppressed by an intramolecular secondary mutation [38] . In this position, Cys is found in black beetle virus (BBV) and TMV; Ile is found in SND and Middleburg virus (MDV); Met is found in southern bean mosaic virus (SBMV); and Ser is found in yellow fever virus (YFV), BMV and AMV [4, 65] . In these cases, amino acid changes in the motif may be suppressed by secondary mutations elsewhere within the same molecule.",

Quantitative estimation indicates that the error frequency of poliovirus (POL) and vesicular stomatitis (VSV) RNA polymerase ranges from 10 _3 to 10 -4 both in vitro and in vivo. The rapid fixation of mutations in RNA viruses implies, for instance, that the similarity observed between viruses which infect insect vectors and either animal or plant hosts indicates that their divergence took place recently. It can be best explained if all of the viruses in these groups originally infected insect cells and subsequently evolved to infect either plants or animals. Supporting this prediction, plant arboviruses such as plant bunya-and tenuiviruses share regions of sequence similarity with insect-transmitted animal bunyaviruses, arguing for a common origin E20, 82].",
