The Senior Leadership Seminar was held in June 21, 2013, to discuss opinions of multiple ministries and agencies as well as areas of improvement among high-ranking officials from the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the United States of America (USA). This exercise was cohosted by the Korean Ministry of National Defense and the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare and by their counterpart in the United States (U.S.), the U.S. Department of Defense, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The exercise directors are Director of Centers for Infectious Disease Control and Prevention in the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Director of Armaments Verification in the Ministry of National Defense. Furthermore, 10 related ministries and agencies participated, including the President's Office, National Intelligence Service, National Police Agency, and National Environmental Management Agency. The AR13's scenario is composed of a series of bioattacks in Seoul, Korea, and the ministries and agencies of both countries collaborate with each other in responding to the attack [6].",
