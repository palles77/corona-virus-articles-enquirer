            "text": "Undergraduate training is adapting, with special study modules and intercalated Bachelor of Science degrees in international or global health having been available for more than a decade. 5 The updated General Medical Council guidelines for undergraduate medical training 'Tomorrow's Doctors' include the learning outcome: 'Discuss from a global perspective the determinants of health and disease and variations in health-care delivery and medical practice' 6 and global health learning outcomes for all UK medical students have recently been developed. 7, 8 This is welcome progress but, without a similar shift in postgraduate training, is not sufficient. Indeed Martineau et al.'s analysis of the career paths of early graduates of intercalated international health BScs concludes that 'the successful establishment of global health education at an undergraduate level must now be replicated in postgraduate training to follow this generation as they progress'. 9 There is high-level recognition of the need for and benefits of the NHS adopting a global health approach, 10,13 including a House of Lords debate led by Lord Crisp. 14 Several Royal Colleges have responded with conferences, 15 -17 position statements 18 or strategies. 19, 20 Despite this, the coverage of global health within UK postgraduate medical curricula has not been systematically assessed. This article presents a review of the current global health content of a cross-section of postgraduate medical curricula in the UK. The global health content of the curricula described in Table 1 was established by examining the competencies within them. For several curricula this was done by more than one person and discussed to achieve consensus. The competencies were coded as 'UK' (statement only relevant to UK work, often referring to UK institutions or structures), 'global' (statement with an explicit reference to aspects of health outside the UK such as the global burden of disease or organizations involved in international health-care issues) or generic (relevant both to the UK and international settings). This built on work previously conducted and published on the Faculty of Public Health's (FPH) curriculum; the results presented here for the FPH curriculum are from this previous work. 22 ",

These were very similar to the global health competencies in the CEM and RCP-GIM. Table 3 compares Collegiate competencies with the proposed undergraduate global health competencies. 7 From Table 3 we can see that The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) was the only College to require all trainees to 'be aware of (understand the work of ) the World Health Organization (WHO)', or 'know the local, national and international structures for health care'. These cross-cutting competencies have applicability to all specialties. Table 3 also demonstrates that there are a number of global health topics that are not covered by any of the postgraduate curricula such as health inequalities or the mobility of and inequalities in the global health workforce. The latter is of importance not only because of concerns around staffing health facilities in lowand middle-income countries but also because many of those undertaking postgraduate training in the UK will have qualified elsewhere, and large numbers of UK doctors work overseas at some time raising issues about the regulation and registration of physicians.",

There was brief reference in The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) curriculum to EU law, international conventions, international patient or professional organizations and to the prevalence of conditions in the UK in comparison to other European countries, however having knowledge of these was not an explicit learning outcome. Achievement of some competencies, such as RCPCH's awareness 'of child health exploitation issues including child prostitution, child labour and children in combat \u2026 and the effects of armed conflict on child health' or The Royal College of Pathologists' (RCPath's) 'impact on health of armed conflict, natural disasters and other social upheavals', would clearly benefit from a global perspective or international experience.

This facilitated a shared understanding of what was meant by a global health competency and arguably helped with consistency across curriculum reviews. However, reviewers without a global health interest may have reached different conclusions. Secondly, the process of assignation of a competency to a category, though guided by the agreed definitions, is ultimately a subjective decision. While in some cases several people reviewed curricula, and in the FPH curriculum review good inter-rater reliability was achieved, 22 this was not possible for all curricula. To reduce inconsistency all assignations to the global health category were reviewed by JH and discussed with reviewers. As demonstrated in Table 3 , the global health competencies identified were very similar across the curricula indicating that this process was fairly successful. Finally, there were some discrepancies between the curricula in terms of exactly what 'a competency' was. Pragmatic decisions were taken where necessary and for this reason there are a number of caveats to the total number of competencies presented for each curriculum. These decisions were taken to increase the comparability of results between the curricula.",

This can be achieved through a small number of common core competencies in global health, easily realizable without overseas experience, which are consistent across core curricula. These could cover issues such as the global burden of disease, global determinants of health, the role of international organizations in health, sustainable development and the potential structures of health-care systems. These competencies do not need to be developed from scratch; those already introduced by Colleges and described in Table 3 can be used as a starting point. Such competencies can be framed to naturally follow on from those being introduced into undergraduate medical training. 7 With common core competencies in place, Colleges can develop additional competencies relevant to their specialty at their own discretion. Levels of knowledge and understanding of global health issues will fit with standard levels of competence in curricula, though ensuring that they are covered by appropriate assessments will require a specific mandate from Colleges.",
