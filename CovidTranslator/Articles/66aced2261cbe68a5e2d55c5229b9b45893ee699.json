Microbiol., A procedure was developed to purify infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) by gel chromatography (GC) with a Sephacryl S-1000 column. Virus samples concentrated by centrifugation were applied to a Sephacryl S-1000 column and eluted by 0.02 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2 ) containing 0.15 M NaC1. Virus particles were recovered mainly in the first peak. Purity of the samples was evaluated by both sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electron microscopy. Using electron microscopy, it was found that there were more spike-rich particles in the virus samples purified by GC than in those purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (SDGC). In addition, the hemagglutination unit [logzo (infectivity titer/hemagglutination titer ) ] of GCpurified virus samples was ~ 10 times lower than that of SDGC-purified virus samples. These results indicate that Sephacryl S-1000 gel chromatography is useful for purification of IBV.",

The IBV virion with a diameter of ~ 120 nm is enveloped and contains one molecule of an infectious (plus-sense), single-stranded RNA (Robb and Bond, 1979; Shiddell et al., 1982 ) . The virion is mainly composed of spike (S; peplomer) with a molecular weight of 128 kDa, membrane (M) with a molecular weight of 45 kDa and nucleocapsid (N) with a molecular weight of 25 kDa (Spaan et al., 1988) . S and M proteins are both glycosylated and parts of them are exposed at the surface of the virion. S protein consists of two glycoproteins, S1 and $2 (Cavanagh, 1981 (Cavanagh, , 1983 . The S protein of IBV may play an important role in viral activities, such as hemagglutination (HA), infectivity for cultured cells, and antigenicity recognized by neutralizing antibody . Therefore, it is necessary to obtain spike-rich virus preparations for some studies of IBV.",

However, in some vaccine strains of IBV spike projections were easily released from virions during SDGC (Yagyu and Ohta, 1985) . In addition, reported that S1 (GP90) was either degraded or released from extracellular virions by incubation of culture medium containing IBV (Strain B42 ) without cells overnight at 37 \u00b0 C, and they concluded that binding of S1 and $2 to virion was very weak. Therefore, purification by SDGC might cause dissociation of spike projections from the virion. An aim of the present study was to apply gel chromatography using a Sephacryl S-1000 column to purify some IBV strains in order to obtain intact purified virus samples from allantoic fluids.",

The result indicates that GC-purified virus samples possess more hemagglutinin on each virion. In addition, spike retention rate in electron microscopy of the GC-purified virus samples of Strain M41 was much higher than that of SDGC-purified virus samples. Furthermore, although a marked difference in hemagglutinating activity was observed between GC-purified and SDGC-purified virus samples, there was no difference to infectivity (Table 1 ). This result demonstrates that the polypeptide associated with HA is not directly involved in infectivity. Therefore, it seems that diminution of hemagglutinating activity in SDGC-purified virus samples did not result from steric hindrance of spike projections, but from decrease of the number of parts of those on the virions. Recently, reported that virions lacking S1 were no longer infectious to chick kid-ney cells nor able to cause HA, whether or not they contained $2. However, such virions did retain the ability to attach to erythrocytes and cells. In contrast, both GC-purified and SDGC-purified virus samples showed infectivity to both embryonated chicken eggs (Tables 1 and 2 ) and chick kidney cells (data not shown). These results suggest that SDGC-purified virus samples retain a reduced amount of S1 on the surface of the virions, which is consistent with the result of SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 ) . Thus, it seems probable that we could obtain more spike-rich virions with high HA activity by GC purification than by SDGC.",
