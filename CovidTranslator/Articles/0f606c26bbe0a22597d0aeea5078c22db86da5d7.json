However, CRCoV infection is thought to cause only subclinical or asymptomatic conditions (Erles et al., 2003) . CRCoV replication in the respiratory epithelium may damage the mucociliar system, and thereby lead to a more severe clinical course of infection than other respiratory pathogens .",

The three CRCoV-positive samples were found to be competent for viral propagation and isolation, using human rectal tumor cells , and the structure and nonstructure proteins encoded in the 3 0 -end of the CRCoV genome were sequenced. The small open reading frames situated between the spike and envelope genes of the three Korean CRCoV isolates were found to encode three nonstructural proteins (4.9 kDa, 2.7 kDa, and 12.8 kDa in size), as were the British (CRCoV G9142) and Italian (CRCoV 240-05) strains. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the spike protein in the CRCoV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) strains revealed twenty sequence variations. The predicted spike protein of CRCoV contained 20 or 21 N-glycosylation sites, whereas that of BCoV contained 19 sites. Phylogenetic analysis of the spike gene from eight CRCoV and six BCoV strains, performed using the neighbor-joining approach, allowed us to classify into two clades (CRCoV and BCoV) and three Korean strains (CRCoV-K9, -K37, and -K39) related to the Japanese strain 06/075. \u00df 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.",

Interestingly, British CRCoV strains T4182, T0715, T1030, and T1207 were found to encode two corresponding nonstructural proteins, but strain G9142 was shown to encode three putative nonstructural proteins (4.9 kDa, 2.7 kDa, and 12.7 kDa) (Erles et al., 2007) . Sequence analysis of the viral RNA 3 0 -end of an Italian CRCoV, strain 240-05, also identified the genomic region between the spike and the envelope protein genes, as it did for strain G9142 (Lorusso et al., 2009) . In this study, we identified the sequence encoding the structural and nonstructural proteins in the 3 0 -end of the CRCoV genome, performed a molecular phylogenetic analysis, using the neighbor-joining approach, of the CRCoV spike gene isolated from mixed tissue samples (lung and trachea) of dogs from Korea, and conducted research to identify the number of the nonstructural proteins encoded by the region between the spike and envelope genes.",

Three proteins (4.9 kDa, 4.8 kDa, and 12.8 kDa) were found to be encoded by the region between the spike and envelope genes, while the corresponding gene region in CRCoV-4182 encodes only two proteins (8.8 kDa and 12.8 kDa) (Erles et al., 2007) . It was recently reported that CRCoV strain 240-05 isolated from Italy encodes proteins of 4.9 kDa, 2.7 kDa, and 12.8 kDa (Lorusso et al., 2009 ). The 4.9-12.8 kDa proteins encoded by three Korean strains were consistent with those of CRCoV strain G9142 and 240-05. The CRCoV-4182 strain isolated from the UK is likely to have undergone genetic mutation. Therefore, it is likely that the proteins encoded by the region between the spike and envelope genes in the CRCoV genome are three nonstructural proteins that are 4.9 kDa, 2.7 kDa, and 12.8 kDa. Coronavirus genes are preceded at the 5 0 -end by TRSs that commonly include the consensus sequence CYAAAC (Hofmann et al., 1993; Zuniga et al., 2004) . In the genetic characterization of the bubaline coronavirus (BuCoV), the predicted nucleotide sequence of TRS encoding the 12.8 kDa protein were shown to be different for BCoV and CRCoV, which were CCAAAC and CUAAAC, respectively.",
