            "text": "Incidents of diarrhea virus have been consistently reported after the turn of the century. In 2009, outbreaks of PED were reported in most areas of Southern Vietnam [11] with the infected piglets developing severe dehydration and dying within a week. In 2010, variant-induced diarrhea broke out in China resulting in the death of 1 million piglets over 10 provinces of Southern China, with a mortality rate ranging from 80% to 100% in piglets aged younger than seven days [12] . In 2012, it was reported that the detection rate of PEDV in 12 southern provinces of china was 61.11%. In addition, a variant strain was determined using sequencing and was characterized by the presence of 9 additional Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a causative agent of porcine intestinal disease, which causes vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration in piglets. PEDV is associated with the most severe pathogenesis in one-weekold piglets, with mortality rates reaching 100%. A PEDV strain was isolated from the intestinal tract of diarrheic piglets from a pig farm in Jiangsu Province in March 2016, termed the JS201603 isolate. The isolated virus was confirmed to be PEDV via RT-PCR, electron microscopy, a cytopathic effect assay and sequence analysis. The S and ORF3 genes of the JS201603 isolate were sequenced, revealing that the S gene was associated with a 15-base insertion at 167 nt, 176 -186 nt, and 427 -429 nt, as well as a sixbase deletion in 487 -492 nt, indicating that it was a current epidemic variant compared with the classical strain, CV777. No deletion occurred between 245 -293 nt of the ORF3 gene in the JS201603 isolate compared with the vaccine isolates YY2013 and SQ2014. An experimental infection model indicated that the piglets in the challenge group successively developed diarrhea, exhibiting yellow-colored loose stools with a foul odor. The piglets in the JS201603 isolate challenge group displayed reduced food consumption, lost 1 3 bp in the S gene, when compared to CV777, including an insertion of 15 bp and a deletion of 6 bp [13] . Since 2013, there have been outbreaks of PEDV in 14 American states, with mortality rates as high as 95% [14] . In March 2016, an outbreak of diarrhea in a large pig farm in Jiangsu province, China was reported, which had a severe impact on suckling piglets. The newborn piglets developed severe watery diarrhea and vomiting within 24 h of birth, with mortality rates as high as 90%, resulting in substantial losses to the pig farm. A strain of PEDV was isolated and identified from the diarrhea samples obtained at this pig farm. In addition, gene sequencing and pathogenicity experiments were performed, with the aim of establishing a foundation for future studies of PEDV vaccines.",

The reaction was performed using an automated thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, USA) under the following cycling conditions: 1 cycle at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min; 34 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 45s, 56 \u00b0C for 45 s, and 72 \u00b0C for 1 min; 1 cycle at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. The product fragments ranged from 620 bp to 1634 bp. The PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. The negative control for the PCR reactions was the PCR reaction mixture containing DMEM instead of the template DNA. Sequence assembly was carried out based on the sequencing results; moreover, sequence alignments of the S and ORF3 genes were also performed using the distance-based neighborjoining method of MEGA 5.2 software.",

The piglets were divided randomly into two groups, each containing four animals.

At the end of the study, all surviving piglets were euthanized humanely according to the instructions of Sinovet (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. At necropsy, different organ samples including intestine and stomach were fixed in 10% buffered neutral formalin for hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E).

Sequence analysis of the S and ORF3 genes demonstrated that the JS201603 isolate was a variant strain. Homology analysis revealed that the JS201603 isolate shared greater homology with subgroup II than with subgroup I. Furthermore, there was no deletion of 49 nt bases in the ORF3 gene and the JS201603 isolate exhibited low homology with the vaccine strain. The results obtained using an experimental infection model suggested that the isolate could induce distinct clinical symptoms in piglets. The intestine samples were collected from a pig farm where the pigs had been previously immunized with the PEDV CV777 attenuated vaccine in August 2015 and the PEDV-TGEV live attenuated vaccine in February 2016; however, further investigation as to whether the isolate strain was derived from the recombination of vaccine strains is still required. It could be determined that the existing CV777 vaccine strain on the market exhibited lower protective efficacy against the occurrence of diarrhea. This data is consistent with the 2013 report which stated that pig farms immunized with the CV777 inactivated vaccine experienced PEDV outbreaks [19] .",
