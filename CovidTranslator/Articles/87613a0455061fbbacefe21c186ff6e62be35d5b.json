The important details in these optimization experiments included simultaneous incubation of the specimen with biotinylated monoclonal detector antibody in microtiter wells coated with catching antibody. Apparently, the liquid phase antigen-antibody reaction and immediate binding of the complexes on the solid phase catching antibody is more efficient than step-wise reaction (first, the antigen on catching antibody on solid phase and then, after washing, the binding of the biotinylated detector antibody on the antigen). Additional improvements of the test were obtained by overnight incubation of detector antibody with specimen, and by using the TR-FIA diluent containing 20 ~tM N'-diethylene triaminepentaacetic acid. The effect of this chelating agent on an EIA test is not clear, but it should be evaluated in other antigen/antibody EIA systems.",

Overnight incubation was not extensively compared with the customary 1 h incubation at 37 C' C with clinical specimens, but did improve the sensitivity of the tests. With semipurified control antigens, the overnight incubation was significantly better. The use of the overnight format and the higher concentration of the biotinylated monoclonals in biotin-EIA could explain the 9 'false negative' results we had in TR-FIA. As regards the 54 negative specimens that we found using both methods, we suppose they could be due to the fact that, especially in the cases of influenza B and parainfluenza specimens, all the aspirates were stored for more than 2 years at -2OC and were frozen and thawed many times before we tested them, so the viral proteins, particularly the nucleoproteins, may have been denaturated.",

The answer depends on the location of the laboratory, the number of specimens tested daily, the availability of reagents, and the previous expertise of the laboratory. Solid phase immunoassays have two definite advantages. One is the possibility for bulk testing, because a technician can test up to 40 specimens per day for seven respiratory viruses with TR-FIA and it takes only minutes for a virologist to read the test. Another advantage is the stability of the specimens for Biotin-EIA or TR-FIA, since no intact cells are required in the specimens and the viral proteins in the virion or in soluble form are relatively stable, at least if they are not frozen and thawed several times; thus, if necessary, the specimens can be sent to the laboratory without cooling, even by mail.
