            "text": "In the past few years, the United States of America has experienced an increase in the number of disasters that have occurred and a higher morbidity, mortality, and cost associated with these events. In 2005 alone, 5 disasters (4 hurricanes and a drought in the Midwest) resulted in $105 billion in damages, 1 required over 200,000 displaced individuals to be housed in community shelters, 2 and caused 1451 deaths, almost 4 times the national average of deaths related to natural disasters in the United States. 3 Most natural disasters do not result in large outbreaks of infectious diseases, 4 but all disasters can create conditions that increase the risk of disease transmission. 5 For example, past natural disasters have been associated with skin, gastrointestinal/diarrheal, and upper respiratory infections. 2, 4 One community shelter during Hurricane Katrina suffered from an outbreak of norovirus. 2 Infectious disease disasters, such as a bioterrorism attack, outbreak of an emerging infectious disease, or pandemic, have the greatest potential for causing infection related morbidity and mortality. Health Canada estimated that the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) resulted in a net cost to their national economy to be between $1.5 billion and $2.1 billion and 916 deaths. 6, 7 The potential economic impact of a bioterrorism attack could range from $477.7 million per 100,000 persons exposed (for a an attack using brucellosis) to $26.2 billion per 100,000 persons exposed (if anthrax is used as the bioterrorism agent). 8 Of all disasters, pandemics pose the largest risk of having infectious disease implications. It has been estimated that an influenza pandemic could cost between $71 and $166 billion and result in 89,000 to 207,000 deaths in the United States. 9 It is essential that the infection prevention profession be involved in emergency management to help mitigate the infectious disease implications of disasters. The purposes of this article are to provide an overview of the historical role of the infection prevention profession in emergency management and describe the proceedings from an Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc (APIC)-sponsored Mini-Summit on Emergency Management conducted in May 2008.",

An APIC Task Force for Bioterrorism Preparedness was created in 1999 to address infection prevention issues related to a biologic attack. Soon after, the Task Force was renamed to the APIC Task Force for Bioterrorism and Emerging Infectious Diseases Preparedness, and its mission was expanded to address emerging infections, such as SARS and avian influenza. In 2005, the APIC Bioterrorism and Emerging Infectious Diseases Preparedness Task Force became an official APIC committee. At this time, the focus of the group expanded once more to include an all-hazards approach, which is in line with standard emergency management principles. The APIC Emergency Preparedness Committee now focuses on creating educational and reference materials related to preventing infection transmission for all types of disasters.",

The APIC's strategic goal No. 5 in its Vision 2012 document states that ''APIC will play a leadership role in emergency preparedness related to infection prevention and control, including emerging and reemerging diseases, bioterrorism, natural disasters, and other issues.'' This process began by making an official APIC Emergency Preparedness Committee. Examples of other APIC initiatives include conducting a needs assessment to identify educational and planning products desired by APIC members, 5 working with Trust for America's Health to assess US hospital disaster preparedness in 2005 and 2007, 12,13 expanding the emergency preparedness component of the APIC Web site, and developing health policy and guidelines related to infection prevention during disasters. 14, 15 In addition, numerous educational products and programs have been created in relation to infection prevention in emergency management. In late 2007, APIC Headquarters identified the need to define further the role of the infection prevention profession in emergency management, especially as it relates to the role the APIC as an organization will play in this arena. A Mini-Summit on Emergency Preparedness was planned for early 2008.",

In addition, targeted questions were posed to individual organizational representatives to determine their unique perspective on emergency management and how the APIC might work with them. For instance, representatives from the Department of Homeland Security were asked how the APIC might aid their agency in emergency management activities. Discussion topics included the current status and role of infection prevention professionals in emergency management, challenges and gaps in disaster preparedness, communication needs, and the APIC strengths and opportunities in emergency management.

In essence, the participants thought that there are still a lot of gaps in emergency management that may have infectious disease implications. The most frequently cited concern was the lack of education and compliance with basic infection prevention practice across all disciplines of health care workers, response agency employees, and the general public. Participants stressed that nonhospital-based workers, such as first responders, home health employees, and public health professionals, are most lacking in infection prevention education. It was also mentioned that many nonhospital-based workers lack access to existing communication methods for transmitting infection prevention information, such as the Health Alert Network, which puts them at an even greater disadvantage during a disaster when trying to gain information about preventing disease spread. There was also a concern expressed by the Mini-Summit participants about the lack of expertise about emergency management principles among IPs. If IPs are not familiar with emergency management and understand their role in this process, it will be very difficult for them to provide guidance to noninfection prevention professionals who will look to the IP for advice. Educating IPs on emergency management needs to be a top priority.",

The major barriers to implementing effective infection prevention in emergency management is a lack of IP time to engage in these activities; no discernable solution to the increasing need for IPs and demands on their time; lack of infection prevention content provided in nursing, medicine, or public health curricula making for an unprepared workforce; and The participants thought that the primary roles of IPs in emergency management are to serve as educators and consultants on all issues related to infection prevention. This includes consulting with facility and community disaster planning teams and providing emergency management education related to infection prevention for all disaster response agencies/groups and the general public. Examples of response agency groups with which IPs will need to work include traditional first responders (fire, emergency medical service, and law enforcement professionals), federal agency employees, health care workers, public health professionals, and volunteer agencies staff (Red Cross, Medical Reserve Corp, and others).

Other strengths of APIC include an expertise in infection prevention; a large membership, strong local, state, and federal networks; a consistent approach to using evidence-based information to generate accurate and practical guidance; and the ability to deliver education in a variety of formats. The APIC has 114 chapters, all with local organizations, networks, and community-based relationships. This infrastructure enables the APIC to communicate rapidly and effectively to its members, chapters, stakeholders, and response agency partners. Through this communication network, the APIC has been able to disseminate vital information related to emergency management. An example of this was distribution of infection prevention information that was sent to affected areas during Hurricane Katrina.",

One area of focus for the APIC needs to be raising awareness of the IP's role in emergency management at the local and regional level.

APIC Headquarters should take a lead in raising awareness about the need to involve IPs in emergency management at health care facilities and in the community. Participants emphasized that one of the APIC's primary roles in emergency management should involve developing and providing education regarding the infection control implications of disasters and appropriate response strategies to control communicable disease spread following an event. These educational materials need to be provided in a variety of formats and targeted to each occupation/group for maximum benefit. It is important for the APIC to create educational materials that consist of synthesized information from existing sources, such as documents developed by the CDC and/or other public health agencies. These educational materials can be implemented by IPs in health care and community settings to prevent or control communicable disease spread. In addition, participants recommended that the APIC develop a document that outlines the role an IP will play in emergency management. Doing so will clarify for IPs exactly how and to what extent they should be involved in emergency management. This information can ultimately be developed into a curriculum for the APIC EPI courses or other continuing education for IPs.",

Although some states already have a valid system for this service in place, it is not implemented nationwide consistently. The infrastructure for this service currently exists at the national level through the APIC. However, many response agencies are not aware of this system. The APIC needs to develop a communications protocol to better publicize this infrastructure so that response agencies can quickly gain access to IPs to assist in emergency management during a disaster. This service would be of great help during a disaster and would position the APIC as a leader among emergency management agencies. The next step in this process is for the APIC to create a communications plan that includes a protocol for communication coordination, outlining the APIC communications capability, and identifying points of contact with members and response agency partners at the local, state, and federal level.",
