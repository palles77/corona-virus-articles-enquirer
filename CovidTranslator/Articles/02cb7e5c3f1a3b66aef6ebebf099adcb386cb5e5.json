And, although we recognize that microorganisms don't operate in isolation but are usually members of communities, structural biology is proving invaluable in understanding how microbial cellular processes function at the molecular level.",

The Journal of Virology and the Journal of Bacteriology both feature sections that showcase structural information. Funding bodies in the United Kingdom, such as the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, have set up six research centres that concentrate solely on structural biology. Similarly, there are numerous structural biology centres in the United States and worldwide.",

The recent publication of X-ray crystal structures of the haemagglutinin from the 1918 influenza virus sheds new light on how avian influenza viruses might jump the species barrier and potentially cause pandemics 1,2 . Only nine months after the identification of the SARS coronavirus as the causative agent of a new type of pneumonia, the structure of its main protease was solved, providing a basis for researchers to rationally design anti-SARS drugs 3 . Reovirus, adenovirus and HIV-1 are three viruses for which collaborative teams are working towards solving the structures of all the viral proteins.",

The structures of all three proteins that comprise the anthrax toxin, and now small-molecule inhibitors of the toxin, have been reported 4 . Structural studies are now central to devising and designing new anti-infective therapies and investigating host-pathogen interactions.",

One study demonstrated that a quorum-sensing molecule that enables communication in some Gram-negative bacteria contains boron 5 . This was the first demonstration of a potential biological role for boron. Nitrogen fixation, which is restricted to bacterial and archaeal species and is crucial in global nitrogen cycling, has long been a favourite topic for study by microbial geneticists and physiologists. When the structure of bacterial nitrogenase was determined, a 'light' atom, probably nitrogen, was detected in the enzyme cofactor 6 . This could prove pivotal in understanding how nitrogen is fixed. Our understanding of cell division, DNA replication and transcription has similarly been revolutionized by determining the structures of some of the proteins involved.",
