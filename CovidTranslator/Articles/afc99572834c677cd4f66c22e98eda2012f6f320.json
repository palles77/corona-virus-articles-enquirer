Antigenspecific immunotherapy and the employment of proteasome inhibitors have emerged as two potentially plausible approaches for the control of cancer. In the current study, we explored the combination of the DNA vaccine encoding calreticulin (CRT) linked to human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV-16) E7 antigen (CRT/E7) with the proteasome inhibitor; bortezomib for their ability to generate E7-specific immune responses and antitumor effects in vaccinated mice. We found that the combination of treatment with bortezomib and CRT/E7(detox) DNA generated more potent E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and better therapeutic effects against TC-1 tumors in tumor bearing mice compared to monotherapy. Furthermore, we found that treatment with bortezomib led to increased apoptosis of TC-1 tumor cells and could render the TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to lysis by E7-specific CTLs. Our data has significant implications for future clinical translation.",

Intradermal administration of CRT linked to any of these target antigens led to a significant increase in the antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and impressive antitumor effects. Thus, CRT has been shown to be highly potent in enhancing the antigen-specific immune responses and antitumor effects generated by DNA vaccination in several preclinical models.",

            "text": "pNGVL4a-CRT/E7detox (4a-CRT/E7d) was obtained from the NIH National Gene Vector Laboratory. A second-generation plasmid from pNGVL-3, pNGVL4a encodes a kanamycinresistance gene and a transcription unit consisting of a CMV promoter, multiple cloning site, followed by a poly-A tail. It contains two short immunostimulatory DNA sequences (ISS) in the non-coding region of the backbone. The ISS sequences are derived from a bacterial ampicillin-resistance gene and consist of tandem repeats of a CpG dinucleotide in the base context, 5\u2032-AACGTT-3\u2032. It has been demonstrated that an ISS-containing pDNA can elicit the production of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 in transfected keratocytes and dermal APCs, which results in a potent T helper cell type 1 response. This vector also contains a transcription unit that yields high levels of Ag expression and its DNA adjuvant unit elicits strong immunologic Th1 type responses against the pDNA-encoded protein. E7 oncogenic protein detox form has substituted amino acids at positions 24 (glycine in place of cysteine) and 26 (glycine in place of glutamic acid). These substitutions have been shown to inhibit E7 protein binding to pRb at position 11, abating E7's ability to transform cells. Thus, it more adequately used in clinical trials.",

TC-1 tumor cells were treated with bortezomib with or without E7-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL). Untreated TC-1 tumor cells and TC-1 cells treated with E7-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) alone were used as controls. The CTL-mediated killing of the TC-1 tumor cells in each well was monitored using bioluminescent imaging systems. This assay has been used previously by us [24] and others [25] and the degree of CTL-mediated killing of the tumor cells has been shown to correlate with the decrease of luminescence activity. As shown in Figure 5 , the lowest luciferase activity was observed in the wells with TC-1 incubated with bortezomib and E7-specific cytotoxic T cells as compared to the wells incubated with bortezomib alone or E7-specific cytotoxic T cells alone. Thus, our data suggests that the TC-1 tumor cells treated with bortezomib increased the susceptibility of the tumor cells for lysis by the E7-specific cytotoxic T cells. We also observed that treatment with bortezomib alone led to a higher degree of TC-1 tumor cell death compared to CTLs alone using the specified conditions for the in vitro study. However, the observed effect may depend on the concentration of bortezomib and/or the number of CTLs used in the in vitro killing assay. We also performed a CTL killing assay using TC-1 tumors treated with different concentrations of bortezomib. We observed that TC-1 cells treated with increasing doses of bortezomib demonstrated enhanced CTL-mediated killing (Supplementary Figure 1) . Thus, our results indicate that the TC-1 tumor cells treated with increasing doses of bortezomib increased the susceptibility of the tumor cells for lysis by the E7-specific cytotoxic T cells.",

Furthermore, HPV-16 is a \"high-risk\" type and is associated with more than 50% of all cervical cancers (For review see [27] ). The HPV early viral protein, E7 is a potentially ideal target antigen since it is a completely foreign antigen and is expressed early in viral infection.

It has been reported that proliferating T cells, and not resting T cells are highly sensitive to bortezomib-mediated cytotoxicity [28] . In the current study, we administered bortezomib before the second DNA vaccination. This would increase the susceptibility of the treated TC-1 tumors without compromising the E7-specific CD8+ T cells since the first DNA vaccination in general does not result in significant number of proliferative antigen-specific CD8+ T cells (also see Figure 3 ). Thus, for eventual clinical translation, it will be important to determine the timing of administration of bortezomib in order to generate enhanced therapeutic antitumor effects using DNA vaccines.",

The apoptotic tumor cells may potentially be taken up by antigen-presenting cells, resulting in the activation of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells (so called cross-priming mechanism). We have previously observed that treatment of the tumor with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) led to apoptotic tumor cell death, resulting in higher levels of E7 peptide-loaded dendritic cells in the draining lymph nodes of tumor-bearing mice [29] . This increase in the levels of E7 peptide-loaded dendritic cells resulted in an increased number of E7-specific CD8+ T cell precursors in treated mice. Thus, treatment with EGCG significantly boosted the potency of the CRT/E7 DNA vaccine, by enhancing the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses and antitumor effects. Similarly, treatment with bortezomib also led to apoptotic tumor cell death, thus enhancing CRT/E7 DNA vaccine potency. Therefore, it would be of interest to observe if the degree of apoptotic cell death generated by these reagents correlates with the ability to enhance the DNA vaccine potency.",

            "text": "We observed that treatment with bortezomib rendered the E7-expressing TC-1 tumor cells more susceptible to killing by the E7-specific CD8+ T cells. Several mechanisms may account for the observed phenomenon. For example, bortezomib may lead to upregulation of MHC class I, resulting in increased recognition of antigenic peptide-MHC class I complex by E7-specific CD8+ T cells. However, we have characterized the expression of MHC class I and B-7 on TC-1 tumor cells following treatment with bortezomib. We did not find significant change in the levels of MHC class I and B-7 on TC-1 cells (data not shown). Furthermore, it has been reported that tumor cells treated with bortezomib does not lead to increased expression of MHC class I molecules [30] . Alternatively, treatment with bortezomib may lead to increased expression of E7 protein and/or death receptors (DR). It has been shown that renal cell carcinoma cells treated with bortezomib demonstrated upregulation of DR5 [30] . Furthermore, it has been reported that treatment of tumors with bortezomib can lead to the upregulation of molecules that may sensitize tumors for apoptotic cell death, such as Fas, rendering tumors more susceptible to immune cells expressing death ligands, such as FasL [31] . We have characterized the expression of FasL on the E7-specific CD8+ T cells and we found that our E7-specific CD8+ T cells do express FasL (See Supplementary Figure 2 ). In addition, TC-1 cells have been shown to express Fas [32] . Thus, our data indicates the sensitization of the tumor by bortezomib (presumably by upregulation of Fas on tumor cells) may contribute to the enhanced cytotoxic killing by E7specific CD8+ T cells. It would be of interest to further characterize and manipulate these molecules in order to illustrate the mechanism for the increased susceptibility of the TC-1 tumors to the killing by E7-specific CD8+ T cells.",
