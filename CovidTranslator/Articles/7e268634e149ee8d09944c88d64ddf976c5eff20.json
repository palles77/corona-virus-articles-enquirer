In the near future, pharmacoproteomics, the use of proteomic technologies in the field of drug discovery and development, and interactomics, the branch of proteomics which is concerned with identifying interactions between proteins, will allow researchers to (i) know the specific protein changes that occur in biological compartments in response to drug administration; (ii) design small novel therapeutic molecules that can have extended half-lives if carried by plasma protein in the blood stream. Advances in these fields will open new avenues of tailormade molecular therapy, reducing present limitations on treatment arising from toxicity and inefficiency.In this short review we report and discuss the most recent developments arising from the use of proteomic tools in blood plasma protein research, looking at the identification of proteins found in plasma as well as their interactions with small molecules such as drugs, peptides, organic chemicals and metals. We believe this research demonstrates that proteomic technologies, and in particular pharmacoproteomics, interactomics and post-translational modification analysis, could be instrumental in the design of new tailor-made drugs leading to substantial improvements in molecular therapy.",

            "text": "Blood plasma is the most complex human-derived proteome. Because of this complexity, and the enormous range of concentration encountered across the population of protein components, spanning in excess of ten orders of magnitude, whole blood plasma is the most difficult specimen to analyze, and this creates serious challenges for proteomics. Much progress has already been made in this field and new directions have been put forward and discussed as part of the HUPO Plasma Proteome Project (PPP), to focus efforts on the remaining challenges [1] . The PPP initiative has three stated long-term goals (i) to make a comprehensive analysis of the protein constituents of plasma; (ii) to determine the extent and source of variation in an individual's plasma over time; and (iii) to determine the extent of variation in plasma between individuals within and across populations [2] . Blood plasma is known to contain proteins derived from blood cells and other body tissues that may have ended up there through cell death or damage (causing proteins to be released from normal cells), or they may come from aberrant protein secretions from tumor cells. In a recent investigation [3] , the examination of the plasma protein component categories revealed that many of the proteins detected in plasma are normally associated with cells (i.e. they are not known plasma proteins). These 'cellular leakage proteins' were categorized according to their original location and function. Intracellular proteins accounted for up to 42% of the proteins identified, while membrane-associated proteins, including those proteins that are membrane-based but not known to be released in plasma (i.e. receptors, coreceptors and adhesion molecules) [3] accounted for another 13%. Another 5% of the proteins were found to be of cellular origin, and are either secreted or occupy an extracellular location, and 3% were identified as specific cytokines or cytokine-related proteins. All these proteins are generally considered passenger proteins (some more transient than others) that utilize plasma for transportation, localization and mediation of cellular responses. Overall, this group is the least characterized but possibly the most interesting one in terms of potential to yield biomarkers, with protein concentrations believed to range from low mg/ml to pg/ml levels, and possibly extending to levels below the detection limits of traditional ELISA assays (1 pg/ ml).",

Approximately 34% of the proteins identified, however, had no known function [3] . Hence, with such a diverse population of proteins derived from a range of sources we might expect that the analysis of the extracellular proteome of proteins circulating in the plasma and the cell-based proteome are necessary and complementary for an exhaustive plasma investigation. One strategy applied in several recent examples involves using a secondary tissue or fluid of interest to first identify potential candidates for biomarkers and then screening the complementary plasma sample for their presence. Such an investigation is highly desirable because disease markers present in plasma may include proteins with significant potential for early disease diagnosis, containing information that directly reflects pathophysiological states and represents an invaluable source of diagnostic information for a variety of different diseases [4] . Thus, a broad inventory of plasma proteins (both qualitative and quantitative) could be used for the identification of putative protein markers for any diagnosable disease as well as for the development of new therapeutic products [4] .",

They may, in fact, be described as molecular sponges, which bind and transport low molecular weight (LMW) protein/peptide species preventing their rapid clearance by the renal system, thereby extending their half-life in the blood stream. Although it has been estimated that 32% human plasma proteins do not display associations with the major proteins, about 48% have been found in association with IgG and 20% of proteins have also been found with HSA codepleted groups, suggesting the possibility of weak overlapping interactions between some proteins and both HSA and IgG (see Fig. 1 ). Moreover, because proteins in the circulatory system are exposed to a variety of proteases or chemical oxidations [5, 6] , plasma is rich in peptides, the so-called 'peptidome' (see Box 1) from which about 5000 peptides have been revealed [7] , prevalently associated with the carrier proteins. If Igs are retained in the sample during peptide-based proteomic studies, they can act as a generous source of random peptide sequences contributing to a large library of 'background' species that, because of their abundance (20 mg/ml sample concentration) and variety, greatly complicate the process of peptide detection and identification.",

In fact, small plasma proteins such as the basic proline-rich peptide p-e (Ib-9, MW = 6020 Da, IgG codepleted protein) show more interaction specificity than large proteins such as cardiac titin isoforms (MW = 2,991,181 Da) that are typically found in more than one protein interaction group [3] . This kind of information, concerning the interactions between human plasma proteins, should be useful for further studies in human blood systems/network biology, such as evaluating possible protein contaminants in therapeutic protein products prepared from human plasma, and for the design of analytical approaches to deplete high abundance plasma proteins effectively. Additionally, it could be used to help design proteins with a reduced rate of clearance from the circulatory system, particularly important when small proteins are used as therapeutic agents [8] . Normally, small uncomplexed proteins and peptides (i.e. less than 40 kDa) are rapidly cleared from the circulation through enzymatic degradation, uptake by the reticuloendothelial system or by glomerular filtration, which discriminates on the basis of molecular size and charge [8] . It is believed that the circulation half-life of this LMW fraction is directly related to its binding affinity to large high abundant carrier proteins.",

The dynamic range of currently available proteomic techniques such as mass spectrometry (MS) or 2D gel electrophoresis (2-DE) spans three to four orders of magnitude and as such does not approach the ten orders of magnitude represented by the plasma proteins. Thus, a significant challenge for proteomic analysis of plasma is how to reveal the low-abundance proteins. The strategies that have been most frequently used to overcome the dynamic range problem are to fractionate the plasma proteome into smaller subsets, and/or to deplete one or more of the major proteins. Immunoaffinity is the most efficient way to deplete proteins and so these methods are most widely used [11] [12] [13] . Immobilized antibodies packed in columns or cartridges capture several the most abundant proteins lowering the protein content down to 1% of the initial amount. Although nontarget proteins are removed in this process, it has been shown to be reproducible [14] . Multiple orthogonal separation steps have also been used, such as strong cation exchange chromatography followed by reverse phase-liquid chromatography (RP-LC) [8] or insolution isoelectric focusing (IEF) [15] . Recently, a novel separation approach has been proposed, using 2D free-flow electrophoresis (FFE), separating proteins and peptides in solution according to their pI before LC-MS/MS [16] . A commercial combinatorial ligand library (ProteoMiner) is now available, enabling researchers to pick out the low-abundance proteins [17] .

These results suggest that, on the one hand, albumin or IgG depletion before protein identification may actually eliminate many valuable biomarkers but, on the other hand, the identification of biomarkers, through the selective isolation of protein bound to the more abundant proteins in serum, could be a novel proteomic strategy.

Nevertheless, blood is still the logical choice of biospecimen and has become the most frequently used biomarker discovery matrix to date, because the driving force of biomarker discovery is the development of blood-based assays for early detection and prediction of therapeutic response [20] . It follows that if protein biomarkers have been identified in biopsied tissues, researchers will then be able to examine the blood to determine whether these biomarkers are in circulation. The great advantage being that blood tests are much less invasive than biopsies. The downside is that once such proteins are released into around 6 liters of plasma, their concentration is extremely low. Hence, the need to extend the dynamic range of protein detection and this is where proteomics comes into its own. Although blood is a very convenient and noninvasive fluid to monitor for biomarkers, it poses many challenges from the perspective of protein detection.",

Among the challenges facing clinical proteomics is the ability to link protein expression profiles to specific disease phenotypes and the identification of relevant biomarkers to develop diagnostic tools [21] . In this sense, proteomics is an expansion of reductionist biology, where single proteins are analyzed in a high throughput fashion to arrive at an understanding of the entire system. The intention is that, once the human blood proteome has been fully described, several biomarkers will emerge for each particular disease state that can be used to provide a 'fingerprint' of that disease and here, there are obvious implications for blood donor testing [22] . There are already systematic searches underway to look for plasma proteins that are biological indicators or biomarkers for cancer (see Refs. [23, 24] ). If a suite of biomarkers were to be available for early detection, stratification into distinct subtypes and monitoring of progression or response to therapy we could expect significant improvements in clinical outcomes for cancer patients. The intention is to develop panels of biomarkers that will allow early detection of cancer and prediction of the probable response to therapy, possibly detectable in a single proteomics experiment. Despite the recent progress in proteomic technologies based on MS, however, the discovery of novel clinical assessment tools has been slow. This is partly because of the inherent difficulties in working with blood. It is hoped that a better understanding of the limitations of blood for comparative protein profiling and an appreciation of the advantages of cancer tissue or cancer cell secretomes will greatly enhance the progress [25] .",

It was found that protein expression of the TTR tetramer and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) was downregulated by up to 1.68 and 3.62 times, respectively, in schizophrenia patients compared to normal controls [26] . A study that revealed potential diagnostic cancer biomarkers used blood from SJL (selected by James Lambert) mice, in which the growth of RcsX lymphoma cells induces an inflammatory response by stimulating V b 16+T cells [27] . After the depletion of albumin and immunoglobulin, 1079 mouse NR proteins were identified in SJL mouse plasma in a single experiment. Most were found to be upregulated (e.g. acute phase reactants) but some proteins were found to be unique to the tumor-bearing mouse plasma (i.e. haptoglobin, proteosome subunits, fetuin-B, 14-3-3 zeta and MAGE-B4 antigen). While it remains to be seen whether a similar unique profile occurs in human lymphomas, recent studies have demonstrated that in sepsis and cancer, the interalpha inhibitor proteins (IaIps), a family of structurally related serine protease inhibitors, are present in relatively high concentrations in human plasma, suggesting their suitability as potential biomarkers [28] .",

Protein drug-activity biomarkers can be defined as specific protein changes in total protein content in biological compartments that occur in response to drug administration [29] . In contrast to genomic approaches, the application of pharmacoproteomics, by virtue of being stimulus-induced, may be more amenable to systematic experimental manipulation that could ultimately result not only in validation of a biomarker, but also in characterizing its behavior under specific conditions [30] . In association with chemical compound library screening strategies, pharmacoproteomics is expected to accelerate the discovery of new lead compounds for future drugs. It should also play an important part in preclinical studies by providing information on the mode of action and the eventual deleterious side effects of drugs.

Recently, however, differential scanning calorimetry has provided a new window into the plasma proteome. Thermograms of plasma from diseased individuals not only were found to differ dramatically from those of normal (control)_individuals, but also differed between sufferers of different illnesses, at least for the three diseases examined (arthritis, Lyme disease and lupus). Each disease appears to have a distinctive and characteristic thermogram. These radically different thermograms seen for different diseased states seem to arise from binding interactions involving as yet unknown biomarkers with the more abundant plasma proteins, particularly albumin. Such behavior is consistent with the 'interactome' hypothesis, suggesting a novel use for calorimetry as a diagnostic tool [34] . For a careful approach to clinical design and data analysis it is important to maximize the chance of discovering meaningful drug-activity markers. The first step is to establish a link between drug administration and the resulting biologically quantified change [35] . This strong foundation should set the stage for any data-driven hypothesis generation and testing, and further establish the utility of such a multidisciplinary tool in expanding the frontiers of clinical research. Too often there is no information available on the tissue under investigation, in these circumstances protein-profile changes in response to drug treatment can serve as evidence of cell pharmacodynamic activity, and such data can be used to establish a minimum dose for early clinical studies. More broadly, because targeted proteomics can also be hypothesis generating, detecting a drug-induced change can also lead to new lines of research and inquiry in the field of drug development or pathophysiology. A clear understanding of proteomic variability under controlled conditions is crucial to enable future clinical studies to be appropriately designed and to improve the contextual interpretation of data obtained from pharmacoproteomic studies. It is also important to establish a suitable time period between drug administration and analysis primarily to allow sufficient time for a tissue-targeted drug to reach a pharmacokinetic steady state before exploring protein profile changes [36] . This is to ensure minimal interference from extraneous factors on endogenous variability, thus maximizing the probability of identifying even subtle drug-induced changes. The variability between individual subjects could potentially affect observations in unpaired comparison studies, such as diseased versus healthy volunteers, and should be taken into account [37] . In other words, we cannot assume that pharmacodynamic responses to identical chemical or biochemical stimuli will be similar among healthy individuals and that these responses will differ significantly and consistently in patients with pathological disorders, because a variety of factors will influence the profile of each individual [37] . This aspect requires further investigation to ascertain how useful biomarkers will ultimately prove to be and what consequence this will have for drug development.",

During the past two decades, sensitive MS methods have been refined to determine the type and site of protein modifications that can seldom be predicted from a genomic sequence [38] . Some of the protein modifications are regulatory and reversible, most notably phosphorylation which controls protein functions such as localization, complex formation, stability and activity through different mechanisms [39] . As a result of extensive research, we now know that about 30% of all human proteins can be modified by phosphorylation, while only 0.05% of the phosphorylated residues are tyrosine [40] . Protein phosphorylation is one hallmark of the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) underlying signaling networks and, in many cases, it is aberrant protein kinase activity that drives diseaseassociated derangements in signaling pathways. The aim would be to design drugs that effectively disrupt this aberrant proteinphosphorylation-based enzymatic activity and epigenetic phenomena. Pharmacoproteomics, or the tailoring of therapy based on proteomic knowledge, is expected to take a central role in this process [41] .",

Protein microarrays that examine protein-protein recognition events (i.e. phosphorylation) in a global, high-throughput manner have been used to profile cellular signal pathways in a way not possible with gene arrays [43, 44] . The activity levels of the proteins in a particular pathway can thereby be assessed in 'real time', to tailor treatment to each patient's cellular 'circuitry' [45] [46] [47] . The advantage of protein microarrays lies in their ability to provide a 'map' of known cellular signaling proteins that generally reflect the state of information flow through protein networks in individual specimens. The identification of crucial nodes or interactions within the network (see later) is a potential starting point for drug development and the design of individual therapeutic regimens [48] [49] [50] . Accurate annotation of peptide modifications through unrestrictive database searches can reveal post-translational modifications, as well as sequence polymorphisms [51] .",

In fact, while nucleated cells contain 20,000-30,000 proteins [31, 67, 68] , red blood cells (RBCs), which lack nuclei and other organelles, contain far fewer. A comprehensive list of RBC proteins known to date contains 751 entries obtained using proteomics technology [69] . The resulting PPI network is depicted in Fig. 3 [70] . The network presented here was derived from protein interaction data obtained from the Unified Human Interactome (UniHI) [71] . The correlation reported by UniHI is derived from gene expression experiments and represents a measure of confidence for the interaction [72] . As the knowledge of PPIs continues to increase owing to advances in proteomics research we expect that, in addition to a deeper understanding of the erythrocyte protein complement and how it relates to function, it will also be possible to understand how changes in the RBC proteome and interactome affect the development of erythrocyte disorders [69] .",

The powerful combination of pharmacoproteomics and interactomics may win through despite costs, furnishing new targeted therapies for disease prevention as well as for posttherapy monitoring.",
