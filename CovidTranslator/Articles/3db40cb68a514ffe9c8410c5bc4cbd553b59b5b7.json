            "text": "Historically, a \"fast\" result from the clinical microbiology laboratory is one that is reported within 24 hours of specimen receipt. Recently, there has been a radical movement in the clinical microbiology laboratory to provide expeditious results. One of the most noteworthy developments was the introduction of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), which has successfully replaced traditional biochemical identification methods at many institutions [1] . Other identification-focused approaches are multiplexed PCR [2] and microarray-based technologies [3] . Technological advancements have focused primarily on rapid identification of microorganisms directly from clinical specimens, including syndromic panels that are cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for in vitro diagnostic detection of a variety of organisms within 1 to 3 hours. These rapid identification tests have been remarkable in significantly shortening time to identification and, in some cases, antimicrobial optimization.",

Efforts to provide antimicrobial susceptibility results in a timely manner have been most evident in bloodstream infection syndromic panels [2, 3] , which may detect resistance markers expressed by specific Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Nonetheless, full antimicrobial susceptibility profile testing is required in many instances to allow more targeted therapy. This article describes the approaches to performing AST from clinical specimens/isolates, discusses the benefits and limitations of genotypic and phenotypic testing, and highlights current and emerging rapid susceptibility approaches.",

When choosing an empiric antimicrobial regimen, the clinician must weigh the risk of poor patient outcome from potentially under-treating a drug-resistant pathogen against the societal importance of antimicrobial stewardship [9] . Complicating this are patient-specific factors, including medication allergies, renal or hepatic disease, and drug interactions (Table 1) . Formulary restrictions add another layer of intricacy to the situation. While it is difficult to choose the best empiric agent, clinicians depend on the results from the microbiology laboratory to select the most appropriate, targeted therapy. Traditionally, this has been dependent on culture and susceptibility results, although that paradigm may be shifting.",

Clinicians may not always appreciate that the MIC does not necessarily reflect efficacy; rather, it is simply a laboratory value reflecting a relationship between drug concentration and organism killing. Determining whether a given medication can be used for a particular microbe or infection type requires knowledge of the medication's pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) parameters [10] . PK describes the interaction between the drug and the host: absorption, distribution, and elimination. PD details the effect of the drug on the organism. The combination of PK/PD parameters, along with the MIC and several other factors, such as clinical outcome data and MICs for isolates with known mechanisms of resistance, leads to the creation of clinical breakpoints and guides the clinical laboratory's reporting strategies for susceptibility.",

Sometimes, an \"intermediate\" result is reported, which generally indicates that the MIC or zone diameter may be more difficult to overcome than for \"susceptible\" isolates, but clinical efficacy might still be achieved, depending on the dosage or site of infection. Adding to the complexity is the more recent category of \"susceptible-dose dependent,\" used when there is evidence that a more aggressive dosing regimen can be used to treat an infection with an MIC above susceptible but below resistant. This is different from intermediate. Occasionally, a report of \"nonsusceptible\" may be seen. In this case, only a breakpoint for susceptible exists because resistance is exceedingly rare. Nonsusceptible does not mean that the isolate has a resistance mechanism. Instead, it indicates that there is only evidence to support a definition for susceptibility. Finally, there are some drugs (i.e., colistin) that only have epidemiological cutoff values (ECVs), defined as the upper limit of susceptibility for the wildtype population of isolates. It is important to emphasize that ECVs are not clinical breakpoints and are provided for informational purposes only [11] .",

Disk diffusion depends upon the ability of antibiotic molecules to diffuse out from a disk into the agar, forming a circular zone. The zone diameter is measured after 18 to 24 hours of incubation and compared to standardized charts, allowing qualitative susceptibility interpretations [10, 12] . In addition to disk diffusion, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recognizes two other reference standard AST methods: broth microdilution and agar dilution [13] . These two methods offer MIC results alongside clinical breakpoint interpretation. In contrast, a limitation of the disk diffusion method is the absence of an MIC result, and only the breakpoint interpretation is reported to clinicians.",

This is most evident in the case of infections by Gram-positive bacteria (Table 3) . Ruling out methicillin resistance in an S. aureus bloodstream infection based on the absence of mecA expression allows de-escalation from vancomycin to an anti-staphylococcal beta-lactam agent (cefazolin, oxacillin, or nafcillin) within a few hours rather than days. On the other hand, early detection of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus species by detection of vanA or vanB ensures escalation of antimicrobial therapy if the patient is on vancomycin empiric therapy. Several studies have supported positive patient outcomes when rapid genotypic susceptibility results were available within hours of blood culture positivity [18, 19] . In one, there was a decrease in the treatment of coagulase-negative staphylococcal bacteremia and a more rapid change to appropriate therapy for VRE bacteremia [20] . Another group demonstrated faster initiation of appropriate ESBL bacteremia therapy and a reduction in intensive care unit length of stay [21] .",

Unfortunately, additional phenotypic susceptibility testing using commercial systems may also interpret these isolates as falsely susceptible [25] . In an attempt to avoid potential false negatives caused by mecC-harboring MRSA, the Xpert MRSA Gen 3 (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA), was recently FDA cleared as a molecular test to screen for MRSA using both mecA and mecC [26] .

The FilmArray BCID panel also includes targets for five Candida species. Numerous studies on the performance of these panels reported high agreement for both identification and resistance genes compared to conventional identification and AST methods [2, 27] . The mecA and vanA vanB genes have high predictive value for S. aureus susceptibility to oxacillin and/or cefoxitin and enterococcal susceptibility to vancomycin, respectively [2, 27] . Discrepancies between molecular and phenotypic results may be seen. The CLSI provides a guide to assist laboratorians in investigating these situations, which includes recommendations for reporting when there is discordance between molecular and phenotypic assays for S. aureus (oxacillin), Enterococcus spp. (vancomycin), and Enterobacteriaceae (extended-spectrum beta-lactams).

The pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance is the generation of MIC values using a morphokinetic cellular analysis of individual immobilized bacterial cells every 10 minutes in the presence or absence of antimicrobial agents. For each drug-specific test, a single concentration of antibiotic is used to provide MICs and categorical interpretations of susceptible, intermediate, or resistant in approximately 7 hours. This represents an innovative first step in the quest for rapid phenotypic susceptibility tests. The clinical trial was conducted across 13 U.S. institutions on 872 prospective clinical samples and 1,068 seeded samples [31] . The essential agreement (EA) and categorical agreement (CA) ranged from 94.3% to 97.9%, with \u22641.0 major error (ME) or very major error (VME).

The investigators reported a substantial decrease in time to susceptibility results of almost 42 hours compared to standard-of-care testing, with a reduction in hands-on time of about 30 minutes [32] . The test does not eliminate the need to subculture positive blood cultures to ensure detection of other organisms not included in the panel. However, in the majority of cases, the PhenoTest BC can function as a standalone test in the sense that subsequent AST from culture is not required.",

Doern and colleagues [33] reported promising disk diffusion AST results from 555 blood cultures using a \"quick and dirty\" approach of 6 drops of blood culture broth on Mueller-Hinton agar. Numerous studies have also reported high agreement compared to conventional AST using such approaches as generating a bacterial cell pellet to test on commercial automated AST systems [34, 35] . Unfortunately, these approaches are not widespread in clinical laboratories for reasons including limited resources and expertise, regulatory concerns over using laboratorydeveloped tests, and a low sense of urgency due to the perception that patients are on appropriate empiric therapy. Therefore, in order to ensure widespread dissemination in clinical laboratories, development of direct-from-specimen AST systems at a reasonable/low cost needs to be a priority. For instance, a recent proof-ofconcept study from the CLSI AST Subcommittee ad hoc working group on direct AST from blood cultures was conducted with the goal to develop and standardize a direct from blood culture AST that can be performed in all laboratories. Preliminary data indicate CAs between 94.7% and 96.2% after an 18-hour incubation [36] .",

The initial panel will offer testing on Gram-negative bacilli from positive blood cultures using a customized Sensititre plate that allows MIC determination and breakpoint interpretation in approximately 3 hours. Since there is no identification feature, a drawback is that the system is reliant on the adoption of a rapid identification test in the clinical laboratory to maximize the utility of the test. Another upcoming assay is the Smarticle (Roche, Pleasanton, CA), which uses recombinant bacteriophages with DNA probes that bind to specific bacterial targets to deliver a custom-designed DNA molecule that causes viable bacteria to express luciferase. For example, the absence of luciferase expression in a sample mixed with a defined concentration of antibiotic would be interpreted as susceptible.
