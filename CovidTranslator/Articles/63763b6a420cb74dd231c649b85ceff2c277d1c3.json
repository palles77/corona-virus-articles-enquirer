Over the last 100 years we have moved from the pre-antibiotic era through the antibiotic era into the era of emerging infectious diseases. The discovery of new infectious diseases and the steady increase in the number of microorganisms that are resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents have altered the practice of medicine within the hospital, and are affecting the management of infections in the ambulatory care setting 6, 7 .",

            "text": "It is in this scenario where community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) has emerged as the most common pathogen isolated from patients with skin and soft-tissue infections attending to the emergency departments in many United States and Australian cities 8, 9 , and at present, its incidence is increasing in other parts of the world 10, 11 . Despite the growing prevalence of MRSA in hospitals, these strains have been uncommon in the community. In many circumstances MRSA escape into the community when patients still harbouring the organisms are discharged or when hospital personnel go from work to home. These strains can be associated with infections that begin in the community, but the isolates are hospital-associated. However, there is now an increasing number of reports of MRSA infections in the community that have not escaped from the hospitals, and no longer can MRSA be considered as an exclusively nosocomial pathogen. There is molecular evidence that strains of MRSA have also evolved in the community, are well adapted to survive there, and are causing an epidemic outside the hospitals 12, 13 . CA-MRSA infections refer to MRSA infections in patients lacking established MRSA risk factors and without a previous history of MRSA infection or colonization: they do not have a medical history in the past year of hospitalization, healthcare-related admission (to a nursing home, skilled nursing facility or hospice), dialysis, surgery, or implantation of a permanent indwelling catheter or other medical devices 8, 14 . CA-MRSA tends to cause infections that occur in clusters or small outbreaks that affect otherwise healthy and unique populations such as children and young adults, Australian Aborigines, Native Americans, Alaskan Natives, prisoners, military recruits, men who have sex with men, college athletes and players competing in contact sports. Recent antimicrobial exposure is less likely to be reported as a risk for MRSA infections in the community that in health care settings. Most infections are mild and limited to skin and soft tissues, though rapidly fatal invasive infections such as necrotizing fasciitis and overwhelming pneumonia and sepsis accompanied by the Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome do occur and may serve as \"sentinels\" that first bring a more widespread community problem to the attention of public health personnel [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Because skin infections caused by these organisms often have necrotic centers, the disease can be misdiagnosed as a \"spider bite\". Similar to the epidemiology of methicillinsusceptible S. aureus, CA-MRSA infections occur in children in different regions of the United States and throughout the world 11, [21] [22] [23] [24] . Although minor skin and soft-tissue infections predominate, life-threatening invasive disease and death can result. In children, CA-MRSA can cause septic thrombophlebitis of the extremities and a \"pelvic syndrome\" consisting of septic arthritis of the hips, osteomyelitis of the pelvic bones, pelvic abscesses, and septic thrombophlebitis 6 . Unlike hospital strains, which typically are resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents and share a common genotype with other hospital isolates, community acquired strains tend to be susceptible to non-betalactams and have genotypes distinct from hospital isolates in the same community 12 . Two main clones (USA 400 and USA 300, belonging to ST1 and ST8 by MLST, respectively) have been described as responsible for the majority of infections caused by CA-MRSA throughout the United States 12, 25 . In other continents, the most frequent STs of CA-MRSA are the ST30 for the Southwest Pacific clone, and the ST80 for the European clone, although in Europe the ST8 and ST30 clones have also been described 13 . The mecA gene, the genetic determinant necessary for the expression of oxacillin resistance, resides in these strains on genetic elements (usually SCCmec types IV and V) that are different from those encoding methicillin resistance in hospital-acquired MRSA, although in recent years SC-Cmec type IV has been frequently found in nosocomial MRSA isolates mainly in Europe 9, 26, 27 . Another key difference is that almost all CA-MRSA isolates contain genes encoding the Panton-Valentine leukocidin, which is a cytotoxin that causes leukocyte destruction and tissue necrosis. Although the exact role of Panton-Valentine leukocidin in the serious infections caused by these organisms is unclear, it is in general a marker for CA-MRSA 13, 28, 29 .",

This possibility does account for the distinct phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of CA-MRSA. The relatively long time lag from the appearance of MRSA in hospitals to its emergence in the community may in part be due to the low frequency of horizontal chromosomal gene transfer 26 . At present, the knowledge of CA-MRSA epidemiology is incomplete which adds to the challenge of controlling the infection. In addition, nasal colonization may not precede CA-MRSA infections and since nasal carriage is not the prime predictor of subsequent infection it is more difficult to identify and control populations that are at risk. Colonization of the gastrointestinal tract and of household pets may act as additional reservoirs for CA-MRSA 30, 31 . Moreover, CA-MRSA are now being introduced into hospitals, thus blurring the borders between community-acquired and hospital-acquired strains 25 . Therapy for infections due to CA-MRSA includes appropriate drainage of skin and soft-tissue lesions, since milder infections often respond to local incision and drainage alone 15 . The clinician should know when to use drugs with activity against CA-MRSA (clindamycin, minocycline, doxycycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or vancomycin), although optimal antimicrobial agent therapy is unknown. For severe and invasive infections therapy with vancomycin or linezolid should immediately start since antimicrobial agents may be ineffective when the patient receives treatment too late 6, 15 .",

Vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) and heterogenous VISA (hVISA) have become a significant problem in many parts of the world [32] [33] [34] . VISA/hVISA isolates can arise from fully vancomycin-susceptible S. aureus during persistent infection that fails to respond to glycopeptide therapy and are associated with significant phenotypic changes 35 . Resistance may develop by different pathways, but these strains have a thickened cell wall with reduced peptidoglycan crosslinking leading to cell wall \"clogging\" with vancomycin. Moreover, a marked reduction in autolytic activity and reduced cell wall turnover have been found in VISA /hVISA strains 36 . Several studies have demonstrated a number of metabolic pathways and regulatory genes that may contribute to resistance 37 . In particular, the agr twocomponent regulatory system has been linked to low-level vancomycin resistance in S. aureus, with reports suggesting that agr type II strains and loss of agr function are associated with VISA 38 . It has also been noted that many reported VISA infections have involved biomedical devices, and biofilm formation on these devices could be an important initial step in the pathway to vancomycin resistance 39 .",

Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCVs) fall into this category. This variant subpopulation is defective in electron transport, grow slowly, and produce colonies < 10% the size of the parent strain grown on the same medium for the same amount of time. Most of these clinical isolates cannot synthesize menadione or hemin, and these results in a block of electron transport at the level of menaquinone or the cytochromes 40 . SCVs might seem to be less virulent because of their slow growth and decreased production of coagulase and alpha-toxin. However, the intracellular location of SCVs shields them from host defenses, their slow growth reduces the efficacy of cell wall-active antibiotics, and a decreased membrane potential protects them from positively charged antimicrobials 41 . SCVs represent a subpopulation of S. aureus that can cause persistent and recurrent infections. While their overall prevalence has not been firmly established, problems in discovering and identifying these organisms may cause an underestimation or their prevalence 42 .",

These microorganisms can colonize indwelling catheters (including central venous catheters) and form biofilms, that can result in bloodstream infections. The organisms embedded in a matrix of extracellular polymeric substances that they have produced exhibit an altered phenotype with respect to growth rate and gene transcription. Treatment of these infections with conventional antimicrobial agents alone is frequently unsuccessful due to the high tolerance of these agents in microorganisms comprising the biofilm 44 . Several preventative and treatment approaches have been investigated for catheter-related infections including a recent renewed interest in the use of bacteriophages for mitigating biofilm formation on indwelling catheters 45 . Recently, another cause of concern among coagulase-negative staphylococci is their resistance to new antimicrobial agents such as linezolid. Although resistance to linezolid is very infrequent among staphylococci, these organisms are able to acquire de novo resistance among patients who have a long duration of hospitalization and that have received high amounts of linezolid. Moreover, linezolid-resistant strains can be transmitted from patientto-patient with their establishment as part of the skin flora and may be a precursor of linezolid-resistant MRSA 46 .",

In addition, the emergence of strains with high-level resistance to penicillin and to other antimicrobial agents has raised concerns about the current and future effectiveness of antibiotic regimens. Nevetheless, there is now evidence of decreasing resistance to some antimicrobials in some regions of the world. Reduction in antimicrobial use in some community settings has been associated with a decline in resistance of pneumococci to some classes of antimicrobials, mainly beta-lactams. However, we are still witnessing a relentless increase in resistance to the macrolide class of antimicrobials 47 . Fortunately, control of pneumococcal disease through vaccination with the 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine in adults has demonstrated a reduction in risk of bacteremic pneumococcal disease after vaccination, as well as decreased risk of death and complications of hospitalization, which reinforces the need to improve compliance with existing pneumococcal vaccination recommendations for adults. Moreover, the introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine not only prevents invasive disease in children but also appears to have resulted in a decline in the prevalence of resistant serotypes included in the vaccine, resulting in an overall decrease in the prevalence of pneumococcal resistance 48 . However, penicillin-nonsusceptible pneumococcal clones of nonvaccine serotypes have been reported as a cause of bacteremia and other infections. These clones may have been derived from capsular transformation of vaccine-related serotypes 49 .",

Although most cases are foodborne, the epidemiology is complex. Prevention of the disease must include dietary advice on avoiding high-risk foods routinely to pregnant women, to the elderly and to immunocompromised patients. Listeriosis manifests primarily as abortion, septicemia, or central nervous system infections with a high case-fatality rate in all patient groups. Listeria monocytogenes is the third most common cause of bacterial meningitis that occurs among immunocompromised patients and elderly individuals 50 . Symptoms and signs of patients presenting with L. monocytogenes meningitis are not different from those found in the general population of patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, albeit with a longer prodromal phase; however typical cerebrospinal fluid findings predictive for bacterial meningitis might be absent, and Gram stain has a low yield. In patients aged > 50 years old or with risk factors for L. monocytogenes meningitis, an amoxicillin-based empirical antimicrobial regimen is mandatory, since this bacterium is resistant to cephalosporins.",

Group C meningococcal conjugate-vaccine effectiveness in the United Kingdom declines from ~ 90% in the first year to 0% between 1 and 4 years after immunization in infants immunized at 2, 3, and 4 months of age and to 61% in toddlers given a single dose. A recent study 51 did not find evidence of lower immunity in children immunized as infants than as toddlers. On the basis of serum bactericidal activity and/or passive protection, 40-50% of both age groups are protected at 2-3 years after immunization, which is significantly greater than in unimmunized historical controls (< 5%). The study of Snape et al 52 on antibody responses to either a reduced dose of meningococcal C polysaccharide vaccine, which is meant to simulate exposure to N. meningitidis, or meningococcal C conjugate vaccine in healthy 13-15-year-olds in the United Kingdom who had been primed with a serogroup C conjugate vaccine 3-4 years previously, adds new data on the number of days required for antibody levels to increase after boosting with either of the 2 vaccines. In addition to susceptibility associated with flawed complement pathway function, several other pathways have also been convincingly linked to altered host susceptibility to meningococcal disease. The article by Jack et al 53 breaks new ground in increasing the understanding of the human genetic basis for some host defence failures in meningococcal disease. Surfactant protein (SP)-A and SP-D are pattern-recognition molecules of the respiratory tract that activate inflammatory and phagocytic defences after binding to microbial sugars. Variation in the genes of the surfactant proteins affects the expression and function of these molecules.",

            "text": "Routine use of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccines has dramatically decreased the incidence of invasive Hib disease in the western world. Despite the effectiveness of the vaccine, an increase in the incidence of Hib disease has recently been observed in some European countries. Careful analysis of circulating Hib strains is essential for prompt detection of any change in the properties of bacteria, enabling particular clones to overcome the host's immune response. In a recent Italian study 54 , contrary to previous reports, neither increased genetic diversity of Hib strains isolated from children nor the disappearance of individual clones was observed after the rountine immunization of infants against Hib was established; however, an upward temporal trend in proportion of strains possessing multiple copies of the capsulation b locus was detected. The results of this study suggest that vaccine pressure may be positively selecting for strains that harbour amplified cap b sequences. Interactions of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) with human alveolar macrophages are implicated in the persistence of NTHI in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). A recent study by Sethi's group 55 confirmed the hypothesis that immunologic responses of alveolar macrophages to NTHI are impaired in COPD. The same group has described a phenotypic variant of NTHI, Haemophilus haemolyticus that frequently colonizes the airway of COPD patients and is not found in normally sterile sites. These findings substantially strengthen the association of true H. influenzae with clinical infection and exacerbation of chronic bronchitis 56 . The control of pertussis infection is not optimal, because neither vaccination nor natural infection induces long-lived immunity. Increasing proportions of reports of pertussis cases involve adolescents and adults. The aim of a recent US study was to define, among unimmunized control subjects, a yearly infection rate and to characterize the proportion of those infections that include prolonged coughs 57 . A similar analysis was attempted for acellular pertussis (aP)-vaccinated subjects. Pertussis infections in older persons was found to be largely asymptomatic; aP boosters confer protection for adolescents and adults against symptomatic pertussis.The diagnosis of pertussis in older individuals is problematic because of the lack of specific clinical criteria, insensitivity of culture and PCR, and the limited availability of standardized serologic tests and criteria for diagnosis. A Spanish study suggests that real time-PCR is the most sensitive and specific test available for the diagnosis of pertussis and that the direct fluorescent assay should be abandoned 58 .",

            "text": "Three recent studies in Escherichia coli infections deserve comment. The first two deal with fluoroquinolone resistance in this species. The first shows the increasing prevalence of strains with reduced sensitivity to the quinolones in the gut of hospitalized patients 59 , and the second analyses the differences and similarities of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli from humans and from chicken. The similarities among the strains studied strengthen the hypothesis of an animal origin of the human strains of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli 60 . A third study addressed the progressive importance of infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli 61 . Bacteremia caused by these organisms is increasing and given the difficulties encountered in its treatment,-frequent multiresistance to other traditionally used agents,-a reappraisal of current empirical regimens is in order. A very good example of the difficulties found treating ESBL-producing organisms, is the case reported from Israel, a patient with an ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae endocarditis that developed resistance to ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam while on therapy 62 . The presence of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae in the stools of humans, sewage and animals has been found to be high in areas where these studies have been done. From 20 to 100% of the farm animals examined in a recent Spanish study harbour ESBL-producing enteric bacteria 63 . The potential for dissemination of multi-resistance isolates is illustrated by two recent reports: the emergence of Proteus mirabilis carrying the bla metallo-beta-lactamase gene, the first instance in this species 64 , and bla VIM-2 , and bla VIM-7 carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa 65 . Among the latter, the emergence of resistance to carbapenems can be very rapid; when associated with resistance to polimixins the problem at clinical level can become insoluble 66 . Acinetobacter baumannii has recently emerged as a major cause of hospital-acquired infection, because of its propensity to accumulate mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance that lead to pan-drug resistance and cause large nosocomial outbreaks that often involve multiple facilities. The problem is particularly serious in intensive care settings. An ex-cellent review has been published recently on the epidemiology and control of A. baumannii infections in health care facilities 67 . Finally, although rare, communityacquired pneumonia due to A. baumannii is known to occur. A retrospective case-control study (cases: community-acquired pneumonia; controls: hospital acquired pneumonia) from Hong-Kong has been published 68 .",

Cases of pyomiositis and myositis have increased in pediatric patients since 2000 at Texas Children\u00b4s hospital, and this increase appears to correlate with the emergence of CA-MRSA. This study reviews the medical records of all patients admitted in this hospital from 2000 to 2005 with infective pyomyositis and myositis. Forty-five cases were analyzed. Forty percent had negative culture but 57.8% were caused by S. aureus. The number of cases increased from 2000 to 2005 as a result of an increase in the prevalence of CA-MRSA. The thigh and pelvis were the most commonly affected sites. Fifteen out of 24 available S. aureus isolates were CA-MRSA and 9 were community-acquired methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (CA-MSSA). By PFGE, 16 isolates were found to be USA300, and 17 carried the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes. Patients with CA-MRSA, USA300 and/or PVL-positive strains required more drainage procedures that did those with CA-MSSA, non-USA300 and/or PVL-negative strains (81 vs. 40%, 82 vs. 29%, and 81 vs. 38%, respectively). The authors strongly consider coverage for MRSA in the empirical treatment regimen (vancomycin or clindamycin) of these infections in children.",

Although in this study the infections caused by CA-MRSA, USA300, and PVL-positive isolates were more severe than those caused by CA-MSSA, non-USA300, and PVL-negative strains, additional studies are needed to find out the virulence factors associated with muscle infection caused by CA-MRSA. The epidemiology of CA-MRSA among healthy children has been recently described. However, little is known about CA-MRSA in children with underlying medical conditions. The authors compare in this study the clinical and molecular epidemiology of CA-MRSA in children with and without risk factors for health care-associated infections (RF-HAI). A 3-year retrospective cohort study of children with CA-MRSA infection was conducted. RF-HAI, including hospitalization within the past year, indwelling medical devices or chronic medical condition, were identified by chart review. The authors identified 446 episodes of community-acquired S. aureus infections, of which 134 (30%) were caused by MRSA. During the 3-year study period, the proportion of S. aureus infections caused by MRSA rose from 15% (12 of 80) to 40% (93 of 235) (P < 0.001) with the increase noted predominately in children with skin and soft tissue infections. RF-HAI were identified in 56 (42%) patients with CA-MRSA. Among subjects with CA-MRSA, children with RF-HAI were more likely to have had an invasive infection than healthy children (32 versus 5%; P < 0.001). CA-MRSA isolates from children with RF-HAI were similar to those without RF-HAI; all laboratory-retained CA-MRSA isolates harbored the SCCmec type IV cassette, and almost all isolates were susceptible to cotrimoxazole and clindamycin. PFGE revealed greater molecular diversity among CA-MRSA isolates recovered from children with RF-HAI compared with those from otherwise healthy children (P = 0.001). Additionally, CA-MRSA isolates from children with RF-HAI were less likely to be PVL-positive (P < 0.001) and more likely to be resistant to 3 or more classes of antibiotics (P = 0.033).",

A statewide policy of screening all hospital patients and staff who have lived outside the state for MRSA has prevented the establishment of multidrug-resistant epidemic MRSA (mEMRSA), however, this study demonstrates that this policy has not prevented SCCmec type IV and type V MRSA clones (community clones) from becoming established in WA. All MRSA isolated in WA from July 2003 to December 2004 were included in this study. Isolates were recovered from clinical and infection control screenings. Of the 4,099 MRSA isolates analysed (those sent to a reference center), 77.5% were CA-MRSA. Using different molecular methods, a total of 22 different CA-MRSA clones were characterized.

The emergence of multidrug-resistant CA-MRSA clones and the detection of PVL toxin genes in clones previously reported as PVL-negative is a major public health concern. Molecular typing is very important in tracing the origin of isolates and in designing antimicrobial drug prescribing policies for their control, particularly in the community. Some studies have indicated that CA-MRSA strains are generally more virulent than hospital-acquired MRSA, a finding consisting with the ability of CA-MRSA to cause disease in individuals without predisposing risk factors. Although the molecular basis for the enhanced virulence is not known, there is strong association between CA-MRSA infections and the presence of PVL. However, the role that PVL plays in the pathogenesis of CA-MRSA has not been tested directly. In this study the authors evaluated, in a mouse infection model, the role of PVL in the virulence of CA-MRSA as well as the lytic activity and the intracellular survival in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) of isogenic strains of CA-MRSA, expressing or not PVL. They compared the virulence of PVL-positive with that of PVL-negative CA-MRSA representing the leading disease-causing strains. Unexpectedly, strains lacking PVL were as virulent in mouse sepsis and abscess models as those containing the leukotoxin. Isogenic PVLnegative (lukS/F-PV knockout) strains of USA300 and USA400 were as lethal as wild-type strains in a sepsis model, and they caused comparable skin disease. Moreover, lysis of PMNs and pathogen survival after phagocytosis were similar between wild-type and mutant strains.",

The authors investigate the association between the use of fluoroquinolones and the recovery of MRSA in hospitalized patients. Four hospitals located in the same region of France with a similar pre-study incidence of MRSA are selected. The study manoeuvre consists of discontinuing the use of fluoroquinolones in one hospital for the study period, while the three others serve as controls without changing their antibiotic policies. As a consequence, the study hospital reduces the use of fluoroquinolones from 54 to 5 DDD per 1000 bed-days and increases the consumption of amoxicillin-clavulanate by 28%, ceftriaxone by 42%, gentamicin by 35%, amikacin by 25%, erythromycin by 65% and cotrimoxazole by 46%.

The use of pairs of clinically derived, isogenic strains of VSSA and hVISA/VISA will be a valuable resource to elucidate the genetic mechanism of low level glycopeptide resistance in the latter. Staphylococcus aureus small-colony variants (SCVs) are able to persist inside of host cells and to resist antibiotics. This characteristic is especially important when involved in implant-associated infections. The authors analyze 5 cases of hip-prosthesis-associated infections due to SCVs, including their course prior to identification of the pathogen. The patients' mean age was 62.2 years. All patients experienced treatment failures prior to isolation of SCVs, despite as many as 3 surgical revisions and up to 22 months of antibiotics. Transmission electron microscopy performed on biopsy specimens from periprosthetic tissue revealed intracellular cocci in fibroblasts. All prostheses were removed without implanting a spacer, antimicrobial agents were administered for 5.5-7 weeks, and reimplantation of the prostheses was performed for 4 patients.

This study investigates an unusually high incidence of 4% linezolid resistance in coagulase-negative staphylococci (LR-CNS) at their centre in the USA.

Therefore, prospective multicenter studies on this subject would be welcome. After large-scale introduction of the PCV7 vaccine, two effects have become apparent. First, increasing pharyngeal colonization by serotypes not covered by the PCV7 (serotype replacement), and second, acquisition of a new nonvaccine capsule through recombination in naturally transformable clones (serotype swiching). Authors from Taiwan investigated the in vitro capacity of clinical strains of S. pneumoniae isolated in an area with low PCV7 coverage to become transformed (competence) in vitro. A total of 118 strains belonging to 7 serotypes were prospectively collected from Taiwanese hospitals from 2003 to 2005. With the exception of serotype 3, all strains were included in the PCV7. Competence studies were done with the use of two variants of the competence-stimulating peptide (CSP 1 and 2) and the pDL278 plasmid as a vector.

Competence would be a necessary condition, but no sufficient, for explaining the genetic diversity and, secondarily the acquisition of penicillin resistance determinants in S. pneumoniae. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of CAP in adults. Bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia (BPP) is among the most serious forms of pneumococcal disease. This population-based case-control study identifies clini-cal and demographic factors associated with macrolideresistant BPP in adults from 43 acute-care hospitals at the Pennsylvania region. From December 1, 2000, to April 17, 2004 patients included in the study were individuals who 1) were 18 years or more; 2) had at least one blood culture that grew S pneumoniae drawn within 48 hours of hospital admission; 3) resided in one of the five counties surrounding Pennsylvania, and 4) had a bacterial isolate confirmed in the laboratory as S pneumoniae. Seventy-six patients had erythromycin-resistant infections and were selected as the case-patients for this study. The authors found that exposure to macrolides in the six months preceding infection, a history of influenza vaccination in the previous year, and Hispanic ethnicity were all independently associated with an increased probability of erythromycin -resistant S. pneumoniae infection. Among patients who reported taking antimicrobial agents in the 6 months preceding infection, failure to complete the course of prescribed drugs was associated with an increased probability of macrolide resistance ([OR = 3.4]; 95% CI 1.2-9.9). However, most patients with macrolide-resistant infections did not report any prior antimicrobial drug exposures.",

Future studies correlating duration of therapy with risk for colonization with macrolide-resistant pneumococci would be useful to further explore this phenomenon. The incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children and adults increases in winter, however possible underlying causes have not been carefully studied. This ecological study correlated population-based data on IPD and respiratory virus activity in the year 2000 in metropolitan New South Wales, Australia, with climatic parameters. Seven hospitals participated in the study from May to October. During a year with good separation of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus activity, it was demonstrated in children a significant correlation with RSV activity and IPD activity, but no significant correlation between influenza virus activity and IPD. In adults the epidemic curves of RSV and influenza virus activity corresponded with peaks of IPD, but it was only possible to demonstrate a statistically significant correlation when the activity of both viruses was combined. Of the climatic parameters there was a clear inverse relationship between weekly mean minimum and maximum temperatures and IPD activity in adults and children.",

Probably a case-control study comparing the isolation of respiratory viruses in patients with IPD matched with age, sex, location and time with control subjects without IPD would be required to specifically examine the role that respiratory viruses play in predisposing to IPD. The effect of falling temperatures on the pathogenicity of S penumoniae has not been extensively studied and warrants further investigation. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) has been found to be associated with lower respiratory tract infections although the pathogenesis remains to be elucidated. There are few reports of respiratory tract infections due to bacterial coinfection with hMPV. This hypothesis-generating study, performed from March 1998 to October 2002, involved a cohort of 39,836 children in South Africa randomized to receive the 9-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PCV9) or placebo. These that were hospitalised (3.069) for lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) were tested for hMPV infection. By use of a nested reverse-transcription PCR assay targeted at amplifying a fragment of the hMPV fusion protein gene, 202 such infections were identified among 2715 episodes of LRTI in children. In fully vaccinated children, the incidence of hospitalization for a least one episode of hMPVassociated LRTI was reduced by 46% (P = 0.0002) overall, by 45% (P = 0.002) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected children, and by 53% (P = 0.035) in HIV-infected children. There was a significant reduction in the incidence of clinical pneumonia among vaccine recipients overall (58%; P = 0.0001), in HIV-uninfected children (55%; P = 0.003), and in HIV-infected children (65%; P = 0.02).

The results of the present study suggest that bacterial coinfections, particularly pneumococcal infections, are an essential part of the pathogenesis of most severe hMPV infections progressing to pneumonia. An implication of this observation is that children hospitalized with the diagnosis of hMPV-associated pneumonia should be treated with antibiotics, and a significant proportion of these hospitalisations may be prevented by vaccination with pneumococcal vaccine.

In addition, in two isolates this double disk diffusion assay was negative with ceftazidime. The use of 2-mercaptopropionic acid did not enhanced detection of MLB producing P. aeruginosa isolates.

The exclusion of patients infected by strains susceptible to polymyxins but resistant to carbapenems is a major limitation of the study because the over-estimation of the use of carbapenems as a risk factor, prompted by the criteria to select the control group and to exclude patients of the study. Also, the authors do not comment if the occurrence of infections by strains only susceptible to polymyxins was related to outbreaks nor they made molecular analysis of these strains, to be sure that there was not horizontal transmission of them. The objective of this manuscript was to review the non resolved aspects of the infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii. The genus Acinetobacter consists of strictly aerobic, gram-negative cocobacillary rods. Different studies have resulted in the description of 25 genomic species, 17 of the have been validated. In relation with the habitat, Acinetobacter colonize skin of human beings (< 1% A. baumannii); recent studies have shown A. baumannii in unsuspected reservoirs as foods (fruits and vegetables) and arthropods (body lice); A. baumannii has been the cause of infections in traumatic injuries in Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and Vietnam, suggesting environmental contamination of wounds, although the source remains unknown; also, A. baumannii shows tolerance to the desiccation. A. baumannii develops rapidly antimicrobial resistance, related to the use of antimicrobials in hospitals, through multiple mechanisms: plasmids, integrons, transposons, and natural transformation; it results in the frequent appearance of strains resistant to almost all available antimicrobials. The most frequent infections caused by A. baumannii affect respiratory tract, surgical wounds, urinary tract, and bacteraemia. The crude mortality is high in some infections, as bacteraemia and ventilator-associated pneumonia, although they seem have non-attributable mortality in case-control studies. The frequency of infections and colonisations by A. baumannii differs among hospitals, and they are mostly nosocomial; the incidence in paediatric wards is low. The outbreaks of infections by A. baumannii are facilitated by its resistance to the desiccation and antimicrobial resistance; they occurred in all hospital areas, being more frequent in intensive care units; multiple risks factors have been identified, including wards with high density of colonized/infected patients, environmental contamination, and carriage by hands of staff members; the adherence to strict infection-control measures is useful. The complexity of the epidemiology of A. baumannii infections is highlighted by the existence of centres with endemic/epidemic situations in which multiple clones are responsible of colonisations/infections; also, there is coexistence of outbreaks with sporadic cases of infection. There has been transmission of strains among different sanitary centres in several countries. Respect to the treatment, different clinical studies have shown the efficacy of sulbactam and colistin in the treatment of cases of infections caused by multi-drug resistant strains, although there have been contradictory results in experimental models in the case of colistin.",

The authors identify several fields in which we need more knowledge: virulence of A. baumannii, identification of reservoirs, strategies for the control of multi-drug resistant strains, and the treatment of infections caused by these strains. Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen causing, among other infections, hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP). Previously, there were some reports of communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by A. baumannii. The objective of this manuscript was to analyze the clinical and prognostic characteristics of CAP by A. baumannii and to compare them with HAP by this bacterium. The method was a retrospective case-control study (cases: CAP; controls: HAP) carried-out in a regional hospital in Hong Kong between July 2000 and December 2003. Pneumonia was defined by clinical and radiographic criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A. baumannii was considered \"definite pathogen\" if isolated from blood or pleural fluid, and \"probable pathogen\" if isolated from sputum or tracheal aspirate cultures. Nineteen cases (CAP) and 74 controls (HAP) were analyzed. Compared with the HAP, CAP had more smokers (84 vs. 55%; P = 0.03) and more patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (63 vs. 29%; P = 0.01). Also, from a clinical point of view, CAP had bacteraemia more frequently (31 vs. 0%; P < 0.001), as were the presence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (84 vs. 17%; P < 0.001), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (57 vs. 8%; P = 0.001). Finally, the mortality rate at 30 days, was higher in CAP than in HAP (57 vs. 35%; P < 0.001). Factors associated to mortality in CAP were: bacteraemia, low platelet count, acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.",

Patients with S. aureus infections present at or within 72 hours of hospital admission were excluded. Extensive socio-demographic data, discharge diagnoses and concurrent illnesses, drugs administered and laboratory results were recorded. Cox regression analysis yielded a significant association of nosocomial acquisition of MRSA colonization with older age, length of hospital-stay, peptic ulcer disease, and fluoroquinolone administration. Fluoroquinolones were the only antibiotic class being identified as independently associated with colonization and infection with MRSA (Hazard ratios 2.57, 1.84-3.60 and 2.49, 1.02-6.07, respectively). The authors suggest avoiding the use of fluoroquinolones and taking into account their prior use when instituting empiric antibiotic therapy.",

The emergence of CA-MRSA USA 300 genotype as a predominant cause of skin and soft-tissue infections has been also shown in Atlanta (Georgia), an area of high prevalence of CA-MRSA (King M et al. Ann Intern Med 2006;144). In this active, prospective surveillance study, MRSA accounted for 72% of 389 episodes caused by S. aureus. Investigators from the same hospital in the Atlanta area reported the emergence of CA-MRSA USA 300 genotype as a major cause of health care-associated blood stream infections (BSI), in a prospective observational study (Seybold U et al. Clin Infect Dis. 2006;42). In this study, 132 episodes of BSI were documented over 7.5 months; notably, MRSA USA 300 caused both community onset and hospital onset BSI. An active, population-based surveillance for invasive MRSA infections involving 9 U.S. states, coordinated by the CDC, have shown that MRSA strains such as USA 300, which were initially a cause of MRSA infections in the community have migrated into health care settings (Klevens RM et al.
