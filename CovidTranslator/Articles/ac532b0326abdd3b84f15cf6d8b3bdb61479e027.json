Viruses are infectious, obligate intracellular parasites whose genomes consist of either DNA or RNA. Virus genomes direct their own replication and the synthesis of other viral components, using cellular systems in appropriate host cells. Virus particles (known as virions) are formed by assembly from newly synthesized components within the host cell. Virions are the vehicle for transmission of the genome to the next host cell or organism, where their disassembly initiates the beginning of the next infectious cycle. A minimal virus consists of a genome that has an origin of replication, plus a proteinaceous coat, known as a capsid. For enveloped viruses, the capsid is enclosed in a host cell-derived lipid bilayer studded with virus-specified glycoproteins. Viruses are dependent on host cells for biosynthesis of proteins and other critical macromolecules.",

            "text": "Taxonomy is a relational discipline that classifies organisms according to shared and distinguishing properties. The various virus lineages appear to have independent evolutionary origins, thus there is no overriding phylogeny for viruses. The two major classification schemes used for viruses are the comprehensive formal taxonomy developed over the past 40-plus years under the aegis of the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), and a scheme developed by David Baltimore (the Baltimore system) in which viruses are grouped on the basis of the path from their genome type to production of translatable mRNA. The ICTV system will be discussed in this section and the Baltimore system will be discussed in the section on virus replication cycles. Within the ICTV system (King et al., 2011) , the two major taxonomic divisions are the viruses with RNA genomes and those with DNA genomes. Subsequent taxonomic levels are based on the size and structure of the capsid (icosahedreal, helical, or complex) , whether the capsid is enveloped, and then the nature of the genome (single-stranded or double-stranded, linear or circular, segmented or non-segmented). This information is sufficient to define the major groups of genetically distinct viruses into families, with some families being grouped into orders. Families are subdivided into genera, which are collections of related but distinct virus species. Some large families are divided into subfamilies that are then divided into genera. Subfamilies, genera, and species are defined by properties such as gene organization, replication mechanism, susceptibility to physical stresses and chemical agents, cell tropism, and immunologic and pathogenic properties.",

Virions contain the virus genome and proteins that form the capsid that protects the genome ( Fig. 2.1 ). For some viruses, the genome-containing capsid is enclosed in an envelope, which is a lipid bilayer membrane derived from either the host cell plasma membrane or the membrane of an intracellular vesicle. Virion envelopes contain one or more species of virus-specified membrane glycoprotein. Depending on the virus and the complexity of its virion, additional constituents can include mRNAs, proteins that are carried in the space between the capsid and the envelope, and small molecules such as polyamines. Although many virion substructures can self-assemble from purified components, virions are highly organized structures whose construction results in reduced entropy and therefore requires energy. As part of its incorporation into virions, the negatively charged phosphodiester backbone of the virus genome needs to be neutralized, through the use of positively charged amino acids in genome-interacting capsid proteins (nucleoproteins) or by polyamines or other small cationic molecules. Virion assembly involves coordinated manufacture and transport of virion components (e.g., virion proteins and newly replicated virus genomes) to appropriate intracellular locations where the several steps of virion assembly can take place. In addition to needing to be efficiently assembled and to withstand environmental stresses, virions ultimately need to disassemble in an appropriately regulated manner after entry into a newly infected cell. Capsids come in two main forms, icosahedral and helical, and range widely in size and complexity ( Fig. 2.1 ). Icosahedral capsids are formed from triangular subunits that are built from one or more virus capsid proteins. Parvovirus capsids are relatively small and less complex icosahedra, 18-26 nm in diameter, built from a total of 60 molecules of three variants of the single virion protein. In contrast, herpesvirus capsids are icosahedra of 100 nm diameter, built from >1900 individual protein molecules ( Fig. 2.1 ). Helical capsids are formed from nucleoproteins that coat helices of virus genomes to form helical cylinders whose diameter is determined by the size and structure of the capsid protein, and whose length is a function of the length of the virus genome ( Fig. 2.1, rhabdovirus) .",

Some single-stranded RNA virus genomes encode proteins that are expressed from the plus strand and other proteins that are expressed from the complementary minus strand (ambisense genomes of arenaviruses and bunyaviruses). Individual genes of some 46 P.E. PELLETT ET AL. viruses are encoded on independent genome molecules that are analogous to independent chromosomes (segmented genomes of orthomyxoviruses). Protein coding genes of viruses come in several forms. For some, a single large open reading frame (ORF) is translated into a large polyprotein that is subsequently proteolytically processed into multiple independent proteins. For many others, multiple ORFs are translated into individual proteins. Many viruses express non-coding RNAs, such as microRNAs. In addition to the sequences involved in producing trans-acting products such as proteins and non-coding RNAs, virus genomes have regions that serve as signals for, and play structural roles in, virus replication and packaging into capsids.",

Other enveloped viruses, e.g., influenza viruses, are endocytosed and ultimately fuse their envelopes with the endocytic vesicle membrane. In both mechanisms, a conformational change in a viral membrane protein exposes a hydrophobic fusion peptide that triggers membrane fusion, releasing the virus nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm (Plemper, 2011) . Penetration mechanisms of non-enveloped viruses are less well understood than for enveloped viruses. Interaction of non-enveloped viruses with the cell surface or endocytic vesicles leads to conformational changes that expose a hydrophobic domain or other membrane-destabilizing structure. In a number of instances, triggering the conformational changes involved in penetration requires a cellular coreceptor or a change in virion environment, such as acidification of an endocytic compartment. Further changes to the virion must take place to allow the virus genome to access cellular components necessary for viral replication. Details of this uncoating process depend on virus type and replication strategy and the compartment within the cell where virus genome replication occurs. For most DNA viruses (Baltimore classes I and II, poxviruses excepted; see Fig. 2 .3, below), the genome-containing capsid or nucleoprotein complex is transported to the vicinity of a nuclear pore, followed by delivery of the genome through the pore to allow initiation of gene expression and replication. For positive-strand RNA viruses (Baltimore class IV), dissociation of the genomic RNA from the capsid allows it to associate with ribosomes, beginning viral gene expression. For double-stranded and negative-strand RNA viruses (Baltimore classes III and V), uncoating typically removes the outer components of the virion but leaves the genome associated with the virus-encoded RdRp.",

The smaller DNA viruses utilize cellular enzymes for this process while viruses with larger genomes encode their own DNA replication enzymes.

Class IV (ssRNA \u00fe) viruses have genomes that can function as mRNAs and are translated directly into a polyprotein upon uncoating of the virus genome. Autocatalytic cleavage of the polyprotein releases the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which then transcribes the full-length complementary RNA copies of the genome (antigenomes) that are used as templates for synthesis of progeny genomes (Fig. 2.4) . Although single-stranded, the genomes of class V (ssRNA-) viruses cannot be translated directly upon uncoating because the genome is antisense to the protein coding region.

Depending on cell type, entry can be via direct fusion of the virion envelope with the plasma membrane or by an endocytic route ( Fig. 2. 2, paths A1 and A2). After transport of the capsid to nuclear pores and injection of the genome into the nucleus, virus genes are transcribed in several phases by host RNA polymerase II. Immediate early-phase genes adapt the cell for virus replication, early genes carry out viral DNA replication, and late genes encode viral structural proteins as well as For some viruses, capsids are formed in the nucleus and, for others, capsids are formed in the cytoplasm. Some nuclear replicated genomes are transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm for packaging into capsids that assemble in the cytoplasm (1A and 2B), joining the egress pathway of virions whose genomes and capsids are produced in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmically replicated genomes are packaged into cytoplasmically assembled capsids (A and B). These filled capsids can then make their way out of the cell via cell lysis (C1), acquisition of and envelope during budding from the plasma membrane (C2), or by budding into a cytoplasmic vesicle that ultimately fuses with the plasma membrane and releases the enveloped virion (C3, 6, and 7). For some viruses with nuclear replicated genomes that fill nuclear assembled capsids (2A), virions can make their way out of the cell after cell lysis (3A). Filled herpesvirus capsids acquire an envelope during budding into the lumen of the nuclear membrane. This envelope fuses with the outer nuclear membrane, releasing a naked capsid into the cytoplasm (3B and 4).

After replication in the respiratory tract and lymphoid organs, viremic transmission to the skin results in characteristic vesicular lesions. Central nervous system (CNS) complications of varicella are infrequent (1-3 occurrences per 10 000 cases), with encephalitis and cerebellar ataxia being most frequent. Transverse myelitis, meningitis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome have also been reported (Hung et al., 2012) . VZV enters nerve cells innervating infected areas and establishes latency in dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia . Decades after primary infection, VZV may reactivate to cause zoster (shingles). The rash is often preceded by a prodromal \"pins-and-needles\" sensation and by non-specific symptoms such as fever and headache. Although the duration of the rash is typically 2-4 weeks, some patients suffer from postherpetic neuralgia that may last for months or years. VZV reactivation is sometimes associated with Bell's palsy-like symptoms (Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2). CNS complications of VZV reactivation include encephalitis with extensive lymphocyte infiltration and vasculitis, as well as transverse myelitis.",

The human rotavirus genome has 11 segments with a total of approximately 19 000 bp (Taniguchi and Komoto, 2012) . Reovirus virions bind to cell surface sialic acid, but additional interaction with cell surface receptors is thought to be necessary for infection (Danthi et al., 2010) . Replication occurs in the cytoplasm. After entry, partial uncoating occurs, allowing the virion-associated RNA polymerase to transcribe the genome (McDonald et al., 2009) . Positive-sense transcripts act as both mRNAs and as templates for negative-strand synthesis, which occurs during assembly of progeny virions (Trask et al., 2012) . Release occurs by lysis but is inefficient (Fig. 2.5, path C1 ).",

Primary infection in adults is more likely to involve fever, malaise, lymphadenopathy, upper respiratory symptoms and, in women, joint pain. Of greatest concern is primary rubella infection in women, particularly during the first 12-16 weeks of pregnancy. There is high likelihood of transplacental transmission and development of congenital rubella syndrome (Duszak, 2009 ). This syndrome gives rise to multiple, severe congenital abnormalities with high frequency. These include cataracts and retinopathies, heart defects, and neurologic deficits, including mental retardation, psychomotor deficits, and deficits in language and speech. The rubella vaccine, now one component of the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine, has greatly reduced the incidence of both primary rubella and congenital rubella syndrome in developed countries.

Only a limited number of these (HA1, HA2, and HA3, as well as NA1 and NA2) are found in human influenza A viruses, although all are found in animal influenza viruses. Although humans are generally not good hosts for animal influenza A viruses, certain species, e.g., pigs, can be infected with human and animal influenza A viruses. Coinfection with multiple influenza viruses can, through genetic reassortment of genome segments, give rise to novel viruses able to replicate in humans and having HA and/or NA glycoproteins against which there is little or no pre-existing immunity in the human population. This is known as antigenic shift. Such reassortant viruses can give rise to influenza pandemics, as occurred in 2009. A pandemic might also result if an animal influenza A virus, such as a highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus, adapted to human hosts directly by mutation. The currently circulating human influenza A viruses continuously change the antigenicity of their HA and NA glycoproteins by mutation, a phenomenon known as antigenic drift. This necessitates annual modification of the influenza vaccine. Antigenic variants of influenza B and C viruses are known but these viruses have little or no pandemic potential.",

In uncomplicated influenza, a short incubation period (1-5 days) is typically followed by a disease course that includes chills, headache, and dry cough, followed by fever, myalgia, and other symptoms that persist for 3-8 days (longer in the elderly). More severe cases result from replication of the virus in the lower respiratory tract and lungs (pneumonia). Replication of human influenza A virus outside the respiratory tract appears to be limited. This is due to requirement for cleavage of HA by tryptase Clara, which is secreted by Clara cells in the ciliated epithelium of the airway. However, highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses contain polybasic HA cleavage sites, enabling cleavage by more widely expressed proteases, allowing these viruses to spread systemically. Despite having limited ability to replicate outside the respiratory tract, the neurologic complications of human influenza virus infections include encephalopathy (Reye's syndrome and acute necrotizing encephalopathy), encephalitis, stroke, and myelitis.

Secondary replication of measles virus occurs in lymphoid and endothelial cells and can involve many tissues. Clinical symptoms proceed from fever, to cough and conjunctivitis, and then to Koplik's spots on the oral mucosa and a generalized rash that persists for about a week. Beginning at rash onset, T-cell and monocyte responses are markedly suppressed for several weeks, leading to susceptibility to other infections. Cellular immunity is essential for recovery from measles (Griffin et al., 2012) . Although antibodies can contribute to recovery from measles, they are not essential. Measles virus infections can lead to three neurologic diseases. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is a transient autoimmune demyelinating disease that occurs about a week after the rash phase in 0.1% of cases. Measles inclusion body encephalitis is a rare progressive disease that occurs predominantly in immune-suppressed individuals. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis occurs in 1 of 10 4 -10 5 cases and involves a persistent infection of the brain that can progress for years (Tatli et al., 2012) .",

Virus entry occurs either through the mucosa of the respiratory, gastrointestinal tract, or urogenital tract, by transcutaneous inoculation into the blood stream through blood transfusion or insect vector bites, and by maternalfetal transmission across the placenta. Virus replication usually occurs at the portal of entry and can cause disease there; for example, influenza virus and respiratory disease, and rotaviruses and gastrointestinal disease. Some viruses produce diseases at sites distant from their portal of entry. The mechanism of spread varies; viruses may reach their target cells via nerves or through the blood stream or lymphatics. Viruses also have affinity for certain organ and cell types. Such cell tropism is usually mediated by specific cell surface receptors on the host cell with which the virus envelope or capsid can interact to initiate infection. Viruses produce cellular injury by either direct destruction of the infected cell or by alteration in cell physiology. Inactivation of host cellular protein synthesis is a hallmark of many virus infections. Cellular damage may ultimately result in clinical illness, though this depends on several factors, including the host immune response to viral infection.",

In immune-competent individuals, most virus infections are self-limiting and recovery is associated with clearance (elimination) of the virus. The innate immune response is a local, antigen-independent defense mechanism that detects unique structural molecules present in microbes called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are recognized by membrane-associated or cytosolic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present in most body defense cells. Viral PAMPs like DNA, ssRNA, and dsRNA are recognized by three classes of PRPs: the Toll-like receptors, retinoic acid-inducible gene-like receptors, and nucleotide oligomerization domain-like receptors (Takeuchi and Akira, 2009 ). Recognition of viral nucleic acids by PRRs activates signaling pathways, resulting in production of type 1 interferons (IFNs). Further upregulation of IFN-induced gene products helps in the suppression of viral replication and confers resistance to infection for uninfected cells.",

Currently available antivirals target viral replication enzymes, proteases, and entry and exit pathways. Entry of HIV into host cell can be blocked by enfuvirtide (which binds to gp41 on the surface of HIV virion) and maraviroc (which blocks binding of HIV to CCR-5). Amantadine and rimantadine inhibit uncoating of influenza A virus by inhibiting the ion channel function of the membrane protein M 2 . A number of antivirals inhibit nucleic acid synthesis, targeting viral DNA and RNA polymerases. Inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase can be achieved by both nucleoside (e.g., zidovudine) and non-nucleoside (e.g., efavirenz) inhibitors. Drugs that inhibit viral proteases are currently in clinical practice against HIV (e.g., atazanavir) and hepatitis C virus (e.g., telaprevir). Specific inhibitors of enzymes necessary for hepatitis C virus replication are currently under development. In addition to the NS3/4A serine protease inhibitors (e.g., boceprevir), studies with NS5B RNAdependent RNA polymerase inhibitors (e.g., filibuvir), NS5A inhibitors (e.g., BMS-790052), and cyclophilin inhibitors (e.g., alisporivir) are currently under way.

Enveloped virions interact with a cell surface receptor (A), and either enter by membrane fusion at the plasma membrane (A1) or by uptake of the virion into an endocytic vesicle (A2 to B2), followed by fusion of the virion envelope with the vesicle membrane (B3), releasing the capsid into the cytoplasm.
