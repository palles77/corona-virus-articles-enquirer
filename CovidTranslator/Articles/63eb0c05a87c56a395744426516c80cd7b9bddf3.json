Genomic sequencing has revealed the much-awaited blueprint of most pathogens. Screening blood for the nucleic acids of infectious agents has blunted the spread of pathogens by transfusion, the field of antiviral therapeutics has exploded and technologies for the development of novel and safer vaccines have become available. The quantum jump in our ability to detect, prevent and treat infectious diseases resulting from improved technologies and genomics was moderated during this period by the greatest emergence of new infectious agents ever recorded and a worrisome increase in resistance to existing therapies. Dozens of new infectious diseases are expected to emerge in the coming decades. Controlling these diseases will require a better understanding of the worldwide threat and economic burden of infectious diseases and a global agenda.",

Textbooks document the plague of Athens described by Thucydides in the fifth century BC, the European bubonic plague of 1347 that killed one-third of the human population and represents the largest epidemic ever recorded, and measles and smallpox viruses that were introduced to the American continent by Hern\u00e1n Cortes, which contributed to the disappearance of the Aztec civilization. Thousands of other examples can be found in the records, accounting for hundreds of millions of deaths, changes in the course of history and selective expansion of genetic diseases such as the thalassemias, in which the defective hemoglobins provided increased resistance to endemic malaria 1 . In the twentieth century, clean water, vaccination and antimicrobial therapies brought most infectious diseases under control, marking one of the greatest achievements of civilization. At the end of the century, however, infectious agents started to retaliate and we have seen the emergence of pathogens that are resistant to antimicrobials and of new pathogens that had not been previously detected in humans. This review will focus on the major changes in infectious diseases and the scientific progress in the field during the last decade.",

Global elimination of bacterial meningitis may now be an achievable target when vaccines against meningococcus ACYW and B become available within the next decade. Significant progress during this period was also achieved for the control of HCV and HIV in developed countries. In 1987, the cloning of the hepatitis C genome 7 enabled the development of diagnostic methods to test blood and blood derivatives, which in the early 1990s resulted in the reduction of new HCV cases from >130,000 per year to 25,000 per year in the United States alone (Fig. 1) , while the introduction of a cocktail of drugs (highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART) as a standard of care for people with HIV 8 transformed HIV in the Western world from a deadly disease into a manageable chronic disease. It is also worth mentioning that diphtheria 9 and cholera 10 , two diseases that had re-emerged at the beginning of the 1990s have been controlled during this period (Fig. 1) .",

These include avian influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), West Nile, Ebola and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). The last decade also saw an increase in the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and the re-emergence of previously eradicated pathogens as agents of bioterror (Fig. 1) . Avian influenza was reported to infect humans seven times during the H I S TO R I C A L P E R S P E C T I V E last seven years-the last outbreak before this period was in 1968. The virus first reappeared in Hong Kong in 1997 as an H5N1 strain, infecting 18 humans and causing 6 deaths. Two years later, again in Hong Kong, a new avian virus, H9N2, infected two people: the same virus strain caused three infections and one death in 2003. In 2004, we witnessed an explosion of new cases, with 43 cases and 31 deaths reported in a series of independent outbreaks in Thailand and Vietnam. So far, the outbreaks have been controlled by culling more than 100 million fowl 11 , but the multiple, independent outbreaks of the last two years suggest the proximity of a new flu pandemic 12, 13 . The last decade also saw the emergence of other new diseases caused by transmission of pathogens from animals to humans. The SARS coronavirus, which in the short period between February and July 2003 infected 8,098 people and caused 774 deaths 14 (Fig. 1) , was likely to have been transmitted by increased contact between humans and virus-carrying wild animals that are sold for food in Asian markets 14 . Although the SARS outbreak was quickly resolved, it generated widespread panic, paralyzed travel and threatened the global economy.",

The disease was transmitted to humans through consumption of the meat of cows infected by the bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE) prion. West Nile virus, a flavivirus described for the first time in 1937 in Africa and endemic in Europe and central Asia, was reported for the first time in New York in 1999. Most likely air travel was responsible for the virus crossing continents. The virus infects birds and is transmitted from birds to mammals by the urban mosquito Culex pipiens-within four years the virus spread across most of the Unites States, infecting 9,862 people and causing 264 deaths in 2003 (Fig. 1) .",

In less than a decade, genomics has provided the blueprints of microorganisms and the ability to explore, in a culture-independent manner, the global diversity of living organisms. Today, the availability in public databases of more than 190 bacterial genomes, 1,600 viral genomes and the malaria parasite sequence is incredible progress, considering that fewer than ten years ago microbiologists spent most of their research efforts in cloning and sequencing one gene at a time. In addition to providing information about every gene of known pathogens, genome sequencing facilitated research on 'old' infectious agents difficult or impossible to grow in vitro, such as HCV or the bacillus causing Whipple disease 22, 23 . For instance, HCV, which cannot be grown in vitro and has never been seen by electron microscopy, is impossible to study using the basic technologies of conventional microbiology. But the cloning of the genome in 1987 (ref. 7) allowed the development of diagnostic methods to test blood and blood derivatives, which in the early 1990s virtually eliminated new transmissions of HCV by transfusion (Fig. 1) . In addition, the genomic sequence provided information on the proteins needed to make the virus, allowing the expression of recombinant viral proteins that have been used to develop prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines or to test antiviral compounds that are now in clinical trials 24 .",

This is such a novel approach to microbial pathogenesis that a new discipline, 'cellular microbiology' 29 , has been created to differentiate modern microbiology, which studies pathogens interacting with their hosts in their native environments, from classical microbiology, which studies pathogens grown in rich media under artificial conditions in the laboratory. These new approaches have contributed to the discovery of virulence factors not necessary to pathogens grown in the laboratory but essential or preferentially expressed only in vivo during infection.

These principles provided the killed, live attenuated and subunit vaccines in use today (Fig. 2) and are responsible for a large part of the control of infectious diseases achieved to date. But Pasteur's principles did not allow the development of vaccines against those microorganisms that cannot be cultivated in vitro such as HCV, papillomavirus types 16 and 18 and M. leprae. Also, the principles of Pasteur did not provide vaccines for antigenically hypervariable microorganisms such as serogroup B meningococcus, gonococcus, malaria and HIV, and did not teach how to induce cytotoxic T cells, which kill infected host cells and therefore contribute to the control of viral replication. During the last decade, we have overcome most of these technical limitations, even if we are still unable to use them effectively enough to solve challenges such as HIV. The availability of genomes allowed the identification of novel vaccine candidates without the need to cultivate microorganisms, a process named 'reverse vaccinology' 35 . In this approach, the genomic sequences of viral, bacterial or parasitic pathogens are used to select by computer analysis, microarrays, proteomics and other genome-based systematic approaches those antigens that are likely to confer protective immunity and eliminate potentially dangerous antigens, such as those showing homology to human proteins, which are therefore potentially able to induce autoimmunity. The predicted antigens are then expressed by recombinant DNA and tested in an animal model. This genome-based vaccine approach allowed the development of vaccines against HCV and human papillomavirus 16 and 18, which, being unable to grow in vitro, were not approachable following the principles of Pasteur. But once the genome sequence became available, it was used to predict the antigens coding for the surface proteins (E1 and E2 for HCV and VP L1 for papillomavirus), express them and develop vaccines that are presently in phase 1 and 3 clinical trials, respectively 24, 36 .",

In this case, the sequence of the bacterial genome allowed the computer prediction of approximately 600 novel vaccine candidates, 350 of which were expressed in Escherichia coli and tested for their ability to elicit protective immunity. Remarkably, the approach identified 29 novel protective antigens, some of which are conserved in all meningococcal strains and are now being tested in clinical trials. The meningococcus B example has been followed for many other bacterial pathogens, including pneumococcus, group B streptococcus and chlamydia 37 .",

This represents one of the most intriguing developments that we expect in the next decade. Among the early results in this new area is the development of adjuvants based on unmethylated CpG motifs, which, being prevalent in bacterial but not in vertebrate genomic DNA, are seen as the signature of bacterial infection by the innate immune system. Synthetic CpG-containing oligonucleotides have been shown to stimulate Toll-like receptor 9 and to induce T H 1-like proinflammatory cytokines and to be effective adjuvants for many vaccines in animal models and in some preliminary clinical trials 43 . Figure 2 provides an example of what we predict will happen in the field of vaccines during the next decades. Reverse vaccinology, DNA vaccination, nonreplicating vectors, the understanding of the innate immune system and the development of new, rationally designed adjuvants for mucosal and systemic delivery of vaccines are likely to be useful in driving the development of many novel vaccines to prevent and treat infectious diseases.",

At the beginning of the 1990s, HIV was growing in the US and worldwide. In the US, 49,000 new HIV cases and 31,000 deaths were recorded in 1990, growing to 72,000 and 50,000, respectively, in 1994 (Fig. 1) . Worldwide, there were 8 million cases in 1990 and 18 million in 1994 (Fig. 1) . The first effective therapy for HIV came in 1992 with the approval of the first combination of reverse transcriptase inhibitors, 3\u2032-azido-2',3\u2032-dideoxythymidine (AZT) and 2',3\u2032-dideoxycytidine (ddC), which prevent viral DNA synthesis by acting as chain terminators. The approval of (-)-B-L-3\u2032-thia-2'-3\u2032-dideoxycytidine (3TC), a safer inhibitor of reverse transcriptase in 1993 and of the first protease inhibitor in 1995, together with the ability to use the polymerase chain reaction to measure the amount of virus present in a given volume of blood (viral load), allowed the introduction of a cocktail of drugs as a standard of care for people with HIV 8 . HAART increased life expectancy and transformed HIV in the Western world from a deadly disease into a more manageable chronic disease, which postpones, but unfortunately does not solve, the HIV problem. New infections and deaths from HIV started to plateau and decrease for the first time in the mid-1990s. Today in the United States there are approximately 30,000 new cases and 15,000 deaths per year. But the number of people living with HIV has increased dramatically, from 30,000 in 1992 to more than 400,000 ( Fig. 1 and Box 1) , and currently we have no longterm solution for them. The management of the population now chronically infected by HIV provides new challenges, such as the continuous development of new antivirals active against the resistant HIV isolates selected by the present therapy and the control of side effects resulting from chronic treatment.",

The availability of validated target enzymes used for high-throughput screening of natural and combinatorial libraries is today complemented by the ability to cocrystalize target proteins and their inhibitors, allowing the use of structure-based drug design for the generation and optimization of more and better leads. Recently, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral entry into host cells has allowed the development of a new class of antiviral compounds, known as fusion inhibitors, one of which (enfuvirtide) is already in use for the therapy of AIDS 46 . Enfurvitide is a synthetic peptide which binds to a region of the HIV-1 envelope and prevents a conformational change necessary to drive the fusion of the viral membrane with that of the host cell. Very effective in vitro, although not yet clinically relevant, are the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides that use a cell-defense enzyme pathway to drive the selective degradation of viral RNA products 47 . siRNAs have been shown to be effective in vitro against virtually all medically important viruses, including HIV and HCV; however, their development as drugs needs to meet the challenge of delivering effectively large and unstable molecules such as oligonucleotides to infected tissues. In conclusion, whereas antibiotics were the hot drugs of the past century, antivirals will be the hot drugs of the twenty-first century during which time we expect to have effective drugs against most viral infections.",

But animal sera have largely disappeared from the anti-infection toolbox during the last 20 years, mostly because of the toxic reactions (serum sickness) caused by injecting humans with horse sera, while the decreased popularity of blood derivatives has reduced the use of human gammaglobulins to only a few applications such as cytomegalovirus and parvovirus B19.

These new technologies allowed a timely response to the emergence of new pathogens, as in the case of SARS, or the development of assays to monitor and control the spread of infectious agents. The virtual elimination of serious infections transmitted by blood transfusion 51 , which is one of the milestones in the history of medicine that has been achieved during the last decade, was made possible by these technologies (Fig. 4) . In the early 1980s the risk of being infected by HIV or HCV by blood transfusion was in the range of 1 \u00d7 10 -2 . The introduction of screening for antibodies against HIV in 1984 and for HCV in 1990 tremendously increased the safety of blood and blood products reducing the risk to less than 1 \u00d7 10 -5 . Finally, the introduction of nucleic acid testing in 1999 allowed the detection of those recently infected donors that had not had the time yet to develop antibodies, reducing the risk for both to one in two million 52 . Encouraged by the dramatic success of testing blood for HIV and HCV, new assays have been recently introduced to test blood for hepatitis B and West Nile viruses, virtually eliminating most common diseases that can be transmitted by blood transfusion. Similar technologies can be applied to the detection of other infectious agents such as parvovirus, malaria, leishmania, vCJD, pathogenic bacteria or agents spread by bioterrorists.",

The shotgun sequencing of microorganisms captured by filtering hundreds of liters of water of the Sargasso sea, which identified 1.2 million new genes, 1,800 species and 148 novel bacterial phylotypes 53 , showed that microbial diversity is orders of magnitude larger than had been previously estimated.

Fortunately, today's technologies can provide adequate tools to detect, manage, control and prevent emerging infections. But, technologies are not sufficient on their own to contain the impact of infectious diseases and we are likely to fail unless all governments increase the priority of infectious diseases in the political agenda and promote a coordinated, collaborative global action against them, both in developed and developing countries. A list of measures necessary for the global control of infectious diseases include increased global priority, global legislation and collaboration, coordination of regulatory agencies, development of vaccines to prevent all diseases and a sustainable economic system to support these initiatives (Box 2). An example showing how effective a global approach can be is represented by the campaign for eradication of poliomyelitis, which is the largest public health initiative ever tried. Launched in 1985 for South America, it was taken up by the World Assembly, the governing body of the World Health Organization, which in 1988 committed to the global eradication of poliovirus by the year 2000. During the period from 1998 to 2002, more than two billion children were immunized using the national immunization days and a budget of approximately four billion 56 . Progress towards eradication of the virus was fast. In 1988 125 countries in 5 continents reported endemic poliovirus. By 1994, 2000 and 2002 the American continent, the Western Pacific Region and the European regions, respectively, were certified polio free (three years without a case of polio). In 2003 only six polio-endemic countries were reported (Niger, Nigeria, and Egypt in Africa and India, Afghanistan and Pakistan in Asia). During the same period, cases were reduced by 99.9% from 350,000/year to less than 800 (Fig. 1) . Unfortunately, in 2004 the virus was imported from these countries to eight African countries that were previously polio free 2 . Although the polio eradication missed the deadline of the year 2000 and has seen a setback in 2004, the initiative is one of the best examples of how a global effort can, within a short period of time, reduce the incidence of an infectious disease by more than 99.9%. The final effort in the remaining endemic regions will eliminate the disease from the world within the next few years and leave us with the problem of whether and how long we should continue to vaccinate against a disease that no longer exists. Hopefully, the success against polio will be a catalyst to trigger similar global priority and collaboration against all infectious diseases.",
