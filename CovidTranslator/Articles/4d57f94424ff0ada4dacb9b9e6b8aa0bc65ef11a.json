            "text": "Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are among the most common and important problems in clinical medicine. In developed countries, acute respiratory infections (ARI) account for the majority of antibiotic prescriptions written, 20% of all medical consultations and over 30% of lost days from work [1] . The situation is even more dramatic in developing countries where nearly 20% of mortality in children under the age of 5 years can be attributed to ARI [2] . When a patient is thought to have a respiratory infection, considering the disease features in a sequential manner can help focus the differential diagnosis and expedite specific diagnosis and treatment. The starting point is a basic understanding of the pathophysiology of the respiratory tract and ways in which innate and acquired immune systems interact with microbial pathogens. The physician then defines the clinical syndrome being evaluated, the medical characteristics of the affected patient and context in which the infection was contracted. This information guides laboratory testing, imaging and acquisition of other ancillary data needed to arrive at a final diagnosis and treatment plan. This chapter provides an overview of key concepts related to RTIs, with an emphasis on clinical and microbiological aspects.",

            "text": "In common with other infectious diseases, the outcome of RTIs is a complex interplay between the ability of the pathogen to infect, colonize and damage tissues and the capacity of the host to mount an effective immune response. The primary function of the respiratory tract is gas exchange between inspired air and circulating blood. The average human inhales approximately 28 000 breaths of air each day along with any contaminating bacteria, virus and fungal particles present as aerosols in the environment. Also, inadvertent microaspiration of oropharyngeal and/or gastric contents occurs not infrequently in normal hosts and is extremely common in critically ill, mechanically ventilated patients [3] . Despite these challenges, the lungs, bronchi and trachea below the larynx remain essentially sterile in normal individuals. Fortunately, the respiratory tract has evolved to withstand this onslaught of potential pathogens by a variety of innate and acquired immune defences. For example, infectious particles larger than 8\u00c010 microns are efficiently trapped in a mucociliary blanket lining the nares, trachea and bronchi. A large amount of mucus is produced by goblet cells present in ciliated columnar epithelium; once an organism is trapped in this viscous layer, directional ciliary action transports it to the back of the throat where it can be swallowed or expectorated. Mechanical clearance is also facilitated by the normal flow of saliva, sloughing and regeneration of respiratory epithelial cells, and, for the oropharynx, competition between resident normal flora and invading pathogens. Importantly, the respiratory mucosa is the site of production of large amounts of IgA (10\u00c015% of total protein in nasal secretions), which has both antibacterial and antiviral activity. Immunoglobulins G and M, along with complement are present in respiratory secretions through transudation from the blood, and serve to opsonize, agglutinate and neutralize pathogenic organisms, similar to their role in blood and other sites. Additionally, the surface liquid of the airways contains a wide variety of proteins and peptides with antimicrobial properties. These include lactoferrin, lysozyme, cathelicidins, secretory leukocyte proteinase inhibitor and beta-defensins. Betadefensins are an important family of cationic antimicrobial peptides which greatly enhance the resistance of epithelial surfaces to microbial colonization. They interact with the negatively charged membranes of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi and enveloped viruses by displacing Ca 21 and Mg 21 ions, thus altering the integrity of microbial membranes. Additionally, defensins are chemokines which attract macrophages, dendritic cells and other immune cells to the site of infection, thus serving a dual role in both the innate and acquired immune systems [4, 5] .",

Although there is no mucociliary function at this level, other cellmediated and humoral host defences are present to make up for this deficit. For example, components of surfactant (a phospholipoprotein complex secreted by type II pneumocytes) have several important immune functions. SP-A and SP-D bind sugars on the surface of pathogens and opsonize them for enhanced uptake by phagocytes. They also interact with the adaptive immune response to enhance clearance of pathogens by alveolar macrophages and neutrophils [6] . Free fatty acids and various ironbinding proteins also act within the alveoli and terminal bronchioles as microbiocidal compounds.",

Acquired damage to the mucociliary apparatus is extremely common and can result from a wide variety of insults to the respiratory tract. The effects of alcohol have been studied extensively and the damage to host defences occurs at multiple levels. In addition to suppressing cough and epiglottic reflexes, consumption of alcohol has been associated with increased colonization of the oropharynx with Gram-negative bacilli. It also impairs cellular immune responses to infection by decreasing recruitment and mobilization of neutrophils to the lung, blocking the TNF response to endotoxin, and increasing production of IL-10, a cytokine with antiinflammatory properties [9, 10] .

Most of these conditions can exist in acute and chronic forms. Acute disease is usually caused by viral or bacterial infections, and chronic disease is usually caused by fungi, slow-growing bacteria such as mycobacteria, bacteria adapted to persist in biofilms and occasional less common pathogens such as parasites.

The middle ears, mastoid cavities, and sinuses are connected to the nasopharynx and the pathogenesis of otitis media often relates to obstruction of the eustachian tube, resulting in fluid retention and suppuration. Bacterial biofilm formation may be important in the pathogenesis of chronic infections [12] . Clinical manifestations typically include otalgia (ear pain) and decreased hearing \u00c0 the presence of fever is variable. Many patients with otitis media experience a viral upper respiratory tract infection or exacerbation of allergic rhinitis in the days or week before onset of symptoms. Diagnosis is based on clinical history and examination of the tympanic membrane. The tympanic membrane is normally translucent but becomes cloudy or opaque in response to infection. Studies have documented the microbiology of acute otitis media based on needle aspiration and culture of middle ear fluid. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae predominate, while Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Moraxella catarrhalis are less frequently isolated [13, 14] . It is interesting that of the many known serotypes of S. pneumoniae, a relatively small number account for the majority of cases, and some regional differences in predominant serotypes have been noted [15] . Respiratory viruses can be isolated from nearly half of all children with acute otitis media.

Fever, severe pain behind the ear that worsens at night and persistent otorrhoea beyond 3 weeks' duration are signs and symptoms of developing mastoiditis. Because acute mastoiditis is an extension of an ongoing otitis media, the microbiological features are very similar with S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and S. pyogenes being the most commonly isolated pathogens [17] . An important epidemiologic observation has been the increasing frequency with which multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae is being isolated. Approximately 40\u00c050% of isolates are resistant to penicillin, 30\u00c035% are resistant to macrolides, and 25% resistant to ceftriaxone [18] . S. aureus, including meticillin-resistant strains have become increasingly important as a cause of mastoiditis since the routine use of pneumococcal vaccination. Chronic mastoiditis commonly occurs in the background of chronic suppurative otitis media and cholesteatoma formation. The most frequently isolated organisms include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enteric Gram-negative bacilli, S. aureus, and a variety of anaerobic bacteria. Polymicrobial infections are common.",

In most cases simple colonization of the sinuses is of little or no clinical significance. Patients most at risk of developing symptomatic disease include those with impaired sinus drainage from chronic inflammatory conditions, nasal polyps or structural abnormalities of the nasal septum or sinus ostia. Many species of fungus have been reported as colonizers of the sinuses, with Aspergillus spp. being among the most common. In the setting of poor sinus drainage, fungal hyphae can grow as dense intertwined collections referred to as 'fungus balls'. As the size of the ball increases there can be erosion of the wall of the sinus due to mass effect and surgical excision is needed to remove the fungus ball and relieve the obstruction [24] . Of greater clinical concern is fungal sinusitis occurring in the context of immune suppression. In these instances the infection is much more aggressive with invasion of the fungus into the sinus mucosa, and underlying bone and vascular structures. The tempo of disease is generally dependent on the level of immune suppression; the most profoundly immune-compromised patients experience acute disease with rapid progression of symptoms over several days, while patients with a more intact immune function show a more chronic course over several weeks or months. Epidemiologically, invasive fungal sinusitis has risen in parallel with the increased number of patients receiving bone marrow transplants, chemotherapy and solid organ transplants. Diabetic ketoacidosis and highdose glucocorticoid therapy are also significant risk factors for the development of invasive fungal sinusitis, especially due to Rhizopus and other zygomycetes. Although cultures are useful in determining the aetiologic agent of infection and helping to guide antifungal therapy, biopsy is often necessary to document whether invasive infection is present rather than colonization of the sinus cavity [25] .",

Some patients have fever along with other constitutional signs and symptoms such as headache, malaise and swollen cervical lymph nodes. The clinical syndrome of pharyngitis is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical care, accounting for over 12 million outpatient visits each year in the US [26] . Non-infectious causes include seasonal allergies, exposure to smoke and other pollutants and poorly humidified air. Infectious causes include a wide variety of viral and bacterial pathogens. Essentially all of the respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, etc.) cause pharyngitis as well as herpes simplex virus, Epstein\u00c0Barr virus and human immunodeficiency virus [27] . Bacterial pharyngitis due to group A streptococcus (GAS) presents as the sudden onset of sore throat, tonsillar swelling, fever and cervical lymphadenitis. It is important to treat GAS pharyngitis in order to prevent suppurative and non-suppurative complications such as sinusitis, retropharyngeal abscesses, rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis [28] . Other beta-haemolytic streptococci (e.g. groups C and G) are not typically associated with the development of rheumatic fever and the role of antimicrobial therapy is less certain. Less common bacteria associated with pharyngitis include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphtheriae [29] .",

Patients with bronchitis present with cough and sputum production but usually lack fever, tachycardia and tachypnoea. Acute bronchitis can be differentiated from chronic bronchitis based on the duration of symptoms. For example, chronic bronchitis in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is characterized by a cough lasting at least 3 months in each of two successive years. Viral infections are the most common cause of acute bronchitis with influenza A and B, parainfluenza, RSV, rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus being isolated most frequently [30] . It is especially important to recognize influenza infections because of the relatively higher morbidity and because specific antiviral therapy is available. It is controversial whether or not bacterial organisms commonly associated with pneumonia in adults (e.g. S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, etc.) can cause isolated acute bacterial bronchitis. However, three other organisms, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and Bordetella pertussis (the agent of whooping cough), have been shown to cause acute bacterial bronchitis. Treatment of pertussis is indicated to reduce both the duration of symptoms and transmissibility of infection.",

It is a complex disorder that differs significantly between paediatric and adult populations. Most children that are affected are younger than 2 years old and have had common cold symptoms for several days. The disease progresses to involve the lower airways, resulting in persistent cough, wheezing and rapid breathing. Infants and young children are at increased risk of developing laboured breathing resulting in cyanosis and apnoeic episodes requiring hospitalization. The disease can also be especially severe in children with underlying pulmonary or cardiac disease. The cause of bronchiolitis is usually viral with RSV being the most common aetiology. RSV infections occur in epidemics which peak in January and February in the northern hemisphere and in June and July in the southern hemisphere [31] . Although infectious bronchiolitis can occur in adults, it is rare compared to what is seen in children. RSV, adenovirus and M. pneumoniae have been reported as infectious aetiologies. More often it arises from inhalation injury from toxic fumes, drug ingestion or is idiopathic with no identifiable precipitating cause [32] .",

Illness is often heralded by a sudden onset of fever and chills associated with chest pain, cough and production of purulent sputum. Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, anorexia, sweats and nausea are common. On physical examination patients are often febrile, tachypnoeic and tachycardic, although this can vary greatly depending on the age of the patient and other factors. Clinical evidence of pulmonary consolidation can be confirmed by radiographic imaging (Fig. 84.2) . The white blood cell count is often elevated in the range of 15 000\u00c035 000/mm 3 , when leukopenia is present it is a poor prognostic sign. Haematocrit and haemoglobin values are usually normal. Microscopic examination of sputum by Gram stain reveals numerous neutrophils and bacteria. When a single bacterial morphology predominates it can be helpful in establishing a diagnosis. However, caution should be applied because colonizing organisms can be present in large numbers and contaminating oral flora can confuse interpretation. Blood cultures are positive in a minority of cases of CAP but can be very useful in establishing the aetiologic agent. It is important to recognize that even with extensive evaluation, microbiologic diagnosis can only be made in 25\u00c070% of cases [33] .",

Nonetheless, most studies show that pneumococcus accounts for the majority (50\u00c070%) of cases of CAP [33, 34] . Co-morbidities that put patients at risk for severe pneumococcal disease include surgical or functional asplenia and immunoglobulin deficiencies. H. influenzae causes pneumonia with features similar to pneumococcus, but is less frequent, accounting for 3\u00c038% of cases. Overall, S. aureus has traditionally been associated with CAP in a small percentage of cases. However, it has increased significance in the elderly and as a co-infection in patients with influenza virus. In the last decade there has been increasing concern about the global spread of CA-MRSA strains. Although they are most often associated with skin and soft tissue infections, when CA-MRSA pneumonia does occur it can be quite severe and is associated with a high mortality rate [35, 36] . Pneumonia due to enteric Gram-negative bacilli, such as Klebsiella, Pseudomonas and Enterobacter, occur in the elderly and debilitated patients with alcoholism, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. They should be especially considered in patients who have been recently hospitalized. Atypical pneumonia is a somewhat confusing term, but generally refers to CAP due to less common agents such as Legionella, Chlamydophila or Mycoplasma. The incidence of Legionella infection seems to vary greatly based on geographic location. Mycoplasma tends to infect younger individuals and has occurred as epidemics in enclosed populations such as colleges and military bases [37] . Viral infections are an important cause of CAP, especially in the young and the elderly but can be difficult to distinguish clinically from bacterial pneumonia. Recent studies aided by the availability of sensitive molecular detection systems show that around 15\u00c030% of hospitalized patients with pneumonia have a viral infection. Influenza virus, RSV and human metapneumovirus are the most common, followed by parainfluenza viruses, enteroviruses and coronavirus. In recent years novel strains of coronaviruses and avian influenza viruses have been recognized that are of great concern because of the associated high morbidity and mortality [38\u00c040].",

However, recent changes in healthcare delivery have resulted in substantial amounts of sophisticated and intensive care (e.g. chemotherapy, dialysis and wound care) being delivered in an outpatient setting. This practice has blurred the distinction between CAP and HAP and a more appropriate designation might be healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) [41] . Several factors contribute to substantial differences between the microbiology of CAP and HCAP. First, antimicrobial pressure in hospitals and nursing homes has driven sharp rises in the incidence of multidrugresistant bacteria. Also, hospitalized patients in intensive care units rapidly colonize their oropharynx with enteric Gram-negative bacilli and the widespread use of antacids and histamine type 2 blockers promotes stomach colonization with similar organisms [42] . Patient-related risks of HCAP include advanced age, multisystem organ failure, malnutrition and the numerous neurologic and other factors contributing to overt or silent aspiration. Infection control practices, such as hand hygiene and proper decontamination of medical equipment, also substantially affect the risk of infection. The single biggest risk of acquiring HCAP is the use of mechanical ventilation. Studies have documented up to a 20-fold increase in risk of infection compared to unventilated patients. Strategies to reduce the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia are currently topics of intense research interest [43] .",

A classic example is cystic fibrosis, a genetic defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. More than 1500 possible mutations have been identified and the disease occurs in approximately 1 in 2500 live births. It is recessively inherited and results in defective chloride ion transport across epithelial cell surfaces. In the lower respiratory tract this interferes with mucociliary clearance of inhaled pathogens and leads to early recruitment of neutrophils and other inflammatory defence mediators. Additionally, the high salt content in the surface liquid of the airways decreases the activity of beta-defensins, lysosome and other innate immune mechanisms. The end result is chronic colonization and recurrent infections with P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, H. influenzae and the Burkholderia cepacia group of bacteria [44] . Although survival rates for cystic fibrosis have improved dramatically over the past several decades, no effective treatment is available currently to reverse the underlying genetic defect that results in infection.

Leukopenia or absence of leukocytosis may indicate viral or granulomatous disease, but in the appropriate clinical setting can be a sign of severe sepsis. Lymphocytosis, particularly atypical lymphocytosis, suggests a viral cause. Thrombocytopaenia may indicate sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation or underlying bone marrow disease. Hyperglobulinaemia can result from either a chronic inflammatory disease (HIV, chronic infection, connective tissue disease) or a plasma cell or lymphocytic disorder with associated antibody deficiency or dysfunction. Abnormalities of liver or renal function imply a multisystem disease and should prompt a search for disseminated infection.",

During community outbreaks of RTIs, the agent should be fully identified from at least the first patients identified in the epidemic and the results provided to public health officials.",
