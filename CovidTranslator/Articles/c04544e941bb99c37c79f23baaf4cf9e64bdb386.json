In fact, several studies exploring and reporting the burden and clinical impact of RSV among adult populations across various geographical regions, in both outpatient and inpatient settings, have been published in the last two decades (Falsey et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2013; Volling et al., 2014; Mullooly et al., 2007; Thompson et al., 2003) , including in recent years (Colosia et al., 2017; Ambrosch et al., 2018; Belongia et al., 2018; Kestler et al., 2018; Ackerson et al., 2019) . RSV infections have been shown to be more severe among immunocompromised adults, those with cardiopulmonary conditions, and the elderly (Volling et al., 2014; Colosia et al., 2017; Belongia et al., 2018; Chatzis et al., 2018) . Notably, various studies have suggested that the disease burden associated with RSV infections in the adult population is higher than that resulting from influenza virus infections, including in older adults (Kwon et al., 2017; Ambrosch et al., 2018; Kestler et al., 2018; Ackerson et al., 2019) .",

In adults, the clinical features of RSV infection are nonspecific, making its distinction from other frequent respiratory viral infections challenging (Walsh et al., 2007; Walsh and Falsey 2012) . As a result, laboratory confirmation is needed to confidently establish an RSV infection diagnosis (Walsh and Falsey 2012) . Even still, compared to infants and young children, virus titers in respiratory secretions are lower and the shedding duration is shorter, further increasing the difficulty of RSV identification in adults (Hall 1978; Falsey and Walsh 2000; Walsh and Falsey 2012) . Optimal diagnosis requires Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays or serology, while antigen detection with immunofluorescent tests, enzyme immunoassays and cell culture are considered to be of low sensitivity in adults (Walsh and Falsey 2012) .",

As expected, considerable variation was found in the percentages of RSV identification reported by the included studies, even when considering only patients presenting with the same condition. Several factors may have contributed to the variability observed. First, one should consider that the case definitions used to define and select eligible patients differed across the included studies (Table 2 to Table 5 ). As a result, some heterogeneity is to be expected, even across studies focusing on the same condition (e.g., ILI). Second, further differences between included studies should be considered, such as disparities in the characteristics of the adult populations assessed, the different periods during which the studies were conducted, and the distinct methods used for RSV detection.

In Chile, the RSV season generally starts in April, peaks between June and July, and drops in September (Bardach et al., 2014) . In Mexico, a study conducted in patients aged 0-18 years reported that RSV infections occurred less commonly in the warmer months of the year (between March and June) and peaked in the cooler months (between August and March) (Rodr\u00edguez-Auad et al., 2012) . The RSV seasonal pattern is variable across Brazilian regions, which has been attributed to differences in climate characteristics across the country. In S\u00e3o Paulo (Southeast region), RSV season usually peaks between autumn and winter. In the Northeast region, RSV peaks have been observed in the rainy and winter seasons Med Crave (2016) . In Colombia, a pediatric study reported that most RSV infections (63.6%) occurred between March and May (Rodr\u00edguez-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2015) . In Guatemala, the PAHO weekly reports suggest the existence of a long RSV season, peaking at different times throughout the years. Still, based on data from 2015 to 2018, one may observe that the peak generally occurs between July and October (PAHO, 2019). This review included three studies with durations less than one year. Two of these studies (Fernandes-Matano et al., 2017; Rioseco et al., 2012) had study durations of approximately 11 months, which are not expected to have influenced the percentage of RSV detection reported. The study by Riquelme et al. (2014) , however, was a five-month study conducted within the RSV season in Chile, which may have overestimated the prevalence of this virus.",

            "text": "Three studies reported the percent of RSV detection among subjects presenting with Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) in Latin American countries. According to the WHO, ARI is defined as a sudden/acute onset of at least one of the following four respiratory symptoms: cough, sore throat, shortness of breath and coryza (WHO, 2017) . Indeed, the presence of respiratory symptoms was part of the case-definitions for ARI of all three studies (Watanabe et al., 2011; McCracken et al., 2013; Ramirez et al., 2014) . In addition to this criterion, patients also had to present fever (ambulatory setting) or at least one sign of acute infection (hospital setting) to be included in the study by McCracken et al (McCracken et al., 2013) . ARIs are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the adult population, these infections are the most typical cause of outpatient care. Several distinct microorganisms may cause these infections, with an estimate of up to 80% of cases being due to a viral etiological agent. Globally, influenza viruses are amongst the primary causative agents of ARI, though various other respiratory viruses (namely RSV) may cause these infections (Fernandes-Matano et al., 2017) . In Colombia, RSV accounted for a considerable amount of ARI cases between 2000 and 2011, with 31.7% of infections in adults aged !31 years testing positive for this virus. In Guatemala, a much lower detection of RSV was reported, with similar percentages being found among hospital and clinic patients aged !18 years (5.6% and 5.4%, respectively). The lack of positive samples for RSV in Brazil may have resulted from the small number of samples assessed (49). The WHO defines ILI as an ARI with measured fever of !38 C, cough and an onset within the last ten days (WHO, 2014) . Generally, the case-definitions for ILI of the included studies focusing on this condition differed from the one by WHO and between studies. Unlike the WHO definition, various studies did not consider cough and fever as necessary to define an ILI case. On one hand, patients could present other respiratory symptoms (namely shortness of breath, nasal congestion and sore throat) instead of cough. On the other, patients could present nonrespiratory or other systemic symptoms (such as malaise, headache, myalgia and chest pain) in place of fever. Lastly, most studies did not specify a maximum time for the onset of the symptoms. Most studies focusing on ILI reported percentages of RSV detection not exceeding 5%. The highest percentage (16.4%) was found in hospitalized patients aged !65 years, in Chile (Riquelme et al., 2014) . Still, it should be noted that this study had a short duration (May to September 2012) and was conducted during the RSV season (Bardach et al., 2014) , which may explain the high percentage of RSV infections reported.",

            "text": "RSV has been described as one of the leading causes of CAP among adults, surpassed only by the Streptococcus pneumoniae and influenza viruses (Dowell et al., 1996) . This is in agreement with one of the included studies, in which RSV infection was established in 13.5% of CAP adult patients, in Chile. Notably, RSV was the second most commonly isolated pathogen, behind Streptococcus pneumoniae (21.1%) (Luchsinger et al., 2012) . Conversely, two other studies conducted in Chile have reported low percentages of RSV detection (1.3% and 2.9%) (Rioseco et al., 2012; Pe\u00f1afiel et al., 2016) . In one of these studies (Rioseco et al., 2012) , the use of Direct Immunofluorescence (DIF) for the detection of respiratory viruses may have resulted in an underdiagnosis of RSV. Nonetheless, a similar percentage has been reported among hospitalized adults with CAP in Canada (2.6%) (Johnstone et al., 2008) . Two of these three studies (Pe\u00f1afiel et al., 2016; Rioseco et al., 2012) used the same CAP definition, based on the diagnosis criteria for CAP proposed by Fang et al. (Fang et al., 1990) . These criteria are as follows: 1) infiltrate in a chest X-ray taken on admission and 2) presence of one or more major findings (cough, mucopurulent or hemoptic expectoration, axillary temperature over 37.8 C), or at least two minor findings (pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, decreased level of consciousness, lung tissue condensation observed in the physical examination, or a white blood count of over 12 000/mL). The remaining study (Luchsinger et al., 2012) used a different definition, consisting of the presence of acute respiratory symptoms for one week and a chest radiograph displaying new pulmonary radiographs.",

Still, those that did show that a considerable proportion of RSV-infected adult patients (!18 years) presenting with ILI required hospitalization in Mexico (from 40.9% to 69.9%) (Galindo-Fraga et al., 2013; Gami\u00f1o-Arroyo et al., 2017) . Of note, in both studies, the majority of RSV-infected adults were aged 50 years (approximately 63.2%: 63/108) and <60 years (approximately 65.2%: 15/23), respectively. These results suggest that RSV infections may be a significant cause of hospitalization in the adult populations, including younger adults. Nonetheless, older patients were shown to be at an increased risk for hospitalization (Gami\u00f1o-Arroyo et al., 2017) . One study reported the percentage of hospitalizations in patients with RSV-related CAP. Naturally, the percentages found were even higher (91.7%) than those reported for ILI patients (Luchsinger et al., 2012) . Finally, a study in Guatemala showed a substantial burden among hospitalized adult patients with RSV, as 19.6% required intensive care admission or mechanical ventilation, were discharged in moribund conditions, or died. Once again, though the highest percentage was found in those aged !65 years (26.3%), a considerable percentage of severe outcomes (18.2%) was found in younger hospitalized patients (18 to 49 years) (McCracken et al., 2013) .",

The present review demonstrates that RSV is a cause of illness in adults and the elderly in Latin America and suggests that RSV infections may be a significant cause of hospitalization, including in younger adults. Still, the low number of included studies (reflecting the scarcity of recent RSV data on adult populations in Latin America), coupled with the high variability of RSV identification percentages across studies, make it difficult to infer the real RSV burden in this region. Thus, further studies focusing on adult populations at risk for RSV infections in Latin America, particularly conducted during RSV seasons, could prove valuable to provide a clearer and more accurate picture of the virus' real burden.",

Third, because only a small number of included studies focused exclusively on adults, most did not characterize the adult populations assessed for RSV.
