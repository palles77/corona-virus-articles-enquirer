Successful implementation of such assays will require appropriate control materials to confirm assay performance and sensitivity. Methods: A common reference material containing 25 target viruses was produced and 16 laboratories were invited to process it using their preferred adventitious virus detection assay. Results: Fifteen laboratories returned results, obtained using a wide range of wet-lab and informatics methods. Six of 25 target viruses were detected by all laboratories, with the remaining viruses detected by 4-14 laboratories. Six non-target viruses were detected by three or more laboratories. Conclusion: The study demonstrated that a wide range of methods are currently used for adventitious virus detection screening in biological products by deep sequencing and that they can yield significantly different results. This underscores the need for common reference materials to ensure satisfactory assay performance and enable comparisons between laboratories.",

Testing for adventitious viruses is therefore an essential quality control step in the manufacture of vaccines and other biological medicines. Non-specific screening for adventitious viruses is partly based on animal tests which have served well for decades, but there are legal and ethical imperatives to replace such tests. Cell culture tests largely solve the ethical issues and are cheaper to perform, and recent efforts to compare sensitivity and specificity with animal tests have been promising [3] . Nevertheless, cell and animal tests are limited by the restricted tropism of some viruses and may not detect non-cytopathic, non-pathogenic or nonhaemadsorbing viruses. For example, porcine circovirus (PCV) DNA was detected in two rotavirus vaccines [1, 4, 5] despite these routine adventitious virus tests showing no evidence of contamination. PCR-based tests offer sensitive and specific detection of their target pathogens, however screening for all potential viruses by PCR is impractical, and non-target viruses would remain undetected.",

            "text": "Deep sequencing (DS, also referred to as massively parallel or high throughput sequencing) offers the potential for identification of extraneous nucleic acid in samples without a priori knowledge of the likely contaminant and without the requirement for propagation of the virus. Such methods have already been successfully applied to detection of adventitious agents in vaccines [1] , cell lines [6, 7] , serum [8, 9] and bioreactors [10] and multiple laboratory and informatics methods for viral metagenomics have been developed for clinical and other biological specimens [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . There is substantial interest among vaccine manufacturers, contract research organisations, regulators and medicines control laboratories in evaluating the method for routine safety testing, and potentially replacing some or all of the existing in vitro and in vivo tests. A major challenge to the realisation of this potential is the identification of a robust, sensitive and specific assay design. A wide range of methods exist for viral metagenomics, many of which are early in their development: multiple options exist for generation of sequencing libraries; several commercial sequencing platforms exist, based on fundamentally different chemistry, with more in development; numerous bioinformatics pipelines are used for sequence classification, both academically and commercially developed; and the databases against which the reads are searched are constantly evolving. Given these parameters, it is important to have suitable reference materials to ensure that different methods generate comparable results. In addition to reagents for comparison of methods and determination of run performance, well-characterised materials of defined virus concentration will be required in order to determine limits of detection for particular viruses or virus types. We describe here a candidate material for qualitative comparison of methods and run performance and its evaluation in an international collaborative study encompassing 15 laboratories. The study highlighted that a broad range of laboratory and informatics techniques are in use, and no consensus exists on the most appropriate combination of methods to achieve maximum sensitivity. We discuss the major challenges for the incorporation of deep sequencing into adventitious agent testing workflows, highlight areas requiring particular attention and describe the requirements of future reference materials to enable validation and comparison of methods.",

Identifying the optimal processing parameters for each step of the process was not feasible given the large number of variables. This study did not aim to assess sensitivity of any particular method, nor the proficiency of the individual laboratories. An outline of this project was presented to the World Health Organisation (WHO) Expert Committee for Biological Standardisation (ECBS) at the 2013 meeting and the committee felt that the project could provide useful information on the value of the reference material and the merits of currently used methods [18] .",

The origin of each virus is described in Table 1 . Realtime PCR (RT-PCR) Cycle Threshold (Ct) values were determined for individual virus stocks, and the viruses were then pooled such that the predicted Ct value of each would be approximately 30. Pooled virus was formulated in 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2% foetal calf serum. 1 ml of reagent was filled into 2856 2 ml screw-cap Sarstedt vials and frozen at \u221270 \u2022 C. Samples of pooled material were assessed by in-house RT-PCR (see Supplemental table* 1 for PCR conditions) to determine the presence of the 25 viruses (Table 1) . Not all viruses were detected following formulation -hence development of the reagent as a qPCR control was ceased and the material was deemed an ideal candidate for the current study. Infectivity of pooled viruses was not confirmed as the intended use was in nucleic-acid based detection methods. The precise concentrations of individual viruses are not known, however RT-PCR data suggest the viruses are present at a range of nucleic acid concentrations (Ct values range from \u223c24 to not detectable, Table 1 ). A previous study found that up to 22 of the 25 viruses were detectable by sequencing at modest read depth (\u223c2,000,000 reads) [14] . The presence of additional viruses in the reagent was considered a possibility due to the isolation of several of the target viruses from human clinical specimens, the propagation of others in cell culture and the addition of foetal calf serum to the reagent. The presence of such viruses was not known in advance.",

The discrepancies in detection of target viruses may in part be attributable to the assay design. For example, assays targeting only particle-protected nucleic acid and using nuclease may discriminate against certain signals, relative to those targeting total nucleic acid, though notably one laboratory that identified all 25 viruses (L02) reported using nuclease. Extraction methods may also affect the ability to detect different viruses [14] and variable efficiency of reverse transcriptase steps may bias against detection of RNA viruses. Sequencing library preparation typically requires nanogram to microgram amounts of DNA that may be challenging to obtain from certain starting materials. Lower amounts of DNA may yield adequate sequencing libraries in some cases, but deviating significantly from recommended inputs may be problematic in a Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) or Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) environment. Amplification by PCR or Phi29-based systems was employed by two laboratories, however the risk of bias due to different template preferences should be considered. As with any molecular technique, the inclusion of no template controls is essential to avoid or identify false positives due to trace contamination of the sample extraction columns [7, 20] , molecular biology reagents [7, 21] or sample-to-sample contamination during library preparation or sequencing [22] .",

Competition by non-viral nucleic acids, e.g. from host cells, will negatively impact limits of detection, and the concentration of such may vary significantly between sample types. In such cases, nuclease treatment may increase sensitivity for particle-protected viruses, but should be used with caution for the reasons described in the previous section.

The size of sequencing datasets and reference databases continues to grow, offering obvious advantages in terms of sensitivity; however this has necessitated the development of new sequence classification algorithms to enable data analysis within a reasonable time, at a cost of potentially increased false negative rate [24] [25] [26] [27] . A range of methods were used in the current study and thresholds for assigning hits varied, with some laboratories reporting detection of a virus on the basis of a single read but others requiring that additional criteria were met. Viral identification stringency should be determined by the context. A low stringency will maximise the chance of detecting novel viruses which may be highly divergent from databases references at the risk of increased false positives, and may be appropriate e.g. for screening of master cell and virus banks where follow-up testing can be performed. In a routine testing scheme, or where a defined set of contaminants is being screened for, higher stringency may be appropriate to minimise false positives, e.g. due to matches with host sequences similar to viral genes. While the current study focussed on the detection of known viruses, many of the pipelines employed are entirely compatible with virus discovery investigations simply by altering the processing and search parameters. We also observed variation in the databases used for sequence classification. Publicly available databases such as those hosted by NCBI [28] are valuable but incomplete and not curated, and consideration is needed of what action should be taken if sequencing reads that are currently non-classified are later identified as being of viral origin. The size, breadth and complexity of databases can pose a challenge to sequence identification pipelines, especially when databases contain entries whose taxonomy is erroneously assigned. It may therefore be advisable for adventitious virus screens to be performed using curated databases, even though their breadth of coverage may be more limited.",

However, circovirus and parvovirus sequences were detected in the sample by three and four laboratories respectively (Table 3) , providing evidence for the presence of these ssDNA viruses in the reagent, albeit at a low level. The most commonly reported non-target virus, Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus, likely originates from the foetal bovine serum used in the reagent, as does the Bovine Parvovirus. The detection of Human Bocavirus and Aichi Virus most likely reflects the use of faecal samples as a source for several of the target viruses (Table 1) , while the 'Human Enterovirus' category likely reflects a combination of authentic enteroviruses from the faecal samples and potentially mis-classification of reads originating from Coxsackievirus and Rhinovirus. Only short sequence contigs were obtained for the circoviruses and definitive identification was not achieved, hence the origin of these viral reads cannot be determined.",

Empirical definition of limits of detection for all possible viruses is impractical, but limits of detection for a set of viruses representing all major genome and coat types is a minimal starting point, with potential extension to include the full set of viruses for which screening is mandatory.",
