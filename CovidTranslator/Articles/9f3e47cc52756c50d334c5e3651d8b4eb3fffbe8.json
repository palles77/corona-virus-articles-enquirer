Prior to the first description of the phenomenon in nematodes a decade ago, gene silencing had been described in plants and in fungi and was termed posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) [1, 2] and quelling [3, 4] respectively. These phenomenon were later found to act similarly to RNAi.",

This is done by the Dicer enzyme, which belongs to the RNase III family [5] [6] [7] [8] . Dicer enzymes are multidomain proteins, about 200 kDa in size, which possess an RNA helicase domain, a PAZ domain for binding nucleic acids, preferably to RNA [8, 9] , a catalytic domain and a double-strand-RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) [10] . For its nuclease activity the enzyme recognizes the ends of the molecule and excises dsRNA fragments from one end to form 19-to 27-nt-long siRNA molecules with a 5\u00a2 phosphate end and an overhang of 3\u00a2 dinucleotides [11, 12] . Interestingly, E. coli RNase III can be used to perform the dsRNA cleavage to a fully active siRNA substrate that can be used as a siRNAs pool for gene silencing [13, 14] .",

The PAZ domains of both the Dicer and the Ago-2 proteins interact with the 3\u00a2 end of the siRNA [21, 22] , with which they thereby form a three-component connection [23, 24] . This three-component interaction, mediated by the PAZ domains, is probably responsible for the transfer of newly formed siRNA to RISC [23] . The second domain that characterizes Ago-2 is a PIWI domain that is structurally similar to the RNasHI and RNaseHII domains [23] [24] [25] . Furthermore, a bioinformatics approach revealed that the PIWI domain from Drosophila melanogaster is related to the endonuclease V protein family [15] . All these findings indicate that Ago-2 exhibits a complete set of RISC features (Fig. 2) .",

This phenomenon is exactly what was recorded when the inhibition of poliovirus was examined over a long period of time: even a single mutation resulted in G:U mismatching that suppressed the viral inhibition by the siRNA. Moreover, in each experiment several escaping viruses were isolated [40] that exhibited different mutations at the siRNA site. To overcome this adverse effect, Gitlin et al. [41] used a mixture of siRNA molecules originated from a Dicer-treated of 1-kbp segment dsRNA that corresponded to the viral sequences. Since the mixture contained siRNA molecules aimed against numerous sites on the viral genome, a small number of mutations should not affect the overall inhibitory effect and would not permit the emergence of revertantes. When the experiments were performed no escaping viruses could be detected, at least for the duration of the experiments.",

FMDV also belongs to the Aphtopicornavirus genus of the Picornaviridae family infecting cloven-hoofed animals and is the most important farm animal pathogen. In order to silence the virus completely Kahana et al. [41] searched among all the viral entries in the GenBank database for viral sequences that showed 100% homology with any FMD virus over at least a 22-base-long segment. The analysis revealed three such sequences, which became the bases for synthesizing three siRNA molecules corresponding to these three sites. When cells were transfected with individual siRNA molecules prior to being infected, inhibition rates were between 80 and 90%; when they were simultaneously transfected with all three, complete inhibition of virus replication was obtained, as observed by the use of realtime RT-quantitive (q)PCR and virus titers. It could be argued that this approach would also lead to inhibition of all the seven different viral serotypes through use of the same siRNAs molecules; and this should be achievable since the target sequences should be present in most if not all FMDVs, regardless of their origin. Moreover, the conservation of sequences throughout viral evolution indicates that there is a very strong selective pressure against mutations, which has preserved the sequences from changes in the course of virus evolution. This same selective pressure would maintain the siRNAs target sequences unchanged, so ensuring the proper activity of the described siRNAs [41] .",

Yokota and coworkers [46] used this design strategy to design siRNA molecules targeted to various regions of the 5\u00a2 UTR IRES sequence. In tests of six siRNAs genes, silencing levels were not uniform: only the siRNA corresponding to a region upstream of the AUG start codon could provide a high inhibition rate. Not only were all the genes not equally effective; there was an siRNA molecule that had an opposite effect, i.e., it increased the replication rate [46] . Contrary to this observation Takigawa et al. [47] reported that an siRNA targeted to this region was unable to inhibit the replication of the virus. On the other hand, the same authors found that siRNA targeted against the NS3 and NS5B regions, which are less conserved than the 5\u00a2 UTR, were also highly effective in inhibiting virus activity and achieved 90% inhibition [47] .",

It was originally an avian virus that crossed the species barrier to infect humans, and is characterized by its high mortality rate among infected people. This phenomenon caused a severe health problem worldwide, and especially in Southeast Asia and Canada, where cases of human infection were found. The genome, like other coronaviruses is a ssRNA of positive orientation, about 30 kb in length. As in the cases of other described viruses, several siRNAs were targeted to various locations on the viral genome, against the viral replicase [55] and the spike gene [56] [57] [58] were designed; their ability to silence the expression of those genes, and also to inhibit viral replication was demonstrated.",

Since several excellent reviews on this subject have been published, only one aspect of virus inhibition will be discussed in the present review, namely the various means that were used to overcome the phenomenon of virus escapes that resulted from the high rate of mutation of the virus and prevented the future use of this approach for therapeutic purposes. Because of the exceedingly high mutation rate of viral genome, the siRNA target sequences are also mutated at a very high rate [62, 63] , which impairs the long-term effectiveness of siRNAs, and eventually leads to the emergence of escaping viruses that overcome the effect of siRNA on virus replication [64] [65] [66] . The severity of the phenomenon is indicated by the facts that when the sequences of siRNA targets on the genomes of the virus were determined it was found that not only mutations at the target sequences could break down siRNA activity, but that mutations that are adjacent to the actual target sequences could also stop siRNA activity.",

            "text": "Several attempts were made to address this issue. One approach involved the scanning of virus sequences in order to find regions of conserved sequences that were located across the viral genome and raising siRNA genes corresponding to these regions [67] . By means of this approach, siRNA molecules corresponding to gag, pol, int and vpu sequences were shown to inhibit three different HIV strains effectively [67] . Although the long-term protection was not evaluated it seems that this approach has the potential for finding viral sequences in which a mutation would result in the production of attenuated or non-viable viruses. Moreover, the use of several such siRNA genes simultaneously would have an excellent chance to protect against the appearance of escape viruses, by overcoming the selective pressure against siRNA activity, as predicted by a model developed by Leonard and Shaffer [68] . This is a stochastic computer model for testing different approaches to overcome the appearance of mutations that escape from siRNA; it predicted that the use of several siRNAs targeted to different locations would dramatically increase siRNA efficacy. The model also predicted that a small increase in the number of siRNA targets would drastically increase the efficiency of the siRNA approach, by reducing or eliminating the appearance of escaping viruses. That study [68] also highlighted the importance of the transformation efficiency of the siRNA gene or molecules in ensuring that each infected cell contain the siRNA molecules; if there were HIV-producing cells that did not carry the inhibitory molecules, virus replication would continue in these cells and so increase the likelihood of the appearance of escaping viruses.",

Such functions are performed by cell viral receptors on the cell membrane, such as CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5. When siRNA targeted to the CD4, CXCR4, and CCR5 genes were tested it was found that HIV replication could be suppressed through the repression of virus entry, which conferred resistance to HIV-1 infection [69] . An interesting approach that was taken in the same study [69] involved the use of bispecific short hairpin (sh)RNA molecules that were targeted against two different genes. Even though silencing of CD4 can suppress virus infection effectively, such silencing would not be a practicable approach because of the importance of the CD4 protein in the immune system.",

Several transit expressed siRNAs targeted to sequences located throughout the viral genome were tested and were found to elicit large-scale inhibition of virus replication [74] . As mentioned earlier, one of the main concerns regarding siRNA delivery is transfection efficiency, since siRNA molecules, either in the form of dsRNA or as expressible vectors, must enter all infected cells in order to stop virus replication completely. One way to ensure this is through the use of stable transformed cells, which guarantees the presence of siRNA in every infected cell, as reported by Chen et al. [75] , who tested 10 different siRNA genes aimed at all viral genes and were able to show that viral RNA levels could be reduced by up to 90%. One important aspect of using siRNA activity against DNA viruses is the need to show the inhibition of viral DNA replication, and when the amounts of viral DNA were quantified almost no viral DNA could be detected, which demonstrated the inhibition of genome replication similarly to the inhibition of the genome replication in RNA viruses [75] . Since the result of an in vitro assay is only an indicator for a practical application the potential of this approach must be tested in vivo, as was performed by Giladi et al. [76] and Uprichard et al. [77] . Giladi et al. [76] showed that co-injection of a plasmid carrying an HBV genome and a plasmid carrying siRNA genes correspond-ing to sequences of the small HBV surface antigene (HbsAg) there was a marked decrease of both HBsAg and HBeAg, and a 50% decrease of all three viral mRNAs. By far the most dramatic effect was on viral DNA replication: up to 3 days after injection the viral DNA remained at undetectable levels.",
