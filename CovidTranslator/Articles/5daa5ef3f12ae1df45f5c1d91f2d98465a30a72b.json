            "text": "A simple protocol for generating a highly stable and active surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensor surface of recombinant human hexahistidine cyclophilin A (His-CypA) is described. The sensor surface was sensitive and stable enough to allow, for the first time, the screening and ranking of several novel small-molecule (M r $250-500 Da) ligands in a competition binding assay with cyclosporin A (CsA). It also allowed us to accurately determine the kinetic rate constants for the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. His-CypA was first captured on a Ni 2+ -nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor chip and was then briefly covalently stabilized, coupling via primary amines. The significant baseline drift observed due to dissociation of weakly bound His-CypA from the Ni 2+ -NTA moiety was eliminated, resulting in a surface that was stable for at least 36 h. In addition, immobilized protein activity levels were high, typically between 85 and 95%, assayed by the interaction between His-CypA and CsA. The mean equilibrium dissociation constant for CsA (K dCsA ) binding to the immobilized His-CypA was 23 \u00b1 6 nM, with on and off rates of 0.53 \u00b1 0.1 lM \u00c01 s \u00c01 and 1.2 \u00b1 0.1 (\u00b710 \u00c02 ) s \u00c01 , respectively. These values agree well with the values for the corresponding binding constants determined from steady-state and kinetic fluorescence titrations in solution. sulfoxide; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; BSA, bovine serum albumin. www.elsevier.com/locate/yabio Analytical Biochemistry 345 (2005) 214-226 ANALYTICAL BIOCHEMISTRY",

            "text": "Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) 1 is now a technique exploited regularly in the determination of equilibrium binding and kinetic rate constants of biomolecular interactions [1] [2] [3] [4] . It is also increasingly useful in drug discovery/hit validation studies with small molecules [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . A prerequisite for measuring the binding constants of an interaction by SPR is that the surface-immobilized molecule must be both stably attached and highly active. Most immobilization procedures are reliant on direct covalent linkage of a purified protein to chemically activated sensor surfaces. Such procedures generate stable surfaces. However, a significant proportion of proteins are not compatible with either the solution conditions or the surface chemistry used. As a result, many biomolecules have very low activity, or often become completely inactive, on immobilization. Over and above the loss of activity due to modification of critical residues involved in binding sites, the essentially random orientation resulting from covalent coupling leads to subpopulations of immobilized molecules that are incorrectly oriented for binding. There are a number of capture methods available (e.g., antibodies, biotinylation, oligohistidine tags) that can be used as alternatives to direct covalent coupling. However, the sensor surface often has a relatively low binding capacity and/or exhibits significant baseline drift due to the relatively weakly bound captured molecule dissociating from the surface. For example, single hexahistidine-tagged proteins captured on Ni 2+ -nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) sensor surfaces have K d values in the low micromolar range [12] . Such leaching makes it difficult to assess binding kinetics accurately.",

The cyclophilins [13] have emerged recently as a potential drug target for a several diseases, including HIV and malaria infection [14, 15] . The SPR-based binding assay described here provides the basis of a screen for novel small-molecule cyclophilin inhibitors of potential therapeutic interest. The in vivo role of human cyclophilin A (CypA) is poorly understood, but its ability to enhance the rate of folding (or unfolding) of proteins via its peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) activity is likely to be important, particularly when the cell is stressed [13, 16] . CypA was isolated as a complex with the immunosuppressive cyclic undecapeptide cyclosporin A (CsA) [17] , which is used as a therapy for preventing organ rejection following transplants. CsA acts by complex formation with cytosolic CypA, followed by binding and inhibition of the phosphatase calcineurin, blocking the signal transduction pathway for immunostimulation [18] . Previous work has identified many cyclosporin derivatives as CypA inhibitors [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , but there are very few published examples that characterize nonpeptide inhibitor binding [26, 27] .",

            "text": "The development of an SPR-based assay for screening small-molecule ligands requires a stable and sensitive CypA sensor surface. Human CypA is not readily amenable to direct covalent immobilization on a CM5 sensor, or on a streptavidin (SA) sensor, using standard coupling chemistries. In our hands, these coupling protocols generated surfaces with very low levels of protein activity, typically only approximately 5%. Surfaces with such low levels of activity are neither active nor sensitive enough to facilitate the detection of small molecules. Although interactions between CypA, directly coupled to the sensor surface, and protein binding partners analyzed by SPR have been published [28] [29] [30] , the activity of immobilized protein and the sensitivity of the sensor required to detect binding of these much larger molecules are significantly less than those needed to detect smallmolecule ligands. In contrast, when His-CypA was first captured and oriented via its N-terminal hexahistidine tag on an NTA sensor surface and then was briefly covalently stabilized, using standard chemistries to activate the surface and couple via primary amines, the baseline drift was completely eliminated and the surface activity levels typically were in excess of 85%. These sensor surfaces allowed us, for the first time, to assess and rank the equilibrium dissociation constants (K d ) for several new small-molecule ($300-500 Da) inhibitors of CypA.",

Activity of NTA-captured, covalently stabilized His-CypA Next, we wanted to assess the activity of the immobilized protein on the sensor surfaces. This was performed by passing saturating concentrations (>0.95 lM) of the naturally occurring tight binding ligand (K d $ 10-40 nM, Table 1 ) CsA over the sensor surfaces. CsA is a cyclic undecapeptide fungal metabolite with immunosuppressive properties that is widely used in transplant surgery [13] . The surface activity of various sensor surfaces is represented graphically in Fig. 2 . His-CypA captured and covalently stabilized on the NTA surface retained very high levels of activity, typically in excess of 85% ( Fig. 2A) . In comparison, the immobilized protein on the surface of the CM5 chips retained only approximately 5% activity (Fig. 2B) . Similarly, only 7% activity was retained by biotinylated CypA immobilized on an SA sensor surface (Fig. 2B) . Pure CypA was biotinylated using standard primary amine coupling chemistries before immobilization on the SA chip (see Materials and methods).",

We wanted to test whether the His-CypA sensor surfaces described in the above sections could be used to facilitate the primary screening of these smallmolecule (M r $300-500 Da) ligand libraries. Fig. 5A graphically illustrates the equilibrium response signal attained for 120 lM of the respective ligands. These compounds were chosen as positive controls to assess the sensor surface because they have previously been shown to bind to CypA with K d values in the 10-to 100-lM range ( Table 2 ). One problem encountered was that the ligands tested have limited solubility in aqueous buffers, and this led to significant variation in the response signals for repeat runs of the same ligand. In addition, large ''spikes'' in the RU signal at the beginning and end of the injection phases further hampered reliable direct detection (data not shown). These can likely be attributed to a bulk phase shift given that there are large amounts of insoluble material present during the mobile phase as it passes over the chip surface with protein attached. Ethanol (2%) was added to the running buffer to help ligand solubility for all runs. Higher concentrations of either ethanol or methanol resulted in protein denaturation and rapid loss of activity on the sensor surface on subsequent runs (data not shown). DMSO was avoided as a solvent because this binds to CypA itself, albeit very weakly [31] .

Our results here illustrate, however, that CypA is not amenable to direct covalent linkage using primary amines. Protein activity levels for CypA directly immobilized on CM5 surfaces were only approximately 5%. This activity was unaffected by the initial immobilization levels; immobilization of between 1000 and 5000 RU of untagged CypA gave essentially the same low levels of activity (Fig. 2B) . The X-ray structure indicates that the majority of CypA\u00d5s 16 primary amines (15 lysine residues and the N terminus) are surface exposed [33] and probably available for direct covalent linkage. However, the surface electrostatic potential of CypA (Fig. 6) illustrates that the front face (the CsA binding face) is strikingly basic, whereas the rear face is much more acidic in character. Under the solution conditions (pH 4.9) used during the immobilization process, the surface charge potential of CypA seems likely to force the molecule to orient itself with the CsA binding surface oriented downward toward the activated chip surface. Thus, most of the covalent linkage would occur via residues on the CsA binding surface, resulting in severe steric occlusion of the binding of CsA. The activity levels of CypD immobilized by direct covalent linkage, under similar conditions and with similar final protein immobilization levels, were approximately 45 to 65% [32] . However, CypD does not possess the same markedly polarized surface charge potential of CypA; thus, coupling via primary amines is unlikely to take place predominantly on the CsA binding face.",

Using the N-terminal histidine tag to first capture CypA on the NTA sensor surface seems to provide a measure of orientation for the immobilized protein. The 10-amino acid linker between the hexahistidine tag and the start of the CypA sequence likely lifts CypA away from the active chip surface, preventing coupling to random lysine residues that hinder/prevent CsA binding. The only primary amine near enough to the activated sensor surface is the N terminus, and the entropic effects of being immobilized near the surface via the histidine tag may provide specificity for coupling essentially only to this primary amine. Thus, the protein is covalently immobilized but is kept active and sterically competent for CsA binding.",

K dBia values were calculated from the off-and on-rate constants (k \u00c0 and k + , respectively) determined from SPR competition experiments in the presence of 25 nM CsA and using the formula K dBia = k \u00c0 /k + . Mean K dFluor values were determined from competition fluorescence titration experiments (see Materials and methods) (data not shown). isoforms determined in this study ($0.5 lM \u00c01 s \u00c01 ) and in that by Huber and coworkers ($0.3 lM \u00c01 s \u00c01 ) [32] are somewhat slower than a diffusion limited on rate ($10 lM \u00c01 s \u00c01 ), as one might have expected for a relatively small molecule such as CsA (M r $1200 Da). The hydrophobic cyclic undecapeptide CsA is in multistate equilibrium between two extreme conformations influenced by the solution conditions. In aqueous solution, CsA tends more to adopt a compact closed conformation [37] , whereas cyclophilins bind tightly only to an open conformation. The slower than diffusion limit on-rate constants might reflect the CsA conformational equilibrium. The off-rate constant for the CypA:CsA interaction appears to be two-to threefold quicker than that between CsA and CypD (0.012 and 0.004 s \u00c01 , respectively [32] ) ( Table 1 ). This slight difference may reflect genuine differences in the molecular details of the interaction between CsA and these two differentially localized, functionally distinct cyclophilin isoforms. CypA is ubiquitously localized in mammalian cytoplasm [13] , whereas CypD is a mitochondrial-targeted PPIase [38] . Nevertheless, the binding constants obtained in this study for the equilibrium dissociation constant for CsA binding to His-CypA by SPR agree well with the values for the same interaction determined by a variety of experimental approaches, including ITC, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, and PPIase enzymatic assays ( Table 1 ). This does suggest that the protein molecules immobilized on the chip surface behave in a manner comparable to that of protein molecules in solution, at least in terms of binding to CsA. The results in this study illustrate the sensitivity of SPR in that we were able to reliably detect the direct binding of small-molecular weight ligands (300-500 Da) (Fig. 5A) . However, the on rates for these small-molecule inhibitors are very slow ($0.4-0.7 \u00b7 10 \u00c03 lM \u00c01 s \u00c01 ) ( Table 2) , orders of magnitude slower than even CsA itself. Although they appear to bind specifically to CypA, there may be some conformational constraint on these small molecules that requires a degree of ''induced fit'' in terms of their binding mechanism. Structural data of these cyclophilin-ligand complexes are not available, and the bound conformation of the ligands is not known. Poor solubility, aggregation, and/or nonspecific binding of the ligands may also play a role in the calculation of their apparently slow on rate, and it is possible that the functional ligand concentration, competent to interact with the immobilized His-CypA, is less than the expected measured total. This would result in the apparent on rates being faster and the equilibrium dissociation constants being tighter. However, this is unlikely to cause orders of magnitude changes in these kinetic constants. It is reassuring to note that despite the slow calculated on rates, the apparent K d values for these ligands and the rank order of their relative affinities determined from the competition experiments agree with the values determined by intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence experiments.",

The average level of His-CypA finally stabilized on the NTA sensor surfaces in this study was approximately 1000 RU. This corresponds to approximately 3 \u00b7 10 10 protein molecules within a volume of approximately 1 \u00b7 10 14 nm 3 and provides an average intermolecular spacing between each CypA molecule of more than 100 \u00c5 This rather sparse but stable binding arrangement may explain the good agreement in the values for the kinetic and equilibrium constants among the SPR data, the solution fluorescence data, and other published data determined by other techniques.",

Conversely, our study provides a good general methodology for generating a highly sensitive, stable, and reusable sensor surface of His-CypA that interacts with CsA in a manner essentially indistinguishable from that determined by other experimental approaches. Furthermore, it provides a good methodology that would allow the development of a mediumthroughput screen for small molecules ligands/inhibitors of CypA that may provide useful leads in developing new drugs for the treatment of diseases such as HIV and malaria.",

Panels A and B show the reference-corrected sensorgrams corresponding to the injection (phases a1-a2) of 850 nM His-CypA over a Ni 2+ -NTA sensor surface. (A) After saturation of the signal response ($3100 RU in this experiment), the injection of protein was stopped and the sensor surface was washed with 10 mM Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, and 2% ethanol at 5 ll min \u00c01 for 2.5 h. The response signal drops steadily due to His-CypA dissociating from the surface (phase b). Phase a2, where a slight drop in the response signal is observed during the injection phase, is likely due to a loss of rebinding[12] resulting from the relatively high concentration of His-CypA passed over the surface. For all concentrations of His-CypA tested (200 nM-1 lM), all of the initially immobilized protein could be completely dissociated form the Ni 2+ -NTA surface after washing with running buffer for P2 h ( * ). (B) Following saturation of the RU signal (phases a1-a2), a 30-s injection (at 15 ll min \u00c01 ) of a mixture of NHS (115 mg ml \u00c01 ) and EDC (750 mg ml \u00c01 ) (phase c), followed immediately by a 30-s injection (at 15 ll min \u00c01 ) of 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5) (phase d), was performed. This brief covalent stabilization phase, via primary amine coupling, eliminates the slow dissociation of the histidine tag from the NTA moiety (phase b) on the sensor surface. The final amount of His-CypA covalently immobilized on the surface was between approximately 850 and 1600 RU.",

The steady-state fluorescence enhancement at 342 nm (DF 342nm ) of 0.25 lM CypA is plotted versus the concentration of CsA in nanomolars.
