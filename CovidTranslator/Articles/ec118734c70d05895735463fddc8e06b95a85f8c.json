SARI was defined by the presence of fever and respiratory symptoms associated either with tachypnea (\u226530 min -1 ) or a low digital pulse oxymetry (<90%) at room air. 17 All patients fulfilling these criteria were reported on-line to a centralized surveillance system and nasopharyngeal swab samples are assessed, at local level, for the presence of influenza A-B, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, adenovirus and human metapneumovirus by indirect immunofluorescence using commercial reagents. Influenza A or B positive samples as well as all negative samples were referred to a reference laboratory (Instituto de Salud P\u00fablica: ISP) for further analyses using molecular techniques. Influenza virus was tested and sub typed with the molecular kit FluRUO-01, and non-influenza respiratory viruses using kit KK0812, provided by the CDC. The latter allows detection by PCR of adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, as well as rhinovirus (HRV), not included in the initial immunofluorescence panel. 18 For nucleic acid extraction we used the automated Easy Mag system from Biomerieux. Amplification was performed using Ag Path -ID kits from Ambion and a real time thermo cycler (Applied Biosystems). The results of a positive HRV detection were not available during hospitalization.",

Only influenza remained more important in our prospective study, as described previously. 36 Some authors have shown that HRV infections have the most prolonged seasonality among viral causes of pneumonia in adults, surpassing influenza, adenovirus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza. 3 Second, as indicated by others, HRV-associated hospitalization affected elderly and frail patients with chronic comorbidities and with a past or current history of smoking. 12, 33, 35 Third, admissions were relevant because they were prolonged, required intermediate or intensive care resources in nearly 30% of cases, and had a case fatality rate over 10%. This profile has been described in the literature and underscores the relevance of this viral agent. 3, 33, 34 As a way of comparison, mortality by seasonal or pandemic influenza A is similar. 3, 5 The proportion of HRV infected patients that requires hospitalization (\u223c2-10%) depends on the population studied and intensity of search. 3, 13, 25, 27, 35 In addition, HRV is more frequently encountered in symptomatic adult patients than in controls demonstrating its pathogenic relevance. 1, 2, 26 All of these facts indicate that HRV infections can no longer be considered a minor nuisance and its diagnostic search is justified.",

Some cases present as community-acquired pneumonia or as a decompensated chronic condition. Fever was not universal and, if present, was of low grade; upper respiratory illness was not a hallmark. Fifth, to the best of our knowledge, mortality risk factors have not been described for HRV infection in adults, 3,28,30,33,34 although a high severity score has been linked to pneumococcal co-infection. 3 The higher mortality registered for those with a CURB 65 \u2265 3 is in line with the original report of this scoring system 22 and provides evidence that it is a suitable approach for HRV infections even when patients do not have pneumonia. In fact, the AUC of the CURB-65 ROC analysis for the whole group and the pneumonia subgroup did not reveal differences, suggesting that the distinction between patients with and without respiratory infiltrates is perhaps not necessary in patients affected by HRV infections. On the other side, despite their severity at admission, nearly 40% of patients had a low score (<2) of CURB-65, and the specificity of a higher score was low to predict mortality (\u223c70%) indicating a limited utility as a surrogate marker of risk. CAP-PIRO score demonstrated to be uselessness and no cutoff calculation was attempted. The limitations observed with CURB-65 to recognize patients in need of admission were probably related to the infrequent presence of hypotension in most viral respiratory illness and to the fact that a low digital pulse oxymetry is not considered for risk evaluation. In this sense, the current criteria adopted by the Chilean Ministry of Health together with the Pan American Health Organization appears to be better adapted to recognize severely ill patients affected by respiratory viral diseases. 17 HRV infection appears associated to a wide spectrum of disease and is able to rapidly decompensate vulnerable patients as reflected by the relatively short symptomatic period before admission and the high rate of hospitalization at the first medical visit.",

            "text": "There are probably few distinctive clinical differences between viral and bacterial pneumonia in adults. Lobar condensation, leukocytosis and hyponatremia are more frequently described in patients with bacterial disease, but overlapping is common. 25, 37 In accordance with these reports, our patients were characterized by minor changes in these parameters and with a low frequency of consolidation. On the other hand, neutrophilia, lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein (\u2265100 mg/L) were frequent findings in this work. Neutrophilia has been commonly found in adult patients hospitalized with different agents of viral pneumonia but less frequently in influenza cases 3 ; lymphopenia has been described in patients with pandemic A (H1N1) influenza, SARS and metapneumovirus infection, 5,38-40 and CRP is increased in a fraction of patients admitted with influenza. 5 Unfortunately, the results of viral diagnoses were not available at the time of the study and could not be useful for de-escalation of antibiotic therapy or to suspend antiviral influenza therapy. Knowing of a specific viral etiology has been on one hand associated to a reduction in antibiotic consumption in patients with respiratory viral illness, but on the other hand, the presence of abnormal lung findings has prompted antibiotic continuation despite a recognized viral infection. 9 Moreover, the probability of viral-bacterial co-infection is another modulating factor that can influence antibiotic therapeutic decisions. Bacterial-viral co-infection rates are variable among patients with respiratory infections (range 4-17%) 3,25,27 and before a full array of rapid diagnostic techniques for etiological agents are available, 15 it would be difficult to curtail or de-escalate antibiotic consumption. An imperative effort on medical education will be necessary because a viral diagnosis, even with normal chest X-ray, is not considered by clinicians to be sufficient to stop antibiotics. 7 Emergence of antibiotic resistance and Clostridium difficile are on the verge of this diagnostic shortcoming.",

HRV can be detected some weeks after infection and can be amplified from respiratory samples generating a suboptimal specificity. 18, 41 However, these are universal limitations present across all studies, and do not invalidate the scientific evidence showing similar results in different scenarios. In addition, a systematic search for respiratory bacterial pathogens was not carried out in our study, making possible that part of the results be explained by co-infections as it was the case in at least two patients. We believe that this factor is rather secondary because some patients had negative blood cultures and the reported frequency of viral-bacterial co-infection is not high in the literature (<20%). 36 On the other hand, no viral-viral co-infection could be demonstrated in our patients making our findings unbiased by the contribution of other viral respiratory agents. The frequency of viral-viral co-infection appears to be low in adults with respiratory infections (<10%). 36 Finally, the results of this work were derived from stringent criteria for severity and they do not necessarily represent cases with mild disease.",
