About 70% of the total membranal phosphatidylcholine was in the outer leaflet, 33% of which was exposed and readily exchanged in intact synaptosomes while the remainder was exchangeable following osmotic shock. Permeabilization of the synaptic plasma membranes by overnight incubation in buffer or by saponin (<0.08%) exposed an additional 30% of phosphatidylcholine to exchange, presumably from the inner cytoplasmic leaflet. Phosphatidylcholine is therefore asymmetrically distributed in the synaptosomal plasma membrane, as it is in other plasma membranes.",

An aliquot of the extract was taken for determination of total lipid phosphorus (Bartlett, 1959) and another, dissolved in 10 ml of Quicksafe A (Zuisser Analytic, Frankfurt) was counted in a liquid scintillation counter (Beckmann LS 1801). The ~4C counts, corrected for 3H (non-specific sticking of SUV), indicated the amount of PC in the membrane which was exchanged for PC from the vesicles. The percent of total SPM PC in the exchangeable pool, assumed for intact synaptosomes to be PC in the outer monolayer, was calculated as described previously (Steck et al., 1976) . This calculation was based upon the total PC in the SPM (see synaptosomes and synaptic plasma membranes section) and the total mass (60% of PC in SUV) and specific activity of the exchangeable PC in the SUV, determined by complete exchange with multilammelar vesicles (Crain, 1982; Zilversmit and Hughes, 1976) , given that PCEP catalyzes a 1 for 1 exchange (Zilversmit and Hughes, 1976) of SUV PC for SPM-PC. Exchange in the absence of the PCEP was negligible, the values being between 0 0.5%.",

In the timecourse experiment illustrated in Fig. 2 , the maximal exchange reached was slightly lower than this mean, but still significantly higher than that in synaptosomes ( Fig. 1 ). In addition to reaching a higher maximal value, the time-course of PC exchange in SPM differs from that obtained with intact synaptosomes by showing more rapid exchange (Figs l and 2) .

            "text": "The specific PC exchange protein from beef liver catalyzes a mol/mol exchange of exposed PC in membranes for PC in an external source, such as SUV (Wirtz et al., 1976; Kamp et al., 1977; Zilversmit, 1984; Crain, 1990) . Using PCEP and intact synaptosomes we obtained data indicating that a pool of PC, comprising 33% of the total membrane PC, is exposed on the membrane surface and is readily available for exchange. A higher proportion of membranal PC, viz. about 70% of the total, is exchanged when synaptic plasma membranes, instead of intact synaptosomes, are used for exchange. We consider this 70% to represent the total of externally located PC, viz. both the pool which is readily exposed (33%) and an additional pool which, although at the membrane surface, becomes available to exchange only after the synaptosomes are osmolically shocked. The question may be asked whether the additional PC exchanged in SPM represents PC located at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. A number of findings, however, argue against this possibility. There is a known tendency of membranes to form vesicles following lysis, thus regaining impermeability to proteins if not necessarily to small solutes (Bodemann and Passow, 1972; Low et al., 1973; Bloj and Zilversmit, 1976) . Indeed, electron micrographs of SPM preparations show mainly closed structures (Fig. 3) . Further proof for the impermeability of SPM to a protein of the same size as the PCEP was provided by showing that [I'25]hGH (MR 22,000) is excluded from SPM preparations. Bloj and Zilversmit (1976) found that PC in the outer layer of resealed red cell ghosts reacts readily with exchange protein, though in intact red cells it does not. PC exchange in the latter condition required larger amounts of PCEP (Van Meer et al., 1980) . This resembles our data which indicate a better exposure of PC in SPM than in intact synaptosomes. For the preparation of SPM, the synaptosomes have to be osmotically shocked in conditions which favor the detachment of loosely bound proteins, i.e. low ionic strengths, mildly alkaline pH and presence of EDTA (Steck. 1974 ). This may result in a more loosely packed bilayer structure (Van Mcer et al., 1980) promoting additional exposure of PC in the outer half of the membrane, thus increasing the total to about 70%. The finding of 70% PC in the external leaflet of the SPM is close to the proportion of PC in the outer leaflet of other biological membranes (Bretcher, 1972 ; Gordesky and Marinetti, 1973 ; Op den Kamp, 1979) . Freysz et al, (1982) found, e.g., that about 75-80% of the PC is in the outer leaflet of brain microsomal vesicles.",

Saponins are naturally occurring glycosides with lytic activity, due to their property of forming complexes with cholesterol, thus leading to membrane permeabilization (Wassler et al., 1987) . It has been shown that the size of the molecules crossing the permeabilized membrane are a function of saponin concentration. In order to permeabilize platelets or hepatocytes to Ca '+, amounts of saponin well under 0,01% are sufficient (Tohmatsu et al., 1989; Burgess et al., 1983) . At 0.01% saponin, the LDH contents of hepatocytes is completely released indicating that proteins may cross the membrane (Wassler et al., 1987) . Permeabilization of membrane to proteins is not associated with membrane disorganization at saponin concentrations as high as 0.05%. Thus, 0.05% saponin did not release an integral protein marker enzyme from hepatocytes (Wassler et al., 1987) . At 0,05% saponin, an integral membrane protein could be digested with proteases from both sides of the membrane, while its buried part remained intact, showing that the hydrophobic core of the membrane was not disorganized (Rotier et al., 1984) .",
