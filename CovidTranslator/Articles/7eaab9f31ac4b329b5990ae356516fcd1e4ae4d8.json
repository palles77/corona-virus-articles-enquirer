The concentration of MDL 20,610 employed was in 50-fold excess of the ICs0 for RV 2.

            "text": "The effect of MDL 20,610 on RV 1A (actinomycin D-resistant) RNA synthesis was measured indirectly by determining the incorporation of [5-3H]uridine into a trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-insoluble cell fraction. Virion uncoating was monitored using neutral red photosensitized RV 1A. Detailed descriptions of these techniques have been published previously (Kenny et al., 1985; Kuchler, 1977; Torney et al., 1982) . The effect of MDL 20,610 on RV 1A penetration was examined by the method of Eggers et al. (1977) . Briefly, the growth medium was aspirated from HeLa cell cultures in 6-well plates and the monolayers washed once with 3.0 ml Hanks' Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS). Three cultures were used for each variable. After washing, 0.1 ml (52-54 PFU) virus was added to each monolayer and the cultures placed at 4\u00b0C for 25 min to allow for virus adsorption and to minimize virus penetration. At the end of this time all cultures, except the 0 time set (see Table 2 ), were placed at 37\u00b0C. The 0 time cultures were treated with 0.1 ml HBSS, optimally-diluted RV 1A antiserum, 2 ixg/ml MDL 20,610 or a mixture of antibody and MDL 20,610. After 30 rain at room temperature the supernatant fluids were aspirated and 2.0 ml agar overlay added. The same procedure was repeated for the virus pre-treated cultures incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30, 60 and 90 min. After agar overlay was added all cultures were incubated at 35\u00b0C for 3 days to allow for plaque development. To test the direct virucidal activity of MDL 20,610, RV 1A was incubated at 35-37\u00b0C for 4 h both in the presence and in the absence of 25 Ixg compound/ml. Surviving virus was assayed by the CPE endpoint assay. To determine the effect of MDL 20,610 on RV 2 pH stability, 475 txl stock virus (106.8 TCIDs0/0.1 ml) was added to a series of test tubes containing 500 ixl of a 0.2 M acetic acid/0.2 M sodium acetate buffer solution mixed to give a final pH of 5.0 (Tisdale and Selway, 1984) . The compound was then added as a 25 pxl aliquot of a 1.0 mg/ml stock suspension to give a final concentration of 25 ~xg/ml. Control tubes for each pH value received 25 Ixl maintenance medium. Sufficient test and control tubes were prepared so that samples could be assayed after 0, 15, 30, 45 and 60 rain incubation in a 37\u00b0C water bath. At each designated time interval test and control samples were immediately diluted 10-fold with ice cold maintenance medium and further 10-fold dilutions prepared in cold maintenance medium for CPE endpoint assay. To determine the effect of MDL 20,610 on RV 2 heat stability at pH 7.0, 975 Ixl stock virus (106.8 TCIDs0/0.1 ml) was added to a series of test tubes followed by the addition of 25 Ixl of a 1.0 mg/ml stock compound suspension or maintenance medium. For each test sufficient tubes were prepared so that samples could be assayed after 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 min incubation in a 56\u00b0C water bath. At the designated time intervals samples were diluted and assayed for infectivity as described above.",

A second set (conditions C and D) was exposed to light 3 h after virus challenge. The third set (conditions E through H) received no light exposure. All monolayers, except the compound (condition G) and cell (condition H) controls were thoroughly washed 3 h after virus challenge, agar overlay medium added, and the plaques allowed to develop. The photosensitivity of the RV 1A used in these studies is shown by the lack of plaque development in those cultures where light exposure was begun immediately after virus addition before uncoating could occur (conditions A and B). The amount of virus uncoated within 3-h inoculation in untreated virus control cultures (condition D) was found to be 71.4 to 88.9% of the amount generated in cultures never exposed to light (condition F). A 100% reduction in plaque development was observed in unexposed cultures maintained on 0.5 p+g MDL 20,610/ml throughout the duration of the test (condition G). In these experiments not all of the test compound could be removed by washing as shown in a comparison of conditions E and F (residual compound effect).

In addition, MDL 20,610 displays little effect on HeLa cell macromolecular synthesis when evaluated by isotope incorporation or by cloning efficiency (Kenny et al., 1986a) . In the present studies we examined the antirhinovirus mechanism of action of MDL 20,610. Analysis of the growth of RV 2 in compound-treated or untreated HeLa cells suggested that MDL 20,610 acts directly on infecting virions or at some early stage in the replicative cycle. Subsequently, it was found that the compound blocks viral (actinomycin D-resistant) RNA synthesis and the uncoating of neutral red photosensitized virions. In addition, it was demonstrated that MDL 20,610 is not directly virucidal, but stabilizes the virion against inactivation at 56\u00b0C and at pH 5.0. By comparison, the antirhinovirus compound 44 081 R.P. (Alarcon et al., 1986) and the antipicornavirus flavone Ro 09-0179 (Ishitsuka et al., 1982b) have also been shown to act on some early phase in the viral replicative cycle while the antirhinovirus 4',6-dichloroflavan BW683C (Tisdale and Selway, 1984) and the antipicornavirus compounds WIN 51711 (Fox et al., 1986; McKinlay, 1985; Otto et al., 1985) , Ro 09-0410 (Ishitsuka et al., 1982a; Ninomiya et al., 1984) , and arildone (McSharry et al., 1979) bind directly to infecting virions preventing the subsequent pH-mediated uncoating of viral RNA.",

Those studies indicate that virus uncoating may be inhibited by compound binding to the virion VP1 structural protein thus preventing collapse of the VP1 hydrophobic pocket or by blocking the flow of ions into the virus interior during uncoating. Such data are lacking for MDL 20,610 but compound-induced heat and low pH stabilization indicate direct virion binding and protein stabilization. Earlier studies by Dimmock (1967) have shown that RV inactivation above 39\u00b0C is due to the degradation of capsid protein. Compound BW683C has also been shown to stabilize RV against heat and low pH inactivation (Tisdale and Selway, 1984) . The cross resistance of MDL 20,610, MDL 055 and BW683C, the inability of MDL 20,610 to stabilize compound-resistance mutants as shown in our study, and the cross resistance demonstrated between arildone and BW683C (Tisdale and Selway, 1984) imply a common virion binding site for all four compounds. No such cross resistance was noted with the p-benzoylphenoxypyridine MDL 26,019, a compound previously shown to inhibit uncoating of neutral red-sensitized coxsackie A21 (Kenny et al., 1986b) .",
