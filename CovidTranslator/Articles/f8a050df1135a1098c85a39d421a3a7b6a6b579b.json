            "text": "Avian influenza virus causes outbreaks in domestic and wild birds around the world, and sporadic human infections have been reported. A DNA vaccine encoding hemagglutinin (HA) protein from the A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1) strain was initially tested in two randomized phase I clinical studies. Vaccine Research Center study 304 (VRC 304) was a double-blinded study with 45 subjects randomized to placebo, 1 mg of vaccine, or 4 mg of vaccine treatment groups (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 15/group) by intramuscular (i.m.) Biojector injection. VRC 305 was an open-label study to evaluate route, with 44 subjects randomized to intradermal (i.d.) injections of 0.5 mg by needle/syringe or by Biojector or 1 mg delivered as two 0.5-mg Biojector injections in the same deltoid or as 0.5 mg in each deltoid (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 11/group). Injections were administered at weeks 0, 4, and 8 in both studies. Antibody responses to H5 were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and neutralization assay, and the H5 T cell responses were assessed by enzyme-linked immunospot and intracellular cytokine staining assays. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events, and the vaccine was well tolerated in all groups. At 1 mg, i.d. vaccination compared to i.m. vaccination induced a greater frequency and magnitude of response by ELISA, but there were no significant differences in the frequency or magnitude of response between the i.d. and i.m. routes in the HAI or neutralization assays. T cell responses were more common in subjects who received the 1-or 4-mg dose i.m. These studies demonstrated that the DNA vaccine encoding H5 is safe and immunogenic and served to define the proper dose and route for further studies. The i.d. injection route did not offer a significant advantage over the i.m. route, and no difference was detected by delivery to one site versus splitting the dose between two sites for i.d. vaccine administration. The 4-mg dose (i.m) was further investigated in prime-boost regimens.",

In the early studies described here, we assessed the safety and immunogenicity of this H5 DNA product. The vaccine was administered as a three-dose regimen without a heterologous vaccine boost, similar to the regimens used to initially evaluate gene-based vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome, West Nile virus, and Ebola virus (9, (12) (13) (14) . In addition to intramuscular (i.m.) administration, we evaluated the potential impact of intradermal (i.d.) administration on immune response. Overall, the vaccine was well tolerated by both routes at all doses. The vaccine is immunogenic, but just as in previous H5N1 vaccine clinical trials, the overall responses were modest when H5 DNA was given without an inactivated vaccine boost. In further evaluations, this vaccine has shown promise as a prime for inactivated vaccine boosting (10) . These studies represented the first clinical studies with this product in humans and examined the safety and immunogenicity of this H5 investigational DNA vaccine encoding the HA from Influenza A/Indonesia/5/05 (H5N1), recommended by the World Health Organization as a clade 2.1 H5N1 candidate vaccine virus (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian _influenza/guidelines/summaryH520070403.pdf). Doses were administered intramuscularly (i.m.) and intradermally (i.d.) in the VRC 304 and VRC 305 studies, respectively, in healthy adults aged 18 to 60 years. The studies were reviewed and approved by the NIAID Institutional Review Board. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services human experimental guidelines for conducting clinical research were followed.",

The H5 antigen is generally less immunogenic than most seasonal influenza antigens and poses a difficult scientific challenge to vaccine researchers. This study demonstrates that this DNA vaccine encoding H5 is safe and immunogenic, but when given as a three-dose regimen without a heterologous boost it induces only modest immunogenicity. Not surprisingly, a dose effect was observed, in that 4 mg i.m. induced higher antibody and T cell responses compared to 1 mg i.m. or 0.5 or 1 mg i.d. In the VRC 305 study, one question focused on the distribution of dosing related to the question of split dosing in different limbs. Two groups received 1 mg i.d. divided into two doses. In one of those groups, both injections were administered in the same deltoid and in the other group, one injection was administered into each deltoid. In the present study, no significant differences were related to safety, antibody, or T cell responses between these two groups. These studies were important to establish the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine prior to its evaluation in a prime-boost regimen (at a dose of 4 mg i.m.), where more impressive immune responses were seen following H5N1-inactivated vaccine boosting (10) .",

Based on the impressive safety record and improvements in manufacturing and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines, as well as recent findings describing the significant impact of DNA priming on H5N1 monovalent inactivated vaccine boosting (10), further evaluation of DNA vaccines in prime-boost regimens toward improved influenza vaccination is warranted.",
