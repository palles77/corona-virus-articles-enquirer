The resulting hydrophobic molecular drug-organisers were fully characterized, and evaluated over two Gram negative and three Gram positive reference strains, using disk diffusion assays with disks impregnated with solution of title compound in pure DMSO.

            "text": "Due to their intrinsic physico-chemical and chemical properties, the calixarenes have often been employed, in the last years, as carriers and spatial organisers of various kinds of active substituent, displaying properties dealing with the recognition of organic substrates or metallic cations. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Such organising properties could be of great interest in the building of molecular drug-organisers or dispensers, notably as medically valuable structures incorporating probes and drugs; in the last case, a biochemically controlled release should be expected, resulting for such edifices in a drug-carrier or a prodrug behaviour. The resulting oligomeric structures could thus be considered as size-intermediate between discrete drugs and polymeric ones, the latter being emergent over the last 10 years, with the apparition of said polymer therapeutics 6 using polymeric drugs, 7 hybrid polymer drugs, 6, 8, 9 polymeric micelles containing covalently linked drugs. 10, 11 As recently reviewed by de Fatima et al, 12 and Kalchenko and coworkers 13 very few reports, essentially under the form of patents, describe therapeutical activities of calixarenes and derivatives; some of them, hydrophilic, have shown interesting activities against bacteria, 14 fungi, cancerous cells and enveloped viruses, 15 but also against thrombosis 16 or fibrosic diseases. 17 Biological studies related to plasmid DNA binding and cell transfection have been recently reported by Ungaro and co-workers. 18 In the middle 50's, the calixarene derivative 'Macrocyclon', 19a and more recently some parent structures, 19b-d have been studied in the treatment of tuberculosis and other mycobacterioses. Calixarene-based mimics of vancomycin has also been described. 20 In this field, our contribution has been devoted to the design of new anti-HIV 21 or anti-corona virus 22 agents and, with regards to spreading resistances of pathogenic microorganisms against actual antibiotics, 23 antibacterial 24-30 agents.",

In addition, the choice was done to introduce the penicillin moiety at the last step, in order to avoid degradation of this pH-sensitive unit. It was thus decided to prepare first the mono-bromopropylcalixarene 1, to alkylate it at the opposite position with bromopropyl nalidixate to obtain 2, then to introduce the penicillin moiety on the bromopropyl arm (Scheme 2).",

The reaction of 1 with bromopropylnalidixate, in the presence of 0.6 equiv of K 2 CO 3 in dry MeCN afforded the podand 2. Incorporation of the penicillin V onto the residual brominated arm was performed in dry DMF at 35\u00b0C, under inert atmosphere, by reacting 2 with an excess of potassium salt of penicillin V (PVK). The podand 3 that was formed was thus isolated pure after chromatography with a yield of 73%.

The silica gel was filtered off, rinsed with 25 mL of a 9:1 mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 and EtOH, and the combined filtrates were evaporated The semi-solid residue was dissolved in CH 2 Cl 2 and evaporated again until a solid material was obtained. The latter was triturated in dry Et 2 O (5 mL) then filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness, and the residue (0.2 g) was chromatographed (SiO 2 ; CH 2 Cl 2 :EtOH 99/1 then 97/3) to separate ethyl nalidixate and the desired diol as a semi-glassy material. The latter was triturated in a 66/33 mixture of pentane and Et 2 O to give the diol 4 (0.095 g, 62% ",
