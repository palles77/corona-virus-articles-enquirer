This is a rapid process and the neutrophil is the first cell to reach the affected location 14 . Neutrophil activation markers will be released from the neutrophils upon activation. These activation markers are stored in granulae or cytoplasm and can be rapidly released from the neutrophils 15 .

Performance of calprotectin was compared to performance of heparin binding protein (HBP) which also is produced in neutrophils but stored in the azurophil granules within the cells and procalcitonin (PCT) which is widely used as a marker for bacterial infections. We found significantly higher plasma calprotectin values in patients with bacterial respiratory infections (pneumonia, tonsillitis, or mycoplasma) than in patients with viral respiratory infections or healthy controls. The AUC for calprotectin and PCT were higher than the AUC for HBP when used for diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia, mycoplasma pneumonia and streptococcal tonsillitis (Fig. 2 , Table 3 ). Furthermore, the AUC for calprotectin was significantly higher than that for both PCT and HBP in discriminating mycoplasma infections from viral infections. These data support clinical use of calprotectin in diagnosis of respiratory infections and indicate greater performance of calprotectin compared to HBP and PCT in distinguishing bacterial and mycoplasma respiratory infections from viral infections. Our findings are supported by observations from other studies about the limited clinical utility of procalcitonin in diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia 16 . The response of calprotectin to bacterial respiratory infections is well in line with previous reports demonstrating increase in calprotectin in sepsis [17] [18] [19] [20] as well as other inflammatory conditions with neutrophil activation such as appendicitis, synovitis and prosthetic joint infections [21] [22] [23] .",

PCT should not be affected by the coagulation process and was thus analyzed in serum samples. The HBP assay is a microtiter-based ELISA which is associated with very long test turnaround times as the test format requires collection of a number of samples prior to testing. The available commercial procalcitonin assays are either microtiter based or developed for specific assay platforms and these platforms are not available in all laboratories. This means that the samples may have to be sent to another laboratory for testing which also increases the time until the test results are available. The calprotectin assay used was a particle enhanced turbidimetric assay (PETIA) with an assay time of 10 min. PETIA is a technology that can be applied on routine chemistry analyzers available at most hospital laboratories allowing short test turnaround times. In comparison with ELISA it is designed for measuring single samples, and thus, shortens the analysis times significantly. This is important as bacterial infections are acute condition that requires rapid test results. In conclusion, calprotectin and procalcitonin performed better than HPB in distinguishing between pneumonia and tonsillitis caused by bacteria and viral infections. Furthermore, calprotectin was superior to HBP and procalcitonin in distinguishing between respiratory infections caused by mycoplasma and viruses in primary care and infectious disease unit patients. Our results indicate that calprotectin is altogether more sensitive than HBP and procalcitonin in distinguishing bacterial and mycoplasma from viral cause of respiratory infections.",
