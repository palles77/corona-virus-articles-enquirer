When the nucleus contained only a few viral particles, they tended to be distributed towards the nuclear membrane, the central nuclear region being occupied by type I I inclusions. When the nucleus contained many viral particles, as shown in Fig. 3 , they tended to be located in closely packed groups in the centre of the nucleus where they formed paraerystalline arrays. These arrays were sometimes very large and composed of virions with a centre-to-centre spacing of 80 nm. Type I I inclusions were found between the arrays. Small spherical inclusions, approximately 0.5 to 1 ~zm in diameter, were also present. They consisted of a fine granular electron dense matrix (Fig. 3) and were mainly located at the boundary of the central nuclear region. They were designated type I inclusions. In addition, small, granular, highly electron dense inclusions were seen in close apposition to the paracrystalline arrays. These were termed type IV inclusions (Fig. 3) . Inclusions were not usually observed at the periphery-of highly infected nuclei. This zone was electron translucent containing only dispersed fine granular material and many viral particles. The latter were randomly distributed in this area. Rough granulo-fibrillar material, resembling ehromatin, was observed adhering to the nuclear envelope. In these infected cells the nucleolus was also usually located at the periphery of the nucleus. Both in the peripheral area and in the central part of these heavily infected nuclei, tubular structures ~dth a diameter of approximately 90 nm were occasionally seen (Fig. 4) . They had a thin moderately electron dense coat surrounding an inner highly electron dense tubule which was filled with fine granular material. The lenght of these tubules varied greatly. They were always observed in close association with type I I inclusions and with viral particles. The viral particles were of two types. The first had an electron dense core measuring approximately 50 nm surrounded by an outer eapsid. The second had a moderately electron dense core bounded by an inner electron dense shell which was separated from the capsid by a narrow clear space (Fig. 5) . The virions had an overall diameter of 65 nm. Empty particles with only a capsid shell were occasionally seen. Virions were found in the vicinity of type I I inclusions close to crescentlike structures which seemed to derive from the granulo-fibrillar material of the inclusion (Fig. 5) .",

This is the first in vivo study of the replication of a porcine adenovirus. The first ultrastructural change observed in the enterocytes of infected pigs was the appearance of type I I intranuelear inclusion bodies.

The one used here is comparable to that used for human adenovirus intranuelear inclusion bodies in tissue culture (18, 26) .
