The major recreational diver training agencies recorded 1,73,476 new diver certifications in 2003. Each certification supports dive travel, accommodation, equipment sales and a range of marine facilities. Despite this role the global industry is in something of a crisis where, after many years of sustained growth, certification rates for new divers show signs of decline (Dive Equipment Manufacturer's Association, 2004).",

Some larger companies have developed separately marketed and operated vessels to deal with this. Some of the major tourist diving operational types are shown in Table 14 .2. The tourist diving industry is both internally and externally competitive, with aggressive marketing both domestically and overseas. The industry is very price driven with many operators offering similar products and customers easily able to substitute one dive product for another.

However, the rounded figures quoted (to the nearest 500 or 1000), indicate that the calculations are approximations. The mortality rate concluded by this study was an extremely low 1 per 4,30,000 (or 0.23 per 1,00,000) dives in Queensland. Unfortunately, this study has not been updated or externally corroborated. Even the national rate (for drownings of divers only) is only marginally lower, 0.08 per 1,00,000 of the overall population (Australian Water Safety Council, 1998).",

The preponderance of admissions of overseas visitors to Queensland hospitals for water-related injuries has been noted (Wilks, Coory, & Pendergast, 2004) . This study showed that, for the three financial years 1998/1999-2000/2001, 59 .6% of these admissions (162 patients) were using diving equipment. Of the diving incidents, the dominant cause of admissions was for decompression illness, accounting for 54.8% (149 patients). Sadly, comparisons with an earlier study (Wilks & Coory, 2000) conducted for the previous 3-year period (1995/1996-1997/1998 ) revealed that decompression illness continued to be the main condition treated, and that the proportion of patients treated had not changed over 6 years. This led the authors to recommend that scuba diving safety in Queensland requires further targeted attention. Specifically, that it is important to know which international visitor groups are experiencing problems and whether education and injury prevention initiatives are being delivered appropriately and in the correct languages.",

This regulation marked the beginning of a succession of evolving standards for the recreational dive and snorkelling industry, summarised in Table 14 .4. This original regulatory part prescribed standards for dive equipment, air purity, equipment available on dive vessels and operational requirements to be ensured by the dive master. In some cases the regulations can now only be described as arbitrary, where the outcome appears to have more to do with measuring compliance than improving health and safety. For example, regulation 264(3) (j) limits any diver to undertaking no more than four dives in any 1 day. As a control measure to limit the risk of a diver developing decompression illness this control is demonstrably illogical in that there is no reference to individual dive profiles.",
