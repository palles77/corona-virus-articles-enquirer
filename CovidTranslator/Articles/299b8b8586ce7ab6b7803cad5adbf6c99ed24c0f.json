More recently, specialized B cell helpers, known as follicular helper T (T FH ) cells, and the pro-inflammatory T H 17 cell subset, have been described.

APC activation is achieved by recognition of conserved elements of microbial products by APC-expressed pattern recognition receptors (PRR), which include Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs). Signaling via PRRs leads to the upregulation of MHC class II, costimulatory molecules, such as CD80 and CD86, and inflammatory cytokines that are involved in APC-mediated stimulation of T cells. TLRs and CLRs expressed on the surface of APCs, such as TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, TLR11, dectin-1, dectin-2, and MINCLE, as well as PRRs located within endosomes, such as TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9, recognize products of diverse viral pathogens. Other recognition receptors, RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2) and NLRs (NOD1, and NOD2) react to signatures of pathogens in the cytoplasm, the former reacting to RNA viruses and the latter to various microbial and viral PAMPs as well as to cellular stresses that can be triggered by infection 5 .",

PRR ligation promotes APC activation and migration to draining lymph nodes for na\u00efve CD4 + T cells activation, the first step in generating primary antiviral T cell responses (FIGURE 1). The efficiency of this process, especially in immunologically na\u00efve hosts, can determine whether viral replication or T cell expansion, differentiation, and the elaboration of adaptive immunity, gains an upper hand. The priming environment can vary dramatically in different viral infections due to variables such as the route of exposure, viral dose, and the organ or cell types targeted. As extensively reviewed elsewhere, the subset of APC activated, such as plasmacytoid versus conventional dendritic cells (DCs) 7, 8 the level of antigen and duration of presentation 9 , and the patterns and amounts of cytokines produced by the different APC 10 can all impact the extent of expansion of adaptive immune cells and their subset specialization.",

Nevertheless, the CD4 + effectors generated in response to viral infection are mainly T H 1-like, characterized by strong IFN-\u03b3 production, which classically depends on exposure to high levels of IL-12 and type I IFNs in the priming milieu 11 . There are, however, several examples of intact T H 1 responses generated in response to certain viruses independently of IL-12 or type I IFN [12] [13] [14] , suggesting that other factors can also contribute to the generation of the T H 1 phenotype. These virally induced innate mediators repress development of other polarized T H cell subsets, intensifying T H 1 cell polarization, and even affect already polarized effector cells. For example, transfer of polarized T H 2 cells to hosts that are infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitus virus (LCMV) leads to development of a mixed T H 1/T H 2 phenotype 7 days after infection that is characterized by strong IFN-\u03b3 production and diminished IL-4 production. Interestingly, the majority of IFN-\u03b3 producing cells in this 'mixed' T H 1/T H 2 cell population also produced IL-4 or IL-13, and in vitro   experiments found that IL-12 and type I IFNs were critical in driving the cells to this mixed  T H 1/T H 12 phenotype 15 . IL-12 can also override responses by already polarized T H 17 cells  in vitro and in vivo to generate effector CD4 + T cells that closely resemble T H 1 cell   populations 16, 17 . In addition, viral infection leads to production of anti-inflammatory factors, such as IL-10 and TGF-\u03b2, from innate immune cells and this can also suppress the generation of antiviral T H 17-polarized responses 18 .",

Thus the predominance of T H 1 over T H 2 responses against viral pathogens was somewhat surprising given the generation of neutralizing antibody that is important for viral clearance and long-term immunity. However, adoptive transfer of T H 1 cells, as well as transfer of T H 2 cells, was shown to provide efficient help for the generation of anti-viral IgG responses 19, 20 . The signature T H 1-type cytokine IFN-\u03b3 enhances IgG2a class-switching responses, explaining why IgG2a is usually the dominant isotype in IgG responses generated against viruses 21 . In fact, several studies have found that, far from promoting antiviral responses, T H 2 cell-associated mediators, and IL-4 in particular, have a strong negative impact on protection, and drive immunopathology during infection with many viruses, including influenza virus 18, 22 , respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 23 , herpes simplex virus (HSV) 24 and vaccinia virus 25 .",

The generation of polarized T H 17 cells during virus infection has been correlated with high levels of IL-6 that are produced in response to virus and may also be influenced by TGF-\u03b2 29 . T H 17 cells are implicated in driving excessive inflammation during autoimmunity, and IL-17 may contribute to immunopathology during responses against viruses, as demonstrated in studies using influenza virus and vaccinia virus 28, 30 . However, in some cases T H 17 cells can contribute to protection against viruses 17 . One protective mechanism mediated by T H 17 cells might be the promotion of enhanced neutrophil responses at sites of infection. IL-17 upregulates CXC-chemokines that promote neutrophil recruitment 31 and neutrophils have been demonstrated to contribute to protection against certain viruses, including influenza virus 32 . We expect other functions will be indentified in future studies as well, considering that T H 17 cells often produce significant levels of IL-21 and IL-22 in addition to IL-17 17 . Although not extensively studied in viral systems, IL-22 production from T H 17 cells could be involved in regulating the expression of defensins, and could also play an important role in tissue repair (reviewed in 33 ). IL-21 production may also regulate aspects of innate responses during viral infection and is involved in sustaining CD8+ T cell responses during chronic viral infection, as will be discussed.",

Antibody-mediated protection can be extraordinarily long-lived 34 and neutralizing antibodies present at the time of pathogen encounter can prevent rather than combat infection, achieving 'sterilizing' immunity. Thus, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms by which CD4 + T cells help B cells during viral infection to define what is required for effective vaccination (FIGURE 2a). CD4 + T cells that enter B cell follicles and provide help to B cells resulting in germinal center (GC) formation are now referred to as follicular helpers, T FH cells. The generation and detailed functional capabilities have been expertly reviewed elsewhere 35, 36 , so we will focus on their role during viral infection.",

CD4 + T cells have been shown to be required for the generation of optimal antibody responses following infection with corona virus 40 , vaccinia virus 41 , yellow fever virus 42 , and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) 43 though a direct association with Tfh subsets is not yet clear. In acute LCMV and influenza infection, SAP (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM) -associated protein) expression in T cells is necessary to direct T FH cell-dependent formation of germinal centers 37, 38 and is required for the generation of B cell memory and long-lived IgG antibody following viral challenge 37, 39 . How other distinct cytokine-polarized CD4 + T cell subsets contribute to B cell responses during primary viral infection. One possibility is that distinct T H cell subsets, such as T H 1, T H 2, and T H 17 cells, can each develop into T FH cells and provide efficient help for B cells. This hypothesis is supported by a recent study demonstrating that such polarized subsets can be reprogrammed to express T FH characteristics in vitro 44 . The often-broad spectrum of isotypes present in long-lived virusspecific antibody in individuals with immunity to a virus favors such a model. Several costimulatory ligands expressed by CD4 + T cells contribute to promoting B cell activation and antibody production. One notable ligand is CD40L. Interactions between CD40, expressed on B cells, and CD40L, expressed on activated CD4 + T cells are crucial for generating optimal humoral responses against several viral pathogens, including LCMV, Pichinde virus, VSV, HSV, and influenza virus 45-47 . ICOS expression by T FH cells has also been shown to be important for germinal center formation 35 and studies have shown that ICOS expression is required for optimal primary humoral responses against LCMV, VSV, and influenza virus 48 . The role of other costimulatory molecules expressed by T FH cells is less clear during viral infection. For example, OX40-deficient mice generate normal levels of class-switched antibody during responses against LCMV, VSV, and influenza virus 49 . Further studies are required to determine the importance of additional signals passing between T FH cells and B cells for generating timely antibody responses during viral infection and in the formation of long-lived antibody-secreting cells and memory B cells that provide enduring protection.",

            "text": "CD4 + T cell help for the initial generation of CD8 + T cell responses and the survival of memory CD8 + T cells is not as well understood as their roles in B cell help. In parallel to B cell help, however, CD40L -CD40 interactions between CD4 + T cells and APCs are crucial (FIGURE 2b). It has been suggested that this APC-mediated mode of help by CD4 + T cells for CD8 + T cells is of minor importance during viral infection because APCs are activated effectively by viruses through PRRs 50, 51 , hence replacing the need for CD4 + T cellmediated 'licensing' 51,52, 53 . Whether activation of APCs through PRRs, targeting TLRs, for example, results in identical licensing of APCs as through activation by CD4 + T cells is not clear 54 . The generation of primary CTL responses against vaccinia virus 55 , HSV 56 and influenza virus in some 57, 58 but not all studies 59 have been found to be compromised in the absence of CD4 + T cells, indicating that they may not be. The difference between viruses that are dependent or not on CD4 + T cell help for the generation of optimal effector CD8 + T cell responses may depend on what elements of the inflammatory environment are triggered after infection and to what degree. For example, the strong type I IFN response induced by polyI:C administration can bypass the otherwise obligate requirement for CD4 + T cell help in the generation of CD8 + T cell responses upon vaccinia virus infection 60 . It is not clear whether different cytokine-polarized CD4 + T cells play distinct roles in mediating CD8 + T cell help. During the primary response, CD4 + T cell-driven APC licensing likely occurs before the full polarization of CD4 + T cell effectors, but fully polarized effectors could also promote efficient CD8 + T cell responses against viral pathogens through means other than licensing APCs. For example, chemokines produced upon antigen-specific interactions between DC and CD4 + T cells can actively attract CD8 + T cells to activated APCs 61 , and CD40-CD40L interactions between CD4 + T cells and APCs can protect the latter from CTLmediated death 62 , perhaps leading to more efficient CD8 + T cell priming.",

A recent study suggests that expression of the transcription factor eomesodermin, but not T-bet, is critical in driving the development of cytotoxic function in CD4 + T cells in vivo 96 . Thus, CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic activity may be a separate subset defined by function, and in that sense more akin to T FH cells. That MHC II expression is largely restricted to professional APC under steady state conditions could limit the protective potential of virus-specific cytotoxic CD4 + T cells to infections that target these populations. However, multiple cell types are capable of expressing MHC II following pathogen challenge, dramatically increasing the potential for cytotoxic CD4 + T cells to impact the outcome of viral infection. For example, epithelial cells activated through infection 97 or through IFN-\u03b3 signals 98 can strongly upregulate MHC II.",

A subset of T H 1 cells has been found to transiently co-produce IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 at the peak of the effector CD4 + T cell response in many models of infectious disease 100 . Several signals have been found to stimulate the generation of IL-10-producing effector CD4 + T cells, including high levels of antigen, soluble factors including IL-12 and IL-27, and costimulatory signals including ICOS (reviewed in 100 ). IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine but is most often associated with anti-inflammatory or inhibitory properties during strong immune responses (FIGURE 3). The impact of IL-10 production by effector CD4 + T cells is complicated and can be variable, especially in situations where strong immune responses, capable of serious immunopathology, are required to eliminate a rapidly replicating pathogen. For instance, the absence of IL-10 during influenza virus infection can lead on one hand to improved survival, due to enhanced T cell 17 and antibody responses 101 , or on the other, to exacerbated inflammation and immunopathology, leading to increased mortality 102 . Similarly, ablating IL-10 has been found to enhance protection against WNV 103 and vaccinia virus 104 , but to lead to increased pathology upon infection with RSV 105 , and death upon infection with mouse hepatitis virus 106 and corona virus 107 . Finally, as well as producing IL-10 themselves, effector CD4 + T cells can also promote IL-10 production by effector CD8 + T cells during virus infection 108 .",

The majority of studies assessing the impact of T Reg cells during viral infection have concentrated on models of chronic infection and in such settings T Reg cells have been found, depending on the particular pathogen, to have both beneficial roles, such as limiting collateral tissue damage, and detrimental roles, including diminishing the overall magnitude of antiviral immune responses 109 . The antigenspecificity of T Reg cells in the context of infectious disease has not been addressed often, but it is likely that T Reg cell populations contain at least some virus-specific cells, and that these populations are generated in concert with anti-viral effector T cell responses, as has recently been demonstrated in a corona virus model 110 . The accumulation of virus-specific Foxp3 + T Regs during viral infection could be due to expansion of pre-existing 'natural' T Regs specific for viral antigen or could also reflect the generation of Foxp3 + T Reg from conventional CD4 + T cell precursors (adaptive or induced T Reg ). An important factor in this conversion is TGF-\u03b2 111 . How induced T Regs impact viral infection is not well understood, but evidence from studies with human CD4 + T cells and HIV suggests that viral infection can enhance Foxp3 expression through a TGF-\u03b2-dependent mechanism 112 . This finding and others suggests that some viral pathogens may promote the differentiation of various regulatory T cell populations to further their own goals. Evidence for this hypothesis is found in several models of mostly chronic viral infection 113, 114 . Although less studied, during acute viral infection, T Reg cells have been shown to limit pathology upon WNV 115 , RSV 116, 117 , and in a model of IAV infection 118 . A detailed account of T Reg induction and responses during viral infection infection is beyond the scope of this review but has been discussed elsewhere 119 .",

However, the impact of persistent virus infection on CD4 + T cell function, and the importance of CD4 + T cells during chronic viral infection are receiving increasing attention. During persistent infection with LCMV Clone 13, responding CD4 + T cells lose the abilities to produce T H 1-associated effector cytokines and to respond optimally following virus rechallenge 121 . The loss of function of CD4 + T cells responding to persistent antigen is likely driven by high levels of antigen following the priming phase 122 and seems not to be regulated by intrinsic changes in APCs that are caused by chronic viral pathogens 121 . Chronic infection may not lead to complete exhaustion of responding CD4 + T cells. For example, functionally impaired CD4 + T cells have been observed in HIV patients, and treatment with antibody stimulating CD28 123 , blocking TIM-3 124 or blocking PD-1 signalling 125 dramatically increased their proliferative potential in vitro. Also, a recent study by Fahey et al. found that during chronic LCMV infection responding CD4 + T cells progressively adopt a functional T FH -polarized phenotype 126 . That CD4 + T cells may retain specific functions during chronic infection helps to explain earlier observations that persistent LCMV infection is eventually cleared through mechanisms that are dependent on CD4 + T cells (BOX 2) . These findings and others (reviewed in 137, 138 ) have important implications in the design of vaccines and treatments against viruses that result in chronic infection of humans including HIV and hepatitis B and C and hence deserve further analysis.",

This population of CD4 memory decays with time and may require boosting . It is unclear which responding CD4 + T cell effectors transition to memory but a recent study suggests that those with decreased expression of Ly6c and T-bet have greater potential to do so 139 . A quantitative gain in antigen-specific T cells represents one important advantage of the memory state but memory CD4 + T cells also differ from na\u00efve T cells by broad functional criteria. Several of these attributes of memory CD4 + T cells allow them to respond much faster and more vigorously than na\u00efve CD4 + T cells upon pathogen challenge 140 . Additionally, subpopulations of memory CD4 + T cells have wider trafficking patterns and some are retained at or near sites of previous infection 141 , which contributes to their ability to be rapidly activated upon local reinfection. Tissue tropism and/or retention of tissue-resident memory CD4 + T cells may depend on specific interactions between adhesion molecules and their receptors",

Within 48 hours of intranasal influenza virus infection, antigen-specific memory CD4 + T cells cause an enhanced inflammatory response in the lung, characterized by the upregulation of a wide array of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines 147 (Figure 4) . T H 1-and T H 17-polarized memory cells, as well as memory CD4 + T cells generated by previous infection strongly induce expression of a cohort of these molecules including IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12p40, CCL2, CXCL9, and CXCL10. In contrast, T H 2-polarized and unpolarized (T H 0) memory T cells have a minimal impact on pulmonary inflammation following influenza virus challenge. Memory CD4 + T cell induction of innate inflammatory responses requires recognition of antigen on CD11c + APCs, which become activated during interaction with memory CD4 + T cells resulting in their upregulation of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules, and which contribute to the subsequent innate inflammatory response through production of factors such as IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2.

One possibility is that the more robust protection observed in models of viral disease seen when memory CD4 + T cells are present or introduced is that the secondary effectors generated from memory CD4 + T cells may be much more efficient than the primary effectors generated from naive cells in directly combating pathogens. Our recent experiments directly comparing such effectors upon influenza infection support such a view (Strutt, McKinstry, Bradley, Swain, unpublished observations). We find that upon transfer of equal numbers of memory or na\u00efve CD4 + T cell precursors specific for influenza, the secondary effectors that develop upon viral challenge contain higher frequencies of multiple cytokine producing cells (IFN\u03b3+, TNF + , IL-2 + ) and reach higher numbers than corresponding primary effectors. Furthermore, while strong IL-10 production characterizes primary CD4 + T cell effector responses against influenza, secondary effectors produce dramatically reduced IL-10 168 . Thus, secondary CD4 + T cells seem to give rise to a spectrum of secondary effector T cells that are distinct from primary effectors derived from na\u00efve precursors and we predict that this will result in distinct regulation of protective recall responses. We also suggest that further functions of secondary effectors will be discovered as more comparative analyses are done.",

Several key principles emerge. The various distinct CD4 + T cells subsets, including T H 1 cells, T H 17 cells, T FH cells and those effector CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic functions, each play important roles in the antiviral response. Key among these is the provision of help to B cells, well known to be critical for antibody production and for the generation of long-lived plasma cells and memory B cells. However, CD4 + T cell effector roles of direct cytotoxicity and cytokine and chemokine secretion at the site of infection and the ability to enhance CD8 responses, suggest multiple additional functions which we suggest can synergize with each other and provide more robust immunity by doing so.",

Moreover, certain cytokines, for example, IL-10, can be produced by subpopulations of cells within multiple effector subsets. Finally, successful clearance of viral pathogens in particular often depends upon complex CD4 + T cell responses encompassing multiple T H cell subsets that are capable of mediating direct anti-viral functions, of providing help for B cells, of regulating immunopathology, and of mediating cytotoxic killing of virally infected cells. CD4 + T cells with cytotoxic activity have been described in a number of models of viral disease as well as in the clinic. Upon restimulation, memory CD4 + T cells retain their previous effector functions and rapidly produce effector cytokines.

Recent studies employing LCMV suggest that IL-21 production by CD4 + T cells during chronic infection is critical in maintaining functional CD8 + T cells that are able to contain the infection [131] [132] [133] .

The nature of the viral infection as well as PRR ligation can influence the activation status of antigen-bearing APC and the Th-polarizing environment. Na\u00efve CD4 + T cell recognition of antigen on activated APCs during viral infection predominately results in the generation of T H 1 cells due to the presence of type I IFNs and IL-12, however, T H 17, T H 2 and T reg cell populations are also generated to some degree in certain viral infections. The best characterized pathway for CD4 + T cell help in the generation of CD8 + T cell effectors is through the activation (licensing) of APC via CD40L: CD40 interactions, and the provision of IL-2. A role for CD4 + T cell help in the initial generation of antiviral CD8 + T cell effector responses is often not clear, presumably because viruses can trigger PRRs and independently activate APC. However, a clear role for CD4 + T cell help in the generation of function of memory CD8 + T cells has been demonstrated upon infection with viruses. Down-regulation of TRAIL on CD8 + T cells is a prominent feature of 'helped' CD8 + T cells and at least in part facilitates their robust recall response during secondary infection. Virus-specific memory CD4 + T cells can directly activate DCs through the recognition of antigen presented by MHC class II molecules, even in the absence of costimulation delivered via PRR-mediated signaling. The critical signals delivered by memory CD4 + T cells to DC in this process are unclear and could involve both cell surface interactions and cytokine signals. The outcome of DC activation and initiation of inflammatory responses are similar whether triggered through PRR or memory CD4 + T cells, but in situations of infection with a rapidly replicating virus such as influenza, memory CD4 + T cell-mediated enhancement of innate immunity is substantially quicker and more effective.",

Production of IL-10 by effector CD4 + T cells can have a profound consequence on the outcome of viral infection (b) IFN-\u03b3, TNF, and other cytokines produced by CD4 + T cells help to coordinate an antiviral state in infected tissues.

Triggering of PRR at the site of infection induces local inflammation, involving the activation of several innate cellular populations that can control viral titers and establish chemokine gradients to call in further antiviral effector cells. The efficiency of PRR triggering can determine whether viral replication or protective immunity gain an upper hand. (b)",
