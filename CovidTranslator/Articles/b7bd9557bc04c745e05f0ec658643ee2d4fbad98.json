This allotrope of carbon comprises layers of six-atom rings in a honeycombed network and can be conceptually viewed as a true planar aromatic macromolecule [8] . As a basic building block of other carbon allotropes, graphene can be wrapped to generate 0D fullerenes, rolled up to form 1D carbon nanotubes, and stacked to produce 3D graphite [9] ( Figure 1a ). Although graphene is the fundamental basis of different carbon forms, it was first prepared unambiguously in 2004, 440 years after the invention of graphite, by peeling a single layer of graphene using sticky tape and a pencil [10] . During the past several years, various methods for producing graphene have been developed, such as micromechanical exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition, epitaxial growth, and chemically synthesis (see Box 1 for more details). Graphene samples produced by chemical method are also called chemically modified graphene (CMG). Here, we use graphene and graphene-based nanomaterial to define the graphene materials referred to in this review.",

Graphene has been employed as a substrate to be interfaced with various biomolecules and cells ( Figure 2 ). Biological modification in turn benefits graphene by improving its biocompatibility, solubility and selectivity. Hence, several studies have focused on graphene modification and functionalization (reviewed in [22] ). For the purpose of this review, biofunctionalization approaches for graphene are separated into two categories: functionalization with DNA and proteins. Tandem functionalization with DNA and protein, as well as functionalization with other biomolecules is also briefly mentioned. Graphene is a 2D building material for carbon materials of all other dimensionalities. It can be wrapped up into 0D buckyballs, rolled into 1D nanotubes, or stacked into 3D graphite [12] . (b) Schematic image representing the loading of doxorubicin (DOX) and camptothecin (CPT) onto FA-modified NGO. The NGO is functionalized with sulfonic acid groups to form NGO-SO 3 H, which render it stable in physiological solution. NGO-FA was prepared through formation of an amide bond by the reaction between the NH 2 groups of FA and COOH groups of NGO-SO 3 H. Finally, two anticancer drugs, DOX and CPT were conjugated onto the FA-NGO via p-p stacking and hydrophobic interactions [68] . (c) Electronic dispersion in graphene. Left: energy spectrum (in units of t) for finite values of t and t 0 , with t=2.7 eV and t 0 = -0.2t. Right: magnified image of energy bands close to one of the Dirac points [11] . (d) PEG modification of NGO: photos of (i) GO and (ii) NGO-PEG in different solutions recorded after centrifugation at 10 000 times gravity for 5 min. GO crashed out slightly in PBS and completely in cell medium and serum (top panel). NGO-PEG was stable in all solutions; Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of (iii) GO and (iv) NGO-PEG [66] .

Importantly, ssDNA can be strongly interfaced onto the graphene surface. In particular, the tethering process of ssDNA on graphene is preferential on thicker sheets ($8 nm), and on wrinkled rather than flat surfaces of chemically modified graphene. Patterning ssDNA on graphene layers increases the hole-density in the graphene layer in the order of 5.61\u00c210 12 /cm 2 . The resultant ssDNA-graphene biointerface has been used in a field-effect transistor (FET) for the label-free, reversible detection of complementary ssDNA [40] . Through a self-assembly process under strong ultrasonication, monolayers of ssDNA molecules have been adsorbed on both sides of graphene sheets by p-p stacking [41] . In another example, graphene adsorbed with ssDNA Box 1. Methods for production of graphene and graphene-based nanomaterials Graphene was first prepared in 2004 by peeling a single layer of graphene using sticky tape and a pencil [10] . During the past several years, various methods for producing graphene have been developed, such as micromechanical exfoliation, epitaxial growth or chemical vapour deposition (CVD) epitaxial growth, and chemical synthesis from graphite. The sticky tape and pencil strategy is also considered as the micromechanical exfoliation or peel-off method, which can be used successfully against the strong exfoliation energy of the p-stacked layers in graphite, to produce pure and single-layered graphene sheets with a honeycomb lattice. However, this process has a disadvantage in terms of yielding small samples. A method of liquid phase exfoliation of graphite in surfactant/water solutions has been demonstrated recently. This method produces graphene that consists of 40% of sheets thinner than five layers and about 3% monolayers [70] .",

However, the chemical approach does introduce some defects in graphene during the oxidation or reduction steps, and results in structural damage of the graphene. Hence, graphene produced by chemical methods is also called CMG in some reports and reviews [73] . Here, we use the terms graphene and graphene-based nanomaterial. Briefly, the chemical method for graphene production involves initial oxidation of graphite to graphite oxide, followed by mechanical or thermal exfoliation of graphite oxide to GO sheets. GO sheets are hydrophilic, oxygenated graphene sheets and graphite oxide is a layered material that consists of GO sheets, which bear oxygen functional groups on their basal planes and edges. To derive graphene from GO, chemical reduction is the final step to remove the functional groups, which makes the product strongly hydrophilic. Reduction of GO to graphene can be carried out by using reducing chemical agents such as hydroquinone, dimethylhydrazine and hydrazine hydrate, electrochemical reduction [74] , thermal reduction [75] , and photocatalytic reduction [76] .

FRET involves the transfer of energy from a donor fluorophore to an acceptor fluorophore, and is one of the advanced tools available for measuring nanometer-scale distance and changes, both in vivo and in vitro [51] . Recent theoretical and experimental studies have shown that graphene can be a highly efficient quencher for various organic dyes and quantum dots (QDs) [13] . Compared with organic quenchers, graphene has shown superior quenching efficiency for a variety of fluorophores, with low background and high signal-to-noise ratio, as well as other advantages derived from the nanomaterial itself, such as protection from enzymatic cleavage [52, 53] . Graphene and GO have been reported to interact strongly with NAs through p-p stacking interactions between the ring structures in the NA bases and the hexagonal cells of graphene and GO; whereas double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) cannot be stably adsorbed onto the surface because of efficient shielding of nucleobases within the negatively charged dsDNA phosphate backbone [54, 55] . The development of graphenebased FRET biosensors has been motivated greatly by reliance on this particular principle and integrating it with the advantages of graphene. Here, we selectively summarize recent progress in biosensors that integrate the super quenching property of graphene and the recognition properties of NAs (Table 1) .",

As a result of the FRET effect between FAM and GO, fluorescence is quenched rapidly; however, binding between probe ssDNA and a complementary ssDNA alters the conformation, and consequently, releases FAM-ssDNA from the GO surface and results in fluorescence recovery. Detection of cDNA is therefore realized. Similarly, multicolor DNA analysis has been accomplished with graphenebased FRET biosensors [56] . The planar GO surface allows simultaneous quenching of multiple ssDNA probes labeled with different dyes, which leads to a multicolor sensor for the detection of multiple DNA targets. In this case, a graphene-based FRET biosensor is able to detect different DNA targets with various sequences by using ssDNA probes with different sequences. In another example, a graphene-based FRET platform has been developed for detection of helicase-mediated unwinding of duplex DNA [55] . By reliance on the preferential binding of GO to ssDNA over dsDNA, the dsDNA substrate that contains a fluorescent dye at the end of one strand is prepared first. As helicase unwinding of dsDNA proceeds, the fluorescence decreases and is quenched completely because of strong interaction of GO with unwound ssDNA. Helicase activity can thus be monitored in real time.",

By using aptamers as probes, we can extend the targeting field of graphene-based FRET biosensors from DNA to ions, small molecules, and proteins. Ag + ion detection has been realized by using GO and an Ag + -specific aptamer [60] . The target-induced conformational change of the aptamer leads to the recovery of FAM fluorescence. Ag + ions can be easily differentiated when some other metal ions are present with a 10-fold higher concentration, which demonstrates a sensitive responding ability of the proposed graphene FRET biosensor. Another highly specific FRET sensor has been developed for detection of bovine thrombin, based on a dye-labeled aptamer probe and graphene [54, 61] . To obtain a good water-dispersion graphene sample, sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) has been used for the chemical reduction of graphite oxide to produce SDBS-graphene [61] . Thrombin aptamer labeled with FAM was first incubated with SDBS-graphene. When thrombin was introduced into the aptamer/graphene solution, obvious fluorescence recovery was observed. This is mainly due to the quadruplex structure formed by thrombin and its aptamer, which owns the weak affinity to graphene. The graphene-based FRET aptasensor has a sensitive detection ability for thrombin in buffer (down to 31.3 pM) and in serum solutions ( Table 1 ). The graphene-based FRET aptasensor has exhibited an extraordinary response in buffer and serum solutions.",

For instance, modified GO has been investigated as a cargo for the delivery of water-soluble cancer drugs [66] . Nanoscale GO (NGO) was first functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to render high solubility in aqueous solutions, as well as stability in physiological solutions, such as serum. A water-insoluble aromatic molecule, SN38, has been attached to PEGylated NGO (NGO-PEG). Finally, the NGO-PEG-SN38 complex exhibits high potency with IC 50 values of 6 nM for HCT-116 human colon cancer cells, which is 1000-fold more potent than camptothecin (CPT-11), and has similar potency to that of free SN38 [67] . To enhance the loading efficiency and targeting ability of anticancer drugs, NGO can be covalently modified with folic acid (FA) [68] . Controlled loading of two anticancer drugs, doxorubicin and CPT-11 onto the FA-conjugated NGO (FA-NGO) has been investigated. In this case, FA-NGO loaded with the two anticancer drugs shows specific targeting to MCF-7 human breast cancer cells and remarkably high cytotoxicity compared to unmodified NGO loaded with doxorubicin or irinotecan. In a final example, PEGmodified nanoscale graphene sheets (NGSs) have been prepared, and the strong optical absorbance of NGSs in the near-infrared region has been utilized to achieve ultra-high in vivo tumor uptake of anticancer drugs, which can be used for photothermal therapy of cancer [69] . The behavior of PEGylated NGSs in mice has been studied by fluorescence imaging, and surprisingly high tumor accumulation was observed. NGSs with a biocompatible coating might therefore constitute a novel type of 2D nanomaterial with great potential in cancer therapy. With the success of the above studies, it is likely that graphene-based nanocarriers will find widespread application in biomedicine in the future.",

However, the merging of graphene and biotechnology is in its infancy, with many challenges remaining. Control of the size and number of single layers of graphene separated from bulk graphite might be the foremost challenge for the application of graphene as the building block of functionalized biosystems. Pristine graphene possesses a super quenching ability for FRET applications, but it is highly hydrophobic. Likewise, GO has been widely used in the fields of FRET biosensor studies because of its good solubility, but it is lack of super fast electron transfer. Preparation of soluble, well-defined graphene or graphene derivates with high quenching efficiency is another challenge. Cytotoxicity, the cellular uptake mechanism, and the intracellular metabolic pathway of graphene and its derivates remain almost unknown, which are highly important research areas and are crucial if we are going to use graphene in living cell studies and for in vivo applications. Furthermore, although non-covalent adsorption between ssDNA and graphene is considered as a prior principle, we think the novel graphene-based FRET biosensors based on covalent binding or other binding forms will be one probable direction for future research. Many promising results about graphene chemistry have been produced in the past several years, which might open a new stage for the modification and functionalization of graphene with biomolecules. In our opinion, more novel designs for graphene-based FRET are highly desired for future studies. Such exploration will benefit the FRET biosensor field, and provide better ideas for the applications of graphene in biotechnology in vitro and in vivo, such as graphenebased cellular probing, diagnostics, drug delivery, and therapy.",
