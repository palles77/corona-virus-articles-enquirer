In comparing the response of IFN\u03b3treated primary neurons to control MEF, we observed that neurons demonstrated lower basal expression of both STAT1 and STAT3, the primary signal transducers responsible for IFN\u03b3 signaling. Following IFN\u03b3 treatment of these cell populations, we noted muted and delayed STAT1 phosphorylation, no detectable STAT3 phosphorylation, and a 3-10-fold lower level of representative IFN\u03b3-responsive gene transcripts. Moreover, in response to a brief pulse of IFN\u03b3, a steady increase in STAT1 phosphorylation and IFN\u03b3 gene expression over 48 h was observed in neurons, as compared to rapid attenuation in MEF. These distinct response kinetics in IFN\u03b3-stimulated neurons may reflect modifications in the IFN\u03b3 negative feedback loop, which may provide a mechanism for the cellspecific heterogeneity of responses to IFN\u03b3.",

IFN\u03b3 plays a crucial role in noncytolytic clearance of viruses in the \"immune-privileged\" environment of the central nervous system (CNS), including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Komatsu et al., 1996) , measles virus (Patterson et al., 2002) , Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (Rodriguez et al., 2003) , Sindbis virus (Burdeinick-Kerr and Griffin, 2005) , and West Nile virus (Shrestha et al., 2006) . IFN\u03b3 is also crucial for the resolution of some intracellular bacterial infections within the brain (Jin et al., 2004) . However, IFN\u03b3 has also been implicated in the immunopathogenesis of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis (reviewed in Sanders and De Keyser, 2007) , ischemia (Takagi et al., 2002) , and other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's Disease (Bate et al., 2006) .

Briefly, IFN\u03b3 binding and subsequent assembly of its receptor complex (consisting of a heterotetramer of IFN\u03b3R1 and R2 subunits), stimulates the activation of receptor-associated JAK1 and JAK2 protein tyrosine kinases, resulting in the tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of the IFN\u03b3R1 subunits. Upon docking to the phosphorylated R1 subunit, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 701 (pY701), resulting in its homodimerization. The STAT1(pY701) homodimer then translocates to the nucleus and binds to Gamma Activated Sequence (GAS) elements within the promoters of IFN\u03b3-responsive genes, thus influencing their expression. In addition to STAT1, IFN\u03b3 stimulation also results (to a lesser degree) in phosphorylation of STAT3. Upon activation, STAT3 can homodimerize or form a heterodimer with phosphorylated STAT1, translocate to the nucleus and also bind to GAS elements.",

            "text": "In spite of the relatively straightforward nature of these well-characterized signal transduction pathways, the cellular response to IFN\u03b3 is complex and cell-specific. The genes that are induced in IFN\u03b3-stimulated cells can result in a wide range of consequences, including cellular activation, proliferation, or the induction of apoptosis (reviewed in Stark et al., 1998) . While it is clear that IFN\u03b3 can elicit varied outcomes, the mechanisms governing the way a given cell responds to IFN\u03b3 remain largely unclear. Previous studies have examined differences in GAS element binding and transcription factor specificity (e.g. Horvath et al., 1995; reviewed in Ramana et al., 2000; Schroder et al., 2004) to elucidate mechanisms of cell-specific responses to IFN\u03b3. In addition, many of the studies characterizing the IFN\u03b3 response have focused on a single cell type (such as hepatocytes, fibroblasts, or transformed cell lines). This has resulted in the impression that the cytoplasmic signaling pathways triggered in response to IFN\u03b3 are somewhat generic, and potential cellular or developmental differences in upstream IFN\u03b3 signaling events have therefore been largely overlooked. Recently however, Qing and Stark demonstrated that in the absence of STAT1, IFN\u03b3 signals through STAT3 and induces overlapping but distinct gene products (Qing and Stark, 2004) . These investigators proposed that differential use of signaling pathways could therefore explain some of the differences observed in IFN\u03b3 responses by diverse cell types. In addition, Costa-Pereira et al. demonstrated that cell lines expressing two IFN\u03b3 receptors differing in a single amino acid showed altered kinetics of STAT phosphorylation, which resulted in diverse profiles of downstream gene transcription (Costa-Pereira et al., 2005) .",

Because immunity in the CNS is highly regulated, cell-specific differences in IFN\u03b3 signaling pathways may be particularly important in dictating the outcome of the host cell response in various pathogenic settings. We have therefore directly and quantitatively compared the responses of primary hippocampal neurons and matched primary fibroblasts to IFN\u03b3. We have investigated expression and phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3, as well as the duration of the cellular response to IFN\u03b3. We found that the neuronal response was remarkably distinct from that of control fibroblasts, providing support for the notion that differences at the level of signal transduction exist between cell types of distinct tissue origin. Furthermore, we demonstrated alterations in the expression of several IFN\u03b3responsive genes in treated neurons and fibroblasts, underscoring the importance of both the timing and magnitude of STAT signaling pathways in orchestrating the cell-specific response to exogenous IFN\u03b3.",

Briefly, liver tissue was excised and discarded, and the remaining tissue was then dissociated in 0.4% trypsin, followed by trituration with a 10 ml pipette. The suspension was incubated for 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C; 5 ml fresh trypsin was then added and the suspension was incubated for an additional 10 minutes at 37\u00b0C.

As expected, no phospho-STAT1 was detected in either cell population in the absence of IFN\u03b3 exposure. When cells were treated with IFN\u03b3, rapid and robust STAT1 activation was observed in MEF, whereas only a weak (approximately 20-fold less) signal was detected in treated neurons, even after 6 h of exposure. Activated STAT1 was notable only after approximately 24 h post-exposure in neurons, coincident with an increase in available total STAT1 protein. Presumably, the low levels of activated STAT1 in neurons at early times post-IFN\u03b3 exposure were sufficient to induce transcription of STAT1, leading to the increased presence of available STAT1 protein by 24 h. An identical pattern of STAT1 expression was observed when samples from equal numbers of neurons and MEF were analyzed (Figure 1a , ii). Differential expression of STAT1, coupled with muted STAT1 activation in neurons after IFN\u03b3 exposure, was observed in at least five different primary culture preparations, and the altered response kinetics between the two cell types was unaffected when 10-fold higher and lower doses of IFN\u03b3 were tested (10-1000 U/ ml; data not shown). From these data, we conclude that expression of STAT1 in primary neurons obtained from the embryonic mouse hippocampus is lower than in MEFs on a total cell protein basis, leading to muted and delayed STAT1 activation.",

Moreover, while levels of phospho-STAT1 in MEF followed a cyclic pattern (with a periodicity of approximately 12 h), phospho-STAT1 levels in neurons did not: in neurons, phospho-STAT1 levels began to slowly increase at approximately 2 h of sustained IFN\u03b3 treatment, continued to increase until around 16 h, and then remained approximately constant thereafter.

As constitutive STAT1 expression was markedly reduced in neurons (Figure 1a) , we tested the hypothesis that STAT3 was playing a predominant role in IFN\u03b3 signal transduction in these cells. However, in IFN\u03b3-treated neurons, phospho-STAT3 was not detected at any time post-IFN\u03b3 addition, even though total STAT3 protein was upregulated after extended (e.g. 24 h) IFN\u03b3 treatment (Figure 2a) . In contrast, MEF demonstrated an early induction of STAT3 phosphorylation, and expressed unphosphorylated STAT3 constitutively (Figure 2a) . This modest activation of STAT3 in wild-type MEF (expressing STAT1) was consistent with previous work (Qing and Stark, 2004) . Treatment of neurons and MEF with another STAT3activating cytokine, IL-6, gave identical results (Figure 2b) , supporting the hypothesis that bioavailability, rather than proximal signals following receptor binding, are the basis for cellspecific differences in STAT activation.",

The induction of CXCL10 mRNA expression in MEF was approximately three-fold higher than in neurons during the first 24 h of IFN\u03b3 exposure, increasing to approximately 5fold higher levels during the next 18 h ( Figure 4a ); similar results were observed for IRF-1 expression ( Figure 4b ).

However, MEF again demonstrated two-to three-fold higher levels of IFN\u03b3-induced SOCS-1 transcription as compared to neurons throughout the time course (Figure 4c ).

To establish whether the observed dampening and delay in neuronal STAT1 signaling following IFN\u03b3 treatment was due to a strong negative feedback response, we characterized the duration of STAT1 phosphorylation in neurons and MEF following a 30-min \"pulse\" of IFN\u03b3. Cells were exposed to IFN\u03b3 for 30 min, and then were extensively washed to eliminate any remaining IFN\u03b3. To confirm that the IFN\u03b3 was washed out, washes were tested on untreated MEF, which demonstrated no significant STAT1 phosphorylation after 30 min of exposure (data not shown). Whole cell lysates were collected at the indicated timepoints post-pulse (Figure 5a ). In MEF, the phosphorylation of STAT1 was rapidly suppressed, and continued to decline throughout the timecouse. In contrast, a gradual increase of STAT1 phosphorylation in neurons up to 48 h was observed (Figure 5b ). This sustained response to a 30-min IFN\u03b3 pulse surpassed that of MEF in intensity between approximately 12-18 h (Figure 5b ). Only after 72 h post-IFN\u03b3 pulse did we observe a decrease in neuronal STAT1 phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus, while the kinetics of STAT1 phosphorylation in IFN\u03b3-treated neurons were muted and delayed (Figure 1 ), STAT1 phosphorylation was sustained for a markedly longer duration following a 30-min IFN\u03b3 pulse.",

For example, in many mouse models of neurotropic viral infection, including those caused by measles virus, Sindbis virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, and West Nile virus, IFN\u03b3 is critical for viral clearance and recovery. In contrast, in cerebral malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum, IFN\u03b3 and other Th1 cytokines have been implicated in the promotion of immunopathology and exacerbation of disease (reviewed in Hunt and Grau, 2003) . Moreover, in non-pathogen associated CNS diseases such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of multiple sclerosis, IFN\u03b3 is considered the key causative factor in the hallmark demyelination (reviewed in Popko et al., 1997) . Surely some of the reasons for this differential impact of IFN\u03b3 within the CNS include the location, duration and amount of IFN\u03b3 produced: in viral infections, for example, production of IFN\u03b3 by infiltrating NK and T cells may be brief and focused on a relatively low number of infected cells, whereas in chronic neuroinflammatory diseases such as EAE, unremitting IFN\u03b3 production directed at a more ubiquitous antigen (such as an autoantigen) may elicit neurotoxicity. Indeed, IFN\u03b3 is known to be directly cytotoxic: gene expression changes consequent to IFN\u03b3 exposure can lead to apoptosis (reviewed in Schroder et al., 2004) . Moreover, mice that genetically cannot downregulate IFN\u03b3 responses die within two to three weeks of birth (Alexander et al., 1999) .",

Since numerous independent negative feedback pathways act to inhibit the IFN\u03b3 response, we took a functional approach by comparing the duration of STAT1 phosphorylation and changes in gene expression in neurons following a brief (30 min) pulse of IFN\u03b3. The observations that i) STAT1 phosphorylation in pulsed neurons gradually increased over 48 h, while being rapidly attenuated in MEF; and ii) the mRNAs encoding CXCL10, IRF-1, and SOCS-1 also accumulated during this time period, further substantiated that fundamental differences in signaling and negative feedback have a direct effect on gene expression.",

            "text": "The extended phosphorylation of STAT1 seen in primary neurons following an IFN\u03b3 pulse may be the result of differences in any one of several mechanisms. As mentioned, the activity of negative feedback proteins, including the SOCS family, may be impaired in IFN\u03b3-stimulated neurons, thus allowing the receptor-associated JAKs (JAK1 and JAK2) to remain active for an extended period post-stimulation. Alternatively, decreased expression of neuronal protein tyrosine phosphatases may allow the R1 subunits of the receptor complex to remain phosphorylated, thus prolonging the availability of docking sites for STAT1 activation. Finally, the rate of STAT1 inactivation via dephosphorylation (reviewed in Darnell, 1997) in IFN\u03b3treated neurons may be delayed, allowing the nuclear accumulation of phosphorylated STAT1 over time. Regardless of the mechanism, it is important to note that similar responses have been observed in rat pancreatic islet cells pulsed with IFN\u03b3 (Heitmeier et al., 1999) . In these treated cells, STAT1 was still phosphorylated and localized to the nucleus 7 days post-pulse, though the reasons for this sustained response were not addressed. Nevertheless, the ability of cells to modulate the duration of response to exogenous cytokines may be an important parameter in understanding cell-specific patterns in host immunity.",

The cellular differences observed in IFN\u03b3R1 RNA do not necessarily imply differences in protein expression. In a study of cultured dorsal root ganglia neurons, Wekerle and colleagues detected robust expression of both IFN\u03b3 subunits (Neumann et al., 1997) ; thus, either subunit expression is neuron-subtype dependent, or our RNA studies do not parallel protein levels. However, even if the level of the IFN\u03b3R1 subunit is lower in neurons, functional complexes can be made, since we show in Figure 1 that the low available levels of STAT1 in neurons can still be activated in IFN\u03b3 stimulated neurons. How lower expression of this one subunit may impact on the neuronal response to exogenous cytokines is a matter of current study.",

As many IFN\u03b3-responsive genes also possess promoter elements to which NF-kB can bind, the convergence of multiple signaling pathways, such as the STAT and NF-kB pathways, likely governs the individual cellular response to exogenous cytokines.

            "text": "In summary, we have shown that cell-specific variations in IFN\u03b3 signaling pathways, including bioavailability of key signaling effectors, strongly influence gene expression. These data further aid our understanding of why potent cytokines such as IFN\u03b3 may have apparently paradoxical effects under different circumstances. For example, perhaps less rapid and robust induction of IFN\u03b3-responsive genes, many of which can be cytotoxic, may be advantageous for CNS neurons, and may afford some degree of protection under circumstances of chronic inflammatory challenges. Obviously, these ex vivo studies require confirmation in vivo, but we speculate that altered signaling pathways may act as a buffer between exogenous cytokines and the neuronal response. These variations in signal transduction span from receptor expression to nuclear localization of transcription factors, ultimately impacting on the initiation, intensity, duration, and profile of downstream gene expression. While the data presented in this paper pertain to the role of STAT1 in type II interferon signaling, STAT1 also plays a central role in target cell response to type I interferons. We would therefore predict that the observations presented here are pertinent to the neuronal response to type I interferons as well. An appreciation of how cells respond to soluble immune mediators will be crucial for the development of immune-based therapies appropriately tailored to the antigenic stimulus. The kinetics of STAT1 phosphorylation in response to IFN\u03b3 (100U/ml) were examined in neurons and MEF. a) Quantitative timecourse immunoblot analysis of i) purified total protein (20 \u03bcg/lane) isolated from untreated and IFN\u03b3-treated neurons and MEF, and ii) samples from whole cell lysates of equal numbers (5.32\u00d710 5 cells per condition) of neurons and MEF, using antibodies specific for phospho-STAT1 (pY701), STAT1, and GAPDH. Blots were first analyzed for phospho-STAT1 (pY701) and GAPDH, and were then stripped and analyzed for STAT1. The presence of phospho-STAT1 in the apparent absence of total STAT1 in neurons is likely due to differences in antibody affinity. b) \"Per-molecule\" response of STAT1 activation in neurons and MEF as assessed by normalization of phospho-STAT1 signal to STAT1 and GAPDH signals. Data from two timecourse studies similar to that described in (a) above was analyzed using densitometry; mean normalized phospho-STAT1 signal is shown. c) Densitometric quantitation of 48 h IFN\u03b3 timecourse. Purified total protein (20 \u03bcg/ lane) isolated from untreated and IFN\u03b3-treated neurons and MEF was analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies specific for phospho-STAT1 and GAPDH. The phospho-STAT1 signal was normalized to the GAPDH signal to control for loading, and is presented as percent maximum phospho-STAT1 signal. d) Densitometric quantitation of STAT1 phosphorylation in response to continual IFN\u03b3 stimulation in neurons 1, 5, and 8 d post-plating, and in MEF. IFN\u03b3 was added to cultures, whole cell lysates were collected at indicated timepoints post-IFN\u03b3 addition, and the lysates were analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies specific for phospho-STAT1 and GAPDH. The phospho-STAT1 signal is presented as described in (a).",

Conditioned culture medium was replaced after washing, and cells were lysed at the indicated timepoints post-treatment. b) Equal volumes of whole cell lysates were examined by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-STAT1 and anti-GAPDH antibodies.
