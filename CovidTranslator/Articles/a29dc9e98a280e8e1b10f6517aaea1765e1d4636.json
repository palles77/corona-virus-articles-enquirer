How external signaling pathways connect to core self-renewal transcriptional circuits is largely unknown. To probe this, we chose BMP signaling, which is previously recognized as a master control for both self-renewal and lineage commitment of murine ES cells. Here, we mapped target gene promoter occupancy of SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 on a genome-wide scale and found that they associate with a large group of developmental regulators that are enriched for H3K27 trimethylation and H3K4 trimethylation bivalent marks and are repressed in the self-renewing state, whereas they are rapidly induced upon differentiation. Smad knockdown experiments further indicate that SMAD-mediated BMP signaling is largely required for differentiation-related processes rather than directly influencing self-renewal. Among the SMAD-associated genes, we further identified Dpysl2 (previously known as Crmp2) and the H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b (previously known as Jmjd3) as BMP4-modulated early neural differentiation regulators. Combined with computational analysis, our results suggest that SMAD-mediated BMP signaling balances self-renewal versus differentiation by modulating a set of developmental regulators.",

ES cells are under precise control to keep their identity or to enter determined differentiation programs upon exposure to specific differentiation cues. However, the mechanism of such coordinated control by intrinsic regulators and extrinsic stimuli is largely unknown. For intrinsic regulators, recent studies indicated that ES cells possess a core self-renewal regulatory network consisting of several critical transcription factors such as NANOG, POU5F1 (previously known as OCT4), and SOX2 (Boyer et al. 2005; Loh et al. 2006; Cole et al. 2008; Kim et al. 2008) . These studies also suggested that a large set of developmental regulators whose expression is strongly associated with the cell fate switch between self-renewal and differentiation are systematically coordinated by these master transcription factors through direct promoter occupancy. This self-renewal network is further strengthened by the incorporation of the polycomb repressive complex, which co-occupies a large number of de-velopmental regulators with those core transcription factors, thus contributing to the maintenance of ES cell pluripotency by epigenetic modification of chromatin structure (Boyer et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2006a) . Extrinsic stimuli, provided by the stem cell niche, culture conditions or cell-autonomous autocrine secretion, can promote self-renewal or differentiation and usually act through various signaling transduction pathways. Among them, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-STAT3, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-SMAD, and Wnt-beta-catenin pathways have been suggested as master signaling pathways to regulate both mouse ES cell selfrenewal and differentiation (Niwa et al. 1998; Ying et al. 2003a; Sato et al. 2004) .",

As a member of the TGF-beta superfamily, BMP transduces its signal via the intracellular downstream mediators-R-SMAD proteins (SMAD1, SMAD5, SMAD8). The activated R-SMADs form a complex with Co-SMAD SMAD4 and regulate target gene expression through cooperation with other DNA-binding factors and transcription factors in the nucleus (Datto and Wang 2000; Massague and Chen 2000; ten Dijke and Hill 2004; Feng and Derynck 2005; Massague et al. 2005) . Previous studies indicated that murine ES cells (mESCs) possess an autocrine BMP signaling which can promote self-renewal in collaboration with LIF-STAT3 by induction of Id proteins to suppress neural lineages differentiation (Ying et al. 2003a) , or by inhibiting ERK and MAPK14 (previously known as p38) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways (Qi et al. 2004) . BMP signaling is also widely involved in a broad spectrum of differentiation programs such as neural, hematopoietic, cardiomyogenic, and hepatic lineage formation, consistent with the notion that BMPs act as a critical signal during early embryo development and adult tissue homeostasis (Kishigami and Mishina 2005) . However, whether the role of BMP signaling in maintenance of mESCs is via promoting self-renewal or via preventing differentiation is still obscure.",

We found that SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 occupy a group of developmental regulators which are repressed in self-renewing ES cells while rapidly induced upon differentiation. Functional analyses indicated that SMAD1/5-and SMAD4-mediated signaling is required largely to orchestrate differentiation rather than to directly promote self-renewal. Finally, we provided evidence that both Dpysl2 and Kdm6b are BMP/SMAD targets and function as early neural differentiation regulators.",

Although SMAD8 is also a BMP-regulated R-SMAD, it is poorly recognized by anti-SMAD1/5 antibody (Supplemental Fig. S1) , and its mRNA level is low in R1 cells (data not shown). Genomic DNA fragments enriched by ChIP were amplified and subjected to hybridization to Agilent mouse promoter array, which contains 60-mer oligonucleotides probes ;200 base pairs (bp) apart covering the region from -5.5 kilobases (kb) to +2.5 kb relative to the transcriptional start sites (TSS) for ;17,000 annotated mouse genes ( Fig. 1A ; Supplemental Methods). Potential binding sites were defined as continuous peaks of signal intensity ( Fig. 1B ; Supplemental Tables S1, S2). We then mapped these binding sites to the mouse genome and finally identified 562 SMAD1/5-associated genes and 2518 SMAD4-associated genes, respectively (Supplemental Tables  S3, S4) . We then validated the SMAD-DNA binding from randomly selected target genes using a modified ChIP-PCR method as described previously (Lee et al. 2006b ) and confirmed the SMAD association in 72 out of the 91 examined genomic regions ( Fig. 1C ; Supplemental Fig. S2 ), suggesting an estimated false positive rate of ;20%, which falls into a normal level compared with many other such types of works (Martone et al. 2003; Odom et al. 2004; Hartman et al. 2005; Zheng et al. 2007; Mathur et al. 2008) . We also subjected ChIP DNA of SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 to Illumina sequencing and found that the majority (62.5%) of SMAD1/5 ChIPchip target sites and 40.5% of the SMAD4 ChIP-chip target sites can be validated by either SMAD1/5 or SMAD4 ChIP-seq (Supplemental Tables S3, S4) .",

To examine whether these de novo predicted motifs have real SMAD-binding activity, we selected the first four motifs and performed oligonucleotide pull-down analysis with biotinylated DNA oligonucleotides consisting of four repeats of the predicted 8-mer motifs. All of them could apparently pull down their corresponding SMAD proteins although the fourth motif of SMAD4 (M4) showed a relatively weak SMAD-binding activity (Supplemental Fig. S4B ).

To confirm the microarray data, some of the genes with SMAD binding in the two groups were examined for their responses to BMP4 and noggin treatment by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). As shown in Figure 3A , these genes were indeed differentially regulated by BMP4 and noggin treatment.

The expression profiles for most of the tested genes in these Smad knockdown cells were in agreement with those upon BMP4/noggin treatment (Fig. 3B ). For example, the Group I genes Wwc2 and Kank2 that were up-regulated by BMP4 exhibited reduced expression in Smad1 knockdown cells, whereas the Group II genes Accn4, Scarf2, Nkx6-2, and Alx3 that were up-regulated by noggin showed enhanced expression in Total RNA was extracted and gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR.

ES cells and day 8 EB were treated with BMP4 for 4 h and total RNA was extracted for qRT-PCR analysis. More SMAD-binding targets were randomly selected from both SMAD1/5 and SMAD4-binding targets (Supplemental Tables S3, S4) such as Kdm6b, Ntrk3, Sesn2, and Tal1.

Taken together, these results indicate that the DNA binding of SMAD proteins does mediate BMP-induced transcriptional control both in the self-renewal state or in certain differentiation context and that endogenous BMP signaling mainly plays a repressive role in self-renewing ES cells.",

The SMAD-binding frequency in a sliding window from the up-to down-regulated genes revealed that both SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 targets were enriched among the up-regulated genes upon differentiation (see pink area in Fig. 4B ). SMAD1/5 targets also showed modest enrichment in the downregulated group (green area), whereas there was no enrichment of SMAD4 targets in the down-regulated group. The observation that a significant amount of SMAD1/5-and SMAD4-associated genes are silenced in self-renewing ES cells while tending to be rapidly induced upon differentiation resembles the pattern of the bivalently modified genes in ES cells that have both H3K4 trimethylation and H3K27 trimethylation and largely encode developmental regulators (Bernstein et al. 2006) .",

How SMAD-mediated BMP signaling orchestrates self-renewal and early differentiation has not been systematically analyzed. To test whether SMAD-mediated BMP signaling is necessary for ES cell self-renewal, we examined the mRNA expression of several widely used self-renewal markers-Nanog, Pou5f1, and Zfp42 (previously known as Rex1)-in Smad1 and Smad4 knockdown ES cells. Consistent with the lack of morphological changes of the ES cells, we found no significant difference of those self-renewal markers at the mRNA level in Smad1 or Smad4 knockdown ES cells compared to control cells (Fig. 5A) . The protein level of POU5F1 also remained unchanged in the Smad knockdown ES cells (Fig. 5B ). Pluripotent ES cells undergo rapid proliferation, but Smad knockdown did not influence the proliferation rate of ES cells (Supplemental Fig. S9 ), implying that SMAD1 and SMAD4 may not be crucial for self-renewal. This result is in accordance with the observation that Smad4 knockout ES cells show no defect of self-renewal and proliferation (Sirard et al. 1998) . When examining endogenous BMP signaling activity during ES cell to EB differentiation by monitoring SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, the phospho-SMAD1/5 level was lower in ES cells as compared with EB (Fig. 5C) , suggesting that BMP signaling activity is low and then elevated during differentiation.",

As shown in Figure  5D , the expression of trophoblast lineage markers Eomes in both Smad1 and Smad4 knockdown cells and Cdx2 in Smad4 knockdown cells was down-regulated. Sox1, an ectodermal marker, was elevated in both Smad1 and Smad4 knockdown cells, consistent with BMP inhibition of early neural fate (Liu and Niswander 2005) . The expression pattern of another ectodermal marker Fgf5 was also altered. Both Smad1 and Smad4 knockdown led to significantly reduced expression of endodermal marker-alpha fetoprotein (Afp). Two mesodermal markers, brachyury (T) and goosecoid (Gsc), were modestly decreased in Smad4 knockdown cells in certain time points whereas no significant change was observed in Smad1 knockdown cells. Considering that SMAD1 and SMAD5 may have overlapping functions in ES cells, the observed effects of Smad1 knockdown here should be an underestimation of BMPregulated R-SMAD functions. Nonetheless, these changes together reflect the requirement of BMP signaling for early embryogenesis (Winnier et al. 1995) . Therefore, SMAD1-and SMAD4-mediated signaling is mainly required for proper differentiation programming rather than for direct self-renewal maintenance, consistent with the above observation that a significant portion of SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 target genes are development-or differentiation-related. . SMAD1 and SMAD4 are largely involved in differentiation regulation rather than direct selfrenewal maintenance. (A) Knockdown of Smad1 or Smad4 has no effect on the expression of selfrenewal markers. Total RNA extracted from R1 cells expressing Smad shRNA or control shRNA constructs were subjected to RT-PCR. Gapdh served as a loading control. (B) No difference of the POU5F1 protein levels in R1 cells expressing Smad shRNA or control shRNA. Protein expression was examined by immunoblotting. Tubulin served as a loading control.

GAPDH served as a loading control. (D) Smad knockdown alters the expression profile of germ layer markers. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed to examine marker expression in Smad shRNA and control shRNA cells during the course of EB differentiation. The significance of expression was analyzed by Student's t-test, and data are presented as mean 6 SEM (n = 3; **P < 0.01; *P < 0.05).

Using two independent specific Dpysl2 shRNA constructs (D1 and D2) (Supplemental Fig. S11 ), we found that Dpysl2 knockdown dramatically reduced the expression of Sox1 especially at day 5 of neural differentiation (Fig. 6B) , suggesting a requirement of DPYSL2 for proper neural precursor commitment. This was further confirmed by examining nestin expression, which was also downregulated in Dpysl2 knockdown cells ( Fig.  6C; Supplemental Fig. S12 ). To further demonstrate that Dpysl2 is a direct target of SMAD-mediated BMP signaling, we cloned the Dpysl2 promoter region (\u00c0968 to +619) into pGL3-Basic luciferase plasmid to examine the SMAD effect on the Dpysl2 promoter transcriptional activity (Fig. 6D ). As expected, the construct (619-Luc) covering a predicted SMAD-binding element (SBE) exhibited SMAD1/4 concentration-dependent transcriptional repression in HEK293T cells whereas the construct (212-Luc) without the SBE had no response. This result was further confirmed by constitutively active BMP receptor ALK6 (BMPR1B) (Supplemental Fig.  S13 ). In addition, using oligonucleotides derived from the putative SMAD binding DNA sequences of the Dpysl2 promoter as probes, oligonucleotide pull-down assay also revealed that both SMAD1 and SMAD4 could directly bind to the Dpysl2 promoter (Supplemental Fig. S14 ). To confirm the function of Dpysl2 in neural differentiation, we transiently overexpressed DPYSL2 as a GFP fusion protein in R1 cells (Supplemental Fig. S15 ). As shown in Figure 6E , DPYSL2 overexpression elevated the expression of Sox1 and nestin at day 3 of neural differentiation. These data together strongly suggest that Dpysl2 is a bona fide BMP/SMAD target and plays a role in early neural differentiation.",

Like Dpysl2, the Kdm6b promoter was co-occupied by both SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 (Fig. 1C ) and its expression was significantly reduced by transient BMP4 treatment in day 8 EB (Fig. 3C) , implying its possible function in a certain differentiation process. We then tested this possibility in neural differentiation and found that Kdm6b expression increased at the early stages of neural differentiation and then declined gradually (Fig. 6F) . Interestingly, BMP4 inhibited Kdm6b expression just at the early stage (Fig. 6F) , and enhanced SMAD protein association with the Kdm6b promoter was also observed upon BMP4 treatment during this early stage (Supplemental Fig.  S16A ). Further, the correlation of decreased SMAD binding with Kdm6b up-regulation during neural differentiation also indicates a repressive role of BMP/SMAD signaling on Kdm6b in self-renewing ES cells (Fig. 6F; Supplemental Fig. S16B ). When Kdm6b was knocked down by two specific shRNA constructs (K1 and K2) (Supplemental Fig. S11 ), neural differentiation is significantly impaired as shown by the decreased expression of Sox1 and nestin (Fig.  6G,H) . This is consistent with the recently reported role of KDM6B in early neural differentiation (Burgold et al. 2008) . Therefore, our Dpysl2 expression is increased during neural differentiation, and BMP4 impairs this increase at the early stage (day 1, 3). R1 cells were cultured in neural differentiation medium in the presence (+) or absence (\u00c0) of 10 ng/mL BMP4 for 5 d or treated with BMP4 for 4 h before harvest (4 h). Dpysl2 expression was determined by qRT-PCR. (B) Dpysl2 knockdown reduces Sox1 expression. Sox1 expression was determined in the Dpysl2 shRNA D1-or D2-expressing cells that were subjected to neural differentiation. (C ) Dpysl2 knockdown reduces nestin expression. Nestin expression was determined by immunofluorescence in the shRNA D1-or D2-expressing cells at day 5 of neural differentiation. (D) SMAD represses the Dpysl2 promoter activity. (Left) Schematic map of the Dpysl2 promoter-driven luciferase reporters. TSS, transcriptional start sites; SBE, SMAD-binding element (for both SMAD1/5 and SMAD4) that is predicted from ChIP-chip analysis (Supplemental Tables S1, S2). Reporter plasmid (0.1 mg), Renilla plasmid (10 ng), SMAD1 and SMAD4 (0, 0.05 mg, or 0.1 mg, each) were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. At 36 h post-transfection, cells were harvested for luciferase assay. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and the data are presented as mean 6 SEM of three independent experiments after normalization to Renilla activity. (E ) DPYSL2 increases Sox1 and nestin expression during early neural differentiation. R1 ES cells were transfected with pEGFP-Dpysl2 or pEGFP-C3 empty vector respectively and then replated for neural differentiation. RNA was extracted at day 3 for qRT-PCR analysis. (F ) Kdm6b expression is reduced by BMP4 in the early stages of neural differentiation. (G) Kdm6b knockdown reduces Sox1 expression. Sox1 expression was determined in the shRNA K1-or K2-expressing cells that were subjected to neural differentiation similarly as in B. (H) Kdm6b knockdown decreases nestin expression. Nestin expression was determined by immunofluorescence in shRNA K1-or K2-expressing cells at day 5 of neural differentiation. ",

We found that SMAD4 occupies a larger number of genes than SMAD1/5 does, and a significant portion of SMAD1/5-bound genes is not co-occupied by SMAD4. The following reasons may account for the low co-occupancy. First, SMAD4, in addition to transducing BMP signaling, also mediates TGF-beta/Activin/Nodal signaling. Indeed, recent studies also suggested that Activin/Nodal signaling is required for mouse ES cells propagation (Ogawa et al. 2007 ). Second, SMAD1/5 may function in a SMAD4-independent manner (He et al. 2006; Zhao et al. 2008; Retting et al. 2009 ).",

It was previously suggested that Id genes (Id1 and Id3) are primary targets of BMP/SMAD signaling in inhibiting neural differentiation (Ying et al. 2003a) , and our cDNA array also identified Id1, Id2, Id3 as significantly up-regulated genes by BMP4 in self-renewing ES cells (Supplemental Table S6 ). However, these genes were not in our SMAD-bound genes list although ChIP-site specific PCR revealed SMAD1/5-immunoprecipetated Id1 promoter regions from ES cells (data not shown).

This result supports the notion that SMAD-mediated BMP signaling, in collaboration with LIF, can promote self-renewal by inhibiting neural differentiation (Ying et al. 2003a) . By analyzing gene expression profile during EB differentiation, we found SMADbound genes are predominantly repressed in ES cells and rapidly up-regulated upon differentiation, which is further confirmed by computational analysis of histone H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation. Both SMAD1/5 and SMAD4 targets are indeed enriched in bivalently modified genes. H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation are generally indicative of genes activation and repression, respec-tively (Mikkelsen et al. 2007) , while genes with bivalent modification are found to largely encode important developmental regulators in ES cells and are silent but ''poised'' for rapid activation (Bernstein et al. 2006) . However, it remains unclear whether such histone modifications are directly regulated by SMAD binding. Examination of the responsiveness of SMAD-bound genes to BMP4 or noggin also indicated that most of those genes are repressed by BMP in self-renewing ES cells, further confirming that BMP-SMAD signaling controls the expression of developmental regulators.",

However, little is known about direct targets of BMP to interpret BMP signaling in specific mammalian developmental process. Our data have provided some potential target genes. For instance, we found that Dpysl2, a gene highly expressed in the neural system, had an important function in early neural differentiation. Our results have also revealed that another BMP/SMAD target, the histone H3K27 demethylase Kdm6b, is required for early neural differentiation, implying that BMP signaling may regulate certain differentiation processes through transcriptional control of some key epigenetic regulators.",

Knockdown of Smad1 or Smad4 expression in ES cells did not impair their self-renewal ability but led to alterations in the expression pattern of germ layer markers during EB differentiation. Consistent with this, studies on in vitro differentiation of ES cells showed that SMAD-mediated BMP signals at least take part in neural, cardiomyogenic, hematopoietic, and hepatic lineages commitment (Loebel et al. 2003) . Although BMP has been found to promote ES cell self-renewal in the presence of LIF, it is not needed for self-renewal under NANOG overexpression (Ying et al. 2003a ). Furthermore, Smad4 \u00c0/\u00c0 ES cells show no defect in selfrenewal ability (Sirard et al. 1998) , and the embryos deficient of several BMP signaling components can all survive past the blastocyst stage when ES cells are derived and exhibited progressively embryonic lethality between embyonic day 6.5 and 11.5 (for reviews, see Datto and Wang 2000; Chang et al. 2002) , indicating a nonessential role of BMP signaling for ES cell self-renewal but rather necessary for proper lineage commitment. The fact that BMP combined with LIF can support mouse ES cell self-renewal is basically through inhibition of neural differentiation but not as a direct self-renewal enhancer (Ying et al. 2003a ; data not shown). As we focus our studies on SMAD-mediated BMP signaling, we cannot rule out the possibility that BMP may somewhat support self-renewal via other SMAD-independent pathways such as MAP kinases.",

This discrepancy could be due to the different binding profiles of SMAD1/5: Chen et al. (2008) found that a large portion of the SMAD1-binding regions were in the intergenic region without the canonical SMAD1-binding motif, whereas we focused our analysis on SMAD binding in the promoter regions and found that many of the SMAD1/5-binding sites were enriched with GC elements as identified in the canonical SMAD1binding motifs (Massague et al. 2005) .",
