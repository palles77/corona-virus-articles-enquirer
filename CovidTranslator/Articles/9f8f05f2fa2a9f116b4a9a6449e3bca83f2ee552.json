Some coronaviruses possess an additional structural protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE), closely related to the hemagglutinin-esterase fusion protein of influenza C virus. 10 Among RNA viruses, coronaviruses possess the largest genome, 27.6 to 31 kb in size. The 5=-most two thirds of the genome comprise the replicase gene, which consists of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF 1a and 1b. Located downstream of ORF1b are up to 11 ORFs that code for the 4 common structural proteins and a variable set of accessory proteins. Number, nucleotide sequence, and order of these additional genes can vary remarkably among different coronaviruses. The function of the accessory proteins is in most cases unknown. Albeit not essential for virus replication, they play an important role in virus-host interactions because they are generally maintained during natural infection, and their loss-either through spontaneous mutation or reversed genetics-results in reduced virulence. 10 Until a few years ago, three major coronavirus groups were distinguished based on phylogenetic and antigenic analyses. CCoV was included in phylogroup 1, together with feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) type I and type II, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine, porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), and human coronaviruses 229E (HCoV-229E) and NL63 (HCoV-NL63). 10 Subsequently, a ferret coronavirus 11 and viruses identified in bats 12 were proposed as tentative members of this group. Recently, the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses accepted the proposal of the Coronavirus Study Group to revise the family Coronaviridae to include the corona-and toroviruses as subfamilies (Corona-and Torovirinae) and to convert the coronavirus phylogroups 1, 2, and 3 into genera (Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammacoronavirus, respectively). 1 The new taxonomy is based upon rooted phylogeny and quantitative pairwise sequence comparison and includes a clear definition of coronavirus species demarcation in accordance with that used in other virus families. Given their close genetic relatedness (\u03fe96% amino acid identity in the key replicase 1ab domains), TGEV, CCoV, and FCoV are now considered not as separate viruses but rather as host range variants of the same species, Alphacoronavirus-1.",

            "text": "The first report on CCoV infection appeared in 1971, when Binn and colleagues isolated a coronavirus (strain 1-71) from dogs with acute enteritis in a canine military unit in Germany. 18 The disease could be reproduced in young dogs by experimental infection with the purified virus, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. 19 Since then, several CCoV outbreaks have been reported worldwide, showing that CCoV is an important enteropathogen of dogs. Serologic and virologic investigations demonstrated that CCoV is widespread in the dog population, and the virus is highly prevalent in kennels and animal shelters. 5 Enteric CCoV infection is characterized by high morbidity and low mortality. The virus is shed at high titers in the feces and transmitted via the fecal-oral route. CCoV infection is generally restricted to the alimentary tract, leading to the onset of clinical signs typical of gastroenteritis including loss of appetite, vomiting, fluid diarrhea, dehydration, and, only very rarely, death. 5 Although, in general, CCoV does not cause systemic disease, the virus has been isolated from several tissues (tonsils, lungs, and liver) of experimentally infected pups. 20 Fatal disease commonly occurs as a consequence of mixed infections of CCoV with canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), 21, 22 with canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV-1) 23 or with canine distemper virus (CDV). 24 Currently, two genotypes of CCoV are known, which have been designated CCoV types I (CCoV-I) and II (CCoV-II). [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] These genotypes differ mainly in their spike proteins that share only 54% identity. 25 Moreover, CCoV-I strains possess a unique ORF, 624 nt in length, that is completely absent in FCoV-I strains and of which only remnants remain in the genomes of CCoV-II and TGEV. 33 In addition, CCoVs with a recombinant origin between CCoV-II and TGEV have been identified in the feces of dogs with diarrhea and have been found to be widespread in dog populations. Accordingly, CCoV-II has been further classified into two subtypes, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb, including \"classic\" CCoVs and TGEV-like strains, respectively. 3 Subtype CCoV-IIb has been reported in several European countries, 4,34 as well as in Japan. 31",

[35] [36] [37] [38] On May 2005, a severe outbreak of fatal, systemic disease affected seven dogs housed in a pet shop in Apulia region, Italy. Clinical signs were first observed in three miniature pinschers and a cocker spaniel, 45 and 53 days of age, respectively, and were highly suggestive of canine parvovirus infection, consisting of fever (39.5\u00b0-40\u00b0C), lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, hemorrhagic diarrhea, and neurologic signs (ataxia, seizures) followed by death within 2 days after the onset of the symptoms. Veterinarians also reported a marked leukopenia, with total WBC counts below 50% of the baseline values. After a few days, the same signs were observed in two other 45-day-old miniature pinschers and in one 56-day-old Pekinese dog, which underwent a rapid fatal outcome. 6 Necropsy on the carcasses of these three pups revealed severe lesions in the alimentary tract, tonsils, lungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys. The most prominent lesion was hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Tonsils were enlarged and contained multifocal hemorrhages. Lobar subacute bronchopneumonia was evident both in the cranial and caudal lobes (Fig. 1) , and accompanied effusions in the thoracic cavity. Spleens were enlarged and exhibited subcapsular hemorrhages. Necrosis and lipidosis with hemorrhages was evident in the livers. Infarction and hemorrhages were detected in the cortex and medulla of kidneys ( Fig. 2 ; Ref. 6 ",

To date, two genotypes of CCoV have been described, CCoV-I and CCoV-II, with the latter including two different subtypes, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb. Usually, CCoV causes mild to severe diarrhea in pups, whereas fatal infections have been associated mainly with concurrent infections by other canine pathogens. However, a few years ago, an outbreak of fatal, systemic disease caused by a highly virulent CCoV-II strain (CB/05) was reported. To date, pantropic CCoV outbreaks have occurred in different parts of Europe, with clinical presentations and post mortem findings similar to those observed in the first outbreak. The pantropic CCoV-induced disease was also reproduced under experimental conditions, although the most prominent finding was a severe, long-lasting lymphopenia (mainly associated to a dramatic reduction of CD4 \u03e9 cells), rather than the death of the infected pups. Lacking any specific vaccine against this emerging pathogen of dogs, further studies should carefully evaluate (1) the worldwide distribution of the virus in dog populations and (2) the efficacy of existing vaccines, based on enteric CCoV, against pantropic viruses.",
