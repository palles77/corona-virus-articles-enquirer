The factor was a protein, produced in response to a viral infection, which subsequently inhibited infection with a second, related or unrelated, virus in a non-specific manner. This discovery created great excitement due to the implications of having an antiviral agent with a wide spectrum of antiviral activity for use in viral therapy. During the past 28 years, many aspects of the interferon (IFN) system have been elucidated, including the finding that IFN is not one protein, but a family of proteins with a multitude of biological and physiological functions. Thus, IFNs are not only powerful antiviral agents, but also have anticellular activity (against cancer cells) as well as a plethora of effects on the immune system.",

The BolFNet I gene family contains approximately 10-12 members, and sequepce analyses of homology within that family of genes. This family exhibits greater homology in both their coding and flanking regions to members of the class 1 human interferon-a (HulFN-at) gene family than they do to the BolFN-a e gene family. Similarly the BolFN-ot 2 subfamily, which contains 15-20 members, display greater homology to the members of the class 2 HulFN-ot genes than to the BolFN-cxf genes. Further similarities between human and bovine IFN-a~ and -a2 genes are demonstrated by the fact that the class 1 genes code for a mature protein of 165-166 amino acids whereas, the class 2 genes code for a protein of 172 amino acids in length in both species.",

However, whether all of the different IFN-a genes are actually expressed, i.e., translated, at any given encounter between a virus and a cell has not yet been elucidated. The indications are that depending on the virus, as well as on the cell type, BolFN-a genes may be differentially expressed (Czarniecki et al., unpublished data) . These results are in agreement with findings with human macrophage produced IFN [58] , where it ap-pears that the IFNs induced by different viruses differ in their antiviral activities, i.e., antiviral spectrum and potency [16, 116] . This could reflect the ability of different viruses to depress or regulate different IFN-genes during an infection. Further elucidation of these aspects will have to await cloning .and production of more IFN-ot subtypes of either class. Once gene probes are available, it will be possible to quantitate production of the individual IFN-mRNA following infection with different viruses [123] . Furthermore, the availability of purified individual IFN subtypes will also allow investigation into whether any specific subtype has a different mechanism of action.",

However, in some cases, especially where organ cultures were employed, the IFN may have been a mixture of IFN-a and -13 due to the presence of 'contaminating' macrophages (Mqb). Bovine Md~s are avid IFN-producers in response to in vitro virus-challenge [24, 26, 77, 100] as well as other acellular and cellular inducers [24] . The IFN produced by bovine Md~s is acid labile, but otherwise has the physico-chemical and antigenic characteristics of IFN-a. Recently, it has been found to belong to the class 2 IFN-a family, which, as previously mentioned, characteristically are acid labile (Shepard et al., unpublished data). When peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from seronegative (with respect to BHV-1) calves are exposed to BHV-1 infected fibroblasts they were found to produce IFN-a 2 (Shepard et al., unpublished data). This may largely be produced by the M~b population (monocytes) present in the PBL. In contrast, Fulton and Rosenquist [53] did not detect IFN-activity in PBL-cultures from non-immunized calves following infection in vitro with BHV-1. Whether this discrepancy is due to challenge dose, the way the virus was introduced into the in vitro system (i.e., as virus-infected cells or as cell-free virus suspension) or the sensitivity of the IFN-assay is presently not known. This latter finding is, however, surprising since infection of M~b with BHV-1 virus has been shown to rapidly induce high levels of IFN [26, 47] .",

The influence of some of these factors on bovine IFN production has been investigated by several groups; however, no consistent results have appeared [1, 42, 51, 73, 95] . The results of Fulton and Pearson [51] suggest that considerable differences exist between bovine continuous cell lines in their ability to produce IFNs in response to viruses. In addition, the passage level of the specific cell line may also influence the results [96] . This may reflect the continuous evolution of cells in culture and alteration of gene expression or possible infection with exogenous agents. A common contaminant of bovine cells and serum is the bovine pestivirus bovine viral diarrhea-virus (BVDV). Diderholm and Dinter [42] found that an infection with non-cytopathic BVDV significantly suppressed the IFN-response to a secondary viral infection. In contrast, Rossi and Kiesel [95] found that BVDV did not affect IFN production by polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly rI.poly rC). Thus, it may be that different inducers and contaminants may affect different genes or gene families differently. This could be especially important if some viral proteins or glycoproreins of BVDV affect host cell gene expression. If one isolate of BVDV is more active in this regard than another, this could easily explain the discrepancies reported. It is probable that exposure to a virus such as BVDV, which could induce various levels of IFN itself may alter subsequent IFN responses. Thus, care should be taken to insure that cultures are free of exogenous agents before they are used for the analysis of IFN responses.",

Priming has been demonstrated to occur for all 3 IFN-types [63, 95] . It is generally found that low, rather than high doses of impure IFN cause priming [108] . However, if pure interferon is used, priming can be observed at high doses [41a] . High doses of impure interferon can also induce a phenomenon designated 'blocking'. This latter phenomenon has been observed in bovine alveolar Mqb (AM) pretreated with pure rBolFN-a and subsequently challenged with BHV-1 [26] . These observations may have implications in the clinical use of IFNs, where the timing and doses of IFN application may alter the efficacy of its activity.",

            "text": "Numerous viruses have been reported to induce IFN in cattle. These include Newcastle disease virus, vaccinia virus, bovine parainfluenza-3 virus, bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenovirus, bovine enterovirus (strain LCR-4), BVDV, bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) (s. IBRV/IPV) and bovine rotaviruses [20, 34, 35, 36, 44, 67, 75, 88, 91, 92, 94, 101, 110, 113, 118, 126] . However, the role of IFN in limiting virus replication has not been established for most of these infections with the exception of BHV-1. Several groups have found a clear relationship between replication of BHV-1 in the nasal passage and IFN-titers in nasal secretions [20, 75, 113] . In contrast, IFN levels in serum are usually negligible following a respiratory tract infection with BHV-1, even though BHV-1 is believed to produce systemic infections [20,113, and u~apublished data] . Locally induced IFN, following an aerogenic BHV-1 infection, can confer at least partial protection against a secondary infection with either BHV-1 or an unrelated virus [34, 35, 36, 110, 113] . Whether locally produced IFN can have systemic effects and alter the outcome of the infection remains to be determined. Pretreatment of calves with cortisone enhances the IFN-generation upon BHV-1 challenge [33] , probably due to a corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression with subsequent unrestricted viral replication. Experimental (oral) infection of colostrum deprived calves with bovine rotavirus, results in the production of IFN which is detectable in the intestinal content and the gut mucosa as well as in the serum [67, 118] . The presence of IFN in the serum is rather surprising since the virus infection is believed to be a strictly local gut infection. This must indicate that adsorption of IFN through the mucosal surfaces is an efficient process. Following rotavirus infection, several waves of IFN production are usually detected, which correlates with virus multiplication in the gut. An inverse relationship between virus dose, IFN production and clinical disease seems to exist. With high doses of virus (5-20 x 109 PFU), IFN is produced very early (within the first 24 h p.i.) with no clinical symptoms of infection. In contrast, with a lower dose of virus (2-20 x 10 4 PFU), IFN production is delayed and the virus induces a transient diarrhea [118] . However, the role of IFN in limiting infection in the former instances must be interpreted with caution since rotavirus may, under such dose levels produce defective interfering particles which may be excellent IFN inducers, but unable to induce disease.",

This sugges-tion corroborates the antigenic characterization of gut-IFN [67] . It was suggested that the serum-IFN detected in calves challenged orally with rotavirus primarily originates from adsorption of intestinal (enterocyte-produced) IFN, because the weak viremia, if occurring, seems unlikely to be able to stimulate such a pronounced IFN response [67] . However, it is also possible that blood leukocytes, which are very avid IFN-producers may produce the IFNs. It should be possible to test these alternatives by a more thorough characterization of the intestinal and serum-IFN, respectively, as well as their specific roles in preventing virus replication either directly or indirectly, in enterocytes.",

Virus replicative intermediates such as dsRNA (viral replicative intermediates) first activate at least 2 and possibly as many as 4 synthetases, that synthesize a series of 2'5'-linked adenylate oligomers, also designated 2-5A. This activates a latent cellular endo-RNase (2-5A-dependent RNase, RNase L or F) which cleaves mRNA and rRNA. Constitutive levels of all of the enzymes in this cascade are present in variable amounts in a variety of cells and tissues, but in response to IFN the level of the 2-5A synthetase may increase 10-104 fold. Thus, this enzyme can be used as a biochemical marker for the sensitivity of a cell system or animal to IFN-treatment. This has recently been applied to the bovine system [55] . Only dsRNAs containing 50 or more base pairs are effective activators of 2-5A [14] . Since dsRNA of this size is not normally found in the cell cytoplasm, the strict size-requirements ensure that the IFN-induced enzymes are not accidentally activated in uninfected cells.",

As a result of these numerous effects of IFN on cells of the immune system, it is difficult to design in vivo experiments to answer one specific question regarding the mechanism(s) of IFN action, and to verify the importance of endogenous IFN in antiviral resistance. Gresser et al. [57] demonstrated that injection of anti-IFN-serum could reduce the resistance of mice to a variety of viruses. More recently it has also been found that genetically determined resistance of mice to herpesvirus infection correlated positively with the magnitude of the early local IFN-response [45, 124] , thus adding substantial support for the hypothesis that IFN does play an important role in limiting virus replication in vivo and thereby altering the cause and effects of a viral infection.",

Thus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is at least 1000 fold more sensitive than is BHV-1. Recently some variability in sensitivity of different BHV-1 strains was observed but none of them were nearly as sensitive as was VSV [49] . These findings corroborate the in vivo findings, where maximal IFN-titers in nasal secretion of BHV-1 challenged calves occur simultaneously with maximal virus-titers [20, 75, 113] , and exogenous BolFN applied intranasally prior to nasal challenge with BHV-1 does not reduce replication to any significant degree, indicating the insensitivity of BHV-1 in vivo to the direct antiviral effects of BolFN [4, 11] . Most other viruses, reputedly involved in respiratory disease in cattle, show moderate to high sensitivity to natural and recombinant BolFNs in vitro [4, 49] . However, the in vivo results of Cummins and Rosenquist [35, 36] suggest that care must be exercised when extrapolating in vitro results to what might be expected in vivo. This is probably a result of the direct and indirect effects which occur in vivo.",

The majority of the studies in this area have been conducted using in vitro systems [41, 65] . With the advent of pure cloned IFN in a variety of species as well as the initiation of clinical trials employing IFN, its in vivo immunomodulatory effects are now being intensively investigated both in experimental systems and clinical settings. Using these systems, it will be possible to determine whether those effects observed in vitro in isolated systems also occur in vivo where various parameters of the immune system interact and counteract [18, 19] . However, valuable information must still be retrieved from the in vitro systems, where the single components of the intricate web of the immune defence can be dissected and evaluated separately as well as in combination. These in vitro studies will help us to more judiciously design in vivo experiments to produce the desired effect for specific application, i.e. specific disease situations. Once these are conducted, final confirmation of any conclusion must eventually be based on in vivo findings.",

When it was found that preventive treatment of calves with rBoIFN had a very beneficial effect on the clinical performance in experimental Shipping Fever without significantly reducing virus replication in the nasal cavity [10] , studies were initiated to elucidate the non-antiviral effects of BoIFNs, which might potentially contribute to these observations.",

The efficiency whereby they can combat the intruders may depend on such functions as migration, generation and release of reactive oxygen species, e.g. hydrogen peroxide (H202) and superoxide anions (o~), lysosomal enzymes, expression of surface receptors for immunoglobulin (Fc-R) and complement (C-R), secretion of IFN and prostaglandins (PG), phagocytosis and cellular cytotoxicity. Most of these activities of bovine cells can be modulated by in vitro treatment of the cells with rBolFN-a 1 or -~/ ( Table 2) , and those functions so far examined are also subject to in vivo modulation (Table 1) . However, the effect of the IFN-exposure appears to be very dependent on dose, exposure time and the health status of the animal, i.e. whether clinically healthy or infected with virus (or virus plus bacteria [17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25] . The influence of the latter is so dramatic as to give completely opposite results when, for example, migration and O~-generation by PMN are evaluated [18, 22] . At the present time, there are no explanations to these discrepancies, but most likely a plethora of endogenous factors, released during a virus infection, will somehow change the effect of the exogenous IFN. Another explanation could be that what we consider beneficial with respect to the in vitro situation may not be beneficial in vivo. For example, although production of oxygen reactive species may be important in killing bacteria it may also lead to tissue damage and enhanced pathology. Furthermore these molecules may be a reflection of the severity of disease and therefore, there should be an inverse relationship between cellular activation and disease. No influence of age of the donor animal has so far been detected regarding sensitivity to IFN-modulation. Neither has an influence of the animals genetic make-up [40] been observed with certainty in the bovine species, although it has been suspected to play a role on some occasions (unpublished data). Further insight into this aspect may have to await better characterization of the immune response genes in the bovine species [39] or other genetic factors influencing the expression of IFN or IFN induced proteins.",

The indications are that this defence-mechanism may be of importance in antiviral defence [28] . In the bovine species, cells exerting natural cytotoxicity against xenogeneic tumor cells as well as against BHV-1 infected bovine fibroblasts reside within or are more closely related to the M+-lineage [24] . As in other species, their activity is highly susceptible to in vitro and in vivo modulation by IFNs [19] with responses being increased upon exposure to rBolFN. The exact mechanism whereby IFNs modulate NC activity and whether in vitro and in vivo modulation occurs by the same mechanisms remains to be determined. Thus, endogenous in vivo factors which are not present in vitro may modulate the effect of the exogenous BoIFNs. The in vivo enhancing effect of rBoIFNs on NC-activity may involve a direct or indirect influence on the bone marrow, i.e., the development and recruitment of effector cells [19] . Thus, although both rBoIFN-u 1 and -~/in vitro have a dose-dependent suppressive effect on the proliferation of bone marrow cells of the Mqb-lineage, there seems to be a partially selective expansion of a certain subset of bone marrow Mob, which share phenotypic (i.e., antigenic) characteristics with the NC cells in peripheral blood [19, and unpublished data] .",

            "text": "When healthy calves are treated intravenously or intramuscularly with rBoIFNoq or -% the mitogen proliferative-response of PBL is reduced 24 h later. Addition of interleukin-2 (IL-2) to the in vitro cultures can partly or completely prevent this suppression [22] . In contrast, at later times (2-4 days after treatment) the proliferative response of PBL to Con A and PHA is actually enhanced. Although the in vivo effect of the two IFNs is similar, their effect differs when they are added to in vitro PBL cultures from normal non-treated animals. Thus, over a concentration range of rBoIFN-~/the modulation of the Con A and PHA responses varies from enhancement (low doses) to suppression (high doses). The suppressive effect can be completely reverted by addition of exogenous IL-2, which could indicate that the suppressive effect is exerted by either inhibition of mitogen stimulated IL-2 production in the cultures or by stimulating cells which compete for IL-2 binding, but without exhibiting a proliferative response. In contrast, BoIFN-~1 if used at the same dose range as BoIFN-~/only suppresses the PHA and Con Aresponses of PBL, but as with rBoIFN-~/suppression, this can be overcome by addition of IL-2 [22] . The difference between the two IFN-types may illustrate their different physiological roles. Thus, since IFN-~ is actually produced in mitogenstimulated lymphocyte (T cells) cultures, it is tempting to speculate that IFN serves as an initial enhancer, but later as a feed-back control mechanism to shut off proliferation to prevent overreaction of the immune response. Recombinant human IFN has also been found to suppress proliferation of bovine PBL, but the effect seems somewhat capricious and dependent on serum source and the individual animal [30] . Using cloned or bulk bovine T cells, we have demonstrated that c~ 1 interferon can inhibit their proliferation and responsiveness to IL-2 (unpublished data).",

            "text": "In exploration of the mechanism(s) involved in IFN-suppression of mitogenstimulated lymphocyte proliferation, the effect of rBoIFN-~ or --y on the Con A induced IL-2 generation was investigated. Although these results are preliminary there appeared to be enhanced IL-2 generation following in vivo exposure. In contrast, no consistent effect could be seen after in vitro exposure (unpublished data). Activation of suppressor cells by IFNs has been reported in other animal systems [6] and this possibility was therefore considered. In vitro treatment of bovine M+ with either BolFN-a or --\u00a2 did not endow them with suppressive activity. On the contrary, it enhanced their accessory cell activity, at least as applied to the mitogen response [25] . In contrast, a suppressor cell with lymphocyte characteristics was induced by high doses of rBolFN-a 1, or -~/within a few hours of exposure [22] . It remains to be elucidated how this suppressor cell exerts its activity. Although no inhibitory effect of rBolFN-treatment on the antibody response to viral antigens has been detected [10] , both rBolFN-eh, and -[3 have a profound effect on the in vitro secondary antibody response (Filion et al., unpublished data) (Fig. 1) . The mechanism of suppression has not yet been studied in the bovine system, but in the human system it was shown to be due to a direct anti-proliferative effect of IFNs rather than via an intermediary suppressor cell mechanism [41] . It remains to be investigated what effect BolFN-~/ might have on the bovine antibody-producing cell responses. In the murine system IFN-~/was found to enhance the response by acting as a cofactor in driving the maturation of resting B cells to active immunoglobulin secretions [74, 106] . If this mechanism also occurs in vivo the implications for a beneficial effect of combined immunization (vaccination) and IFN-~/treatment are considerable.",

Preliminary results suggest that this may indeed be the case (unpublished data). Based on these observations, studies need to be conducted with respect to timing of treatment as well as dose or dose combinations. This may be especially important in such infections as bovine respiratory diseases where different effects would be needed for induction of activity to the viruses, and bacteria that are involved in this disease complex. This is especially true when BHV-1 is employed as in vivo test virus, because of the apparent negligible effect of IFN on viral replication in the nasal cavity [10,11,34--36,110,113] . Thus, other parameters such as the overall clinical performance (i.e., severity and duration of symptoms) of the animal may prove a better measure of the value of IFN-therapy [11] , at least as it applies to bovine respiratory disease.",

            "text": "A second economically important disease where active immunization is not feasible is in neonatal diarrhea. In this instance the disease occurs within the first 2-3 wk of life. This disease is caused by a wide variety of different agents including rotavirus, coronavirus, breda virus, astroviruses, caliciviruses, parvoviruses, and possibly other unidentified viral agents, as well as enterotoxigenic E. coli. The only feasible methods of controlling these agents involve oral feeding of specific antibody containing milk or monoclonal antibodies against either the bacteria or the specific viruses [6b]. Since there are so many different viruses presently identified as agents involved in induction of neonatal diarrhea, specific chemotherapeutic methods do not appear to have any potential role in inhibiting virus replication. Thus IFN, with its broad spectrum of antiviral activity, appears to be the ideal candidate for making cells refractory to virus infection and therefore, could dramatically reduce economic losses due to neonatal diarrhea. At present there is at least one report [120] wherein intramuscular treatment of calves with human IFNet decreased symptoms of rotavirus diarrhea, but did not alter virus excretion. These initial observations appear promising and hopefully improvements in efficacy could be achieved by better administration methods and doses. Since all of the agents causing neonatal calf diarrhea are generally restricted to the intestinal epithelium of the gastrointestinal tract, it is possible that administration of the IFN into the intestinal tract to provide a refractory antiviral state, would even prove to be more efficacious than systemic administration. This is especially important since all of these viruses produce diarrhea very rapidly and the disease process is very localized. However, before these types of studies can be accepted in the field, considerable experimentation will have to be conducted to determine whether IFN application locally in the intestine will alter gut physiology and whether replication of the crypt cells will be affected [86] . If this occurs, IFN may itself induce diarrhea or alter adsorption as well as influence the immune system. Another consideration that must be taken into account in the treatment of calves with IFN against enteric infections, is that the refractory state will have to be maintained for approximately 3 wk, until a time when most calves have reached an age where their susceptibility to these enteric infections is reduced. In order to achieve this continued refractory state, sufficient levels of IFN will have to be maintained in the gut for extended periods. It also remains to be determined whether the IFN can withstand the proteolytic enzymes within the jejunum and ileum, the site where the majority of the viruses replicate. If the proteolytic enzymes do degrade IFN, then novel approaches of systemic release and transport to the intestinal surface over extended periods will be required. Thus, it is evident that many questions still need to be addressed before the application of IFN in neonatal diarrhea can be used with guarantee for efficacy and security.",

Different virus types may differ in their sensitivity to the VAb-IFN combinations, depending on the IFN type [71] .
