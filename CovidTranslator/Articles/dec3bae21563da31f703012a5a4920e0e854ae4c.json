Interestingly, excretion of BRSV antigen and development of clinical symptoms were not affected by the presence of pre-existing antibodies. It has previously been shown that IgG1 transferred via colostrum may suppress the development of antibodies to BRSV and that the presence of very high levels of passive immunity has also been found to prevent virus shedding, clinical symptoms and lung changes (Kimman et al., 1987a; Belknap et al., 1991) . Generally the immune responses to BRSV seemed to be independent of the age of the calf in contrast to earlier studies suggesting that the age of the calves being critical for the duration of the IgM response (Kimman et al., 1987b) . Thus, in the present study the suppressive effect seemed to depend on the presence of pre-existing BRSV-speci\u00aec antibodies rather than age.",

Accordingly the level of antibodies to BRSV was high in young calves born into herds with recurrent cases of pneumonia (herd A and B). The maternal immunity was con\u00aermed to be solely of the IgG1 isotype, since no passively transferred IgM or IgG2 antibodies were detected. The IgG1 and the neutralising antibodies decreased over the initial 4 months with identical slopes if a new infection was not introduced into the herd. Coronavirus antibodies decreased for a few months then a natural infection interfered. The half-lives of the maternally derived antibodies against BRSV and coronavirus were, however, identical with a half-life of approximately 26 days. This \u00aegure is slightly higher than the 23 days previously found for passively transferred BRSV antibodies (Kimman et al., 1987b) .

In a slightly different study all bulk milk samples obtained during June to December from 341 herds in England and Wales contained antibodies to BRSV (Paton et al., 1998) , suggesting a similar high herd prevalence in UK as in Denmark. Accordingly, 54% of the samples had BRSV speci\u00aec antibodies of both IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes. The presence of cattle with IgG1 but no IgG2 probably represent newly infected animal or animals with residues of maternally derived antibodies, whereas the very limited number (6.6%) of IgG1 negative and IgG2 positive cattle may be convalescent animals having lost their IgG1. Unfortunately the age of the speci\u00aec animal was not provided; thus a more detailed comparison of age and isotypes was not possible.",
