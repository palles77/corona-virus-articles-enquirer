In March 2020, members of the Republican and Democratic 5 parties introduced cash transfers as part of a coronavirus stimulus package, illustrating 6 that the concept of cash transfers and guaranteed income (GI) programs have moved out 7 of the research space and into the policy conversation (Grunwald, 2020) . Nonetheless, to 8 date, neither the proposed stimulus package nor other GI policy proposals discuss how 9 these influxes of cash will or will not interact with means tested benefits and income 10 thresholds, leaving some households at risk of preserving their financial stability at the 11 expense of their access to health insurance and other benefits (Identifying Author). In the 12 midst of an unprecedented crisis and a surge of GI experiments, the field of public health 13 and allied disciplines are ideally situated to lead the policy community in developing 14 models that assist policy makers in ensuring that cash transfer interventions and GI 15 experiments preserve benefits rather than produce new forms of inequality.

Often absent from research attention (Rehner Iversen, 83 2000), these barriers can generate cascading effects on program outcomes and produce, 84 rather than eliminate, inequalities (Identifying Author). 85 POLICY LANDSCAPE 86 Given the recent proliferation in GI pilots in the US (Jain Family Institute, 2019), 87 including recent announcements of pilots in Chicago (Chicago Resilient Families Task 88 Force, 2019), Jackson (Economic Security Project, 2019), Philadelphia (Blumgart, 2020), 89 and Newark (Crowe, 2019), it is essential to bring awareness to what, at this point, is 90 essentially a policy and implementation gray space carrying competing sets of mandates 91and ethical dilemmas.

            "text": "Option two, espoused by Yang, is predicated on Milton Friedman's ideal GI 100 structure, whereby cash transfers are designed to completely replace all means tested 101 benefits under the auspices of improved government efficiency and enhanced work 102 incentives for recipients (Moffett, 2003). Friedman's proposal was intended to be tested 103 in the Seattle-Denver Income Maintenance Experiment (SIME/DIME), one of the largest 104 negative income experiments of the 1970s. Members of the experimental group already 105 receiving cash welfare were required to choose monthly whether to receive cash benefits 106 from Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) or the negative income tax (US 107 Department of Health and Human Services, 1983). The intended design testing 108 SIME/DIME against existing safety net benefits was upended, as treatment group 109 members receiving AFDC would not sign over to receive the negative income tax 110 without protection of existing benefits, including health insurance, housing vouchers, and 111 subsidized childcare (Mathematica Policy Research, 1983). Thus, a GI option that fails to 112 protect against the detrimental health and financial impacts of benefits loss in the current 113 policy landscape is demonstrably infeasible. 114 Herein, we present option three, the Stockton Plan, which draws on an ethical 115 framework informed by public health and social work codes of ethics, and research 116 informed by Institutional Review Boards (IRBs). This makes SEED the first 117 contemporary pilot to bring the ethical concerns around loss of benefits to the forefront of 118 the GI policy debate, and one that can guide ethical and just implementation of GI. 119 Rather than relying on economic projections, GI pilots are taking place in real time and 120 carry real world impacts for recipients. Thus, there is a clear immediacy for public health 121 and social work professionals to uphold the ethics of the respective professions while 122 producing sound empirical evidence capable of influencing public policy. Moreover, 123 while some developing GI pilots may not be governed by human subject research 124 protections mandated by IRBs, similar ethical measures should be considered to protect 125 GI recipients within the existing policy landscape. This paper demonstrates how SEED 126 used ethical mandates of both public health and social work to attend to ethical conflicts 127 inherent in GI experimentation. We begin by describing the pilot design itself as a rubric 128 and exemplar for discussing how implementation and design decisions such as sampling, 129 recipient onboarding, and democratizing human contact effectively preserved recipient 130 benefits in the existing policy landscape. 131 THE STOCKTON PLAN: RECRUITMENT AND INTERVENTION 132 To understand how GI could exist alongside, and interact with, an existing means 133 tested welfare system, SEED captured a diverse sample of Stockton, California residents 134 recruited from census tracts at or below the City's Area Median Income (AMI) of 135 $46,033 (n=42). We selected a proportion of the population represented in each census 136 tract at random (n=4,200 households) to receive a SEED invitation mailer. After 137 removing duplicate or invalid responses from the mailed invitation (N=27), the final 138 sample at recruitment baseline was 475. Respondents meeting limited inclusion criteria 139",

Similarly, the 165 ethical principles of social work bid social workers to act honestly and responsibly and 166 promote ethical practices. This includes valuing the dignity and worth of every person by 167 promoting socially responsible self-determination, as well as recognizing the importance 168 of human relationships to enhance both community and individual well-being (National 169 Association of Social Workers [NASW], 1994). The following loss mitigation steps 170 detail implementation and research design decisions that were specifically formulated 171 with attention to ethical practice. 172 LOSS MITIGATION STEPS 173 Sampling Strategy 174 In traditional survey research design, address based samples select a household 175 member a priori, or request that the eldest member of the household, head of household, 176 or household member with the next upcoming birthday respond to the recruitment ask 177 (Battaglia et al., 2008). SEED invitation mailers were not addressed to any one person in 178 the residence typically referred to as the \"any adult\" approach. While this sampling 179 strategy may be less robust for randomization than a two-stage screener sampling strategy 180 (Battaglia et al., 2008), it represented a critical step in preserving the ethical foundations 181 of the project. 182 Specifically, a key standard of ethical public health practice requires the 183 recognition of both social interdependence and individual rights (PHLS, 2002), and 184 employment of one of the fundamental ethical standards of social work, self-185 determination, requires that social work professionals regard clients as experts on their 186 own lives (NASW, 1994). By addressing the invitation letter to \"Resident\", the individual 187 or family's right to determine who was best to respond, based on existing relationships 188 and networks within the household, financial need, use of benefits, health status, or other 189 factors, was preserved. For example, if a person receiving Supplemental Nutrition 190 Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits received the invitation mailer, she may have had a 191conversation with her partner about the potential for benefits reduction and the family 192 might have collectively determined her partner as the better fit to participate in the study.",

Participants receive introductory materials through mail or email, 196 may attend a single orientation, and have limited human engagement with the individual 197 researchers or program staff. Centering both the right to health and resources outlined by 198 public health practices (PHLS, 2002) and the importance of human relationships 199 highlighted in social work principles (NASW, 1994), SEED invited all members of the 200 treatment condition to attend an individualized onboarding session. These individual 201 meetings not only helped recipients navigate a complex benefits structure and preserve 202 access to means tested programs like health insurance provided through MediCal, but 203 also helped establish rapport and trust between the program and recipient from the outset. 204 During those onboarding meetings, a licensed clinical social worker discussed 205 with the recipient that while GI payments do not exceed the yearly gift tax limit of 206 $15,000 (Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service, 2018), as a pilot GI 207 program, SEED could not guarantee how a front-line caseworker may classify the 208 payment when certifying means tested benefits. Eligibility for benefits that use this same 209 gift criterion carried a low risk of being impacted by GI, but other benefits include gifts 210 as part of eligibility calculations.

Modeled 227 after the hold harmless provision included in the statute for the Alaska Permanent Fund 228 Dividend (Social Security Administration, 2019), this fund provides reimbursement to 229 recipients if they become ineligible for benefits due to receipt of GI. 230Democratizing Human Contact 231Valuing relationships and building trust through collaborations were key 232 components that allowed SEED to democratize human contact at all points in the pilot.233 Reducing friction in the social safety net and the threat automation and artificial 234 intelligence pose for technological unemployment are often cited as rationales for 235 introducing a universal basic income or GI (Goodin, 1992; Walker, 2016). These 236 potential shifts are already present in low-wage retail sectors where automation is 237 eliminating human contact in a variety of transactions previously marked with relational 238 interactions (Hegewisch, Childers, and Hartmann, 2019). Meanwhile, unlike early 239 research around the digital divide citing socio-economic gaps between those with access 240 to technological advances and information technology and those without (Norris, 2001), 241 the drop in the cost of technology coupled with the comparatively expensive nature of 242 human employment is rendering new questions about who is granted access to human 243 contact in their everyday lives and under what terms. As Bowles (2019) argues, \"human 244 contact is now a luxury good,\" whereby those with considerably more capital have the 245 latitude to ensure their children's education, their market transactions, their care work, 246 and medical interactions are laced with relational interactions rather than mediated 247 through screens and artificial intelligence. Part of GI's appeal is its potential to address 248 the threat of technological unemployment through a mechanism that simultaneously 249 reduces the friction of human contact required to maintain large bureaucratic structures 250 governed by means testing. Paradoxically, however, the final critical tier of mitigating 251 benefits loss, upholding ethical principles and ensuring implementation efficiency, rests 252 on the human contact and relationship building between SEED's program staff and the 253 research team. Maintaining intentional recipient engagement while navigating a fluid 254 policy landscape requires relational friction in order to preserve benefits while receiving 255 GI. 256 The intense research activities of SEED, alongside the very human nature of it, 257 have created unique partnerships among the intervention staff, research staff, and 258 recipients. The Stockton-based program officer not only ensures completion of surveys 259 on a monthly basis, but a licensed clinical social worker also checks in on the financial 260 lives and well-being of recipients. As scheduled recertification appointments for housing 261 vouchers or SNAP benefits come about, the program officer and other SEED staff remain 262 in conversation with recipients about how they are choosing to protect limited resources 263 while leveraging the $500.264",

While IRBs seek to protect human 277 subjects in research, given the lack of standard benefit eligibility requirements and 278 income calculations, they may fail to realize the potential impact of cash transfers on 279 recipients' overall resources. For pilots that are not governed by these boards, it is even 280 more important that researchers remain proactive to protect recipients by upholding 281 professional practice standards.

At 301 the same time, recipients should be encouraged to consider the costs and benefits of 302 receiving GI to ensure they do not face a penalty for collecting a cash transfer. 303Experiences from SEED can inform other GI pilots being conducted within the 304 context of the US social safety net and in the midst of a pandemic-driven economic crisis 305where cash transfers are being introduced on an unprecedented scale. While the current 306 coronavirus stimulus package proposes a single cash transfer, the scale of the package 307 creates a considerable policy precedent in an era of GI experimentation. The boundaries 308 determining which benefits are preserved and which are left to chance can inform future 309 public health research while offering public health and allied disciplines an opportunity to 310 shape research and policy. 311Table 1.
