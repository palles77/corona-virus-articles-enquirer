This vector, given intramuscularly in a single dose, induced high-level antibody titers to LcrV and gave 90-100% protection against pneumonic plague challenge in mice. This single-dose protection was significantly better than that generated by VSV expressing the non-secreted LcrV protein. Increased protection correlated with increased anti-LcrV antibody and a bias toward IgG2a and away from IgG1 isotypes. We also found that depletion of CD4 + cells, but not CD8 + cells, at the time of challenge resulted in reduced vaccine protection, indicating a role for cellular immunity in protection.",

Untreated bubonic plague can progress to a highly contagious pneumonic form of the disease that is associated with high mortality. Humans can also contract pneumonic plague by inhalation of aerosolized infectious droplets following direct contact with an infected individual, thus allowing for the rapid spread of the disease [1, 2] . With antibiotic treatments being only marginally effective [1] , the rapidly progressing and often-fatal nature of pneumonic plague poses a danger to public health worldwide. In addition, the possible intentional use of aerosolized Y. pestis or its antibiotic-resistant forms [3, 4] as bioterrorism agents looms as a threat [5] .",

            "text": "Vaccination against plague is one approach being pursued to deal with impending infection. However, a safe and effective pneumonic plague vaccine for human is not yet available in the United States [6, 7] . Current vaccine development strategies focus on a few Y. pestis antigens [7] , two major candidates being the outer capsule protein (F1) and the low calcium response protein V (LcrV), which induce good protective immune response against challenge with the pathogen [8, 9] . While vaccines based on F1 alone fail to protect against F1 \u2212 virulent strains [10] , LcrV based sub-unit vaccines confer protection against both F1 + and F1 \u2212 Y. pestis strains [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . LcrV is a 37 kDa protein essential for virulence and critical for production and translocation of the Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) into the eukaryotic cell cytosol [19, 20] . Although the mechanism of protection elicited by LcrV-based vaccines is poorly understood, a number of studies have shown that antibodies to LcrV, generated by either active or passive immunization, can protect from the disease in mouse models [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Recently, induction of LcrV-specific broad T-cell immunity has also been reported [27, 28] , but its role in protection remains to be elucidated.",

            "text": "We had previously reported the development of an experimental pneumonic plague vaccine based on an attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vector expressing Yersinia pestis LcrV protein [24] . VSV is a negative-strand RNA virus encoding five structural proteins -nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), glycoprotein (G) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L). The virus is a natural pathogen of livestock, and human infection is rare and typically asymptomatic [29] . VSV recombinants, that are attenuated for pathogenesis in mice compared to naturally occurring VSV strains [30] , can be generated from plasmid DNA [31, 32] and also cause no disease symptoms in non-human primates when given by intranasal (IN), intramuscular (IM) or oral routes [33] [34] [35] . Furthermore, VSV can accommodate large insertions of foreign genes whose expression can be controlled based on the site of gene insertion in the VSV genome [36, 37] . Such recombinants induce potent humoral and cellular immune responses in a variety of animal models [29, 38, 39] . Numerous studies have shown that recombinant VSV vectors expressing appropriate foreign antigens are highly effective experimental vaccines [24, 30, 35, [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] ].",

A previous study using a multiple-dose DNA vaccine found that the secreted form of LcrV induced improved antibody responses and better protection of mice from challenge [26] . In the present study, we have incorporated a gene encoding a secreted form of LcrV in the VSV vector (VSV-ssLcrV) and tested its efficacy as a single-dose vaccine against lethal plague challenge. The vector elicits robust antibody responses with increasing immunization dose in mice and confers complete protection against pulmonary Y. pestis challenge.

The ssLcrV coding region, containing a signal sequence (from the human plasminogen activator protein) upstream of the LcrV open reading frame (ORF), was amplified by PCR using the pBS-LcrV plasmid [24] as a template. The signal sequence was added upstream of the LcrV ORF in the forward primer.

The forward and the reverse primers respectively introduced Sal I and Nhe I restriction enzyme sites (in bold) upstream and downstream of the ssLcrV coding sequence. The PCR product was digested with Sal I and Nhe I, purified and ligated to Xho I-Nhe I digested pVSV1XN [51] to generate pVSV-ssLcrV1. Recombinant VSV expressing secreted LcrV from the first position in the VSV genome was recovered from these plasmids as described previously [31] . Briefly, Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK-21) cells were grown to 70% confluency and infected with vTF7-3 [52], a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing T7 RNA polymerase, at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 for 1 hr followed by transfection with pVSV-ssLcrV1 along with the support plasmids pBS-N, pBS-P and pBS-L. At 48 hrs post transfection, cell supernatants were passaged onto fresh BHK-21 cells. Medium containing the virus was collected after 48 hrs.

A single IN vaccination with a 10 6 pfu of VSV-ssLcrV1 generated a modestly improved protection against intranasal Y. pestis challenge when compared to VSV-LcrV1 (not shown). To determine if better protection could be obtained using a higher immunizing dose, we initiated a dose response study. Previous studies with VSV vectors have shown little effect of virus dose when given intranasally [37], but substantial effects of dose when given by the intramuscular (IM) route (S. Kapadia and J.K.

To examine a potential role of CD4 + and CD8 + cells in VSV-ssLcrV1 vaccinated mice at the time of challenge we depleted these cells singly or together just before challenge and then determined the extent of protection. A control experiment was performed to evaluate the extent of depletion using mouse specific MAbs. Figure 7 shows representative FACS plots of splenocytes, obtained from mice injected intraperitonealy (IP) with anti-mCD4, anti-CD8 or isotype control MAbs and, stained with appropriately conjugated rat anti-mouse CD4 or CD8 antibodies. Relative to an isotype control MAb treated mouse, anti-mCD4 and/or anti-mCD8 MAb treatment resulted in a nearly complete, specific depletion of CD4 + and/or CD8 + cells in mice, confirming the efficiency of the depletion (Fig. 7) . Figure 8A gives the plan and timeline for the depletion/challenge study. Four groups of ten mice each (groups A-D) were given 10 9 pfu of VSV-ssLcrV1 by the IM route, while ten control mice received similar doses of VSV-eGFP1. The CD4 + and/or CD8 + cells were depleted in some of these immunization groups with injection (IP) of MAbs specific for mouse CD4 and/ or mouse CD8 as indicated (Fig. 8A) , followed by pulmonary Y. pestis challenge approximately 3 months post vaccination. Complete protection [p = 0.03 (Fisher Exact Test), as compared to VSV-eGFP1 vaccinated mice] was obtained in the VSV-ssLcrV1 vaccinated animals, which received the isotype control MAb (group A) or the anti-mCD8 MAb (group C), as shown in Fig. 8B . In contrast, two groups of vaccinated mice that received the anti-mCD4 MAb, with or without depletion of CD8+ cells (groups B and D), elicited significantly reduced [p=0.02 (Fisher Exact Test)] levels of protection (70%). Note that greater statistical significance was achieved in the latter case because there were more animals involved in this calculation. Surprisingly, one out of the ten control animals survived the challenge. In our previous studies of mice given this challenge, all control mice (n=35) had died by day 4 or 5 post challenge.",

Compared to the VSV-LcrV1 vector (expressing non-secreted LcrV), that we described earlier [24] the vector expressing secreted LcrV (VSV-ssLcrV1) gave significantly better single-dose protection. Immunization with VSV-ssLcrV1 also elicited higher IgG2a relative to IgG1 titers suggestive of a shift toward a T h 1 type of immune response to the secreted protein.",

Together these results suggested a possible cellular immune component in protection. Recently, immunizations with live replicating Y. pestis have also shown the importance of cell-mediated immunity in protection against plague challenge [55, 56] .

To determine if we could identify a role for cellular immunity in protection, we performed selective depletion of mouse CD4 + and/or CD8 + T-cells at the time of challenge. Mice completely depleted for CD8 + T-cells prior to challenge were 100% protected from disease indicating that CD8 + T-cells are not required for protection. However, depletion of CD4 + T-cells, with or without depletion of CD8 + T cells, significantly reduced the level of protection. This result suggests that CD4 + T-cells might be involved in protection, although effects on other CD4 + cells cannot be ruled out. Effects on antibody production are unlikely because the depletion is performed just prior to challenge. Consistent with our findings, CD4 + T-cell epitopes have been reported for the LcrV protein in Balb/c mice [57] , while CD8 + T-cell epitopes have not been defined.",

Vaccine induced CD4 + T-cells are known to secrete phagocyte activating type 1 cytokines like interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), which contribute to intracellular antimicrobial defense by activating macrophages [58, 59] . However, although intracellular niches of Y. pestis exist, pulmonary plague infection is considered predominantly extracellular. Some recent studies suggest that both CD4 + T cells and IFN-\u03b3 play critical roles in combating extracellular bacterial infections [60, 61] . Other studies imply important roles for IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in protection against lethal Y. pestis infections [62, 63] . Thus depletion of vaccine primed CD4 + T-cells leading to abrogation of the cytokine secreting activity, might be reflected in the reduced level of protection that we have observed. In addition, the role of cytotoxic CD4 + T-cells in eliminating infected cells also cannot be ruled out.",
