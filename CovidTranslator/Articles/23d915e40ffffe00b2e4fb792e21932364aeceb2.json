            "text": "We herein report the application of the phosphorodiamidate phosphate prodrug approach to a series of thirteen nucleoside analogs with antiviral or anticancer activity. Twenty-five symmetrical phosphorodiamidates were synthesized, bearing esterified L-Alanine (and in one case D-alanine) in the prodrug moiety, each as single stereoisomer. The presence of an achiral phosphorus represents a potential advantage over the phosphoramidate ProTide approach, where diastereoisomeric mixtures are routinely obtained, and different biological profiles may be expected from the diastereoisomers. Optimization of the synthetic pathway allowed us to identify two general methods depending on the particular nucleoside analogs. All the compounds were biologically evaluated in antiviral and anticancer assays and several showed improvement of activity compared to their parent nucleosides, as in the case of ddA, d4T, abacavir and acyclovir against HIV-1 and/or HIV-2. The biological results were supported by metabolism studies with carboxypeptidase Y monitored by 31 P NMR to investigate their bioactivation. This work further validates the phosphorodiamidate approach as a monophosphate prodrug motif with broad application in the antiviral and anticancer fields.",

            "text": "Nucleoside analogs (NAs) play a pivotal role in antiviral and anticancer therapy [1, 2] . They are structurally related to the natural nucleosides bearing modifications at the base and/or at the sugar moieties, which, in most of the cases, confer selectivity versus the desired targets [2] . NAs are prodrugs and they need to be converted into their active species, which usually consists of their 5\u2032-triphosphate form [3] . Their bioactivation pathway often involves three consecutive phosphorylation steps starting from the parent nucleoside, which is converted to its mono-, di-and finally triphosphate form. Some NAs, such as abacavir or famciclovir for instance, require also additional bioactivation steps in order to display their biological activity [4, 5] . The first step of phosphorylation is usually considered to be the rate-limiting step in the bioactivation of NAs, with few exceptions, such as zidovudine for which the second phosphorylation may be rate limiting [6] . After long-term treatment with NAs the activity of the nucleoside kinases involved in the first step of bioactivation may be decreased, therefore leading to drug resistance onset [7] . Several monophosphate prodrug strategies are currently under investigations to overcome these issues [8] , including the phosphoramidate ProTide approach developed in our group [9] [10] [11] . More recently the phosphorodiamidate technology applied to 6-O-alkyl-2\u2032-C-methylguanosine was reported by us as a new promising approach for the delivery of monophosphates inside the cell. Several stability studies on the 6-O-alkyl-2\u2032-C-methylguanosine diamidates have shown a good stability profile under different conditions such as acid (pH = 2) and mild basic buffer (pH = 8. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , and in human serum [12] . This novel prodrug approach has been validated both in vitro and in vivo and some compounds are already under consideration for clinical studies [12] . Similarly, several acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diamidate prodrugs showed a better biological profile compared to the parent compounds [13] . In this approach two amino acid esters are introduced on the monophosphate moiety in order to mask the negative charges. As also in the case of the phosphoramidate diester approach of Wagner and colleagues [14] , the phosphorus in the symmetrical diamidate prodrug is achiral, thus avoiding the presence of diastereoisomeric mixtures as in the case of the phosphoramidate ProTide derivatives. In fact, it has been reported how two diastereoisomers may interact differently with the enzymes involved in the bioactivation pathway, thus leading to different biological profiles [15] . Moreover, the diamidate motif bears non-toxic and natural promoieties and obviate the need for a phenyl or naphthyl moiety. The putative bioactivation pathway of diamidate prodrugs, depicted in Scheme 1, is similar to the one reported for ProTides. The first step (a) may be mediated by an esterase or a carboxypeptidase-type enzyme, which is responsible for the cleavage of one of the two esters. This mechanism has been already described and supported by enzymatic experiments using 31 P NMR [12] . The second step (b) involves an intramolecular attack of the carboxylate anion to the phosphorus with elimination of the second amino acid and formation of a five-membered ring (mixed anhydride intermediate).",

Moreover, the increased lipophilicity of these prodrugs may also lead to a better delivery inside the cells by passive diffusion, thus favoring a greater uptake of the drug. For instance, it has been reported how the application of the ProTide approach greatly enhanced the antiviral activity of the antihepatitis C virus (HCV) agent 2-amino-6-methoxy-9-(2-Cmethyl-\u03b2-D-ribofuranosyl) purine, [11] overcame the mechanisms of resistance for 5fluoro-2\u2032-deoxyuridine [18] and extended the biological profile of BVdU and ACV from antiherpetic to anticancer and anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) agents, respectively [19, 20] . In a similar context, the phosphorodiamidates reported here were tested versus different cancer cell lines as well as versus a range of viruses with the aim to investigate the full potential of this phosphate prodrug moiety. To probe the delivery of the monophosphate inside the cells, thus by-passing the first step of phosphorylation, thymidine kinase-deficient (TK \u2212 ) mutant cancer cells and herpes virus strains were also used. Table 1 reports the anticancer activity for d4T (2), ddA (3), 3TC (5), N-acetyl-3TC (6), ABC (11), AICA (13) and their respective phosphorodiamidates versus mouse lymphocytic leukemia cells (L1210), human T-lymphocyte cells (CEM), human cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa), for which TK \u2212 mutant strains were also included (L1210-TK \u2212 , CEM-TK \u2212 , and HeLa-TK \u2212 ), colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco-2) and human colon carcinoma cells (Colo-320). As expected, d4T itself did not show any antiproliferative activity versus all the human cancer cell lines considered in this study. In the case of murine L1210, d4T showed cytostatic activity at ~9 \u03bcM, while it was found ineffective (\u2265250 \u03bcM) versus L1210/TK \u2212 , which confirms its expected dependence on TK for phosphorylation for eventual biological activity. To the contrary, its phosphorodiamidates 16-18 showed antiproliferative activity versus all the cancer cell lines in a range between 8.9 and 47 \u03bcM for L1210, 73-96 \u03bcM for CEM, 96-116 \u03bcM for HeLa, 30-133 \u03bcM for Colo-320, while being poorly effective versus Caco-2 cell (135-241 \u03bcM). More importantly, all the compounds showed retention of activity against all the TK \u2212 strains in a range between 7.4 and 25 \u03bcM versus L1210-TK \u2212 , 37-54 \u03bcM vs CEM-TK \u2212 , and 29-53 \u03bcM vs HeLa/TK \u2212 strains. These results are strongly suggestive for the successful delivery of d4T monophosphate inside the cells, thus heading to their independence from TK activation. As an alternative hypothesis, it could have been assumed that the similar antiproliferative activity observed for the d4T prodrugs against the L1210 TK \u2212 cells versus wild-type L1210 cells could have been due to a direct effect of the prodrug or prodrug moieties such as the released benzyl part of the molecule. However, this is highly unlikely because in such a case, these prodrugs would have expected to display similar toxicities for the different prodrug molecules (i.e. 16, 22, 24, 25) and this had not been the case.",

After 30 min from the addition of the enzyme a new peak (\u03b4 P = 7.16) appeared, which corresponds to the metabolite lacking one amino acid and one ester, in agreement with our previously published results [11, 26] .

The key advantage of this nucleoside monophosphate prodrug approach is to overcome the chirality at the phosphorus center present in other monophosphate prodrug approaches, thus allowing the formation of single stereoisomers instead of diastereoisomeric mixtures. A broad anticancer and antiviral evaluation has been performed. Many of the compounds showed a good improvement and/or extension of their biological profile. A great improvement of activity was observed in the case of ddA, ABC and ACV phosphorodiamidates against HIV-1 and 2, while d4T prodrugs showed a good inhibitory activity versus different cancer cell lines. To the contrary, AICA derivatives showed neither anticancer nor antiviral activity. A metabolic assays using carboxypeptidase Y was performed to support the importance of bioactivation of these compounds to exert their activity. In fact, when the compounds were slowly activated in our assays either a low or no activity was observed in the testing, whereas a rapid bioactivation resulted in an improved biological profile. The phosphorodiamidate approach we report shows considerable promise across the biological spectrum where NAs are active and we believe significantly augment the field of nucleotide prodrugs for use in drug discovery.",

Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC): precoated aluminum backed plates (60 F 254 , 0.2 mm thickness, Merck) were visualized under both short and long wave UV light (254 and 366 nm). Flash column chromatography was carried out using silica gel supplied by Fisher (60A, 35-70 mm). Analytical High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis was performed using either a ThermoScientific or a Varian Prostar system. 1 H NMR (500 MHz), 13 C NMR (125 MHz), 31 P NMR (202 MHz) and 19 F NMR (470 MHz) spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer at 25 \u00b0C. Chemical shifts (\u03b4) are quoted in parts per million (ppm) relative to internal MeOD (\u03b4 3.34 1 H NMR, \u03b4 49.86 13 C NMR) and CDCl 3 (\u03b4 7.26 1 H NMR, \u03b4 77.36 13 C NMR) or external 85% H 3 PO 4 (\u03b4 0.00 31 P NMR). Coupling constants (J) are given in Hertz. The following abbreviations are used in the assignment of NMR signals: s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet), qn (quintet), m (multiplet), bs (broad singlet), dd (doublet of doublet), dt (doublet of triplet). Low resolution mass spectrometry was performed on a Bruker Daltonics microTof-LC system, as a service by the School of Chemistry at Cardiff University.",

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 cell culture inhibitory dose-50 (CCID 50 ) of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures). After a 1 h virus adsorption period, residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations (200, 40, 8,. \u03bcM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. The methodology of the anti-HIV assays was as follows: human CEM (~3 \u00d7 10 5 cells/cm 3 ) cells were infected with 100 CCID 50 of HIV-1(III B ) or HIV-2(ROD)/mL and seeded in 200 mL wells of a microtiter plate containing appropriate dilutions of the test compounds. After 4 days of incubation at 37 \u00b0C, HIV-induced CEM giant cell formation was examined microscopically.
