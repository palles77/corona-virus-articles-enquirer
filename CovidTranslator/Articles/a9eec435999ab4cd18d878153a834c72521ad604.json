            "text": "Open access haematological diseases. [1] [2] [3] Allogeneic HSCT is based on the transfer of an immune system from a donor to a recipient through replacement of haematopoietic stem cells for diseases such as acute leukaemia or thalassaemia major that are otherwise refractory to treatment. Autologous HSCT is based on the reinjection of recipients' own immune system ensuing intensive chemotherapy for diseases such as multiple myeloma or aggressive lymphoma. On HSCT, recipients experience a phase of profound immunosuppression with loss of protective immunity against most infectious agents followed by gradual immune recovery. 2 4 Infections are among the most frequent complications after HSCT, and consequently, key players for recipients' outcome. 2 Indeed, infections are the second cause of death for both autologous and allogeneic HSCT beyond day 100 post-transplant. 5 Reimmunisation of HSCT recipients against vaccine-preventable infections is an important post-transplant intervention for reducing morbimortality. 6 Consistently, vaccination schedules have been proposed by various expert committees, based on epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases and the relatively few data available on efficacy, safety and effectiveness of vaccines in the HSCT setting. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] However, some studies have suggested that patients with haematological malignancies and an impaired immune status might benefit, especially for influenza, from additional vaccine doses to those recommended at present. 12 13 Therefore, addressing vaccine response obtained in HSCT recipients in a 'reallife' setting with the currently recommended vaccination schedule is an important issue. Studies have brought evidence of immune responsiveness to vaccines after HSCT, referred to as vaccine efficacy. The reference method for assessing vaccine efficacy is the measurement of serum antibody titres. Nonetheless, antibody titres do not correlate accurately with clinical protection, in addition to the issue of durability of protection. 14 Given the complexity and heterogeneity of HSCT recipients, it is unlikely that a single biomarker is sufficient to assess vaccine-induced protection. A panel of validated operational biomarkers may bring enough information to achieve such a goal. Moreover, immune recovery is a highly dynamic process, and it is unlikely that all recipients fit into a single pattern of reimmunisation: on the one hand, some HSCT recipients, according to their functional immune status, might require delayed initiation of their reimmunisation schedule and/or higher amounts of vaccine antigens (ie, multiple vaccine doses) to improve response to vaccination. On the other hand, some HSCT recipients with rapid and goodquality immune reconstitution might benefit from an earlier implementation of the vaccination schedule. The various pretransplant and post-transplant factors influencing immune recovery and immunisation response might consequently be included in more personalised post-transplant vaccination schedules.",

The supernatant will be stored at \u221280\u00b0C until batch serial quantification of cytokines tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) with Simple plex cartridges (ProteinSimple, San Jose, California, USA) using the ELLA platform (ProteinSimple).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated from fresh, heparinized blood samples by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation (U-04; Eurobio, Les Ulis, France) and will be incubated with culture medium overnight. Then, PBMCs will be stimulated in duplicate with PHA at 4 \u00b5g/mL (R30852801; Remel, Oxoid, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) in a 96-well cell culture plate at 37\u00b0C for 72 hours. On incubation, supernatant will be harvested for IFN-\u03b3 quantification using the ELLA platform.

Open access dIsCussIon strengths and limitations of the VacchemInf study design The interest in designing a prospective cohort including all consecutive adult HSCT recipients who complete the vaccination schedule and have the full prevaccination and postvaccination assessments, independently of their complications and immunomodulatory therapy, is to test such a schedule in a 'real-life' setting. Another interest is the assessment of antibody titres at 24 months after vaccination, which has not been documented so far. We acknowledge the biases that contribute to overestimate the serum antibody concentrations: first, the heterogeneity in timing of recipient inclusion referred on referent haematologist's signal. The later after HSCT, the better immune recovery; second, some recipients receive intravenous Igs after transplantation, which may overestimate assessment of serological response to vaccines. We also acknowledge the bias due to the serology methods, notably for pneumococcus, which may be optimised through alternative methods such as the measurement of specific IgG 2 antibodies or in vitro opsonisation test.",

Precisely here, the variables collected in the database will potentially have an impact on the immune function, consequently altering the readout, interpretation, specificity and sensitivity of the assays. The Milieu Interieur Consortium has set up preliminary reference ranges of a healthy immune response and its natural variance. 41 Similarly, in order to map the immune disorders, the 30 healthy donors of the VaccHemInf study will provide a reference panel essential for the evaluation of the 'in-range' or 'out-range' scale. In addition, the duration of the follow-up for this current project will last 24 months for a population of patients closely monitored by their referent physicians, with virtually no loss to follow-up. An added value might be to extend the duration of follow-up up to 5 years, on recipient's agreement, to sustain the quality of information. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that a potential confounder will be the important number of collected variables with a sample size that may not allow complex analysis or may likely be statistically underpowered. In order to assess the impact of functional immune status on vaccine response of HSCT recipients, a multicentre study with a larger number of patients is planned in the future.
