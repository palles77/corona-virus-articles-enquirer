Despite of their potential significance as promising vaccine candidates, the protein composition of VLPs produced in insect cells has not been well characterized. Here we report a proteomic analysis of influenza VLPs containing hemagglutinin (HA) and matrix M1 proteins from a human isolate of avian influenza H5N1 virus (H5 VLPs) produced in insect cells using the recombinant baculovirus expression system. Comprehensive proteomic analysis of purified H5 VLPs identified viral proteins and 37 additional host-derived proteins, many of which are known to be present in other enveloped viruses. Proteins involved in different cellular structures and functions were found to be present in H5 VLPs including those from the cytoskeleton, translation, chaperone, and metabolism. Immunization with purified H5 VLPs induced protective immunity, which was comparable to the inactivated whole virus containing all viral components. Unpurified H5 VLPs containing excess amounts of non-influenza soluble proteins also conferred 100% protection against lethal challenge although lower immune responses were induced. These results provide important implications consistent with the idea that VLP production in insect cells may involve similar cellular machinery as other RNA enveloped viruses during synthesis, assembly, trafficking, and budding processes.",

Based on World Health Organization reports (http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs211), it is estimated that seasonal influenza epidemics affect 5 to 15% of the global population annually and are responsible for more than 3-5 million hospitalizations and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths per year. Influenza virus circulating in various reservoirs including humans, birds, and pigs shows continuous mutation, which provides a source for the emergence of novel strains. For example, the novel swine-origin 2009 H1N1 influenza virus was declared to be the first pandemic in the 21 st century. Since the emergence of a highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus in Hong Kong in 1997, recurrent outbreaks of avian influenza viruses (H5N1) pose a greater threat because human cases were shown to have high mortality up to 60%, which is 100 to 1000 fold higher compared to seasonal influenza viruses (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza).",

The current licensed influenza vaccines are mainly manufactured in the fertilized chicken eggs as a production system. This method of vaccine manufacturing capacity is restricted by the availability of eggs, which may be insufficient to meet the urgent requirements for vaccine during pandemic outbreaks of influenza 1, 2 . Pandemic potential H5N1 virus inactivated vaccines were shown to induce antibodies that protect ferrets or nonhuman primates, and to be safe and tolerable in human trials [3] [4] [5] [6] . In addition, the efficacy of live attenuated H5N1 influenza virus vaccines has been proved in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primate models [7] [8] [9] . Currently licensed vaccines induce antibodies primarily to the viral HA and display lower protective rates in the elderly and may be poorly immunogenic in young children 1, 10, 11 . Therefore, the development of effective vaccines using alternative technologies is highly needed to meet the demand for pandemic influenza preparedness and surge capacity following a newly identified pandemic influenza outbreak.",

Briefly, to generate the rBVs expressing the influenza H5 HA protein, a full length HA cDNA was derived from influenza H5N1 virus (A/Indonesia/05/2005), cloned into pFastBac, and then transferred into Bacmid recombinant BV DNA (rAcNPV) by transformation with DH10Bac cells. This H5 HA protein contains a deletion of polybasic amino acids in the cleavage site. The rBV expressing influenza H5 HA protein was generated by bacmid transfection with sf9 insect cells and harvested from culture supernatant 2 days post transfection. To generate influenza H5 VLP, SF9 insect cells were co-infected with rBVs expressing HA and M1 proteins at a multiplication of infection of 3 and 1 respectively. Approximately 36 hours after infection of SF9 cells with rBVs, culture media containing released VLPs were collected and clarified by low speed centrifugation (2,000 \u00d7 g, 30min, 4 \u00b0C). Culture supernatants were concentrated and filtrated by Quixstand bench-top system (GE Healthcare) using a hollow fiber cartridge of 300 kDa molecular weight cut-off. Further purification was performed by 30% and 60% sucrose layer gradient ultracentrifugation (28,000 \u00d7 g, for 60 min). The protein concentration of H5 VLPs was quantified by a protein assay kit (Bio-rad, Irvine, CA) and biological activity was determined by a hemagglutination assay as previously described 19 . Briefly, the highest dilution factor of H5 VLP samples or inactivated H5N1 virus that prevents aggregated precipitation of 1% horse erythrocytes was determined to present hemagglutination activity units (HAU) as an indicator of vaccine activity 29 .",

Host cells and cell debris were removed from culture supernatants by centrifugation and this clarified preparation of H5 VLPs showed a significant HA titer of 776 per mg total VLP protein prior to purification processes (unpurified H5 VLPs) ( Table 1 ). As shown in Table 1 , the growth media contained a high level of non-influenza viral proteins. To remove soluble proteins and to concentrate VLPs, we performed ultra-filtration using a hollow fiber filter cartridge with molecular weight cut-off value of 3,000,000 Da. Based on the quantification of total VLP proteins, we found that more than 80% of non-viral proteins and 90% of the volume of culture supernatants were removed during the partial purification processes of re-circulating filtration and concentration (Table 1 ). There was no HA activity in the eluted solution from the hollow fiber cartridge, indicating that the HA activity is associated with VLPs. To obtain highly purified influenza H5 VLPs, the concentrated VLP solution was loaded on discontinuous sucrose density gradients and a visible white band was collected from 30% and 60% sucrose layers after ultra-centrifugation. Finally approximately 99.5 % (3283 of 3300 mg) of proteins present in the initial unpurified H5 VLPs were removed during the purification processes (Table 1 ). In contrast, most of the HA activity was preserved in the recollected fluid and the unit HA activity (per mg total VLP protein) increased about 167 fold during the purification processes (Table 1) . Therefore, rBV expressed HA proteins in insect cells are likely to be targeted onto the SF9 cell membrane and incorporated into VLPs in a functionally active form. These results suggest that VLPs are easily purified to high quality by removing over 99% of non-particulate proteins present in the culture supernatants.",

Different levels of purity of H5 VLP preparations used for immunization were shown in Table 1 . Also, a control group of mice that was immunized with inactivated whole H5N1 virus produced from fertilized egg substrates was included as a comparative control (Fig. 2) . The doses of H5 VLPs and inactivated H5N1 virus vaccines were normalized based on the amount of HA, which is equivalent to 30 HAU in PBS. Mouse sera were collected at 4 weeks post single immunization and the levels of virus specific antibodies were determined by ELISA. All groups of VLP-vaccinated mice induced robust antibody responses specific to H5N1 influenza virus. Nonetheless, we observed differences among groups immunized with H5 VLPs containing different levels of noninfluenza components. There were decreases in IgG antibody responses in groups of mice immunized with unpurified VLPs (p=0.011) or partially purified VLPs (p= 0.045) compared to the group of purified VLPs that showed the highest level of antibodies specific to H5N1 virus ( Fig. 2A) . Importantly, immunization with H5 VLPs induced virus-specific antibodies at similar or higher levels compared to those by inactivated whole H5N1 virus. Interestingly, it was noted that partially purified VLPs also elicited levels of antibody responses which were not statistically different compared to purified inactivated virus vaccine.",

In contrast, influenza VLPs produced in mammalian cells were previously demonstrated to elicit IgG1 isotype antibody predominantly 34 .

At 5 weeks after a single dose of immunization, mice were challenged with a lethal dose (5MLD 50 ) of homologous H5N1 virus. After infection with a given dose, na\u00efve mice showed a severe loss of body weight and all died. In contrast, both groups of mice that received a single dose of highly purified or partially purified H5 VLPs showed no loss in body weight and were 100% protected as observed in the inactivated whole virus group (Fig.  3) . Meanwhile, the group of mice immunized with unpurified H5 VLPs displayed a moderate loss in body weight up to 8% transiently (Fig. 3A) and then recovered to normal weight although 100% mice in this group survived (Fig. 3B) . These results suggest that both highly and partially purified H5 VLPs provide comparable protective immunity as the inactivated whole viral vaccine, and that even a single dose of unpurified H5 VLPs can provide 100% survival protection in a mouse model.",

It is important to note that of these 37 insect cell proteins identified in this study, 22 have been reported to be present in other types of enveloped virus particles (Table 2) , despite using different cell types, diverse viruses, and different analytical methods. These viruses and VLPs seem to share a fundamental feature, suggesting that these host proteins may be involved in the processes of virus and VLP production. This common feature is that all these viruses and VLPs are produced by budding, resulting in the acquisition of an envelope derived from host cells. A possible explanation is that some host proteins that are found to be commonly incorporated may play a role in particular stages during the formation of enveloped viruses and VLPs. It is also likely that VLPs are produced and released into culture supernatants by following a common or similar cellular pathway as other enveloped viruses.",

The reported viruses include human immunodeficiency (HIV-1) 40 35 . Viral proteins of VLPs are produced in the cytosol of host cells. Incorporation of viral proteins into VLPs may be dependent on cellular transportation machinery which consists of cytoskeletal and vesicular trafficking proteins as shown in Table 2 . For example, cytoskeletal proteins were found in virions of HIV-1 40 , and \u03b1/\u03b2 tubulins in several enveloped viruses including influenza virus and VLPs 34, 35 .

For example, proteins involved in vesicular trafficking/actin cytoskeleton, translation, enzymes, and protein folding were observed with various isoforms in the same fraction (Table 2) . Also, structural and capsid viral proteins were detected more than once in the same or different molecular fractions (Table 3 ). It is speculated that multiple isoform proteins of similar or different sizes are involved in host cellular functions and viral protein production, assembly, trafficking, budding and release. This phenomenon was similarly reported in previous studies on viral particle and infected host cell proteomics 34, 40, 50 .",

            "text": "It is important to determine the effects of non-influenza components on protective vaccine efficacy since many vaccines contain heterogeneous components in addition to the vaccine antigenic targets. Unpurified H5 VLPs contain over 160 fold more non-VLP proteins compared to the purified VLPs used for proteomic analysis. Most of non-influenza proteins in unpurified or partially purified proteins originated from the culture media (Table 1) . The presence of excess media proteins in VLP vaccines seems to moderately interfere with immune responses and slightly lower the protective efficacy as shown by weight loss. It is possible that an excess of non-influenza proteins may decrease the effective interactions of HA antigen with immune cells. In support of this possibility, partially purified H5 VLPs (35 fold more non-influenza proteins compared to purified VLPs) induced similar protective efficacy despite lower levels of antibody responses. Also, we observed that vaccination with 3 -4 fold higher doses of unpurified H5 VLPs induced complete protection without any loss in body weight (data not shown).",

Despite the presence of host and vector derived proteins, the H5 VLP vaccine conferred higher or non-inferior protective efficacy compared to the whole inactivated viral vaccine. Split vaccines are a more common format for seasonal vaccination in the US and are known to be less immunogenic compared to a whole viral vaccine 51, 52 . Our preliminary studies suggest that rBV-derived influenza VLP vaccines are superior to licensed split vaccine in inducing protective immunity (data not shown). In addition, rBV-derived VLPs were demonstrated to activate innate immune cells such as dendritic cells [53] [54] [55] . Importantly, this study shows that rBV-derived VLPs elicited IgG2a dominant isotype antibodies indicative of T helper type 1 immune responses in contrast to the mammalian produced VLPs 34 . IgG2a antibody is known to interact efficiently with complement and Fc receptors by virtue of its Fc domain properties contributing to effective viral clearance [56] [57] [58] [59] .",

Also, in a previous study with different doses of H5 VLPs, 4 fold differences in dosage did not result in significant differences in lung viral titers although vaccinated groups showed lower lung viral titers compared to the mock control 28 . It was also demonstrated that protection against H5N1 virus was observed in the absence of serum HI activities in vaccinated mice 17 and that HI antibody levels were very low after a single dose of the H5N1 live attenuated virus vaccine 9 . Importantly, it is worth noting that a single dose of rBV-derived H5 VLPs conferred complete protection as observed in the present study whereas two doses were previously used with mammalian cell-produced influenza VLPs 34 . Therefore, in summary, proteomic information on influenza VLPs will be very helpful in elucidating the mechanisms by which VLPs are formed and released, as well as new insights on how VLPs induce protective immunity.",
