The possible nano zinc oxide was successfully synthesized by precipitation technique and then impregnated effectively over cellulose fibres through sodium alginate matrix. XRD analysis revealed the 'rod-like' shape alignment of zinc oxide with an interplanar d-spacing of 0.246 nm corresponding to the (1 0 1) planes of the hexagonal wurtzite structure. TEM analysis confirmed the nano dimension of the synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles. The presence of nano zinc oxide over cellulose fibres was evident from the SEM-EDS experiments. FTIR and TGA studies exhibited their effective bonding interaction. The tensile stress-strain curves data indicated the feasibility of the fabricated fibres for longer duration utility without any significant damage or breakage. The antibacterial studies against Escherichia coli revealed the excellent bacterial devastation property. Further, it was observed that when all the parameters remained constant, the variation of sodium alginate concentration showed impact in devastating the E. coli. In overall, the fabricated nano zinc oxide-sodium alginate cellulose fibres can be effectively utilized as antibacterial fibres for biomedical applications.",

The spread of infections like HIV, hepatitis viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), etc., through contamination, has created increased pressure for the protection of the personnel with antimicrobial clothing. Therefore, surgical fabrics should necessarily possess antimicrobial properties (Ambika & Sundrarajan, 2015; Mucha, Hoter, & Swerev, 2002; Vaideki, Jayakumar, Rajendran, & Thilagavathi, 2008) . The antimicrobial fabric when applied as wound dressings, it not only act as normal wound dressing but also provide hygienic atmosphere around the wound . Generally, the fibre used in the wound dressing functional clothing contains cellulose, a homopolymer of \u2424-d-glucopyranose units linked together by (1 \u2192 4)-glycosidic bonds (Raghavendra, Jayaramudu, Varaprasad, Sadiku, Ray, & Mohana Raju, 2013) .

Asymmetric and symmetric stretching of -COO group of alginate was observed at 1638 and 1408 cm \u22121 , respectively (Kulkarni, Sreedhar, Mutalik, Setty, & Sa, 2010) . In addition, sodium alginate showed a characteristic peak at 1022 cm \u22121 corresponding to C O stretching vibration of its polysaccharide structure. The peak at 862 cm \u22121 corresponds to Na O bond vibration (Samanta & Ray, 2014) . Pure cellulose fibre showed characteristic peaks at around 3364 cm \u22121 , 2924 cm \u22121 and at around 1311 cm \u22121 corresponding to -OH stretching frequency, CH 2 stretching vibration and C H bending mode respectively; characteristic bands at 1150 and 1015 cm \u22121 are assigned to the C-O-C from the glycosidic units or from \u2424-(1,4)-glycosidic bonds (Raghavendra, Jayaramudu, Varaprasad, Ramesh, & Raju, 2014) . The combination of the peaks corresponding to both sodium alginate and cellulose were observed in sodium alginate coated cellulose fibre. However, in case of cellulose-zinc oxide sodium alginate nanocomposite fibres, an additional peak distinctive for Zn-O-Zn vibrations was noticed at 533 cm \u22121 with slightly shift in the frequency of peaks corresponding to cellulose and sodium alginate (Ambika & Sundrarajan, 2015) . This evidently indicates the composite bonding nature of nano ZnO with cellulose fibre through sodium alginate matrix. The FTIR spectrum of zinc oxide (Fig. 2B) showed important peaks at 405 cm \u22121 and 697 cm \u22121 which indicate Zn-O stretching mode (Varaprasad, Ramam, Mohan Reddy, & Sadiku, 2014) . The peaks were observed at 1600-1640 and 3100-3600 cm \u22121 but not broad. This is due to the presence of traces of water after hydration by exposure of the ZnO in the open air (Morozov, Belousova, Ortega, Mafina, & Kuznetcov, 2015) .",

As shown in the TGA curves (Fig. 4) , an initial weight loss at a temperature below 100 \u2022 C was observed due to the loss of moisture present on the surface for all the samples. The primary thermogram of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles showed the higher degradation between 224 and 314 \u2022 C and a final residue of at 600 \u2022 C (Fig. 4A) whereas the sodium alginate coated cellulose fibre (SACF) and ZnO-SACNF fibres showed the higher degradation at between 289-443 \u2022 C and a final residue of at 600 \u2022 C (Fig. 4B) . The residual mass left over from the SACF (13%), ZnO-SACNF1 (15.25%) and ZnO-SACNF3 (17.75%), clearly indicates the existence of nano ZnO. Thermal studies led to the conclusion that with the increase in the percentage (%) of sodium alginate, the residual mass leftover also increases. This was due to rise in the number of nano ZnO over ZnO-SACNF with increase in sodium alginate concentration. The phenomenon is due to the overall rise in bonding interactions between 'nano ZnO sodium alginate matrix' and the polar groups of cellulose fibre that occurred with the increase in sodium alginate concentration. This raised the nano ZnO number effectively. In overall, TGA data demonstrates that ZnO-SACNF fibres are thermally more stable than the sodium alginate cellulose coated fibre. The tensile stress-strain curves data of sodium alginate coated cellulose fibres (SACFs) and ZnO-SACNF fibres were depicted in Table 1 . The data illustrates the mechanical properties such as: maximum stress (Fig. 5A ), Young's modulus (Fig. 5B ) and % elongation-at-break ( Fig. 5C ) of all the cellulose fibres. The results indicate that the ZnO-SACNF can be utilized for the longer duration of use without any significant damage or breakage.",

The antimicrobial efficacy of the ZnO-SACNF fibres was tested against Gram-negative bacterium E. coli. The inhibition zone for all the fibres was found to be in between 2.1 and 3.6 mm, shown in Fig. 6 . According to the Standard Antibacterial test \"SNV 195920-1992\", specimens showing more than 1 mm microbial zone inhibition can be considered as good antibacterial agents (Pollini, Russo, Licciulli, Sannino, & Maffezzoli, 2009; Raghavendra et al., 2013 Raghavendra et al., , 2014 . In the present investigation, the inhibition zones exhibited by cellulose fibre, ZnO-SACNF 1 , ZnO-SACNF 2 and ZnO-SACNF 3 against E. coli were 0.0, 2.1, 3.2, and 3.6 mm, respectively. Hence, the developed ZnO-SACNF from the current approach can be considered as good antibacterial agents and effective in killing the microbes. Further, it can be noticed that when pure cellulose fibre showed no inhibition zone, the fabricated fibres showed the inhibition zones of the order: ZnO-SACNF 1 < ZnO-SACNF 2 < ZnO-SACNF 3 . This order is quite expected and seemed to be in accordance with the amount of nano ZnO present in ZnO-SACNF fibres. It was concluded from the TGA analysis that the nano ZnO content proceeding increases with the increase of SA. Hence, the observed inhibition zones were also exhibited the similar trend and proved the results were in proportional with the nano ZnO content. The particular mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of ZnO is still a matter of dispute. Some researchers consider that it might be a consequence of the generation of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) on its surface (Trandafilovi\u0107 et al., 2012) .",

The possible zinc oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by precipitation method. The synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles possess rods-like shape alignment with an interplanar d-spacing of 0.246 nm corresponding to the (1 0 1) planes of hexagonal wurtzite structure acquiring an average particle size 25 \u00b1 5 nm. The successfully fabricated ZnO-SACNF showed excellent antibacterial activity against E. coli. Hence, from the viewpoint of biomedical applications, the fabricated ZnO-SACNF fibres may be utilized as antibacterial fabrics for wound dressing applications in the bacterial prone zone.",
