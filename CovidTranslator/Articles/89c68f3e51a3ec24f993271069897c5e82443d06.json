A 266-bp internal fragment from within ORF 2a was excised from a 2-kb Pst/Pst fragment of MHV-A59 cDNA clone 1033 (3) by digestion with Sac] and Noel and tailed with oligo(dC) as described previously (11) . This fragment was inserted into Smal-cleaved, oligo(dG)-tailed bacterial plasmid pGE374, between the \"out-of-frame\" truncated recA and lacZ genes . These recombinant plasmids were used to transform MC 1061 all as previously described (8, 11) . Clones in which the reading frame of lacZ was restored and hence presumably contained all three proteins fused in-frame were selected on the basis of ,3-galactosidase activity . This RecA/viral/LacZ tripartite fusion protein was identified from such a clone, purified on the basis of its insolubility after lysis of cells with Triton and sonication, and used to raise antiserum in rabbits all as described previously (11) . Both native and denatured proteins were used as immunogens to ensure a broad range of reactivity . This anti-ORF 2a serum was shown to react against ,B-galactosidase in a dot radioimmunoassay (8) and then reacted with proteins from infected cells . Figure 1 shows the detection of the ORF 2a product using this antiserum . Mouse fibroblast 17CI-1 cells were infected with MHV-A59 or mock-infected and cell lysates were derived at various times postinfection . A 30K protein was observed in infected cells following immunoprecipitation with anti-ORF 2a serum (Panel B) but not with serum directed against other viral proteins (for example MHV nucleocapsid protein, Panel C) or preimmune serum (Panel A) . This 30K protein is the correct size for the protein predicted from the sequence of ORF 2a . (There is also nucleocapsid protein observed in the products of immunoprecipitation with anti-ORE 2a serum as well as with preimmune serum (compare Panels A, B, and C) . This is due to nonspecific binding of nucleocapsid protein to the staphyloc-a b c d e f cal protein A used in the immunoprecipitations (l . Leibowitz, unpublished observation) .)",

Figure 2 shows the immunoprecipitation of proteins from cytosol and membrane fractions of 17CI-1 cells using antiserum directed against the 30K protein . This protein is found mostly in the cytosol and not in the membranes (Panel B) . This is consistent with the fact that sequence analysis of ORF 2a does not reveal any hydrophobic, potential membrane-spanning regions . As a control, samples were also reacted with a monoclonal antibody directed against E1, the coronavirus glycoprotein that is located primarily in intracellular membranes (Panel A) . Furthermore, the nucleocapsid protein which is present due to its nonspecific binding during immunoprecipitation (Panel B) is present only in the cytosol as expected . It is difficult to determine if there is any 30K protein in the nucleus as we were unable to recover nuclei completely free of membranes, cytoplasm, and unlysed cells .

MHV-A59-infected 17CI-1 cells were labeled with ['5S]methionine and -cysteine as in Fig . 1 and at 14 hr postinfection fractionated into nuclear, cytosol, and membrane fractions (15) . Samples from the membrane and cytosol fractions were immunoprecipitated with antiviral antibodies or control sera . (A) Lane a, membranes precipitated with an anti-reo virus a-1 protein monoclonal antibody (9B05) ; lane b, membranes immunoprecipitated with an anti-El (JA1 .8) monoclonal antibody; lane c, cytosol precipitated with anti-reovirus a-1 protein monoclonal antibody ; lane d, cylosol precipitated with anti-El monoclonal antibody . (B) Lane a, membranes precipitated with preimmune rabbit serum ; lane b, membranes precipitated with anti-ORF 2a serum ; lane c, cytosol precipitated with preimmune rabbit serum ; lane d, cytosol precipitated with anti-ORF 2a serum . D FIG . 3 . Indirect immunofluorescent staining of MHV-infected cells . L-2 cells were mock-infected or infected with MHV-JHM (1 PFU/cell) . At 9 hr postinfection cells were either fixed for 5 min with 2% buffered paraformaldehyde or left unfixed and then stained by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy using FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG or FITC goat anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody . (A) Infected fixed cells stained with anti-30K serum at a dilution of 1 :400 . (B) Infected fixed cells stained with anti-nucleocapsid monoclonal antibody . (C) Infected fixed cells stained with anti-E1 (12 .7) monoclonal antibody . (D) Infected fixed cells, stained with prelmmune serum at a dilution of 1 : 400 . (E) Mock-infected fixed cells stained with anti-30K serum at a dilution of 1 :400 . (F) Infected unfixed cells, stained with anti-30K serum at a dilution of 1 :50 .",
