Daily, MS F or more than 50 years, information and referral professionals across the U.S., working in United Ways and a variety of nonprof\u0131t organizations and government agencies, have responded to people with unmet health and human service needs by offering a compassionate ear, skillfully assessing callers' needs, and referring to myriad community-based services. In 2000, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recognized the value of information and referral (I&R) services by assigning the three-digit dialing code 2-1-1 for authorized use by information and referral providers. In their report and order, the FCC underscored the public need that exists for an easy-to-use, easy-to-remember N11 code to eff\u0131ciently bring community information and referral services to those who need them, providing a national safety network for persons to get access readily to assistance. 1 Today, more than 200 programs operating in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have been authorized by their respective state executive, legislature, or public utility commissions to use the 2-1-1 dialing code to accelerate access to the broad network of community, government, and faith-based services. United Way operates roughly 40% of the 2-1-1 program, and 60% are operated by a variety of nonprof\u0131t and municipal agencies. In 2011, more than 16,000,000 calls resulted in connections to programs and services.",

Resource database records include eligibility factors, application processes, days and hours of service delivery, and specif\u0131c service/site locations, as well as fees charged, where applicable. Additionally, 2-1-1 information specialists collect information on the callers' demographics, which may include ZIP-code, destination where services are needed, problems or needs expressed, gender, age, race/ethnicity, language spoken, and special situations such as veteran or active military status, homeless, pregnant, or recently unemployed, as well as follow-up contact information as appropriate. Although the data collected by different 2-1-1 systems can vary, these rich data paint a dramatic and unique picture of real-time needs and a community's health.",

Community-based data reviewed in the aftermath of Katrina show how migration patterns affected the health and human service needs of host communities that welcomed the evacuees. Surveillance data based on calls inquiring about the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Toronto and H1N1 across the U.S. in 2009 -2010 led to focused health messaging. In fact, the economic recession that began in 2008 was forecast in the reviews of 2007 data. That year, 2-1-1 systems in United Way for Southeast Michigan and Greater Cleveland Ohio began to notice that call trends for utility assistance continued to rise. But more importantly, a signif\u0131cant number of calls for low-cost housing search assistance, foreclosure counseling, and bankruptcy were on the rise as well. The surveillance provided by these 2-1-1 systems led to conversations with county and state coalitions. The looming crisis was identif\u0131ed and prevention strategies were launched. The early intervention by the Cuyahoga County coalition reported saving 600 families from housing foreclosures. Thus, future surveillance partnerships and activities of 2-1-1 systems may lead to more eff\u0131cient and outcome-oriented prevention strategies and allocation of resources.",

The articles 2-18 demonstrate inspiring possibilities for ways in which 2-1-1 systems and their partners can cooperate and collaborate to influence vulnerable populations by encouraging healthy behaviors, by raising awareness of preventive services, and by breaking down barriers that prevent access. In addition, 2-1-1 data and research results have the potential to greatly enhance the national dialogue about how we achieve healthier and more resilient communities. Although these projects inspire, they also raise questions for 2-1-1 practitioners and researchers alike.",

The 2-1-1 systems and researchers will need to assess carefully the value of the add-on assessment questions to ensure the appropriateness of communications with the caller as we work together to achieve positive health outcomes.

This means that 2-1-1 providers will need to increase their capacity to continue to provide quality services for all callers, even as program staff work to integrate research initiatives into their operations. Researchers will need to conduct advanced planning with 2-1-1 staff to include the cost of increased staff\u0131ng capacity into project budgets. For example, typical calls today average 5-6 minutes. Additional call time needs to be accounted for as additional assessment questions are built into a research script.",

To be full partners, the 2-1-1 network will need to standardize on a minimal set of data elements with standard def\u0131nitions to facilitate comparative analyses. In addition, 2-1-1 systems will need to agree to a consistency of practice in how and what data are collected as well as for what purposes. Moreover, they will need a means to aggregate and share data across geographic regions.",
