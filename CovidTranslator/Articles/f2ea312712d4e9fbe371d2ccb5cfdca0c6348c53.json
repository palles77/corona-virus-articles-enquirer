The antiviral drugs were extracted from the homogenized poultry muscle sample using methanol. The extract was purified using tandem solid-phase extraction combining a cation exchange cartridge and a phenylboronic acid cartridge. To prevent excessive matrix effects, the analytes were separated from the matrix constituents using a column-switch liquid chromatography system combining a reversed-phase and a Hypercarb analytical column. Detection was carried out using tandem mass spectrometry. The method was fully validated according to 2002/657/EC [1] and proved to be adequate for quantification and confirmation of zanamivir and ribavirin at 10 \u03bcg kg \u22121 , oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine at levels below 1.0 \u03bcg kg \u22121 and for qualitative confirmatory analysis of arbidol at levels below 1 \u03bcg kg \u22121 .",

Recent outbreaks of avian influenza (H5N1) have had a huge economic effect in the poultry breeding sector [2, 3] but besides the economic effect, human health is at stake because avian influenza can also infect mammals including humans [4, 5] . The increasing incidence of resistance to antiviral drugs is a major concern to public health. Because strains tend to become more aggressive, adequate therapeutic strategies are needed [6] .",

However, concerns arose about the increasing incidence of resistance to antiviral drugs [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Several causes have been suggested including the inappropriate use of antiviral drugs in the treatment of humans during the outbreaks of avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [13, 14] . Furthermore, it has been shown that oseltamivir carboxylate ( Fig. 1) is not removed or degraded in normal sewage water treatment and thus enters the environment [15] . Waterfowl are then in a position to ingest the active oseltamivir carboxylate. This could drive the selection of resistant avian influenza A strains in the gut. Especially in countries (e.g. Southeast Asia) where waterfowl and humans come in close contact, this could lead to the spread of other strains incorporating the resistance genes and change of host [16, 17] . Finally, amantadine, oseltamivir and arbidol ( Fig. 1 ) are allegedly being administered to poultry and other livestock in China, Southeast Asia and Russia [7, 18, 19] . To prevent excessive use of antiviral drugs the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibited the non-consistent use of two types of antiviral drugs in chickens, turkeys and ducks: the amantadines, including amantadine and rimantadine, and the neuramidase inhibitors, including zanamivir and oseltamivir ( Fig. 1 ) [20] .",

Recently, Chan et al. [39] reported a multi-compound method for the analysis of antiviral drugs in poultry muscle using zwitterionic hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (zic-HILIC) in combination with mass spectrometric detection. However, this method is suitable for screening purposes only and it is limited to the analysis of basic and amphoteric antiviral drugs.",

The matrix effect As an alternative to the column-switch set-up, different single analytical columns were tested. zic-HILIC (Sequant, Ume\u00e5, Sweden) was tested in combination with gradient elution using ammonium formate in water and ACN or MeOH as the mobile phase, at a pH ranging from 3 to 10. Reversed-phase (RP) C 18 was tested in combination with gradient elution using water and ACN or MeOH as the mobile phase, at a pH ranging from 3 to 11. Hypercarb was tested in combination with gradient elution using water and ACN, MeOH or tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase. For each chromatographic condition, the matrix effects were evaluated on the basis of spiked poultry muscle samples using only a methanolic extraction in combination with evaporation of the extraction solvent and redissolution in a suitable solvent. We aimed for a chromatographic system that results in sufficient retention for all compounds and adequate separation of the antiviral drugs from the matrix constituents to minimize matrix effects. SPE using strong cation exchange and PBA were tested for sample clean-up. A 50 \u03bcg kg \u22121 spiked methanolic sample extract was acidified and applied onto a Strata-X C cartridge. The breakthrough during application and washing were collected separately. These and the eluent were analysed using the LC-MS/MS system.

Thompson [41] , however, demonstrated that the Horwitz equation is not applicable to the lower concentration range (<120 \u03bcg kg \u22121 ) and suggested a complementary model. On the basis of this model the RSD RL and RSD r are acceptable if they are below 22% and 14.7%, respectively. The latter, more stringent criteria were adopted for this validation study. It is stated that because different poultry muscle samples were used within 1 day, the repeatability is not the pure repeatability as stated in 2002/657/EC [1] .

For arbidol, inadequate linearity, trueness, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility are observed. On two validation days, the calibration lines are adequate, but on 1 day the linearity is insufficient due to two deviating calibration points. The poor trueness, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility of arbidol are caused by 10 out of 63 spiked samples showing a quantitative result that is 1.5-3.5 times higher than expected. This is likely to be caused by a difference in matrix interference, which plays a major role for arbidol Fig. 6 SRM chromatograms of (a) blank poultry muscle sample spiked with zanamivir and ribavirin at 10 \u03bcg kg \u22121 including the internal standards and (b) blank poultry muscle sample spiked with the internal standards only (Fig. 5a) .

The acidic methanol should be at pH\u22642 to retain zanamivir on the Strata-X C material and the alkaline MeOH should be at least pH 12 for the elution of amantadine and rimantadine. Incorrect pH results in a severe decrease of the recovery. Secondly, it was found critical to centrifuge the basified breakthrough of the Strata-X C cartridge before applying it onto the PBA cartridge to prevent clogging. For ruggedness testing, three slight deviations to the procedure that might occur in practice were specifically tested: (1) extraction for 30 min instead of 15, (2) dry the PBA cartridges by applying vacuum for 1 min after applying the extract and after washing the cartridge and (3) evaporation of the solvent at 55\u00b0C instead of 50\u00b0C. The duplicates analysed by incorporating these deviations in the method showed good trueness and acceptable duplicates, indicating that the tested processes are robust.",

These levels are in good agreement with the indicated amantadine concentration, being approximately 4 \u03bcg kg \u22121 for the poultry muscle and 8-25 \u03bcg kg \u22121 for the turkey muscle. From this it is concluded that the developed method is applicable to real muscle samples.",

            "text": "A method using a tandem SPE sample preparation clean-up combined with column-switch LC-MS/MS was developed for the analysis of seven antiviral drugs in poultry muscle, ranging from very polar to reasonably non-polar drugs, and including basic, amphoteric and neutral compounds. The removal of matrix interferences was critical for the detection and quantification of zanamivir and ribavirin in particular. Because neither compound was sufficiently retained by using reversed-phase chromatography, a column-switch LC system combining a reversed-phase and a Hypercarb column was developed. This system showed improved separation power and is relatively easy to set-up, which is of major importance in a routine situation. Furthermore, a tandem SPE procedure proved to be mandatory for additional removal of matrix constituents. The method was fully validated according to 2002/657/EC [1] at concentrations of 5, 10 and 15 \u03bcg kg \u22121 . Good linearity, trueness, repeatability and within-lab reproducibility were obtained for zanamivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine. For arbidol these paramaters did not comply with the established criteria because the method resulted in a severe overestimation of the concentration for 16% of the spiked samples. The selectivity and robustness proved to be sufficient to apply the presented method in a routine situation enabling parallel analysis of at least 48 samples within 1 day. It is concluded that the presented method is suitable for the quantitative confirmatory analysis of zanamivir and ribavirin at levels as low as 10 \u03bcg kg \u22121 and for oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg kg \u22121 . Furthermore, the presented method is suitable for the qualitative confirmatory analysis of arbidol at a concentration of 1 \u03bcg kg \u22121 .",

'Column1' is a Waters Symmetry C 18 (3.0\u00d7150 mm, 5 \u03bcm) analytical column and 'column 2' is a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham MA, USA) Hypercarb (3.0\u00d7100 mm, 5 \u03bcm) analytical column.From the initial time 'LC 1' runs a gradient (solvent A, 50 mM FA in water; solvent B, 50 mM FA in ACN): 0-6.0 min, linear increase from 0% to 5% B; 6.0-14.0 min, linear increase to 100% B; 14.0-14.5 min, linear decrease to 0% B; 14.5-20.0 min, equilibration at 0% B, operating at a flow of 0.4 mL min \u22121 . 'LC 2' runs a gradient using the same solvents: 0-6.0 min, 5% B; 6.0-10.0 min, linear increase to 100% B; 10.0-11.0 min, 100% B; 11.0 -12.0 min, linear decrease to 0% B; 12.0-20.0 min, equillibration at 0% B, operating at a flow of 0.4 mL min \u22121 . The injection volume (injected at 'LC 1') is 50 \u03bcL.",
