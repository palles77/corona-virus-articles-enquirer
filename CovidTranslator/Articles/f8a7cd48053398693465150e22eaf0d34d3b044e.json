Given the inevitable emotions involved on the part of the owner that doesn't have a large herd, it is important to maintain a clear head when evaluating these cases and to be thorough while acting promptly to deal with life-threatening conditions. As detailed elsewhere in this publication, close monitoring of neonates is advisable such that any deviation from normality can be detected early and the potentially fatal consequences of neonatal illness avoided. Neonatal body systems are not as resilient as those of adult animals and relatively minor events may have quite dramatic adverse effects on the cria. They are also much more vulnerable to exposure to pathogens. Thus, it is not uncommon to be presented with a cria that appears to be completely unresponsive and may have major biochemical or hematological derangements. However, crias do seem to be remarkably responsive to intensive care in contrast to foals, and those that respond well in the first 24 hours of treatment will often proceed to make a full recovery. The exceptions are those crias having congenital defects that will not be amenable to treatment, such as choanal atresia, or major cardiac abnormalities; it is especially important to evaluate crias fully on presentation for any defects that may potentially make costly treatment failure inevitable and cause further distress to the cria, its dam, and the owner.",

Often there will be a combination of these factors. Crias born following a difficult birthing or C-section delivery are also more susceptible to development of hypoglycemia and FPT caused by fetal and maternal exhaustion and delayed nursing. They may also have cerebral hypoxia as a result of prolonged parturition and need additional attention in ensuring adequate intake of nutrition for the first few days of life.",

            "text": "By the time most crias present for evaluation, they are often going to require intravenous fluid therapy of some sort. Therefore, it is reasonable to place an IV catheter early in the evaluation so that emergency treatment can be initiated while the examination is under way. Furthermore, blood samples can be collected from the catheter immediately after sterile placement for hematology, biochemistry, and culture, thereby reducing the number of venipuncture sites. Hematoma formation is even more common in crias than in adults and each venipuncture increases the chance of introducing pathogenic bacteria into the bloodstream of the neonate. Rapid evaluation of glucose on a handheld glucometer and packed cell volume (PCV) and total protein assessment can give useful early clues for therapy. If an in-house hematology analyzer is not available, then a fresh blood smear should be examined to guide diagnosis and antibiotic choice. Arterial or venous blood-gas analysis is also ideal. There are some good quality handheld blood-gas analyzers available now, but their accuracy in camelids is so far untested. They may prove to be an excellent tool for practitioners working with camelids in the field because of the rapidity with which results are available. This may greatly enhance diagnostic ability and aid in decision making on the farm.",

            "text": "For crias, an 18-guage, 2-inch Angiocath catheter is ideally placed into the jugular vein for up to 5 days and is easy to place. For crias that may require a catheter for longer periods, then a 16-guage, polyurethane over-the-wire catheter (MILA International, KY) would be more appropriate because they are less thrombogenic and they become dislodged less frequently. The latter are a little more technically demanding to place and require strict attention to sterility during placement. The jugular vein in crias is easier to catheterize than those of adults because the overlying skin is not as thick and the vein can be readily visualized once the skin has been clipped. Peripheral veins, such as the cephalic vein, are hard to visualize in crias and are difficult to maintain because they are highly positional. They are also not suitable for plasma administration. It is important that the handler has proper control of the cria to minimize vascular trauma during placement. Local anesthetic infiltration of the site of venipuncture greatly enhances catheter placement (0.2-0.3 mL lidocaine). The author prefers the cria to be positioned in sternal recumbency with the head held so that the neck is straight and immobilized; others prefer the cria to be positioned in lateral recumbency. The drawings in Fig. 1 illustrate the author's preferred technique. In crias with hypovolemia, the blood pressure may be so poor that it is not able to displace a column of heparinized saline within the catheter. Therefore, in crias it may be advisable to flush the catheter and then let the flush drain through prior to placement. If venous access is not possible because of hypovolemia, intraosseous infusion may be achieved by placement of an 18-guage spinal needle into the proximal femur. Fluids may be administered just as easily by this route and will soon restore blood pressure so that an intravenous catheter may be placed.",

Oxygen can be administered by way of a face mask or nasal insufflation tubes; those used for humans work well for crias and they can be secured around the back of the head. They are generally better tolerated than face masks and free up the operator to do other tasks as it is not necessary for them to be constantly present holding a mask in place. If these are not available, a small-diameter flexible catheter can be inserted up one nostril to the level of the medial canthus and secured in position for oxygen supplementation. If intubation is required for a cria that is not breathing by itself, an endotracheal tube (size 4-6) can be placed with the aid of a long-bladed laryngoscope and a dog urinary catheter can be used as a stylet to guide placement.",

            "text": "Once the IV catheter has been placed, the blood-glucose concentration should be checked on a handheld glucometer and any hypoglycemia should be addressed. If hypoglycemia is severe, it is recommended to give a slow infusion of about 50 mL of dextrose-containing fluid (ideally about 10% dextrose) over about 5 to 10 minutes. This provides a safe volume of resuscitation fluid and this can be repeated 20 to 30 minutes later if required. Large volumes of fluid can easily induce pulmonary edema in crias. Boluses of hypertonic dextrose solutions (eg, 50% dextrose) may worsen any preexisting CNS problems and should generally be avoided. 1 Further fluid-therapy decisions can be made once the results of biochemistry are available. In general, maintenance fluid-therapy requirements are about 50% higher than those of adults. The author uses a guide of 1.5 mL/lb/hr for maintenance in crias (or 3.3 mL/kg/hr) and this can be administered by continuous rate infusion using an infusion pump. When crias are more active and able to get up and nurse for themselves, bolus administration of fluids every 2 to 4 hours can be easier to manage since the cria does not need to be separated from its dam. When administering glucose or dextrose to sick crias, it is important to monitor blood-glucose concentrations serially as crias do appear to be prone to a hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome (discussed elsewhere in the issue). 2 For this reason, checking blood-glucose concentration is warranted from the perspective of assessing and managing hyperglycemic crias.",

            "text": "A plasma transfusion may be warranted in certain situations. In an emergency situation with a neonate less than 7 days of age, provided congenital abnormalities have Neonatal Diseases in Llamas and Alpacas been ruled out, plasma is almost certainly going to be required since the cria is likely to have some degree of FPT, regardless of the underlying cause. As detailed elsewhere in this issue, there are several ways to assess adequacy of passive transfer. Since the most accurate radial immunodiffusion (RID) test takes 24 hours to run, a more immediate, but crude, assessment can be made using a refractometer reading of total solids as long as the clinician is aware of the limitations of this method. If the refractometer reading is really low (<4.5 g/dL), this is consistent with FPT; if the cria is dehydrated, the actual reading would be even lower. Above this it may be difficult to be sure, so protein and globulin concentration determination on biochemistry results may be more useful. However, Dolente and colleagues 3 found that there was no significant difference between the total protein concentrations in septic crias with positive blood cultures regardless of whether the cria was shown to have FPT or not. The authors suggested that there may be many factors relating to sepsis that make total-protein assessment an unreliable indicator of IgG concentration.",

Plasma is much more effective than crystalloid fluids at expanding volume in very ill neonates, since these crias often have increased endothelial permeability caused by inflammatory changes as a result of sepsis and endotoxemia. Clinically, the observed response during a plasma transfusion can be quite rewarding. The safest method of plasma administration is intravenously using an administration set with an in-line filter that filters out any protein clots. The author typically gives 1 mg/kg of flunixin meglumine intravenously as a premedication about 5 to 15 minutes before commencing the infusion. Very rarely, anaphylactic reactions may occur, therefore it is important to start the transfusion slowly in order to minimize the potential effects should anaphylaxis occur. Normally, it is advisable to give the transfusion over 30 to 40 minutes while monitoring the heart for excessive tachycardia or rhythm The cria is placed cushed on a table with the handler drawing the cria to the edge of the table against him/herself for added control. The right hand is placed over the shoulders to prevent the cria from jumping up and the left hand cradles the cria's jaw ensuring that the cria can breathe easily. It helps to hold the cria's head against the chest to give added control. It is important that the cria's neck is in a straight line with its body and that the head is not pulled across to one side, which is less comfortable for the cria and makes it harder for catheter placement. (B) Local anesthetic placement. Following clipping of a rectangle of hair from over the jugular vein on the right side of the neck, the site is prepared aseptically. A subcutaneous bleb of local anesthetic (about 0.2-0.3 mL lidocaine in a cria) is placed over the jugular vein using a 25 g needle. (C, D) Catheter placement. The catheter is placed through the site of local anesthetic infiltration directly into the jugular vein. Once the catheter is in the vein, advance it just slightly so that it is properly seated in the vein. For a right-handed person, the stylet is held between thumb and finger using the right hand and the catheter is advanced over the stylet into the vein using the left finger and thumb placed on the hub of the catheter. It helps to anchor the right hand fingers against the cria's neck in order to help prevent the skin from rucking up as you slide the catheter into the vein. Blood can be collected at this point for diagnostics. (E, F) Attach extension tubing and secure in place. Extension tubing containing heparinized-flush solution is attached to the hub of the catheter. Use the shorter extension sets that have a clamp or valve. It is not necessary to suture the catheter in place; an elasticon bandage wrapped first behind the catheter and over the hub in order to secure it in place works well. Overthe-wire catheters should be sutured. Place a sterile injection port on the end of the extension tubing; this should be changed every 24 hours. = Neonatal Diseases in Llamas and Alpacas disturbances and respiratory rate, but larger volumes (40 mL/kg) should be given over an hour. Anecdotally, the author has known 20 mL/kg to be given over 5-10 minutes due to operating within a veterinary teaching hospital without adverse consequences although this rapid an infusion is not recommended! Intraperitoneal transfusion (high right flank) has been done regularly by practitioners, but this approach is not recommended and has the following disadvantages: if given rapidly (5-10 minutes) it results in abdominal pain caused by the large volume given relative to peritoneal cavity space; peritonitis may result if adequate aseptic technique is not used or nonsterile plasma is given; adhesions may result from fibrin deposition and peritonitis and this may result in colic up to 2 years later; inadvertent puncture of abdominal organs may occur resulting in hemorrhage or punctured bowel. Furthermore, intraperitoneal transfusions are contraindicated if the cria is already showing signs of sepsis and these may be as vague as a failure to gain weight (or weight loss), or failure to nurse.",

            "text": "Newborns are especially susceptible to hypothermia and hypoglycemia.These conditions will often occur together as hypothermic neonates will not stand up to nurse resulting in hypoglycemia. At birth, neonates are subjected to a rapid drop in external temperature and are highly dependent upon nonshivering thermogenesis (NST) to create heat. 4 This process takes place in the mitochondria of brown-adipose tissue and results in an uncoupling of fatty acid oxidation such that heat energy is produced instead of ATP. It is highly dependent on adequate oxygenation, therefore, hypoxemic neonates are more susceptible to the development of hypothermia. Additionally, premature neonates are likely to have inadequate reserves of brown-adipose tissue which develops in the fetus under the influence of NST inhibitors, leaving them at increased risk of hypothermia at birth. Shivering may provide an additional source of heat but the likely impact is small in neonates becase of their small size and immature musculature. The presence of brown-adipose tissue has not been specifically documented in camelids to date, so it is uncertain to what extent NST plays a role in averting hypothermia in crias. Thyroid hormones are thought to play a role in enhancing thermogenesis in the newborn: neonatal llama crias have been shown to have very high thyroxine concentrations at birth, which decreased gradually over the first 90 days of life. 5 Hypothermic neonates will be depressed and lethargic, will have reduced reflexes and poor ventilation. This, together with poor cardiac function, results in hypoxia acidemia and cardiac dysrhythmias. 6 Hypothermic neonates are susceptible to FPT because they will have a reduced amount of time in which to acquire colostral immunity before gut closure commences.",

Presenting complaints in crias with sepsis include lethargy, depression, failure to nurse or even a failure to gain weight or a loss of weight over a 24-hour period. As previously mentioned, hypothermia, tachycardia, and tachypnea are relatively common clinical findings. Additionally, there may be evidence of dehydration and injected mucous membranes. From personal experience, crias presenting with a history of failure to gain weight or a loss of weight over the preceding 24 hours may have normal physical examination findings, but hematology performed at this time may reveal a significant leukocytosis or leukopenia with a left shift supportive of the onset of sepsis. Blood work may also reveal findings suggestive of FPT, such as hypoproteinemia and hypoglobulinemia. Treatment at this stage may often avert a crisis presentation 12 to 24 hours later and supports the recommendation of being proactive in terms of performing diagnostics in neonatal camelids. Crias will deteriorate rapidly if early signs of sepsis are not recognized and treated. Additional laboratory findings later on in sepsis may include hypo-or hyperglycemia, azotemia as a result of dehydration or kidney failure, and electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities.

Plasma transfusions are usually required to treat any underlying FPT, but plasma is also very effective at expanding volume in septic crias as they will often have increased endothelial permeability caused by inflammatory changes as a result of sepsis and endotoxemia. Crias can develop hyperglycemia, hypernatremia, and hyperosmolarity in response to dehydration and stress. 2 Sepsis can exacerbate the syndrome. Camelids are prone to hyperglycemia as a result of stress as they are known to exhibit poor pancreatic responses resulting in slower glucose clearance than other species. 10 Crias appear to be able to clear glucose more rapidly because of stronger insulin responses and they are also better able to respond to exogenous insulin, but this may not be true in sick crias. 11 Hypernatremia results from loss of water as a result of glucose diuresis. Even on isotonic fluids, such as lactated Ringer's solution, crias have a tendency to become hypernatremic, therefore the author prefers to use fluids with lower sodium concentrations (eg 0.45% sodium chloride with 2.5% dextrose as long as there is no preexisting hyperglycemia). It is important to monitor glucose concentrations and electrolytes when managing sick crias. Insulin therapy (at a dose of 0.2 IU/kg SQ 11 ) is indicated in hyperglycemic crias to prevent ongoing glucose diuresis, and supplementation of fluids with potassium chloride is often required to prevent or treat hypokalemia.",

Bacterial culture did not yield any Clostridium sp in these cases; assays for clostridial toxins were not performed. Diagnostic tests for viral pathogens or parasites were not done.",

Coronavirus was the most common pathogen causing diarrhea in unweaned crias in one recent study. 22 It was identified by electron microscopy in 42% of cases and affected 64% of herds studied with an age distribution from 10 to 150 days at the time of diagnosis. In the same study, this was the only pathogen involved in outbreaks that also affected adults. Coronavirus also was found to cause diarrhea at any time of year in contrast to coccidiosis, in which case outbreaks coincided with wetter times of year (Fall and Spring). In contrast, rotavirus was found in only 2% of cases. Parre\u00f1 o and colleagues investigated the presence of rotavirus and coronavirus in two farms of captured guanacos in Patagonia (Argentina). 23 Both farms suffered severe diarrhea outbreaks affecting 100% of the herds, and fatal in 83% of cases. Animals were aged between 1 day and 4 months at time of capture, kept in small yards, and raised on powdered cow's milk. In all cases disease was acute in onset and the stool was dark-green. Dehydration occurred and death followed within 2 to 6 days. Affected animals were 7 to 40 days old. Rotavirus was detected in the feces from two neonates (aged 2 and 7 days). Molecular characterization of rotavirus isolates from newborn guanacos in Argentina were shown to be closely related to other bovine rotavirus strains from other parts of the world. 24 Puntel and colleagues conducted a serological survey among 390 llamas in Argentina testing for antibodies to a variety of viruses including bovine rotavirus. 25 They found antibody prevalence for rotavirus of 88% with positive animals from all nine of the farms tested. The authors surmised that these findings suggest a high susceptibility of llamas to bovine rotavirus. No clinical cases of diarrhea were reported on the farms of study. Mattson reported detection of coronavirus by electron microscopy in two young llamas with diarrhea. 26 One of these cases was aged 12 days and the other 9 months.",

Cryptosporidium oocysts are extremely resistant to decay in the environment and to most disinfectants. As few as 10 oocysts can induce disease in susceptible individuals, while clinically affected calves can shed massive numbers of oocysts during infections forming a significant source of infection for other animals. 27 Additionally, asymptomatic adult cattle are thought to be a major source of environmental contamination. The exact mechanism by which Cryptosporidium attaches and invades enterocytes is poorly understood at the present time. However, it is known that following attachment, Cryptosporidium forms a parasitophorous vacuole within the host cell (intracellular but extracytoplasmic) bounded by a parasitophorous vacuolar membrane derived from the host-cell membrane. This protects the organism from the hostile environment of the gut lumen and the host cell's defenses. An additional feeder organelle membrane in Cryptosporidium, as opposed to other coccidian parasites, is thought to be primarily responsible for nutrient uptake from the host cell. Inclusion of Cryptosporidium within enterocytes reduces gastrointestinal absorption in affected individuals caused by loss of epithelium, villous atrophy, and crypt hyperplasia leading to dehydration and electrolyte imbalance (malabsorptive diarrhea). Maldigestion also occurs as a result of the loss of membrane-bound digestive enzymes, such that weight loss and emaciation in neonates is typical. Autoinfection can occur. The author has diagnosed renal failure in multiple crias with cryptosporidiosis. The mechanism of kidney damage is presumed to be prolonged states of subclinical dehydration leading to reduced renal perfusion and tubular necrosis.",

Cebra and colleagues isolated Eimeria spp out of 13% of 45 unweaned llama or alpaca crias with diarrhea; these six crias were between 21 and 60 days old. 22 Adults are more resistant to clinical disease because of mature immune systems and prior exposure. Coccidiosis is typically associated with overcrowding and poor hygiene. The pathogenesis and severity of the clinical signs observed may be associated with the number of coccidia ingested. Reinfections from a contaminated environment can cause an excessive coccidia burden that may be fatal. 36 Coccidia undergo sexual and asexual reproduction stages within the intestinal epithelia to produce oocysts and these cause direct damage to the epithelial mucosa of the small intestine resulting in enteritis and diarrhea. Tenesmus may be observed. Diarrhea may be hemorrhagic and contain shreds of sloughed mucosa. As a result, nutrient malabsorption and subsequent poor growth ensues. Cheney and Allen report that since the lesions are primarily in the small intestine, fresh blood is rarely seen in affected llamas. 37 Coccidiosis in camelids is caused by several different species belonging to the genus Eimeria. Coccidia tend to be highly species-specific. Six species have been identified that affect South American Camelids and these include: Eimeria lamae, E. alpacae, E. macusaniensis, E. punoensis, E. peruviana and E ivitaensis. 36, [38] [39] [40] [41] All except the latter of these have been detected in fecal samples from camelids in the United States. 36 A distinguishing feature of the E. macusaniensis oocyst is that it is much larger than the other four species, measuring 81 to 107 mm in length, and has a very thick wall. 39 In contrast, the other main four species measure 17 to 40 mm in length and have a thin-walled oocyst. 38 The life cycle is not well-established for coccidia specific to South American Camelids. However, Foreyt lists prepatent periods for four out of the five species that affect South American Camelids. 42 These vary from as short as 10 days for E. punoensis to 33 to 34 days for E. macusaniensis. The prepatent periods for E. alpacae and E. punoensis were established from experimental data using fecal samples from four llamas. 43 The authors have seen clinical coccidiosis in alpacas as early as age 21 days. Such an early appearance of clinical disease suggests that neonates exposed to contaminated environments can become infected in the first few days of life.",

Histopathologically, throughout the mucosa there were large numbers of sexual and asexual stages of a coccidian that was thought to be E. macusaniensis. These were causing marked disruption of the epithelial crypt glands.

Since outbreaks of coccidiosis are common in the wetter months, prophylactic drug regimes should be used during these times of year. Consideration should be given to application of preventative measures before and during stressful events, such as weaning, shearing, or herd movements. Amprolium may be used prophylactically and is added to water at 5 mg/kg body weight daily over a 21-day period. Correct dosage of amprolium is important since it is a thiamine analogue and overdosing may produce clinical polioencephalomalacia. Alternatively, decoquinate may be used more safely when added to feed at 0.5 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Ionophore antibiotics, such as monensin or salinomycin should not be used to prevent coccidiosis in camelids, since they are susceptible to toxicity of these drugs.",
