A global outbreak of PED began in 2013, and the disease has been reported in many countries around world. In Japan, the first case of PED to occur in Japan in 7 years was reported in October 2013 and PED then spread across the country. During the acute phase of a PED outbreak, the mortality rate of infected piglets is very high and may reach 100%. Reduction and/or loss of suckling stimulation from piglets during lactation strongly influence sow ovarian follicular development, which is associated with changes in reproductive hormone secretion (Langendijk et al. 2007 ). There has been only one published report investigating the relationship between PED and reproductive performance (Olanratmanee et al. 2010) , and to our knowledge there have been no other investigations into the influence of piglet loss due to PED on the ovaries of the sow at weaning and her subsequent reproductive performance.",

(2013) and Carvajal et al. (2015) , although those reports were based on F 1 crossbred pigs. After the initial month of the PED outbreak, preweaning mortality returned to levels not significantly higher than before the outbreak. This result suggests that the response to the PED outbreak, including herd immunization, intensive cleaning, and disinfection, and early weaning programs effectively controlled the outbreak so that during the next few months the sows and their litters experienced low effects of PED. In contrast, monthly differences in farrowing rates before and after the PED outbreak were significant in January, February, and March. These results indicate that the PED outbreak negatively influenced sow fertility, an effect likely to last for some time. Thus, it is necessary to monitor the sows that were infected with PED around the time of weaning and mating to avoid an increase in nonproductive days.",

In addition, during January 2014, the month that the PED outbreak started, the percentages of sows that had ovulated (15%) or had mature follicles on their ovaries (10%) at weaning were both high compared to during the other months studied. Stimulation from suckling piglets suppresses follicular development, onset of estrus, and ovulation during lactation (Quesnel and Prunier 1995) . Our results suggest that a Means within year and month without a common letter (a-b) are significantly different (P < 0.05) Values within a column without a common letter (a-c) were significantly different (P < 0.05) decrease in and/or lack of stimulation from suckling piglets, due the PED infection, increased the occurrence of large mature follicles and preweaning ovulation. In general, follicular development and maturation is associated with gonadotrophin (LH and FSH) stimulation. Estradiol-17\u03b2 is secreted from mature follicles greater than 6 mm in diameter; follicles of this size are close to ovulation (Noguchi et al. 2010 ). In addition, low suckling stimulation may result in lactational estrus and extend the weaning-to-first mating interval; indeed, this period was longer in sows exposed to PED than in sows not exposed to PED. Normally, sows do not experience lactational ovulation because during lactation, the peripheral concentration and pulsatility of LH are suppressed due to suckling-induced inhibition of the GnRH-pulse generator (De Rensis et al. 1993) and also to the negative energy balance of the sow during lactation (van den Brand et al. 2000) , both of which inhibit follicle growth and ovulation. However, when suckling intensity is reduced, follicle growth and ovulation can occur during lactation (Soede et al. 2011 ).",
