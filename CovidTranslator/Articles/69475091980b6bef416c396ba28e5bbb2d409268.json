While most cases have involved people from or visiting Saudi Arabia, there is an ongoing outbreak in the Republic of Korea. 5 Between 2003 and 2008 it was predicted that a new form of influenza might emerge to affect humans. 6 Birds in South East Asia were expected to be the source. There are many strains of influenza viruses and many host species. Birds, dogs, horses, pigs, humans and many other species of mammals can be affected by influenza A viruses. 7 In 2009 when a new influenza pandemic did occur it started through contact with pigs in Mexico. The virus was H1N1, similar to the strain involved in the 1918 'Spanish' influenza pandemic which killed about 50 million people and to the 1977/78 'Russian' flu virus. 8 Ebola has been known about since 1976. 9 The outbreak in West Africa which commenced in December 2013 has led to cases being managed",

Aerosol spray generation in the dental surgery has the potential to spread such infections to staff or other patients. Although the diseases may differ, some common approaches can reduce the risk of transmission.

[12] [13] [14] [15] The emerging infection which hit the news in January 2016 is Zika virus. This virus is carried by mosquito species such as Aedes aegypti, which also carries yellow fever and dengue viruses. Zika virus was first discovered in Uganda in 1947 and since has slowly spread through South Asia and Pacific islands to reach Brazil. 16 Currently there are concerns about possible links with microcephaly. A known rare complication of Zika infection is Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Currently, Zika infection risk in the UK would be limited to imported cases of people infected abroad, reflecting the locations where mosquitoes are carrying Zika virus. Aedes aegypti is currently restricted to presence in Madeira, Georgia and South Russia, although it was recently found for the first time in the Netherlands. 17 In none of these areas has Zika virus been reported to date. 18 The emerging infections noted above are those which have hit the UK media. There are many other emerging infections. TB is OPINION re-emerging in some areas, particularly London where it accounts for 40% of all UK cases. 19",

            "text": "Coronaviruses and influenza viruses are spread via droplets, aerosols, or through direct contact with respiratory secretions of someone with the infection. The virus particles can survive within small droplets in the air for several hours. 20 Thus when influenza is circulating there is a potential higher risk of transmission within dental practices because of the aerosol sprays generated by drills and ultrasonic scalers. For influenza it is thought that this risk of transmission is restricted to the room where dental care is given, provided the door to the room is closed. 21, 22 In the early phase of response to H1N1, when there were concerns that this form of influenza caused high mortality, the American guidance recommended negative pressure air handling and full fit-tested protective equipment. 23 In recent years a large proportion of the emerging infections have been viral infections of the respiratory tract, spread through droplets and aerosols. These have the potential to pass from person to person, and even country to country, very quickly. Dental practice, involving both close contact to the airway and generation of aerosol sprays, presents a high-risk environment to catch or pass on these infections. 24 However this risk can be reduced by use of masks and gloves, pre-procedure rinses, rubber dam and high volume suction. 24 While not a 'digestive tract infection' , Ebola is an infection which can be transmitted from body fluids including those affecting the digestive tract. The virus can survive for several days outside the body and a person can become infected via the mouth. 25 It is common for people to be advised not to kiss those who are symptomatic with gastrointestinal infection. Although Ebola virus is not believed to commonly spread as a result of droplet generation, contact with mucous membranes of an affected person is a mechanism for transmission of the virus. Aerosol sprays bombardment of mucous membranes of someone with the disease is a potential mechanism to facilitate transmission of Ebola (or a digestive system infection) when the causative organism may be present in the mouth of those infected. Viruses are present in saliva of those very sick with Ebola. Droplet transmission of Ebola from aerosol spray has not been demonstrated to date, although there is a report of a healthcare worker inadvertently rubbing her eyes with soiled gloves who then developed Ebola disease. 26 Based on the limited evidence it would seem best to avoid aerosol spray generation from the mouth of someone with the disease.",

The surgery is more likely to become widely contaminated through aerosol sprays, therefore aerosol spray generation should be minimised. Experience with SARS highlights appropriate responses for a highly infectious high mortality respiratory infection. 28, 29 In the absence of negative pressure operating rooms there are products which can help to manage the air in an aerosol generating environment. 30 Past experience suggests that the dental team can be forgotten when new infections emerge. If we are alert and are clear about the information we need, we can ask for up to date answers and modify our practice accordingly. Public health organisations should consider appointing someone with responsibility for emerging infections and dentistry with strong links to both health protection colleagues responsible for emerging infection responses and dental professionals.
