Our histological and histochemical techniques are described elsewhere; also on frozen sections we did histochemical tests for calcium (glyoxal-bis-2-hydroxyanil and alizarin-red S). 1 In the control fetuses we did not find structural abnormalities in the muscle fibres (table); there were no opaque fibres except for scattered fibres at the edge of the sections. These fibres were the only ones that displayed calcium-positive staining in this group. However, in two at risk fetuses a significant percentage of dark opaque fibres (3' 5 -4 -3%) has been found. These fibres were intensely positive with both histochemical reactions for calcium (figure B). Further, some apparently normal fibres also displayed an increase of calcium content. Dark fibres were usually larger than normal and scattered among normal fibres; however, 5 these fibres had centrally located nuclei. Our findings accord with other observations from fetuses2,4,s at risk for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 2 In this report, as well as in that by Emery and Burt,2 the percentage of calcium-positive fibres is almost the same as that of opaque fibres and both are significantly high only in fetuses at risk. Hypereosinophilic and calcium-positive fibres might represent artifacts resulting from hypercontraction induced by injury during muscle dissection. 1 However, we carefully took away the whole muscle and in our counting of positive elements we excluded fibres at the periphery of sections. Moreover, we did not find any difference between pregnancies terminated by hysterotomy and the one terminated by prostaglandin not mentioned above. Artifacts seem unlikely.",

In a recent study of the anaerobic flora of the tonsils (to be published), we observed that the most prevalent anaerobic species (Bacteroides melaninogenicus) was frequently resistant on disc testing to 1 unit benzylpenicillin. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of penicillin and ampicillin were determined for 38 of these tonsillar isolates (table). Research into the drug histories of many of these children showed an alarming frequency of prescriptions for penicillin derivatives; this probably explains the high percentage of strains resistant to penicillin. Further studies are in progress to assess the penicillinase production by these oral strains.",

We have shown that orally administered metronidazole achieves a statistically significant reduction in the anaerobic tonsillar flora. Controlled studies are in progress to determine the therapeutic efficacy of metronidazole in tonsillitis. Department SIR,-Workers in Britain,' India,2 and Australia3 have noted \"coronavirus-like particles\" in the stools of children with diarrhoea and also in presumably normal individuals. The particles carry a regular array of projections on their surface, as coronaviruses do, but the size and shape of the particles is highly pleomorphic. There are a number of distinct types of particle, the morphology of which will be reviewed elsewhere.4 We have investigated a case of diarrhoea in a 2Z year-old Asian child who had visited Pakistan four months previously. Campylobacter and cysts of Entamceba histolytica were isolated from the stool, and the child was treated with two courses of metronidazole. Urological investigations were negative. The diarrhoea remitted and the child was discharged without follow-up.",

In close relationship to these particles were broad sheets of membraneous material, without distinctive morphology. An analogous pellet was fixed in buffered glutaraldehyde and osmic acid and embedded in Spurr resin, and stained sections were examined. The material of the pellet consisted essentially of two components. One was a number of large, almost empty envelopes 1.3-2-5 m long and 0-5-1-5 m wide, and whose wall consisted of a double layer of repeating subunits ( fig. 2) .
