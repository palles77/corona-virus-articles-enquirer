We identified a product of N/L*CRP*D-dimer as having an important predictive value for the severity of COVID-19. The cutoff value was 5.32. The negative predictive value of less than 5.32 for the N/L*CRP*D-dimer was 93.75%, while the positive predictive value was 46.03% in the test sets. The sensitivity and specificity were 89.47% and 67.42%. In the training sets, the negative and positive predictive values were 93.80% and 41.32%, respectively, with a specificity of 70.76% and a sensitivity of 89.87%.

The basic characteristics of the study population are shown in Table 1 . The patients with severe pneumonia tended to older. Also, patients with chronic comorbidities, such as high blood pressure (HBP), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), coronary heart disease (CHD), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, accounted for a larger proportion of the population in the severe pneumonia group. Relative to those with non-severe pneumonia, patients with severe pneumonia had significantly high serum WBC count and N, CRP, Cr, BUN, D-dimer levels and lower albumin and lymphocyte levels. The ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (N/L) was significantly higher in patients with severe pneumonia. In addition, no significant differences in ALT, AST, or time between onset and admission were apparent.",

The result was also confirmed in other research 13 . This is probably because the resistance of the elders against virus decreases with age increase, basic diseases, and many other factors. Moreover, the aggravation of the basic disease profile of elderly patients would also lead to deterioration in the face of the severe pneumonia.

To find a better predictor, we combined the three variables in different ways and analyzed the ROC curve for the new factors. Finally, the result showed that the product of N/L, CRP, and D-dimer (N/L*CRP*D-dimer) was a factor worth exploring. We performed an ROC curve analysis of N/L*CRP*D-dimer for diagnosing severe pneumonia. The AUC was 0.888 (95% CI: 0.856-0.921), with a specificity of 65.3% and a sensitivity of 95.7% (Figure 4).
