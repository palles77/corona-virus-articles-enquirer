Viruses belonging to the betanodavirus genus are the causative agents of viral encephalopathy and retinopathy, also known as viral nervous necrosis (VNN). VNN occurs in many species of fish and causes devastating economic effects on marine aquaculture worldwide [14] . The betanodaviruses have been isolated from more than 30 marine fish species from 14 families, striped jack and sea bass, for example. The betanodaviruses are classified into four genotypes based on the phylogenetic analysis of their genomic RNA2 (coat protein) sequences. The genotypes are: striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), barfin flounder nervous necrosis virus (BFNNV), tiger puffer nervous necrosis virus (TPNNV) and redspotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) [25, 29, 30] .",

            "text": "The replication of nodaviruses has been studied in a wide range of cultured cells. Among the known alphanodaviruses, only the Nodamura virus (NoV) has the ability to lethally infect suckling mice and suckling hamsters [10, 34] . When NoV or Flock House virus (FHV) genomic RNAs are introduced by transfection, they can replicate in a variety of cell types, including mammalian, insect, yeast, and plant, though none of these support virus replication in whole virus infection [2, 13, 20, 33, 35, 36] . In BHK-21 cells, controversy exists regarding the infectivity of NoV [1, 2, 13] , as the determinants of infectivity of the alphanodaviruses have not yet been established, and the specific receptors have also not been identified. The replication of betanodaviruses, on the other hand, is considered to be very temperature dependent because of the RdRp activity, the result being that fish constitute the narrow natural host range of such betanodaviruses. However, the mechanism of betanodavirus infection, which involves both viral factors and essential host factors, has not yet been elucidated. We recently suggested that betanodaviruses enter cells by endocytosis (manuscript in press). However, it is not known whether this virus can infect other animal species, particularly humans. The only report that has described the pathogenicity of the betanodaviruses in mammals, using genotypes of SJNNV and RGNNV, demonstrated that mice are not susceptible to betanodaviruses, as no clinical signs of infection manifested, and no virus was detected in the organs targeted by the betanodaviruses [3] .",

RGNNV-infected E-11 cells and human cells were incubated at 28 C for the number of hours indicated. Total RNA was subsequently prepared and RT-PCR was conducted.

The (\u00fe) RNA2 bands were detected from 9 h post-infection onward. These data imply that RGNNV had entered the cells and that the synthesis of the (\u00c0) RNA1 had begun immediately, reaching its maximum level between 9 and 12 h after infection. On the other hand, no significant (\u00c0) RNA1 and (\u00fe) RNA2 bands were detected in the infected HeLa, A549, and 293T cells, even at 36 h post-infection ( Fig. 3B-D, left panel) .

We initially tested whether RGNNV could bind to several human cell lines at RGNNV replication-permissive temperature. RGNNV attached not only to E-11 cells but to each of the human cell lines tested in this experiment. The extent of binding of RGNNV to the cells was essentially the same with the E-11 and human cell lines. Treatment of the cells with neuraminidase before viral infection clearly reduced viral binding to the cells. Therefore, these results clearly suggest that human cell lines can support the binding of the betanodavirus, possibly by sialic acid, as is the case with fish E-11 cells. Desler et al. reported that viral coat protein expression was detected in HeLa cells when these cells were infected with Dicentrarchus labrax encephalitis virus (DlEV) [7] , a member of the betanodavirus genus belonging to the RGNNV genotype [15, 30] . However, the data presented by Desler et al. did not confirm that the human cell line HeLa is susceptible to betanodavirus infection, as their results showed only a limited number of cells which were diffusely stained with antibody against the betanodavirus. They reported that HeLa cells infected with the betanodavirus displayed no CPE. They did not analyze the replication form of viral RNAs. It is therefore possible that they detected virus which was bound to the cell membrane but which had not replicated in the cells. It has been reported that (\u00fe) RNA1 from the greasy grouper nervous necrosis virus (GGNNV), which belongs to the RGNNV genotype, could replicate and accumulate in HeLa and BSRT7=5 cells when transfected with in vitro-transcribed-(\u00fe) RNA1 [9] . Our data also confirm the previous observation that human cell lines can support the replication of the betanodavirus when cells are transfected with viral RNAs. In addition, we clearly established for the first time that human cells can produce progeny viruses when transfected with viral RNAs. The cell receptors for the betanodaviruses have not been identified yet, although it has been suggested that sialic acid is involved in RGNNV binding to SSN-1 cells [22] . Our data suggest that human cells may lack specific receptors for the betanodavirus and that the penetration of the virus into the cells did not occur, although human cells can support the replication of the betanodavirus when viral RNAs are used for transfection.",

It has been demonstrated that the RNA2-encoded coat protein controls host specificity. Indeed, a variable region of RNA2, encoding the C-terminal region of the coat protein, is used to divide betanodaviruses into four genotypes [25, 29, 30] . In addition, the C-terminal sequences of the coat protein are displayed on the surface of the virion [38] , suggesting that this region interacts with the cell surface. This is the only viral factor so far identified as a possible determinant of host specificity in the family Nodaviridae. Further detailed studies are needed to determine whether human cells lack the specific receptors for the betanodavirus.",

            "text": "It has also been suggested that the replication of the betanodavirus is temperature dependent, because neither viral coat protein nor viral genome replication could be detected in infected cells that were incubated at a non-permissive temperature [5, 6] . The optimal temperature supporting betanodavirus infection differs between genotypes [15] . The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the alphanodaviruses FHV and NoV [2] was affected less when the assay was conducted at a temperature above 30 C. However, almost no replication was detected with FHV and NoV when they were incubated at 33.5 C or 39 C. In our experiment, no (\u00c0) RNA1 synthesis was detected at 37 C in RGNNV-infected E-11 cells even though this temperature has no effect on the attachment of the virus to the cells (data not shown). Therefore, the betanodavirus in its present form cannot infect human cells maintained at 37 C, probably due to the absence of receptors for the betanodavirus and the non-permissive temperature for RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.",
