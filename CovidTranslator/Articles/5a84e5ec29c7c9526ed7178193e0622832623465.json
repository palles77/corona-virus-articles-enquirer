Cytological examination of vaginal smears was of no diagnostic value in confirming infection in inapparently infected cats. Bacteriological responses after primary or secondary challenge with the CEM organism wore essentially similar, with one exception, a female cat in which there was possible evidence of local immunity persisting after the primary infection. Efforts to reactivate shedding subsequent to the immediate post-challenge period were unsuccessful. Throughout the experimental period, the cats remained sere-negative to the complement-fixation test, and they failed to develop any significant increase in the levels of antibody activity as measured by the kinetics-based ELISA or KELA system. On day 89 after primary challenge, the cats were euthanized and various sites in the genitourinary tract and the internal lilac lymphatic glands subjected to bacteriological and pathological examination for evidence of CEM infection with negative results.",

INTRODUCTION Various studies have been undertaken to establish the natural and experimental host range of the causal organism of contagious equine metritis (CEM). The latter is a transmissive venereal disease of the horse, first reported in Britain and Ireland in 1977 [1, 2] and shown to be caused by a gram-negative coccobaciUus [3, 4] which still awaits taxonomic classification [5] . The horse remains the only species in which spontaneous disease with this organism has been reported. Whereas CEM has been experimentally reproduced in donkey mares [6] , cattle, sheep and pigs have been refractive to experimental challenge [7] . Limited subclinical infections have been established in mice, rabbits and guinea-pigs, with mice the most susceptible of the three species examined [8, 9] .",

Assays were conducted on Gilford EIA-PR50's (Gilford Instruments, Inc., Oberlin, OH) interfaced with a PDP11/34A computer (Digital Instru-ment Corp, Maynard, MA). A sequencing program was developed in which the EIA-PR50 mode selection and operation were placed under direct computer control. The rate of reaction between bound peroxidase and substrate was determined from three absorbence readings taken and transmitted to the computer at 4 min intervals beginning 5 rain after addition of substrate solution. These intervals provided a linear relationship between absorbence values and time so that the resultant sample regression coefficient or slope, representing the rate of enzymatic conversion of the substrate, was directly proportional to the quantity of antibody present in the sample [16] .",

The same strain of CEMO at a higher in vitro passage level had previously been used to transmit CEM to a group of experimental pony mares [14] . Whilst the challenge dose may possibly have been sub-liminal for the cat, this was thought unlikely as it closely approximated those used in other transmission experiments in which CEM was successfully reproduced [6, 19, 20] . In an earlier study in which evidence of dose-dependency had been noted, the inoculum contained approximately 10 4 fewer organisms [19] .

The duration of CEM infection was appreciably shorter than that reported in strains of albino Swiss [8] , ICR [9] or CBA/N and LAFffJ mice (P. J. Timoney, S. J. Shin and R. H. Jacobsen, submitted for publication). In contrast to the response of pony mares following reexposure to CEMO [21] , there was no significant reduction in the shedding period compared with the corresponding interval after primary challenge. The method and frequency of sampling [24] were not considered to have had any major influence on the pattern of isolations of CEMO. Two of the cats that were refractive to CEM had intercurrent infections of the genital tract primarily with E. coli and to a lesser extent Staphylococcus and Streptococcus spp. Although strains of staphylococci and streptococci have been shown to have a selective inhibitory effect on the growth of CEMO in vitro [25, 26] , it is uncertain whether such organisms could have a similar effect in rive, precluding the establishment of infection in these cats. Failure to establish long-term CEM infection in any of the cats prevented a comparison of the relative persistence of the organism in the anterior and caudal genital tract; ruled out an assessment of the possible effect of oestrus on reactivation of shedding in the carrier animal; and negatived attempts at venereal transmission of CEMO.",

J. Timoney, S. J. Shin and R. H. Jacobsen, submitted for publication). Recovery of a heavy growth of Streptococcus spp. from the genital tract of two of the female cats though surprising, is of questionable significance in relation to the negative findings for CEM. It is conjectural whether CEMO might have been detected in some of the cat tissues using the immunofluorescence technique. Acland et al. [20] found immunofluorescence much more sensitive than culture for demonstrating organisms in a greater range of sites in CEM infected mares. They observed stained organisms in tissues harvested 116 days after challenge, 62 days after the last positive culture had been obtained from an experimental mare.",

Various groups of workers have found the complement-fixation test to be insensitive for the demonstration of serological responses in CEM-infected pony mares [21, 27, 28] and donkey mares (P. J. Timoney, P. J. O'Reilly, J. F. McArdle and J. Ward, submitted for publication). In the experimental study by Rommel and Sahu [28] , pony mares did not develop detectable complement-fixing antibodies after primary or secondary challenge with CEMO, and only two of five mares responded with low to moderate titres after a third intrauterine inoculation. Sahu et al. [29] found the ELISA markedly superior to the complement-fixation and certain other serological tests for the detection of CEM-infected mares. However, even using the kinetics-based ELISA or KELA system, which is a highly sensitive technique for quantitation of serum antibody levels [17] , very little evidence was found to indicate that the cats in this study, even those that became infected, responded serologically on single or repeated exposure to CEMO.",
