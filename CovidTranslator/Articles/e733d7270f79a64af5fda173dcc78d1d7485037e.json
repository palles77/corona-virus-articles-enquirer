Following the initial infection with stock HCV/229E, several cultures were established of which two (HV t and IIV4) have been maintained by continous passage for two years. These eultures have shed high titres of infectious virus continuously into the supernatant fluid since their initiation. The persistently infected ceils were resistant to homologous superinfection but supported polio virus replication to normal titres. Preliminary tests indicated that 50--100 percent of the cells contain virus. Neither interferon nor reverse transeriptase could be detected in these cultures and the presence of defective interfering particles could not be demonstrated. VH t and V H 4 coronaviruses, isolated from these persistently infected cultures (HV) and identified by 229E antiserum neutralization, were more eytoeidal than the parent virus as judged by plaque characteristics and CPE however, they were indistinguishable on the basis of density, EM morphology, a.nd genome size. Present evidence indicates that temperature plays an important but as yet undetermined role in the establishment and maintenance of stable 229 E persistently infected cell cultures. 0304-8608/81/0069/0117/$02.60 6, 128--132 (1975/76).",

Thus it seems evident t h a t closer a t t e n t i o n should be given to the existence of chronic i n a p p a r e n t eoronaviral infections of humans. Increasingly, interest is being focussed on h u m a n coronavirus because of its suggested i n v o l v e m e n t in persistent infection (Balkan endemic nephropathy) (1) and its possible etiological role in multiple sclerosis (MS) (3, 20) . But, the inability to temporally assay h u m a n tissues for HCV or HECV after acute infection has made the investigation of persistent h u m a n coronavirus infection very difficult. This difficulty is further compounded because coronaviruses are notoriously fastidious, their host range is usually restricted to the n a t u r a l host, and there are no suitable h u m a n coronavirus models of in vitro persistent infection reported to date.",

They found that viral replication was thermosensitive in cell cultures persistently infected with strain JHM, although the virus progeny from the persistent infection were not thermolabile. In our HV system, some temperature effect is associated with both the establishment and maintenance of persistence, however, further experiments are required to determine the role of temperature in this virus/host system. Since the virus isolated from the persistently infected cells (HV) caused more pronounced CPE than 229 E virus in L 132 cells, it seems probable that changes have occurred in both the virus and the host cells during the early stages of the establishment of persistence.
