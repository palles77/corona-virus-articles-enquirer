Deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was named 2019 novel coronavirus Disease . Based on the current epidemiological investigation, the incubation period is 1-14 days, mostly 3-7 days. Fever, dry cough, and fatigue are the main manifestations [1] .With the spread of the epidemic, other cases have been found in other parts of China and abroad. The sources of infection seen so far are mainly patients with new type of coronavirus infection, which are mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and close contact. Patients diagnosed with this disease must be treated in isolation. Through clinical observation, many patients developed anxiety and sleep disturbances after isolation treatment. Anxiety, as a kind of psychological stress, will trigger a series of physiological events and cause a decrease in immunity [2] .",

Progressive muscle relaxation is a deep muscle relaxation method based on the principle that muscle tension is the physiological response of the human body to irritating thinking [3] . This technology was developed by Jacobsen in 1938, in which the body and mind are greatly relieved from any tension and anxiety. In a study by Aksu [4] : Progressive muscle relaxation improves sleep quality in patients with pneumonectomy. Progressive muscle relaxation is easy to learn, does not require specific time and place, and does not require special technology and equipment. Therefore, this study aims to explore the effect of progressive muscle relaxation on sleep quality and anxiety in patients with COVID-19.",

The patients were randomly divided into two groups (experimental group and control group), and the participants were intervened in the order of the beds. This study is a randomized controlled clinical trial approved by the Ethics Committee of Hainan Provincial People's Hospital.

The Sleep Condition Self-Assessment Scale (SRSS) is designed to assess the sleep quality of hospitalized patients. There are 10 items in total. Each item has a 5-point scale (1-5). The higher the score, the more serious the sleep problem. This scale has a minimum score of 10 (basically no sleep problems) and a maximum score of 50 (most severe).

The researchers then instructed the experimental group on how to relax using Jacobson's relaxation techniques (progressive muscle relaxation and deep breathing), and after determining that they had learned how to relax, the patients performed this within 20 to 30 minutes each day, training for 5 consecutive days. The trainee chooses a relaxed supine position, and starts with the hand through the hospital call system under the guidance of the medical staff, followed by the upper limbs, shoulders, head, neck, chest, abdomen, and finally the lower limbs. Right, if the trainer first left arm and then right arm, the rest of the movement can follow this principle. During muscle tension, the action can be performed for 10-15 seconds, and the relaxation process can be 15-20 seconds; each group of muscles is repeatedly trained 3 times in sequence; the training time is generally selected once at noon and before falling asleep, each time 20-30 minute. At the same time, the patient takes a deep breath, inhales through his nose, and exhales through his mouth. Patients in the control group received routine care during this period. The anxiety and sleep quality of the two groups were measured after the 5-day intervention.",

The results show that PMR is an effective way to reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality in patients with COVID-19. The results of studies on the effects of progressive muscle relaxation on anxiety levels in young women [5] , prenatal anxiety [6] , and early breast cancer [7] female patients are consistent with this study. In addition, our study found that PMR also affects the quality of sleep in patients with COVID-19. Previous studies have shown the impact of this technology on the sleep quality of other patients, and found that PMR can reduce complications and improve sleep quality of patients with fractures [8] . Seyedi [9] and others also showed that PMR can reduce fatigue and improve sleep quality in patients with COPD. PMR is also effective for pain intensity and sleep quality after cesarean section. Although the efficacy of this method has been confirmed in domestic studies, it is the first time it has been used in patients with COVID-19. Due to the strong infectivity of the disease, PMR training can be implemented remotely to reduce the use of hypnotic drugs and reduce the risk of medical infection. The reason for the decrease in anxiety of patients after PMR training may be the balance between the anterior and hypothalamic nucleus. By reducing the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, side effects of stress and anxiety can be prevented, and physical and mental relaxation can be increased [10] . Similar to other studies, patients in this study achieved relaxation by learning how to regularly tighten and relax muscles and identify symptoms of stress.",

In a study by Hasanpour-Dehkordi [12] and others on patients with chronic pain, two methods of muscle relaxation and hypnosis were used to reduce pain, but the results showed that neither method was effective.

According to clinical observation, anxiety and sleep disturbances increased significantly after isolation treatment. Some sleep-promoting drugs may have respiratory depression, and the new coronary virus mainly affects lung tissue, and the use of drugs may increase respiratory depression. Therefore, we use asymptotic muscle relaxation training to alleviate the anxiety and improve sleep quality of patients with COVID-19. This training can be performed remotely and multiple times after one training session, without directly facing the patient, reducing doctor-patient contact and reducing medical infection risk. Currently, COVID-19 has a large number of cases in South Korea, Japan, Iran, and Italy. I hope our clinical research will be helpful to our country's clinical treatment and the above countries.",
