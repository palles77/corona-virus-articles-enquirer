Methods: Ethnographic interviews were first conducted to identify the common psychological and behavioral responses to the outbreak. This was followed by a case-control study of 235 consecutive pregnant women recruited during the SARS epidemic, and a historical cohort of 939 pregnant women recruited a year before the outbreak. Both cohorts completed standardized rating scales on depression, anxiety, and social support. Results: Women in the SARS cohort adopted behavioral strategies to mitigate their risk of contracting infection. However, pregnant women tended to overestimate the risk of contracting SARS and nearly a third of the women were homebound. The anxiety level of the SARS cohort was slightly higher than that of the pre-SARS control. No statistical difference was found between the depression levels of the two cohorts. Conclusion: The improved social support experienced by pregnant women during SARS might have buffered the stress associated with an outbreak. However, clinicians should monitor for overestimation of infectious risk among pregnant women. D",

Pregnant women are particularly affected, as they are naturally concerned about the safety of their fetus. Any mortality would be double-fold. For some infections, like SARS, pregnancy seemed to worsen the clinical course and outcomes [2, 3] . Also, some therapeutic agents are potentially teratogenic. Ribavirin, for instance, a key treatment for SARS, has documented teratogenicity in animals [4] . Thus, a SARS-infected pregnant mother would face the dilemma of having to choose between rejecting ribavirin treatment or accepting its potential teratogenic effects on the fetus. Mortalities of pregnant women in outbreaks are widely and dramatically publicized in the media, which only escalates the fear and worries of pregnant women further.",
