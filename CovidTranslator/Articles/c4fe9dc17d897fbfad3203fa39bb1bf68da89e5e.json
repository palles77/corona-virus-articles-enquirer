After the ROC government moved its seat to Taiwan, the Constitution continued to apply to the entirety of China in theory. When the ROC government and the \"congress\" went into exile in the island of Taiwan, most deputies of the \"congress,\" who were elected by the people in China, also followed the government to Taiwan. They continued to represent the people in China under the rule of the Chinese Communists. The National Assembly amended Temporary Provisions Act by adding a provision which authorized the President to issue ordinances for electing new congressional delegates in addition to the original delegates. 489 The original delegates continued to represent their old congressional districts even after their original terms expired. Thus, for 40 years the congressional deputies were in fact permanent members of the \"congress\" until the 1991 amendment of the Constitution. Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek could control the congressional deputies as his puppets because their livelihood depended on the KMT Party's support.",

He created some political slogans collectively characterized here as the \"one China dogma.\" The one China dogma is, \"There is only one China; China means the Republic of China; the Republic of China's territory consists of China proper and the island of Taiwan; and the People's Republic of China (PRC) illegally occupies the Republic of China's territory.\" 492 From the beginning, Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek's one-China dogma was a myth. When the ROC took exile in Taiwan in 1949, it had lost China forever. The Nationalists lost the trust of the people in China due to the mismanagement of the ROC officials. By 1950, the PRC government was firmly established, controlling China proper except for two small offshore islands (Kinmen and Matsu). In contrast, the ROC government only controlled the two Chinese small offshore islands and the island of Taiwan which was not China's territory. Thus, while there is only one China, China could not mean the ROC; the PRC did not \"illegally occupy the ROC's territory\" as the one-China dogma claimed. Although Jiang (Chiang) created the myth to legitimize his authority and power in Taiwan, since he was the paramount leader of the KMT Party, the Party and the government were able to permeate the dogma throughout the Taiwan society. 491 See Chen Yi-nan, ROC forced citizenship on unwary Taiwanese, THE TAIPEI TIMES, Jan 20, 2011, p. 8., available at http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/ 2011/01/20/2003493942. Last visited, 07/16/2015. 492 \"One China dogma (i zhong jiao tiao in Chinese)\" is not an official name of a teaching or political philosophy. Rather, it is a general term referring to the collective political slogans of Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek described in the quotation.",

After the 1951 Peace Treaty of San Francisco was concluded, he still intended to retake the China mainland. In an attempt to motivate his army, he created a slogan: \"Counter attack the mainland (Chinese Communists); retake the lost territory.\" In 1964, on the eve of France switching its recognition from the ROC to the PRC, French President De Gaulle called Jiang (Chiang) Kai-shek and advised him of the imminent French action and that if Jiang (Chiang) would declare the ROC a new State limiting its territory to the island of Taiwan, France would recognize the new State and the ROC as its legitimate government.

The withdrawal of the recognition of the ROC by the US demonstrated that the US regarded the ROC as a government. As it was discussed in Chapter 2, The State and Sovereignty, in State practice, while recognition of a State cannot be withdrawn, recognition of a government may be withdrawn. The withdrawal of recognition of the ROC by the United States and other States did not make the ROC a new State as some people in Taiwan have claimed. Withdrawal of recognition is an act of destruction of a relationship, not an act of creation of a new entity.",

Rogers 510 stated, \"It is fundamental that such questions as whether a foreign country or a foreign government should be formally recognized are problems that are not to be solved by the courts, but are political matters that are to be decided by the executive and legislative departments of the Government. On such topics the President and the Secretary of State speak for the United States, and the courts are obligated to follow their pronouncements. Nevertheless, the US courts, in deciding the application of an international treaty or a municipal law, had occasions to give their reasons that the ROC was not a State. Two cases involving the application of the Warsaw Convention 512 confirmed that the ROC was not a State. In the first case, John Lee and Margaret Lee v. China Airlines Ltd., 513 two passengers on a flight from Hong Kong 514 to San Francisco sued China Airlines in a US federal court sitting in California for injuries caused by a sudden drop of the airplane of 31,000 ft in the air, off the coast of California. The defendant argued that the US federal court had no jurisdiction to try the case. The plaintiffs argued that the federal court had jurisdiction, and, if their action were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, they would be compelled to bring the action abroad, either in Taiwan 515 or in Hong Kong, 516 where they would not receive an adequate hearing of their claims because, they argued, the Warsaw Convention would not apply to either Hong Kong or Taiwan. The court, in holding that the Warsaw Convention applied and it had no subject matter jurisdiction according to the Convention, dismissed the action. 517 The court added that if the plaintiffs sued in either Hong Kong or Taiwan, \"[t]he Warsaw Convention will figure prominently in the decision making process over there because both Hong Kong and Taiwan adhere to it.\" 518 The court statement that \"Taiwan adhere[s] to [the Warsaw Convention]\" implied that Taiwan was a contracting party of the Warsaw Convention. It should be noted, however, that at the time when the accident occurred, while the PRC government of China ratified and adhered to the Warsaw Convention in July Taiwan had neither ratified nor adhered to the Warsaw Convention. Thus, the reason that the court ruled that Taiwan was a contracting party was because it regarded Taiwan a part of China and covered by the Warsaw Convention; the ROC was not a State.",

When a similar proposal was made again in 1961, the US Government (the Kennedy Administration) invoked an article in the UN Charter to create a procedural barrier for any proposal to change the representation with respect to China in the United Nations. The General Assembly adopted a resolution proposed by the US Government to designate the representation question 527 decreased correspondingly. In 1970, the Nixon Administration was willing to allow representatives of the PRC to take China's seat in the General Assembly and in the Security Council on a condition that the representatives of the ROC remained in the General Assembly. 537 The PRC, on the other hand, insisted that it would take over China's seat only if the representatives of the ROC were expelled from the United Nations. 538 The US Government refused to accept the PRC's condition, and again proposed that the representation question was an \"important question.\" 539 The proposal was adopted by a narrower margin this time. 540 A proposal by Albania, which followed, to expel the representatives of the ROC was again defeated. 541 In Council. 542 The General Committee 543 prepared a General Assembly agenda which included both the United States proposal calling for \"the continued right of representation of the ROC [in the General Assembly]\" 544 and Albania's proposal calling for the representatives of the PRC to take China's seat as well as for the expulsion of the representatives of the ROC from the United Nations. 545 In the General Assembly, the United States proposal to make the question of expelling the representatives of the ROC from the United Nations an \"important question\" was, for the first time, defeated. 546 Thus, China's \"representation question\" was to be decided by a majority vote.

In 1991, he terminated the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communists Rebellion Act 552 pursuant to its provision. 553 The most important reform was restructuring of the \"congress\" to reflect the reality that the ROC no longer governed the territory and the people under the control of the PRC. Up until that time, the \"congress\" included \"representatives\" of regions in mainland China that were under the control of the PRC. In order to reform composition of the deputies in the three houses of the \"congress\" to reflect the reality, Lee initiated an amendment to the ROC Constitution by the National Assembly in 1991. The Amendment of the Nanjing (Nanking) Constitution of 1946 554 changed the structure of the \"congress.\" The \"permanent\" deputies who represented the people who never elected them were persuaded to retire with favorable entitlements to quell their opposition. The amendments were welcomed by the people of Taiwan. However, the amended ROC Constitution does not forsake the one-China dogma, in particular the ROC's claim of sovereignty over \"Mainland China.\" The 1991 Amendment consists of 10 Articles. The most important provisions concern the formation of the members of the three houses of the \"congress.\" The first three Articles provide the number of deputies in the National Assembly, 555 the Institute of Legislation (the Legislature Yuan), 556 and the Institute of Control (the Control Yuan). 557 The Amendment creates two geographic regions for the purpose of selecting the deputies: \"the Free Region\" and \"the Entire Country.\" 558 The term \"the Free Region,\" by implication, refers to the territory under the actual control of the ROC: the \"Province of Taiwan\" and China's two offshore islands, Kinmen and Matsu. The term \"the Entire Country,\" by implication, refers to both the territory under the control of the ROC and the territory under the control of the PRC. Thus, the amended ROC Constitution still applies, in theory, to entire China as well as Taiwan. Under the amended Constitution, the people in \"Mainland China\" still have representation in the ROC's new \"congress.\" For each house of the \"congress,\" the number of deputies elected by the residents of cities or prefectures in the Free Region (Taiwan) is determined by the size of the population of the cities or the prefectures. In addition, a fixed number of deputies collectively represent the entire population of \"the Entire Country.\" 559 The latter are appointed by political parties according to a system of proportional representation: each political party gains additional seats proportionate to the votes it receives in the congressional election. Thus, the people in \"Mainland China\" are represented by the deputies selected to represent \"the Entire Country.\"",

However, in the same interview, Lee also stated that \"the ROC was a sovereign country since 1912.\" 573 Was it 1912 or 1991 when the ROC was established as a \"State\"?

Then, the 1991 Amendment to the ROC Constitution also had the same effect of making both the ROC and the PRC States in 1991.

In the television broadcast, during the interview while the German Deutsche Welle TV Asian expert Dr. Guenther Knabe asked questions in English, Lee replied in Mandarin Chinese with a simultaneous English translation. Lee's Chinese words that were rendered \"state-to-state\" in English translation were \"Guo (country) and Guo (country).\" Since both the Chinese terms for the Republic of China or Zhong (Chung) Hua Min Guo and the People's Republic of China or Zhong (Chung) Hua Jen Min Kung He Guo end with the word Guo (country), Lee's statement \"Guo to Guo relationship\" in fact referred to \"the Republic of China\" to \"the People's Republic of China\" relationship. As it was explained before, though both the ROC and the PRC use the word \"Guo (country)\" at the end of their Chinese names, both the ROC and the PRC are governments of the State of China.

The WHO shared Kofi Annan's view on the political status of the ROC, and referred to Taiwan as \"the Taiwan Province, China\" in its website. 585 If Taiwan was a province of China, the ROC could not be a State.",

In fact, Lee's statement that there was no need to declare independence in the TV interview negated any interpretation that the statement was itself a declaration of independence. A declaration for the establishment of a new State is a solemn statement and should be open and clear. The purpose of such a declaration is to make the existence of a new state open and unambiguous to the population and other States. Every State has a birthday. A new state cannot gradually evolve into existence. The modern State practice is to make such declaration by the political leader, such as the Executive head of the government, or representatives of the people, such as the legislature, in a document officially executed and announced in public to the international community. Lee's statement, made in an interview by a foreign reporter in a closed chamber, not supported by any formal document, was not a serious declaration, which would establish statehood.",

In its supporting documents, the ROC requested the United Nations to allow the State of China to be represented by two governments: the PRC and the ROC.

Ban cited \"the UN's one-China policy based on Resolution No. 2758\" as his grounds for rejection. 604 The ROC's attempts to join the United Nations have thus far failed. 605 The failure cannot be solely attributed to obstruction by the PRC government. There was a legal aspect in the ROC's applications that was repugnant to the principle of international law. The United Nations is an organization formed by States; only political institutions with statehood may be members. Yet, the ROC government never declared establishment of a new State independent of China and never applied for a new membership as a new State.

Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1982. 3. US POSITION ON THE POLITICAL STATUS OF THE ROC BEFORE LEE TENG-HUI Whatever the two Jiang (Chiang)s' characterization of the ROC in the one-China dogma, there was no doubt to other States that the ROC was a government of the State of China from the very beginning when it was established in 1912 and was a government after it moved its seat to the island of Taiwan in 1949. The United States' treatment of the ROC is particularly relevant, since it became the occupying state of Taiwan and the dominant power in the region after World War II. Its Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches all held the same position-that the ROC was only a government of the State of China. A closer analysis of the view of each branch follows.A. The Executive BranchAs discussed in Chapter 2, The State and Sovereignty, it is the power of the Executive head, the President in the United States, to grant diplomatic recognition. It was pointed out before that the Executive branch of the United States considered the ROC a government of the State of China from the time when it was established in 1912. Its recognition of the ROC in 1913 was recognition of the government, since the United States had long recognized the State of China before 1913.The ROC did not become a State independent of China after it moved its seat to the island of Taiwan. From October 25, 1971 on, the PRC government has replaced the ROC government to represent China in the United Nations. The US Government, however, continued to recognize the ROC in Taiwan as the representative government of China until 1979. 501 On December 30, 1978, the Carter Administration finally accorded recognition to the PRC and simultaneously withdrew its recognition of the ROC 502 When the US recognized the PRC, it did not recognize the PRC as a new State, but recognized it as the representative government of China. Since the State which the PRC represented was still China, the United States had to withdraw simultaneously its501  See Ruan Ming, Time to Put an End to Fallacy of \"One China,\" TAIPEI TIMES, 11",

On his way to China, Powell gave an interview to a CNN reporter on October 25, 2004. During the interview, Powell made two remarks. The first remark was, \"[t]here is only one China; Taiwan is not independent. It does not enjoy sovereignty as a nation.\" His second remark was, \"[w]e want to see both sides not take unilateral action that would prejudice an eventual outcome, a reunification that all parties are seeking.\" 589 While Powell's view that \"[all parties] are seeking a reunification\" was not correct, his first statement that \"[The ROC] does not enjoy sovereignty as nation\" simply reflected the position of the US Government. A senior US officer repeated the US position on the political status of the ROC in 2007. In September 2007, Dennis Wilder, Senior Director for Asian Affairs of the White House National Security Council, said that \"Taiwan, or the Republic of China, is not at this point a state in the international community.\" 590",
