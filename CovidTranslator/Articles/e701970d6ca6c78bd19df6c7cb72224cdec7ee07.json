In this study, to define the cis-acting elements for viral replication and infectivity, The 5 0 UTR swapping chimeric clones pTLV8 and pSHSP5 were constructed based on two different genotypes full-length infectious cDNA clone pAPRRS and pSHE backbones. Between them, vTLV8 could be rescued from pTLV8 and had similar virological properties to vAPRRS, including phenotypic characteristic and RNA synthesis level. However, pSHSP5 exhibited no evidence of infectivity. Taken together, the results presented here demonstrate that only the 5 0 UTR of type 1 PRRSV did not affect the infectivity and replication of type 2 PRRSV in vitro. The 5 0 UTR of type 2 PRRSV could be functionally replaced by its counterpart from type 1.",

            "text": "The 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) of positive-sense, singlestranded RNA viruses has been demonstrated to play a key role in the regulation of viral replication and many biological properties. Research on many positive-sense RNA viruses has shown that their important secondary structure in the 5 0 UTR protects against degradation by exonucleases (Gallie, 1998) . For example, the 5 0 cloverleaf plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability of poliovirus RNA (Barton et al., 2001 ) and a hairpin motif located close to the 5 0 end is believed to be important for the stabilization of the RNA (TR and B, 1989) . In Dengue virus, the 5 0 UTR is also critical for RNA synthesis because a stem-loop RNA structure at the 5 0 end promotes specific RNA synthesis (Alvarez et al., 2005; Lodeiro et al., 2009 ) and a binding site for viral RNA-dependent-RNA polymerase (RdRp) at the 5 0 end of the genome facilitates template recognition at the 3 0 end of the genome via long-range RNA-RNA interactions (Filomatori et al., 2007) . The 5 0 end of the Aichi virus genome encodes RNA elements important for both negative-strand and positive-strand RNA synthesis (Nagashima et al., 2005b) . In addition to involvement in the stability of the genome, the cloverleaf structure at the 5 0 end of the poliovirus genome has been demonstrated to be essential for both plus-and minus-strand RNA synthesis (Andino et al., 1990; Gamarnik and Andino, 1998; Herold and Andino, 2000) . Furthermore, in the case of alphaviruses, flaviviruses and some picornaviruses, the 5 0 UTR has also been shown to contain distinct core promoter elements for RNA synthesis (Frolov et al., 2001; Frolov et al., 1998; Nagashima et al., 2005a) . In addition, the 5 0 UTR affects translational control. Internal ribosome entry site (Mihalek et al., 1999) function has been found in the 5 0 UTR of some members of the Flaviviridae (Dumas et al., 2003) and Picornaviridae (Rijnbrand et al., 2000 (Rijnbrand et al., , 1997 .",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) emerged in the late 1990s in Europe and North America, resulting in tremendous economic loss to the swine industry. The PRRS viruses (PRRSV) isolated from Europe and North America display huge diversity in genetic and serological performance, although they induce indistinguishable clinical manifestations (Halbur et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999) . As a result, PRRSV has been characterized into two distinct genotypes, European type 1 and North American type 2 (Wang et al., 2008) . PRRSV is a small, enveloped RNA virus, a member of the genus Arterivirus, family Arteriviridae, order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder, 2001) . The PRRSV genome consists of at least ten open reading frames (ORFs), which are flanked by the 5 0 and 3 0 UTRs. The 5 0 UTRs of the (approximately 220 and 190 nucleotides (nt) , respectively) and share approximately 60% nucleotide homology (Forsberg, 2005; Hanada et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2011) . Nevertheless, highly conserved stem-loop structures have been identified in the leader of all PRRSV strains, which are believed to play a part in viral replication (Oleksiewicz et al., 1999) . PRRSV adopts a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism for sg mRNA transcription. The structural proteins are translated from the 5 0 ends of a nested set of co-terminal sg (Khromykh et al., 2003) mRNA2 to 7 (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) ; (Alexander and Pasternak, 2006; Pasternak et al., 2006; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995) . With the exception of the smallest sg mRNA7, each sg mRNA is structurally polycistronic but functionally monocistronic because that only the 5 0 -proximal ORF is translated. However, sg mRNA2 is bicistronic and codes for ORFs 2a and 2b (Meulenberg et al., 1993b) . The key elements that join the leader sequence to different segments (mRNA bodies) are the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS), which are essential for joining the leader to the body. For most coronaviruses and arteriviruses, the 5 0 leader sequences are just the 5 0 -terminal portions of the 5 0 UTR (Born et al., 2005) , but PRRSV 5 0 leader consists of its entire 5 0 UTR.",

In this study, we conducted inter-genotypic 5 0 UTR swapping with the PRRSV infectious full-length cDNA clones pAPRRS and pSHE, in order to investigate the regulatory function of PRRSV 5 0 UTR and the cis-acting elements in viral replication and infectivity. Our results demonstrated that replacement of the complete 5 0 UTR of type 2 PRRSV by that of type 1 allowed all functions of the recipient virus to be maintained. However, 5 0 UTR of type 1 could not be substituted with its counterpart of type 2. It could be accounted for the TRS-related stem-loop structure disruption. The resulting chimeric virus was genetically stable and displayed similar biologic characteristics to the parental virus, with respect to infectivity, growth curve and sg mRNA transcription in vitro. This is the first report that the nidovirus 5 0 UTR can be replaced with that of a different genotype without functional alterations. Our findings suggest that high-ordered RNA structure plays an essential role in the replication of PRRSV. Thus, we can use this platform for future studies to define the basic biology of PRRSV.",

Two nucleotides, ''at'', were inserted between TRS and ''AUG'' to create the Nde I restrict endonulease site between the end of the 5 0 UTR and the translation initiation codon of ORF1. The mutant fragment was transferred subsequently into the corresponding region of pAPRRS using Sph I in front of the T7 promoter and Afl II at nt 1688 in pAPRRS (Yuan and Wei, 2008) . As a result, the mutant pTLNd4 was created. The Pac I restriction enzyme site was also created through the insertion of four nucleotides, ''ttaa'', ahead of TRS to create the mutant pPa2. These plasmids are shown in Fig. 1C . The primer pairs SFLNd/SRLNd and SFPac/SRPac used for PCR mutagenesis are listed in Table 1 . pLVNd1 is a shuttle plasmid that was generated by truncating the genomic sequences in the full-length cDNA clone pSHE between the Not I site ahead of the CMV promoter and the Nde I site behind TRS, and was cloned into pBluescript SK\u00fe vector. Following this, the 5 0 UTR of type 2 clone pTLNd4 was replaced by that of the type 1 strain to construct the chimeric clone pTLV8 using these two restriction enzyme sites. All of the plasmids were verified by restricted enzymatic mapping and nucleotide sequencing (Shanghai Sunny Inc, China).",

When passaged in MARC-145 cells, pTLNd4 and pAPRRS developed CPE at 3-4dpi. When approximately 80% cytopathic effect (CPE) had developed, viral supernatants from the infected MARC-145 cells were harvested and designated vTLNd4 and vAPRRS (P1), respectively. Both the transfected BHK-21 cell monolayers and infected MARC-145 cell monolayers were examined via IFA using MAb against two genotypes of PRRSV N protein. The results revealed that the similar N protein expression level for pAPRRS and pTLNd4 tranfected wells. Moreover, N protein expression of type 1 WT, pSHE, showed comparable level with that of type 2 WT. while only a few isolated spots were found in pTLV8 and pPa2 transfected wells, as shown in Fig. 2C . However, none of the fluorescent signal could be detected in pSHSP5 transfected well. When transfectant supernatants were used to infect MARC-145 cells, vTLV8 showed a subtly different IFA pattern from that of vAPRRS. However, mutant pPa2 and chimeric pSHSP5 did not develop CPE even after the fifth passage in MARC-145 cells. The IFA result showed that pPa2 developed a PRRSV-specific fluorescent signal in a few of transfected BHK-21 cells but it did not show any infection of MARC-145 cells. N-specific fluorescent signal could not detected in pSHSP5 transfected BHK-21 cells and MARC-145 cells inoculated with supernatant collected from pSHSP5 transfected BHK-21 cells, as shown in Fig. 2C . To further confirm whether pSHSP5 was infectious, we repeated the transfection experiments using BHK-21 cells three more times and transferred the transfection supernatants to MARC-145 cells for three blind passages. No typical CPE were observed in the MARC-145 cells, and no viral genomic RNA was detected in either the total intracellular RNA or the culture supernatant by RT-PCR. This result suggested that the viral rescue of pPa2 and pSHSP5 did not occur in MARC-145 cells. Therefore, the insertion of the four nucleotides ''ttaa'' in front of TRS caused inactivation of the pPa2, while ''at'' insertion between TRS and translational initiation codon of ORF1 did not affect the production of infectious progeny virus.The replacement of 5 0 UTR of type 2 with 5 0 UTR of type 1 in the context of type 2 PRRSV clone did not affect virus viability. Otherwise, the converse replacement in a context of type 1 PRRSV was lethal.",

The results in Fig. 2A showed that DNase I and RNase A could eliminate transfected input DNAs and the CMV-driven RNAs. Therefore the presence of the newly synthesized viral ( \u00c0 ) gRNA could be detected. The results of the analysis of ( \u00c0) gRNA and sg mRNA7 are shown in Fig. 2B . RT-negative controls were also performed for all of the clones. After DNase I and RNase A digestion, nothing could be detected by the RT-PCR (data not shown). The levels of RNA synthesis levels of vTLNd4 showed almost no difference from those of WT. Otherwise the level of chimeric vTLV8 was reduced compared with vAPRRS. Remarkably, the level of RNA synthesis of the mutant pPa2 showed great similarity to that of pAPRRS, although it did not develop CPE in the tested cell cultures. For pSHSP5, ( \u00c0) gRNA could also be detected, but the synthesis level was largely reduced compared with pSHE, as shown in Fig. 2B . The leader-body junction PCR was performed for identification of sg mRNA7, using four primer pairs as follows, SF12/SR15284, SFLV1/SR15284, SFLV1/SRLV14835 and SF12/SRLV14835. The sg mRNA7 transcription level of vTLV8 dropped to 50% compared with pAPRRS, Otherwise, the sg mRNA7 could not be detected in pSHSP5 transfected cells, indicated that the sg mRNA transcription was dramatically impaired. Taken together, the results indicated that 5 0 UTR of type 1 PRRSV substitution did not affect type 2 PRRSV propogation in MARC-145 cells. The Chimera pTLV8 shared almost the similar RNA synthesis level and virological characteristics with the parental type 2 PRRSV strain, vAPRRS. However, the converse chimera pSHSP5, in which 5 0 UTR of a type 1 PRRSV was substituted with counterpart of the type 2 PRRSV, was lethal. Although the (-) gRNA replication could be detected, the replication level was significantly impaired and the sg mRNA transcription was absolutely abolished. Therefore, the type 1 5 0 UTR replacement could allow maintain fully functional activities of type 2 PRRSV.",

In contrast to pTLV8, the four revertant viruses could be rescued from the first passage in MARC-145 cells using the transfection supernatants in BHK-21 cells. Subsequently, we examined genomic RNA replication and sg mRNA7 transcription levels, together with N protein expression, in transfected BHK-21 cells. The results are shown in Fig. 5 . Similar levels of sg mRNA7 transcription were found in these four revertants to those in the parental vAPRRS, but not in vTLV8. If the negative strand genomic RNA replication level of vAPRRS was set at 100%, the relative percentages for vTLV7823, vTLV8401, vTLV8914, and vTLV9433 were 60%, 83%, 71%, and 79%.

            "text": "The 5 0 UTR of many positive-stranded RNA viruses, including PRRSV, has been demonstrated to contain cis-acting elements required for viral replication and sg mRNA transcription (Liu et al., 2009 ). In equine arthritis virus (EAV) sg mRNA transcription ( Born et al., 2005) ; (Van Den Born et al., 2004) , a short, conserved leader transcription-regulating sequence (TRS-L) is located in the loop of one hairpin structure (LTH) of the 5 0 UTR and downstream body TRS (TRS-B). A similar LTH structure could be predicted for the 5 0 -proximal region of all arterivirus genomes (van Marle et al., 1999) , and also for many coronaviruses Van Den Bornet al., 2004) . It is a key element in discontinuous sg mRNA synthesis (Bornet al., 2004) . In this study, the secondary structure models for the 5 0 -proximal sequences of the two PRRSV genotypes were obtained using the energy minimization program on the Mfold web server. The 5 0 UTR of the two genotypes of PRRSV showed only 60% genetic identity. However, according to the structure model predicted by the Mfold website server and in silico analysis, their predicted secondary structure reveals a certain degree of similarity, especially in the top loop of the striking hairpin structure in which TRS is located, the counterpart of the EAV LTH. Compared with the structural models for the PRRSV and EAV 5 0 -terminal regions, we found that there were more stem-loop (SL) structural elements in the EAV 5 0 -terminus than that of PRRSV. The LTH of PRRSV was more striking than its counterpart in EAV. The single strand region of the 5 0 -proximal region of EAV is longer than that of PRRSV. The top loop of the EAV LTH, which was considered to make the leader TRS accessible as an acceptor during template switching, is larger than the top loop of PRRSV LTH. Despite the lack of identity at the level of primary sequence, the two 5 0 UTRs are high-ordered and both contained LTHs, which might be considered to be an independent RNA signal in sg mRNA synthesis. Given that thermodynamic algorithms do not show 100% accuracy in the prediction of RNA secondary structure, phylogenetic analysis remains a useful tool for the establishment of structure models. In a study of the 5 0proximal sequence of EAV, van den Born el al. used chemical and enzymatic probing to gain experimental evidence. The combined results of the chemical and enzymatic probing were in good agreement with the structure mode (Van Den Bornet al., 2004) .",

The TRS of pTLV8 was still located in the prominent top loop of LTH structure, as shown in Fig. 7A , but the TRS of pSHSP5 was no longer located in the prominent top loop structure (Fig. 7B ). pTLV8 and pSHSP5, the two chimeric mutant viruses rescue showed different results. pTLV8 was viable, while pSHSP5 was lethal. The results indicated that the secondary structure of TRS and its adjacent sequences would be very important for viral replication and infectivity. The viral properties of pTLNd4 were identical with those of the WT, while pTLV8 could be rescued during the second passage process (P2 and pPa2 could not be rescued even after five attempts of transfection and passages. The predicted secondary structure for pTLNd4 was compared with that of pPa2. The predicted top loops of pTLNd4 and pPa2, which contain the TRS are shown in detail in Fig. 1C (i) and (ii). The addition of the nucleotides ''at'' or ''ttaa'' to pTLNd4 and pPa2 had different consequences. The intermediate mutant pTLNd4 almost retained the original structure when compared with the parental pAPRRS, while the sequence ''UUAACC AUG'' in pPa2 did not fold into the prominent hairpin loop of LTH, as shown in Fig. 1C (i) and (ii). This demonstrated that the insertion of the nucleotides ''at'' between TRS and the first coden of ORF1 did not cause changes in the LTH and thus had no adverse effect on viral infection. We also produced related mutations aimed at the conserved prominent SL structure, containing insertion, deletion and substitution and demonstrated that the conserved top loop structure and its authentic primary sequence were essential for viral replication function (data not shown). Therefore, we propose that the key element in the LTH is the top loop in which TRS is located.",

It is an essential protein encoded in the genomes of all RNA-containing viruses with no DNA stage that have sense-negative RNA, it catalyzes the synthesis of the RNA strand complementary to a given RNA template. The RdRp region of PRRSV is located in Nsp9 (Fang and Snijder, 2010) , which is encoded in ORF1b. RdRp and RNA helicase (Hel; Nsp10) are important elements of the viral replication and transcription complex (RTC); the RTC mediates both genome replication and the synthesis of a discontinuous nested set of sg mRNAs. Present research has revealed that viral RdRp plays a function in the viral life cycle, tightly associated with the 5 0 UTR and 3 0 UTR. Stem-loop A (SLA) located in the Dengue virus (DENV) 5 0 UTR provides the binding site for RdRp. Viral genomic synthesis is initiated from the viral 3 0 end of the viral genome through a process of cyclization, using 5 0 binding RdRp (Filomatori et al., 2006) . It was reported an important cooperative interaction among chimeric hepatitis C/GB virus B NS5A (RdRp), 5 0 UTR, and 3 0 UTR in viral replication (Warter et al., 2009) . Such an interaction is crucial for viral RNA replication, packaging, and virion assembly in the viral life cycle. In this study, on the based of reverse genetic manipulation of heterogeneous UTR swapping in an infectious cDNA clone of type 2 PRRSV, it was found that substitution of type 1 5 0 UTR caused several revertant mutation sites to occur in the RdRp region. The chimeric pTLV8 could be recovered during the second passage process (P2), but the revertants pTLV7823, 8401, 8914, 9433 could be rescued only in P1. The results of the analysis of N protein translation level, semiquantitative RT-PCR and Northern blotting analysis showed that the level of RNA synthesis of the four mutant viruses were higher than that of vTLV8. Viral plaque assay and titration indicated that the vitality of the revertant viruses was greater than that of vTLV8. Taken together, the results show that the regulatory function is closely related to RdRp, and the heterologous 5 0 UTR with revertant RdRp played a joint role in the process of virus rescue.",

(2006) found that the three SL structures in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) 5 0 UTR could be replaced by their counterparts from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). However, the entire UTR could not be functionally substituted because of the location of the TRS (Kang et al., 2006) . The current study is the first to show that the type 1 5 0 UTR can have a regulatory function in the type 2 genomic backbone and remain fully functional. The chimeric virus vTLV8 displayed similar virologic characteristics to the WT, which implies that the substantial differences in biological properties between type 1 and type 2 PRRSV may not be due to the 5 0 UTR. In addition, we performed related research to explore the origin of the 5 0 UTR 5 0 terminal exogenous sequences, and the results showed that the insertion sequence which was used for repair was template independent (Gao et al., 2012) . We found that SL1 and SL2 of the PRRSV 5 0 UTR were important cis-acting elements in viral replication and infectivity (Gao et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011) . This study suggests that LTH, especially the top loop in which the TRS located is another cis-acing element in the life cycle of PRRSV. Taken together, the results of this study are consistent with the conclusion of our previous work (Gao et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2011) . The secondary structure elements rather than the authentic 5 0 -proximal primary sequence, are probably indispensable for PRRSV infectivity. This study provides a useful platform for further study on the structural and functional analysis of the PRRSV 5 0 UTR.",

(A) The Clustal V program was used to conduct nucleotide sequence alignment of the 5 0 UTR of PRRSV strains including 5 type 1 strains and 11 type 2 strains. Nucleotides of inter-genotypically different domains were shaded gray and nucleotides in inter-genotypically conserved domains are shaded black. The 5 0 UTR regions were designated artificially as the CS I, CS II, CS III, and CS IV domains. E and N denote type 1 and 2, respectively. SL1-5 denotes the stem-loop structures that exist in the 5 0 UTR of the two genotypes, according to Mfold. LTH was contained in SL5, see Fig. 1B for details. TRS-L was in white and black shaded. (B) The RNA secondary structures of the 5 0 -proximal region of PRRSV genomes as predicted by Mfold program with the RNAviz modification. The displayed consensus type 1 (i), consensus type 2 (ii) represent the 5 0 -proximal 280 bp and 250 bp sequences, respectively. The TRS-L is shaded gray and the ORF1 translational initiation codon is shown in a box. The prominent stem-loops in dashed frames containing the LTH structures were inter-genotypically conserved, although the primary sequence identity of the two genotypes was low. (C) Schematic representation of mutation insertions between TRS, the initiation codon of ORF1 and PRRSV 5 0 UTR. The sequences of PRRSV 5 0 UTR, 3 0 UTR, and the poly (A) tail are indicated. The mutants pTLNd4 and pPa2 were constructed from the PRRSV full length infectious cDNA clone pAPRRS using PCR-based mutagenesis. Nde I and Pac I were inserted between the TRS and the translational initiation codon of ORF1. Nucleotide sequences at the end of the 5 0 UTR are shown in uppercase and the inserted nucleotides are shown in lowercase. The translational initiation codon of ORF1 (ATG) is in bold. The chimeric clone pTLV8 was obtained by replacing type 2 5 0 UTR with type 1 5 0 UTR, while pSHSP5 was contructed by replacing type 1 5 0 UTR with type 2 counterpart, based on type 1 backbone. White bars denoted the sequence of type 2 and the hatched bar denoted the sequence of type 1. The parental pAPRRS was used as a control in all experiments. The top loops of the LTH in pTLNd4 and pPa2 were shown in (i) and (ii).",
