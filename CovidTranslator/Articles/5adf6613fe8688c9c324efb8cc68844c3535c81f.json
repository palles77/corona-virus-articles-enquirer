The clinical features of 24 enterovirus-positive patients hospitalized during 2014 differed from those of 5 enterovirus-positive children hospitalized during 2013. Hospitalization in 2014 was mostly for asthmatic crisis in children 2.5 to 7 years of age; this pattern is less clear for the few patients hospitalized in 2013 (Table) .

That these cases are virologically and clinically related to those reported in the United States documents that the virus had been introduced to the Southern Hemisphere during the spring of 2014. A substantial increase in enterovirus cases displaying a notably similar clinical pattern (asthmatic crisis in children) strongly suggests that EV-D68 infections are increasingly rapidly. This virus has been previously identified in the region (3) but only sporadically. The virus could spread to other areas in Santiago and to other cities, and similar situations could occur in other Latin American countries, especially those with many residents who travel to the United States. Public health officials need to be notified of this potential, and appropriate surveillance and treatment strategies need to be implemented.",

This species has adapted to urban areas, occupying roofs, ceilings, and other human constructions, and often coexists with other bat species and humans (2), enabling epidemiologic risks (3) . In recent studies, an alphacoronavirus has been detected in urban bat species Molossus molossus, M. rufus, and Tadarida brasiliensi in Brazil (4, 5) . Evidence suggests that alphacoronaviruses may use bats as hosts to spread human coronavirus (HCoV) NL63, which originated by evolution of Appalachian Ridge CoV strain 2 (ARCoV.2) (6).",

The sequences obtained had 87.5% (126/144) nucleotide identity with ARCoV.2, an unclassified alphacoronavirus (GenBank accession no. JX537912) for which a zoonotic role has been suggested (6). Preliminary analysis indicated good coverage of the polymerase region of the ARCoV.2 reference sequence by the reads (quality index >40) by using reference assembly against CoV complete genomes. This finding reinforces the hypothesis of this viral agent in the specimens analyzed.

The reconstruction of their evolutionary history to trace their occurrence in humans and in bat populations as well as in other animals is being conducted to clarify their evolutionary pathway.",

            "text": "To the Editor: The recent introduction of African swine fever virus (ASFV) into the European Union (http://www.oie.int/animal-health-in-the-world/the-worldanimal-health-information-system/data-after-2004-wahid/) has caused serious concern in pig industries in Europe and their trade partners. African swine fever is one of the most feared infections that can affect pig industries because no vaccine is available and the socioeconomic effect of an outbreak would be serious (1) . Therefore, early detection and coordinated countermeasures are urgently needed. For these countermeasures, information on disease dynamics and evolution is mandatory. In this respect, molecular epidemiology can be used to trace virus spread and transmission pattern.Because it is a DNA virus, ASFV evolves rather slowly, and the use of routine genome fragments (variable region of the B646L gene and parts of the E183L gene) for partial sequencing has so far shown 100% identity among strains found in Russia (2) and the neighboring countries (3) . Thus, the resolution power of these approaches is too low for in-detail analyses, which depend on information regarding larger genome fragments or whole genomes.In 2014, an insertion of a tandem repeat sequence (TRS) in the intergenic region between the I73R and the I329L protein genes was found in ASFV strains from Poland and Lithuania (3). This TRS insertion was also found in ASFV strains from Ukraine in July 2012 and from Belarus in June 2013, but not in strains from Russia, Georgia, or Azerbaijan. Gallardo et al. (3) concluded that ASFV strains in Lithuania and Poland most likely originated from Belarus. However, these authors indicated that for a full understanding of evolution and spread, additional sequence analyses would be needed, especially from regions of Russia bordering Belarus and Ukraine. We report information for 3 additional sequences from ASFV strains from Russia that were analyzed for the previously-mentioned TRS insertion on the basis of full-genome sequences.These ASFV strains originated from domestic pigs from the Tulskaya oblast (Tula06/2012), the Tverskaya oblast Kashinskiy district (Kashinskiy 09/2012), and the Tverskaya oblast (Tver06/2012) in 2012. Genome sequences were obtained by using a primer-walking method that was adapted from Portugal et al. (4) . Resulting PCR products were subjected to next-generation sequencing by using the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Raw sequence data were analyzed and assembled by using Genome Sequencer software version 2.6 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Additional sequences of the intergenic region of 17 virus isolates from domestic pigs and wild boar from Russia were obtained by using conventional PCR, and amplicons were directly sequenced by using a 3130x1 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations.Chromatograms were manually edited and assembled by using CAP3 (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/cap3.php). All nucleotide sequences of ASFV isolates obtained in this study were deposited in GenBank under accession nos. KP137625-KP137644. In the alignment, other published sequences available in GenBank from Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Russia, and Georgia were included (online Technical Appendix, http://wwwnc. cdc.gov/EID/article/21/4/14-1792-Techapp1.pdf). Sequence alignment was performed by using the ClustalW algorithm (http://www.clustal.org) as implemented in Geneious version 7.1.7 (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand).",
