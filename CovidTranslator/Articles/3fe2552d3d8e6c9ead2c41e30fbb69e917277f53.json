Ground glass opacity was the most common radiological finding on chest computed tomography. 9.6% were admitted to the ICU because of the development of organ dysfunction.

Since then all hospitals in Shanghai have opened special fever clinics to screen suspected patients, and laboratory confirmed patients were then admitted to a single designated hospital in Shanghai (Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre). Laboratory confirmation of COVID-19 was done by the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Throat-swab specimens from the upper respiratory tract were obtained from all patients at admission and maintained in viral transport medium. COVID-19 was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR using the same protocol as described previously 3 . Confirmed patients were hospitalized into negative pressure wards for further medical observation and treatment. We collected data from patients who were admitted from Jan. 20 up to Feb. 15. All the data collected from the included cases have been shared with the WHO. Data Collection. Epidemiological exposure data, patient characteristics, clinical symptoms, laboratory and imaging findings and medical history were extracted from electronic medical records and analysed by licensed physicians. Laboratory data were recorded in standardized form. Initial investigations included a complete blood count, routine urinalysis, blood gases, coagulation function, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum biochemical testing (including renal and liver function, serum lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, and electrolytes). To characterize the effect of coronavirus on the immune system, immunologic factors including serum immunoglobulin, complements, cytokines, rheumatoid factor (RF) and T cell and leukocyte subpopulations were analysed by flow cytometry.",

Compared to the previously reported duration of 7-10 days between symptom onset and hospitalization in Wuhan 3 5 6 , patients in Shanghai received earlier in-ward observation and medical service, most likely due to improved monitoring and increased awareness of the outbreak. As a result, our data likely were recorded closer to the onset date of the disease, which may explain some of the differences between the results reported from Wuhan and Shanghai.",

Almost half of the patients in Shanghai were under 50 years old, in contrast with the predominantly older patient population reported in Wuhan. In addition, 69 (34.8%) patients in our cohort had pre-existing comorbidities.

It is known that MERS-CoV is able to infect both CD4 + and CD8 + primary human T cells and, upon infection induces T cell apoptosis in vitro 7 . While the cell surface receptor for SARS-Cov-2 has now been identified as ACE2 8 , other receptors may also exist on immune cells to bind to coronavirus [9] [10] [11] . As there is no proven antiviral treatment yet available, strategies to enhance the immune system may be considered. Since the most common haematological changes in COVID-19 patients were lymphopenia and immunodeficiency, we postulate that hematopoietic growth factors such as G-CSF, by mobilizing endogenous blood stem cells and endogenous cytokines, may represent a potential haematological treatment for COVID-19 patients 12 .",

Calcium influx regulates both clathrin-mediated and clathrin-independent endocytosis during viral infection, thus constituting a key mechanism for regulation of influenza A virus internalization and infection 16 . Based on this theory, calcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, verapamil, and diltiazem, as well as BAPTA-AM, have been proven effective in inhibiting IAV replication in a dose-dependent manner in a canine kidney cell model 17 . Moreover, diltiazem may have both prophylactic and therapeutic effects in IAV treatment according to both ex vivo and in vivo testing 17 . We therefore propose the hypothesis that Ca 2+ levels and/or Ca 2+ channels may play a role in endocytosis and infection of SARS-Cov-2.

Sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples indicated a novel coronavirus, which was initially named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov), and later reclassified as SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization. Coronaviruses are known to cause multiple system infections in various animals and primarily respiratory tract infections in humans, including recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) 2 . Employing lessons learned from the SARS outbreak, extraordinary public health measures were launched to control spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Beginning on Jan 23, 2020, local governments in Hubei Province including Wuhan, Huanggang etc., announced the suspension of public transportation, with closure of airports, railway stations, and city highways, to prevent further disease transmission. Despite these extensive efforts by the Chinese government and health officials to control the outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), by January 30th, 2020, human-to-human transmission had been reported to occur outside Wuhan, extending into other regions of China and to other countries. WHO has declared that the outbreak of COVID-19 constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). As of Feb 19, 2020, 72,533 confirmed cases had been reported with a total of 1872 deaths.",

A small region of subpleural consolidation in the posterior right upper lobe. 4. Bilateral multilobular ground glass opacity and partial consolidation, and a pneumatocele in the right upper lobe. 5. Bilateral consolidation in the peripheral regions of the upper lobes, with inter-and intra-lobular septal thickening (crazy paving pattern). 6.
