To determine whether health system resources in Thailand are suffi cient to contain an emerging pandemic, we mapped health system resources in 76 provinces. We used 3 prepandemic scenarios of clustered cases and determined resource needs, availability, and gaps. We extended this analysis to a scenario of a modest pandemic and assumed that the same standards of clinical care would be required. We found that gaps exist in many resource categories, even under scenarios in which few cases occur. Such gaps are likely to be profound if a severe pandemic occurs. These gaps exist in infrastructure, personnel and materials, and surveillance capacity. Policy makers must determine whether such resource gaps can realistically be closed, ideally before a pandemic occurs. Alternatively, explicit assumptions must be made regarding allocation of scarce resources, standards of care, and priority setting during a pandemic.",

Since then, considerable international efforts have been expended, and substantial resources have been committed to controlling avian infl uenza and preparing for pandemic infl uenza (5) . Because the question is not whether a pandemic will occur but rather when (6) , policy makers have been urged to take action in preparedness planning, including making national preparedness strategies operational (5, 7, 8) . However, despite efforts to support preparedness, no universally accepted, organized method of evaluating preparedness exists, and concerns have been raised that implementation of many national strategic plans may be unrealistic (9, 10) . Several approaches have been adopted to evaluate preparedness, including assessments of national strategic plans (9, 11) , desk-top simulations (12) , full-scale fi eld exercises, case studies with site visits to assess health systems (8) , and mathematical modeling exercises (13, 14) . All have particular strengths and weaknesses. Most of these approaches, although linked to national strategic and operational plans, have not included assessments of capacity to respond (that is, of available resources at each site and the potential to mobilize these resources). Without determining capacity to respond, the feasibility of effectively and effi ciently implementing plans in a time of crisis remains highly uncertain.",

We estimate gaps in resources, given several prepandemic infl uenza scenarios. These scenarios were previously developed by policy makers and have been used extensively in tabletop exercises in most provinces throughout the country. Our aim was to determine the chal-lenges still remaining in preparing the country to effectively meet and contain the danger of an emergent pandemic. We addressed the challenge of mitigation in the event of a modest pandemic scenario, but, in agreement with national strategic policy, we assumed no diminution of standards of care or rationing of clinical services. Although the ability to maintain such levels of care is unlikely in reality, no national policies explicitly acknowledge this possibility; thus, this research draws on scenarios and assumptions currently guiding policy making.",

We developed a survey instrument to determine resources likely to be drawn upon at the province level if human-to-human spread of a novel infl uenza virus occurs. The survey instrument was developed in a stepwise manner. First, we reviewed the case notes about all human cases of avian infl uenza that have occurred in Thailand since 2004 and determined the resources used to manage the cases. Second, we conducted a literature review of resources used in managing infl uenza and SARS, and we then expanded the list of resources determined from the case notes review list. Third, we reviewed the resource list with experts in communicable disease control at national institutions and, through these discussions, modifi ed the list.",

However, if isolation beds are used, the proportion of provinces with insuffi cient resources falls to \u224875%, and if single occupancy rooms are also used, bed capacity across the country is suffi cient.

These gaps are, however, likely to occur over a limited duration if the cases occur over several weeks and the numbers of cases are limited. As the number of cases increases, however, provincial and national capacity is likely to be tested in certain ways if clinical care and surveillance are expected to remain at a similar standard as when cases are limited. The results of such a scenario are similar for some countries of western Europe (21) . Although policy makers will, in all likelihood, need to consider issues of rationing and priority setting explicitly in national strategic planning, resources in Thailand are substantial overall, although geographic distribution likely poses logistical challenges. In the event of a modest outbreak of pandemic infl uenza (WHO phase 6) similar to these locally developed scenarios, Thailand, a relatively affl uent country in Southeast Asia, might encounter relatively modest gaps in available resources. However, if a pandemic is substantial in terms of the severity of illness and proportion of deaths, resources are likely to be insuffi cient, and policy makers will have to consider whether such resource gaps can be closed in reality. This conclusion has important policy implications and raises several questions. Should most resources and planning be focused explicitly on early containment potentially at the expense of mitigation, particularly in developing countries? How, to whom, and where should the deployment of scarce resources be planned (22) ? A further issue raised is how realistic simulation exercises are and whether they effectively inform preparedness planning. Investment to address gaps in resources can be focused where the most important gaps exist. Some gaps, however, for example, in clinical and nursing staff, will take time and considerable investment to fi ll. We show at the province level where resource gaps are most profound and thus where future investment might be focused.",

This circumstance has potentially important implications for future preparedness planning. Provinces with relatively less dense populations, in which communication facilities are stretched to their limit and access to services is already likely to be problematic, may be further challenged by their relatively fewer resources (23). Focused investment in resources may be needed if the response to an emergent pandemic is to be equitable.

First, our survey focused on the narrow clinical response and ignored the capacity of management, administrative systems, fi nancial systems, and communications, capacities that are likely to be needed to effi ciently mobilize resources (24) . Second, we assumed that the relationship between resource need and case-patients is linear, and we estimated gaps on the basis of assumptions that care for case-patients as the pandemic unfolds will draw upon similarly characterized resources as in earlier phases. This assumed relationship is unlikely to occur, and care for case-patients is likely to be different from our study assumptions. However, few strategic plans explicitly acknowledge this change in resource use and thus do not plan for it (9) . Third, our scenarios, although based on tabletop exercises conducted across the country, are limited in terms of anticipated case-patients and their contacts. Even though we extended our scenario to a modest pandemic, an alternative real-life scenario under which large numbers of cases occur is likely to test the health system profoundly. Fourth, we assumed that resource sharing between provinces would be limited on the basis of an analysis of formal strategic arrangements. Fifth, some data points were missing. Although the missing data were few, and corrections were possible, some of these data were from Bangkok. In Bangkok, any determination of the city's overall resources is a challenge because of the many private autonomous healthcare facilities and their lack of systematic integration into the public health system. This factor means that our interpretation of Bangkok's capacity to respond should be considered with caution. Bangkok has 65 private hospitals with >50 beds (14,000 beds in total), and these institutions were excluded from our survey. The challenge of coordinating the city's resources in the event of a pandemic is substantial. Without an understanding of what and where those resources are, their management will be much more challenging. This lack of knowledge would have profound implications for Thailand because Bangkok is a city of 10 million persons, the economic powerhouse of the country, and a hub for transportation and communications with the rest of Thailand. The missing information also has important implications for the global control of a pandemic because of Bangkok's role as a major international transport hub.

We have shown that the health system resources available to Thailand are likely to be suffi cient to respond to emergent pandemic infl uenza if the pandemic is modest and occurs in a manner similar to the assumptions informing Thailand's simulation exercises. Other countries in the region, which is acknowledged to be at high risk for being at the epicenter of the next global pandemic of infl uenza (25) , are likely to have fewer resources than Thailand (3). We are currently investigating the capacity of Thailand and neighboring countries to respond to more profound pandemic infl uenza scenarios. Policy makers in the region may need to refl ect on where health system resources in the region might best be positioned and further expanded; what scenario assumptions are used to inform preparedness planning; whether containment, mitigation, or both, should be the focus of attention; and whether provinces with the largest probable gaps should be supported further in strengthening response capacity. Policy makers should also consider how the capacity of the private healthcare sector can, if a public health crisis occurs, be drawn upon in a timely and effective manner. In the event of a major pandemic, diffi cult decisions regarding the use of scarce resources will need to be made, and explicit planning ahead for the pandemic is advised.",
