            "text": "Objective: To describe the clinical presentation and laboratory diagnosis of pregnant women with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. Methods: Pregnant women in their second and third trimester were enrolled during the course of routine prenatal care visits when they were asymptomatic within the preceding two weeks (healthy controls) or when they reported symptoms of acute respiratory illness (ARI) of 7 days of duration (cases). Clinical outcomes were assessed at enrollment and two weeks after. Re-enrollment was allowed. Nasalpharyngeal secretions were evaluated for respiratory pathogens by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Sera were tested for RSV-specific antibody responses by Western Blot, microneutralization assay, and palivizumab competitive antibody assay. Results: During the 2015-2016 respiratory virus season, 7 of 65 (11%) pregnant women with ARI at their initial enrollment and 8 of 77 (10%) pregnant women with ARI during the study period (initial or reenrollment) had PCR-confirmed RSV infection. Four (50%) PCR-confirmed RSV ARI cases reported symptoms of a lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI), one was hospitalized. Combining PCR and serology data, the RSV attack rate at initial enrollment was 12% (8 of 65), and 13% (10 of 77) based on ARI episodes. Among healthy controls, 28 of 88 (32%) had a Western Blot profile suggestive of a recent RSV infection either in the prior and/or current season. Conclusion: RSV had an attack rate of 10-13% among ambulatory pregnant women receiving routine prenatal care during the respiratory virus season. The serology results of healthy controls suggest a potentially higher attack rate. Future studies should be aware of the combined diagnostic strength of PCR and serology to identify RSV infection. As maternal RSV vaccine candidates are evaluated to protect young infants, additional priority should be placed on outcomes of pregnant women.",

            "text": "Infection with respiratory pathogens during pregnancy can result in mild to severe acute respiratory illness (ARI). Due to the physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy, pregnant women may experience severe outcomes when infected with a respiratory pathogen [1] . Infection with influenza during pregnancy has been associated with an increased risk of maternal mortality, preterm birth, and infants that are small for gestational age [2, 3] . To prevent these adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends immunization with influenza vaccine during pregnancy [4] . The ACIP also recommends maternal immunization with the Tetanus-Diphtheria-acellular Pertussis (Tdap) vaccine [5] given that, although adult infection with pertussis is often mild, maternal antibodies transferred to the infant can prevent pertussis-related morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable age group [6] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) among infants and young children, contributing significantly to morbidity and mortality in these populations [7] [8] [9] . There is currently a robust pipeline of RSV vaccine candidates in various preclinical and clinical phases of development. One strategy targets protection of infants less than three months of age through maternal vaccination. Maternal RSV antibodies are efficiently transferred transplacentally to the fetus during gestation, and have been associated with decreased risk of RSV infection in young infants [10] [11] [12] . For this reason, maternal immunization appears to be a promising strategy to prevent severe RSV disease in infants. However, the direct benefit to pregnant women from maternal immunization against RSV is currently unknown.",

A case-series study was the first to describe severe RSV infection during pregnancy: two of the three cases were hospitalized and required mechanical ventilation [13] . In addition, several large prospective maternal cohort studies of influenza-like illness (ILI) evaluated during influenza vaccine trials have described maternal RSV infection incidences of 3.9/1000 person-years in Nepal, 5.3/1000 person-months in South Africa, and 0.3/1000 persondays in Mongolia [14] [15] [16] . Recently, a retrospective multicountry study of ARI-related hospitalizations among pregnant women identified 846 women who were tested for RSV during the influenza season, 21 (2.5%) had detectable RSV by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) [17] . Of the 21 cases, 13 had a pregnancy complication, 8 were diagnosed with pneumonia, and 6 had subsequent preterm birth. We previously described the frequency and clinical impact of respiratory viruses in women seen during the second and third trimester of pregnancy at a primary obstetrical and gynecological clinic [18] . In this manuscript we expand on the clinical and diagnostic laboratory findings of pregnant women infected with RSV.",

Taking into account one additional woman who exhibited an acute serologic RSV infection, the RSV attack rate was at least 12% (8/65) of ARI cases. An RSV attack rate as high as 13% (10/77) is estimated if calculated using the first ARI episode. This is substantial given that the RSV season in Houston was relatively mild compared to previous years [28] , and greater than reported by maternal studies of respiratory illness in Nepal and Mongolia, where RSV accounted for 2% and 2.4% of ARI cases, respectively [14, 15] . However, because fever was an inclusion criteria for those studies, and fever occurs in less than one-third of adult RSV infections, these numbers may be an underestimate [29] . Our attack rate of 12-13% is similar to that of other studies with broad ARI inclusion criteria in adults. In a four year study of ARI in high risk adults, RSV was detected in 46 of 519 (10%) cases [9] .

Both were enrolled well into their illness, at 9 and 25 days, giving them time to develop an RSV specific immunological response. This is also evident by their comparatively greater levels of neutralizing antibodies and palivizumab-like antibodies [9, 33] . Three women who were re-enrolled and had paired sera, exhibited an RSV infection profile despite negative PCR. It is likely that these women were exposed to RSV sometime between their first and second enrollment visit. Although we cannot definitively establish causality, it is possible that RSV infection was responsible for some or all of the symptoms these three women reported. Twenty-eight healthy controls had serologic evidence of a recent prior RSV infection by Western Blot testing of a single serum sample, suggesting they had been infected with RSV at sometime within the year.",

Because patients were enrolled at a single site over one RSV season, we were only able to capture eight women with PCR-confirmed RSV. However, this proportion is greater than that reported by other studies to date and, given our broad inclusion criteria, we were able to describe a range of RSV clinical manifestations. The case definition is limited in that it is dependent on self-reported symptoms, and LRTI was not confirmed by radiologic study. In addition, because serum samples were collected at the time of enrollment, only one serum sample was available for most patients, unless participants chose to re-enroll in the study at a later time. Given this, RSV case identification by serology was dependent on the number of serum samples provided: patients with sequential serum samples could be identified as having an acute serologic RSV infection, while patients with a single serum sample could be identified as having had a recent prior RSV infection.",
