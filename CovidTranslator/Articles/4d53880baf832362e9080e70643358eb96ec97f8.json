As a result of this narrow spectrum of coverage and the high cost of drug development, therapies are currently approved for fewer than ten viruses out of the hundreds known to cause human disease. This perspective summarizes progress and challenges in the development of broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. These strategies include targeting enzymatic functions shared by multiple viruses and host cell machinery by newly discovered compounds or by repurposing approved drugs. These approaches offer new practical means for developing therapeutics against existing and emerging viral threats.",

Most approved antiviral drugs target viral enzymes, most commonly proteases and polymerases. Such direct acting antivirals (DAAs) have shown considerable success in the treatment of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections. However, this approach does not scale easily and is limited particularly with respect to emerging and Re-emerging viruses against which no vaccines or antiviral therapies are approved. A major limitation of the commonly developed DAAs is their narrow spectrum of coverage, ranging from a single viral genotype to several related viruses at the most. Given an average cost of over two billion dollars and an 8-to 12-year timeline to develop a new drug (1), targeting viruses individually makes drug development expensive and slow. Moreover, given the unpredictable nature of virus emergence, this approach cannot provide adequate global health protection and national security preparedness. Finally, resistance to conventional DAAs typically emerges rapidly. This issue can be partly circumvented through combination drug treatment, but drug-drug interactions and cumulative toxicity often complicate this strategy.",

Although ribavirin was reported to benefit the resolution of many emerging viral infections preclinically (2) , it yielded marginal to no benefit in the clinic. Ribavirin is today administered together with interferon, a soluble immune factor that is active against most vertebrate-infecting viruses and that was approved for HCV treatment in 1991 (3).

One area of investigation targets host factors involved in regulating intracellular viral trafficking. For example, the host kinases cyclin G associated kinase (GAK) and AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) regulate viral trafficking during entry, assembly, and release of unrelated viruses (9) . The approved anticancer drugs erlotinib and sunitinib potently inhibit GAK and AAK1, respectively, and show in vitro activity against HCV (9), several flaviviruses, Ebola virus, and HIV. The combination of erlotinib and sunitinib protects mice from lethal dengue and Ebola virus challenges and is being advanced into clinical trials for dengue and Ebola. The kinase inhibitors dasatinib, imatinib, and nilotinib are additional approved anticancer drugs with broad antiviral activity (10, 11) . Another drug that may be repurposed is nitazoxanide, FDAapproved for the treatment of parasitic diarrhea. It inhibits replication of respiratory viruses, HIV, HCV, flaviviruses, and other viruses and has reduced the duration of flu symptoms in clinical studies (12) . Nitazoxanide blocks maturation of the influenza hemagglutinin, but the target remains unknown. Further approved drugs whose therapeutic potential against emerging viruses is being evaluated include chloroquine, an antimalarial agent (13) , and atorvastatin, which alters host lipid metabolism (14) .",

Cellular proteins function in a complex network of interactions, and a complete understanding of the drug's mechanism of action is often elusive. Moreover, an achieved in-vitro phenotype often does not translate into an in-vivo outcome. Toxicity is another major concern. Nevertheless, it may be feasible to identify a therapeutic window where the drug level is sufficient to inhibit viral replication with minimal cellular toxicity. Furthermore, shifting from an indication requiring long-term therapy (e.g. months to years for cancer) to a shorter duration sufficient to treat most acute viral infections can help limit toxicity. Emergence of resistance typical of DAA monotherapy can also complicate treatment with host-targeted approaches, as in the case of the CCR5 antagonist maraviroc (15) . Nevertheless, the time to resistance with other hosttargeted approaches appears longer and the level of resistance lower than with DAAs, as exemplified by treatment with cyclophilin inhibitors (7).",
