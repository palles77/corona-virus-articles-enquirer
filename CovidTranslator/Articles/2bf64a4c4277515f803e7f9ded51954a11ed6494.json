Practical information was (and continues to be) included in the algorithms, which have in general been well received. However, to reinforce this information, the HPA worked with the Royal College of General Practitioners to prepare some specifi c practical guidance on management of patients with swineorigin infl uenza, on April 30, which was cascaded to general practitioners and was immediately published on the HPA website. This practical guidance is very clear on what action needs to be taken and how to access antivirals, as well as providing a full list (with contact details) of all Health Protection Units across England in addition to that already available on the HPA website.",

With reference to your Editorial \"Preempting a pandemic-fact or fi ction?\", 1 we feel that we ought to mention the unprecedented preparation in the UK over the past few years-a collaboration between the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and the UK Clinical Virology Network (UKCVN)-to ensure the provision of a wide range of molecular-based assays for the rapid diagnosis and typing of infl uenza A and B infections. The UKCVN is a federation of laboratories in the UK and Ireland that share reagents, in-house assay protocols, and best practice in addition to being a medical and public educational resource. Updates of assays that detect H5N1 avian infl uenza, swine-lineage infl uenza A (H1N1), and seasonal infl uenza A strains had been rolled out by the HPA Centre for Infections Virus Reference Laboratory to HPA regional laboratories. After the concerns surrounding the potential for an avian infl uenza H5N1 pandemic, UKCVN specialist virology centres in the UK and Ireland have been running these assays regularly to ensure out-of-hours availability in an emergency situation.",
