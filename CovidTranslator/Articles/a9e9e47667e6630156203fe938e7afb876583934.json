The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus spike protein (SARS-CoV S) can be primed by a variety of host cell proteases, with proteolytic cleavage occurring both as the S1/S2 boundary and adjacent to a fusion peptide in the S2 domain. Here, we studied the priming of SARS-CoV S by elastase and show an important role for residue Thr 795 in the S2 domain. A series of alanine mutants were generated in the vicinity of the S2 cleavage site, with the goal of examining elastase-mediated cleavage within S2. Both proteolytic cleavage and fusion activation were modulated by altering the cleavage site position. We propose a novel mechanism whereby SARS-CoV fusion protein function can be controlled by spatial regulation of the proteolytic priming site, with important implications for viral pathogenesis.",

These wild type and T795D pseudovirions infected cells via the endosomal routes at comparable levels, and this route of infection was efficiently blocked by neutralizing endosomal acidification with NH 4 Cl (see Fig. 2 ). Although the cell surface-bound wild type S pseudovirions could be induced to enter cells after treatment with elastase-1, entry was severely limited in the case of the T795D mutant pseudovirions ( Fig. 2A) .

However, this elastase cleavage event truncates the critical glycine that comprises the N terminus of the fusion peptide, and so renders HA nonfunctional for fusion. In contrast, the coronavirus S2\u0408 fusion peptide appears to be composed of a small helical loop that is physically separated from the cleavage site itself (11, 19) . This organization may allow the possibility of modulating fusion peptide function by shifting the relative position of the core fusion peptide residues relative to the site of cleavage, a scenario that is generally consistent with our data.

In contrast to the situation with elastase-1, our initial studies with neutrophil elastase failed to give any consistent activation of SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion (data not shown). Neutrophil elastase (elastase-2) has a less specific MEROPS consensus cleavage site of \u03ea/\u03ea/\u03ea/VIAT2\u03ea/\u03ea/\u03ea/\u03ea (compared with A/\u03ea/P/AV2\u03ea/ \u03ea/\u03ea/\u03ea for elastase-1), and so the reasons behind the lack of activation by elastase-2 are unclear at present. We are currently exploring the use of elastase-2 and elastases produced by opportunistic bacteria in more detail, to define the relevance of elastase activation for viral pathogenesis. The novel mechanism for modulation of fusion protein function shown here, shifting the cleavage site position relative to the core residues of the fusion peptide, indicates that this may be a significant factor in disease outcome or in the ability of coronaviruses to undergo host range changes.",
