The optimal pH and temperature of the 3C-like protease for the proteolytic activity were 8.6 and 37 \u2022 C, respectively. Increased concentration (\u223c100 mM) of monovalent cations such as Na + and K + was inhibitory to the activity. Hg 2+ and Zn 2+ remarkably inhibited the protease activity, while Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ had no virtual effect. Several sulfhydryl reagents such as p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, methyl methanethiosulfonate, N-ethylmaleimide and N-phenylmaleimide also blocked the activity, confirming the previous result that cysteine residue(s) were responsible for the proteolysis.",

The 3C and 3C-like proteases belonging to the chymotrypsin-like protease superfamily are found in several animal, insect, and plant virus families such as Picornaviridae, Comoviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridaee, and Arteriviridae (Dougherty and Semler, 1993; Gorbalenya et al., 1989) . Their three-dimensional structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography in poliovirus , rhinovirus (Matthews et al., 1994) , hepatitis A virus (Bergmann et al., 1997) , and coronavirus (Anand et al., 2002 Yang et al., 2003) , tobacco etch virus (Phan et al., 2002) and equine arteritis virus (Barrette-Ng et al., 2002) . These studies allowed us to identify the active-site amino acid residues with a combination of site-directed mutagenesis studies (Boniotti et al., 1994; Cheah et al., 1990; Gosert et al., 1997; Hammerle et al., 1991) . Several 3C and 3C-like proteases were purified and their biochemical properties were well characterized (Baum et al., 1991; Chisholm et al., 2001; Davis et al., 1997; Ziebuhr et al., 1997) . They are characterized by their proteolytic activities being inhibited by both cysteine and serine protease inhibitors. As a result of these studies, therapeutic drugs, especially for rhinovirus, are being developed (Hammerle et al., 1991; McKinlay, 2001; Turner, 2001) .",

Norovirus cannot be propagated in cell cultures, and animal models have not been developed, which hampers the progress of biochemical and molecular biological studies of Norovirus. We cloned and sequenced the whole genome of a Chiba strain of Norovirus (Chiba virus), and its 3C-like protease has been heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli in an active form (Someya et al., 2000) . Furthermore, we identified the active-site amino acid residues and concluded that Norovirus 3C-like protease had a catalytic dyad consisting of His30 and Cys139 (Someya et al., 2002) . This is a unique feature since most of the 3C and 3C-like proteases have a catalytic triad consisting of His, Asp/Glu, and Cys/Ser, similar to chymotrypsin (Dougherty and Semler, 1993; Gorbalenya et al., 1989 shown that the active site of Coronavirus 3C-like protease was also composed of two residues, His and Cys (Anand et al., 2002) .",

The resultant supernatant was mixed with TALON Metal Affinity Resin (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl. The resin was washed with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.1 M imidazole for removal of non-specifically bound proteins. The proteins of interest were eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer containing 0.1 M NaCl and 0.5 M imidazole and concentrated using Ultrafree-15 unit with Biomax-10 membrane (MILLIPORE, Bedford, MA). Proteins were determined by the method of Bradford (Bradford, 1976 ).",

In order to purify the Chiba virus 3C-like protease, we constructed pT7ProHis with the gene fragment encoding the protease with His-tag in its C-terminus (Fig. 1B) . The ProHis protein (calculated molecular mass of 20.6 kDa) expressed from pT7ProHis was used as an enzyme in this study. In order to observe proteolysis at the cleavage site between the 3C and 3D, we at first used the His-3CD-C139A mutant protein expressed from pT7His3CD-C139A as a substrate, which was the N-terminal His-tagged 3CD fragment containing the Ala mutation of active-site Cys139 of the 3C-like protease (Fig. 1B) . However, this protein tended to aggregate at higher pH after prolonged incubation. Other parts from the native Chiba virus ORF1 polyprotein could not be effectively produced in E. coli cells. Therefore, the His3Cd-GST protein (calculated molecular mass of 48.0 kDa) was used as a substrate, which retains the cleavage site between the 3C and 3D. The region covering the entire 3C and the N-terminal 19 amino acids of 3D was placed under the control of T7 promoter with the N-terminal His-tag and the C-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST), the resultant plasmid being designated pT7His3Cd-GST (Fig. 1B) . Although this protein itself has the 3C-like protease moiety, it never undergoes autocatalytic cleavage because the C139A mutation is introduced. If His3Cd-GST is cleaved at the 3C/3D junction (LE/GG) by the active ProHis, the His3C-C139A moiety of 20.7 kDa and the 3D -GST moiety of 27.3 kDa are produced. Enzymatic reaction was initiated by mixing enzyme (ProHis) and substrate (His3Cd-GST). We could not obtain clear results when the reaction was performed in a short period (2-4 h) (data not shown). However, even if a substrate was mixed with an enzyme for a long period (more than 24 h), complete cleavage could not be achieved. One possibility for the incomplete cleavage is that the cleavage site of the substrate (His3Cd-GST) could not be accessible by the protease because the substrate was not properly folded. Alternatively, part of the cleavage site in the substrate might be masked by its own catalytic site or the catalytic site of other substrate molecule, so that the enzyme might have competed with the substrate for the cleavage site.",

With the addition of 5 mM MnCl 2 , part of the proteins used for reaction appeared to be aggregated since Coomassiestained materials stayed in the well (Fig. 4B ).

These proteases should therefore be sensitive to sulfhydryl reagents. In fact, as shown in Fig. 4B , high concentrations (5 mM) of Hg 2+ and Zn 2+ blocked the activity of the 3C-like protease. In Fig. 5 , the effects of several sulfhydryl reagents were tested. Five micromolar substrate was reacted with 5 M enzyme in the presence of 10 M sulfhydryl reagents. Ten micromolar Hg 2+ or Zn 2+ almost completely in- hibited the activity. p-Chloromercuribenzoate (PCMB), which includes an Hg(II) within the molecule, was also a good inhibitor of the 3C-like protease (82% inhibition). In contrast, p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonate (PCMBS) slightly inhibited the activity (27% inhibition), despite PCMBS also having an Hg(II) similarly to PCMB. Methyl methanethiosulfonate (MMTS), N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and N-phenylmaleimide (NPM), which form a covalent bond with a sulfur atom of the cysteine residue, almost completely inhibited the activity. The reaction with NEM and NPM slightly altered the mobility of the enzyme molecules, possibly because a bulkier modified side chain of the active-site cysteine residue affected the structure of the enzyme, or because more than one molecule of the inhibitors attached to an enzyme. Neither 10 M iodoacetate (IAA) nor iodoacetamide (IAM) inhibited the activity. These two reagents may be less sensitive to an SH group than other modifying reagents. Phenyl methylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) is well known as an irreversible inhibitor of serine proteases. Because the 3C and 3C-like proteases have a structural architecture similar to chymotrypsin, and with essentially the same proteolysis mechanism (Dougherty and Semler, 1993; Gorbalenya et al., 1989) , PMSF may inhibit the activity of the 3C and 3C-like proteases. Ten micromolar PMSF was less effective but significantly inhibited the activity of the Chiba virus 3C-like protease (20% inhibition). The effect of \u2424-mercaptoethanol (\u2424-ME) was also examined here. The residual activity of the 3C-like protease was approximately 80% of the control in the presence of 10 M \u2424-ME (Fig. 5) . Even in the presence of much higher concentrations (5 mM) of \u2424-ME, approximately 60% activity remained (data not shown). These results suggest that a disulfide bond is not essential to the activity. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that a disulfide bond is buried inside the folded protein and cannot be reduced by high concentrations of \u2424-ME.",

In addition, high concentrations of K + , which is abundant inside the cell in a normal state, were also inhibitory to the activity (data not shown). The presence of Mg 2+ or Ca 2+ did not affect the activity at all (Fig. 4B) . These features might suggest that the 3C-like protease is localized and works in a limited environment inside the infected cells, rather than spreading throughout the cells. More information is necessary to elucidate when and where the 3C-like protease does work in the infected cell. We have previously shown that the active site of the Chiba virus 3C-like protease is composed of Cys139 and His30 (Someya et al., 2002) .

Small (Hg 2+ , Zn 2+ , and MMTS) and hydrophobic (NEM and NPM) reagents tended to inhibit the activity more strongly than hydrophilic reagents (PCMB and PCMBS) (Fig. 5) .
