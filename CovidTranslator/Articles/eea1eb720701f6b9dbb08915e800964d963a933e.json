Studies have confirmed that duration of hospital stay is regarded as an indicator of efficiency. [1] [2] [3] [4] For low dependency inpatients, a long hospital stay may imply ineffective treatment, which increases healthcare expenditure. Theoretically, reducing duration of stay may increase the capacity of available hospital beds and the admissions of new inpatients. However, quick discharge may also generate problems such as additional demands on professionals (doctors and nurses) as well as a heavier workload for follow-up specialist outpatient care, pressure on other healthcare sectors like nursing homes, and a risk of rapid readmission. Thus, the challenges of controlling healthcare expenditure and reducing",

Because disease patterns differ for each age group, the potential reduction in hospitalisation will also differ for each group. 5 Hospitalisation costs are a major component of healthcare expenditure in Hong Kong, which has a population of 7.0 million. Healthcare expenditure has been increasing, accounting for 25% of government expenditure, a relatively high percentage compared with other countries. 6 About 80% of inpatients attend public hospitals, which are managed by the Hospital Authority. 7 The public healthcare sector currently accounts for over 90% of total secondary and tertiary care, and receives a government subsidy of 95%. The public pay HK$100 (US$13) per day for inpatient services, although the average operating cost per hospital bed is approximately HK$3300 (US$350) a day. Furthermore, Hong Kong is facing an acute ageing problem: 14% of older adults were aged 65 or over in 2012, a figure projected to increase to over 33% by 2041, which will have a significant impact on health and medical services. [8] [9] [10] [11] In this study we aim to investigate the factors leading to a reduction in total hospitalisation days which has had a direct impact on healthcare costs. According to the latest report from the Hospital Authority, despite a rise in population from 6.7 to 7.0 million and an increase in patient numbers from 583 000 to 664 000 during the period 2000-2010, there has been a significant reduction in the total number of hospitalisation days in Hong Kong. Total hospitalisation days are calculated from the number of inpatients per 1000 population, the number of visits per patient, and the mean duration of stay per visit. The increases in population size, patient population and number of visits per patient in a given year have been offset by improved management of patients, with a reduction in the mean duration of stay per visit, resulting in a 30% decrease in the number of hospitalisation days from 2001 to 2010. In the present study, we use a decomposition method to examine and quantify the impact of the mean duration of stay per visit on the other two factors, hospitalisation rate per 1000 population and the number of visits per patient, in relation to its impact on the total number of hospitalisation days.",

The census statistics include sex and age for the entire population. The Hospital Authority provides episode-based hospitalisation data which contain information on age, gender, hospital, date of birth, district of residence, dates of admission and discharge, disease code, duration of stay for each visit, and discharge destination. However, as a significant proportion of the patient data have missing disease codes, we will not examine the disease-code specific duration of stay in this analysis. Although the capacity of the Hong Kong hospital system has varied over the years, the overall occupancy rate is about 90% on average. The hospital service model in Hong Kong remained relatively unchanged during the study period. It is also assumed that the range of clinical services and patient case mix in the public hospital system remained constant over the 11-year period.",

Good quality of care and an efficient healthcare system are both essential. Shortening the duration of hospital stay may be consistent with an orderly and systematic care pathway, but a longer duration of stay may be appropriate for extended treatment. As Clarke states, \"The problematic nature of the relationship between LOS [length of stay] and quality needs to be acknowledged\". 17 Our results show that the mean duration of stay plays a significant role in determining the number of hospitalisation days against an overall hospital occupancy of 90%. The number of visits per patient increased from 1.98 to 2.14, and the hospitalisation rate increased from 87.43 to 94.51 ( possibly due to the ageing of the population). However, the reduction in the mean duration of stay from 6.83 to 4.58 days contributed to the 21% reduction in the number of hospitalisation days per person. The reduction in duration of hospital stay may also have reduced the risk of cross-infection, especially among older adults and immune-compromised patients. Hence, even a shorter mean duration of stay per visit, which may be associated with an increase in the number of re-visits, still results in a reduction in the total number of hospitalisation days. The number of people with chronic illness increased by more than 4% each year, which is higher than the anticipated increase in funding for the Hong Kong medical and health services and the growth in GDP. 18 Hong Kong has one of the longest life expectancies in the world (81 years for males and 86 years for females), so people are living longer, but they are not necessarily healthier. 10 19 The rise in hospitalisation is also driven by the continuing increase in demand for medical and health services, improved medical technologies and enhanced public expectations. A focused management system controlling duration of hospital stay is important for attaining service efficiency and containing the increase in healthcare expenditure. Possible poor patient satisfaction, arising from shorter stays, has not been considered in the current assessment. However, studies in The Netherlands suggest no correlation between shorter duration of stay and patient satisfaction, except in pulmonology. 20 Also, the patient satisfaction level in Hong Kong remains high at around 80%, and shorter stays do not seem to be correlated with patient satisfaction. 21 However, the increased workload for medical and health staff as a result of shorter stays has not been properly measured or reflected in cost considerations.",

Second, we assume the workload for medical and health workers per hospitalisation day is the same for every patient, which is unlikely. It has been reported that the introduction of day surgery, as opposed to admitting the patient the previous day, has resulted in an excessive workload for medical and healthcare workers. Therefore, a simple count of the number of hospitalisation days might not properly reflect the additional work arising from the reduction in the mean duration of stay per visit. Although possible change in the case mix has not been considered in examining the reduction in hospitalisation days, the lack of any significant change in the morbidity and mortality pattern in Hong Kong during the period indicates any variation in case mix is expected to be limited. Furthermore, systems monitoring the complicated relationship among shortened duration of stay, the capacity of public hospitals and the quality of care (in terms of patient safety and satisfaction) in the public hospital system in Hong Kong need to be formulated carefully.
