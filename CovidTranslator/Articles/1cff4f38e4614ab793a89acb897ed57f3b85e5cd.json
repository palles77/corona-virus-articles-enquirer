Therefore, association of CR88 (793B type) with H120 vaccines was used for better response. Challenge experiments were then conducted to evaluate tracheal and renal crossprotection in chickens immunized via nasal and eye drops. Conferred protection was measured by clinical signs and macroscopic lesions observed, based on scores attributed according to their severities. The results showed a low protection conferred by H120 alone, as vaccination did not reduce tracheal and kidney lesions (70% scored as 3) after TN20/00 virus challenge, which also led to 10% mortality. Conversely, the challenge results indicated that the combination of the 2 strains (H120/CR88) allow high protection. Based on the results of the challenge experiments, a vaccination protocol coupling CR88 to H120 was applied for industrial broiler flocks. Clinical observations and serological results confirmed that association of heterologous serotypes (H120 and CR88 vaccines) increased the levels of protection against infectious bronchitis viruses compared with the H120 vaccine given alone.",

Modern intensive poultry production practices in Tunisia have contributed to the presence of new IBV variants, which can evade the immune response induced by the commercial H120 vaccine, the only vaccine in use in the country [10] , as multiple IBV serotypes are recognized worldwide [11, 12] . Previous studies in Tunisia indicated that these field IBV variants arise from recombination, insertions, deletions, and point mutation events, especially in the S1 gene (spike glycoprotein gene) resulting in the generation of 5 Tunisian IBV variants TN20/00, TN200/01, TN335/01, TN296/07, and TN556/07 [13, 14] . Pathogenicity testing was important and showed that these field isolates produced typical lesions in the respiratory tract and severe damages in the kidney of infected birds. The TN20/00 variant was identified as a nephropathogenic IBV, not related to the Massachusetts serotype and showing higher pathogenicity [10] . Serological and molecular studies confirmed that the Tunisian IB variant viruses isolated from vaccinated chicken flocks are genetically different from the vaccine in use [14] . In a sero-surveillance survey in vaccinated flocks, low levels of antibodies were found, indicating vaccination failures; 45 to 69% of the flocks showed positive levels of antibodies and only 5 to 15% of these were protected [10] . In general, vaccination fails and incidence of IB outbreaks are highly associated to the vaccination process of each country, independent of the virus strain [15] . In fact, the type of virus strain infecting a flock determines the pathogenesis of the disease and the outcome of the infection is closely dependent on the immune status of the host [4, 16, 17] .",

For these reasons, assessing antigenic relationships among field and vaccine IBV strains must be accomplished by standard methods that mainly include laboratory cross-challenge studies in chickens. In the current study, protection conferred by the H120 vaccine (Massachusetts group) against the Tunisian TN20/00 variant was evaluated. In addition, the protection offered by the vaccine was compared with the protection provided by the CR88 variant vaccine (793B type) alone or in association with the H120 vaccine, under laboratory conditions. In addition, a field study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccination protocol based on the administration of H120 vaccine at 1 d followed by a second vaccination with the CR88 strain at 14 d old. The antigenic relatedness between the CR88 and the TN20/00 serotypes in addition to their renal tropism were the main factors for using the CR88 vaccine strain in the current study. Bouroga\u00e2 et al. [14] demonstrated by phylogenetic studies that the CR88 vaccine was closely related to the Tunisian field variants, especially the TN20/00 variant.",

At 28 d of age, Ab titers were low in all groups (Table 2) . For all vaccinated groups, the Ab titers detected after challenge at 40 d of age of surviving birds ranged between 367 and 1,401. Group 2, double vaccinated with H120 at 1 and 14 d of age, showed the highest Ab level (1,401), which was generally expected because we used the same vaccine strain as booster. Very low ElISA titers were seen for the control groups 6 and 7 (unvaccinated-challenged and unvaccinated-unchallenged, respectively). The ElISA results indicated that the titers at 40 d of age are very low and similar among challenged and unchallenged chickens (except birds in group 2); this result suggests that serum Ab titers do not always correlate well with the presence or the lack of homologous or heterologous protection, because local Ab responses and cell-mediated immunity play a significant role in the total protection against IBV infections, as mentioned by other researchers [25] [26] [27] .",

Among the challenged groups, no mortality was observed in group 1 (vaccinated with H120 and CR88) and percentages of mortality were 10% in group 2 (double vaccinated with H120), 10% in group 3 (vaccinated with H120), and 20% in group 4 (vaccinated with CR88). The unvaccinated-challenged chicken (group 6) showed 50% mortality. Comparison of mortality between vaccinatedchallenged group (group 1) and unvaccinatedchallenged group (group 6) showed significant differences (P < 0.05). The TN20/00 challenge induced high mortality and a decrease in growth in challenged birds, indicating that the challenge virus was highly pathogenic for the level of immunity induced by the vaccines, as reported by Yunis et al. [28] . Conversely, the mortality and the severity of the lesions were influenced not only by the challenge strain, but also by the age of the chicken and the route of vaccination [15, 17, [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

Whereas the results indicated good protection against challenge with TN20/00 when the CR88 variant vaccine was administered at 14 d of age to chickens vaccinated with H120 at d 1 (group 1). low clinical signs and lesion scores were observed in birds from group 1 as compared with those of groups 2, 3, 4, and 6 (P < 0.05). However, the presence of severe damages in birds double vaccinated with H120 (group 2), with no significant difference compared with that afforded by H120 vaccination at d 1 (group 3), denotes a lack of complete protection in these groups; however, improvement in the level of protection was noted when comparing these findings to those observed in birds vaccinated with only CR88 at 14 d old (group 4). The renal lesions observed in dead birds of groups 4 and 6 (60 and 80% scored as 3, respectively) were expected because of the renal tro-pism of the coronaviruses CR88 and TN20/00, in addition to their respiratory tropism described in previous studies [10, 33] .",

In fact, the resulting cross-protection induced higher levels of Ab associated with increased WG (71 g of BW in the assay flocks, B2, B3, and B4, compared with the control flock, B1) and good performance during the fattening period, including (1) no severe clinical signs in all the tested flocks throughout the study, (2) a decreased average of mortality, from 6 to 4.5%, between control B1receiving only H120 vaccine and tested flocks (B2, B3, and B4) receiving both vaccines (H120 and CR88), respectively ( Table 4 ). The levels of Ab against IBV in each flock (20 samples per flock), presented as GMT (Table 5 ), indicated that all chickens had maternally derived Ab against IBV H120 at 1 d old (GMT titers ranged from 4,559 to 7,412). At 10 d of age, birds in all flocks showed decreasing levels of Ab. At 38 d of age the control flock (B1) showed 1,067 GMT titer, whereas birds vaccinated with H120 and boosted with CR88 (B2, B3, and B4) showed Ab levels ranging from 1,870 to 4,028 (average GMT titer was 2,692 for these flocks). Consequently, chickens receiving both vaccines produced higher Ab titers than birds of the control group. However, the variation between flocks receiving the same treatment indicated the heterogeneity of the immune response among birds of each flock (CV >50%). Based on the results of the present study and the challenge experiment results reported by others [9, 16, 24, 34] , an adapted program using heterologous vaccines H120 and CR88 at 1 and 10 d of age, respectively, has given better results.",
