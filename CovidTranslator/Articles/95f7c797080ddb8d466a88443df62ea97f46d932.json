Here, we present the first generation of the chimeric cytoplasmic cappingprone phage polymerase (C3P3-G1) expression system developed by biological engineering, which generates capped and polyadenylated transcripts in host-cell cytoplasm by means of two components. First, an artificial single-unit chimeric enzyme made by fusing an mRNA capping enzyme and a DNAdependent RNA polymerase. Second, specific DNA templates designed to operate with the C3P3-G1 enzyme, which encode for the transcripts and their artificial polyadenylation. This system, which can potentially be adapted to any in cellulo or in vivo eukaryotic expression applications, was optimized for transient expression in mammalian cells. C3P3-G1 shows promising results for protein production in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells. This work also provides avenues for enhancing the performances for next generation C3P3 systems.",

            "text": "Despite their broad uses in life sciences, transient expression by plasmid-based expression systems has significant drawbacks. First, the transfer of plasmid DNA from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is a rate-limiting process in nondividing cells. This limits efficient plasmid-based expression systems to dividing cells, in which this barrier is overcome by temporary disassembly of the nuclear membrane during mitosis (1, 2) . Such limited transfer to the nucleus of exogenous DNA in quiescent cells is a potential drawback for the efficacy of non-viral gene therapy and DNA vaccination. Second, plasmid-based expression depends on host cell nuclear RNA polymerase II (polII), a moderately processive enzyme with a rate of elongation of 25 and 6 nucleotides/second in vitro and in cellulo, respectively (3, 4) . Third, standard plasmid-based eukaryotic expression exploits the host cell transcriptional machinery and thereby competes with the host cell genome for transgene expression (4) . Together, these challenges are thought to limit the efficacy of the standard eukaryotic expression systems.",

All pCMV-C3P3-G1 plasmids and derivatives had the same design: IE1 promoter/enhancer from the human cytomegalovirus (CMV), 5 -untranslated region (5 -UTR), Kozak consensus sequence followed by the ORFs of the C3P3-G1 enzymes, 3 -untranslated region , and SV40 polyadenylation signal. Substitution of the coding sequence components from the C3P3-G1 enzymes was enabled by digestion at endonuclease restriction enzyme sites of six nucleotides located between each domain of the coding sequences of the C3P3-G1 enzyme (i.e. NH 2 terminus, upstream and downstream to the linker) and eight nucleotides immediately downstream to stop codon. The C3P3-G1 enzyme plasmids are identified by the different modules in the ORF of the C3P3-G1 enzyme downstream to the IE1 human CMV promoter/enhancer.

Transfected cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature, then washed with 50 mM glycine solution in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized for 10 min in 0.1% Triton X-100. Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 for 15 min, mounted in the anti-fade Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories), and imaged by direct fluorescence as described above.",

This elegant expression system relies on infection of mammalian cells by a recombinant vaccinia virus encoding T7RNAP, which transcribes target genes under control of the T7-promoter embedded in a second recombinant vaccinia virus or plasmid. The transcripts produced by this system can receive 5'-cap and 3'-polyadenylation by the vaccinia virus capping and polyadenylation machineries, respectively (30) . Although this expression system is able to generate up to 30% of the total cytoplasmic RNA, only 5-10% of the T7-transcripts are capped and 25% of them are polyadenylated, which suggests insufficient synergy between the transcriptional and post-transcriptional machineries (30, 31) .",

The vaccinia virus capping enzyme consists of a 97and a 33-kDa subunit that are encoded by the vaccinia virus-D1R and D12L genes respectively (32) . The D1R product has enzymatic activities (33) (34) (35) , whereas the D12L product acts as its allosteric regulator (36) . Both D1R and D12L were cloned into independent plasmids and cotransfected into HEK-293 cells in combination with pCMV-T7RNAP and pT710-Luciferase plasmids. Luciferase expression was increased by 9-fold in cells co-transfected with D1R and D12L plasmids in comparison to T7RNAP plasmid alone, which confirmed the importance of capping for T7-transcripts translational efficiency ( Figure 2 ).",

            "text": "In Nature, eukaryotic RNAPs are commonly coupled with their corresponding capping enzymes, which is likely required for selective capping of transcripts. In contrast, the absence of coupling between the T7RNAP and capping enzyme of the hybrid vaccinia virus-T7RNAP expression system possibly accounts for the poor capping rate of T7transcripts (30) . Hence, we chose to increase the proximity of T7RNAP and vaccinia virus capping enzyme by directly coupling these enzymes together. This approach therefore differs from the strategy used by others (37) (38) (39) , in which nuclear-directed-T7RNAP was fused with the carboxyl terminal domain from POLR2A (40) , which interacts with the host-cell nuclear capping enzyme (41) . Although this fusion was sought to bring these enzymes together, it generates neither capped nor spliced transcripts but instead promotes formation of DNA:RNA hybrids (37, 38) . T7RNAP and vaccinia virus capping enzyme were coupled using EE 1234 L and RR 1234 L leucine-zippers. These amphipathic \u2423-helices form an antiparallel heterodimer with binding affinity of \u223c10 \u221215 M (42). RR 1234 L was fused inframe to the amino-terminal ends of either D1R or D12L vaccinia virus capping enzyme subunits, while EE 1234 L was fused in-frame to the amino-terminal end of T7RNAP. Two heterotrimeric enzymes were therefore generated by co-transfection: EE 1234 L-T7RNAP that binds to RR 1234 L-D1R and D12L duplex, as well as EE 1234 L-T7RNAP that binds to RR 1234 L-D12L and D1R duplex. The constructs were transfected in HEK-293 cells and assayed for luciferase expression. In comparison to uncoupled enzymes, leucinezippers on D1R or D12L increased luciferase expression by 7.6-and 5.1-fold respectively ( Figure 2) .",

For five of these capping enzymes, at least one of these three enzymatic activities were also previously confirmed biochemically (Bluetongue virus VP4 (44) (45) (46) , Mimivirus R382 (47), ASFV NP868R (48), ORF3 from the yeast cytoplasmic episome pGKL2 (49, 50) , Bamboo Mosaic virus ORF1 (51, 52) ). The remaining four capping enzymes were selected based on having >20% amino-acid identity with NP868R and all three enzymatic capping domains inferred by electronic annotation. The activity of each single-subunit C3P3-G1 enzyme was tested following co-transfection with pT710-Luciferase reporter plasmid (25) . High expression was obtained with NP868R-(G 4 S) 4 -T7RNAP and to a lesser extent R382-(G 4 S) 4 -T7RNAP, relative to T7RNAP alone ( Figure 3C ). Coupling of NP868R with T7RNAP by leucine-zippers also increased luciferase expression in comparison to uncoupled enzymes (Supplementary Figure S3) . Similar results were obtained when the T7RNAP was substituted by T3 or SP6RNAP (Supplementary Figure S4) . Both NP868R-(G 4 S) 4 -T7RNAP and R382-(G 4 S) 4 -T7RNAP were also active, albeit at reduced efficiency, when the 10 promoter was substituted by the low-activity 2.5 promoter that initiates transcription with an adenosine (53) (Supplementary Figure S5) . Together, these results show that ASFV NP868R can significantly enhance protein expression when coupled to various phage RNAPs.",

This RNA element is involved in the regulation of stability and of translation efficiency in the cytoplasm and is functionally similar to a poly(A) tail in that it enhances translational efficiency and is dependent on mRNA capping. The corresponding pK1E-Luciferase with various sequence modifications were co-transfected with the pCMV-NP868R-(G 4 S) 2 To confirm the requirement of NP868R capping activity, the K282N mutation was introduced into the NP868R moiety of NP868R-(G 4 S) 4 -T7RNAP, which is predicted to suppress GTase activity by blocking NP868R-GMP adduct formation and thereby the transfer of GMP to 5 -diphosphate ends of mRNA (54) . As anticipated, the K282N mutation drastically impaired luciferase expression by C3P3-G1 (Supplementary Figure S7) .",

Since capping by C3P3 dramatically increased translation of T7p-derived mRNAs, we reasoned that if mR-NAs remained uncapped by C3P3, then supplementation with auxiliary NP868R enzyme should further increase translation over C3P3 alone. To direct auxiliary NP868R to luciferase reporter mRNAs, we fused NP868R to the N peptide of -phage which binds boxB RNA hairpins at nanomolar affinity (7), and added four BoxBr hairpins to the 3 UTR of the firefly luciferase gene ( Figure 4 ). As expected, N-NP868R plus T7RNAP caused higher luciferase expression than T7RNAP alone, demonstrating the functionality N-NP868R and also the value of capping. N-NP868R also complemented expression by cappingdead mutant (K282N) C3P3-G1. However, addition of N-NP868R with C3P3-G1 marginally increased luciferase expression over C3P3 alone, suggesting that capping was already nearly saturated by C3P3. Similar findings we obtained with transcripts produced by standard nuclear expression system using CMV-driven promoter. These findings support that a majority of transcripts are efficiently capped by C3P3.",

We selected 54 complete bacteriophage genome sequences, which were analyzed for candidate phage-promoter sequences using the PHIRE software (55) . Twenty-nine RNAPs with wellcharacterized promoters were then subjected to BLAST+ analysis (56) , and clustered into 12 subgroups having <80% amino-acid identity (Supplementary Figure S9) . One member of each subgroup was randomly selected and fused to the carboxyl-end of NP868R via (G 4 S) 4 linker (Supplementary Table S5 ). For each RNAP, the putative phage promoter from the major capsid protein was inserted upstream of the luciferase gene and co-transfected with the corresponding C3P3-G1 enzyme plasmids (Supplementary Table  S5 ). While highest luciferase expression was achieved with SP6RNAP moiety (Figure 3D ), additional phage RNAPs having >80% amino-acid identity with SP6RNAP were examined in a second optimization step. The two closely related K1ERNAP and K1.5RNAP, which share 99% aminoacid identity together and 85% with SP6RNAP (57), were identified and fused in-frame with NP868R with best results given by K1ERNAP ( Figure 3D ). Overall these studies show that coupling of NP868R to prokaryotic RNAPs generates a novel cytoplasmic expression system. The tethered NP868R enzyme increases the expression of uncapped reporter mRNA produced by the T7RNAP or by the capping-dead mutant (K282N) C3P3-G1 system. In contrast, the expression of capped reporter mRNA produced by the C3P3-G1 system remains virtually unchanged, which suggests that most of C3P3-G1 transcripts are efficiently capped.",

To test if NP868R has all bona fide enzymatic activities, we expressed and purified histidine-tagged NP868R by baculovirus expression system and Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography, respectively ( Figure 5A ). The NTPase activity of NP868R was evidenced by in vitro conversion assay of [\u2423-32 P]-GTP or ATP into GDP or ATP. Figure 5B shows that NP868R displayed NTPase activity similar to that of the VVD1R subunit, which hydrolyses [\u2423-32 P]-GTP into GDP, or ATP into ADP (not shown). The GTase activity results from two steps reaction process in which the GTase first form a covalent link with GMP which is subsequently transferred on the 5 end of pRNA. The first step of this process (GTP-covalent binding) was demonstrated through incubation of NP868R with [\u2423-32 P]-GTP and MgCl 2 . A radiolabeled 99 kDa protein was observed under denaturing electrophoresis conditions, suggesting that NP868R forms a covalent adduct with the guanosine nucleotide similar to VVD1R and VVD1R-MTase ( Figure 5C ). The subsequent transfer of GMP to the 5 -end of RNAs was next monitored by incubating NP868R with synthetic 3 -end radiolabeled RNAs (pppAC 4 Cp), followed by urea-PAGE RNA product analysis. In presence of MgCl 2, NP868R induced a band-shift of RNA products. Migration patterns were similar to those observed when using VVD1R and VVD1R-MTase as positive controls, suggesting similar modification at the 5 -end of RNA blocked at their 3 -end by pCp labeling ( Figure 5D ). The nature of the cap structure was further analyzed by thin layer chromatography after RNA hydrolysis by nuclease P1. In the presence of the methyl donor S-Adenosyl-Methionine (SAM) and MgCl 2 , the positive control VVD1R, as well as NP868R could synthesize a m7 GpppA cap structure ( Figure 5E ), indicating that NP868R carries both N7-MTase and GTase activities. NP868R methylated GpppAC 4 , whereas a blocked N7-atom in the synthetic capped RNA ( m7 GpppAC 4 substrate) abolished 3 H-methyl transfer. NP868R thus carries N7-MTase but not ribose-2 -O-methyltransferase activities on these short substrates ( Figure 5F ). Altogether, these assays demonstrate that NP868R is a fully active capping enzyme.",

As judged by immunofluorescence microcopy, C3P3-G1 drives expression and localization of fluorescent proteins tagged for transport in the expected nuclear, mitochondrial, and endosomal compartments (Figure 7) . The localization of these fluorescent proteins to the endosomal and mitochondrial compartments was confirmed by the coexpression of EGFP fused to the human LDLR and rat OCT sorting signals, respectively (Supplementary Figure S13) . Noticeably, the morphological patterns of these fluorescent proteins appear similar when expressed using a standard nuclear expression system, therefore suggesting that the C3P3-G1 does not impair protein sorting (Figure 7) . To further confirm that the proteins produced by the C3P3-G1 system were properly processed, we assayed in culture medium the functional activity of the released hEPO, a N-and Oglycosylated secreted protein (60). Its activity was similar when produced by C3P3-G1 versus standard nuclear expression systems, showing normal protein folding and disulfide bond formation (Figure 8 ).

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first artificial expression system that successfully couples transcription and posttranscription, which are processes of exquisite complexity in eukaryotes. C3P3-G1 relies on a single-unit chimeric enzyme that consists of the fusion of an mRNA capping enzyme with a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The RNA polymerase moiety of the C3P3 enzyme transcribes in cellulo specific DNA templates under control of the C3P3 promoter and synthesizes RNA chains, which are subsequently capped by the capping enzyme moiety. In contrast, the polyadenylation of the C3P3 transcripts is synthesized by transcription of a polyadenosine track from the DNA templates. Therefore, once primed, the C3P3 expression system autonomously synthesizes RNA chains in the cytoplasm of the host-cell and generates the key modifications requested for their translation.",

As the vaccinia virus is an intracellular parasite that replicates exclusively in the host-cell cytoplasm, the T7-transcripts are 5 -capped and 3 polyadenylated in host-cell cytoplasm by the vaccinia virus enzymes (30) . Although the amounts of mRNA made by this system are extremely high, comprising \u223c30% of the total steady state RNA in the cytoplasm, only moderate amounts of T7-transcripts are properly 5 -capped (30) . A plausible explanation for these findings is provided by the crowded environment of the cytoplasm, which contains a dense network of cytoskeletal filaments, therefore impeding free diffusion of large macromolecules such as proteins, DNA and mRNA (61) . Due to the lack of coupling between the T7RNAP and vaccinia virus capping enzyme, the T7-transcripts are poorly 5 -processed by the vaccinia virus capping enzyme. This assumption was central for the development of the C3P3-G1 enzyme, which is preferably the fusion between the African Swine Fever Virus capping enzyme and a mutant bacteriophage K1E RNA polymerase.",

The resulting 3 -poly(A) tail cooperates synergistically with the 5 -capping to stimulate translation with supra-additive potentiation, presumably by circularizing mRNA (62) . In addition, poly(A) tails promote stability of the transcripts, while deadenylation is a major rate-limiting step in mRNA decay (63, 64) . In contrast to the nuclear polyadenylation, the poly(A) tail of the C3P3-G1 is generated by the templatedependent transcription of a short 40 adenosine track from the DNA template, followed by a self-cleaving ribozyme sequence. The length of the poly(A) tail of the C3P3-G1 transcripts encoded by the templates is therefore much shorter than those of mammalian transcripts, which exit the nucleus with a uniform length of \u223c250 nucleotides (65) (66) (67) (68) . As the length of the poly(A) tail is strongly correlated with the level of gene expression (69) , the polyadenylation from the C3P3-G1 expression system can be seen as sub-optimal. Further generations of the C3P3 system will improve the polyadenylation process, possibly by tethering a poly(A) polymerase to the C3P3 transcripts.",

Firstly, the mRNA The activity of hEPO produced by the C3P3-G1 system was comparable to the nuclear expression plasmid, therefore showing normal protein folding and disulfide found formation. The differences of activity profiles between Epoetin \u2424 and hEPO produced in CHO-K1 cells with the standard plasmid or the C3P3-G1 system might be explained by the use of distinct methods for measuring hEPO or other differences in line with the processing of Epoetin \u2424 product (20) .",

            "text": "modifications performed by the current generation of the C3P3 system might be incomplete. Our semi-quantitative assay ( Figure 4) suggests that the majority of mRNAs are capped by C3P3-G1. Nevertheless, even minor amounts of uncapped 5'-triphosphate RNA might induce retinoic acidinducible protein I (RIG-I)-mediated interferon-\u2423 response and host-cell translation shut-down (70, 71) . Interferon-\u2423 response can be also induced by the absence of cap-1 at the 5 -ends of transcripts, which is not accommodated by C3P3-G1 (72) . Strikingly, no frank modifications of ribosome distribution patterns were brought into focus by polysome profiling analysis. This finding does not support the hypothesis of global inhibition of host-cell translation as expected in case of strong interferon-response, but closer investigation of content of the polysomal fractions. The length of the polyadenylation tail is also known be critical for mRNA translation and should be increased by further generations of the C3P3 system. Secondly, other post-transcriptional modifications which are not performed by C3P3-G1 might be critical for mRNA translational efficiency. For instance, the reversible N6,2'-O-dimethyladenosine methylation at the first encoded nucleotide adjacent to the cap was recently found to influence cellular mRNA fate (73) . Alternatively, the absence of other modifications might induce the shut-down of host-cell translation, via interferon pathway or others (70) . For instance, internal bases can be subjected to modifications such as pseudouridination or methylation at uridine or cytosine residues, which decrease RNA-dependent protein kinase activation in response to exogenous RNA, then phosphorylates translation initiation factor 2-\u2423 (eIF2-\u2423) and inhibits translation (74, 75) . Thirdly, host-cell proteins, eventually deposited onto pre- messenger RNA or mRNA, might participate in translation. For instance, the exon junction complex, which is assembled onto pre-messenger RNA at the nuclear stage, contributes to both mRNA translational efficiency and decay (76, 77) . Fourthly, C3P3 transcripts might be inappropriately positioned in the cytoplasmic compartment for their translation by the host-cell machinery. For comparison, large cytoplasmic replicating DNA viruses, such as Poxvirus or Asfarvirus, form viral factories that sequester transcription factors, ribosomes, and chaperonins in circumscribed cytoplasmic sub-compartments. Altogether, these hypotheses will be systemically explored by deeper transcriptional and translational analysis for further improvements of the C3P3 system.",

Therefore, once expression of the C3P3 enzyme has been primed, it becomes independent of the passive diffusion of the input DNA through the nuclear pores. The diameter of their main channel, which is smaller than the classical diameter of plasmid DNA, explains their limited diffusion to the nucleus and possibly the limited efficacy of transient transfection (78) . For example, only 1-10% of the plasmids transfected to cultured cells can effectively reach their nuclei as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR, Southern blot analysis, or electron microscopy (79, 80) . Hence, the cytoplasmic processivity of the C3P3 system appears appealing for transient non-viral gene therapy, an attractive approach to deliver therapeutic Figure 11 .

The ORFs of corresponding plasmids were designed as follows: (A) no coupling domain, (B) T7RNAP fused in-frame to the carboxyl-terminal end of either D1R or D12L genes via the (G 4 S)4 linker, (C) fused in-frame with the leucine-zippers EE 1234 L and RR 1234 L, which forms a heterodimer in antiparallel orientation. EE 1234 L was fused to the amino-terminal end of T7RNAP, whereas RR 1234 L was fused either with D1R or D12L. Luciferase gene expression level is shown, as well as the relative value in comparison to the uncoupled condition. Luminescence was assayed in cell lysates 24 h after transfection and expressed in RLU normalized for hSEAP (secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase) expression expressed in DO (RLU/DO ratio).

Capping enzymes were selected by bioinformatic sequence analysis showing that the proteins contain the threeenzymatic domains required for mRNA capping (i.e. TPase, GTase and N7-MTase). Blocks stand for different domains and their annotations are listed at the bottom of the figure. The lengths of the blocks are directly proportional to their sequence length. The enzymatic domains of the well-characterized heterodimeric vaccinia virus capping enzyme are also shown.

Reverse constructions by in-frame fusion to the carboxyl-terminus of T7RNAP were not tested because T7RNAP does not tolerate carboxyl-terminal extensions(85,86).

(A) Coomassie-stained, reducing SDS-PAGE showing the insect-cell derived NP868R protein purified by Ni 2+ -affinity chromatography migrating at around 100 kDa. Protein ladder is shown on the right lane. (B) NTPase activity. Autoradiographs of 20% urea-PAGE gel show that NP868R and the D1R subunit of VV (VVD1 MTase) hydrolyze [\u2423-32 P] radio-labeled GTP to GDP. The hydrolysis of GTP by NP868R is stimulated by 2.5 mM MgCl 2 . (C) GTP-binding assay. Autoradiographs of 12% SDS-PAGE show that NP868R, VVD1R MTase and VVD1R form covalent adducts, after 1 h of incubation with [\u2423-32 P] radio-labeled GTP in presence of 2.5 mM MgCl 2 .The main radiolabeled bands are detected at a molecular weight corresponding to the incubated proteins. (D) GTase activity. A synthetic RNA (pppAC 4 ), radiolabeled at its 3 -end using [\u2423-32 P]-pCp (pppAC 4 -Cp*, Ctl) is incubated with NP868R, VVD1R MTase and VVD1R in presence of 1 mM GTP. The RNA reaction products, obtained after 1 h of incubation, are separated on a 20% urea-PAGE gel. The VV-capping enzyme (VVD1R and VVD1 MTase) used as positive control, convert pppAC 4 -Cp* into m7 GpppAC 4 -Cp* or GpppAC 4 -Cp*, respectively. The autoradiographs show that, in presence of 2.5 mM MgCl 2, NP868R convert pppAC 4 -Cp* RNA to a RNA migrating a molecular weight similar to the capped RNA generated by VVD1R proteins. (E) Cap structure identification. pppAC 4 RNA was incubated with [\u2423-32 P]-GTP in presence of NP868R, VVD1R MTase and VVD1R respectively. The reaction products were digested by nuclease P1, and the caps were separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). m7 GpppA is the predominant product seen in presence of the methyl-donor (SAM) using the VVD1, whereas VVD1R MTase synthesized mainly GpppA, as well as GTP hydrolysis products (GDP and GMP). m7 GpppA cap structure is detected when NP868R is incubated with SAM and 2.5 mM MgCl 2 , and GpppA in absence of SAM. (F) MTase activity. Activity of NP868R was assessed by monitoring the transfer of tritiated methyl (CH 3 ) from SAM to a short synthetic RNA (GpppAC 4 or m7 GpppAC 4 ) after 10 and 150 min. The bar chart experiment compares the activities of NP868R with that of human N7-MTase (N7-MTase) and SARS-COV 2 O-MTase known to methylate specifically the N7 position of the RNA cap structure and the 2 O position of capped RNA respectively. NP868R methylate the GpppAC 4 but not RNA already methylated on their N7 position ( m7 GpppAC 4 ) suggesting that the methylation occurs on the N7 position of cap structure. The error bars indicate the standard deviation of three experiments.",
