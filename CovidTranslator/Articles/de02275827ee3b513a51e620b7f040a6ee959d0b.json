Errors occur when a series of failures in the system occur, which is well illustrated by the Swiss cheese model [5] . This model likens human systems to multiple slices of Swiss cheese with holes, stacked side by side. Although highly technological systems have many defensive layers, such as guidelines and protocols, to prevent errors, each layer also has its own deficiencies like the holes in Swiss cheese. The presence of holes in any one \"slice\" does not allow a risk to materialize, as another layer of defense is in place. However, when the holes in many layers momentarily line up, a mistake passes through the holes in all of the slices, resulting in an unwanted incident. The systems approach advocates that a medical error is the result of a system flaw, not a character flaw [5] , which makes it easier for an individual to report an error promptly and honestly. This kind of robust reporting helps identify errors and strengthens problematic areas so that the same error does not occur again [9] .",

He was surprised when he was told that no such investigation would take place unless he sued or filed a formal complaint. An independent investigation was conducted, but Mr. Bromiley did not file charges against individuals and only hoped that some lesson might be taught to others as a result of a fair investigation. As he wished, all professionals involved in the case remained to serve and help the system to avoid similar errors.

Medical error cases are often so complex and debatable that honest and detailed reporting is key to identifying the reasons for the accident. An error reporting system is currently being used in the USA, UK, Denmark, and several other countries. The Danish Parliament passed the Act on Patient Safety in 2003, following a study reporting that 9% of patients admitted to a Danish hospital were involved in an adverse event [20] . This is the first legislation in the world that has sought to improve patient safety by ensuring that all adverse events are reported and that the National Board of Health will disseminate the results nationally [21] . The US Senate passed the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act (PSQIA) in 2005 [22] . The PSQIA introduced a voluntary reporting system to facilitate assessment of data to improve patient safety and healthcare quality. The UK's National Patient Safety Agency created the National Reporting and Learning System in 2003, which is a nationwide voluntary event-reporting system for patient safety [23] . Japanese healthcare workers are also familiar with event-reporting systems because all Japanese hospitals established an in-house, legally bound event-reporting system in 2002 [24] .

Several technological innovations have contributed substantially to patient safety [26] . One has been to introduce real-time patient monitoring systems, such as electrocardiography, pulse oximetry, and capnography. The laryngeal mask airway and video laryngoscope have had a huge effect on managing patients with a difficult airway.

For example, Korean Air had more plane crashes than almost any other airline in the world by the end of the 1990s. Gladwell blamed those crashes on crew members whose cultural legacy made them too deferential to communicate clearly about a problem that could cause the plane to crash [37] . This hierarchical communication also exists in the Korean medical profession and is one of the main causes of adverse events. Because medical service is delivered by a team, communication with other team members is important during patient care. Strong verbal communication skills in the context of a complex medical system is at the core of patient safety and effective teamwork.
