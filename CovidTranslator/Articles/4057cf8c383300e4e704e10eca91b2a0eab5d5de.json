            "text": "Emergent viruses and associated diseases comprise various and rather quite distinct entities, which can arise in a large part of the living world. Indeed, emerging viruses have been, and are still, frequently reported in a great variety of animals, from insects to humans, as well as in plants. Furthermore, some of these diseases, associated with emerging viruses, had recent major public health impact, as exemplified in humans by the AIDS [1] , hepatitis C pandemics [2] , or the current Ebola disease epidemic, or in crops by cassava mosaic disease, which seriously compromises food security in East Africa [3] . How can we define such emerging entities? Firstly, it can be a new disease, due to a yet unknown virus. In humans, the natural reservoir of such a virus is frequently an animal. These zoonoses include some coronaviruses present in specific bat species and the severe acute respiratory syndrome, hantaviruses present in rodents and various clinical syndromes, and some filoviruses, as Marburg and Ebola viruses, living in fruit bats and the associated hemorrhagic fevers. For plants, new viruses in crops are also thought to emerge from wild reservoirs: for instance, the Maize streak virus originates from wild African grasses. Strictly speaking, these are considered as real emergences. Secondly, it may be a known disease, in which one finds the causative viral agent. Here, we can cite for human diseases, some clinical hepatitis and the hepatitis C virus, the severe Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma and the human retrovirus HTLV-1, as well as a the Kaposi's sarcoma and the human herpesvirus 8. Examples in plants would be the identification of virus complexes associated with many known diseases of perennial crops, for example, grapevine leaf roll disease. Here, we are rather talking about 'emergence of knowledge'. Finally, it may be an already known virus, associated with a known disease, but with an epidemiological profile different from what was known before. We can mention the spread of West Nile virus in the United States in the early 2000s, the arrival of Chikungunya in the American continent in 2013, the dramatic current Ebola outbreak in West Africa, or the world-wide emergence in different temperate crops of Tomato yellow leaf curl and other begomoviruses associated with the spread of highly efficient vector species.",

            "text": "The causes of the emergence or resurgence of such viruses are many and varied [4, 5] . The emergence of a new viral associated disease or of a new virus is indeed the result of a sequence of successive steps, sometimes complex, and is often related to the entanglement of several factors: socioeconomic or particular cultural activities, increased mobility of human, animal and plant mobility ('the world is a global village'), human exploitation of the environment as deforestation or increase of agricultural or otherwise human managed land, resulting in loss of biodiversity or ecosystem simplification, disruption of human, animal and plant health systems in armed conflict, urbanization with development of huge slums of great poverty and basic hygiene, decreased interest in the surveillance and control of infectious diseases, use of unsterile medical equipment as part of therapeutic and/or mass vaccination and, finally, the ability of certain viruses to adapt quickly to a changing environment. This last point may be particularly significant for RNA and small single-stranded DNA viruses. It is crucial to note that all the factors that will increase the density of the human, animal and plants population, the density of vectors and/or reservoirs, and that will promote contact between these three elements, will favor emergence process.",

            "text": "Interspecies transmissions at the origin of the emergence of new viruses are common [6, 7] . One can mention for humans many arenaviruses and bunyaviruses having especially rodents as wild reservoirs, but also SIV and STLV retroviruses found naturally in many species of non-human primates. Finally, bats now appear as very important reservoirs of many viruses (Nipah, Hendra, Ebola, Coronaviruses, among others) that have recently emerged or are emerging in humans. Interspecies transmission is also considered as a first step in plant virus emergence. Although it is considered that host jumps are easier among taxonomically related species, reservoirs of emergent plant viruses often have not been identified, which has limited understanding emergence [5] . Interspecies transmission as related to emergence is a new vast field of research promoted, among other factors, by the power of high-throughput sequencing and related bio-informatics methods. After the initial stages of interspecies transmission per se ('spillover') following the encounters between the virus (and its natural reservoir) and the new host, viruses often need to adapt to the new host, resulting in virus loads high enough for transmission and spread in the new host population [7] [8] [9] . Dispersion in the new host population often follows new epidemiologic dynamics, and may be attained through various modes of transmission, including for humans sexual, nosocomial, direct contact, and aerosols, or through different vector species or new modes of host propagation (e.g., asexual vs. seed multiplication) in plants.",

Nicole Pavio et al. report the current data on the zoonotic origin of viral hepatitis E. Such possibility was suggested following the discovery of some animal strains of hepatitis E closely related to human HEV in countries where sporadic cases of hepatitis E were autochthonous. Domestic pigs and wild boars have been now recognized as the main HEV reservoirs. Thus, besides being primarily transmitted via fecal-oral route in human, infection through consumption of undercooked or raw meat and meat products contaminated by HEV has clearly demonstrated that such virus is a foodborne zoonotic pathogen. Direct contact with infected animal reservoirs is also a common source of zoonotic HEV.",

All hantaviruses, which belong to the Bunyaviridae family, share a negative strand DNA (12 kb). Some Hantaviruses can cause, in specific areas of the world, very severe diseases in humans (as hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome or pulmonary syndrome). The occasional spillover of hantaviruses from rodents to humans are at the origin of such severe clinical syndromes. In their review, Edward Holmes and Yong-Zhen Zhang emphasize the fact that rodents have long been considered as the primary host of hantaviruses with a classic model of hantavirus evolution thought to reflect a process of virus-rodent codivergence over a time-scale of millions of years. The recent findings that bats, moles and shrews are also reservoirs of Hantaviruses, associated with relatively frequent cross-species transmission, have greatly challenged such a theory for hantavirus evolution.",

Among these viruses, some are zoonotic and responsible of very severe infection in humans including filovirusesrelated diseases due to Marburg and Ebola viruses. Sylvain Baize reviews the situation of the current epidemic of Ebola disease that began in West Africa in 2014. Indeed, after being restricted to Central Africa for 35 years, the Ebola virus has suddenly emerged in Guinea in early 2014 and spread rapidly to Liberia and Sierra Leone. Some fruit bats appear to act as the reservoir for Ebola virus. However, the exact origin of the crossspecies transmission responsible for the current epidemic in West Africa remains unknown.",

Jasper Chan and colleagues emphasize in their review the role of birds in the cross-species transmission and emergence of zoonotic avian viruses. Intrusion of human into natural habitats of wild birds, domestication of wild birds as pets and mostly the increasing poultry consumption by humans have facilitated the emergence and dissemination of avian viruses that can cause zoonosis. Indeed, avian influenza viruses are usually amplified and mixed in the poultry population before cross-species transmission from poultry to humans occurs.

Similarly, the origin of most Human T cell Lymphotropic virus type 1 subtypes appears to be linked to interspecies transmission between STLV-1-infected monkeys and humans, followed by variable periods of evolution in the human host.

Classical hypotheses of plant pathology about ecosystem simplification and disease emergence, which converge with similar hypotheses in animal pathology [5, 11] , have just recently started to be tested experimentally or empirically. As Marilyn Roossinck and Fernando Garc\u00eda-Arenal review here, the few recent studies available point to a role of ecosystem simplification in plant virus emergence. Interestingly, analyses of virus infections in wild plants strongly suggest that the outcome of plant-virus interactions is highly environment-dependent, varying between mutualism and disease emergence.
