WHO activities cover a wider spectrum with programs like WHO-CHOosing Interventions that are Cost Effective (WHO-CHOICE). This program assists member states in setting priorities and identifying cost-effective interventions by assembling regional data on costs and health implications of interventions. Another example is the International Clinical Trial Registry Platform, which, while not an administrative register, aims to establish ethical standards for trials involving humans.

This includes not only conditions exclusive to the tropics, the true meaning of the term, but also conditions that have largely been controlled in first-world nations.

It has a three-pronged approach consisting of broader coverage with rapid impact interventions, strengthened vector control, and improved surveillance and high-quality care. The department is currently focused on the 13 conditions classified as neglected tropical diseases ( Table 2) . The department's operations are divided into four sections. The first of these, Disease Control in Humanitarian Emergencies, works in association with the Communicable Disease Working Group on Emergencies. The second section, Vector Ecology and Management, focuses on developing evidence-based strategies and providing technical support to interested parties in the area of control of vector-borne conditions. The third and fourth sections function in similar ways, engaging in research and providing technical support, but are distinguished based on three characteristics: availability of effective chemotherapeutic agents, intervention strategies available, and degree of implementation of these strategies. The third section, Preventive Chemotherapy and Transmission Control, deals with conditions for which effective chemotherapeutic agents and cost-effective intervention strategies exist. Thus, their focus is on the widespread implementation of these strategies. The fourth section, Innovative and Intensified Disease Management, is involved with conditions for which chemotherapeutic agents are available, but for which costeffective strategies have yet to be developed and implementation of strategies that do exist is minimal. Thus, the department focuses on refining existing strategies and increasing implementation of the best available strategies.",

Although modern medical schools (medical faculties) are centers for many other health-related social and investigative functions, they are primarily charged to produce well-trained 'compassionate healers,' certified to have completed basic academic courses and practical work in medical care and cure. Other institutions also train professionals to improve human well-being, but medical schools -in a form virtually unchanged for almost a century -remain the world's principal academic institutions designed to supply practitioners to care for human malaise, disease, and illness. For many, the training programs and goals of medical schools appear relatively noncontroversial. Society's mandate in improving medical care worldwide is to support and fund teaching institutions which emulate the so-called 'Western' or 'Flexnerian' medical education model. This academic model -scientifically grounded, evidencebased, university-affiliated, individual-and cure-oriented, and infinitely reproducible, is designed to foster the recruitment, training, and certification of practitioners to best care for the physical and mental frailties of mankind. Today's medical school training, grounded in sciencebased subjects believed to be essential to the rigorous medical curriculum, is essentially the same throughout the world, with academic and scheduling differences based on culture, governmental input, disease patterns, and the social and medical needs of each individual geographic area. In virtually all countries, academically prepared young men and women are selected, given a basic background in the scientific arts, exposed to advanced didactic and clinical skills in specific medical disciplines by competent practitioners, and -based on their successful completion of training -are licensed by society to use learned skills to care for and cure individuals. Once licensed, these new physicians are free to pursue advanced training, move into related fields, or follow other -usually health-oriented -paths. In most countries, completion of medical school and the awarding of the graduate degree brings with it significant social and economic rewards.",
