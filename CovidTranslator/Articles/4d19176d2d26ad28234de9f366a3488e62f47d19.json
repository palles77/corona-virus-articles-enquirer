Fifty five multiparous cows, stabled in the same farm, were randomly divided in three groups; cows of Group A were dressed on their back with deltamethrin, cows of Group B remained untreated within the same pen and cows of Group C remained untreated in a separate pen. Clinical records of the herd showed a history of clinical and subclinical mastitis (especially during spring and early summer) and fly infestation. Deltamethrin reduced fly population, landing on the cows of Group A, facilitating a significant decrease of S. aureus, coagulase negative staplylococci, E. coli intramammary infections and somatic cell count, throughout the study period. Consequently, there is a relationship between fly abundance and transmission of bacteria resulting in intramammary infections and mastitis in dairy cows. The use of the pyrethroid deltamethrin reduced fly abundance and therefore, the possibility of transmitting pathogenic bacteria in the mammary gland.

The structure of the buildings of the farm permitted the animals to have adequate rest area as well as to express normal feeding and drinking behavior. The routine vaccination program included a single vaccination one month before parturition of the heifers (approximately 24 months old) and the cows (at each gestation) against rotavirus, coronavirus and Escherichia coli K99 (Rotavec Corona \u00ae , MSD). Moreover, the herd had a history of subclinical and clinical mastitis (especially during spring and early summer) combined with fly infestation. Subclinical and clinical mastitis are defined as intramammary infections. Subclinical mastitis is characterized by the detection of more than 200.000 somatic cells/ml of each milk sample [44] , while the clinical one includes a more severe picture of either the milk (i.e. flakes, clots and watery or other unusual appearance) or the udder (i.e. swellings, redness) [36] , in at least one quarter of the mammary gland.

The experimental group consisted of only fifty five multiparous cows, because all animals had to be similar, as much as possible, in order to generate comparable results. They were between 3 to 5 years old and in lactation period 1-4 months post partum. These animals were fed with the same diet and premix, they had similar milk production and were living under the same hygiene conditions. These animals were randomly divided in 3 groups; cows of Group A (n = 25) were individually dressed once on their back with deltamethrin (Butox \u00ae 7.5 pour-on, MSD) post morning milking (Day 0). The application of Butox \u00ae 7.5 pour-on (MSD) was performed only once, because the registration instructions of this product state that it can be applied once at minimum every 4 weeks. At the same day (Day 0), placebo treatment was also applied once on the cows of Group B (n = 20, control group). All animals (n = 45) of groups A and B remained in the same pen allowing contact with each other. Additionally, another group (Group C), consisted of 10 cows, was left untreated and kept in a separate pen, a long distance away from the animals of Group A and B, in order to avoid any accidental drug transfer.",

More precisely, for Gram-positive cocci, which were cultivated in mannitol salt agar, catalase-tests were used to differentiate between catalase-positive staphylococci and catalase-negative cocci. DNAse activity, colony morphology, coagulase tube test and hemolysis pattern were used to discriminate S. aureus from CNS. Oxidase negative E. coli, which were cultivated in McConkey agar, were distinguished from other coliforms due to the lactose, catalase and indole positive activity on 44\u00b0C. Finally, catalase as well as esculin negative streptococci, which were cultivated in sheep blood agar, were identified according to the hemolytic reaction. Colonies, on mannitol salt and McConkey agars, were counted (CFU/ml) in order to estimate the bacterial population of staphylococci (S. aureus and CNS) and E. coli",

It is worth noted that heifers' infections represents almost one third of the new cases of S. aureus mastitis [9] . This is due to the fact that S. aureus can be transmitted from the infected mammary gland of the cows to unbred and pregnant heifers, especially with vectors such as flies [7, 13, 36] . The percentages of infection with S. aureus, among heifers, range from 0.6 to 8% [31] . Ryman et al. [14] reported a much higher (59.5%) prevalence of S. aureus intramammary infections in heifers than this reported by Fox et al. [31] . According to Ryman et al. [14] , this result was attributed to the role that horn flies play in the spread of S. aureus infections. Another study, conducted by Oliver et al. [9] , agreed with the above findings supporting that cows in lactation period were a source of S. aureus infection; thus leading to increased cases of heifer mastitis (spread of the disease) in the absence of fly control programs in the farm.",

The major mean of transmission of this type of mastitis is thought to be Hydrotaea irritans, a blood sucking fly [12, 51] . In cattle farms, high numbers of Hydrotaea irritans have been detected on the ventral abdomen and udder, and since the microorganisms involved in summer mastitis have been isolated from these flies, there is a strong evidence that these flies can transmit the disease. One survey, conducted in Sweden from 2002 to 2003, revealed the presence of Trueperella pyogenes in 64 out of 987 (6.1%) udder quarters milk samples [52] , while this percentage was lower in New York State, reaching 1.0% for multiparous cows [53] .

Cows with subclinical mastitis have higher possibility to develop clinical mastitis than are uninfected cows [46] . SCC is the number of white blood cells and epithelial cells, present in milk, as distinguished from invading bacterial cells [38] . Individual somatic cell count consists the best indicator to discriminate mastitis category, as SCC over 200.000 indicates subclinical mastitis [46] . In our study, the high numbers of SCC indicated severe intramammary infections of the cows. The application of deltamethrin reduced fly infestation, leading to lower shedding rate of the responsible bacteria for intramammary infections (e.g. S. aureus, CNS and E. coli) in milk samples. This reduced shedding resulted in lower number of SCCs in the same milk samples.",

At Day 30, the comparison of fly burden, in Group B and C, enhanced the possible explanations regarding the reduction of the mean fly population in untreated control group of cows (Group B) from Day 20 to 30. In addition, the mean numbers of S. aureus, CNS and E. coli intramammary infections and SCC in milk samples of Group C remained in high levels at the end of the study, something that was confirmed by the significant differences of the 20-30 AUC of these parameters. Therefore, the reduction of the mean fly burden as well as of the shedding rate of S. aureus, CNS, E. coli and SCC were largely attributed to the application of the fly repellent, deltamethrin.",
