A pairwise alignment of TGEV and MHV S aa sequences revealed that the N-terminal portion of S1 which is deleted in the porcine respiratory coronaviruses (PRCV) and HCV-229E, in comparison with TGEV, is the region corresponding to the MHV receptor binding-site (aa 1\u00b1330) (23) . The TGEV receptor-binding site is in a different location (aa 500\u00b1 700) and aligns with the S polymorphic region of the MHV strain. Recently, it was shown that only two aa changes at the N-terminus of TGEV S resulted in the loss of enteric tropism (13) . The S1 amino terminus speci\u00aeed by RBCV strains LSU and OK contained aa changes at aa11, aa115, aa118, aa173 and aa179 which may affect S1-mediated receptor binding. Hemagglutination of chicken red blood cells (RBC) was shown to be mediated by the S glycoprotein, because puri\u00aeed S of the EBCV Mebus strain agglutinated chicken RBC, while puri\u00aeed HE did not (10, 24) . RBCV strains LSU and OK agglutinated mouse and rat, but not adult chicken RBC (3). Therefore, aa changes within S speci\u00aeed by RBCV may be responsible for the inability to hemagglutinate chicken RBC. The S1A virus neutralizing (VN) immunoreactive epitope (aa 351\u00b1403) (25) was identical for all viral strains, except for a single aa change at aa 362 speci\u00aeed by the avirulent, cell culture-adapted strain EBCV-L9 (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, the S1A epitopes of HCV-OC43 and the BCV Mebus strain were identical (21) . Monoclonal antibodies (MABS) against the EBCV Mebus cross-reacted with different animal and human coronaviruses (25) . Therefore, it is likely that these antibodies react with the S1A epitope. The hypervariable region of the S glycoprotein contains the S1B immunoreactive epitope which is the target for virus neutralizing Mabs (25) . Four RBCV-speci\u00aec aa substitutions at aa 510, aa 531, aa 543 and aa 578 were located within or proximal to this epitope. Based on the observed aa changes, it can be predicted that Mabs speci\u00aec for this region may be able to distinguish between respiratory, enteric and vaccine BCV strains.",

Three mutations within the SI portion of S caused conservative aa changes, while one non-conservative aa change of His 470 to Asp was located within the S1 hypervariable region. All three mutations within S2 caused non-conservative amino acid changes. Amino changes within S1 and S2 may affect the structure and function of the S glycoprotein and alter the pathogenetic potential of these viruses. The 32 kDa ORF speci\u00aeed by RBCV virulent strains LSU and OK as well as EBCV LY-138 contained two frame-shift mutations which resulted in a 9 aa segment near the carboxy-terminus which was different from the corresponding amino acid sequence speci\u00aeed by the avirulent EBCV-Quebec strain (Fig. 4) . A similar double frame shift mutation was found in the 32 kDa ORF speci\u00aeed by HCV-OC43 (29) . These frame shift mutations increased substantially the hydrophilicity of the carboxy terminal portion of the 32 kDa protein in virulent versus avirulent strains (data not shown). Sequencing of the corresponding region of the 32 kDa protein of the avirulent EBCV L9 and Mebus strains as well as the 32 kDa of other virulent strains will substantiate these differences between virulent and avirulent strains. The aa substitution of Gly 53 to Val in the E protein was conserved for all BCV virulent strains (F15, LY-138, OK, LSU), HCV-OC43 (30) , and three different porcine HEV strains (22) .
