Secondary polycythaemia can generally be excluded by the clinical history and examination, assessment of serum erythropoietin concentration and arterial oxygen saturation, haemoglobin electrophoresis or high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) plus an oxygen dissociation curve and abdominal ultrasound examination. If initial screening tests are negative for a JAK2 mutation and there is no obvious secondary cause for the high Hct, then red cell mass studies are indicated (Chapter 17).",

Neutrophils are commonly increased during pregnancy and in acute infections, inflammation, alcohol intoxication, corticosteroid therapy and acute blood loss or red cell destruction. Additional findings on the full blood count can be helpful to identify the cause of neutrophilia. The combination of anaemia and neutrophilia occurs in chronic infection or inflammation, and also in malignant conditions; a high Hct with neutrophilia suggests polycythaemia vera. Neutrophilia with an increased platelet count occurs in infectious or inflammatory processes or malignant conditions and during marrow recovery. Neutrophilia with thrombocytopenia is classically seen in sepsis and occasionally in microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Examination of the peripheral blood film also provides additional clues to confirm or exclude a particular diagnosis. For example, neutrophilia with the neutrophils showing heavy cytoplasmic granulation ('toxic' granulation) is a common finding in severe bacterial infections. In the absence of any underlying cause, a high neutrophil count with immature myeloid cells suggests chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), and cytogenetic and molecular studies to look for t(9;22) and the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene are indicated (Chapter 8).",

Certain myeloid neoplasms, e.g. primary myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), are characterised by cytopenias, which are at least in part the result of ineffective haemopoiesis. Cytopenia is also sometimes a feature of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), when it is due both to ineffective haemopoiesis and to replacement of normal haemopoietic stem cells by leukaemic cells. A relatively common cause of a global reduction in circulating cells is pooling of the cells in a markedly enlarged spleen (hypersplenism), which may be secondary to conditions such as primary myelofibrosis and portal hypertension. Examination of a bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy specimen is often helpful in determining the cause of cytopenias for which no obvious cause is apparent.",

Laboratory confirmation of iron deficiency can be based on measurement of (1) serum ferritin or (2) serum iron plus either total iron-binding capacity or transferrin or (3) red cell protoporphyrin or (4) staining of bone marrow aspirates for iron (see Chapter 4). 6 A diagnosis of iron deficiency must be followed by a search for the cause. This should include specific questions relating to blood loss and dietary insufficiency and may require stool examination for parasites and occult blood, endoscopic examination of the gastrointestinal tract to exclude occult malignancy and tests for coeliac disease. The differential diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia includes anaemia of chronic disease (also known as anaemia of inflammation). Clinical and laboratory features of inflammation or chronic infection may suggest this diagnosis, which is confirmed by demonstration of normal or high serum ferritin and reduced serum iron, transferrin and iron-binding capacity. Serum soluble transferrin receptors may be helpful in distinguishing between iron deficiency anaemia and anaemia of chronic disease when interpretation of ferritin levels is difficult, though additional research is needed to define the overall diagnostic accuracy of these tests. 7 Ferritin normal, RBC high, Hb normal or near normal The thalassaemias also cause microcytosis, but both \u03b1 and \u03b2 thalassaemia trait are usually associated with an increased red blood cell count (RBC) and a normal or near-normal Hb despite a considerable reduction of the MCV and mean cell haemoglobin (MCH). In contrast, in iron deficiency the MCV and MCH do not fall until the Hb is significantly reduced. Further investigations, such as HPLC or haemoglobin electrophoresis supplemented by measurement of haemoglobin A 2 and haemoglobin F usually confirm the diagnosis of \u03b2 thalassaemia trait. The diagnosis of \u03b1 thalassaemia trait is more difficult; detection of infrequent haemoglobin H inclusions is usually possible in \u03b1 0 thalassaemia trait, but definitive diagnosis requires deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) analysis (see Chapter 8) . 8 A diagnosis of \u03b1 0 thalassaemia heterozygosity can be clinically important for prediction of haemoglobin Bart' s hydrops fetalis.",

Frequent causes of spurious thrombocytopenia include blood clots in the sample, platelet clumping and platelet satellitism. Platelet clumping, which is seen on the blood film, can occur in vitro as the result of a temperaturedependent or anticoagulant-dependent autoantibody or on slides that have been made directly from a finger prick sample. True thrombocytopenia is most frequently the result of autoantibodies (i.e. immune thrombocytopenia), HIV infection, anticancer chemotherapy, other drugs (such as thiazide diuretics), alcohol excess, hypersplenism and MDS. Heparininduced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis is a particularly important syndrome to recognise (see Chapter 20).",

A normal platelet count with an abnormal in vitro platelet function test is characteristic of a disorder of platelet function, but some patients with abnormal platelet function also have thrombocytopenia. Hereditary disorders of platelet function are uncommon and usually present as a bleeding diathesis. When a qualitative disorder of platelets is suspected, platelets should be examined to assess size and to detect the cytological features of platelet alpha-granule deficiency (i.e. grey platelet syndrome). Neutrophils should also be examined for inclusions indicative of MYH9-related disorders such as the May-Hegglin anomaly. Qualitative disorders of platelets can broadly be divided into two categories: abnormalities of the platelet membrane glycoproteins (e.g. Bernard-Soulier syndrome, Glanzmann thrombasthenia) and abnormalities of platelet secretory function (e.g. storage pool diseases). Acquired disorders of platelet function are more common than inherited disorders. Haematological conditions associated with platelet dysfunction include myeloproliferative neoplasms, MDS and dysproteinaemias (in plasma cell neoplasms). Many widely prescribed drugs, including aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, interfere with platelet function. Systemic conditions, particularly chronic renal failure and cardiopulmonary bypass, are also associated with a bleeding tendency as a result of qualitative platelet defects. Most of these acquired functional defects are not associated with any abnormality in platelet appearance but in MDS and, to a lesser extent, in the myeloproliferative neoplasms, there may be hypogranular and giant platelets.",

Cases with pancytopenia should be classified as MDS-U. ** If the marrow myeloblast percentage is <5% but there are 2-4% myeloblasts in the blood, the diagnostic classification is RAEB-1. Cases of RCUD and RCMD with 1% myeloblasts in the blood should be classified as MDS-U. \u2020 It is proposed that, if an SF3B1 mutation is present, cases with at least 5% ring sideroblasts be included in this category, and should similarly be included in the newly proposed category of MDS with multilineage dysplasia and ring sideroblasts (Arber 2015). \u2021 Cases with Auer rods and <5% myeloblasts in the blood and <10% in the marrow should be classified as RAEB-2. Although the finding of 5-19% blasts in the blood is, in itself, diagnostic of RAEB-2, cases of RAEB-2 may have <5% blasts in the blood if they have Auer rods or 10-19% blasts in the marrow or both. Similarly, cases of RAEB-2 may have <10% blasts in the marrow but may be diagnosed by the other two findings, Auer rods and/or 5-19% blasts in the blood. \u00b6 It is proposed that one additional cytogenetic abnormality (excluding monosomy 7) be accepted in this category (Arber 2015). tryptase stain is often crucial in the diagnosis. Molecular analysis for a KIT mutation can also be important. Recognition of lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms associated with rearrangement of PDGFRA, PDGFRB or FGFR1 and PCM1-JAK2 requires cytogenetic and molecular analyses. Appropriate molecular analysis may be either FISH or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The diagnosis of chronic eosinophilic leukaemia, not otherwise specified, requires exclusion of the above-specified molecular abnormalities.",
