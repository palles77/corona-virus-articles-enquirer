These networks can inform preand posttravel patient management by providing complementary surveillance information, facilitating communication and collaboration between participating network sites, and enabling new analytical options for travel-related research. The two major multinational sentinel networks are TropNetEurop and GeoSentinel. Practical examples demonstrating their signifi cant contributions to improved travel health information are discussed. Data obtained from studying health problems among travelers may also have signifi cant benefi ts for local populations in resource-limited countries. However, there are limitations of data collected by sentinel networks, so they should be considered as complementary tools and not relied on as an exclusive basis for evaluating health risks among travelers.",

Historically, new diseases have often fi rst emerged in resource-limited countries, but initial detection and reporting have been from Western countries because diagnostic capabilities and networks for disseminating information are often not available in developing countries. Examples of such diseases include HIV and Marburg hemorrhagic fever [5\u2022] . Because travelers potentially expose themselves to all types of infectious diseases, studying illnesses among travelers can provide new insights into the presence, distribution, and transmission patterns of infections among local populations in the places they have visited [6] [7] [8] [9] . Data collected by sentinel networks may enable identifi cation of rare diseases among travelers, and temporal clustering of imported infections may serve as an early indicator of increased disease activity, possibly suggesting changes in the local epidemiology of infections [9] . Thus, increased knowledge of health problems that occur among sentinel travelers can provide signifi cant insights into circulating health risks among local populations. The surveillance infrastructure and diagnostic technology accessible in developed countries therefore can be the source for identifying new outbreaks or emerging foci of infections for areas with limited public health resources, and is complementary to local surveillance systems. Disease surveillance among travelers may also be the mechanism for detecting new disease syndromes, or may herald emerging resistance patterns among microorganisms.",

This reporting mechanism differs from many conventional surveillance programs' reliance on public health laboratories and local health departments for case reporting, often after a substantial time lag [7, 22] . Although laboratory testing to confi rm diagnoses will usually be performed, clinically based reporting facilitates much more rapid information fl ow and a faster response time.",

However, detection of an unusual increase in cases of a disease imported from specifi c countries generally requires several patients, which for tropical diseases may be feasible only by combining surveillance data from several sentinel units [9] . Sentinel networks enable rapid inquiry regarding additional cases among affi liated sites, so if one member site sees an unusual case, they can immediately notify the rest of the network and quickly determine if a pattern can be established. If a suspicious cluster is revealed, an outbreak may or may not be occurring, but it signals that additional examination of disease activity may be warranted. Facilitation of a collegial approach to information sharing between clinical sites is a fundamental aspect of these networks. Additionally, the establishment of communication links between network members provides a structured, effi cient mechanism for early dissemination of alerts regarding suspected changes in disease activity. Recognized clusters of events may then be posted onto ProMed (www.promedmail.org) or similar alert systems for wider dissemination of information.",

It is estimated that about 8% of travelers have symptoms warranting presentation to a doctor either during or after return from their travels, but obviously many will present to clinics outside surveillance networks [26, 27] . Sentinel clinics are likely to see a different patient population than general clinics. Recently returned travelers with unusual, severe, or persistent symptoms, or those who have had prolonged travel, may be more likely to go to sentinel clinics, whereas unwell travelers with common, nonspecifi c symptoms (eg, fever, respiratory symptoms, or diarrhea) may be more likely to visit a general practitioner. Therefore, patients who have certain demographic characteristics, have travelled to certain exotic destinations, or have symptoms suggestive of an exotic imported illness may be more likely to be referred to a specialized clinic, and this introduces selection and reporting biases [25\u2022] .",

A study examining fever in 6957 unwell travelers returning to GeoSentinel sites found that causes of fever varied by region visited and by time of presentation after travel [40] . Although malaria was the most common specifi c etiologic diagnosis overall, among travelers to Southeast Asia, dengue was most common. GeoSentinel data have also been used to determine factors associated with acquisition of fi larial infection [41] and travel characteristics associated with animal-associated injuries [42] . These types of analyses can assist the clinician in refi ning appropriate pretravel advice and in guiding posttravel empiric therapy.",

However, exposures, behaviors, and immunity status among travelers and local inhabitants may be quite different, and the local infrastructure for surveillance of disease trends and emerging disease risks may be far from ideal. Establishing sentinel surveillance networks has several fundamental benefi ts, including provision of additional complementary surveillance information that may warn of potential health problems among local populations in resource-limited countries. These networks facilitate communication and collaboration between participating network sites. They use travelers as a sentinel population and have demonstrated their potential role in detecting outbreaks and recognizing changing antimicrobial resistance patterns.",

Nevertheless, an understanding of the limitations and inherent biases of data collected by sentinel networks is crucial.
