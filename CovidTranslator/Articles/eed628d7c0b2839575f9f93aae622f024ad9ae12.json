We used these multi-patch, flux-based models to determine how the time course of infected and susceptible populations depends on the disease parameters, the geometry of the migrations between the patches, and the addition of infected people into a patch. We found that there are significantly longer lived transients and additional \"ancillary\" epidemics when the reproductive rate R is closer to 1, as would be typical of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and bird flu, than when R is closer to 10, as would be typical of measles. In addition we show, both analytical and numerical, how the time delay between the injection of infected people into a patch and the corresponding initial epidemic that it produces depends on R.",

            "text": "There are different ways to model the spatial-temporal patterns in a continuously distributed population. One approach is to use the set of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) which incorporates both temporal and spatial processes at the same time [1] [2] [3] . PDEs are used to model a variety of ecological phenomenon such as the dispersal of species, ecological invasions, the effect of habitat geometry, and the formation of diffusion-driven spatial patterning [1] . These methods have shown that the movement of organisms can produce large-scale patterns in homogeneous environments and that the movement of multiple species can change the outcome of competition or predation in heterogeneous environments. Recently, the PDE approach has been used to model a spatial epidemic following the point release of a rapidly dispersing infectious agent. It was demonstrated that the resulting epidemic exhibits two distinct phases: the primary phase where the epidemic wavefront propates at constant speed and a secondary phase with a deceleration wavefront [3] . This approach can also be applied to understand the traveling waves of epidemics, such as those that have been observed in the spread of Dengue haemorrhagic fever [4] . Another approach is to use agent based models that follow each individual in the population [5] [6] [7] . Agent based models are either highly computationally demanding because they must include the several parameters of each individual agent, which for some models can consist of millions of agents, or they must assume some distribution of parameters across the set of agents without full empirical knowledge of the parameters of each agent. Here we take a different coarse grained approach that captures important aspects of the spatial heterogeneity, yet is computationally simple, and can model specific cases of the spatial-temporal spread of disease. This approach is based on dividing the population into individual locations, called \"patches\". The spread of infectious diseases in each patch can be described by ordinary differential equations [8, 9] . In the simplest classical model, we model the number of susceptible people, S, and infected people, I , homogeneously distributed in each patch, by using the following set of ordinary differential equations",

However, even chemical reactions, which become less well mixed as the reaction proceeds, display a different (and time dependent) dependence on N [12] . The review by McCallum et al. [13] concludes that \"increasingly, the weight of evidence is that simple mass action (\u03b2IS) is not an adequate model in many situations. A clear default alternative has yet to emerge\". With this uncertainty in mind, we have here chosen to use the (\u03b2/N)IS form of this term, which we have found useful in our previous studies [14, 15] . This simplest form of the classical model having only one patch is not adequate to represent the spatial heterogeneity in the distribution of susceptible and infected people that is actually found. We therefore introduce the spatial heterogeneity by modeling the population as organized into a number of separate patches of different sizes with different infectious parameters in each patch [5] [6] [7] . We then compute the epidemics in each patch as the patches interact with each other. This patch approach provides a tractable way of modeling and studying the coarse grained spatial heterogeneity. We can then use these patch models to understand how the epidemics in a single patch are driven by its interaction with other patches and the injection of infected people into one of the patches.",

We studied two different dynamical regimes, where the intrinsic dynamics of the large patch was either periodic or chaotic. We used Fig. 1 for the periodic and chaotic regimes each with R = 1.575 and R = 15.75. We first consider the periodic regime for both values of R. Fig. 1(b) shows that for R = 15.75, the injection of infected people from the small patch induces corresponding epidemics in the large patch. After time, that we call the \"infected-induced transient time\", the system to returns to its base dynamical state before the infectious people were injected. Fig. 1(c) shows that for R = 1.575, the injection of infected people from the small patch also induces corresponding epidemics in the large patch. However, unexpectedly, there are also additional epidemics, which we call \"ancillary\" epidemics, in the large patch even though the small patch has no epidemic at that time. These ancillary epidemics are not the result of new infected people entering the larger patch. What is happening here is that the first epidemics in the large patch pushes that patch into a new part of phase space, far from its original base dynamical state, causing the large patch to produce a second epidemic all by itself. We also studied how the presence of these ancillary epidemics depends on the rate of migration, r, from the small patch into the large patch. As r is decreased from 0.5 to 0.01, these additional epidemics decreased and the R = 1.575 case then behaved as the R = 15.75 case.",

There is only a brief phase delay in the timing of the epidemics in the series of patches. This is because the epidemics along the line of patches are not triggered by epidemics in each patch which are then passed on to the next patch. Rather, it is the small influx of infected people which moves rapidly through all the patches which excites each patch, almost simultaneously, off of its base dynamical state and into an epidemic. In the model shown in Fig. 5(d) with 3 patches and R = 15.75, all the patches have one large simultaneous epidemic triggered by the injection of infected people. In both models, the infected-induced transient time is rapid and the system returns to its base periodic dynam-ical state is a short time.

This result is illustrated in Fig. 6 (d) which compares too very different mathematical approaches, each with somewhat different limitations in their accuracy; namely, numerical finite difference integration and a global analytical approximation. Considering the variability of epidemics and the approximations in measuring them in the numerical computations and the approximations made in the analytical derivation, Eqs. (8)- (14) , we note that both the analytical and numerical results have very similar functional forms, even though they are not equal. We consider the correspondence between the numerical and analytical form of this relationship valuable confirmation of the essential concept, namely, that the time to the first epidemic depends significantly and inversely on their reproductive rate R.",

We showed here how the intrinsic epidemics driven by an annual driving term and the injection of infected people into a patch can spread to other patches. The strength and timing of these subsequent epidemics depends on the strength and geometry of the migration between the patches and on the reproductive rate, R, of the disease. The most salient observation of the different conditions described here is that when R is close to 1, as is the case for SARS and bird flu, then the transients generated in the patches are of long duration and there are additional \"ancillary\" epidemics that are not due to further input of infected people, but rather are a manifestation of the fact that the previous epidemic has pushed the dynamical state of the patch far from its base dynamical state. These ancillary epidemics may have important implications for policy makers deciding how to respond to additional epidemics after an initial induced event. In this regime of R = 1.575 and periodic parameters, the initial epidemic is produced by injection of infected people. However, the subsequent ancillary epidemics do not correspond to the injection of additional infected people. That is, the ancillary epidemic represents a rebound of the system, rather than a second event of injected infected people. In addition we showed both analytically and numerically how the time to the first epidemic after the injection of infected people depends on the reproductive factor R.",
