Despite the computing power of supercomputers, computationally predicting secondary structures with thermodynamic methods is still not feasible when the RNA molecules have long nucleotide sequences and include complex motifs such as pseudoknots. This paper presents RNAVLab (RNA Virtual Laboratory), a virtual laboratory for studying RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots that allows scientists to address this challenge. Two important case studies show the versatility and functionalities of RNAVLab. The first study quantifies its capability to rebuild longer secondary structures from motifs found in systematically sampled nucleotide segments. The extensive sampling and predictions are made feasible in a short turnaround time because of the grid technology used. The second study shows how RNAVLab allows scientists to study the viral RNA genome replication mechanisms used by members of the virus family Nodaviridae.",

            "text": "Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is made up of four types of nucleotide bases: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U). A sequence of these bases is strung together to form an RNA molecule that, unlike deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), is often single-stranded. RNA molecules vary greatly in size, ranging from about 20 nucleotide bases in microRNAs to long polymers of over 30,000 bases comprising entire viral genomes [1] . Among the four nucleotide bases, C and G form a complementary base pair by hydrogen bonding, as do A and U and, less frequently, G and U. Although a single-stranded RNA molecule is a linear polymer, it tends to fold back on itself to form a three dimensional (3D) functional structure mostly by pairing between complementary bases. The 3D structure of an RNA molecule is often the key to its function. Because of the instability of RNA molecules, experimental determination of their precise 3D structures is a time consuming and rather costly process. However, useful information about an RNA molecule can be gained from knowing its secondary structure, which refers to the collection of hydrogen bonded base pairs in the molecule. Essentially, all RNA secondary structures are made up of elements 0167-8191/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.parco.2008.08.002 that can be classified into two basic categories: stem-loops and pseudoknots (see Fig. 1 ). Both kinds of secondary structure elements have been implicated in important biological processes such as gene expression and regulation for stem-loops [2] and pseudoknots [3, 4] . We also note that in both stem-loops and pseudoknots, it is necessary to have a stretch of nucleotide sequence (ACCGUC in Fig. 1a and b) followed by its inverted complementary sequence (GACGGU) downstream. For simplicity, we shall refer to these kinds of patterns as close inversions. The development of mathematical models and computational prediction algorithms for stem-loop structures based on thermodynamic models started in the 1980s [5, 6] . Pseudoknots, because of the extra base pairings, must be represented by more complex models and data structures. Despite the computing power of supercomputers and emerging advanced technologies, e.g., multi-core architectures, the prediction of secondary structures of long RNA sequences (on the order of thousands of nucleotides) based on thermodynamic methods, e.g. [7] , is still not feasible, especially if the structures include complex secondary structures like pseudoknots. The time and space required for accurate predictions of pseudoknots based on energy minimizations grow very rapidly with the sequence length. Fig. 2 shows the time and memory (in logarithmic scale) allocated for the prediction of RNA pseudoknots with various lengths using one of the most accurate prediction programs, Pknots-RE [8] . The algorithm underlying Pknots-RE has a runtime and memory demand in the order of n 6 and n 4 , respectively, where n is the length of the input sequence [8] . The program conducts an exhaustive search for the optimal structure with the lowest free energy and has the capability to predict rather complex structures, even some non-planar structures, for short RNA segments up to 200 nucleotides in length. To overcome the tremendous demand on computing resources needed by pseudoknot prediction, alternative algorithms have been proposed (e.g., Pknots-RG [9] , ILM [10] , and HotKnots [11] ) that tend either to restrict the types of pseudoknots or the length of the secondary structure to be predicted to keep runtime and memory size under control. For instance, the program Pknots-RG [9] limits the types of pseudoknots to simpler structures for longer segments, up to 800 nucleotides. However, a large variety of pseudoknots have been shown to occur in nature. Their omission from computational methods may significantly affect the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, even the simplified programs are not able to predict secondary structures on the order of thousands of nucleotides.",

            "text": "Our analysis of the length of pseudoknots in a widely used database known as PseudoBase [12] , which collects 245 pseudoknots, shows that most pseudoknots known to date are formed by RNA segments whose lengths are less than 200 nucleotides, i.e., 95% of the segments in the database have lengths that range between 20 and 200 nucleotides. The range of lengths between 30 (lower quartile) and 67.5 (upper quartile) nucleotides covers 50% of all segments. This observation leads to the idea of overcoming the computing constraints presented above by developing a strategy for cutting long RNA sequences into segments not longer than 200 bases in length and distributing the task of structure prediction of each segment to be done simultaneously on different computers. Ideally, if two segments that are cut from the same RNA sequence overlap each other, then the predicted structures of their overlapping part should be consistent with one another. Such consistency is important for the final structure assembly. In preliminary work, we observed that arbitrarily cutting the RNA sequence into overlapping segments is not advantageous for consistency. It is well conceivable that when an arbitrary cut goes through the middle of a close inversion, the bases forming the pairings do not get into the same segment, resulting in the omission of the structure from that prediction. For instance, consider a 100 base segment of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus genome, which is one of the coronavirus genomes analyzed by Chew et al. in [13] , from position 25,884 to 25,983 and another segment from position 25,923 to 26,022. When the program Pknots-RE is applied to these segments, two predictions are produced which are shown in Fig. 3 . Note that, over the stretch of the 62 bases that the two segments overlap one another, the two predictions are different. This kind of inconsistency poses a serious problem when the predicted structures of the segments need to be assembled.",

In addition, once motifs are predicted from sampled segments, they have still to be assembled together into complete secondary structures. Both predictions and rebuilding can significantly benefit from the combined prediction capability of different codes, as opposed to using the single codes separately [14] . Prediction of large numbers of short, overlapping segments is still computationally demanding but it also allows massive task parallelism that can be addressed with grid computing resources. Of course, the scientist who uses such an approach of sampling and rebuilding from segments to predict longer secondary structures has to benefit from the computing capabilities of such a framework without being required to cut and paste results from one code output to another, redirecting or reformatting output files (e.g., from FASTA to EMBL format) before forwarding them to the next step in the analysis, or dealing with distributed computer systems. Therefore, the ideal computing environment for the scientist should integrate key services and functionalities by combining different mechanisms and programs in an automated, computationally powerful, and reliable cyberinfrastructure accessible through an easy-to-use, familiar interface.",

However, to retrieve pieces of information from these sources as well as to sort and elaborate the data with these tools, scientists have to do significant handwork by sorting, computing, merging, and comparing results as well as extrapolating conclusions. For instance, when dealing with pseudoknots, scientists need to access databases such as PseudoBase [12] , which are not always provided with advanced search engines. The data from the database has to be copied into files of different format (e.g., FASTA and EMBL). Ultimately the scientists have to download and install codes on platforms that do not always fully support the code execution. Even if portable, some of these codes require significant amount of computing power that is not always available on the scientist's PC. An alternative is to submit the retrieved data to portals that provide prediction and visualization functions. However, the portals provide single prediction approaches that force the scientists to find multiple portals for their prediction. Ideally scientists should be led through the different steps by a unified, easy-to-use environment that screens them from database issues providing them with powerful tools for search, prediction, analysis, and visualization.",

In general, SCFGs are outperformed by physics based approaches, although recently Do et al. proposed a generalization of SCFGs where a flexible and richer feature set allows to include free energy parameters more akin to thermodynamic models [21] . However, the complexity of the RNA secondary structures predicted by these methods is restricted by the expressibility of their grammars, thus highly complex structures, such as pseudoknots, cannot be predicted by SCFGs.

In Seed, the search space is constrained by the seed sequence, which is just one of the sequences in the set used to instantiate valid motifs. Seed ranks motifs using a metric that combines the entropy of the segment with the free energy of the secondary structure, as computed by MFOLD [7] .

Condor provides all of the functionalities needed to implement a seamless grid layer that allows for faster prediction of RNA secondary structures by harnessing the idle cycles of computers, i.e., workstations and clusters, across the campus. The pool of machines on which RNAVLab is currently relying consists of 23 single-, double-, and quad-processor 32-and 64-bit machines, and while all these machines run Linux (i.e., Fedora, Kubuntu, SuSE), Condor can also be installed on Unix, Windows (e.g., 2000, XP), and Macintosh (OS X) machines, among others. Condor handles all the details of sending executable and data files to computing resources and retrieving the computation results. Furthermore, Condor provides other useful features, such as checkpointing and job migration that only require re-linking the prediction programs used by RNAVLab with Condor libraries. These features can be very helpful, especially with predictions that take a long time: if the application is interrupted, checkpointing saves the computation's state so it can be resumed later (instead of starting from scratch), and job migration allows a saved state to resume execution in a different machine. RNAVLab successfully re-links Pknots-RE and NuPack, but not Pknots-RG, due to its use of pthreads. Therefore, Pknots-RG cannot use checkpointing and job migration, but it can still be dispatched to the computing resources. Pknots-RG is usually the fastest of all three programs and therefore checkpointing may not be necessary or even helpful.",

Each job consists of a unique identifier, the name of the prediction program to be used (e.g., Pknots-RE, Pknots-RG, and NuPack), and the command-line parameters (i.e., the input files with the RNA sequences). The XML format is converted into a Condor submit file format, and Condor is used to submit the jobs to the pool. Condor also provides the functionality needed to check whether a submitted job has completed execution: this functionality is blocked while the job is running and only returns when the job is completed. Once all the jobs are submitted through Condor, RNAVLab sequentially checks for the completion of jobs. If RNAVLab stalls because a job is not finished, it does not stall the other jobs, since they are already on the queue. Once jobs are completed, their results are forwarded to the structure analysis component and visualized, if required by the user, on the interface. Although the current pool of machines used by RNAVLab consists only of Linux machines, future work includes its extension to clusters available across the campus as well as the integration and support of BOINC (Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing) [30] to allow researchers to deploy desktop and laptop PCs owned by students or administration personnel outside the campus when these computers are idle. Work in [17] shows that adding idle cycles of PCs significantly increases available computing power.",

Bonds GC, CG, UA, and AU are assigned tags from 1 to 4, respectively. The closures of the bonds are all assigned 0. The resulting numerical strings are compared and when two non-zero numbers and their respective closing 0 match, it is counted as a true pair. This approach is useful when the types of nucleotide bonds are important. Fig. 7 shows an example of comparison of a predicted string (Fig. 7a) with an observed string (Fig. 7b ) by using the variant of the Hamilton algorithm. The two strings of brackets associated with the prediction and observed secondary structures are converted to two strings of numbers in Fig. 7c . The strings of numbers are compared and the related sensitivity and selectivity are computed. Here, high sensitivity expresses the ability to predict all observed pairs and high selectivity expresses the ability to only predict observed pairs. A stack based algorithm (Comp. Stack) -the algorithm uses stacks to keep track of the positions of open parenthesis and brackets in secondary structures with and without pseudoknots. When an open bracket or parenthesis is encountered, its position is pushed into a stack associated to a stem-loop. Pseudoknots are considered to be a combination of two stemloops and therefore use two stacks. When a closed bracket or parenthesis is encountered, the position is popped from the associated stack. If a bracket or parenthesis is encountered at the same time in both structures and the position popped from both stacks is the same, this is counted as a true pair. This approach is useful when the identification of exactly alike structures is important. Fig. 8 shows two examples of comparison with this approach: in Fig. 8a the secondary structures are very similar but the bonding nucleotides are shifted and therefore, the comparison has sensitivity and selectivity equal to zero. In Fig. 8b , three bonds in the first string have the same position as three bonds in the second string and this matching results in a higher score for this example in terms of sensitivity and selectivity. A lenient algorithm (Comp. OC -Open-Close parenthesis) -the algorithm uses simple string comparisons that allows for similar yet shifted structures to receive high comparison scores. The algorithm traverses two bracket strings and counts how many times an open bracket or parenthesis is in the same position and how many times a closed bracket or parenthesis is in the same position for the strings, without considering the type of nucleotides involved. The smaller of these two values is the amount of true pairs. Fig. 9 compares the two strings already compared in Fig. 8a with the stack based algorithm. By using the lenient algorithm, higher sensitivity and selectivity are achieved.",

The tool proceeds as follows: first it identifies all the valid secondary structures, from the most simple (e.g., a hairpin comprising a few base pairs) to the most complex (e.g., pseudoknots), that can be generated from the input of secondary structures. Then by using an associative array of linked lists, the tool finds and stores the locations of each substructure generated in the previous step. To narrow down the number of motifs and identify the most relevant ones, ranking techniques are applied. Ranking criteria include: the frequency of the motif over the maximal number of possible occurrences, the number of bonding nucleotides, the length of the secondary structure, and the motif location in the RNA segment. Other possible ranking criteria can include information of the primary structure such as the percentage of bases correctly matched, and/or free energy of the structure as in [34] . In RNAVLab, we score motifs based on their frequency \u00f0f \u00de, number of base pairs \u00f0s\u00de, and the length of the overlapping region \u00f0o\u00de:",

The algorithm in Fig. 11 was inspired by previous work such as [22, 23, 34] . A key difference is the lack of an ad hoc design: no prior knowledge is assumed about existing motifs and the goal is to discover the motifs that are more likely to be part of the native structure. The algorithm of the Motif Identifier is simple but particularly powerful because it allows identifying complex structures such as pseudoknots. Lastly, since the design is modular new features such as different rank- ing functions can be easily added. The different tools in the Analysis component can be combined to perform more complex operations on the secondary structures. For instance, motifs that have been identified by the Motif Identifier can be aligned and compared by any of the alignment and comparison tools. Information on the consistency of the prediction results collected can be fed back to the database and made available to the segment sampler component to adjust the sampling strategy and adaptively identify new RNA segments for predictions.",

This is to create an immediate familiarity for the users as well as maintain a simple comprehensive infrastructure. The interface includes four tabs: database, tools, full results, and previous results. The database tab is a representation of RNA secondary structures in the database. The tools tab is divided into two main sections. One of the sections maintains total functionality with visual representations for the database of sequences, results pertaining to the user's requests, and previously obtained results. This section is conveniently organized with a tabled panel allowing quick access to any sub-section (Fig. 12 , section on the left). The other main section of the interface provides a constant representation of all concurrent processes being performed by the user as well as a list of each of these processes once they are completed (Fig. 12 , section on the right). By selecting any of these processes, the results pertaining to that particular process are displayed conveniently on an information panel located just below in the section on the right in the information window. Though the results are saved and displayed in the full result tab and previous results tab, the visualization in the information window is implemented to allow direct comparisons to several outcomes simultaneously. The interface is capable of supporting two different types of processes through the tools tab, one of sampling and prediction and the other of analysis. Each process has its own convenient selection section with easy checkbox and radio-button options. Each section maintains a copy of the database of sequences with independent sub-lists designated to separate desired sequences or groups of sequences. The first section on the top of the tools tab allows the sampling and prediction with Pknots-RE, Pknots-RG, and NuPack either locally (on the local machine) or globally (across the UTEP campus machines) in accordance to the particular selected sequences or groups of sequences. Reversing and sampling the resulting sequences and classifying the resulting pseudoknot types are also sub-options included in this section. The second section on the bottom of the tools tab allows the user to analyze selected secondary sequences using the tools described in Section 3.3. The tools can be used simultaneously in different combinations.",

The family Nodaviridae is comprised of two genera: alphanodaviruses and betanodaviruses. While the betanodaviruses have been isolated only from fish, the alphanodaviruses infect predominantly insects; the alphanodavirus Nodamura virus (NoV) also infects mice.

The betanodavirus genus includes many members, including the type species of the genus, Striped jack nervous necrosis virus (SJNNV), and Greasy grouper nervous necrosis virus (GGNNV).

            "text": "The nodavirus genome is divided into two segments of positive-strand RNA: RNA1 encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that replicates both genomic segments, while RNA2 encodes the precursor to the protein that comprises the viral outer coat (capsid) [42] . A small subgenomic RNA3, which is not encapsidated into viral particles, encodes a protein that suppresses host defense mechanisms like RNA interference. During viral RNA replication, the genomic RNA is copied first into a complementary negative strand, which is then used as a template for further positive-strand synthesis. The role of RNA secondary structure in the genome replication of other RNA viruses, e.g., members of the plant tombusvirus, potexvirus, and bromovirus families and the animal picornavirus, coronavirus, and flavivirus families, has been well established in the literature. For example, the RdRp of brome mosaic virus initiates negative strand synthesis at a tRNA-like structure at the 3 0 end of the positive-sense RNA template [43] . For the Nodavirus family, Kaesberg et al. [44] had previously used the method of Zuker and Stiegler [45] to perform RNA secondary structure analysis on the 3 0 noncoding regions of genomic RNA1 and RNA2 of four nodaviruses (BBV, FHV, NoV, and BoV). This method was able only to predict simple stem-loop structures and not pseudoknots. These authors predicted the presence of stem-loop structures near the 3 0 terminus of RNA2 for each of these viruses. However, the cloning and sequencing of three additional nodavirus genomes allowed us to revisit the issue of nodavirus RNA secondary structures and technical advances in the field allow us to test the effect of secondary structure on genome replication in cultured cells. The role of secondary structure on nodavirus RNA replication has been studied previously for only one member, Flock House virus. A long-range interaction between two regions of RNA1 is required for synthesis of subgenomic RNA3 [46] . The results of genetic experiments suggest that a similar long-range interaction may be also required for synthesis of the RNA3 of another member of the family, Nodamura virus (NoV) as well [47] . However, the role of RNA secondary structure in replication of nodavirus genomic RNAs remains unclear. Defining this role is crucial to understanding the mechanism of nodavirus RNA replication. The predictive approaches used in RNAVLab will greatly facilitate our molecular studies by providing a ''road map\" to elements of possible structural importance, allowing these sequences to be targeted by site-directed mutagenesis.",

By replacing the center of RNA2 with the same heterologous sequence, the work in [48] created a family of RNA molecules that differed only at their termini. The different properties of these molecules could be therefore confidently attributed to these termini. This system established a uniform assay for the different RNAs, using a single probe to the common central core region for Northern blot hybridization experiments. Since such chimeric RNA molecules replicate efficiently, they provide an ideal model substrate for secondary structure prediction and analysis.",

To address this critical question we are combining computational and experimental methods. Driven by the computational results presented in this paper, we will ultimately address the question of whether the biological relevance of the pseudoknots and stem-loops can indeed be experimentally verified. This will be accomplished using two approaches. First, to determine whether the predicted structures can be verified in solution, we will generate a nuclease map using single-and double-strand-specific ribonucleases (RNases) as described by Tuplin et al. in [49] . Viral RNA will be transcribed in vitro and treated with RNases A, T1, and V1, to cleave the 3 0 end of single-stranded uracils and cytosines, the 3 0 end of single-stranded guanines, and double-stranded nucleotides, respectively. A labeled primer will be used for reverse-transcription of the digested RNAs and sequencing of the undigested cDNA transcription templates.

Because it is technically difficult to make changes to RNA directly, we will use cloned complementary DNA (cDNA) copies of the viral genomic RNA instead. We will use site-directed mutagenesis to make specific deletions and substitutions of nucleotides within the predicted structural elements. The altered cDNAs will be introduced into cultured cells, where they will be transcribed into RNA by cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. These primary RNA transcripts will then be able to replicate in the presence of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Therefore, we will test the effect of the RNA2 mutations by transfecting the mutant form into cells together with RNA1 as a source of RdRp. Following incubation to allow the viral RNA to replicate, we will isolate total cellular RNA from the cells and assay for the presence of RNA replication products (negative strand intermediates of RNA1 and RNA2, together with production of subgenomic RNA3) using strand-specific Northern blot hybridization. For example, to test the function of the predicted stem-loop near the 3 0 end of NoV RNA2, we could delete it altogether or change specific nucleotides to disrupt base pairing interactions within the predicted stem. If these structures are important for viral RNA replication, we will observe a decrease in the level of replication products detected (relative to wild-type RNA2 controls). Together these methods will allow us to experimentally test whether the structures we predict in the RNAVLab are physically present in the viral RNAs and whether they have functional significance in the viral life cycle.",
