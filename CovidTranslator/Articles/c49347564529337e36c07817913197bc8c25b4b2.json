Cullen,VMD, PhD Liver disease is a frequently encountered problem in small animal practice. The diagnostic terminology to describe liver diseases used by pathologists from various countries and even different training programs is often inconsistent, leading to confusion for clinicians interpreting pathology reports and those who would like to compare the pathology results from separate studies. Because of these issues, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) has formed a group of experienced clinicians and pathologists to develop a standardized format for diagnostic terminology that, it is hoped, leads to greater uniformity in diagnoses and better communication between clinicians and pathologists alike. Standardized criteria and nomenclature are also mandatory for setting up multicenter clinical trials. Based on the developed system, several international studies are now getting started. The aim is to find a sound scientific basis of diagnostic and treatment protocols for hepatobiliary diseases. An overview of that monograph 1 follows.",

The liver responds to insufficient portal blood flow in a relatively stereotypic fashion regardless of the impediment to normal perfusion. Consequently, there is considerable overlap in the histologic appearance of these disorders. Typical features include absent or diminished portal vein profiles in the portal tracts; an increase in arteriolar profiles in the portal tracts and periportal sinusoidal dilation may also occur, presumably attributable to the local increased blood pressure that accompanies the arteriolar blood flow into the sinusoids (Fig. 1) . Bile duct proliferation may be evident as well. Hepatocytic atrophy is also common. Nonuniform distribution of portal flow most likely leads to irregular residual lobular architecture and the presence of abundant lipogranulomas formed from areas of hepatocyte loss, although other explanations are possible.",

Portal vein hypoplasia is a congenital vascular anomaly that occurs in dogs, and occasionally in cats, in which the intrahepatic vein and, in some circumstances, the extrahepatic portal vein are abnormally small or absent. The abnormally small or absent extrahepatic vein or intrahepatic portal vein results in diminished hepatic perfusion. There is potential for portal hypertension, along with ascites and the formation of acquired shunt vessels because of the restricted intrahepatic portal blood flow. These alterations can be present early in the course of the disease or may develop over time or not at all. Affected animals have small livers and the typical histologic pattern of portal vein hypoperfusion.

They can all be attributed to an abnormality of the development of the primordial biliary ductular system arising from the ductal plate. Congenital cystic disease is characterized by dilation of portions of the biliary tree and associated fibrosis. Lesions may affect only the large extrahepatic bile ducts in a pattern resembling Caroli's disease in human beings or may affect only the small-caliber ducts, with formation of fibrotic portal tracts and abnormal, often dilated, irregular profiles of biliary epithelial-lined ducts that can lead to extensive lesions with bridging fibrosis and associated abnormal bile ducts, diagnosed as congenital hepatic fibrosis (Fig. 2) . A third pattern is characterized by multiple unilocular or multilocular biliary cysts that range from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter and contain clear fluid (Fig. 3) . In animals affected with this form of so-called ''Von Myenburg complexes,'' discrete fibrous areas with small, often irregular, bile duct profiles are also frequently found. These lesions are often confused with benign tumors of the bile duct epithelium. Dilated renal tubules can also occur in some circumstances as well. The pattern of lesions and inheritance in domestic animals is not as clearly separated in domestic animals as it is in human beings. Persian cats are more frequently affected than other feline breeds. ",

Apoptosis is an active process of programmed cell death that results in shrinkage of the cell without loss of integrity of the cell membrane and subsequent fragmentation. Necrosis involves cytoplasmic swelling and abnormal cell membrane permeability and may result in coagulative necrosis or liquefactive necrosis. Coagulative necrosis is the result of sudden and catastrophic denaturation of the cytosolic protein and appears as swollen hepatocytes with acidophilic cytoplasm; preservation of the basic outline of the coagulated cell; and pyknosis, karyorrhexis, or karyolysis. Fig.13 . Hepatic amyloidosis in a cat. Uniformly hyaline eosinophilic material within the sinusoids distends the sinusoids and leads to atrophy of the hepatocytes that remain. Liquefactive necrosis appears as loss of hepatocytes and is the result of osmotic swelling and disintegration of hepatocytes, with subsequent collapse of the residual reticulin network or replacement by erythrocytes and, eventually, the presence of ceroid-laden macrophages. Necrosis may be followed by proliferation of Kupffer cells and infiltration of phagocytic cells, with subsequent resorption and lysis of the necrotic cells.
