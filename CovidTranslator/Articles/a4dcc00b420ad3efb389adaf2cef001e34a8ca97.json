This virus causes severe disease in humans, including acute and often lethal respiratory failure. As of January 2014, 275 cases of H7N9-infected patients had been reported, highlighting the urgency of identifying biomarkers for predicting disease severity and fatal outcomes. Here, we show that plasma levels of angiotensin II, a major regulatory peptide of the renin-angiotensin system, are markedly elevated in H7N9 patients and are associated with disease progression. Moreover, the sustained high levels of angiotensin II in these patients are strongly correlated with mortality. The predictive value of angiotensin II is higher than that of C-reactive protein and some clinical parameters such as the PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (partial pressure of arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen). Our findings indicate that angiotensin II is a biomarker for lethality in flu infections.",

Generally, the numbers of cases from single hospitals are limited and insufficient for statistical analysis 6 . As a result, no biomarker that predict disease progression and outcomes of potentially lethal flu infections has been identified 7 . During the spring of 2013, a novel and highly virulent avian-origin influenza A subtype virus, H7N9, emerged and spread among humans in Eastern China 5, [8] [9] [10] . In total, 144 people were infected by the end of 2013, and there were already over 100 newly infected patients before the end of January in 2014. Of the 111 patients we previously studied in 2013, 76.6% were admitted to an intensive care unit 1 . Among these patients, more than 70% developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 1 , which was associated with high mortality, as few interventions were available 11, 12 . Although extensive therapeutic interventions were employed, including antiviral treatments, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulins, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, continuous renal replacement therapy and artificial liver support system therapy, we observed high mortality rates among H7N9-infected patients 1, [13] [14] [15] .",

The presence of H7N9 and H1N1 influenza viruses was confirmed by PCR. Plasma from six healthy volunteers from the China CDC who were considered to be at high risk for H7N9 infection and plasma from 46 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients in Beijing were collected from April 2013 to June 2013. The characteristics of the study subjects are shown in Supplementary Tables 2-4 . To stratify the distinct time points during the illness, plasma was obtained within the first 7 days of disease onset (H7N9: n \u00bc 24; H1N1: n \u00bc 10), between 8 and 14 days following disease onset (H7N9: n \u00bc 11; H1N1: n \u00bc 7), and during the recovery phase from 15 days after disease onset (H7N9: n \u00bc 11; H1N1: n \u00bc 4) (Fig. 1a) . Intriguingly, at all stages, angiotensin II plasma levels were markedly higher in H7N9infected patients than in H1N1-infected patients, all CHD patients, and CHD patients with a diagnosis of hypertension ( Fig. 1a , Table 1, Supplementary Tables 1-4 ). Angiotensin II levels in plasma from H1N1-infected patients obtained during the first week of disease were moderately higher than in those obtained from healthy individuals, whereas angiotensin II levels in plasma obtained during other time periods from H1N1infected patients and CHD patients were not significantly different from those of high-risk healthy individuals (Fig. 1a , Supplementary Table 4) . Notably, angiotensin II levels decreased in H7N9-infected patient plasma harvested 15 days after disease onset, suggesting that angiotensin II levels may be related to disease severity in the early stage of avian influenza H7N9 infection (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table 4 ).",

We excluded samples with Ct values that indicated negative viral load. Pearson correlation analysis showed that plasma angiotensin II levels were indeed negatively correlated with H7N9 virus Ct values (and thus, positively correlated with viral load) during week 1, but not week 2 of illness (Supplementary Table 5 ). Our data suggested that elevations of angiotensin II levels in the plasmas of H7N9-infected patients harvested during week 1 of disease onset were induced by avian influenza H7N9 virus.

Although the angiotensin II levels in plasmas from H1N1-infected patients were significantly lower than those in plasmas of H7N9-infected patients, the elevations of angiotensin II levels in plasmas harvested at the first week of disease onset was induced by swine-origin influenza virus H1N1 (Supplementary Table 5 ).",

Plasma angiotensin II levels in H7N9 patients during the second week of illness demonstrated a high and significantly positive linear correlation with APACHE II scores, whereas angiotensin II levels during the first week of illness showed a weaker, albeit significant, positive linear correlation with disease severity (Fig. 2) . Again, plasma angiotensin II levels of H1N1-infected patients were positively correlated with patient APACHE II scores; however, the Spearman rank coefficient correlation did not pass hypothesis testing (Supplementary Fig. 2) . Our results suggest a potential Angiotensin II levels at week 2 can predict fatal outcomes. We further analysed whether angiotensin II levels were linked to fatal outcomes. Indeed, plasma angiotensin II levels during the second week of H7N9 illness were statistically significantly higher in the group of patients who died compared with the group who were discharged from the hospital within 28 days (Fig. 3) . Most swineorigin influenza A (H1N1) virus infections were not fatal. Among the 21 H1N1-infected patients we studied, one patient died and 19 patients were released from the hospital within 28 days. We performed biostatistical analyses to confirm angiotensin II as a biomarker of fatal outcome. We first used SPSS software to calculate its predictive value of fatal outcome (Supplementary Table 6 ). In addition to angiotensin II, we also included a biomarker for infectious disease C-reactive protein, and clinical parameters of pneumonia severity index score and SMART-COP in the analysis 23, 24 . The area under the curve of plasma angiotensin II levels during the second week of illness among H7N9-infected patients was 0.875, and the predictive values of C-reactive protein, pneumonia severity index score and SMART-COP were all less significant than angiotensin II (Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table 6 ). Our data suggested that angiotensin II level at the week 2 of disease onset could predict the fatal outcome. We also used MedCalc software and the results were the same (Supplementary Table 7 ). The sensitivity and specificity of this analysis were 87.5% and 68%, respectively (Supplementary Table 7 ).

In addition to the lack of a sufficiently sized cohort for standard statistical analysis, fatal outcomes usually result from multiorgan failure and are therefore difficult to associate with changes in a single protein in human plasma. Angiotensin II in the RAS has functions in multiple organs; it is indeed a likely biomarker that can be used to predict fatal outcome in lethal diseases. Together with our accompanying paper describing treatment options 18 , these results raise the intriguing possibility that therapies targeting RAS may represent viable strategies for treating this deadly disease. In addition to recombinant human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (in clinical trial), angiotensin II lowering drugs, including ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers, are clinically available 40, 41 . Future studies are necessary to determine the therapeutic effects of the proposed RAS targeting drugs in lethal virus infections. Measurement of angiotensin II in patient plasma. The plasma concentration of angiotensin II was measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions (RapidBio Lab, USA).
