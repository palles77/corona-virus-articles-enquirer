Analysis of a database of 335 EID events indicated that over 50% of these 'emerging' pathogens involved were bacterial, with the emergence of drug-resistant strains predominating, and over 25% were viral or prions [3] . This means that only around 10% of events were related to protozoa, whereas helminths, at a little over 3%, provided the least rattle on the EID Richter scale. Thus, from the EID perspective, parasitic infections are of relatively little significance, but that does not mean they are unimportant in terms of One Health as an approach to mitigation and control. In Figure 1 we compare some basic facts regarding MERS (an emerging viral infection) and Chagas disease (an established parasitic infection) to demonstrate that both emerging and established diseases should be considered to be significant.",

Alterations in the resilience of ecosystems and shifts in patterns of disease emergence and spread manifest themselves when we fail to recognise this relationship.

(vi) Seeking opportunities to integrate biodiversity conservation perspectives and human needs fully, including those related to domestic animal health, when developing solutions to infectious disease threats. (vii) Reducing demand for, and better regulating, the international live wildlife and bushmeat trade, not only to protect wildlife populations but also to lessen the risks of disease movement, cross-species transmission, and the development of novel pathogen-host relationships. The costs of this worldwide trade in terms of impact upon public health, agriculture, and conservation are enormous, and the global community must address this trade as the real threat it is to global socioeconomic security. (viii) Restricting the mass culling of free-ranging wildlife species for disease control to situations where there is a multidisciplinary and international scientific consensus that a wildlife population poses an urgent, significant threat to human health, food security, or wildlife health more broadly. (ix) Increasing investment in the global human and animal health infrastructure commensurately with the serious nature of emerging and resurging disease threats to people, domestic animals, and wildlife. Enhanced capacity for global human and animal health surveillance, and for clear and timely informationsharing (taking language barriers into account), can only help to improve coordination of responses among governmental and nongovernmental agencies, public and animal health institutions, vaccine/pharmaceutical manufacturers, and other stakeholders. (x) Forming collaborative relationships among governments, local people, and the private and public (i.e., non-profit) sectors to meet the challenges of global health and biodiversity conservation. (xi) Providing adequate resources and support for global wildlife health surveillance networks that exchange disease information with the public health and agricultural animal health communities as part of early warning systems for the emergence and resurgence of disease threats. (xii) Investing in educating and raising awareness worldwide and in influencing the policy process to increase recognition that we must better understand the relationships between health and ecosystem integrity to succeed in improving prospects for a healthier planet.

Although rare or unusual species of Cryptosporidium crossing between host species may perhaps be correctly described as emerging (e.g., C. ubiquitum in human infections [8] ), cryptosporidiosis is well recognised as an established cause of diarrhoea, particularly in paediatric patients. That it is no longer 'emerging' does not mean it is not a serious public health concern, as exemplified by the study of Kotloff et al. [9] , which demonstrated cryptosporidiosis to be the second most common cause of paediatric diarrhoea in various developing countries and is also associated with mortality in toddlers. Although this study [9] was able to identify the pathogens of greatest importance as a cause for paediatric diarrhoea, the One Health perspective of transmission and prevention was not considered; inclusion of this aspect in such studies, or as follow-up, could be of enormous value in countries where prevention may be a more practical approach to control than other strategies such as medication and hospital admission.",

Of the various scientific disciplines among health professionals, parasitologists have been described as being those who are most familiar with the long list of diseases in their specialty that affect both humans and animals [10] . However, as also pointed out, veterinary students tend to have far greater exposure to parasitology than do students of human medicine, largely owing to the greater volume of important parasitic infections among animals. This disparity results in considerable requirements for optimizing management in both human and animal species by utilizing One Health principles [10] . Furthermore, environmental scientists and other related non-health professionals, who nevertheless have a role to play in the One Health paradigm given the potential impacts of environmental factors on disease emergence and establishment [11] , tend to have a limited overview, at best, of parasitic infections and their zoonotic potential. This knowledge is especially crucial today with globalisation and climate change apparently on the march; pathogens that were previously geographically restricted are now able to travel further -and survive the trip -and this is especially valid for the parasites with their vast biodiversity [12, 13] .",

As a follow-up to this, a recent parasite-focus One Health workshop for medical/biomedical postgraduate students at a medical research establishment in India conducted a similar foodborne parasite ranking exercise, but at the national (Indian) rather than global level, and also discussed control options from a One Health standpoint (L.J.R. et al., unpublished). We believe that inclusion of One Health as a concept and a discussion point during parasitology sessions for medical students and veterinary students would be helpful. Simultaneously, and from the opposite angle, we believe it is important to safeguard that parasitic diseases continue to retain their place in both existing and developing One Health settings. Thus, the challenge as we see it may not be in adding parasites to the One Health bandwagon, but in ensuring that these frequently neglected infections, which are not necessarily acute but often represent an insidious burden, are not forgotten in the drama and panic surrounding other emerging zoonotic diseases that are hitting the headlines.",

To provide evidence-based knowledge about prevention and control of Taenia solium cysticercosis, we have developed a computer-based education tool: 'The Vicious Worm'.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 50 million people are infected with Taenia solium cysticercosis, causing severe headaches and epileptic seizures in humans, and great economic losses due to the condemnation of pork [1] . T. solium is considered to be the number-one foodborne parasite on a global scale [2] , and T. solium cysticercosis is among the 17 neglected tropical diseases listed by the WHO. Cysticercosis is also one of four neglected zoonoses that are now being targeted for control, elimination, and possibly eradication, as confirmed by the World Health Assembly with the adoption of resolution WHA66.12 on 23 May 2013 [3] . T. solium cysticercosis is endemic in many low-income countries of Latin America and of South and South-East Asia, and is emerging in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease has taken hold in these countries because the demand for pork is increasing, pigs are free roaming, meat inspection is either non-existent or insufficient, open defecation is highly prevalent, personal hygiene and meat hygiene are poor, and knowledge regarding T. solium cysticercosis is almost non-existent [4, 5] . Changing these unfortunate human practices will be essential for the control, elimination, and eventually eradication of the disease. Health education must therefore be included at the very beginning as a central component in any control programme.",

When planning control programmes, health education is usually included as a non-specific measure integrated with other primary health-care messages [4] .

Hence, the value of the health education per se remains unassessed [6] . Furthermore, traditional health information in the form of posters, leaflets, and other printed material is often provided in insufficient quantities and is stuck in central offices rather than being distributed to local communities or used by relevant stakeholders.",
