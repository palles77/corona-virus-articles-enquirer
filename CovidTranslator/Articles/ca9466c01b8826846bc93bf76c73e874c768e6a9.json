            "text": "One of the most important factors in decreasing mortality associated with diarrhea in calves is the proper use of oral and intravenous (IV) fluid therapy. Sick calves without significant dehydration, as seen in other diseases (eg, persistent anorexia, septicemia, ruminal acidosis from ruminal drinking, severe pneumonia, and hypothermia) also may benefit from administration of IV fluids. The recommendations for type, amount, route, and rate of administration of solutions for IV fluid therapy in calves vary and often are too complicated or not suitable for use in field practice. This article presents a simplified protocol for administration of IV fluids and a simple technique for on-farm IV fluid therapy by ear vein catheterization in calves. Recent insights in the development of metabolic acidosis in calves and studies on IV fluid therapy are reviewed.",

            "text": "Diarrhea in neonatal calves remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in North America and Europe, 1, 2 with no change in mortality rates between 1995 and 2001 in dairy heifer calves in the United States. 1 Neonatal calf diarrhea is a complex disease that occurs predominantly during the first 4 weeks of life. Calves with diarrhea have an increased chance of fecal isolation of one or more viral (rotavirus, coronavirus), bacterial (Escherichia coli, Salmonella sp.), or protozoal (Cryptosporidium parvum, Eimeria sp.) pathogens than healthy control calves. 3 Regardless of the origin, most calves with diarrhea have increased numbers of coliform bacteria in their small intestine (bacterial overgrowth), which contributes to morphologic damage of the intestinal mucosa and may result in increased susceptibility to bacteremia. 4 Metabolic acidosis is a frequent consequence of gastrointestinal disease and is found in calves with dehydration and in clinically sick calves with minimal or no signs of dehydration, the so-called ''acidosis-without-dehydration-syndrome.'' 5 The importance of bacterial overgrowth in the intestines of calves with diarrhea gained more attention when the role of D-lactate (the anion of D-lactic acid) in the development of metabolic acidosis was discovered. Production of D-lactic acid results from bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates in the gastrointestinal tract of milk-fed calves and is a common finding in sick calves with and without diarrhea. Studies have demonstrated that D-lactate is a major component of the metabolic acidosis generally present in calves with diarrhea, in calves with the ''acidosis-withoutdehydration-syndrome,'' and in calves with ruminal acidosis from drinking milk into the rumen (ruminal drinking). [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] D-lactate also has been identified as the major component of metabolic acidosis in the floppy kid syndrome of young goat kids. 16 Clinical signs of impaired central nervous system (CNS) function, including ataxia and coma in sick calves, have been historically attributed to metabolic acidosis; however, recent findings indicated that many of the clinical signs formerly attributed to acidosis are caused by an increase in D-lactate concentrations. 17, 18 The pathophysiology of D-lactate accumulation is important for bovine practitioners to understand and is discussed in more detail in the next section.",

            "text": "The pathophysiology of diarrhea includes increased intestinal secretion and decreased intestinal absorption of fluids along with increased passage of intestinal contents. Severe dehydration caused by fecal loss of fluids and electrolytes is a frequent complication of diarrhea and the primary indication for oral and intravenous fluid therapy. A higher total body water content (approximately 75% body weight) and a higher extracellular fluid volume content (approximately 45% body weight) in newborn calves make them more sensitive to fluid losses compared with adult cattle. The higher proportional water content does not serve as a water reservoir and has no protective effect against dehydration. 19 Fecal fluid loss in calves with severe watery diarrhea can reach 13% to 18% of body weight per day and is probably underestimated in most cases. 20 The highest fecal fluid loss reported was in a calf that lost 21% of its body weight over 24 hours, although ad libitum oral fluids were provided. 20 The kidneys compensate for increased fluid loss in diarrhea by decreasing urine production; however, if losses exceed fluid intake, dehydration follows. 21 Fecal losses of water occur in combination with losses of electrolytes, primarily sodium and potassium. Serum electrolyte concentrations are also affected by a reduced dietary (milk) intake and can be masked by hemoconcentration. 22 The decrease in extracellular fluid volume decreases plasma volume and venous return, which results in extracellular dehydration and total body loss of water and electrolytes. Fluid and electrolyte losses in the early stages of calf diarrhea are primarily of secretory origin andto a much lesser extent-of osmotic origin. 23 Blood electrolyte concentrations can vary considerably in calves with diarrhea because most calves generally have been treated with oral fluids before presentation. 20, [24] [25] [26] Mixing errors of oral electrolyte solutions often occur, and many calves do not have access to fresh water. 26 In dehydrated calves with diarrhea, decreased serum concentrations of glucose, sodium, potassium, and chloride have been reported. 27 Hyponatremia is generally present as a result of increased fecal loss (secretory diarrhea); 22, [27] [28] [29] however, hypernatremia also may be present. This is particularly true in calves that have been treated or overtreated with oral electrolyte solutions and do not have access to fresh water 26 or calves to which an electrolyte solution with excessive sodium concentration was fed (> 140 mEq/L). Total body potassium concentrations decrease in diarrhea; however, hyperkalemia is often present in calves with diarrhea with severe acidosis. 22, 27 Hyperkalemia is thought to result from translocation of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment. 19 An impaired renal excretion of potassium also may play a role in this not-fully-understood mechanism of hyperkalemia involving hyponatremia, hypo-osmolality, acidemia, and cellular hypoxia. 5 Calcium concentrations are often low, and magnesium concentrations vary in calves with diarrhea. 22, 30 Electrolyte imbalances (sodium, total calcium, magnesium) have been found to be present even 10 days after completion of therapy in calves that were successfully treated for diarrhea. 30 Diarrhea in young calves causes a hypo-osmotic extracellular dehydration with decreased extracellular fluid volume (plasma and interstitial) and a small increase in intracellular fluid volume. [31] [32] [33] In calves with chronic diarrhea or shortly before death, hyperosmotic dehydration may be present. 21, 34 Electrolyte disturbances and type of dehydration (iso-, hypo-, or hyperosmotic) vary among individual cases and cannot be predicted from clinical findings without laboratory analysis. Scouring calves may be in poor body condition when they have not been fed milk for several days and were treated only with oral fluids. 20, 35 Hypothermia is also a logical consequence in the pathophysiology of dehydration, and a decreased rectal temperature is frequently observed in calves with diarrhea. [36] [37] [38] The traditional recommendation for IV fluid therapy is predominantly based on the degree of dehydration. A decrease of more than 8% body weight is believed to require IV fluid administration rather than only oral fluids for successful rehydration. Under field conditions, the indications for IV fluid therapy in calves may be extended to nondehydrated sick calves with gastrointestinal or other diseases. [39] [40] [41] Calves with less severe dehydration may benefit from IV fluids if they show signs of severe depression or coma, are recumbent or severely depressed, or do not have a suckle reflex. In the authors' opinion, the indication for IV fluid therapy should be extended to some calves that may be less than 8% dehydrated. Regardless of the degree of clinical dehydration, when calves show signs of severe CNS depression or weakness, are comatose, are unable to stand, do not suckle for more than 24 hours, or have a rectal temperature of less than 100 F (38 C) (in newborn calves), IV fluid therapy is indicated. The authors recommend IV fluid therapy for other diseases or syndromes in sick calves without diarrhea, including diseases that cause a decrease in oral fluid intake because of abdominal pain or an inability to suckle, which can be seen with severe respiratory distress.",

            "text": "Development of strong ion (metabolic) acidosis is common in calves with diarrhea and other gastrointestinal diseases. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of this acidosis has increased tremendously during the past decade, primarily because of discoveries by researchers in Europe and Canada on the significance of D-lactate in calves with gastrointestinal disorders. The importance of D-lactate in the pathophysiology of gastrointestinal diseases in calves has been elucidated in several clinical and experimental studies. Two thorough review articles were published recently on this subject; 8,11 however, a brief discussion is still warranted here. We have known for years that adult ruminants with acute rumen acidosis develop D-lactic acidosis after grain overfeeding. 42 Only recently, however, were increased D-lactate concentrations identified to be responsible for most of the systemic acidemia that occurs in calves with the ''acidosis-without-dehydration syndrome'' 12, 14 and for a major portion of the acidemia seen in calves with diarrhea. 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 43 In calves with ruminal acidosis after drinking or drenching of whole milk into the rumen, acidemia may follow after absorption of sufficient amounts of D-lactate from the gastrointestinal tract. 15, 44 D-and L-lactate are end products of organic acids normally produced in the gastrointestinal tract by bacterial metabolism of carbohydrates without any deleterious consequences to the animal. 45 In adult cattle with grain overload, fermentation of Intravenous Fluid Therapy larger amounts of carbohydrates induces an increased concentration of organic acids that leads to a decrease in intraruminal pH. This decrease in pH favors the overgrowth of bacteria (mainly Lactobacillus spp.) that are able to produce D-and L-lactate in high quantities. 8 In calves with diarrhea, the increased production of D-and probably L-lactate is thought to result from villous atrophy, with subsequent malabsorption and fermentation of nutrients by intestinal bacteria. 8, 11 Both the L-and D-isomers of lactic acid can be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract; however, the hepatic metabolism and renal excretion of D-lactate are significantly slower in ruminants compared with L-lactate. With increased production and absorption of L-and D-lactate, the metabolic acidosis that develops is primarily caused by increases in D-lactate concentrations. 8 Development of metabolic acidosis in calves with diarrhea has long been attributed to (1) loss of bicarbonate ions (HCO 3 -) in the feces, (2) decreased renal excretion of hydrogen ions (H 1 ) associated with dehydration and decreased renal blood flow, and (3) the presence of unidentified organic acids in plasma. [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] In the late 1980s, Naylor 51 found that metabolic acidosis is based at least in part on the presence of increased L-lactate concentrations in the serum of calves with diarrhea younger than 8 days. Compared with the recent findings of elevated D-lactate concentrations in the blood, however, the small increases in L-lactate concentrations seen in earlier studies do not explain the high anion-gap (AG 5 ([",

            "text": "The first two reports of D-lactic acidosis from France found a mean D-lactate concentration between 10 and 13 mmol/L in the plasma of clinically sick Charolais calves without signs of dehydration or diarrhea and a mean D-lactate concentration of 5 mmol/L in calves with simple diarrhea. This finding was compared with healthy control calves that had D-lactate concentrations between 1 and 2 mmol/L. 12, 14 The mean L-lactate concentrations seen in acidotic calves (1-2.5 mmol/L) were much lower than the reported D-lactate levels. Subsequent studies from Canada and Germany showed that hyper-D-lactatemia is often present in calves with more severe diarrhea and dehydration. A blood D-lactate concentration above 3 mmol/L was found in 55% of 300 calves with neonatal diarrhea. 9 Median D-lactate concentration was 4.1 mmol/L and ranged from 0 to 17.8 mmol/L. The correlation between D-lactate concentration and base deficit was statistically significant but not linear, and the degree to which D-lactate contributed to metabolic acidosis varied from calf to calf (Fig. 1) . Calves with a severe metabolic acidosis (base deficit > 25 mmol/L) always had increased D-lactate concentrations, whereas calves with a less severe acidosis (base deficit between 10 and 25 mmol/L) had D-lactate concentrations that varied from 0 to 17.8 mmol/L. 9, 10 The concentration of D-lactate and L-lactate accounted for 64% of the elevated anion gap in one study, 13 and significant correlations between D-lactate concentration and the anion gap were found in subsequent studies. 6, 9 Ewaschuk and colleagues 7 measured D-and L-lactate in rumen, blood, fecal, and urine samples in calves with diarrhea and in healthy control calves. Despite a markedly higher L-lactate concentration in rumen and fecal samples of diarrheic calves as compared with control calves, the L-lactate concentrations were not high enough to induce a systemic acidosis. The calves with diarrhea in that study had significantly higher values for D-lactate in all four samples (rumen, feces, blood, urine) than healthy control calves. 7 The mean values for D-lactate were highest in the feces (25.4 mmol/L), followed by urine (19.2 mmol/L), rumen (17 mmol/L), and serum (13.9 mmol/L). The authors concluded that D-lactate production and absorption in the colon were more likely to have contributed to the systemic acidosis than other possible sites of absorption (rumen). Accumulated D-lactate may be effectively eliminated by the kidneys in nondehydrated calves. 54 The role of IV fluid therapy to restore or maintain hydration status in sick calves is also important to speed elimination of D-lactate; however, kinetic studies of D-lactate elimination in calves are not currently available.",

Grain overload leads to production of short chain fatty acids and large amounts of D-and L-lactate. 8 Because the ruminant liver is not efficient in metabolizing D-lactate, it begins to accumulate in the blood and systemic acidemia often follows. The same absorptive mechanisms for D-lactate in ruminating cattle may be responsible for systemic accumulation of D-lactate in preruminating calves with persistent ruminal acidosis from spilling milk into the rumen (ruminal drinking). 15 Experimentally induced rumen acidosis in calves after repeated intraruminal force feeding of whole milk resulted in D-lactic acidosis. Calves developed hyper-D-lactatemia with concentrations between 6.8 and 11.1 mmol/L, generally in conjunction with metabolic acidosis, dehydration, severe depression, and lack of appetite or reduced suckle reflex. 15 Calves that suffered from spontaneous diarrhea and concurrent ruminal acidosis (rumen pH < 6.0) had a higher mean D-lactate concentration (6.6 AE 5.2 mmol/L) in blood as compared with calves with a normal rumen pH (5.3 AE 5.4 mmol/L). 9 The author stated that her study could not clarify whether the ruminal acidosis was a cause or a consequence of systemic D-lactic acidosis.",

D-lactic acidosis occurs after sufficient amounts of D-lactate have been absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (primarily colon) and neutralization of the accumulated D-lactate by buffer mechanisms in the body becomes inadequate. Reports of D-lactate concentrations in calves with diarrhea that are being fed milk-replacer diets with or without antimicrobials are unavailable, so it is unknown whether these calves develop D-lactic acidosis to the same degree as calves on whole milk diets.",

The predictive accuracy of the degree of metabolic acidosis on the basis of clinical signs has varied among studies. The clinical signs of neurologic depression (weakness, ataxia, and decreased menace, suckle, and panniculus reflex) correlated highly with the severity of metabolic acidosis in calves without dehydration. 52 Also in calves with diarrhea, signs of CNS depression, ability to stand, and suckling force all correlated well with metabolic acidosis. 36, 51, 64, 65 The degree of enophthalmos and peripheral skin temperature are important and obvious signs that determine whether IV fluid therapy is indicated; however, they do not correlate with the degree of metabolic acidosis. 10, 24, 28, 36, 51, 52 An important discovery was that metabolic acidosis in calves with diarrhea varies during the first weeks of life. Naylor discovered that metabolic acidosis is less severe during the first week of life than in calves with diarrhea older than 8 days. 36, 51 The base deficit in calves with diarrhea that were older than 1 week was almost twice as high as in calves that presented with diarrhea during the first week of life. Subsequent studies confirmed that calves with diarrhea older than 1 week of age usually exhibit a higher base deficit. 24, 25, 50, 66, 67 On the basis of his findings, Naylor 68 developed a chart for predicting the severity of metabolic acidosis based on body position, strength of suckle reflex, and age of the calf, with corresponding values for base deficit and bicarbonate requirements for the treatment of metabolic acidosis in calves with diarrhea younger or older than 8 days. This protocol became a popular approach to guide diagnosis and treatment of acidosis in calves with diarrhea and is presented in common veterinary medical textbooks. An even more simplified approach to fluid therapy in the field is presented later in this article.",

Calves that are unable to stand or have a weak or absent suckle reflex have a more severe acidosis and require intravenous sodium bicarbonate to correct their acidemia. D-lactic acidosis may be present in sick calves with or without diarrhea and dehydration that are recumbent or wobbly, tired, listless or comatose, and have a delayed, incomplete, or absent palpebral reflex. If the suckle reflex is absent or weak or the calf chews irregularly instead of suckling normally, D-lactic acidosis may be the underlying disease state. Clinical assessment for weakness and ability to stand is performed by careful manipulation to help calves stand up (not performed in comatose calves), for duration of anorexia by obtaining history and determining suckle reflex, and for hypothermia by palpation of extremities and recording rectal temperature.",

An estimated dehydration of more than 8% of the calf's body weight is the most widely accepted indication for IV fluid administration, 73 although experimental evidence supporting this as the most appropriate intervention point is currently unavailable. One study demonstrated that calves dehydrated more than 8% required at least 24 hours to be adequately rehydrated with orally administered electrolyte solutions. 74 Calves that are recumbent, severely depressed, or comatose and calves without a suckle reflex also need IV fluid therapy. Calves with rapidly progressing dehydration and consistent profuse watery diarrhea should be treated intravenously rather than rehydrated by ororuminal intubation. If treatment with oral fluids is not successful and only a weak suckle reflex is present, initial IV restoration of fluid and electrolyte deficits is preferred. Collapsed dehydrated calves in severe hypovolemic shock are not able to rapidly resorb sufficient amounts of oral or subcutaneously administered fluids and should receive IV rehydration. 74 Resuscitation by IV fluid administration restores oxygen delivery and removes the metabolic products of poorly perfused tissues. 60 IV fluids are also recommended in sick calves that show signs of CNS depression and other underlying diseases. [39] [40] [41] Severely depressed calves with suspected acidemia (most likely D-lactic acidosis) but without clinical signs of dehydration need IV alkalinizing fluids to restore a normal acid-base status. 14,52,70 Severely depressed calves with acidemia need IV alkalinizing fluids to help to decrease D-lactate concentrations. 5, 14 The authors also recommend IV fluid therapy for other diseases or syndromes in sick calves without diarrhea but with a decrease in oral fluid intake from pain or inability to suckle caused by severe respiratory distress. Finally, IV fluid therapy is needed for resuscitation of newly born calves that suffer from asphyxia and mixed respiratory-metabolic acidosis. 56, 57 ",

This goal was defined by Naylor and colleagues 5 after D-lactate was identified as an important factor of metabolic acidosis that acts as a neurotoxic agent. The reduction of D-lactate helps to correct depression and restore the suckle reflex. Current research efforts concentrate on the development and evaluation of efficient strategies to decrease D-lactate concentrations. 43, 54, 75 The administration of IV fluids may speed renal elimination of D-lactate and removal from body compartments such as the brain and CSF. 54 Administration of IV sodium bicarbonate in calves with D-lactic acidosis had no significant effect on blood D-lactate concentrations 4 hours after starting buffer therapy and did not correct the base deficit in 53% of calves, despite correct calculation of bicarbonate requirements. 43 After 24 hours, the mean D-lactate concentration decreased from 10 mmol/L before therapy to 5.4 mmol/L with administration of sodium bicarbonate followed by isotonic saline. Whether IV fluid therapy alone is sufficient to reduce the D-lactate levels found in acidotic calves with diarrhea is questionable. Administration of oral electrolyte solutions with a high strong ion difference for at least 2 days may help hasten the renal excretion of D-lactate and avoid relapses. A Canadian study reported significant reductions of D-lactate concentrations within 24 hours after starting a treatment protocol with a combination of IV fluids, oral electrolytes, and antibiotics. 75 This study examined the effects of orally administered Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, a probiotic bacteria that does not produce D-lactate. Unfortunately, the probiotic had no effect on D-lactate levels in serum and feces. The exact treatment plan was not presented in this study; however, combining IV buffer therapy and oral electrolytes with antibiotics seems logical for the treating D-lactic acidosis in calves with diarrhea and preventing relapses by controlling bacterial D-lactate production in the gastrointestinal tract with antimicrobials. A study from France suggested milk withdrawal for a short period combined with administration of antibiotics for the treatment of D-lactic acidosis in addition to administration of sodium bicarbonate. 14 Further studies are desperately needed to evaluate the efficacy of various treatment protocols in calves with D-lactic acidosis.",

Sodium is the backbone of the extracellular fluid, and solutions based on sodium are always indicated in hypovolemia. 80 To increase or maintain the extracellular volume, isotonic solutions (approximately 300 mOsm/L) must contain a sodium concentration of at least 140 mEq/L. Solutions that contain less sodium do not resuscitate dehydrated calves as effectively as isotonic saline that has a sodium concentration of 154 mEq/L. 81 Sodium-containing solutions should not be used in calves with severe hypoalbuminemia because they decrease plasma albumin concentration and oncotic pressure, which forces fluid movement into the interstitial space and exacerbates tissue edema. 80 Calves known to have hypoalbuminemia before the start of IV fluid therapy benefit from the administration of colloid solutions or blood transfusion.",

            "text": "Because acidemia is common in calves with gastrointestinal disease requiring IV fluid therapy, these patients need administration of alkalinizing substances. 82 Sodium bicarbonate is the alkalinizing agent of choice and is often recommended as a 1.3% isotonic solution (13 g NaHCO 3 /L). 66, 73, 80, [83] [84] [85] Isotonic sodium bicarbonate has an effective strong ion difference of 155 mEq/L and is alkalinizing because it buffers hydrogen ions and increases the strong ion difference in blood. Many studies have documented that sodium bicarbonate is the most important buffer for the treatment of acidemia in calves with and without dehydration. Available hypertonic preparations of sodium bicarbonate include 4.2%, 5%, and 8.4% solutions with a theoretic osmolality of 1000 mOsm/L, 1190 mOsm/L, and 2000 mOsm/L, respectively. Hypertonic formulations of sodium bicarbonate are ideal for adding to larger quantities of isotonic saline to create a mildly hypertonic solution containing volume-expanding fluid and buffer. 39, 66, 78 Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3 ) is available in 100-mL or 250-mL glass bottles as 4.2% or 8.4% hypertonic formulations, which provides for easy calculation of the volumes for buffer requirements because 1 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate provides 1 mEq of buffer (HCO 3 -). One or two (250 mL) bottles of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate can easily be added to a 5 L bag of isotonic saline with a large syringe and mixed on the farm just before administration to avoid potential contamination. 39, 66 In North America, 500-mL bottles of 5% sodium bicarbonate are widely available and contain 0.6 mEq of HCO 3 per milliliter (298 mEq per bottle). Administration of undiluted 4.2% or 2.1% sodium bicarbonate has been recommended at a dosage Intravenous Fluid Therapy of 500 mL to 1000 mL for resuscitation of comatose or severely acidotic calves before starting a volume-expanding or replacement solution. 35 Administration of undiluted 8.4% hypertonic sodium bicarbonate solution should be used with caution, especially in dehydrated calves that are unable to suckle. Potential adverse effects of hypertonic sodium bicarbonate include hyperosmolality of extracellular fluid, hypokalemia, hypernatremia, hypocalcemia, and paradoxic intracellular and CSF acidosis. A recent study administered 8.4% hypertonic sodium bicarbonate (10 mL/kg over 8 minutes) or 5.85% hypertonic saline solution (5 mL/kg over 4 minutes) followed by oral electrolytes to dehydrated calves with diarrhea and severe acidosis. 67 Administration of 8.4% hypertonic sodium bicarbonate resulted in greater cure rates as compared with hypertonic saline. Although no significant clinical side effects were observed, the authors warned against using hypertonic (high sodium) solutions in calves with hypernatremia. 67 Hypertonic sodium bicarbonate should not be used in calves with diarrhea that have concurrent respiratory disease, because they may not be able to effectively exhale the excess CO 2 generated in buffer reactions.",

Acetate would not exacerbate D-and L-lactic acidosis. 64 A disadvantage of commercially available acetated Ringer's solutions is that it contains gluconate, which is slowly metabolized by neonatal calves. 87 Despite these concerns, lactated Ringer's solution is popular and still widely used by practitioners.

Catheterization of the jugular vein is still widely used for fluid therapy in calves and adult cattle. 35, 78 Other routes for administration of fluids in cattle have been presented but are not considered in this article. Schmid and R\u00fc sse 89 were the first to describe the technique of auricular vein catheterization in neonatal calves using a small flexible catheter, and the method quickly became popular among practitioners in Germany and other countries. [90] [91] [92] Even in severely dehydrated calves, ear vein catheterization is possible, and a surgical cutdown of the jugular vein (which is often performed in severely dehydrated calves) can be avoided. Ear catheters allow the administration of adequate volumes of fluids by continuous drip infusion to calves. 73, 91, 93, 94 Despite the lack of studies comparing the use of ear vein catheters with other approaches in calves, this technique is believed to result in fewer complications compared with jugular catheters. 95 In pigs, long-term ear vein catheterization for 7 to 14 days was superior to jugular catheterization. 96 In this study, jugular vein catheters occluded more often and caused thrombophlebitis, whereas ear catheters showed no reactions. A study that evaluated the use of auricular vein catheters in adult cattle stated that this technique is easy to perform, safe, and less expensive because fewer catheters need to be discarded. 91 The ear vein approach initially should be practiced in calves with minimal or no dehydration before trying to catheterize severely dehydrated calves. Initially, it may be difficult to place a catheter into the ear of a severely dehydrated calf with a collapsed and small auricular vein. Blocking the vein with a tourniquet becomes essential for proper placement of the catheter. Small rubber bands are recommended and usually fit well around the base of the ear. To achieve better distention and visualization of the ear vein, gauze soaked with warm water can be applied to the ear for a short period of time to increase regional blood flow. The catheterization site needs to be shaved or clipped and prepared aseptically with iodine or alcohol before catheter insertion. The alcohol or iodine solution also acts as a lubricant and aids the advancement of the catheter into the ear. Lidocaine anesthesia of the venipuncture site is not necessary and is not recommended for ear vein catheterization. Subcutaneous administration of lidocaine creates a fluid bubble, which makes the vein difficult to visualize. Mild sedation with xylazine is occasionally necessary in vigorous calves that do not have any CNS depression; however, xylazine is not needed and should be avoided in severely dehydrated calves with hypovolemic shock because it further decreases blood pressure and causes the ear vein to collapse.",

            "text": "Current recommendations for ear vein catheterization in neonatal calves are to use a 22 gauge, 1-in (0.9 \u00c2 25 mm) over-the-needle catheter (ie, Vasocan Braun\u00fc le, B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen, Germany) with a butterfly-shaped wing. Other suitable catheters for ear vein catheterization should incorporate a guide wire needle to facilitate easier placement. Older calves and adult cattle require larger gauge sizes for increased flow rates. A disadvantage of the over-the-needle catheters is that they may fray or splinter at the tip during insertion and then must be discarded. Advancing an already frayed catheter should be avoided because it damages the internal wall of the vein and increases the risk of thrombosis. 97 The anatomy of the ear veins may differ slightly among calves. Normally there are one or two cranial, one medial, and one caudal ear vein that are large enough for catheterization. Identification of the ear vessels is important to avoid arterial puncture or placement of the catheter into the auricular artery. This artery is located between the cranial ear vein and the medial ear vein. It is usually more prominent than the ear veins and is visible even before applying a tourniquet. Identification of the auricular artery by palpating for a pulse is difficult; however, the artery feels harder than the veins and can be rolled under the skin. The author prefers the cranial ear vein for catheterization (Fig. 3A) followed by the medial vein. The cranial vein runs dorsally across the auricular pinna, which is flatter and more rigid than the caudal part of the ear. Catheterization should begin as far distally as possible to allow for repeated attempts more proximally if the first attempt is not successful. If the tip of the catheter lies too close to the base of the ear, the fluid flow rate may be slow.",

An ear vein catheter can be left in place for several days without significant complications. In the authors' experience, calves with ear catheters left in place for up to 7 days had only minor swelling with no evidence of thrombophlebitis. Most catheters can be removed by the producer after 2 days if the calf is able to suckle and maintain a normal hydration status. Changing ear catheters is not needed as often as compared with jugular catheters. 91 Although it tends to be a common criticism of ear vein catheters, slow fluid flow rates are almost never a problem; however, ear catheters do tend to occlude more than jugular catheters. 91 ",

Values calculated from blood gas analysis multiply base deficit with body weight and with a factor that considers the volume of distribution for bicarbonate ions in the body (0.5-0.6) according to the following formula: 51, 101 Bicarbonate requirement \u00bdmEq 5 body weight \u00bdkg \u00c2 base deficit \u00bdmEq=L \u00c2 0:5 \u00c0 0:6 \u00bdL=kg Values above 1.0 for calculating bicarbonate requirements have been reporteda finding that was attributed to ongoing fecal and renal losses of bicarbonate, along with ongoing production of organic acids in the gastrointestinal tract. 50 Another study recommended a distribution factor of 1.0 to consider the ongoing losses that accompany diarrhea. 93 Values of 1.0 or more seem much too high to be used to correct existing deficits as supported by a report from Japan, which found a much lower distribution factor of bicarbonate (0.367) in dehydrated calves with diarrhea. 84 More recent research showed that calves with acidemia from D-lactic acidosis need more sodium bicarbonate to buffer the metabolic acidosis and to decrease D-lactate concentration below 3 mmol/L. 43 Practitioners must rely on clinical signs and the guidelines developed by Naylor based on standing ability, suckling force, and age of calves with diarrhea to predict if alkalinizing therapy is indicated and how much isotonic sodium bicarbonate should be administered. Because determining the severity of acidosis on the farm is difficult and costly, buffer administration is commonly done without any laboratory data. The clinical response of the calf to IV fluid therapy must be monitored. Urination within 30 to 60 minutes, improvement of mental and hydration status, and, most importantly, restoration of the suckle reflex are monitored as responses to treatment. 78, 102 Recumbent calves should stand within a few hours of IV fluid therapy. If the suckle reflex does not return after IV buffer therapy, other diseases, such as septicemia, omphalitis, or pneumonia, should be ruled out. 103 An easy but successful guideline for the treatment of severely dehydrated calves with diarrhea and acidosis is administration of isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution at approximately 10% body weight over a period of several hours. 94 This protocol had a success rate of 91% without calculating buffer requirements, fluid rates, or maintenance requirements. Ninety calves with a mean base deficit of \u00c019.0 AE 3.8 mEq/L (pH 7.06 AE 0.22) received approximately 10% of their body weight as isotonic sodium bicarbonate solution (1.26% 5 12.6 g/L instead of the more widely used 1.3%). The first half was given rapidly over 2 to 3 hours, which equals an administration rate of approximately 20 mL/kg/h. After 3 hours, when approximately 5% body weight of isotonic sodium bicarbonate had been infused, 77% of the calves were able to suckle water again. Milk replacer was continuously fed in that study; however, oral electrolytes were not given. Additional replacement therapy with 2 to 4 L of Ringer's or isotonic sodium chloride was given to 16 calves. 94 Another practical technique for a 40-to 50-kg, severely dehydrated and comatose calf is to give 2 L of isotonic sodium bicarbonate rapidly and then switch fluid to an isotonic mixture of sodium chloride and sodium bicarbonate. 104 A Simplified Protocol for Farm Intravenous Fluid Therapy A simplified protocol for IV fluid therapy by ear vein catheterization in calves used in the authors' practice is presented in this section. Calves are examined for dehydration by evaluating the eyeball position within the orbit, for weakness and ability to stand by careful manipulation (not performed in comatose calves), for duration of anorexia by obtaining history and determining suckle reflex, and for hypothermia by palpating extremities and oral cavity and obtaining rectal temperature.",

It is difficult to perform long-term (maintenance) IV fluid therapy without fluid line problems in an unobserved calf. When the calf begins moving freely in its stall, the infusion line can be coiled and is often occluded after bending. Complications with maintaining a permanent fluid line can be reduced by using coiled infusion sets, self-retractable dog leashes, or elastic bands 92 to which the infusion line is taped.

An infusion rate slower than 80 mL/kg/h is preferred to avoid overhydration and development of pulmonary, interstitial, or cerebral edema. Anemia and hypoproteinemia also may follow overhydration, leading to hypoxia if the packed cell volume falls below 15%. Formation of interstitial edema Intravenous Fluid Therapy occurs if total protein concentrations drop below 4 mg/dL. 95 To the authors' knowledge, these complications have not been reported in the literature of calves and may be overlooked because of lack of observation on the farm. It seems unlikely that severe overhydration of calves would occur with flow rates that can be accomplished through a small (22-gauge) ear vein catheter, however.",

Potential adverse effects of IV fluid administration on serum concentration of electrolytes, enzymatic activities, and voluntary intake of milk or oral electrolytes have not been investigated extensively. One study reported that the administration of isotonic sodium bicarbonate in calves with diarrhea was followed by a decrease in concentrations of potassium, magnesium, total calcium, and ionized calcium. 22 The clinical significance of these findings is unknown, and the authors did not recommend any treatments other than the administration of sodium bicarbonate or calcium. 22 In newborn calves with a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis (birth asphyxia), the administration of a hypertonic 5% sodium bicarbonate solution was followed by a decrease in total calcium concentration; however, concentrations of potassium, magnesium, and inorganic phosphorus were not affected 120 minutes after treatment. 57 A study on the long-term effects of neonatal diarrhea and its treatment with IV sodium bicarbonate, glucose, and electrolyte solutions followed by oral electrolytes found significantly lower serum concentrations of sodium, magnesium, and total calcium up to 10 days after the last treatment was administered compared with healthy control calves. 30 Base excess values of treated calves were significantly lower than those found in healthy control calves, and potassium concentrations were lower, although not statistically significant.",
