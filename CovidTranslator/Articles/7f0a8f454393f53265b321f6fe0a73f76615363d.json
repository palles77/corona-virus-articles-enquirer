While many aspects of host-pathogen interactions during the course of an influenza infection have been studied, there is less informa-tion on the host response during the repair stage of an infection (Mizgerd, 2008) .

Through the combined action of innate and adaptive immune responses, the infectious pathogen becomes inactivated and cleared from the body, repair processes start to resolve the tissue damage, and long-term immunity is ultimately established. However, excessive and prolonged inflammation may be detrimental to the host and contribute to the greater morbidity and mortality associated with influenza-induced inflammatory injury (Akaike et al., 1996; Monsalvo, 2010; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005; Buchweitz et al., 2007) . Exaggerated inflammatory responses in the lung parenchyma can destroy alveoli, induce excessive edema, precipitate hypoxia, and cause pulmonary impairment (Narasaraju et al., 2011) . Studies have documented that inflammatory injury to the lungs represents a major factor for the fatalities associated with pandemic H1N1-2009, highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Monsalvo, 2010; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005) . Although inflammatory processes represent important therapeutic targets, anti-inflammatory therapies may also inhibit critical immune functions that mediate pathogen clearance, and they run the risk of enhancing pathogen replication and secondary infection (Uchide and Toyoda, 2011; Snelgrove et al., 2006; Aldridge et al., 2009; Ballinger and Standiford, 2010) . An ideal treatment regimen should minimize the tissue damage caused by inflammation and facilitate recovery without interfering with the host's antiviral and antibacterial responses.",

ANGPTL4 undergoes proteolytic processing by proprotein convertases at the linker region, thereby releasing the N-terminal region (nANGPTL4) and the monomeric C-terminal portion (cANGPTL4) (Zhu et al., 2012; Grootaert et al., 2012) . The nANGPTL4 assembles into oligomeric structures, which is important for its function as a lipoprotein lipase inhibitor (Lei et al., 2011; Dijk and Kersten, 2014) . The cANGPTL4 interacts with integrin b1/5, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, or claudin-5 to trigger intracellular pathways that aid wound healing and support tumor growth and metastasis (Goh et al., 2010a (Goh et al., , 2010b Huang et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011) . The expression of ANGPTL4 is elevated by numerous stimuli that are also involved in influenza pneumonia, including glucocorticoids, transforming growth factor b, and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-a (HIF1-a) (Zhu et al., 2012; Grootaert et al., 2012) .

The infection was performed via intratracheal inoculation with a nonlethal PR8 viral challenge that was sufficient to cause serious pulmonary damage. Viral replication was detected on bronchial structures at 3 days postinfection (dpi) and peaked at 5 dpi, as indicated by the presence of NS1 viral protein ( Figure 1A ). Virus was also detected in alveolar type II epithelial cells throughout the lungs by coimmunofluorescence staining with surfactant protein C ( Figure 1B ). At day 7, the viral protein expression began to decrease, and it became undetectable at 9 dpi ( Figure 1A) . The viral replication profile during the disease progression was further confirmed by qPCR of viral nucleoprotein RNA from infected lungs ( Figure 1C ). In addition, the expression of interferon-g (IFN-g) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), cytokines critical for innate and adaptive immunity against viral infections, peaked at 5 dpi ( Figure 1C ). H&E staining of infected lung sections revealed that bronchial cells were damaged at 5 dpi, corresponding to the peak of viral load ( Figure S1A ). We observed extensive lung tissue damage that was marked by large regions of pulmonary hemorrhage and infiltration of host immune cells at 13 dpi ( Figure S1A ). Inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, infiltrated the alveolar spaces of infected lungs, causing tissue damage and bleeding ( Figure S1B ). Together with damaged tissue debris, the infiltrated cells formed dense cell clusters and filled up the alveolar spaces. In our model, the mice recovered from the infection, which allowed us to investigate the events that occurred during the recovery phase. Indeed, overall recovery of tissue integrity was observed at 19 dpi ( Figure S1A ).",

            "text": "Next, we determined the kinetics of ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein levels in the infected lungs by qPCR and immunoblot analyses, respectively. ANGPTL4 mRNA was significantly upregulated at day 5 and remained elevated until 9 dpi. Thereafter, its expression decreased, reaching the basal level by 17 dpi (Figure 1D ). Elevated levels of ANGPTL4 protein, specifically cANGPTL4, were detected in lung tissue homogenates at day 7 and remained elevated until 19 dpi, compared to day 0 controls ( Figure 1E ). We also examined the spatiotemporal expression of cANGPTL4 during influenza infection by immunofluorescence staining ( Figure 1F ). At day 0, cANGPTL4 protein was restricted to tubular structures such as the blood vessels and bronchioles ( Figure 1F ). At 5 and 13 dpi, corresponding to the peaks of ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein respectively, we observed stronger cANGPTL4 staining within the inflamed regions infiltrated by immune cells ( Figure 1F ). To eliminate the possible interference from autofluorescence, we provided technical controls for the staining using isotype immunoglobulin G (IgG) control and Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescence antibody. Both the blood vessels and infiltrated alveolar space showed positive staining with anti-cANGPTL4 mouse monoclonal antibody as the primary antibody and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 as the secondary antibody. In contrast, no staining of the blood vessel and infiltrated alveolar space at the corresponding regions in neighboring slide was observed when control IgG and anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 antibody were used ( Figure S1C ). The result confirmed the ANGPTL4 signal was specific. To confirm that the elevated cANGPTL4 expression was not virus-strain specific, we examined its expression in the lungs of mice challenged with a sublethal dose of a mouse-adapted H3N2 strain. H3N2 infection of BALB/c mice exhibited increased levels of cANGPTL4 as well as full-length ANGPTL4. The cANGPTL4 protein peaked at 10 dpi, while the expression of native ANGPTL4 protein remained elevated at 15 dpi during the recovery of lung tissues (Figures S1D and S1E). This confirmed that ANGPTL4 upregulation was not restricted to a specific strain of influenza virus or mouse. Notably, different strains of virus and mouse showed distinct ANGPTL4 mRNA and protein expression profiles.",

Although Clara cells were also stained positive for ANGPTL4 ( Figure S2A ), we did not detect any significant ANGPTL4 mRNA level in Clara cells isolated by laser capture microdissection ( Figure S2B ), suggesting that the ANGPTL4 staining most likely derived from secretion from heterotypic cell types.

            "text": "We next sought to elucidate the underlying mechanism of this upregulation. HIF1-a has been shown to increase the expression of ANGPTL4 in endothelial cells (Zhu et al., 2012; Grootaert et al., 2012) . To investigate if HIF1-a could be responsible for the expression of ANGPTL4 mRNA, we examined the HIF1-a protein expression profile in our animal model. The peak HIF1-a protein expression was detected at 13 dpi, which did not coincide with the peak mRNA expression of ANGPTL4 ( Figure S2C) , suggesting HIF1-a was unlikely to be a major regulator of ANGPTL4 at the early stages of infection. However, we cannot exclude that HIF1-a may maintain or sustain ANGPTL4 expression at later stages of infection. Interrogation of GEO data sets revealed that STAT3 deficiency in pulmonary alveolar type II epithelial cells was related to lower ANGPTL4 levels (Xu et al., 2007) . Interestingly, viral infection triggered host responses through IFN-g and IL-6 pathways, which activate STAT, and displayed overlapping profiles to the ANGPTL4 mRNA expression pattern ( Figure 1C ). In silico analysis of the promoter of the mouse ANGPTL4 gene also revealed a putative STAT-binding site ( Figure 2C ). Thus, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using phospho-STAT3 (pSTAT3) antibody on the ANGPTL4 promoter in uninfected and infected lung tissues. The sequences spanning the STAT-binding site were enriched in the immunoprecipitates obtained from the virus-infected lung tissues compared to uninfected tissues (Figure 2D ). pSTAT3 ChIP experiments followed by re-ChIP with p300, a STAT3 coactivator, further confirmed the existence of direct regulation of ANGPTL4 via a STAT3-mediated mechanism ( Figure 2D ). To further strengthen our in vivo findings, we suppressed endogenous STAT3 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and examined the expression of ANGPTL4 in a human small airway epithelial cell culture exposed to IL-6. We observed a significant increase in ANGPTL4 mRNA in response to an IL-6 challenge, which was abrogated when endogenous STAT3 was knocked down by ON-TARGETPlus siRNA (Figure S2D) . We confirmed that the STAT3 protein was also reduced by western blot analysis ( Figure S2D ).",

To determine whether furin-like activity is present and consistent with the peak of cANGPTL4 protein expression in influenza-infected lungs, we measured furin activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice that were sublethally infected with PR8 virus. Furin activity in the BALF started to increase at 5 dpi, coinciding with the peak in virus titer ( Figure 2E) . Importantly, the furin activity profile overlapped significantly with that of cANGPTL4 protein ( Figure 2E ). To strengthen the role of furin in ANGPTL4 cleavage, we performed similar experiments in the presence or absence of a furin inhibitor. Furin inhibitor was added to BALF taken from 11 dpi, a time point when the furin activity was elevated. Recombinant flANGPTL4 protein with FLAG tag at the C terminus was used as exogenous substrate. We detected a reduced cANGPTL4:flANGPTL4 ratio in BALF containing furin inhibitor when compared to BALF alone (Figure S2E ), confirming that furin was a major contributor of posttranslational cleavage of flANGPTL4 in our animal model. Taken together, our data demonstrated that ANGPTL4 mRNA was upregulated via a STAT3-dependent pathway during influenza pneumonia. The concomitant increase in furin activity subsequently cleaved flANGPTL4 to generate cANGPTL4, which peaked at 13 dpi, corresponding to extensive lung injury marked by large regions of pulmonary hemorrhage and infiltration of host immune cells.",

We employed two treatment strategies based on the stage of disease progression ( Figure 3A ). Virus-induced inflammation caused severe lung damage, which was observed until 13 dpi. Thereafter, tissue regeneration began to restore lung structural integrity and function. Thus, we defined the period before 13 dpi as the ''damage window,'' and days after 13 dpi as the ''recovery window.'' Daily intravenous injections of anti-ANGPTL4 mAb (10 mg/kg body weight) were administered for 5 days starting either at 6 dpi during the damage window or day 13 during the recovery period ( Figure 3A ). Negative control groups included mock-infected mice that received either isotype-matched control mouse IgG or anti-cANGPTL4 mAb alone. Mice infected with influenza virus and treated with control mouse IgG served as another control group. Lung tissues were harvested 24 hr after the last injection.",

See also Figure S2 . we examined the in vivo integrity of the pulmonary vasculature by in vivo imaging of the mice receiving anti-cANGPTL4 mAb during the recovery period ( Figure 3E ). Mice were injected intravenously with IRDye 800CW PEG contrast agent (50 nmol/kg body weight) 24 hr after the last mAb injection. The presence of infrared (IR) signal indicates the accumulation of IRDye 800CW PEG in tissue due to increased leakiness of the local tissue. As expected, infected mice treated with control IgG showed a very high IR signal in the lung compared to mock-infected mice ( Figure 3E ). Infected mice treated with anti-cANGPTL4 mAb showed a significantly subdued IR signal in the lungs compared with control IgG treatment, indicating that immunoneutralization of cANGPTL4 markedly abrogated tissue leakiness. Ex vivo imaging of resected mouse lungs confirmed the reduced accumulation of IRDye 800CW PEG agent following anti-cANGPTL4 mAb therapy. To more precisely define the cell types responsible for the increased tissue leakiness, we examined the cell-cell junction of human small airway epithelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells after treatment with recombinant cANGPTL4 by immunofluorescence staining with tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). The cANGPTL4 protein perturbed the cellcell boundary of primary human endothelial and epithelial cells ( Figure 3D ), indicating that cANGPTL4 exacerbated pulmonary bleeding and edema and could accelerate the infiltration of immune cells inside the lung tissue to aggravate tissue damage.",

Genes involved in the development of lung alveoli, respiratory tubes, and blood vessels were identified in the anti-cANGPTL4 mAbtreated infected mice, indicating earlier tissue regeneration.

The staining and microscopic imaging techniques were performed simultaneously under the same conditions, allowing the signal intensity to serve as a semiquantitative measure of the cANGPTL4 expression level. In the ten pneumonia samples that were symptomatic or microbe positive, we found brightly stained structures ( Figure 4B ; Table S2 ). These structures included the thickened layers around tubular structures as well as intensively stained structures in the damaged alveolar regions that appeared to be collapsed membrane-like structures ( Figure 4B ; Table S2 ). These structures were abundant in regions with dense infiltration or collapsed alveolar spaces. The nonpneumonia samples showed either very weak staining or staining restricted to a thin layer along the tubular structures, consistent with our observations in healthy mouse lung tissues (Figures 4B and 1F ; Table  S2 ).

Our interrogation of microarray data from influenza-infected mouse lungs also consistently detected elevated ANGPTL4 expression (Pommerenke et al., 2012) . These observations underscore the importance of ANGPTL4 in response to pneumonia. However, its role in infected lungs remained unclear. From our influenza mouse model, we observed that the ANGPTL4 mRNA expression profile mirrored the pattern of viral replication. Probing further, we showed that IL-6-activated STAT3 directly regulated the expression of ANGPTL4. This is consistent with microarray analysis showing that pulmonary alveolar type II epithelial cells deficient in STAT3 have lower ANGPTL4 mRNA levels compared to their wild-type counterparts (Xu et al., 2007) .",

Interestingly, we observed that the peak expression of cANGPTL4 protein at 13 dpi was likely attributed to the increase in activity of furin PCs that preceded and overlapped with cANGPTL4 protein expression. Recent work showed that two novel peptidomimetic furin inhibitors inhibit hemagglutinin cleavage and viral propagation of a highly pathogenic avian H7N1 influenza virus strain in vitro (Becker et al., 2012) . The in vivo effect of such furin inhibitors, which conceivably prevent the proteolytic cleavage of flANGPTL4 to release cANGPTL4, on lung tissue recovery remains to be explored.",

In vivo and ex vivo imaging of infected mice treated with neutralizing anti-cANGPTL4 mAb revealed diminished pulmonary tissue leakiness compared to isotype control IgG treatment. The direct consequence was reduced pulmonary edema and immune cell-infiltrated lung regions. The overall lung tissue integrity was improved and the alveolar space appeared to be well recovered for normal function as supported by microarray analysis. Administration of anti-cANGPTL4 mAb during the damage window, when cANGPTL4 protein levels were low, showed no observable difference compared to control. Thus, targeting cANGPTL4 to modulate tissue leakiness along with its collateral benefits is a promising approach toward the development of therapy for influenza treatment, specifically lung recovery. Our finding that host protein ANGPTL4 participates in pulmonary leakiness and lung injury responses during influenza pneumonia is an important step toward a better understanding of influenza pathogenesis and how it can be manipulated to reduce the burden of pneumonia.",

Wild-type mice and mice heterozygous for ANGPTL4 (C57/B6 background) were obtained from the Mutant Mouse Regional Resource Center (MMRRC), an NIH-funded strain repository, and were donated to the MMRRC by Genentech. ANGPTL4 KO mice were identified using RT-PCR quantification of ANGPTL4 expression compared to wild-type mice. Influenza H1N1virus A/PR/8/34 strain (PR8) was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. PR8 was propagated in embryonated eggs at 37 C for 72 hr, and the allantoic fluid was harvested as a viral stock. Virus titers were determined by the plaque assay via infection of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Mice were housed in BSL2 facilities and infected with a sublethal dose of PR8 (30 pfu in 75 ml of PBS [pH 7.4] per mouse) or with a lethal dose (1,000 pfu) by intratracheal inhalation under anesthesia. Mice were anesthetized using a ketamine/xylazine cocktail. When fully anesthetized, the mouse was held up and 30 pfu of PR8 virus in 75 ml of PBS was introduced into the back of its mouth to be breathed into the trachea, with its tongue held tightly to prevent swallowing of the liquid pipetted in. Lungs were harvested from anesthetized mice at indicated time points and stored at \u00c080 C until further use. Female 8-to 12-week-old BALB/c mice were infected with a sublethal dose of mouse-adapted influenza A/Aichi/2/68 H3N2 virus (1,500 pfu). Female 8-to 12-week-old ANGPTL4 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were infected also using 30 pfu of PR8 virus for comparison with ANGPTL4 +/+ mice. Lung tissues were harvested for further analysis at 11 and 18 dpi. All animal protocols were approved by the respective institutional animal care and use committees at National University of Singapore (050/11) and Nanyang Technological University (ARF SBS/NIE-A0200AZ).",
