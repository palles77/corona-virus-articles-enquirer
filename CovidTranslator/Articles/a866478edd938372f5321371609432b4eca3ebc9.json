Sensing of dsRNA by cellular immune sentry proteins, such as retinoic acid-inducible I (RIG-I) (11) and melanoma differentiation-associated 5 (MDA-5) (12), initiates signaling pathways that result in the translocation of IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, IRF-3 activates expression of IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2, which initiates the antiviral response in the infected cells and primes neighboring cells for a rapid response to viral invasion. The NP proteins of LASV, Junin, Machupo, and LCMV have all been implicated in suppression of the innate IFN response, resulting in the inhibition of nuclear translocation of IRF-3 (13) . This inhibition can result in unchecked viral replication, failure to initiate an adaptive immune response, and increased morbidity and mortality (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . Muta-genesis throughout LCMV NP, before the availability of a structure, identified key residues within the C-terminal half of NP critical for immunosuppressive function (20, 21) . However, the role of these residues, and the specific mechanism by which arenavirus NPs cause immunosuppression, remained unknown.",

NP\u0394340 consists of a mixed, five-stranded \u03b2-sheet with one antiparallel strand (\u03b22) and six \u03b1-helices connected by a series of loops, with one particularly long loop between \u03b15 and \u03b16 forming a basic \"arm\" off one side (Fig. 1A) . The \u03b1-helices surround the \u03b2-sheet and are grouped into three sets of one (\u03b12), two (\u03b15, \u03b16), and three (\u03b11, \u03b13, \u03b14) helices each. The zinc atom is coordinated by E399, C506, H509, and C529, which are located at the bases of \u03b22, the protruding basic arm, and \u03b16, respectively (Fig. 1B) . The first 20 residues of the construct are disordered and are contained within a likely flexible linker between the N-and C-terminal domains of NP.",

However, an HHpred search, which searches alignment databases rather than sequence databases (24) , and a DALI (25) search for 3D folds similar to that of LASV NP surprisingly return numerous hits, all of which are members of the DEDD superfamily of exonucleases. The DEDD superfamily contains strictly conserved Asp-Glu-Asp-Asp catalytic residues in the active site and can further be subdivided into DEDDh or DEDDy groups based on the presence of a histidine or tyrosine, respectively, in close apposition to the DEDD core (26) . Alignment of NP\u0394340 with members of this family demonstrates that the 3D arrangement of their secondary structure elements is strikingly similar, with an average rmsd between LASV NP and known exonucleases of \u223c3 \u00c5 ( Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, both mainchain and side-chain positions of D389, E391, D533, and H528 of LASV NP align with D 1 , E 2 , D 4 , and h in active sites of known DEDDh enzymes, such as IFN-stimulated gene 20 (ISG-20) (27) and the \u03b5 subunit of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III (DNA pol III\u03b5) (28) .

To determine whether NP\u0394340 indeed has this enzymatic activity, NP\u0394340 was tested in exonuclease assays. First, to gain insight into the presence, specificity, and directionality of the exonuclease activity, a range of nucleic acid substrates were incubated with NP\u0394340 and then analyzed by denaturing PAGE and autoradiography. NP\u0394340 readily hydrolyzes an 18-bp dsRNA oligonucleotide to less than 6 bases but has no effect on ssRNA, ssDNA, or dsDNA ( Fig. 3A and Fig. S2 ). Subsequent experiments further elucidate NP\u0394340 specificity for different dsRNA substrates. dsRNA with a 3-nt overhang on either the 5\u2032 or the 3\u2032 end is digested to approximately the same size as blunt-ended dsRNA. However, the 3\u2032 overhang somewhat reduces the efficiency of the reaction. dsRNA containing a 5\u2032 triphosphate is also digested regardless of whether the ends are blunt or contain a single 5\u2032 nucleotide overhang (34) . Lastly, in a time-course experiment, we found that a 5\u2032-labeled, blunt-ended 18-bp dsRNA substrate was hydrolyzed to increasingly smaller products that still carried the 5\u2032 label, leading us to conclude that NP\u0394340 operates in a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction (Fig. 3B ). In summary, NP\u0394340 specifically digests dsRNA in a 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction and can process blunt-ended, overhang, or 5\u2032 triphosphate-labeled dsRNA.",

By contrast, the N-terminal half of NP (NP 1-340 ) has no ribonucleolytic activity in the same assay, indicating that NP\u0394340 is sufficient for the exonuclease activity of the complete LASV NP (Fig. 3C ). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of NP\u0394340 was performed to test the catalytic and/or structural roles of conserved residues in and proximal to the active site, with each mutant incubated with blunt-ended 18-bp dsRNA (data are given in Fig. 3D , and residues are illustrated in Fig. 4 ). Mutations at any of the DEDDh active site residues abolish exonuclease activity. Furthermore, mutations of nearby residues and residues that coordinate the Zn atom also abolish exonuclease activity. An R393A mutation has no effect on exonuclease activity, suggesting that R393, although proximal to the active site, is not critical for enzymatic function. A four-site mutation targeting the stretch of basic residues in the \u03b15-\u03b16 arm (K 516 K 517 K 518 R 519 , termed \"QuadA\") shows partial activity. The structure of the E. coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment bound to dsDNA revealed the presence of a basic arm that makes contact with the primer strand of the duplex DNA (35) . Furthermore, structures of several other DEDDh exonucleases that process dsDNA or structured RNA substrates also reveal the presence of either a basic arm or a basic groove proximal to the active site (28, 31, 36) . Thus, is it is possible that the side chains located in the basic arm region of LASV NP may also interact with the phosphodiester backbone of nucleic acid strands as they enter the acidic cavity (Fig. S3) .",

The protein was active in the presence of Mg 2+ , Mn 2+ , Co 2+ , and Zn 2+ ions (Fig. S4 ). Similar to other DEDD exonucleases, LASV NP\u0394340 was inactive in the presence of EDTA and Ca 2+ and Cu 2+ ions (37, 38) . (49) shows that each exonuclease has an acidic active site and highlights the basic arm of LASV NP. Positive surface is colored blue; negative surface is colored red with limits \u00b1 10 kT/e. Exonuclease Activity of LASV NP\u0394340 Is Essential for Innate Immune Suppression. Previous studies have established that the NPs from many arenavirus species are able to suppress the innate immune system by preventing the translocation of IRF-3 into the nucleus (20, 39) . In addition, residues D382 and G385 of LCMV NP as well as the equivalent residues of LASV NP (D389 and G392) have been implicated in the suppression of the innate immune system (21) . To expand on these results and further assess role of individual amino acids and domains of LASV NP in counteracting the IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 response, a panel of single-residue mutations to the C-terminal region of full-length LASV NP, as well as the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of NP expressed individually (NP and NP\u0394340), were tested for their ability to suppress translocation of IRF-3 into the nucleus, as measured by the expression of firefly luciferase under the control of an IRF-3dependent promoter (Fig. 5) . The ability of each mutant to suppress IRF-3 translocation mirrors its respective exonuclease activity: wild-type full-length NP and R393A NP suppress IRF-3 translocation. By contrast, NP point mutants that abrogate exonuclease activity permit IRF-3 translocation, indicating that proper exonuclease function is critical to innate immune suppression in vitro. All mutants are expressed to similar levels as wild-type NP (Fig. S5) , indicating the failure to inhibit the IRF-3-dependent promoter was not caused by a defect in protein synthesis. Furthermore, the N-terminal portion of NP (NP 1-340 ) has no effect on IRF-3 translocation, whereas NP\u0394340 suppresses translocation to a similar level as that of wild-type NP, indicating NP\u0394340 is necessary and sufficient for immune suppression in vitro.",

In addition to structurally resembling an exonuclease, NP functions like an exonuclease, with high specificity for dsRNA-specific degradation in the 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 direction. This exonuclease activity is likely required for the immunosuppression caused by LASV NP, as residues previously identified as essential for arenaviral anti-IFN activity are now shown to lie within the exonuclease active site (21) . Arenavirus NPs are 60-85% similar in the immunosuppressive domain, and residues in the DEDDh active site are completely conserved in the virus family (Fig. S6) , suggesting that this activity may be a shared feature of arenavirus NPs.",

            "text": "Might the exonuclease activity play a role in replication? In LCMV NP, mutations that abolish replication (I373A, W380A, C518A, I524A, and L544A) are largely distinct from those that abolish IFN suppression (D382, G385, and C518) (21) . The only mutations that consistently abolish both functions are those that likely disrupt the tertiary structure of NP: C518A, which coordinates a Zn atom critical to the structure, and excisions of two or more adjacent residues contained within an \u03b1-helix or within the exonuclease active site (as indicated by the LASV NP structure). Residues in LCMV NP that showed defects in viral replication but not anti-IFN activity did not appear to map to regions in or proximal to the exonuclease active site of LASV NP. Thus, it is likely that the C-terminal domain of the arenavirus NP has separate but perhaps complementary functions, whereby the anti-IFN activity may be closely tied with the overall replicative capacity of the virus. Elimination of dsRNA generated during viral replication by the exonuclease NP would remove a key signature of viral infection and allow the virus to replicate unchecked. For example, Mart\u00ednez-Sobrido et al. (21) demonstrated that mutation of D382 in LCMV NP (equivalent to LASV NP D389) had only a slight effect on viral titers when LCMV was grown in IFNdeficient cell lines but a marked effect on titers when the virus was grown in IFN-competent cell lines. Hence, mutations that affect the anti-IFN capabilities of the NP may also, consequently, affect the ability of the virus to replicate efficiently and without interference by the immune system. Although the DEDDh motif is conserved among arenaviruses, there are a few differences elsewhere in NP between LASV and the other arenaviruses, and it is possible that the exact residues critical for exonuclease and immune suppression functions vary. For LASV NP, we find that E391 is important for blocking IRF-3, whereas R393 is not (Fig. 5) . By contrast, a previous report (21) indicates that the reverse is true for LCMV. For LCMV NP, E384 (E391 equivalent) is not important for suppression of the innate immune response, whereas R386 (R393 equivalent) is important (21) . Furthermore, Tacaribe virus (TACV), a nonpathogenic arenavirus, does not effectively suppress the innate immune system (13), although it is not immediately clear why because TACV shares the identical DEDDh and Zn-coordination residues. The deposited sequence for TACV NP (accession no. AAA47903) contains an Asp at position 392, which lies in the exonuclease active site, rather than a Gly as in other arenavirus nucleoproteins, suggesting that the G to D change might contribute to the decreased anti-IFN function of TACV. However, by sequencing multiple independent clones of TACV, Mart\u00ednez-Sobrido et al. (21) found that all sequenced TACV NP clones actually contained Gly-392 rather than Asp-392. Thus it is unlikely that the decreased anti-IFN function of TACV is related to this particular residue. It is possible that other variations within the TACV genome contribute to its altered immunosuppression phenotype, and it is not yet clear whether TACV NP possesses the same exonuclease activity as LASV does.",

The nsp14 protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus is a member of the DEDDh family and therefore also has 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 activity (40) . Nsp14 shows activity against both ssRNA and dsRNA and has been implicated in the control of RNA synthesis and genome fidelity (41) . However, no IFN suppressive activity is known for nsp14. Another DEDD exonuclease, TREX1, has recently been shown to digest HIV reverse transcripts found in the cytosol (42) . However, TREX1 is encoded by the host rather than the virus, and is specific for ssDNA rather than any form of RNA.

For reactions with dsDNA/dsRNA, an excess of unlabeled antisense DNA/RNA was added to labeled sense DNA/RNA and annealed at 65\u00b0C for 5 min. In vitro transcription was used to generate a 54-nt 5\u2032 triphosphatecapped RNA oligo. Excess, unlabeled, in vitro-transcribed sense RNA was annealed to labeled antisense oligomers corresponding to either nucleotides 1-20 or 2-21 to create 5\u2032 triphosphate-containing 20-bp dsRNA with either blunt ends or with a single 5\u2032 unpaired nucleotide, respectively. Reactions were performed in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 5 mM MgCl 2 . After incubation for 15 min, reactions were stopped with the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer and boiled. For time-course experiments, reactions were stopped at intervals between 0 and 30 min. The products were then analyzed in 18% polyacrylamide gels containing 8 M urea and buffered with 0.5\u00d7 Tris-borate-EDTA. Gels were exposed overnight to a phosphor screen (Amersham) and then imaged with a Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Western Blot Analysis. Proteins were separated by SDS/PAGE and then transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 10% milk, membranes were probed with anti-HA 16B12 (Covance) for 1 h. After",

After three washes with PBS/Tween, membranes were developed with SIG-MAFAST BCIP/NBT (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Note Added in Proof. While this manuscript was under consideration, Qi et al. published \"Cap binding and immune evasion revealed by Lassa nucleoprotein structure\" (50) . In experiments using various ssRNA oligonucleotides, which could potentially form duplexes or hairpins, and RNA and DNA molecular weight markers as substrates, Qi et al conclude that LASV NP has no specificity for any nucleic acid type, leaving open the question of how the exonuclease activity could suppress an antiviral immune response in partic-ular. Here we illustrate that the exonuclease activity of LASV NP is indeed specific for dsRNA, such as the products produced during viral infection.",
