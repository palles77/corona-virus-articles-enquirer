            "text": "Background: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a newly emerged coronavirus that is associated with a severe respiratory disease in humans in the Middle East. The epidemiological profiles of the MERS-CoV infections suggest zoonotic transmission from an animal reservoir to humans. Methods: This study was designed to investigate animal herds associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-infected patients in Saudi Arabia, during the last three years (2014)(2015)(2016). Nasal swabs and serum samples from 584 dromedary camels, 39 sheep, 51 goats, and 2 cattle were collected. Nasal samples from camels, sheep, goats, and cattle were examined by real-time reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) to detect MERS-CoV RNA, and the Anti-MERS ELISA assay was performed to detect camel humeral immune response (IgG) to MERS-CoV S1 antigen infection. The complete genome sequencing of ten MERS-CoV camel isolates and phylogenetic analysis was performed. Results: The data indicated that seventy-five dromedary camels were positive for MERS-CoV RNA; the virus was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle. MERS-CoV RNA from infected camels was not detected beyond 2 weeks after the first positive result was detected in nasal swabs obtained from infected camels. Anti-MERS ELISA assays showed that 70.9% of camels related to human cases had antibodies to MERS-CoV. The full genome sequences of the ten MERS-CoV camel isolates were identical to their corresponding patients and were grouped together within the larger MERS-CoV sequences cluster for human and camel isolates reported form the Arabian Peninsula. Conclusions: These findings indicate that camels are a significant reservoir for the maintenance of MERS-CoVs, and they are an important source of human infection with MERS.",

MERS is considered a life-threatening disease with an extensive health impact. The clinical manifestations vary from subclinical manifestations to rapid progressive acute pneumonia. MERS-CoV-infected patients often present fever, sore throat, myalgia, cough, and shortness of breath, and occasionally hemoptysis [1] [2] [3] . MERS-CoV was first identified in 2012 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia [4] . Since its identification, MERS has been responsible for 2040 cases and 712 deaths in 27 countries worldwide by July 21, 2017 [5] . The majority of cases and deaths occurred in Saudi Arabia, most of which were sporadic infections, sometimes leading to family or hospital clusters [6] .",

Initial investigations have indicated that MERS-CoV originated from bats; sequences related to MERS-CoV have been found in several bat species [6, 7] . Several other animal species in the Arabian Peninsula have been serologically assessed for MERS-CoV infection [8] . Viral and serological surveillance revealed a high rate of seropositivity to MERS-CoV in dromedary camels, including detection of antibodies to MERS-CoV in sera of camels in different countries (i.e., Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Egypt, Jordan, Nigeria, Tunisia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Canary islands, Pakistan, and Mali) [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Recovery of MERS-CoV genome sequences from camels with a high degree of homology to their counterparts in humans and isolation of MERS-like CoV from camels have been reported [9, 10, 14, 15, 19, 20, 21] . Together, these results suggest that the MERS-CoV detected in dromedary camels is the most likely source of the human infection [8, 9, 15, 20, 21] . The questions that need to be addressed are why the majority of human infections occur in Saudi Arabia, and whether interspecies transmission of the MERS-CoV to humans has only recently occurred or has only been recently recognized. The epidemiological factors related to these questions need to be investigated.",

The majority of cases have been reported in Saudi Arabia, and most of them were reported in hospitals and healthcare units (nosocomial infection). The incidence of primary cases draws attention to a possible animal source, indicating a potential zoonotic infection. Several studies have reported a high prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camels [9, 11, 14] . Interestingly, antibodies to MERS-CoV have been detected in camel sera collected more than 10 years ago from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) [11] . In addition, MERS-CoV has been reported in camels in many cross-sectional and longitudinal studies [10, 19, 20, 21] . However, other farm animals (cattle, sheep, Table 2 The prevalence of MERS-CoV antibodies in dromedary camel linked to human cases in different regions, sex and ages in Saudi Arabia. and goats) were negative for MERS-CoV antigen and antibodies [14, 15] . These results strongly suggest that the dromedary camels are the most likely source of the MERS-CoV infection; furthermore, these findings necessitate the investigation of MERS-CoV in animals related to MERS patients. This study showed that MERS-CoV RNA was detected in 12.6% of dromedary camels associated with MERS-patients, while the MERS-CoV genome was not detected in sheep, goats, and cattle; this is in accordance with previous studies [14, 15, 30] . The prevalence of MERS-CoV RNA in different regions of Saudi Arabia varied from 60% in Al-Madina to 0% in Shagraa, Northern Boundaries, Hail, Baha, Gizan, Zulfi, Majmaa, Tabuk, and Wadi El-Dwasir. Available data confirmed that dromedary camels were the primary reservoirs of MERS-CoV and direct contact with dromedaries in Saudi Arabia was found to be independently associated with MERS-CoV illness, while contact with goats, sheep, or cattle was not associated with human disease [31, 32] . The analysis of nasal swabs revealed that the maximum period for viral shedding from infected camels was 2 weeks after the initial detection; this is in accordance with previous studies [33] .",

Evidence suggests that camels were the source of MERS-CoV that infected patients who had had close contact with the camel's nasal secretions. The presence of identical sequences of MERS-CoV isolates recovered from patients and related camels indicates that direct cross-species transmission probably occurred, and dromedary camels were the source of MERS-CoV that infected the patients who had close contact with them.
