            "text": "Six porcine epidemic diarrhea viruses (PEDVs) were isolated from the fecal samples of piglets infected with PEDV in 2006 in China. The membrane (M) protein genes of six PEDV isolates were amplified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), then cloned, sequenced, and compared with each other as well as those ten PEDV reference strains. The M protein genes of six Chinese PEDV isolates consisted of 692 nucleotides containing a single open reading frame (ORF) of 681 nucleotides, which encoded a 226aa-long peptide. The conserved intergenic motif (ATAAAC), as previously recognized in Br1/87, was found in the 5 nucleotides upstream of the initiator ATG of M protein genes of six Chinese PEDV isolates. The hexamer motif was also found in CV777, JMe2, LZC, and QH. The M protein of six isolates had three main transmembrane domains (aa20-38, aa43-65, aa75-97). The M protein of one isolate, CH/IMT/ 06, had one potential glycosylation site, but those of the other five isolates had two. The glycosylation sequence Asn-Phe-Thr was highly conserved in the M proteins of six PEDV isolates. The six PEDV isolates showed nucleotide sequence homology between 98.8 and 100% and deduced amino acid sequence homology between 98.2 and 100% with each other. The nucleotide and amino acid identity of M protein genes between the six PEDV isolates and ten reference PEDV strains varied from 97.2 to 99.4% and 96.9 to 100%, respectively. On the basis of the phylogenetic relationship of M protein genes, six Chinese PEDV isolates composed of a separate cluster including one Chinese strain JS-2004-02, however, not including the Chinese strain LJB/03. These results demonstrated that there was a new genotype of PEDV prevailing in China.",

According to an accurate analysis on genome of prevalent PEDVs, we can prevent outbreaks of the PEDV-induced diarrhea more effectively and choose the correct PEDV vaccine strain. By the phylogenetic analysis of the partial spike glycoprotein genes, the Korean PEDV isolates were divided into three groups (G1, G2, G3), which had three subgroups (G1-1, G1-2, G1-3) [9] . Like S glycoprotein gene, M protein gene is also an important component in the phylogenetic analysis of the epidemiological situation of PEDV in the field. On the basis of sequence analysis of M protein gene, Korean PEDV isolates were shown to be different from foreign PEDV strains [10] . Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the diversity among the Chinese PEDV isolates and was to find out more prevalent PEDVs in China by the sequence analysis and the phylogenetic relationship of the M protein genes with Chinese PEDV isolates and reference PEDV strains.",

The M proteins of six isolates were highly hydrophobic, and had four hydrophobic domains alternating with short hydrophilic regions in the amino-terminal half of the protein. The locations of three main transmembrane regions were aa20-38, aa43-65 and aa75-97, respectively, but the location of the fourth hydrophobic domain was not shown (predicted by http://www.cbs.tdu.dk/CBS Prediction Servers/TMHMM Server v. 2.0). In the center of the M protein, directly adjacent to the third hydrophobic domain, was a stretch of eight amino acids (SWWSFNPE) (Fig. 2) , which was well conserved in the coronavirus M proteins [12] .",

Intriguingly, whereas the group 1 and group 3 coronaviruses-with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) as important representatives, respectively-all contain M proteins with only N-linked sugars, the M proteins of group 2 coronaviruses such as mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are O-glycosylated [13] , An exception is MHV-2, the M protein of which carries both O-and N-linked sugars [14] . The M protein plays a central role in coronavirus assembly. Together with the minor E protein it is responsible for the assembly of the coronavirus envelope [15] [16] [17] .

Although PEDV is known to have only one serotype at present, the genome of PEDV is widely to show genetic diversity, according to the analysis results using molecular biological methods [21] [22] [23] . The M protein genes of four Chinese strains (LJB/03, JS-2004-2, LZC, and QH) have been sequenced and reported. Although the phylogenetic analysis based on M protein gene of LJB/03 was reported [24] , it could not reflect the phylogenetic relationship among the PEDV field strains in China. Although the bi-combined attenuated vaccine against TGEV and PEDV infection is authorized to use in swine farms, PED still occurs in the immunized swine herds in China. So it is necessary to further investigate the prevalence status of PEDV based on the phylogenetic analysis of M protein genes of PEDV field strains in China.",

Our findings show that Chinese PEDV isolates are genetically diverse in their M protein genes, both among themselves and as compared with reference strains. The hexamer motif (ATAAAC), which locates at the 5 0 end of M protein gene, are conserved among the six isolates. They are identical to those found in the corresponding sites in strains CV777, Br1/87, JMe2, LZC, and QH. The M proteins of six isolates have four hydrophobic domains alternating with short hydrophilic regions in the amino-terminal half of the protein, and the forth hydrophobic domain may has functions as a cleavable signal peptide. In the center of M proteins of six isolates, directly adjacent to the third hydrophobic domain, are also the stretches of eight amino acids (SWWSFNPE) that are well conserved as mentioned by de Haan [12] . The coronavirus M protein is almost invariably glycosylated in its exposed amino-terminal domain. N-linked glycosylation is initiated in the endoplasmic reticulum by the cotranslational linkage of a large oligosaccharide structure to the polypeptide at asparagine residues within the consensus sequence NXS/T (where X is any amino acid). By prediction, five isolates have two N-linked glycosylation sites except CH/IMT/06 that has one N-link glycosylation site. The M proteins of group1 and 3 coronaviruses and SARS-CoV all contain with only N-linked sugars.

Although CH/SHH/06, CH/HNCH/06, CH/IMB/06 were isolated in different provinces, they had identical nucleotide sequences. It showed that the three isolates maybe originated from the same ancestor. CH/HLJH/06 was highly homologous to JS-2004-2, but they were isolated in different provinces at different time. Although CH/IMB/06 and CH/IMT/06 were isolated in the same province, the sequence homology between them was lower. These results indicated that the Chinese PEDV isolates had genetic diversity with respect to the M protein genes. By phylogenetic analysis, the six Chinese PEDV isolates with JS-2004-2 formed a separate group, which excluded European strains, Korean strains, Japanese strain and three Chinese strains (QH, LZC, LJB/03). The phylogenetic relationship indicated that Chinese PEDV isolates were different from foreign PEDV strains and a new genotype PEDV was prevailing in China. We expect to prevent outbreaks of the PEDV-induced diarrhea more effectively, according to choosing the more efficient PEDV vaccine strain by accurate analysis on genome of prevalent PEDVs in China. Moreover, genetic variation existence in M protein genes of Chinese PEDV isolates and more prevalent PEDVs discovery in China will form the basis for further functional exploration of PEDV.",
