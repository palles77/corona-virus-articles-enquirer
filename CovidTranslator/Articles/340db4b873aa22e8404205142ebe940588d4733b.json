            "text": "Introduction: Despite the global success of Hib vaccination in reducing disease and mortality, uncertainty about the disease burden and the potential impact of Hib vaccination in Southeast Asia has delayed the introduction of vaccination in some countries in the region. Hib vaccination was introduced throughout Vietnam in July 2010 without catch-up. In an observational, population based surveillance study we estimated the impact of routine Hib vaccination on all cause radiologically confirmed childhood pneumonia in Nha Trang, Vietnam. Materials and methods: In 2007 active hospital based surveillance was established in Khanh Hoa General Hospital, the only hospital in Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa province. Nasopharyngeal samples and chest radiographs are taken routinely from all children diagnosed with acute respiratory illness on admission. For admissions between 02/2007 and 03/2012 chest radiographs were interpreted for the presence of WHO primary endpoint pneumonia and nasopharyngeal swabs were analysed by PCR for the presence of Influenza A or B, RSV and rhinovirus. We employed Poisson regression to estimate the impact of Hib vaccination on radiologically confirmed pneumonia (RCP) while statistically accounting for potential differences in viral circulation in the post vaccination era which could have biased the estimate. Results: Of 3151 cases admitted during the study period, 166 had RCP and major viruses were detected in 1601. The adjusted annual incidence of RCP in children younger than 5 years declined by 39% (12-58%) after introduction of Hib vaccination. This decline was most pronounced in children less than 2 years old, adjusted IRR: 0.52 (0.33-0.81), and no significant impact was observed in the 2-4 years old who were not eligible for vaccination, adjusted IRR: 0.96 (0.52-1.72). Discussion: We present early evidence that the burden of Hib associated RCP in Nha Trang before vaccination was substantial and that shortly after introduction to the routine childhood immunisation scheme vaccination has substantially reduced that burden.",

Unlike bacteraemic infection, where isolation of a pathogen from blood provides well-established evidence of disease causality, the causal pathogen for non-bacteraemic pneumonia is typically unknown and no gold standard diagnostic techniques is available [20] [21] [22] . Widespread pre-hospitalisation use of antibiotics without prescription in Asian countries further limits proper aetiological identification. The lack of gold standard diagnostic techniques to identify the pathogen associated with an episode of non-bacteraemic pneumonia obscures assessment of the vaccine preventable burden of Hib pneumonia in common study designs [23] . Furthermore, vaccine-unrelated changes in the epidemiology of other pathogens contributing to total number of pneumonia cases can distort population impact estimates. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influeanzae are the leading causes of non-bacteraemic pneumonia supplemented by a sizeable contribution of respiratory viruses, including Rhinovirus, Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [24, 25] . While most of the serotypes causing pneumococcal disease show little variation over time in the absence of vaccination, serotypes 1 and 5 vary substantially in prevalence over time for yet unknown reasons [26] and are likely to cause a substantial amount of pneumonia despite low carriage rates [27] . Similarly the outbreak size of winter viruses can differ between seasons and can confound impact assessments [28] .",

On admission, after obtaining informed consent from the parents or guardians, clinical and epidemiological information was collected by the respective paediatrician. Nasopharyngeal swabs and blood samples were taken by trained research nurses. Chest X-rays were taken within 24 h of admissions. In 2013 all chest X-rays were read independently by two designated radiologists according to WHO standards [37] . An expert panel reviewed discordant readings and a sample of positive readings. KHGH is the only hospital in Nha Trang, Khanh Hoa province and the only one accessible for residents of the catchment area.

The adjusted RR for non-viral associated RCP (NVP) was similarly estimated through a segmented Poisson regression model. With the same naming conventions as before the model additionally attributes excess cases of RCP (deemed virus associated pneumonia -VP), which includes both viral pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia infections, to changes in the monthly number of ARI due to influenza A, RSV, hMPV, parainfluenza 3, rhinovirus, adenovirus and bocavirus (N t,1-7 ).

The lack of a measurable impact of Hib vaccination in children between 2 and 4 years of age and too old to be vaccinated may suggest that herd protection has not been established yet and in subsequent years could further benefit the unvaccinated [40] .",

(A) In the absence of a catch up campaign a large proportion of individuals younger than 2 years of age have not been eligible for vaccination in the 21 months after vaccine introduction that we consider here. Hence our early estimate the impact of routine Hib vaccination is may be an underestimate of the full impact of Hib vaccination, although most Hib pneumonia is likely to occur in the first year. With an increasing duration of follow up a transition period can be included in the regression model to account for the initial period of low vaccination eligibility in the considered age groups and provide an estimate of the full impact of Hib vaccination. (B) We assume that a reduction of virus circulation among children presenting with acute respiratory symptoms is not associated with Hib vaccination. However, the observed decline could partly be due to a reduction in co-infections of viruses and Hib. In this case the crude estimate would be a more accurate estimate of the actual impact of Hib vaccination on RCP. (C) The decrease in severity of symptoms of children diagnosed with RCP at Khanh Hoa General Hospital in the post vaccination period could suggest an increase in health care seeking of children with milder symptoms. This could have led to an increase in the number of acute respiratory cases and RCPs reported over time, and in particular to an overrepresentation of ARI in the post vaccination era. On the other hand, it could reflect the rapid disappearance of severe childhood pneumonia associated with improved care seeking and overall socioeconomic development. When tested in a linear regression model we found no evidence for a significant decrease in RCP incidence during the pre vaccination era. (D) We do not account for possible changes in pneumococcal pneumonia, in particular due to volatile serotypes 1 and 5. In a subset of the pre vaccination period no serotype 1 or 5 carriage in children presenting with ARI was detected suggesting a low contribution of those types to pneumonia during this period [35] so any bias would likely underestimate the impact of Hib vaccination. There is no evidence available that allowed assessment of the circulation of pneumococcal serotypes and hence potential biases during the study period. However, a previous study did not find evidence of serotype 1 and 5 causing invasive pneumococcal diseases in Vietnam during the decade ending in 2002 [42] so their impact may be generally low in this setting and hence unlikely to greatly impact on our estimates. However in settings where those serotypes are more dominant, e.g. in Africa, this adjustment can be essential.",

Also the likelihood for the development of RCP on admission has potentially been reduced in the post vaccination era as the time from illness onset to hospitalisation decreased. Both, changes in antibiotic usage and timeliness of health care seeking could have led to an overestimation of the impact of Hib vaccination in our analysis. However, antibiotic usage and timeliness of health care seeking was similar between RCP cases and ARI cases without RCP suggesting that those factors had only modest impact on the development of RCP for a case admitted with acute respiratory symptoms in the study population. Furthermore, after the introduction of Hib vaccination we find little or no change in RCP incidence in 2-4 year old children, who were not eligible for vaccination in the study period tentatively suggesting that the observed impact among less than 2 year old children is vaccine specific and that potential changes in treatment and healthcare seeking behaviour in the population had little impact on RCP incidence.",

Nevertheless, influenza, RSV and rhinovirus are generally found to increase the risk of pneumonia [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . However, we could not find seasonally increased circulation of influenza A or B to be associated with a concurrent increase in radiologically confirmed pneumonia (Fig. 2C) . Furthermore the limited number of cases only allowed for monthly resolution of the data. Hence, possible lags between viral infection and associated secondary bacterial pneumonia were not accounted for. Moreover Influenza A subtypes were not differentiated in the analysis. If these subtypes were associated with significantly different risk for pneumonia this could have masked the true contribution of the subtypes on VP. Also the adequacy of chest radiographs as gold standard for pneumonia diagnosis may be questioned [48] , however, we use of multiple independent readers to minimise non-specificity.",

The corresponding incidence risk ratio was estimated at 0.43 (0.22-0.85).
