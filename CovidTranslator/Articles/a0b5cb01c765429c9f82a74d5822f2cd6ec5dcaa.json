            "text": "Licorice is the dried root of Glycyrrhiza glabra, Glycyrrhiza inflata or Glycyrrhiza uralensis, a member of legumes endogenous to Asia and southern Europe; widely used as flavoring and sweetening agent and also proposed for various clinical applications. Pharmacological effects of licorice include inhibition of gastric acid secretion, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, and anti-atherogenic have been well verified [1, 2] . An anti-carcinogenic effect of licorice has also recently been demonstrated [3] [4] [5] . These biological effects are attributed to a myriad of biologically active constituents: terpenoids, alkaloids, polysaccharides, polyamines, saponins, and flavonoids [6] [7] [8] . The most important constituent of licorice is glycyrrhizin (G, 3-O-(2-O-b-D-glucopyranuronosyl-a-D-glucopyranuronosyl)-3b-hydroxy-11-oxo-18,20-olean-12-en-29-oic acid) present in quantities of 3.6-13.1% in dried roots [9] . G consists of a disaccharide of two glucuronic acid molecules bound to the pentacyclic triterpene glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), which exists in two isomers (C-18 epimers): the trans (a GA) and the cis form (b GA) (Fig. 1) . G exhibits potent hydrocortisone-like anti-inflammatory, antiulcer, antiviral, and antihepatotoxic activities [10, 11] whereas GA is a potent antibiotic against ulcer causing Helicobacter pylori [12] .",

Nevertheless, for HPLC, it is rather difficult to resolve the 18a and 18b stereoisomers satisfactorily due to the very similar properties of these epimers. Only a few papers report procedures to distinguish a-GA and b-GA, using chiral separation, HPTLC and gel electrophoresis [13, 14] , which all require elaborate chromatography for a separation of the isomers. Interest in both G biological activity and improving QC analysis of licorice samples, drives the development of faster, stable and accurate methods for reliable G isomer assignment in licorice extracts.",

With an increasing interest in utilizing NMR for metabolic fingerprinting and phytomedicines QC analysis, it is now possible to record NMR spectra from crude plant extracts providing the valuable metabolite signature of a complex plant extract [16] . Unlike MS-based analyses, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy provides a large amount of information regarding molecular structure, and novel software innovations have facilitated the unequivocal identification of compounds within composite samples. However, NMR has a lower sensitivity compared to MS. Additionally, introducing another set of chemical shifts from the proton dimension as in ROESY spectra would also complicate the spectral processing using multivariate data analysis.",

            "text": "We have recently reported on the use of 1 H NMR for the metabolic fingerprinting of G. glabra, G. uralensis and G. inflata extracts, targeting its secondary metabolites [17] . G (Fig. 1 ) was identified in these extracts from its well resolved singlet signals at d 0.82 (Me-28), 0.85 (Me-24), 1.08 (Me-23), 1.13 (Me-25& 26), 1.16 (Me-29) and 1.41 (Me-27), (Fig. 2C) . In the sugar region, signals at d 4.49 d (7.3 Hz) and 4.67 d (7.7 Hz) were assigned to anomeric protons of glucuronic acid moieties at H-1 0 and H-1 00 position in glycyrrhizin, respectively [17] . For detailed description on extracts chemical composition and glycyrrhizin concentration, see Farag et al. [17] . NMR signals were assigned using a combination of 2D NMR experiments ( 1 H, 1 H COSY, HSQC, and HMBC). Nevertheless, utilizing 1 D NMR and these 2D-experiments, G isomer conformational assignment could not be successfully confirmed in most licorice extracts, due to crowded 1 H NMR spectra with matrix signals which do not allow detection of signals of 18aor 18b-G. 2D ( 1 H-1 H) ROESY, a method based on proton-proton dipolar relaxation through space, was considered suitable to distinguish between 18-a and b isomers. ROESY spectra for a-and b-glycyrrhetic acid standard show distinctive crosspeaks between H-18 and its neighboring protons indicative for each isomer configuration. While the a-isomer exhibits 1,3-diaxial interaction between H-18 (d 2.37) and CH 3 -27 (d 1.39) as well as CH 3 -29 (d 1.24), the b-isomer shows interaction between H-18 (d 2.18) and equatorial CH 3 -28 appearing at d 0.82 ( Fig. 2A  and B ). ROESY spectra acquired from all licorice samples revealed that the presence of G in its b-form coincides with standard GA b-isomer crosspeak patterns (Fig. 2C) . The variance was assessed by analyzing samples from three biological replicas for each specimen. Analytical reproducibility was further assessed by measuring triplicate NMR measurements over 2 days for the biological sample GG1 and showing almost superimposed crosspeak results (data not shown). These results confirm previous reports highlighting that the b-isomer is the natural form of glycyrrhizin in G. glabra and extends to allied species studied in this paper such as G. inflata and G. uralensis.",

            "text": "To address the issue of potential variation of the anti-inflammatory activity different species and accessions, we measured the ability of methanol extracts from 11 samples to inhibit cyclooxygenase-1 (COX1), an enzyme involved in inflammation processes (Fig. 3 ). G. glabra shows inhibitory effect on COX and LOX products [19] . In this study, extracts prepared from G. glabra and G. uralensis, were among the most effective ones, whereas extracts from G. echinata were the least effective ones tested at doses of 100, 150, and 200 lg/ml. Previous investigations concluded that G is an anti-inflammatory compound in licorice, acting by inhibiting the release of inflammatory mediators [20] . Nevertheless, both b-G and b-GA were found inactive on COX1 in our assay setup up at a dose of 500 lg/ml. In contrast to these results, liquiritin, a major flavonoid in Glycyrrhiza sp. [17] was active in the COX1 assay with an IC 50 value of 96 \u00b1 8 lg/ml. In addition to triterpene saponins, numerous pharmacologically active polyphenols in quantities of 1-5% have been isolated from Glycyrrhiza sp. and might be accountable for its potent anti-inflammatory effect [21] . These findings suggest that with regard to COX1 inhibition enzyme assay, phenylpropanoids constitute an indispensible part of licorice anti-inflammatory efficacy, arguing for a possible (synergistic or at least additive) effect of several secondary metabolites in targeting different enzymes involved in inflammation. A positive relationship appears to exist between the total polyphenols (TP) content and the anti-inflammatory activity for most species, with a potential correlation to phenolic antioxidant activity. Accessions demonstrating the most potent anti-inflammatory effect were enriched in TP, i.e. G. glabra and G. uralensis showed the best effect. A similar trend to the opposite side was observed for species with low TP, i.e. G. echinata (Fig. 3) . Thus, total COX1-inhibitor activity of crude methanol extracts appeared to be dominantly correlated to the (TP) content, which differs across species. It should be noted that no significant difference in TP or anti-inflammatory effect was observed for samples belonging to the same species but coming from different geographical origin. These data support the observation that licorice is an effective COX 1 inhibitor, and provide more insight into the nature of the compounds mediating for such an effect.",

            "text": "Increasing evidence in the literature point toward the marked cytotoxic effect found for licorice flavonoids including isoliquiritigenin [22] . Our objective was also to investigate cytotoxicity potential of licorice extracts with different flavonoid composition as revealed from our chemical analysis [17] . All samples were tested for growth inhibition of (mutated androgen dependent) prostate (PC3) and (androgen independent) colon (HT-29) cancer cell lines at doses of 5, 10 and 20 lg/ ml. All extracts show only weak inhibition in this assay setup, except for G. inflata with an IC 50 value of 13 and 17 lg/ml for HT29 and PC3, respectively. The high content of moderately cytotoxic compounds such as polyphenols and chalcones in G. inflata [17] probably is responsible for the growth inhibition effect. Relevant amounts of licochalcone A, the major isoprenylated retrochalcone in G. inflata, are absent in the other species samples as revealed by 1 H NMR analysis [17] . Thus pure licochalcone A was tested separately and exhibited significant activity at lower IC 50 values (PC3, 9.6 lg/ml; HT29, 8.0 lg/ ml) suggesting that it likely is the main mediator of cytotoxicity in G. inflata extract. Indeed, several laboratories evidenced the marked cytotoxic effect for licochalcone A against various cancer cell lines including lung, colon, prostate and skin cancer cell lines [23] . Several other retrochalcones such as licochalcone C and D were present in G. inflata extract and may act additively or even synergistically with licochalcone A.
