They all showed comparable results in reduction of unspecific E gene signals. Using SuperScript III, the unspecific signals in the E gene screening assay were significantly reduced to 5% (13/257) in tested patient samples and negative extraction and non-template controls ( In the following, we decided to switch to the SuperScript III system as recommended by Corman et al. [5] , also because of its decreased thermoprofile run-time (Table) . Moreover, we additionally included a newly launched commercial test kit in our study: RealStar SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR kit 1.0 (Altona, Hamburg, Germany), which did not show unspecific E gene signals. A summary of the assay features of the three PCR setups tested and compared in detail is shown in the Table. For evaluation of assay performance regarding efficiency, linearity and unspecific signals, we used the SuperScript protocol in a direct comparison of 73 samples with the RealStar SARS-CoV-2 assay. The E gene assays showed 97% (71/73) identical results in both assays (60 negative and 11 positive results as well as two divergent results, both with a positive Real Star SARS-CoV-2 assay and a negative SuperScript protocol assay). The specific SARS-CoV-2 assays gave in 67 (92%) identical results (60 negative and seven positive) and six divergent results. Overall, the RealStar SARS-CoV-2 kit seemed to be more sensitive.",

Each mastermix has its own proprietary composition, which may explain the differences in the performance of a certain PCR assay. Using commercial kits with optimised target regions and primer sequences (in the E gene and SARS-CoV-2-specific S gene) ruled out the unspecific signals completely. Hence, reasons for the observed unspecific signals may be dimerisation of primers and probes and/or unspecific primer binding and polymerase activity in the targeted region of the E gene, probably also depending on thermal profile and cycler-specific differences, or most likely a combination of these factors.",

All reagents were aliquoted and aliquots used once only. Contaminations from synthetic E gene present in primer batches upon delivery can be ruled out as well, although only one batch of E gene primers and probes was used with the QuantiTect and Superscript III setup, as only a certain proportion of samples showed the unspecific signals. Furthermore, the unspecific signals were significantly reduced in the Superscript III setup, which showed that its sensitivity was comparable to the QuantiTect setup. In addition, the initially used E gene primers and probe were separately used as templates with the RealStar kit and no amplification was observed, whereas the corresponding artificial E gene template delivered a clear S-shaped curve with this kit.",
