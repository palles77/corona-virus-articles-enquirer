            "text": "The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) exemplifies the critical need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays to prompt public health actions. Currently, several quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays are being used by clinical, research, and public health laboratories for rapid detection of the virus. However, it is currently unclear if results from different tests are comparable. Our goal was to evaluate the primer-probe sets used in four common diagnostic assays available on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. To facilitate this effort, we generated RNA transcripts to create standards and distributed them to other laboratories for internal validation. We then used these RNA transcript standards, full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and RNA-spiked mock samples to determine analytical efficiency and sensitivity of nine primer-probe sets. We show that all primer-probe sets can be used to detect SARS-CoV-2, but there are clear differences in the ability to differentiate between true negatives and positives with low amounts of virus. Adding to this, many primer-probe sets, including the \"N2\" and \"N3\" sets issued by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have background amplification with SARS-CoV-2-negative nasopharyngeal swabs, which may lead to inconclusive results. Our findings characterize the limitations of commonly used primer-probe sets and can assist other laboratories in selecting appropriate assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2.",

Early detection prompts public health actions to prevent and control the spread of pathogens. This has been exemplified by the novel coronavirus, known as SARS-CoV-2, which was first identified as the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and rapidly spread around the world 1-3 . The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was critical for the development of diagnostics 2 , which led to several molecular assays being developed to detect COVID-19 cases [4] [5] [6] [7] . The World Health Organization (WHO) currently lists seven molecular assays (i.e. qRT-PCR) to diagnose COVID-19 8 ; however, it is not clear to many laboratories or public health agencies which assay they should adopt.",

To this end, we first generated RNA transcripts from a SARS-CoV-2 isolate from an early COVID-19 case from the state of Washington (United States) 9 . Using RNA transcripts, isolated virus RNA, and mock clinical samples, our analyses show that all of the primer-probe sets used in the qRT-PCR assays can detect SARS-COV-2, but we find important differences between the analytical sensitivities to detect low amounts of virus and the detection of false positives. Thus, we provide evidence that all of the assays are appropriate for virus detection as long as the limitations of each are recognized.",

As the full length SARS-CoV-2 RNA is considered as a biological safety level 2 hazard in the US, we generated small RNA transcripts (704-1363 nt) from the non-structural protein 10 (nsp10), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 14 (nsp14), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes spanning each of the primer and probe sets in the China CDC 7 , US CDC 6 , Charit\u00e9 5 , and HKU 4 assays ( Fig. 1A ; Table 1; Supplemental Tables 1-2 ) 10 . By measuring PCR amplification using 10-fold serial dilutions of our RNA transcript standards, we found the efficiencies of each of the nine primer-probe sets to be above 90% ( Fig. 1B ) , which match the criteria for an efficient qRT-PCR assay 11 . Our RNA transcripts can thus be used for assay validation, positive controls, and standards to quantify viral loads: critical steps for a diagnostic assay. Our protocol to generate the RNA transcripts is openly available 10 , and any clinical or research diagnostic lab can directly request them for free through our lab website ( www.grubaughlab.com ). (A) We reverse-transcribed RNA transcript standards for the non-structural protein 10 (nsp10), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), non-structural protein 14 (nsp14), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) genes to be used for validation of nine primer-probe sets used in SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assays.

Our goal in this study was to directly compare the designed primer-probe sets, not the assays per se , as that would involve many different variables. To do so we used the same (i) thermocycler conditions (40 cycles of 10 seconds at 95\u00b0C and 20 seconds at 55\u00b0C); (ii) primer-probe concentrations (500 nM of forward and reverse primer, and 250 nM of probe); and (iii) PCR reagents (New England Biolabs Luna Universal One-step RT-qPCR kit) in all reactions. From our measured PCR amplification efficiencies and analytical sensitivities of detection, most primer-probes sets were comparable, except for the RdRp-SARSr (Charit\u00e9) set, which had low sensitivity ( Fig. 2 ).",

We found that the two most sensitive primer-probe sets are E-Sarbeco (Charit\u00e9) and HKU-ORF1, which each detected 6/8 (75%) of the nasopharyngeal swabs spiked with 10 virus genome equivalents/\u03bcL ( Fig. 3 ).

Thus, our results show that there are differences in each of the primer-probe sets to differentiate between true negatives and true positives at virus concentrations at or below 10 virus genome equivalents/\u03bcL. Fig. 3 : All nine primer-probe sets have a similar lower detection limit of 10 2 SARS-CoV-2 genome equivalents/\u03bcL.

We performed 6-8 technical replicates with mock samples without spiking RNA and mock samples spiked with 10 0 -10 2 genome equivalent/\u03bcL of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.

We deviated from the recommended concentrations in the original assays to make a fair comparison across primer-probe sets, using 500 nM of each primer and 250 nM of probe 2. To investigate the effect of primer-probe concentration on the ability to detect SARS-CoV-2, we made a direct comparison between (i) our standardized primer (500 nM) and probe (250 nM) concentrations, (ii) the recommended concentrations of 600 nM of forward primer, 800 nM of reverse primer, and 100 nM of probe 1 and 2 (confirmatory assay), and (iii) the recommended concentrations of 600 nM of forward primer, 800 nM of reverse primer, and 200 nM of probe 2 (discriminatory assay) per reaction 5 .

This degenerate nucleotide appears to have been added to help the primer anneal to SARS-CoV and bat-SARS-related CoV genomes 5 , seemingly to the detriment of consistent SARS-CoV-2 detection. Earlier in the outbreak, before hundreds of SARS-CoV-2 genomes became available, non-SARS-CoV-2 data were used to infer genetic diversity that could be anticipated during the outbreak.

While these substitutions define a large clade that includes~13% of the available SARS-CoV-2 genomes and has been detected in numerous countries 13 , their position on the 5' location of the primer may not be detrimental to sequence annealing and amplification. The other high frequency variant that we detected was T\u2192C substitution at the 8 th position of the binding region of the 2019-nCoV_N3 forward primer, a substitution found in 39 genomes (position 28,688). While this primer could be problematic for detecting viruses with this variant, the 2019-nCoV_N3 set has already been removed from the US CDC assay. We found another seven variants in only five or fewer genomes (<0.5%, Fig. 5B ), and their minor frequency at present does not pose a major concern for viral detection. This scenario may change if those variants increase in frequency: most of them lie in the second half of the primer binding region, and may decrease primer sensitivity 14 .

This should be carefully evaluated to determine CT value cut-offs to differentiate between positives and negatives. The US CDC assay, for example, uses a cut-off value of CT 40, but we generated CT values in the range of 37-40 when the 2019-nCoV_N2 set was tested on RNA from nasopharyngeal swabs void of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Considering that both the US CDC 2019-nCoV_N1 and N2 sets need to be >40 CTs to be considered as negative, background amplification in one of the sets would result in inconclusive results.",

In contrast, the RdRp-SARSr (Charit\u00e9) primer-probe set had the lowest sensitivity, likely stemming from a mismatch in the reverse primer. Importantly, sensitivity as reported in our study may not be applicable to other PCR kits or thermocyclers; analytical sensitivities and positive-negative cut-off values should be locally validated when establishing these assays.",

Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from full-length SARS-CoV-2 RNA (WA1_USA strain from UTMB; GenBank: MN985325). Using PCR, we amplified the nsp10, RdRp, nsp14, E, and N genes with specifically designed primers ( Supplemental Table 1 ). We purified PCR products using the Mag-Bind TotalPure NGS kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) and quantified products using the Qubit High Sensitivity DNA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). We determined fragment sizes using the DNA 1000 kit on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). After quantification, we transcribed 100-200 ng of each purified PCR product into RNA using the Megascript T7 kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). We quantified RNA transcripts using the Qubit High sensitivity RNA kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) and checked quality using the Bioanalyzer RNA pico 6000 kit. For each of the RNA transcript standards ( Supplemental Table 2 ), we calculated the number of genome copies per \u00b5L using Avogadro's number. We generated a genomic annotation plot with all newly generated RNA transcript standards and the nine tested primer-probe sets based on the NC_045512 reference genome using the DNA Features Viewer Python package ( Fig.  1A ) 15 . We generated standard curves for each combination of primer-probe set with its corresponding RNA transcript standard ( Fig. 1B ) , using standardized qRT-PCR conditions as described below.",
