The next day, cells were transfected with 10 ng of pFLAG-CMV4 plasmid encoding RIG-I, MDA5, or an empty vector control (Ahmad et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2014) , together with 100 ng of IFN\u03b2 promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and 10 ng of CMV promoter-driven Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid (Lipofectamine2000, Life Technologies). The medium was changed 4 hours post-transfection with DMEM containing 1% FBS and the indicated concentration of NTZ. All experiments involving NTZ were performed in this manner in order to reduce the impact of serum proteins on NTZ's function in tissue culture, as NTZ is highly protein-bound (Stockis et al., 1996) FBS. As described above, the next day the medium was changed with DMEM containing 1% FBS and the indicated concentration of NTZ for 4 hrs, followed by stimulation with 10 ng/mL recombinant human IFN-\u03b2 (PeproTech),. Cells were harvested ~20 hr poststimulation and qPCR was performed as described above. CT values were normalized to Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Relative quantification was calculated by the comparative CT method and is shown as fold change of expression",
