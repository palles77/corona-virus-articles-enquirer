Coxsackievirus B3 (CoxB3) was the first virus detected in this condition in humans, 1 and adenoviruses of serotypes 2 and 5 were later described as common agents of myocarditis in children. 2 Systematic screening of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy has recently revealed that a rather broad spectrum of viruses may also chronically persist in human myocardium. 3 It is therefore assumed that acute cardiac viral infections may cause not only acute illness, but also chronic heart disease if not definitely eliminated from the heart. 4 The disease may progress to terminal heart failure and then require heart transplantation as a last therapeutic option.",

            "text": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a process of posttranscriptional gene silencing mediated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The introduction of double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNA) or vectors expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA) has already been successfully used to inhibit the replication of multiple viruses in vitro and in vivo including respiratory viruses, 5 hepatitis B 6, 7 and C viruses, 8 foot-and-mouth disease virus, 9 human herpesvirus-6, 10 cytomegalovirus, 11 SARS coronarvirus, 12 HIV-1 13 and CoxB3. 14, 15 However, the efficiency of RNAi depends on exact homology of the siRNA to the target sequence. A single mismatch can be sufficient to abrogate silencing by RNAi. 16 Many RNA viruses encode polymerase enzymes that lack proofreading abilities and, as a result, have high mutation rates. Thus, there is a high probability that viruses will rapidly develop resistance to a particular siRNA during virus replication by incorporation of nucleotide mutations within the target sequence of the siRNA. Thus, it has been shown that hepatitis C virus becomes resistant against a particular siRNA after several cycles of replication by the incorporation of point mutations within the siRNA target sequence. 17 Similar data have been reported for HIV-1 18 and poliovirus infections. 19 Therefore, therapeutic targeting of nonvariable virus-binding receptors on susceptible cells or other host cell molecules directly or indirectly involved in virus infections is an interesting alternative to targeting of the virus itself. 15, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] One approach of this type showed that downregulation of the CD4-independent attachment receptor (DC-SIGN) significantly inhibited HIV infection of dendritic cells (DC) and prevented the transfer of infectious HIV-1 particles from DC to T cells. 22 Adenoviruses of types 2 and 5 and CoxB3 use the coxsackievirus-adenovirus-receptor (CAR) to infect their target cells, either for virus attachment (adenoviruses) or virus internalization (CoxB3). 26 Therefore, CAR represents an attractive target for the inhibition of cardiac CoxB3 and adenovirus infections. It has been shown recently that suppression of CAR by RNAi results in inhibition of CoxB3 infections. 15, 27 These studies were carried out with cells of non-cardiac origin, and chemically synthesized siRNAs were used to inhibit CAR expression. However, the therapeutic use of synthetic siRNAs is significantly limited by their rapid degradation in target cells resulting in only transient gene silencing. 28 Moreover, most cells of cardiac origin are very difficult to transfect with chemically synthesized siRNAs even in vitro. These problems are significantly aggravated in vivo. Despite intense efforts during recent years, systemic and target organ-specific delivery of siRNAs remains a major hurdle for in vivo applications of RNAi.",

At an MOI from 60 to 100, GFP expression was seen in 76-80% of the cells, whereas no cytotoxic effects were observed. Further dose escalation resulted in an only slight further increase of transduction rate (Figure 3a) , and at an MOI of 500 or higher, cytotoxic effects became evident (increase of apoptotic cells, reduction of cell growth). HL-1 cells express mCAR1 but no mCAR2 on their cell surface (not shown). Therefore, the silencing capacity of the new AdshCAR4 m (Figure 1 ), which expresses the aboveevaluated most efficient shCAR4 m , was investigated with respect to mCAR1 expression in HL-1 cells only. To assess the amount of AdV-generated shCAR4 m , HL-1 cells were transduced with AdshCAR4 m at an MOI from 5 to 1000. The expression of shCAR4 m was analyzed 24, 48 and 72 h later. A time-and dose-dependent transcription of shCAR4 m was detected ( Figure 3b ). As a consequence of shRNA expression, strong downregulation of mCAR1-mRNA was observed 48 and 72 h after transduction. Near maximal reduction of 85-90% was observed at an MOI of 100. Higher doses did not result in Figure 3c ). These results indicate that an MOI of 100 was optimal for HL-1 transduction, as this dose allowed strong downregulation of mCAR1-mRNA in HL-1 cells, although cytotoxicity of the viral vector was still very low. We next investigated mCAR1 protein expression after transduction of HL-1 cells with AdshCAR4 m at an MOI of 100. To disrupt pre-existing membrane-associated mCAR1, HL-1 cells were trypsinized 24 h after Ad-shCAR4 m transduction and then re-seeded. This procedure led to ablation of mCAR1 protein at the cell surface 2 days after transduction (Figure 4a and b). In contrast, control cells rapidly re-expressed mCAR1 (Figure 4b ). Two days after AdshCAR4 m treatment, a few cells still displayed some membrane-associated mCAR1 immunoreactivity (Figure 4b ), probably reflecting residual mCAR1 domains still anchored in the cell membrane after trypsinization. At days 3 and 4 after AdshCAR4 m transduction, mCAR1 immunoreactivity disappeared from HL-1 cells, whereas it remained permanently detectable in the control cells ( Figure 4b ). Interestingly, CAR was expressed only at cell-to-cell contact sites in HL-1 cells, suggesting that the observed stability of CAR in intact monolayers is determined by homophilic or heterophilic CAR interaction at cell-to-cell contact sites. Together, the results indicate that AdshCAR4 m treatment efficiently inhibits the de novo synthesis of mCAR1.",

For this purpose, we first investigated the CoxB3 protective efficacy of AdshCAR4 m as a function of dose, at an MOI of AdshCAR4 m ranging from 10 to 100, using the same trypsin-involving experimental procedure as described above. HL-1 cells were infected with CoxB3 48 h after transduction with AdshCAR4 m and the amount of newly generated progeny virus was determined 6 days later. Virus plaque assays clearly demonstrated that CoxB3 replicates in HL-1 cells, but at a rather low frequency because no cytopathogenic effect was visible during the 6-day investigation period. As expected, the strongest reduction of CoxB3 progeny virus production by 97% was observed at the highest AdshCAR4 m dose Cells were then trypsinized, re-seeded and investigated using the polyclonal rabbit anti-CAR antibody H-300 directed against the extracellular domain of CAR. mCAR1 protein became undetectable as early as 2 days after transduction with AdshCAR4 m , whereas in the controls mCAR1 protein was abundantly expressed. (b) Detection of mCAR1 knockdown by indirect immunofluorescence. HL-1 cells were treated as in (a). mCAR1 expression was detected by indirect immunofluorescence using the polyclonal rabbit antibody RP-291 56 directed against the CAR variant with intracellular SIV tail (mCAR variant 1, accession no. NM_001025192). mCAR1 was abundantly expressed over the whole investigation period (4 days after transduction) in HL-1 cells transduced with control vector (left-hand panels). In contrast, mCAR1 was visible at low levels 2 days after transduction but became undetectable at later time points (right-hand panels). Cell nuclei are stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and overlaid images are shown. Notably, mCAR1 was localized only at cell-cell contact sites (white arrows), whereas cell membrane regions not in contact with other cells displayed no mCAR1 protein (yellow arrows). mCAR2 expression was not detectable in HL-1 cells by using polyclonal rabbit antibody RP-194 56 directed against the CAR variant with intracellular TVV tail (mCAR variant 2, accession no. NM_009988) (not shown). We later noted that CAR protein was downregulated by AdshCAR4 with similar kinetics if the trypsinization and re-seeding step was omitted. Figures 5b and 6 show that also the virus-related functionality of CAR in HL-1 cells was abandoned irrespective of trypsinization. (Figure 5a ). To investigate whether disruption of pre-existing CAR affects CoxB3 infections, we either treated HL-1 cells with the trypsin-involving experimental procedure described above, or omitted the trypsinization step after AdshCAR4 m transduction. The titers of CoxB3 progeny virus generated 5 and 6 days after CoxB3 infection were reduced strongly by about 97% in AdshCAR4 m -transduced cells, irrespective of whether membrane-associated CAR was disrupted by trypsinization or not (Figure 5b) . These experiments indicate that AdshCAR4 m inhibits CoxB3 replication in HL-1 cells with high efficacy. Moreover, proteolysis of membrane-associated CAR apparently does not affect CoxB3 infection.",

As a consequence of this delayed CAR downregulation, challenge of AdshCAR2 m -treated PNCMs with CoxB3 (MOI of 1) resulted in delayed inhibition of CoxB3 replication. In fact, significant reduction of CoxB3 replication was seen only if PNCMs were infected with CoxB3 on days 6 and 8 but not on day 3 after AdshCAR2 m treatment. The degree of CoxB3 inhibition was strongly dependent on the AdshCAR2 m dose. At an MOI of 100, the AdshCAR2 m treatment led to reduction of CoxB3 titers by 66 and 90%, whereas at an MOI of 25, CoxB3 titers were reduced by only 16 and 34% on days 6 and 8, respectively (Figure 7b ). Similar results were obtained when AdshCAR2 m -transduced PNCMs (MOI of 100) were infected with adenovirus.

Antiviral efficacy of CAR silencing by RNA interference H Fechner et al studies. [5] [6] [7] [13] [14] [15] Despite encouraging results, however, several reports have revealed a fundamental general problem of siRNA-based antiviral therapy. Owing to the requirement for strict sequence-specificity between therapeutic siRNA and target mRNA, even single point mutations in the viral target sequence may result in the rapid selection of escape mutants during persistent viral infections. [17] [18] [19] In this study, we show that inhibition of CoxB3 and adenovirus infections is possible via silencing of the CAR receptor by means of vector-generated CAR-shRNA. This strategy is an attractive alternative to siRNA-based silencing of virus-encoded gene, because it drastically reduces the probability of escape mutant development. 22 In contrast to previous work, 15 our investigations were carried out in myocardial cells representing the actual targets for CoxB3 and adenovirus infections in acute myocarditis and inflammatory cardiomyopathy. 32 Treatment of HL-1 cells with the shCAR vector led to efficient and stable removal of mCAR protein from the cell surface, and consequently, to significant inhibition of CoxB3 and adenovirus infection of these cells. Remarkably, adenovirus internalization was reduced by only E75% despite the near-complete silencing of mCAR expression, whereas CoxB3 infection was inhibited by up to 97%. In contrast, CAR silencing in PNCMs resulted in strong inhibition of both adenovirus and CoxB3 infections (by 92 and 90%, respectively). Adenovirus binding to cells is not exclusively mediated by CAR. Type 2 and 5 adenoviruses use CAR to attach to the cell surface, 33 whereas its internalization occurs through a v b 1 , a v b 3 and a v b 5 integrin. 29, 34, 35 Others have shown that heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans and major histocompatibility complex class I molecules may also be involved in the binding of adenoviruses 2 and 5. 36, 37 Moreover, the expression of receptors involved in adenovirus infections is highly variable between different cell types and tissues. 38 Thus, variable receptor expression levels and interactions of adenoviruses with cell type-specifically expressed alternative receptors are the most likely explanation for the failure of complete CAR silencing to achieve efficient blockade of adenovirus infection in HL-1 cells. To enhance efficacy in inhibition of adenovirus infection via the anti-receptor approach, it seems to be necessary to simultaneously inhibit CAR and its co-receptors.",

The molecular reason for the differences of anti-CAR treatment in adenovirus versus CoxB3 infections may be the unique role played by CAR during CoxB3 infection as it induces conformational changes in the virus capsid that are essential for CoxB3 entry into the target cell. 27 The high efficacy of the shCAR vector against this virus indicates that CAR silencing is a promising therapeutic approach against CoxB3 infections of the myocardium. Previous studies have shown a similar degree of inhibition when using siRNAs directed against CoxB3 viral genomic RNA or its RNA intermediate. 14, 15, 39 Combination of direct antiviral approaches, which are prone to escape mutant development with the current anti-receptor strategy, is likely to further increase the efficacy of RNAi-based antiviral therapy.",

This difference should be the result of high transduction efficacy of AdVs and the prolonged high-level expression of the shCAR. A bottleneck of chemically synthesized siRNAs is its transient silencing activity of E3 days in cardiac cells. 28 Viral vectors expressing shRNAs, however, enable long-term silencing of target genes in cells of cardiac origin 40 and allow efficient delivery of transgenic sequences to the heart. 41, 42 Among the currently available viral vectors, pseudotyped AAV9 vectors appear to be most promising for cardiac gene therapy as they allow highly efficient 49 kDa 43, 44 CAR is a cell adhesion protein mediating homotypic 45, 46 and heterotypic 47 intercellular interactions. It is a component of specialized intercellular junctions including epithelial tight junctions, 45 neuro-muscular junctions 48 and myocardial intercalated discs. 49 We found it to be localized exclusively at cell-to-cell contact sites between HL-1 cells, possibly as a consequence of cell membrane-associated CAR stabilization through homotypic (CAR-CAR) or heterotypic (CAR-protein) intercellular protein interactions. In contrast to previous CAR silencing attempts using synthetic siRNAs, the newly developed viral vectors AdshCAR4 m and Ad-shCAR2 m achieved near complete and stable knockout of CAR. This was an essential prerequisite to reveal significantly different kinetics of CAR protein ablation in different cell types, in particular, an unexpectedly high stability of CAR in primary cells versus a stable cell line. These data may be explained by cell type-specific CAR protein kinetics, but differential CAR-mRNA stability or CAR-shRNA processing through the cellular micro-RNA/shRNA machinery also need to be taken into account. The delayed downregulation of CAR following vector-mediated CAR-shRNA delivery in primary cardiomyocytes is relevant for in vivo investigations because the time lag between vector application and CAR silencing needs to be considered in the development of antiviral therapy protocols.",

During organogenesis, CAR is highly expressed in the heart, but rapidly downregulated post partum. 50 In a recently published genomic mouse knockout model, cardiomyocyte-specific CAR deletion resulted in severe cardiac anomalies and death between days 11.5 and 13.5 of embryonal development. 51, 52 If the CAR gene became ablated late in embryonic development, however, the CAR-deficient animals survived into adulthood and had no evident cardiac anomalies. 51 This finding suggests that CAR silencing by RNAi, as employed in our study, should be well tolerable over considerable periods of time, during which virus migration and spreading were efficiently inhibited. Furthermore, treatment of HL-1 cells with AdV-generated shCAR revealed no side effects as we found no changes in cell growth, cell morphology or F-actin cytoskeleton protein expression (not shown). As CAR is a component of tight junctions and may play a permanent role in tissue function of several organs, further experiments have to examine if CAR knockdown by RNAi has no side effects in vivo even over prolonged treatment times.",
