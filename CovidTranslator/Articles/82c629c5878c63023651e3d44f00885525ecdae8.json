Despite SL-CoVs and SARS-CoV share identical genome structure and high-level sequence similarity, SL-CoV does not bind to the same cellular receptor as for SARS-CoV and the N-terminus of the S proteins only share 64% amino acid identity, suggesting there are fundamental differences between these two groups of coronaviruses. To gain insight into the basis of this difference, we established a recombinant adenovirus system expressing the S protein from SL-CoV (rAd-Rp3-S) to investigate its immune characterization. Our results showed that immunized mice generated strong humoral immune responses against the SL-CoV S protein. Moreover, a strong cellular immune response demonstrated by elevated IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6 levels was also observed in these mice. However, the induced antibody from these mice had weaker cross-reaction with the SARS-CoV S protein, and did not neutralize HIV pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein. These results demonstrated that the immunogenicity of the SL-CoV S protein is distinct from that of SARS-CoV, which may cause the immunological differences between human SARS-CoV and bat SL-CoV. Furthermore, the recombinant virus could serve as a potential vaccine candidate against bat SL-CoV infection.",

The S protein of SARS-CoV is responsible for binding the cellular receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [19] , and mediates viral entry [6, 16, 28] . Additionally, the S protein induces protective humoral and cellular responses in the host [4, 5, 10, 11, 13-15, 21, 32, 34, 37] . For the bat SL-CoV S protein, by using the HIV-pseudotyped SARS-CoV and SL-CoV S protein, we have demonstrated that SL-CoV could not use ACE2 as its receptor.",

However, the induced antibody had weaker cross-reaction with the HIV-pseudotyped SARS-CoV S protein; neither neutralized the pseudovirus. ELISPOT assay found that the secretion levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6 in the rAd-Rp3-S immunized mice were higher than that of the negative control, demonstrating that the cellular immune responses were also elicited in the rAd-Rp3-S immunized mice.

ELISA results showed that the specific antibody against HIV/BJ01-S or HIV/ Rp3-S was detected in rAd-Rp3-S immunized mouse sera on the 14 th day, the titer boosted dramatically after day 28 and was 10-fold higher than that in rAd-GFP immunized mice by day 42; no specific antibody responses were found at detectable levels in negative control groups, rAd-GFP or PBS immunized mice (Fig. 2) . Further, the antibody titer against HIV/Rp3-S was much higher than that against HIV/BJ01-S in rAd-Rp3-S immunized mice. These results indicated that the specific antibody against SL-CoV S protein and the weaker cross with SARS-CoV S protein were generated in rAd-Rp3-S immunized mice.",

            "text": "The splenocytes of the immunized mice that were harvested on the eighth week were used to detect the secretion levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-6 by ELISPOT assay. [20] . The RBD of SARS-CoV S protein contains neutralizing epitopes and can induce neutralizing antibodies [5, 10, 13, 14] . The minor mutations in the S protein, particularly the receptor binding domain (RBD), abolished viral entry into the susceptible cells and failed to induce cross-protection neutralizing antibodies [12, 35] . An important difference between the bat SL-CoV and SARS-CoV S proteins occurs in the RBD, the RBD of bat SL-CoV S protein has two deletions (5 and 12-13 aa, respectively). This important difference led to different usage of the cellular receptor between SARS-CoV and SL-CoV; the bat SL-CoV cannot use ACE2 as its receptor [26] . Our current study further demonstrated that the divergence between the SARS-CoV and SL-CoV S protein also may cause the antibody induced by SL-CoV S protein to have a weaker cross reaction with SARS-CoV S protein and such that it did not neutralize HIV/ BJ01-S. Cellular immune responses are very important for host defense against the viral infection. IFN-\u03b3 is synthesized almost exclusively by activated natural killer (NK) and T cells in response to viral infection [24] . IL-6 plays a central role in both innate and acquired immune response. In our study, high secretion level of IFN-\u03b3 (120 cells per 10 6 cells) and IL-6 (160 cells per 10 6 cells) in rAd-Rp3-S immunized mice splenocytes, indicated that both Th1 and Th2 cells were elicited in rAd-Rp3-S immunized mice. Similar responses have been observed in SARS patients and animal models, for example, the level of IFN-\u03b3 in SARS patients at the early stages of disease onset correlated with resolution of the viral infection [29] , and IL-6 was up-regulated as a consequence of being induced by SARS-CoV S protein in murine macrophages [31] .",

In this study, we successfully constructed a recombinant adenovirus containing the full length codon-optimized S gene of the bat SL-CoV. The recombinant virus, rAd-Rp3-S, elicited strong antibody response in mice against SL-CoV S protein, but a low cross reaction with SARS-CoV (BJ01 isolate) S protein and failed to neutralize the HIV/BJ01-S protein. These results indicate that the recombinant virus can induce a specific antibody response against bat SL-CoV S protein in a mice model and the bat SL-CoV S protein has different immune responses from that of SARS-CoV. These results are consistent with our previous results that bat sera naturally infected by SL-CoV could not neutralize the human SARS-CoV",
