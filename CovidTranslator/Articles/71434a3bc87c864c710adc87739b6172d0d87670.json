Articles on pathogens in two families of positive strand RNA viruses, the flaviviruses and coronaviruses, and in three families of negative strand RNA families, the orthomyxoviruses, filoviruses, and rhabdoviruses, were included. Vaccines for many of these viruses are not available, or vaccine efficacy is moderate. Members of each family constitute a major clinical need for effective therapeutics, but drug development efforts against these pathogens are at very different stages and the desirable drug profiles are distinct.",

The recent emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) suggests that additional zoonotic coronaviruses will continue to periodically emerge into the human population in the future. Nucleotide and nucleoside analogue inhibitors have been developed for use against many RNA viruses. However, the unique RNA-dependent RNA proofreading activity of the CoV 3 0 to 5 0 exoribonuclease is responsible for increased resistance of these viruses to nucleotide and nucleoside analogue inhibitors. Pruijssers and Denizen [1] describe the recent development of nucleotide and nucleoside analogue inhibitors with the ability to inhibit multiple CoVs.",

These include the use of different host proteins for virion attachment and entry, different protease structures that affect drug targeting and the lack of an NS5A protein for the members of the genus Flavivirus. Efficacious antiviral drugs targeting nonstructural proteins of members of the genus Flavivirus have so far not been developed. Zou and Shi [3] review the strategies being used to discover antiviral drugs for Zika virus. Different arthropod-borne flaviviruses cause different diseases and the target population must be considered when developing antiviral drugs. The need for antiviral drugs to treat Zika virus infections in pregnant women to prevent congenital defects in the developing fetus significantly limits the types of drugs that can be used.",

Within the selected group of negative strand viruses, the influenza viruses are responsible for the highest incidence rate by far. In interpandemic years, they cause acute respiratory infections with the highest disease burden in the elderly. Major efforts have been directed at the development of influenza therapeutics and last year the first new inhibitor class in nearly two decades was approved for human use, although the standard-of-care drugs are still the neuraminidase inhibitors. The article by O'Hanlon and Shaw [4] discusses the development and possible clinical impact of the novel influenza virus PA endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil with particular emphasis on clinical trial data and the prospect of emerging viral resistance to inhibition. The discussion summarizes how approval of baloxavir marboxil has redefined priorities within the influenza drug development field towards proactively addressing the resistance problem at the discovery stage and exploring combination therapy options.",

Spanning an arc from animal models of influenza to clinical data, the authors discuss the current insights into the correlation between biological sex and immune responses to influenza virus infection and the efficacy of vaccines and antiviral drugs.

Drug development efforts against filovirus infections received a major boost by the unusually large 2013-2016 outbreak in West Africa that resulted in over 11 000 casualties and the spread of disease to both Europe and North America. After an overview of the filovirus replication cycle, Edwards and Basler [6] provide a succinct overview of the current stage of experimental filovirus inhibitors and drug candidates undergoing clinical testing. Both direct-acting and host-targeted antiviral candidates are discussed, reflecting the need for the development of broad-spectrum panfilovirus inhibitors.",

Brinton is a Regents Professor in the Department of Biology at Georgia State University. Her research is focused on flavivirus and arterivirus host cell interactions and replication mechanisms. Specific research areas for flaviviruses include functional analysis of the alleles of a mouse gene that confers resistance/susceptibility to flavivirus-induced disease, characterization of interactions between viral genome RNA structures and pro-viral host proteins and analysis of cellular innate immune and stress responses induced or counteracted by flavivirus infections. Her research on the arterivirus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, is focused on delineating mechanisms regulating subgenomic mRNA abundance and on analyzing viral protein functions. Her lab has tested multiple candidate antiviral drugs against flaviviruses and arteriviruses.",
