Histological changes, blood gases, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) and wet-todry weight were analyzed to evaluate lung injury after smoke inhalation; beside, we also measured the expression of ACE and ACE2 at different time points to explore the possible mechanism of those changes. The results showed that pH of arterial blood, partial blood oxygen (PaO 2 ) and blood oxygen saturation (SO 2 ) decreased after smoke inhalation at different time points (P < 0.01); while, partial blood carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ), wet-to-dry weight ratio, leukocytes count, protein concentration and inflammatory cytokines in BALF increased after smoke exposure (P < 0.01). More importantly, both immunohistochemical staining and Western blot results showed that ACE and ACE2 expression in lungs from the experimental groups significantly increased compared with that of the control group (P < 0.05). This study indicated that inflammation pulmonary edema and histological changes resulted from smoke inhalation induced lung injury were possibly attributed to abnormal expression of ACE and ACE2 related pathway.",

The possible mechanism maybe associated with large inflammatory cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes and platelets,and proinflammatory mediators, including cytokines, proteases, oxidants neuromediator, cyclooxygenase and procoagulantfactors [6] . However, large-scale trials on ARDS have not found effective pharmacologic therapy for improving the clinical outcome. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a key role in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance [7] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 share homology in their catalytic domain. ACE activity triggers vasoconstriction by generating angiotensin II from angiotensin I, while ACE2 counterbalances with ACE and functions as a negative regulator of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) [8] . Previous reports indicate that the RAS also plays a critical role in acute lung diseases, especially acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Researches showed that ACE2 knock-out mice could be protected from SARS infection [9] . Besides, researches in acid-aspiration-induced ARDS, endotoxin-induced ARDS and peritoneal sepsis-induced ARDS showed that ACE, angiotensin (Ang) II type I (AT 1) receptor, acts as lung injury-prompting factor, whereas ACE2 protects against that kind of lung injury [10, 11] . Recent report that ACE2 could mediate the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by influenza A (H7N9) virus infection in an experimental mouse model [12] . These findings suggested that RAS may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ARDS and might facilitate the development of a novel drug target for ARDS.",

There were 6 rats in each group. Smoke inhalation induced lung injury models were built according to the method described by Zhu et al. [13] . Briefly, 150 g of dry wood shavings and 30 ml of kerosene were mixed thoroughly in a pot. This material was then heated to produce smoke. Using an air blower, the smoke was wafted from the pot to a 20 cm \u00c2 20 cm \u00c2 20 cm holding cage. This cage was kept at a temperature of 35 AE 2 8C and was equipped with transparent glass on the top with a light/(bulb) in each of the four corners. The transparent glass provided visibility for the determination of the optimum smoke density, which, for the purposes of this experiment, was characterized as the point at which the holding cage was full of white smoke that was thick enough to blur the bottom of the holding cage. After the cage was filled with smoke, 24 rats were placed in the holder for 10 min, and subsequently taken out of the holder for 5 min. This cycle was repeated three times. Animals were given a daily dose of buprenorphene (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) for analgesia starting immediately after the injury. The rats were anesthetized with 25 mg/kg of 1% pentobarbital by intraperitoneal injection and were sacrificed by cervical dislocation at the end of the experimental time period.",

In the current research, we successfully established smoke-induced acute respiratory distress in adult The severity of lung injury was scored by the criteria of edema, neutrophil infiltration, hemorrhage, bronchiole epithelial desquamation, and hyaline membrane formation.

There is a wide range in the type and severity of lung injury due to the different source of smoke and duration of exposure. In order to evaluate the initial and dynamic inflammatory mechanism in the acute stage, we examined the concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-a and IL-6 in BALF. The results showed that cytokinemediated inflammatory cascade was likely to play a key role in the pathogenesis of ARDS [16] . Moreover, the degree of inflammation gradually exacerbated at different time points in the first 24 h. Based on those findings, we assumed that the phenotypes of lung injury in smoke inhalation were partly related to the accumulation of inflammatory factor [17] . Pathology testing showed that, in smoke inhalationinduced injury, the initial harm was mostly to the trachea and bronchi, characterized by mucosal hyperemia and increased microvascular permeability, exfoliation of the epithelial lining, mucous secretion, mucous plugging, and an acute inflammatory cell influx [18] . There was an increase in microvascular pressure and permeability to both large (proteins) and small (electrolytes, water, and glucose) molecules after smoke inhalation [19] . As it progresses, ARDS may result in widespread pulmonary vascular damage, which commonly produces pulmonary hypertension [20] . There was also a marked lose of functional pulmonary vessels resulted from a combination of intense vasoconstriction, interstitial edema and thromboembolism [20] .",

In recent decades, RAS has been thought to be essential in maintaining blood pressure homeostasis, as well as fluid and salt balance [21] . However, the latest evidence suggested that activation of a pulmonary RAS might influence the pathogenesis of ARDS via such mechanisms as inflammation, vascular permeability, vascular tone, and fibroblast activity [22] . ACE and ACE2 have been known as the key members in the classical renin-angiotensin system. The lungs are major organs that express Ang II and ACE in human beings and mice. ACE2 is the first human homolog of ACE discovered and isolated from human cDNA libraries prepared from ventricular and lymphoma tissues [23, 24] . The enzyme of ACE2 Exhibits 42% sequence identity and 61% sequence similarity to ACE. Like ACE, ACE2 is membrane-bound, but it is a monocarboxypeptidase that generates Ang (1-9) from the decapeptide Ang I and generates Ang (1-7) from AngII [20] . ACE2 plays dual roles by both degrading the vasoconstrictor Ang II and producing the vasodilator Ang (1-7) [25] . Moreover, Su et al. [26] have reported that Ang (1-7) antagonizes Ang IImediated cell signaling and limits Ang II-induced expression of transforming growth factor-b1.",

Idell et al. [29] found that ARDS patients had elevated ACE levels in bronchoalveolar lavage. Orfanos [30] have also reported that the pulmonary capillary endothelium-bound ACE activity correlated with the severity of lung injury in the patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Recent retrospective epidemiological studies demonstrated that pretreatment of an ACE inhibitor was associated with decreased mortality in patients hospitalized with community-acquired pneumonia [31] . Besides, Imail et al. [11] have investigated the role of ACE2 in ARDS using ace2 knockout mice. Loss of ACE2 expression in mutant mice also resulted in enhanced vascular permeability, increased lung edema, accumulation of neutrophil, and worsened lung function. The negative regulation of Ang II levels by ACE2 accounts, in part, for the protective function of ACE2 in ARDS. Additionally, there were large differences in plasma ACE concentrations between individuals but are similar concentrations within families [32] , which suggested the genetic susceptibility of ACE to ARDS.",

From these results, we also concluded that, because of the noxious substances that were inhaled, the lung injury became much more severe with the time, and then ACE in the lung was generated and delivered to the periphery unceasingly, which would provoke a gradual increase in the Ang II in the lung. Ang II accumulation in the pulmonary capillary wall plays an important dual role in hemodynamics and unhemodynamics. In hemodynamics, up regulated Ang II may cause pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary arterial pressure upgrading, and the increase of pneumoangiogram permeability. In Ang II unhemodynamics, in addition to taking part in the extracellular constituent accumulating in the local lung, Ang II may promote the infiltration of monocytes/macrophages and encourage transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1) secretion, leading to more severe lung injury and the formation of pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis. In order to improve these reactions, the body increases the levels of ACE2 and vasodilating Ang (1-7) to restrain Ang II action in vivo. The ACE level is proportional to the amount of tissue Ang II available, and ACE2 may counterbalance the Ang II-promoting effects of ACE in tissue.",

In order to explore novel therapeutic targets for lung injury, it is necessary in the future experiment to evaluate the treatment effect by utilizing pharmacological agents such as ACE2 agonists, ACE inhibitors or Ang II AT seen, corresponding to rat ACE and rat ACE2, respectively. The ACE and ACE2 content were dramatically increased in rat lungs immediately after smoke inhalation injury as compared to normal lungs.",
