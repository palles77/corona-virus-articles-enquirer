The low inter-assay coefficient of variation recorded demonstrated that this method is highly repeatable. Compared with SPF cats, cytokine production was upregulated in most of the samples from FCoV-positive non-symptomatic cats. The appearance of a case of FIP in the cattery was associated with an increased expression of cytokines, in particular there was an increased production of IL-1b and IFN-g, suggesting that these cytokines might protect infected cats from the disease. This hypothesis was also supported by the low levels of IFN-g recorded in blood from cats with FIP.",

            "text": "Studies on cytokine profiles in cats with feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), a fatal disease induced by feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) provided controversial results (Goitsuka et al 1990 , Gunn-Moore et al 1998 , Dean et al 2003 , Kiss et al 2004 , and no information is available about cytokine profiles of non-symptomatic naturally FCoV-infected cats, which are known to have clinicopathological changes consistent with a cytokine-induced protective immunity (Paltrinieri et al 2003 , Giordano et al 2004 . The majority of these studies were performed on tissue homogenates or on purified, isolated cell populations like peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (Leutenegger et al 1999 , Kipar et al 2001 . However, this approach provides only limited information about cell interactions that, in vivo, define cytokine production. Furthermore, some authors have demonstrated that cell separation procedures can influence the mRNA levels of cytokines: the isolation of PBMC by density gradient separation increases the expression of mRNAs for IL-2, IL-4 and TNF-a (H\u00e4rtel et al 2001) , while IFN-g is higher in whole blood compared to PBMCs from the same individual (Stordeur et al 2002) . The use of whole blood can be thus considered an alternative method to evaluate cytokine profiles. This approach reduces both the time and costs associated with cell isolation and purification, requires minimal sample manipulation, and, above all, the data obtained reflect more accurately in vivo events. Whole blood cultures have been extensively used in human medicine (Ham et al 1991 , Allen et al 1992 , but rarely in veterinary medicine (Yancy et al 2001 , Duvigneau et al 2003 . To our knowledge, there are no studies about evaluation of cytokine expression directly on feline whole blood.",

The cattery was managed in order to provide physical separation of cats with specific problems (pregnancies, parturitions, infectious diseases, etc) while asymptomatic cats shared the same environment. Sporadic cases of FIP (1e4 per year) occurred in the cattery in past years, suggesting that the cattery might be considered endemically infected by FCoV. As in most cats living in this environment the colonisation of intestine by FCoVs may be cyclic (Addie and Jarrett 2001) , these cats were sampled at intervals ranging from 1 to 3 months in order to assess the possible relationship between the cytokine pattern and the actual FCoV status. Specifically, five samples (T1eT5) were collected from cats A and D and four samples were collected from cats B (which was not sampled at T4) and C (which was not sampled at T3). The intervals between samples were 90 days from T1 to T2, 35 days from T2 to T3 and from T3 to T4 and 70 days from T4 to T5. Cases of FIP occurred 12 days after sampling 3 and 30 days after sampling 5. Group 2: Three cats affected by FIP. One of them came from a Maine Coon breeding cattery, the others were two domestic shorthairs living in multi-cat households on which cases of FIP were recorded in the past. All these cats showed clinical signs consistent with FIP. They were sampled just before euthanasia, and then they were submitted for necropsy. In all these three cases, the clinical suspicion of FIP was confirmed by post-mortem examinations that included necropsy, histology and immunohistochemistry for FCoV-antigens, performed as already described (Paltrinieri et al 2003) . Group 3: Three SPF cats permanently kept at the animal facility of the Vetsuisse Faculty of the University of Zurich. At the time of sampling these cats were clinically healthy and did not show any haematological or biochemical abnormalities.",

Ten microlitres of reaction product were visualised on a 1.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide and an image of the gel was digitally photographed on an ultraviolet transilluminator. Gel images were then subjected to quantisation of band intensity using a free-download dedicated software (Quantity One Basic Software, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The mean band intensity was calculated after background subtraction. For each sample, we identified the dilutions that showed a comparable intensity (coefficient of variation within each run of less than 10%), which were then used to perform PCR for all cytokines. Thus, we ensured comparable amounts of starting cDNA material were used and minimised the possibility that differences in cytokine levels were due to methodological variability.",

It has been reported that standard RT-PCR has the same reproducibility for relative quantification of mRNA as for other methods like competitive RT-PCR (Hall et al 1998) . Finally, the use of specific software to calculate band intensity is an easy and frequently used method for semi-quantitative analysis of digitalised gel images (Harley et al 1999 , Yancy et al 2001 , Duvigneau et al 2003 . For these reasons we used a traditional RT-PCR technique to study cytokine profiles in feline whole blood and we quantified the bands' intensity by image analysis. This method allowed us to obtain repeatable and reliable results, thus indicating that it can be used to compare results from different test sessions. In order to correctly interpret the results, however, it is important to standardise some of the methodological factors: (1) time between blood collection and RNA extraction: it has been reported that cold storage of whole blood poorly affects the amount of RNA extracted, even though it might activate some cell populations (Duvigneau et al 2003) ; nevertheless standardisation of processing times would affect all the samples in a similar manner;",

Using the above described approach, we examined whole blood cytokine profiles in cats with symptomatic and non-symptomatic FCoV infection and in healthy non-FCoV infected SPF cats. The use of SPF cats as a negative control might appear unusual as the immune system of these cats is exposed to stimuli (non-specific infectious agents, environmental stress) different from those of non-SPF cats. On the other hand, the few data available regarding feline cytokines have been recorded in SPF cats (Rottman et al 1995 , Kipar et al 2001 . Moreover, a control group composed by Values are expressed as percentage of the mean intensity of the internal calibrator (500 bp ladder) of each batch. The analysis of the repeatability of the computerised quantification of IL-1b expression was performed by examining mean, standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV). None of the samples included in batch 1 were repeatedly analysed so no columns referring to batch 1 are therefore included in this table.",

This is in agreement with the increases of certain lymphocyte subsets and acute phase proteins (Paltrinieri et al 2003 , Giordano et al 2004 , which might depend on the expression of the above cytokines, in cats that remain healthy when other cats of the cattery develop FIP. The positive correlation between IFN-g expression and lymphocyte percentage might depend on the fact that non-symptomatic FCoV-infected cats have high numbers of CD8\u00fe lymphocytes (Paltrinieri et al 2003) , which can produce high levels of IFN-g (Caruso et al 1998) . All these findings suggest that an intense cytokine production by peripheral blood cells, and specifically an increased expression of IL-1b and IFN-g, might protect FCoV-infected cats from FIP (Kiss et al 2004) . Ultimately, FIP occurs when low pathogenic FCoV strains mutate and acquire the ability to replicate within macrophages, but the probability of mutation depends on the rate of replication of enteric FCoVs (Vennema et al 1998) . It is thus possible that viral replication is lower in cats that mount an efficient immunity. Examples of RT-PCR products for IL-12 p40 (A) IL-4 (B) and IFN-g (C) recorded in FCoV-exposed cats.",

By contrast, the cytokine profiles of cats F and G, which had the wet form, were quite silent: both these cats expressed only low levels of IL-1b and cat F also expressed IL-6. A decreased cytokine expression was already reported, in blood, during experimental infections (Gunn-Moore et al 1998), but it is in contrast with that recorded in tissues (Dean et al 2003 , Foley et al 2003 and in ascites, on which high levels of IL-6 were recorded (Goitsuka et al 1990) . Interestingly, all the cats with FIP had low or absent IFN-g expression. Also IFN-g has been found to be upregulated within lesions (Foley et al 2003 , Berg et al 2005 , but downregulated in blood of cats with FIP (Kiss et al 2004) . Cytokine profiles in blood therefore seem to be different from those in tissues of cats with FIP. Moreover, the low levels of IFN-g recorded in cats with FIP compared with the high levels recorded in FCoV-positive clinically healthy cats supports the hypothesis raised by Kiss et al (2004) about the key role of this molecule in predisposing to or in protecting from FIP. In conclusion, RT-PCR analysis of cytokine patterns in whole blood can be used to evaluate the immune status of cats. The semi-quantitative approach based on the analysis of digitalised gel images provides repeatable results. As the analysis of whole blood is considered to be highly representative of the in vivo situation, our results further support the hypothesis that upregulation of cytokines by blood cells might protect FCoV-infected cats from FIP, while downregulation of cytokines (and especially of IFN-g) is associated with FIP. These results must be verified by larger and well controlled studies to investigate both the role of cytokines in FCo-Vehost interactions and the possibility to use cytokine profiles to identify cats susceptible or resistant to FIP.",
