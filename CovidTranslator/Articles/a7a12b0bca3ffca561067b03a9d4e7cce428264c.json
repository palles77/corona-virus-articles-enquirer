Previous studies represent view either by simple pictorial description of a scene, or by rather sophisticated mathematical methods. Both hinder proper allocation of a premium for different view obstruction levels for high-rise high-density urban environments. View obstruction level and the applicable premium are useful information for stakeholders of the property market for making optimum decisions. Accordingly, there is a need to develop a simple parameter for assessing view obstruction level. While view is difficult to define, reference is made to law cases which often settle view disputes by the extent of daylight obstruction. Shading mask is typically used to assess availability of daylight outside a residential unit and hence is an ideal parameter for assessing view obstruction. Computation of shading mask values (SMK) is a very complex task that needs meticulous site surveys, 3D drafting skills, and computer simulations. They are too effort intensive for stakeholders. This paper summarizes the relevant considerations and the case studies conducted to establish the average angle of unobstructed sky (q) as a simple parameter to represent mean SMK for assessing view obstruction. Correlation analysis of mean SMK of 708 case study residential units determined by the detailed computer simulation method and the corresponding angle of unobstructed sky showed that the latter can be used to assess view obstruction adequately close to simulation predictions. Given average angle of unobstructed sky can easily be determined based on the geometrical primitives of a residential unit, this can enable future allocation of a premium for different view obstruction levels for stakeholders.",

Influence of these factors has been subject to much study. One important factor, particularly in high priced dwellings in cities like Hong Kong (Kalra, Mihaljek, & Duenwald, 2000) , is the view that can be seen from a residential unit. It has been accepted that homebuyers are willing to pay more for a scenic view; a good view can increase the market price of an apartment by anywhere between 8% and 60%. However, most studies represent views by pictorial description of a scene, such as landscape, lake, and ocean views (Rodriguez & Sirmans, 1994; Tse & Lovem, 2000) . Only some have carefully defined the quality of view to allocate a premium on value. Brown and Pollakowski (1977) found that a shorter distance from the waterfront significantly increased house price in Seattle. Benson, Hansen, Schwartz, and Smersh (1998) made an attempt to classify sea views into 4 performance levels ranging from full sea view to poorer partial sea view.",

            "text": "Recent advances in laser ranging combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) facilitate the use of viewshed analysis for a more precise and objective measure of view obstruction for each property to circumvent previous view classifications (Hamilton & Morgan, 2010) . In constructing viewshed variables, information of the built landscape features of the subject property is required. This is less of a problem for a new development, or for urban and natural resource planning. It is difficult to capture a residential unit's view obstruction due to poor availability of high resolution spatial data for buildings, especially their locations and heights, which are rarely reflected in commonly available maps; collecting these data can be complicated because of the time, effort and expense involved (Sander & Manson, 2007) . Furthermore, a viewshed analysis basically assesses the visibility of a viewpoint for an area of interest (view) . A value of unity indicates that the viewpoint is visible, while a value of zero indicates that the viewpoint is not visible (Kim, Rana, & Wise, 2004) . In high-density urban developments like Hong Kong, uniform high-rise buildings are closely packed to create a solid wall-effect that blocks the view (Giridhara, Ganesan, & Lau, 2004) . As such, even when spending is allowed, the variation in viewshed value will be too small to provide a precise measure of view obstruction. This explains why viewshed analysis, if conducted to measure a property's views, is confined to property developments where there is an unobstructed distinguished view nearby (Germino, Reiners, Blasko, McLeod, & Bastian, 2001) .",

It is noted that most building environmental assessment schemes in use nowadays combine views and overshadowing performance as a single assessment criterion to assess impact of neigbouring buildings in respect of access to daylight and views (HK-BEAM, 2004; LEED, 2008) . Several lawsuits have also combined the obstruction of view and light by neigbouring obstacles as into one single complaint (CPC, 2010; Law Letter, 1995) . In Hong Kong, site planners and architects adopt a simplified method called the unobstructed vision area (UVA) method, originally developed for quantifying the visible sky area (Ng, 2003) , to demonstrate compliance with performance-based requirements of daylight availability in buildings (BD, 2010), though proper application of the UVA method is subject to many constraints (Cheung & Chung, 2007; Chung & Cheung, 2006) .

The equal angle approach uses altitude and azimuth values to index the shading mask, which is often considered a simpler method (Marsh, 2005) . Obviously, the smaller the size of each segment, the greater will be the accuracy of calculations. CIE (1994) suggested that for daylight calculations, segments with a solid angle of approximately 0.2 radians, i.e. 11.5 degree, are small enough to be considered as point sources without significant error. Reference is also made to a computer simulation package HTB2 adopting the shading mask concept to estimate the inter-shadowing effect on solar heat gain through windows and on conduction heat transfer through envelope (Alexander, 1994) . In HTB2, 10 degree segments are used. This corresponds to the 324 equal area segments (i.e. 0e360 from azimuth, and 0e90 horizon to zenith). For a given surface and any given set of obstructions, the shading mask can be recorded in a shading mask table comprising 36 rows and 9 columns.",

The overshadowing accuracy and the azimuth and altitude increment were set at medium and 2.0, respectively. It was determined after trial simulations with changed settings, in order to observe the influence on shading mask values. Detailed description of Ecotect simulation can be found on the product website (Marsh, 2010) . In preparation for the simulation, a scaled three-dimensional (3D) model of the target building, together with the neighboring buildings and other external objects and structures within a circumference of 500 m were drawn by using AutoCAD. AutoCAD was used because it is popular in the construction industry, and is compatible with Ecotect. The site boundary was determined based on findings of Chau, Wong, and Yiu (2005) , indicating that a view with a premium refers to the panoramic view within 500 m of the living This is consistent with distance zone suggested by other studies (Bishop & Hulseb, 1994; Leeds et al., 2008) . As for the target unit, the apertures and the fenestration details including fins and canopy were precisely drawn (Fig. 1) , while other surfaces were modeled as flat planes. On exporting the AutoCAD files to Ecotect, a shading mask table for each window surface is generated. In this study, window pane position was assumed the standing position for a specific view. Given correlation between the subjective levels of view and transaction prices was confirmed, to preliminarily evaluate if the mean shading mask \u00f0SMK\u00de can be used to quantify view obstruction, attempts have been made to identify if there is a link among SMK, subjective view obstruction level, and transaction price. Reference was made to transaction records of Royal Ascot (Table 2) . SMK values of the 67 residential units appeared in the transaction record were computed for Pearson correlation and cluster analyses. Pearson correlation result (\u00bc0.564) indicates that correlation between SMK values and transaction prices is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed). Cluster analysis results are shown in Table 3 . It can be seen that with the exception of two cases, the clustered group number based on the transaction prices and SMK values aligned with the subjective view obstruction levels. The SMK values and transaction prices are also comparable to confirm the link.",

The calculation results are compared with subjective view levels determined in the previous section (Table 4) , which indicates that: SMK values for the four view levels are compared in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the SMK ranged between 0.127 and 0.37, which ",

Thus assessing solar component for a window does provide a quick and simple guide to the potential for daylight to satisfy the intended objectives of this study.

There are 8 units on each floor. As can be seen from the site layout in Fig. 5 , Taikoo Shing was built along the seafront, where northern and northeastern sides of the development are facing an ocean and a park. The other orientations are bounded by the neighboring buildings. Taikoo Shing was chosen because the flat sizes (ranging from 55 m 2 to 110 m 2 ) are comparable to those of Royal Ascot (ranging from 69 m 2 to 150 m 2 ). As such, the overall block dimensions are similar. Furthermore, Taikoo Shing is equally popular among buyers and speculators. For a significant time in the 1980s and 1990s, Taikoo Shing's house prices were a general indicator of Hong Kong's housing market health in general.

The properties transaction record of four representative residential developments in Hong Kong in 2005 and the pictorial view of each residential unit in the record were reviewed. It was confirmed that there is a correlation between property price and view obstruction in Hong Kong. On the basis of the findings, it is recommended that for high-rise high-density urban environments like Hong Kong, where the view obstruction level differs only slightly among residential units, view should be represented by daylight obstruction to enable scientific allocation of a premium for view obstruction. Accordingly, shading mask was adopted to assess view obstruction. Case studies were conducted to confirm that the mean shading mask value \u00f0SMK\u00de can be effectively used to represent the subjective view obstruction level of a residential unit as checked from 1:1000 digital maps and by site visits. Along the conceptual background of shading mask, a simple parameter, i.e. the average angle of obstruction \u00f0q\u00de, which can be determined based on the geometrical primitives of a residential unit was established as an alternative to shading mask simulations. The SMK and q of 708 residential units randomly selected from two representative residential developments in Hong Kong were determined for a correlation analysis. Comparison of SMK determined by the detailed computer simulation method and the calculated q showed a strong correlation (R 2 \u00bc 0.83 and 0.93). The strong correlation confirmed that q can be used as a simple parameter to assess daylight obstruction of a residential unit. Upon the establishment of q, a monetary value for different view qualities can be more accurately determined. Accordingly, stakeholders will be provided with useful information to enable an objective and continuous evaluation of view obstruction of a residential unit for an optimum decision.",

Given view obstruction is associated with solar access, it will be useful if further research can be conducted to evaluate if q can be used to simultaneously represent view obstruction and solar access. Furthermore, it is important to acknowledge that property price can also affected by other characteristics of a residential unit (e.g. floor area). Further research in this area is also needed.
