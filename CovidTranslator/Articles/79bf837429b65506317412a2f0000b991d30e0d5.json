Clinically, we have found that some patients had initial negative RT-PCR results, but chest CT had typical imaging findings, including ground-glass opacification (GGO) and/or mixed consolidation. Early detection, early diagnosis, early isolation, and early treatment of these cases can effectively control the spread of the epidemic and the emergence of large outbreaks.",

On admission, chest CT scan revealed multiple ground-glass opacities in both lungs, especially the extrapulmonary bands and subpleural distribution (Fig.1 A) . Three RT-PCR assay of the oropharyngeal swab samples were negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. After antiviral (ribavirin) and symptomatic treatment, repeat chest CT showed significant progression of multi-focal ground-glass opacification and mixed consolidation that most appeared at peripheral area of both lungs (Fig.1 B) .

Therefore, the most likely cause of the positive result of the fourth swab test for SARS-CoV-2 is a considerable increase in the amount of virus, which is related to the worsening of the patient's condition. Firstly, the clinical manifestations of the patient showed significant symptoms of high fever, shortness of breath, cough, sputum, and fatigue, compared with that at admission. Secondly, bilateral coarse breath sounds with wet rales distributed at the bases of both lungs were heard on auscultation.",
