A therapeutic drug that is effective against FIP has not yet been developed. Peptides based on viral protein amino acid sequences have recently been attracting attention as new antiviral drugs. In the present study, we synthesized 30 overlapping peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the S1 domain of the type I FIPV strain KU-2 S protein, and investigated their inhibitory effects on FIPV infection. To evaluate the inhibitory effects on type I FIPV infection of these peptides, we investigated a method to increase the infection efficiency of poorly replicative type I FIPV. The efficiency of type I FIPV infection was increased by diluting the virus with medium containing a polycation. Of the 30 peptides, I-S1-8 (S461-S480), I-S1-9 (S471-S490), I-S1-10 (S481-S500), I-S1-16 (S541-S560), and I-S1-22 (S601-S620) significantly decreased the infectivity of FIPV strain KU-2 while I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 exhibited marked inhibitory effects on FIPV infection. The inhibitory effects on FIPV infection of these 2 peptides on other type I and type II FIPV strains, feline herpesvirus (FHV), and feline calicivirus (FCV) were also examined. These 2 peptides specifically inhibited type I and type II FIPV, but did FHV or FCV infection. In conclusion, the possibility of peptides derived from the S protein of type I FIPV strain KU-2 as anti-FIPV agents effective not only for type I, but also type II FIPV was demonstrated in vitro.",

            "text": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) belongs to the alpha coronaviruses of the family Coronaviridae. FCoV is classified into serotypes I and II according to Spike (S) protein properties (Hohdatsu et al., 1991b; Motokawa et al., 1995 Motokawa et al., , 1996 . Each of these types consists of two viruses: feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-causing FIP virus (FIPV) and non-FIP-causing feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Pedersen et al., 1981) . FIPV and FECV of the same serotype cannot be distinguished by their antigenicity or at the gene level, and differ only in their pathogenicity for cats (Pedersen, 2009) . Cats that developed FIP were affected in several organs, including the liver, lungs, spleen, and central nervous system, forming lesions accompanied by necrosis and pyogenic granulomatous inflammation. In some cats, pleural effusion and ascitic fluid accumulated. When anti-FCoV antibody-positive cats are inoculated with FIPV, the onset time of FIP is earlier than that in antibody-negative cats, and symptoms are severer (Baldwin and Scott, 1997; Barlough et al., 1984; Pedersen, 2009; Pedersen et al., 1981; Stoddart et al., 1988; Weiss and Scott, 1981) . These results of experimented studies suggest that antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection can be a serious obstacle to the prevention of FIP by vaccination.",

Peptides based on viral protein amino acid sequences have recently been attracting attention as new antiviral drugs. These peptides bind to viral proteins or receptors on cells and inhibit viral infections. A HIV infection-inhibiting peptide with a HIV-derived sequence is currently used in the human medical field to treat patients with HIV (He, 2013) . This peptide specifically binds to the HIV fusion protein and blocks cell membrane fusion induced by the fusion protein. Furthermore, a peptide with a sequence derived from the RBD of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) specifically binds to the virus receptor on cells and competitively inhibits JEV infection, clarifying that peptides with viral protein-derived sequences inhibit viral infections by binding to the virus and virus receptor (Li et al., 2012 (Li et al., , 2014 . Liu et al. (2013) reported that an FIPV fusion protein-derived peptide exhibited an antiviral effect.

The inhibitory effects of peptides on infections with homologous strain KU-2 were investigated using the plaque assay. Based on the polycation-induced enhancement of infection observed above, MEM containing 25 g/mL of DEAE-dextran was used. fcwf-4 cells were added to culture medium and used to dilute type I FIPV strain KU-2. fcwf-4 cells were then inoculated with these viral suspensions. After allowing 1 h for viral adsorption, the cells were washed, and medium containing 2% FCS and 1.5% carboxymethyl cellulose was added to each well. The cells were cultured at 37 \u2022 C for 2 days and then stained with 1% crystal violet. The plaque formation rate was calculated by the following equation: Percentage of the plaque = {(Number of plaques in a well inoculated with a viral suspension diluted with polycationor polyanion-containing medium/number of plaques in a well inoculated with a viral suspension diluted with medium containing no polycation or polyanion)} \u00d7 100.

The isoelectric points of peptides that inhibited FIPV infection were acidic, particularly, I-S1-8, 9, and 10, suggesting that viral infection was inhibited through reduction of the effect of polycation (DEAE-dextran) by the peptides. Thus, we changed the DEAEdextran concentration and investigated the infection-inhibitory effects of the peptides (Fig. 4) . I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 inhibited viral infection regardless of the DEAE-dextran concentration. In contrast, I-S1-18 did not inhibit infection at any concentration of DEAEdextran, although its isoelectric point was as low as that of I-S1-8.",

To evaluate the inhibitory effects on type I FIPV infection of these peptides, we initially investigated a method to increase the infection efficiency of type I FIPV. To accurately evaluate inhibitory effect on type I FIPV infection, we examined the addition of a polycation or polyanion to a diluted viral suspension. When a viral suspension was diluted with medium containing a polycation and subjected to the infection of fcwf-4 cells, the number of Type I FIPV plaques increased in a manner dependent on the polycation concentration. In contrast, when a viral suspension was diluted with polyanion-containing medium, the number of plaques decreased in a manner dependent on the polyanion concentration. A polycation-induced increase and polyanion-induced decrease in viral infection efficiency have been reported for other viruses, such as TGEV, MHV, and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Bailey et al., 1984; Hirano et al., 1978; Nguyen et al., 1987) . Bailey et al. (1984) demonstrated that positively charged polycations increased electrostatic interactions between viral particles and cell surfaces, promoting the binding of viral particles to the cells. Similarly, the polycation may have enhanced electrostatic interactions between the virus and cell surface and increased type I FIPV infection efficiency.",

The isoelectric points of these peptides were acidic, suggesting that the peptides reduced the effect of the polycation and decreased the number of plaques. However, I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 significantly inhibited type I FIPV strain KU-2 infection regardless of the polycation concentration. Moreover, I-S1-18 showed no infection-inhibitory effect although its isoelectric point was as low as that of I-S1-9. Based on these findings, the infection-inhibitory effect was exhibited regardless of the charge of the peptides. In addition, I-S1-8 and I-S1-10 partially overlapped the amino acid sequence of I-S1-9, and these peptides have similar inhibitory effect as I-S19. In contrast, I-S1-7 (partially overlapping I-S1-8) and I-S1-11 (partially over lapping I-S1-10) did not show inhibitory effect.

            "text": "In the present study, we synthesized overlapping peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the S1 domain of the type I FIPV strain KU-2 S protein, in which the presence of RBD is expected. On the basis of previous reports, the S1 domain of FIPV is expected to involve in RBD (Breslin et al., 2003; Reguera et al., 2012; Regan et al., 2012) . Li et al. reported that a JEV RBD-derived peptide inhibited JEV infection by competitively blocking the binding of JEV to cells (Li et al., 2012 (Li et al., , 2014 . Reguera et al. (2012) reported TGEV RBD. I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 regions, which exhibited inhibitory effects on type I and II FIPV infection, were included in TGEV RBD. In the inhibition test of FIPV adsorption to fcwf-4 cells by I-S1-9, viral binding to fcwf-4 cells was found to be reduced. Based on this result, it was assumed that at least I-S1-9 competitively inhibited viral binding to cells, which significantly decreased FIPV infection efficiency. However, inhibitory effects on FIPV infection were markedly decreased when cells were inoculated with the virus after being pre-sensitized with I-S1-9 and I-S1-16 peptides and washed. These findings indicate that the peptides interact with virus protein, but not with cellular virus receptors. However the data in Fig. 5 could be explained by the internalization of peptide-bound receptor, and replacement by a new population via membrane recycling. Further investigations are beeded to elucidate the action mechanism of these peptides in more detail. S1-9 and I-S1-16 exhibited marked inhibitory effects on type I FIPV infection in the experiment. We investigated the inhibitory effects of these peptides on other type I and II FIPV strains, FHV, and FCV infection. I-S1-9 significantly inhibited both type I and II FIPV infections by 50% or more. I-S1-16 inhibited infections with all type I FIPV strains by 50% or more, but its effect on type II FIPV infection was less than 50%. In a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the S protein among the coronavirus strains, the I-S1-16 amino acid sequence showed 75-80% identity and 90% similarity to type I FIPV, excluding KU-2, but only 20% identity and 30-35% similarity to type II FIPV (Fig. 1) , suggesting that the reduced inhibitory effects of I-S1-16 on type II FIPV infection were attributed to reduced amino acid sequence homology. In contrast, the I-S1-9 amino acid sequence was well conserved between type I and II FIPV. These results suggest that I-S1-9 has broad antiviral activity against feline coronavirus regardless of serotypes. Furthermore, the similarity of the effect between type I and type II FIPV suggests that there is a common receptor binding site for the two viruses. However, previous studies showed that type I and type II FIPV have distinct receptors (Hohdatsu et al., 1998a,b) . The reasons for this discrepancy are unknown. In any case, to elucidate it, identification of the virus receptor for type I FIPV is necessary.",
