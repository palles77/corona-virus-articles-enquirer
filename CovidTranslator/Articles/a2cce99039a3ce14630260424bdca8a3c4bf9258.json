Viruses were initially distinguished from other organisms by their small size and their ability to pass through filters. They were described as \"filterable disease agents\": in other words, infectious agents that are small enough to pass through bacterial filters. Since viruses are quintessential parasites that depend on a host for most of their sustaining functions, logic dictated that viruses also be defined and classified on the basis of the host they infect. However, the host range has proven to be a very complex biological phenomenon with intricacies that are yet to be fully understood. Additionally, not all viruses can be defined as strict parasites given the benefits derived from their association with certain hosts.",

Indeed both the particle and genome sizes of these viruses overlap significantly with those of bacteria, some eukaryotes, and archaea. The discovery called for a definition of viruses based on their essential nature rather than on their size. To this end, one proposal called for the revision of the living world into two major groups of organisms, ribosome-encoding organisms that include all archaea, bacteria and eukarya, and capsid-encoding organisms, the viruses. Clearly, this division distinguishes viruses from cellular organisms based on genome content; in particular, the genes that encode ribosomal proteins and ribosomal RNAs. These genes are among the few genes whose sequences are conserved in all cellular organisms. The last universal common ancestor probably possessed a sophisticated ribosome that contained at least 34 ribosomal proteins that are shared by all archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic organisms. Unlike cellular organisms, viruses lack ribosomes and must use the ribosomes of their host cells for the translation of their mRNA into proteins.",

One striking feature of viral capsids lies in the folded topology of the protein monomers that make up the capsid. The jellyroll \u03b2 barrel appears to be the most prevalent structural core motif among capsid proteins, but it has not been found in any cellular protein. However, numerous groups of viruses share a common evolutionary history with genetic elements that lack a capsid (and its coding gene) and are never encapsidated or, in some cases, encapsidated in the virions of \"host\" viruses. Hence another proposal that has been put forward is a scheme that does not focus on the presence of a capsid or any particular gene, but rather is rooted in the concept of genetic, informational parasitism. That is, viruses are parasitic genetic information; they possess a varied repertoire of replication strategies and establish a range of relationships with cellular hosts that exhibit various degrees of reliance on the information processing systems of the host. In this chapter we first examine the range of biological features of viruses. We later look at the taxonomic classification schemes for viruses, along with specific pitfalls.

It is argued that there are at least 20 unrelated types of capsid proteins in all viruses (and hence, it might be assumed that they evolved independently on different occasions), and that most, if not all, originated from ancestral proteins of cellular organisms. A survey of the protein folds of capsid and nucleocapsid (protein associated with nucleic acids) structures reveals strong similarities in viruses infecting species of different domains of life, which is an indication of their antiquity and of the evolutionary connections among the viruses that encode them. For instance, seven major structural classes encompass more than 60% of the known virosphere. The most prevalent folds in viral capsid proteins are the single jellyroll and the double jellyroll. They can be found in more than a third of the capsid protein folds studied so far. The unique folds of viral capsid proteins present a distinctive geometry and allow effective packaging and virion assembly. In general self-assembly guides the generation of new virions consisting of proteins coded in the virus genome that are synthesized de novo in and by the host. The virion can be formed by a defined number of the same protein (capsomers or nucleocapsid proteins), or by a few different proteins held together by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The virion can also be covered by a lipid envelope, derived from the very host. In some other cases the virion carries an internal membrane situated between the genome and the viral coat. Virions exhibit an amazing diversity in size, and range from 18 to 19 nm (Nanoviridae) to c. 900 nm (Mimiviridae), or even more (i.e., the unrecognized genera Pandoravirus and Pithovirus; the latter are more than 1000 nm in diameter).

            "text": "The majority of viruses adopt the form of a sphere. In this form the capsid is made up of 60 replicas of the same protein(s) that interact spontaneously through template domains at their edges, resulting in an icosahedral structure. This is the simplest icosahedral capsid with a diameter of 20\u00c025 nm. The capsid is composed of 12 pentameric capsomeres, i.e., a total of 60 capsomeres are required to complete the capsid. In larger viruses, more than 60 capsomeres are required to completely encapsidate the genome. The icosahedral capsid of the Rubella virus, e.g., is composed of 12 pentameric and 30 hexameric capsomeres for a total of 240 capsomeres. The diameter of these virions is in the range of 65\u00c070 nm. Some viruses are easily recognizable by the unique arrangements of their capsomeres at the vertices of the icosahedron. For example, virions of members in the family Hepeviridae show a slightly lumpy daisy shape, those of Caliciviridae cup-like indentations, while those of Astroviridae display a remarkable star shape. Other viruses exhibit a multilayered protein capsid morphology, among these FIGURE 2.1 Morphological variability among viruses. In representing the diversity in virion forms, viruses were first grouped according to the possession, or not, of an envelope. Then, hierarchical groups were formed following the most accepted criterion of form (spherical/icosahedral, helical/bacilliform/filamentous, etc.) and where known, the prevalent structural core motif among the capsid proteins (jellyroll, \u03b1 helix, \u03b2 sheet, etc.). The latter is indicated below or at the right side of the photographs; when a particular fold belongs to a class not yet defined, the word \"unknown\" is used. In instances where another protein fold is also found within the group, this information is added beside the family or genus name. For example, filamentous rigid rods of (Continued) are species belonging to the family Reoviridae. Here, the capsids consist of 1\u00c03 layers of protein surrounding the genome core of 9\u00c012 dsRNA segments. Quite a few viruses also have fiber-like structures extending from their surfaces. Adenoviruses have long fibers emanating from its vertices, Sputnik-like virions (e.g., Adenoviridae) have short fibers stemming from every capsomer, and mimiviruses possess a forest of fibers. These virions that lack an envelope are referred to as naked or nonenveloped viruses. Many spherical viruses also have an outer envelope. That is, the capsid of these viruses is surrounded by a lipid bilayer that is derived from host cell membranes and contains viral proteins. These enveloped virions, by virtue of the host-derived lipid bilayer surrounding the virion, present particularities derived from the physical presence of the envelope. Arboviruses (viruses borne by arthropods like those belonging to the families Flaviviridae, Togaviridae, or Phenuiviridae, among others) present as fuzzy spheres possessing a peripheral fringe. HIV-1 carries prominent projections because of viral glycoprotein spikes that protrude from its envelope. The latter virus and other members of the Retroviridae are also described as pleomorphic. Pleomorphic viruses do not follow the rules of symmetry because the lipid envelope readily adopts different shapes and sizes, making each virion unique. Their virions are known to adopt spherical or polygonal structures. The influenza virion is an example. The virions generally take on an irregular shape or may appear spherical or elliptical in shape, ranging from approximately 80\u00c0120 nm in diameter, and are occasionally filamentous, reaching more than 20 \u03bcm in length. Each copy of its eight genomic ssRNA (-) is folded into a rod-shaped, helical nucleocapsid complex referred to as ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP). Along with multiple copies of the viral-encoded nucleoprotein (NP), each RNP contains a heterotrimeric viral polymerase L members belonging to families grouped under nonenveloped viruses (Part 2 of the figure) may present coat proteins with \u03b1-helical motifs, that may be TMV-like or SIRV2-like. An asterisk indicates the specific taxon (family or genus) chosen to represent the morphology of the group. Unknown (not in a gray box) is also used when the presence or absence of an envelope, virion shape or kind of fold has not been reported for a particular family or genus of viruses. Part 6 of the figure presents viruses that do not possess a capsid or viruses for which limited information is available; i.e., families or genera with no further information in terms of form or kind of protein fold, the recently described unique group of viruses (e.g., Tristromaviridae), and a genus that is not fully accepted yet by ICTV (Faustovirus (consisting of PA, PB1, and PB2), and are themselves packaged in a lipid envelope that is derived from the host cell surface membrane. Two glycoproteins encoded by the virus are found in the envelope: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). The most complex architecture of all spherical virions is shown by viruses of the families Myoviridae, Podoviridae and Siphoviridae, of the order Caudovirales, which infect bacteria and archaea. Some species of these three families show a head-tail structure where the icosahedral \"head\" is connected to a specialized host cell attachment structure, the tail, that may be contractile (Myoviridae) or not (the other two families). Three or four subterminal fibers, but more frequently six, may be present on these virions. Members belonging to the Siphoviridae, however, possess a noncontractile tail and never tail fibers. Virions with this type of structure are never enveloped.",

Some filaments are so flexible that they can assume very different shapes. In Filoviridae, e.g., enveloped virions may be simple cylinders (the less frequent form) or form branches or loops. The loops can also vary in form and include the thread-like form (the most general morphotype) as well as U-, 9-, eye-bolt-or Shepperd's crook-shapes, among others.

Various classification schemes were proposed in an attempt to bring to order the apparent diversity, and to facilitate the study of these entities. Early schemes were based solely on size. Viruses were classified as distinct from cellular organisms by virtue of their ability to pass through unglazed porcelain filters known to retain the smallest of bacteria. But as the numbers of filterable agents increased, viruses were distinguished from each other by more measurable characteristics, namely the disease or symptoms caused in an infected host. Under this scheme, e.g., animal viruses that caused hepatitis or jaundice were grouped together as hepatitis viruses and viruses that induced mottling symptoms in plant hosts were grouped together as mosaic viruses.

These mRNAs can be produced from the genome of infecting virus (early mRNAs) or from progeny viral dsDNAs (late mRNAs). The dsDNA-RT viruses are not included in this group, but in group VII (see below). Group II. ssDNA viruses regardless of the genome polarity(ies) (1, 2 , 1 / 2 , and 1 plus 2 ) are included in this group since the production of the mRNAs involves the step of generating dsDNA first. In eukaryotes, virus replication occurs in the nucleus, most probably by a rolling circle mechanism. Group III. dsRNA viruses, as explained previously, produce mRNAs and replication templates by means of their own RdRP. This almost never occurs outside of the virus capsid. Group IV. ssRNA(1) viruses with genomes that are recognized immediately by the host cell machinery as mRNA. Translated proteins subsequently direct the replication of the viral genome. This messenger can be polycistronic, in which case the polyprotein resulting from translation is later cleaved by proteases encoded in the viral genome to give rise to functional viral proteins. In other cases, transcription is more complex and may involve the generation of subgenomic mRNAs, ribosomal (1 or 2 ) frameshifting or proteolytic processing of an initial precursor translation product. Retrotranscribing ssRNA(1) viruses are not included in this group, but in group VI (see later). Group V. ssRNA(2) viruses that must be copied first into a sense RNA molecule in order to produce viral mRNAs. There are two main types of ssRNA(2) depending on where virus replication occurs: those that replicate in the cytoplasm are monopartite and are transcribed by the RdRp to produce the sense molecule that can be translated and serve also as the template for the generation of the minus strand (genomic molecule). And those with segmented genomes that are replicated in the nucleus, in which case separate mRNAs are produced by the viral RdRp resulting in both messenger and replication template molecules. ssRNA (1/ 2 ) viruses are also included in this group. Group VI. ssRNA(1)-RT viruses that, by means of a virus-encoded reverse transcriptase (RT), generate a dsDNA copy of the genomic molecule. This dsDNA molecule is integrated into the genome of the host (becoming a provirus) where it can be replicated and transcribed in the nucleus using the host cell's machinery to provide viral mRNAs as well as ssRNA (1) Altogether, the combination of virion architecture, variations in genome type, number of genomic molecules, and variations of genomic strategies, presence or not of an envelope, host range, and other particularities, makes every virus a unique, evolved construct of nature. The virion provides much information toward the characterization of viruses and the way they interact with cellular organisms, but should not be the main emphasis in distinguishing viruses. For one thing, virion morphology in different groups may be the result of convergent evolution. That is, there is no evolutionary relatedness involved, nor shared ancestry. The demonstration of chimerism in virus genomes also adds to the unreliable use of morphology when trying to analyze virus evolution and classification since we would be comparing features of different origins (replicase and capsid proteins, for example) in the same subject of study. Importantly also is the fact that not all viruses produce virions, as explained. Virion morphology, however, is still a very useful way to characterize (and even identify) viruses since the expression of their molecular features are identifiable and measurable, and derive directly from the information the virus encodes.",

Taxon names are designated with suffixes: Order (-virales), Family (-viridae), Subfamily (-virinae), Genus (-virus). In most cases the English common names of viruses have become the species names. Generally the virus name provides information regarding the host that the virus was originally isolated from (e.g., Escherichia virus Lambda, Siphoviridae, a virus originally isolated from Escherichia coli, that is regarded as the mother of Molecular Biology), a symptom associated with the disease it incites (Papaya ringspot virus, Potyviridae, first isolated from symptomatic Carica papaya plants showing characteristic ring spots on the fruits), or the disease itself (as mentioned previously, or Yellow fever virus, Flaviviridae, the causal agent of that disease), or the place where it was found for the first time (Lake Sinai virus 1, from the genus Sinaivirus belonging to as of yet an unassigned virus family, and detected in honey bee samples from an apiary near Lake Sinai, South Dakota, United States). Additionally, the rules are in line with the way in which other formal taxon species names are written; they are written in italic script and the first word in the taxon name begins with a capital letter. Viruses can also be referred to by acronyms, sigla (singular: siglum) or abbreviations. An acronym of a virus name is created by using the initial letter in the words of a virus species name: Cucumber mosaic virus (Bromoviridae) is widely referred as CMV. Sigla, on the other hand, are constructed using letters or other characters taken from words of a compound term, like arbovirus for arthropod-borne virus. Most of the times, if not always, sigla are proposed by a group of experts. Abbreviations, finally, can be constructed by a combination of the aforementioned criteria: PiRV-(from 1 to 4) refers to RNA viruses hosted by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans (Chromista): the unrelated PiRV-2 and PiRV-3, and the still unclassified PiRV-4, and PiRV-1 of the family Narnaviridae.

            "text": "Virus taxonomy can then be defined as the arrangement of viruses into related clusters, identification of the extent of relatedness within and among these clusters, and the assignment of names to the clusters (taxa). In other words the goal of taxonomy is to categorize the multitude of known viruses so as to maximize organization, stability, and predictivity. The first goal, probably the most basic, is easily attainable given that the rules of classification are clear and followed by all. That is, the vast diversity of viruses is organized by grouping all similar viruses that share the same denomination and, for the most part, established evolutionary relationships. If this preliminary classification is based on solid grounds, stability ensues. Nonetheless, taxonomy cannot be a static, never-changing tool for virologists. As our realization of viral diversity widens and new technologies become available, virus taxonomy has to be flexible enough to accommodate occasional revisions and reinterpretation of perceived relationships between viruses. As for predictability, this is more complex and challenging; i.e., being able to speculate on the characteristics of near relatives of known species. Whether this is even possible at this point is questionable, given that the current knowledge of virus biodiversity is both biased and fragmentary, reflecting a focus on culturable or disease causing agents. However, the traditional approach to virus classification has been challenged by recent technological developments. Rapid advances in metagenomics have revealed a virosphere that is more phylogenetically and genomically diverse than that depicted in the current classification scheme. Indeed a number of studies have generated large sequence datasets of viral metagenomic sequences that cannot readily be classified using conventional criteria since these are based on phenotypic properties as well as genetic relationships. Classification based on sequence comparisons alone represents a pragmatic solution to the problem of classifying viral metagenomic sequences, but is a significant departure from current methods for classifying viruses. Viral metagenomic sequences may have sufficient defining characteristics to enable their classification as additional taxa in existing virus families and may even be used to justify the creation of new virus families. Further information on diversity and clustering may, however, be required to justify the formation of genera and species ranks within the family. Perhaps though, a reevaluation of the concept of viral species, genera, families, and higher levels of classification is needed; particularly a consensus on which diagnostic properties are the most useful for identifying individual members of a virus species. Just as microbiologists discarded dubious morphological traits in favor of more accurate molecular yardsticks of evolutionary change, virologists can gain new insight into viral evolution through the rigorous analyzes afforded by the molecular phylogenetics of viral genes, which are essential for the classification of viruses below the family taxon level. On the other hand, others have gone as far as suggesting a new division of biological entities into two classes of organisms: ribosome-encoding organisms that include all archaea, bacteria and eukarya, and capsid-encoding organisms, the viruses. Doubts have been raised on the suitability of relying only on the capsid structure for resolving phylogenetic uncertainties. Some argue that a more integrated account of all three categories of containment, replication, and reliance on the information processing systems of the host, recognizes the origin and evolution of viruses. The last point is worth emphasizing; evolutionary processes have shaped the genetic structure and diversity of viruses and the viruses themselves have influenced the evolution of cellular organisms in all domains of life.",

The suffixes used are:Not all virus families have been assigned to a specific order. Similarly, not all families are divided into subfamilies and, in some cases, a virus species does not belong to a defined genus (unassigned) although it does belong to a family. Some genera are also floating (unassigned) since they are not allocated to a specific family. The use of \"Virus name (Order: Family: Subfamily: Genus)\" is not required and it is used here just as an exampleIn 2017 it was approved that the rules concerning the classification of viruses should also be applied to viroids and satellite nucleic acids. Accordingly, suffixes for satellite ranks are: G satellitidae for Families G satellitinae for Subfamilies G satellite for Genera Example 1 (all ranks):Human alphaherpesvirus 1 (Herpesvirales: Herpesviridae: Alphaherpesvirinae: Simplexvirus)Example 2 (unassigned genus in a family):Banana mild mosaic virus (Tymovirales: Betaflexiviridae: Quinvirinae)Example 3 (accepted genus, but unassigned family):Citrus leprosis virus C (Cilevirus)Example 4 (majority of viruses: no order assigned, no subfamilies defined): name is valid if accepted by the ICTV given that (1) it has been published, (2) it is associated with descriptive material, and (3) it conforms to the Rules of the The International Code of Virus Classification and NomenclatureOf course the approval of a name must follow the recommendations and fulfill the requirements established to that effect (i.e., the paperwork related to the application). These are studied by special committees devoted to specific virus groups. Viruses described based on metagenomics studies only, generally lack descriptive material",
