The present study investigated the role of the receptor for CXCL10, CXCR3, in the host response to corneal HSV-1 infection. Mice deficient in CXCR3 (CXCR3\u2212/ \u2212) were found to have an increase in infectious virus in the anterior segment of the eye by day 7 post infection. Coinciding with the increase, selective chemokines including CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 were elevated in the anterior segment of the HSV-1-infected CXCR3\u2212/\u2212 mice. In contrast, there was a time-dependent reduction in the recruitment of NK cells (NK1.1 + CD3 \u2212 ) into the anterior segment of CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. A reduction in NK cells residing in the anterior segment of mice following anti-asialo GM1 antibody treatment resulted in an increase in infectious virus. No other leukocyte populations infiltrating the tissue were modified in the absence of CXCR3. Collectively, the loss of CXCR3 expression specifically reduces NK cell mobilization into the cornea in response to HSV-1.",

In comparing virus titer in the anterior segment of the eye, there was a modest increase in virus recovered in CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice in a time-dependent fashion. The elevation in virus yield in the CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice correlated with an increase in CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 protein levels. Previous studies have reported CpG motifs contained in HSV-1 DNA 16 elicits TLR9 activation 17 which has been found to drive CXCL9 and CXCL10 expression in the cornea following HSV-1 infection. 18 Therefore, it is likely an increase in viral protein antigen expression or increased viral DNA in the anterior segment of CXCR3 \u2212/ \u2212 mice drives the expression of chemokines. However, not all chemokines evaluated were modified (i.e., CXCL1) and none of the cytokines examined were significantly different comparing WT to CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. We have previously reported cytokine/chemokine expression in the cornea is not associated entirely with the level of HSV-1 present suggesting other mechanisms also influence chemokine expression. 19",

The cornea provided a window in which the measurement of leukocyte infiltration could be consistently and reproducibly accomplished. Even though there was a significant increase in CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL9, and CXCL10 levels in the anterior segment of CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice compared to WT mice at day 7 p.i., there was no difference in the infiltration of leukocyte populations including CD4 + T cells into the cornea with the exception of NK cells. We have previously reported an early (day 3 p.i.) but transient deficiency of CD11b + and Gr-1 + cells into the cornea of CCR5 deficient mice following HSV-1 infection. 20 In that study, there were modest but insignificant changes in T cell infiltration into the cornea at day 7 p.i. The present findings also demonstrate the absence of an appreciable effect on CD4 + T cell infiltration into the cornea following HSV-1 infection which is consistent with a low percentage of CD3 + T cells that co-express CXCR3 + following infection. Taken together, it would appear the loss of CXCR3 or CCR5 does not significantly modify T cell infiltration into the eye following HSV-1 infection. Rather, CXCR3 and CCR5 deficiency appears to impact the host response to virus infection in the nervous system ultimately resulting in efficacious or detrimental outcomes depending on the viral pathogen/disease state. 20-25 NK cells have previously been reported to be involved in the development of corneal scarring 26,27 but their control of HSV-1 replication in the eye has been questioned. 28 Specifically, the depletion of NK cells in SCID mice had no bearing on HSV-1 titers found in the cornea whereas adoptive transfer of T but not B cells significantly diminished virus replication. In the present study, NK cells were depleted in the cornea by greater than 90% using antibody to asialo GM1. In another study, we found the anti-asialo GM1 antibody treatment not only depletes NK cells and NKT cells but also depletes CD8 + T effector cells and total CD8 + but not CD4 + T cells infiltrating the HSV-1-infected nervous system (Wuest and Carr, submitted) . Therefore, it is likely the anti-asialo GM1 antibody may have depleted CD8 + T cells in the WT mice. While the majority of T cells infiltrating the cornea are CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells regulate corneal HSV-1 infection even in the absence CD4 + T cells. 27, 29,30 Therefore, it is likely the combined loss of NK cells and CD8 + T cells following treatment with anti-asialo GM1 antibody contributed to the increase in HSV-1 recovered in the cornea in comparison to control antibody-treated animals.",

            "text": "In summary, our results point to a deficiency in the capacity of CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice to respond to ocular HSV-1 infection in a time-dependent manner evident by elevated levels of virus, a decrease in NK cell recruitment, and associated increase in selective chemokines expressed in the anterior chamber. Our hypothesis that CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice would show a reduction in ocular inflammation as a result of the loss of CXCL10 interaction with its receptor proved to be incorrect. However, the data suggest the lack of CXCR3 specifically impacts on NK cell migration to the cornea in response to HSV-1 infection evident by a time-dependent reduction in NK cell migration to the cornea. Ironically, in the absence of CXCR3 ligands including CXCL9 or CXCL10, we previously reported no difference in NK cell recruitment to the cornea in response to HSV-1. 31 However, the absence of CXCR3 has been found to correspond with a reduction in NK cell recruitment to the nervous system of HSV-1 infected mice consistent with CXCR3 function on NK cells (Wuest and Carr, submitted) . Currently, it is unknown why the behavior of NK cells is not consistent between animals deficient in CXCR3 versus those deficient in the CXCR3 ligands. One possibility is the redundancy that may occur between the CXCR3 ligands such that in the absence of one, another CXCR3 ligand can replace/substitute functionally in recruitment of CXCR3-expressing lymphocytes to the site of infection, in this case, the cornea. Alternatively, the only other known CXCR3 ligand, CXCL11, may also play a role. However, we feel this explanation unlikely. Specifically, multiple groups have reported cDNA and genomic sequences indicating C57BL/6 mice have a deletion at the base pair corresponding to +38 position in the mRNA sequence for CXCL11 (Pubmed accession numbers NT_109320, AK040051.1, and AK050012.1). This deletion is predicted to introduce a frame shift at the codon for amino acid (aa) 13 as well as a stop codon that would result in the truncation of the peptide to only 36 of 100 aa. CXCL11 activity would almost certainly be abolished as the N-loop (aa 12-17) required for chemokine receptor binding and essential glycosaminoglycan binding motifs in the C-terminal domain would be absent. 32, 33 Collectively, changing the dynamics of the inflammatory cascade within the anterior segment of the eye thus preserving the visual axis following infection will require intervention at multiple levels simultaneously targeting a number of non-redundant cytokines, chemokines, and other soluble factors that influence the recruitment of leukocytes to the cornea as well as hem-and lymph-angiogenesis. Deciphering the early events following infection continues to be a necessary but arduous task for the eventual development of reagents to replace or complement current anti-inflammatory steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory compounds for use not only in the eye but other critical organs (e.g., brain). CXCR3 deficient mice possess elevated viral titers seven days post infection. C57BL/6 (WT) and CXCR3 deficient (CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212) mice (n=9-18 mice/group) were infected with 500 pfu/ eye HSV-1. At day 0-9 post infection, the mice were euthanized and the anterior segments (cornea and iris) were removed using a dissecting microscope, homogenized, and assayed for infectious virus by plaque assay. The data are expressed as the mean log PFU HSV-1 \u00b1 SEM and are pooled from 3-6 experiments with n=3 mice/group/experiment. *p<.05 for comparison of the WT to CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. C57BL/6 (WT) and CXCR3 deficient (CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212) mice (n=9-13 mice/group/chemokine) were infected with 500 pfu/eye HSV-1. At day 0-7 post infection, the mice were euthanized and the anterior segments were removed using a dissecting microscope, homogenized, and assayed for the indicated chemokine/cytokine by ELISA or suspension array. The data are expressed as the mean pg/mg \u00b1 SEM and are pooled from 3-4 experiments with n=3-4 mice/ group/experiment. *p<.05 for comparison of the WT to CXCR3 \u2212/\u2212 mice. ",
