Within days, Chinese health authorities identified 44 more cases. A novel coronavirus (COVID-19) was subsequently isolated from patients. A putative epidemiological link was made with exposures in a seafood market in Wuhan city. 1 By the end of January 2020, 9720 cases of 2019-nCoV were confirmed throughout China, with further 15,238 suspected cases and 213 deaths. 2 More worryingly, 106 cases were also confirmed abroad in 19 countries, from neighboring countries such as Japan and Vietnam to more distant countries such as Finland, Canada, and Australia. On 30 January 2020, the Emergency Committee of the WHO, under the 2005 International Health Regulations, declared COVID-19 acute respiratory disease a public health emergency of international concern.",

That said, global disease control of COVID-19 is likely to be challenging. Experience from the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and 2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, both also caused by emerging novel coronaviruses, may be informative. Firstly, the rapid spread of COVID-19 is likely to be driven by the phenomenon of 'superspreading'. Superspreading describes heightened transmission of the disease to at least eight contacts and has been observed for several infectious diseases including SARS, MERS, and influenza. 3, 4 Any delay in recognition of the disease and implementation of effective control measures increases the likelihood of greater spread of the pathogen.",

            "text": "Another feature of COVID-19 common to SARS and MERS is the rapidity of global spread due to commercial air travel. The 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic took months to spread from Europe to Australia or South America as ship-borne travel took time. Modern air travel allows passengers to traverse the globe in less than a day. This allows the viruses to rapidly spread across continents, and efforts at airport screening to halt them have been fairly ineffective and costly. 5, 6 This is in addition to the potential for in-flight transmission of the virus among passengers that was observed with SARS. 7 Once the pathogen has landed in a new country, the likelihood of contagion and spread is dependent on local transmission pathways and the strength of local health protection systems. Experience from MERS suggests the transmissibility of the virus is not just due to its inherent infectivity but also due to influence by local contextual variables such as hygiene practices, crowding, and infection control standards. 8 High-income countries such as the United States and United Kingdom have well-developed health protection systems to detect and respond to communicable disease threats. They have the ability to robustly trace contacts, assess suspected cases, and have them tested rapidly to get timely laboratory confirmation of infectious status to guide the management of these individuals. Infected individuals identified can then be isolated until the risk of disease transmission has abated. This containment strategy, however, is resource intensive and may be more difficult to enforce in liberal democracies.",

Health protection investment is analogous to an insurance policy e in good times when it is infrequently called upon it may be deemed unnecessary by policymakers. But this is a dangerous misperception. Furthermore, compared with other public health interventions, health protection interventions are highly cost-effective. 12 Disinvestment in health protection is risky as it is not easy to build up health protection infrastructure, skills, and workforce rapidly. Consequently, the risk of COVID-19 is most likely to be greatest in developing countries that are most likely to lack the means and health protection systems to protect themselves. The burden of infection may, therefore, be heaviest in these countries.",
