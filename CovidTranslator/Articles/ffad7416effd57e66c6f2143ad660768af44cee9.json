The number of cases has been increasing rapidly: by Feb 15, 2020, more than 60 000 cases of COVID19 pneumonia had been reported in China and in other countries worldwide (including Thailand, Japan, South Korea, and the USA), [6] [7] [8] [9] and 1524 patients had died, equivalent to a mortality rate of around 2%.",

CT is important in the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases. In our experience, the imaging features of COVID19 pneumonia are diverse, ranging from normal appearance to diffuse changes in the lungs. In addition, different radiological patterns are observed at different times throughout the disease course. Because the time between onset of symptoms and the development of acute respiratory distress syn drome (ARDS) was as short as 9 days among the initial patients with COVID19 pneumonia, 5 early recognition of the disease is essential for the management of these patients.",

            "text": "Most patients in our cohort showed bilateral lung involvement, with lesions mainly located peripherally and subpleurally with diffuse distribution. The predominant pattern was groundglass opacity, with illdefined margins, air bronchograms, smooth or irregular inter lobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. These imaging characteristics are nonspecific and bear some resemblance to those of SARSCoV [22] [23] [24] and MERSCoV infections. 25, 26 However, unlike SARSCoV infections, some patients in our study presented with pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy, and round cystic changes on CT. Previous studies showed that the presence of pleural effusion in patients infected with MERSCoV or avian influenza H5N1 was a poor prognostic indicator. 25, 27, 28 Similarly, in one patient who died in our study (patient 3), a followup CT scans showed that he had developed bila teral pleural effusion. On the other hand, lymphadenopathy has also been seen in cases of H5N1 infection, 28 which can present as a rapidly progressive pneumonia that results in ARDS. Round cystic changes on CT might be associated with the process of resorption of consolidation; which might be explained by the infection causing damage to the alveolar walls and leading to pneumatoceles. Other findings included intralobular or interlobular septal thickening, and a crazy paving pattern. However, none of the CT features of COVID19 seem to be specific or diagnostic, and COVID19 pneumonia shares CT features with other noninfectious conditions that present as subpleural air space disease. For example, patients with bronchiolitis obliterans with organising pneumonia 29, 30 often show nodules (32%), 29 lymphadenopathy (13%), 30 and pleural effusion (20%). 30 These findings were present, albeit with lower frequency, among our patients with COVID19 pneumonia (nodules 6%, lymphadenopathy 13%, pleural effusion 5%). However, treeinbud signs, masses, cavitations, and calcifications, often suggestive of bacterial or chronic infections, were absent in our study. The typical pattern of CT images in subclinical patients (group 1) was unilateral, multifocal, predominantly groundglass opacities. In the first week after symptom onset (group 2), lesions quickly evolved to bilateral, diffuse disease, with a relative decrease in the frequency of groundglass opacities and a transition to consolidation and mixedpattern development. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were also detected in group 2. Sub sequently, groundglass opacities continued to decrease in frequency throughout the second week after symptom onset (group 3), while consolidation became the second most common pattern. A reticular pattern associated with bronchiolectasis and irregular interlobular or septal thickening were also noted to increase pro gressively from the second week. These findings indicated the appearance of interstitial changes, suggesting the development of fibrosis. However, since the natural history of COVID19 pneumonia is yet to be fully explored, it is too early to label these lung changes as irreversible fibrosis. As the disease progressed in the third week after symptom onset, consolidation and mixed patterns became more common, while groundglass opacities decreased further. Bronchiolectasis, thickening of the adjacent pleura, and pleural effusion mainly appeared at this stage.",

Followup CT showed pro gression or improvement of lung lesions during treatment, sensitively reflecting therapeutic effects, and these changes might be related to outcomes in such patients. The most common pattern of evolution throughout series of CT scans in this study was initial progression to a peak level, followed by radiographic improvement (type 1), and most of these patients were subsequently discharged. In addition, most patients who showed a pattern of radiographic improvement across several scans (type 3) were discharged from hospital. Thus, a type 1 or type 3 disease course might be associated with favourable outcomes. On the other hand, progressive radiographic deterioration despite medical treatment seems to be associated with poor prognosis, with two deaths in our study occurring among the 18 patients with the type 2 pattern.",

Second, we compared imaging patterns between four groups of different time intervals from the onset of symptoms, which does not account for potential individual variations. Third, because of the short time for case collection, followup CT scans were available for only 57 patients, around 40% of whom had only two CT scans. Although we have outlined the main patterns of evolution seen on CT imaging in patients with COVID19 pneumonia, longterm radiological followup is needed to confirm our findings. Finally, as lung biopsy specimens were not available in this study, the relationship between radiological and histopathological findings remains to be investigated. Therefore, other potential causes of ground glass opacity, such as pulmonary oedema and haemorrhage, cannot be estimated.",
