Viruses, pancreatic enzyme deficiency, and an association of the condition with the cat' s molting cycle were all suggested as causes. One correspondent even noted an improvement of his patients by using herbal remedies containing the bark of Berberis vulgaris, the leaves of Rubus idaeus, the root of Rheum, and a small quantity of Foeniculum vulgare! The continuing use of such remedies serves to remind us that knowledge of feline gastrointestinal disease has lagged slightly behind the other rapidly developing areas of feline medicine.",

            "text": "}OHN R. AUGUST of pedigrees from related cats with this disorder suggests that megaesophagus is inherited as a recessive non-sex-linked trait. 14 The feline esophagus is composed of circular and longitudinal layers of smooth muscle in its middle and caudal sections. There is no identifiable muscular thickening of the lower esophagus consistent with a distinct anatomic sphincter. 5 The smooth muscle of the feline esophagus is innervated by postganglionic parasympathetic fibers originating in the intrinsic autonomic plexuses within the smooth muscle. In comparison with the dog, where these plexuses are limited in number in the cranial esophagus, the plexuses of the cat are equally distributed throughout the length of the esophagus . 5 Regulation of plexus activity, and thus coordination of muscular contraction, is supplied through preganglionic fibers carried in the vagus and arising from neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the brainstem. 55 Experimental destruction of the dorsal motor nuclei in cats results in esophageal dysfunction resembling megaesophagus. 14 Following bilateral cervical vagotomy, complete paralysis of the feline esophagus develops with eventual gradual return of peristalsis to the areas composed of smooth muscle. No loss of ganglion cells in the intrinsic plexuses, subsequent to this procedure, has been noticed. 8 The cause of megaesophagus in the cat is not understood. There does not appear to be a congenital deficiency of cells in the dorsal motor nuclei 1 or intrinsic plexuses 12 of cats with megaesophagus. In fact a significant increase in the number of cells was noted in the dorsal motor nuclei of cats with megaesophagus when compared with normal cats. Although the observed changes may have been artifactual because of a delay in perfusion of brain tissue compared with the control group, the cells of the dorsal motor nucleus and the nucleus ambiguus of these cats were smaller and more pyknotic than those of the controls. 13 Reports of histologic examination of esophageal tissues from cats with megaesophagus are conflicting. No evidence of neuronal degeneration or primary neurogenic atrophy of cells in the intrinsic plexuses has been noted. 2 However, a lack of definition of the nuclei and nucleoli of ganglion cells was observed in affected cats in another study. Occasional degenerative changes in the esophageal muscle with some monocytic infiltrate were also present. 12 Two Siamese cats that had been vomiting since weaning were found to have megaesophagus with accompanying areas of heterotopic gastric mucosa in the esophagus. 2 It is speculated that the changes may have occurred as an incidental developmental abnormality or as a result of a metaplastic healing process secondary to an esophagitis _caused by reflux of gastric contents into the flaccid esophagus. 2",

Pooling of gastric contents in the esophagus during anesthesia with a concurrent loss of the swallowing reflex and secondary esophageal peristalsis was considered to be the cause. Within a few days of the surgical procedure, affected cats lost weight rapidly, became clinically dehydrated, and regurgitated food though remaining hungry. 47 In persons, esophagitis is considered to be a result of dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter with a subsequent failure of the antireflux barrier at the gastroesophageal junction. 18 The effectiveness of this barrier becomes further compromised during esophagitis as esophageal inflammation severely disrupts orderly esophageal motor activity and further decreases lower esophageal sphincter pressure. 29 Esophagitis in humans, and presumably in cats and dogs, may therefore become a selfperpetuating disorder that requires prompt recognition and therapy. Interestingly, under experimental conditions using dogs, neither acid nor bile alone produced significant esophagitis. When 1 per cent taurocholate was added to acid and instilled into the esophagus, severe inflammation was produced. 29",

In a recent series of 30 cats. with this tumor, 9 cats (30 per cent) were presented because of recurrent regurgitation (in comparison with 43 per cent with the primary problem of dyspnea). 20 Anterior mediastinal lymphosarcoma is a disease of the young adult cat (peak incidence, 1 to 2 years), and oriental breeds are predisposed. 2\u00b0 Feline leukemia virus was detected in 77 per cent of cats with this tumor in one study. 24 Cats with anterior mediastinal lymphosarcoma are frequently presented with an acute onset of severe dyspnea. Tachypnea, intolerance to handling, and orthopnea are often noticed on the examination table. Lung sounds are usually muffled or absent, and the anterior thorax is frequently incompressible. Occasionally a mass may be noted at the thoracic inlet. Dilatation of the cervical esophagus and obstruction to passage of contrast material at the thoracic inlet have been noted. 20 The site of primary neoplastic proliferation is the thymus. The neoplastic lymphoid cells induce rosette formation with guinea-pig eryth-rocytes31 and metastasize to the paracortical or thymus-dependent areas of local lymph nodes, thus confirming their origin as T-cells. 39 Direct extension of the tumor into the lungs and pericardium usually occurs, and microscopic infiltration of the splenic white pulp is common. 39",

Positive cultures were obtained from 45 per cent of clinically normal cats in an English humane society. 7 In a survey of animals less than three months old from kennels in the Denver area, 34.9 per cent of puppies and 6 per cent of kittens yielded positive stool cultures. 3 In contrast, fecal cultures from 92 diarrheic and 10 normal cats produced only two isolates. 21 When pet cats have been incriminated with zoonotic spread of Campylobacter, family members have usually become ill several days after acquiring a kitten suffering from acute diarrhea. 51 \u2022 52 The risk of being infected with this organism by a normal cat or dog appears negligible, and the risk of spread can be minimized by frequent hand-washing and prevention of close contact between children and diarrheic kittens. 5 1 Humans appear to be more susceptible to a given dose of Campylobacter than are kittens or puppies. 50 Clarification of the role of Campylobacter as a pathogen in the young cat will ultimately depend on the isolation (on selective media) of this bacteria from diarrheic feces in the absence of other bacterial, dietary, toxic, or viral causes of diarrhea, and observation of a specific response to antimicrobial therapy.",

A moderate to marked eosinophilia accompanies the condition. At necropsy, examination of small intestine shows eosinophilic infiltration into the mucosa and submucosa, fibrosis of the lamina propria, and hypertrophy of muscle layers. Some cats have multivisceral infiltration involving liver, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, or bone marrow.

Quantitative fecal fat analysis is one method for confirming the presence of maldigestive or malabsorptive disease. It has recently been determined that more than 98 per cent of normal cats excrete less than 3 gm of fecal fat per 24-hour period.

Cats with ileal tumors often are presented with a history of chronic diarrhea and depression with a late onset of vomiting occurring 16 to 24 hours after the last meal. 28 The tumor often appears as a fusiform thickening of the intestinal wall. Because of a lack of supporting structure in the area of the tumor, the intestinal wall may eventually dilate and even rupture at the tumor site. 28 Microscopic infiltration of main mesenteric lymph nodes is invariable. 39 The selective early infiltration of the germinal centers of mesenteric lymph nodes 39 and the presence of surface immunoglobulins and complement receptors on the neoplastic lymphocytes 31 confirm that the tumor is of Bcell origin. Malignant cells are frequently found in the splenic white pulp and renal cortices and, to a lesser extent, in the liver and bone marrow. 39 ",

Excessive histamine release is thought to damage the vascular network of the intestinal submucosa, resulting in ischemic necrosis and ulcerative gastroduodenitis. The mucosal ulceration is exacerbated by increased secretion of hydrochloric acid by parietal cells stimulated by histamine. 35 The vomiting associated with mastocytosis is thought to be due to irritation from ulcerative gastroduodenitis, gastric hypermotility induced by elevated histamine levels, and splenomegaly causing pressure on adjacent viscera.",
