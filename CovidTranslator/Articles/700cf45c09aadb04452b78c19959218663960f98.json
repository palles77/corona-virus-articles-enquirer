We sought to build an accessible interactive model that could facilitate hospital capacity planning in the presence of significant uncertainty about the proportion of the population that is COVID-19+ and the rate at which COVID-19 is spreading in the population. Our approach was to design a tool with parameters that hospital leaders could adjust to reflect their local data and easily modify to conduct sensitivity analyses.",

We deployed this model as an interactive online tool. 6 Inputs to the model include estimates of the characteristics of the patient population and hospital capacity. The patient population inputs are the starting population of COVID-19-patients, COVID-19+ patients, and the estimated doubling time for total COVID-19 admissions (i.e. how many days it will take for the number of total admissions at the institution to double). For the patient cohorts, we estimated what percentage of the COVID-19+ patient population would follow 5 potential trajectories through the hospital, assuming various combinations of patient flow between IC and AC. Until more reliable data are available, estimates for input values are generated through review of existing data and discussion with experts. 7, 8 The model will be updated as data become available.",
