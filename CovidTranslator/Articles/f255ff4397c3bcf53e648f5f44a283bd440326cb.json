Previous publications, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals, have addressed infection control practices in hospitals. 1, 2 However, the shift of health care delivery from hospitals to other settings has broadened the types and numbers of health care personnel who require training in appropriate infection control practices. Increasingly, infection control training is needed for a broader array of personnel, including nonclinical personnel, such as public health professionals, who may be involved in response efforts to large-scale infectious disease events/outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pandemic influenza.",

Supplementing guidelines with tailored educational tools may be one way to improve knowledge and the application of recommended practices. 6 To guide the development of infection control educational tools and curricula, we conducted an assessment to determine current infection control knowledge, identify potential gaps between knowledge and practice, and identify perceived training needs among a varied group of health care personnel including clinicians, public health professionals, and allied health personnel. By developing tailored courses that address gaps between knowledge and practices, educational efforts may be able to improve the adoption of guidelines by health care personnel and, ultimately, patient outcomes.",

Because unfamiliarity with guidelines is a known barrier to compliance, course topics in isolation guideline recommendations may be a first step in improving guideline compliance. 5 Not unexpectedly, physicians were less likely than RNs to have infection control training and were more likely to answer incorrectly on certain questions. In designing infection control courses, it may be necessary to tailor content to meet the specific needs of physicians untrained in infection control, as well as the needs of health care personnel with previous training. By tailoring courses to the audience's needs, job duties, and educational level, courses can improve the likelihood of successful integration of new recommendations into clinical practice. 7 Future research should focus on further exploring the specific needs of different disciplines and possible reasons for lack of infection control training for physicians, such as gaps in medical education and the challenges of providing training to personnel who are not based at specific facilities.",
