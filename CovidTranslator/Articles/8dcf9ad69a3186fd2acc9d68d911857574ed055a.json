Aim: To study the infection control practice in isolation facilities participating in the European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases (EuroNHID) project. Methods: A survey was conducted during 2009 of 48 isolation facilities caring for patients with HIDs in 16 European countries. Checklists and standard evaluation forms were used to collect and interpret data on hand hygiene, routine hygiene and disinfection, and waste management. Findings: Forty percent of HIDs had no non-hand-operated sinks or alcohol-based antiseptic distributors, while 27% did not have procedures for routine hygiene, final disinfection, or safe discarding of non-disposable objects or equipment. There was considerable variation in the management of waste and in the training of housekeeping personnel. EuroNHID has developed recommendations for hand hygiene, disinfection, routine hygiene, and waste management. Conclusions: Most aspects of hand hygiene, routine hygiene and disinfection, and waste management were considered at least partially adequate in the majority of European isolation facilities dedicated for the care of patients with HIDs. But considerable variability was observed, with management of waste and training of housekeeping personnel being generally less satisfactory.",

            "text": "Healthcare facilities represent a particular challenge for infection control, since susceptible patients and healthcare workers (HCWs) may be exposed to patients with unsuspected infectious diseases. During the past decade efforts have been made to develop infection control capacity within healthcare facilities and promote safety for both patients and HCWs. However, healthcare facilities play a critical role for the spread of several emerging or re-emerging highly infectious diseases (HIDs), including viral haemorrhagic fevers, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), influenza A H1N1, and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. 1e7 The European Network for Infectious Diseases defines HID as infectious disease easily transmitted from person to person, causing life-threatening disease, presenting a serious hazard in healthcare settings and in the community, and requiring specific control measures. 8 Many HIDs spread rapidly within closed settings if they are not suspected promptly or infection control measures are poorly implemented. 9 The European Network for Highly Infectious Diseases (EuroNHID) is a European Union-funded project (July 2007 to December 2010), whose aim is to support isolation facilities and provide appropriate infection control advice for isolation centres responsible for managing cases of emerging, reemerging or deliberately released HID agents. EuroNHID is coordinated by the National Institute for Infectious Diseases 'Lazzaro Spallanzani' (Rome, Italy). During 2009 field surveys were conducted in 48 isolation facilities in 16 European countries to assess resources and capabilities for the safe and effective management of HID patients, including infrastructure, human resources, equipment, and infection control procedures. Data are now presented from these surveys on hand hygiene, routine hygiene and disinfection, management of waste, and recommended optimum and minimum requirements for these issues.",

Most participants were clinicians working in high level isolation units or other isolation facilities designated for referral of patients with HIDs, having backgrounds in infectious diseases, intensive care, infection control, pulmonary medicine, occupational health, or public health. In order to survey only isolation facilities identified by national health authorities for the referral and management of HIDs, we asked partners to provide official documents in which these hospitals are designated as such. This process led to the identification of 48 facilities (Figure 1 ), which represent the centres identified in all participating countries except Spain, where only Catalonian centres were identified.",

The materials used in the construction of the isolation room (walls, furniture) should be easily cleaned and disinfected, resist frequent and intensive disinfection, be non-porous, and repel dust. Decontamination should be one of the principal factors for selection of equipment and medical devices in these facilities. Disposable items/devices or items/devices that can be safely decontaminated should be preferred. Non-disposable medical equipment (e.g. bronchoscope) should be dedicated to the care of HID patients only and during their entire hospitalization. Where this is not feasible, medical equipment may be used for other patients, only after high-level disinfection using a disinfectant with wide-spectrum antibacterial and antiviral action has been accomplished, and only after the nature of the HID is taken under consideration. Spillages of blood and other biological material should be immediately removed and decontaminated. All surfaces and equipment within the patient's isolation room should be cleaned and decontaminated twice per day (routine hygiene). Final decontamination should be applied after discharge of a patient with HID. Final decontamination should cover all objects/devices/equipment/furniture of the isolation room, including filtration system. Cleaning and decontamination of horizontal and vertical surfaces and furniture of the isolation room should be accomplished with appropriate hospital detergents. Where hypochlorite solution (1000 ppm) is used, the working dilution should be prepared on site at the time of use. In order to eliminate the possibility of nosocomial spread of HID agents, dry mopping and household vacuuming should be forbidden within isolation facilities; wet vacuuming should be preferred. The disinfection procedure of items/equipment should be performed in the anteroom of the isolation room. For decontamination of large and complex equipment, a pre-identified, dedicated area within the isolation facility should be available. For mechanical devices that cannot be immersed within a disinfectant, appropriate procedures of disinfection of environmental surfaces should be implemented. In case this is not feasible, it is advisable to use an autoclave. Large and complex equipment may require decontamination on site before disassembly, and a fumigation procedure may be applied. Fumigation (preferably using 5% H 2 O 2 ) may be applied following terminal decontamination. Integral autoclave facilities or safe access to pre-identified, dedicated autoclave facilities should be in place. Housekeeping personnel and other HCWs involved in routine hygiene and final decontamination in isolation facilities should be trained appropriately and on a regular basis, including the use of personal protective equipment. Monitoring and audit in order to investigate compliance of HCWs with written procedures should be conducted periodically.",

Another serious safety issue was identified, in that less than half of the surveyed facilities had established training of housekeeping personnel in procedures for infection control and personal protective equipment. This is vitally important, since the risk for acquisition of a HID is real during housekeeping procedures. 20 Housekeeping personnel are often not permanent and their basic training may not include the management of HIDs.",

The management of liquid waste was generally more satisfactory, although several facilities lacked decontamination procedures for liquid waste, with possible environmental consequences.

Most of the data were therefore collected before the 2009 influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. The experience gained during the pandemic may have caused modifications and improvements of procedures and capacities that are not reflected in our data. Furthermore, the study's focus on isolation facilities facing HIDs limits its applicability to this setting. Facilities facing HIDs may put more emphasis on isolation and infection control issues than ordinary hospitals but the latter may also have to manage HIDs. Data were also collected on the availability of procedures, but no assessment was made of how appropriate these procedures were nor the level of compliance. The recommendations for adequate management also have limitations. Because of the infrequency of suspected and confirmed HIDs, no high-quality studies exist. Consequently, the recommendations are not evidence-based and no ranking of recommendations is possible. The inadequacy of infection control procedures was particularly evident during the 2003 SARS pandemic and the 2009 influenza H1N1 pandemic, when hospitals played a central role in the dissemination of both infections. 3e6 Our recommendations are therefore based on experience reported in the literature or revealed during this study, and on the partners' expert opinion. Consensus recommendations for biocontainment patient care units specifically designed to care for patients with serious communicable diseases have also been issued in the USA. 21 Generally, written procedures and protocols facilitate the management of HID cases and ensure safety during medical practice.
