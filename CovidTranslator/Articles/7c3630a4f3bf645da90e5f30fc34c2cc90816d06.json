Methods: MERS-CoV infected patients who were managed in a tertiary care center during the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak were reviewed. To analyze predictive factors for pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure, we evaluated clinical variables measured within three days from symptom onset. Results: A total of 45 patients were included in the study: 13 patients (28.9%) did not develop pneumonia, 19 developed pneumonia without respiratory failure (42.2%), and 13 progressed to respiratory failures (28.9%).

For respiratory failure, the indicators included male, hypertension, low albumin concentration, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, and CRP ! 4 mg/dL (all P < 0.05). With ! two predictive factors for pneumonia development, 100% of patients developed pneumonia. Patients lacking the predictive factors did not progress to respiratory failure.

Although several studies analyzed prognostic factors for fatal outcome, 11e16 predictive factors for pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure have not been reported. To identify factors which can predict pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure at the early course of the disease, we evaluated MERS-CoV infected patients managed in a tertiary care center during the 2015 MERS outbreak in Korea.",

As it is still unclear whether initially asymptomatic patients would develop pneumonia or not, 17 we included all the MERS-CoV infected patients managed at our hospital during the outbreak regardless of symptoms presence. To avoid confusion with the case definition of MERS which did not included asymptomatic cases, 18 we used the term of 'MERS-CoV infected patient' rather than 'MERS patients' throughout the present paper. MERS-CoV infections were confirmed on the basis of rRT-PCR assays targeting upstream of the E gene and the open-reading frame gene 1a. 18, 19 Disease status of included patients was assessed at six weeks from their symptom onset and patients were divided into three groups depending on pneumonia development and progression to respiratory failure: patients without the development of pneumonia (group 1), patients who developed pneumonia without respiratory failure (group 2), and pneumonia patients who progressed to respiratory failure (group 3). For practical purposes, respiratory failure was defined as the need for mechanical ventilation (MV). The institutional review board of our hospital approved the present study.",

These findings correlate with previous data suggesting that old age is associated with poor prognosis. 11,13e15,34,35 Similarly, the proportion of males increased according to disease severity, though male sex was only significant for predicting respiratory failure. Although the mean age of males was older than that of females (49.7 and 42.6 years, respectively), it was not statistically significant (P Z 0.169). Previous data also reported that overall proportion of male was higher and was associated with severe infection. 15, 34 It could be meaningful observation that the same finding was observed in the Republic of Korea where the social activity of females is not restricted, especially among healthcare workers. On the other hand, hypoalbuminemia and hypertension were predictive factors only for respiratory failure, while high viral load was predictive factor for the development of pneumonia. These factors were related with severe disease and poor prognosis of MERS in previous reports. 1, 12, 13, 15, 16, 34, 35 Our study has several strengths and limitations. Due to its retrospective nature, there may be a bias regarding collecting medical information in retrospective manner. However, as all electronic medical records were standardized to record symptoms and signs in the same way from the beginning of the outbreak, bias was minimized. Secondly, there were missing values when calculating the sensitivity and specificity of predictive factors, which is another limitation of retrospective study. Lastly, the present study did not perform multivariate analysis due to limited sample size and need to be validated. Prospective studies with sufficient number of patients are required for validation of the predictive factors identified in the present study. Despite these limitations, our data would be suitable for identifying predictive factors because we could observe entire course of the disease from exposure and apply homogenous management to patients.",
