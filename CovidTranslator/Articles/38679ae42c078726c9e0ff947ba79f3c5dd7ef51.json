This erectile disorder is uncommon in domestic animals and results from the engorgement of the corpus cavernosum while the corpus spongiosum is less turgid than in a normal erection (Rochat 2001). Erectile tissue engorgement can either be the consequence of an increase in arterial blood flow or of a reduction in venous drainage (Bivalacqua and Burnett 2006) . The aetiologies of this condition are various. Arterial overflow of the penis occurs when a traumatic event produces an arterialecavernosal shunt; in man, venous outflow occlusion can follow haematological disorders, prostatic diseases, spinal cord trauma, use of pharmacological agents such as heparin and phenothiazines, or it can be idiopathic (Rochat 2001). In the veterinary literature other reported causes of priapism are spinal cord lesions associated with distemper, complications of castration and lower urinary tract diseases (Rochat 2001) .",

The causative agent is a mutant FCoV generated by a mutation of the widespread enteric strain that gains the ability to replicate in macrophages and spreads through infected monocytes (Paltrinieri et al 2001) .

Effusive FIP develops in the absence of cell-mediated immunity, when antigeneantibody complex deposition and the release of vasoactive amines following complement fixation lead to vasculitis and plasma protein exudation (Andrew 2000) .",
