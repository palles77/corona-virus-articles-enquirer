Regulation of these proteins allows the cell to alter its behavior under different circumstances. A major mechanism of protein regulation is utilizing protein kinases and phosphatases; enzymes that catalyze the transfer of phosphates between substrates [1]. Proteins involved in phosphate signaling are well studied and include kinases and phosphatases that catalyze opposing reactions regulating both structure and function of the cell. Kinomics is the study of kinases, phosphatases and their targets, and has been used to study the functional changes in numerous diseases and infectious diseases with aims to delineate the cellular functions affected. Identifying the phosphate signaling pathways changed by certain diseases or infections can lead to novel therapeutic targets. However, a daunting 518 putative protein kinase genes have been identified [2], indicating that this protein family is very large and complex. Identifying which enzymes are specific to a particular disease can be a laborious task. In this review, we will provide information on large-scale systems biology methodologies that allow global screening of the kinome to more efficiently identify which kinase pathways are pertinent for further study.",

Small simple viruses may contain fewer than a dozen genes on a genome consisting of a few kilo-bases that encode up to a dozen proteins. Significantly more complex eukaryotic organisms possess genomes in the mega-base range that, with alternative splicing and various possible post-translational modifications, may encode upwards of millions of protein permutations. For many decades, much research effort went into either understanding the simpler organisms, or trying to delineate a few molecules within more complex systems. With advances in whole genome sequencing, bioinformatics and instrumentation, it has been possible for more than a decade to assess, both quantitatively and simultaneously, changes in the levels of total mRNA expression and in levels of thousands of proteins. Despite these advances, cellular regulation is more often determined by protein post translation modifications than by absolute quantity. This review will focus on one of the largest and best-studied subsets of proteins, which are proteins involved in kinase signaling. This field of \"kinomics\" encompasses kinases, kinase targets and antagonistic phosphatases [1] .",

The first such technologies -microarrays and quantitative proteomics -were revolutionary in their ability to simultaneously measure thousands of genes and proteins within a single experiment. This ability to globally assess the state of a cell or tissue has since expanded and evolved into numerous other techniques that have been adapted to allow more high-throughput analyses. In an effort to probe even deeper into the cellular proteome, tools have been developed to detect and isolate specific subsets of proteins that might not otherwise be detected. Examples of these protein subsets include those with post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation, ubiquitination, lipidation) and localizations in response to different stimuli. Similarly, different classes of enzymes (e.g. kinases, proteases, hydrolases) can be probed for their activity levels in response to various conditions.",

Given its central role in cellular function, aberrant regulation of kinase signaling can profoundly affect homeostasis and has been found to be involved in many disease states including insulin resistance [3, 4] , autoimmunity [5, 6] , viral infection [7, 8] , and oncogenesis [9, 10] . Hence, assessing the kinome can provide insight into complex pathological processes across a wide array of diseases and has also been a well-studied target for therapeutics. It is therefore not surprisingly that many approved pharmaceuticals target kinases in an effort to restore homeostatic cell signaling events, and that efforts have been made to explore repurposing these drugs for other diseases [11e14] . Notably, kinase signaling may also be exploited clinically as a diagnostic tool and will be discussed below.",

Nucleic acid-based approaches 2.1.1. siRNA siRNAs, or small interfering RNAs, are regulators of expression and function of genes [15] . Double stranded precursors are cleaved by dicer proteins into short fragments. The siRNA consists of a guide strand that is assembled into a RISC-loading complex which binds to dsRNA, cutting it into a single stranded functional siRNA. This RISC complex will recognize a complementary mRNA strand and cleaves this strand at a single site, releasing the fragments, which are ready to cleave more mRNA. The resulting decrease in mRNA in the cell leads to a decrease in expression of the gene. By using this endogenous host mechanism, siRNA fragments can be transfected into the cell for targeted gene knockdown.",

Some panels are specific for particular cellular functional pathways, such as Qiagen's SureSilencing \u00ae siRNA arrays (http://www.sabiosciences.com/pathwaymagazine/ pathways9/suresilencing-sirna-arrays.php), which are predesigned to target main cellular genes in a biological or functional pathway. By using siRNA panels specific to targeting kinases or phosphorylases, expression patterns or cell pathways affected by these enzymes can be determined. For example, Azorsa et al. used this method to determine kinases involved in tau protein hyperphosphorylation, which is known to occur during Alzheimer's disease [16] . In this study, siRNA transfection was used for 572 kinases, then increases or decreases in tau phosphorylation levels in a neuroglioma cell line were observed. Alternatively, using kinase or phosphorylase siRNA screens in cell lines to determine cell viability can also be performed. Hu and colleagues used a genome-wide siRNA library screen of 206 phosphatases and 691 kinases to observe those detrimental to the viability of a Rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, which is the most common type of sarcoma in children [17] . Using siRNA screening of a panel of inhibitors that target kinases, Kim et al. were able to identify a host factor kinase that is involved in hepatitis C virus entry [18] . Jansen and colleagues used a kinome-wide siRNA screen to identify kinases that have a role in acquired resistance to CDK4/6 small-molecule inhibitors which are associated with breast cancer [19] . This study was able to determine which kinase was a key modifier of sensitivity to the inhibitor, and was also able to restore sensitivity by targeting this factor. This example clearly shows how powerful this tool can be to narrow the focus from a large number of possible targets to one or two key kinases. In a contrasting direction of focus, another study by Giroux et al. was able to probe the kinome with an siRNA panel to try and induce apoptosis in a pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, directly identifying therapeutic targets [20] .",

Amplification of DNA fragments into billions of copies allows detection and identification of gene sequences in a sample using specific primers that are short DNA fragments with defined sequences complementary to the target DNA sequence. Quantitative measurements of gene expression can be obtained using a modified technique called real-time PCR, and is used to determine how much DNA is present in a sample while it is being synthesized. Two methods are commonly used; either fluorescent dyes that nonspecifically integrate into double stranded DNA, or sequence specific fluorescent DNA probes. In these experiments, specialized thermal cyclers equipped with fluorescence detection modules are used. The fluorescence signals are measured as amplification occurs and the signals are proportional to the total amount of target DNA, allowing the determination of the initial number of copies of template DNA with accuracy and high sensitivity. Gene expression measurements can be determined by coupling qPCR with reverse transcription (RT-qPCR), where RNA is reverse transcribed into cDNA, then the cDNA is used as the template for qPCR. This can be used to target specific phosphatases or kinases of interest. For example, Fu and colleagues targeted inositol polyphosphatase-like 1 by qPCR and showed a significantly higher level of this phosphatase in hepatocellular carcinoma tissue in comparison to noncancerous tissues [22] .",

The two most common detection methods are by the incorporation of fluorescently-labeled nucleotides during synthesis, or the incorporation of biotin-labeled nucleotides which are subsequently stained with fluorescentlylabeled streptavidin. mRNA molecules are taken from a sample and a reference, the samples are converted into complementary DNA, then are labeled with separate fluorescent probes. After mixing, they are added to the chip for hybridization and scanned to measure the relative expression of the two colored samples. Expression of the kinome can be observed with this method by using probe sequences of kinases and phosphatases.

A second very useful aspect of peptide arrays is that they can be adapted for any particular species for which the genome sequence is known [29e31]. This is particularly useful for species which do not have many, or any, other tools available, such as microarrays, specific phospho-antibodies or commercial kits that measure kinase activity. For example, the use of this technology in agricultural species has been immensely valuable (reviewed by Daigle 2014 [28] ) and has been applied to studies with cows [32] and poultry [33] . Protein arrays have been equally successful in smaller models for which reagents are difficult to find, such as hamsters [34] , guinea pigs [35] and yeast [36] . The main disadvantage of this method is the upfront cost of the detection scanner and a substantial amount of needed expertise in setting up custom arrays; thus, these are typically provided by a core facility.",

Phospho-ELISAs can be found both for specific kinases, such as ERK1/2 or EGFR, as well as for broader kinase classes such as phospho-tyrosine [37] or phospho-serine/ threonine activity. A common use of this technique is to determine or confirm whether specific kinase signaling pathways are activated under different conditions.

Flow cytometry Flow cytometry can be easily used to evaluate phosphorylation events where fresh or fixed cells are incubated with phosphospecific antibodies and then conjugated to a fluorescent tag for detection. This method has the distinct advantage of providing detailed and quantitative information about single cells in addition to the entire population of cells. For example, one can calculate the number of cells that become phosphorylated, as well as measure the relative amount of phosphorylation per cell. Newer flow cytometers can also analyze samples in a 96-well plate format and run in an automated fashion [39] (For example: BDSciences http:// www.vp-scientific.com/bd_biosciences_protocol.htm). A second advantage of flow cytometry is the ability to multiplex multiple antibodies. For example, an increasing number of kits and protocols have optimized conditions that allow for 8-to 27-plex assays (see Krutzik et al. [40] for one such protocol). Multiple samples may also be barcoded and combined into a single tube for high-throughput analysis [41] . One popular application of flow cytometry is to monitor changes in immune cell populations and activation states in response to cancer treatments [42] . Increasingly, single cell flow cytometry is also a useful tool for analyzing a multitude of cell signaling pathways in one experiment, for example by examining patterns of B-cell activation [43] .",

In a later study, the same research group used a combination of six different methods to analyze the phosphoproteome of Arabidopsis. They used a combination of TiO 2 , ZrO 2 and iron-immobilized metal affinity chromatography (Fe-IMAC) coupled to ammonia or phosphate buffers for phosphopeptide elution. In total, they identified 2171 phosphorylation sites on 1346 proteins, including 94 phosphorylated tyrosine residues.",

One method to prevent non-specific binding with IMAC is to chemically modify acidic residues via methyl esterification.

They reported detection of 5 fmol of phosphoprotein within a standard mixture of proteins. They mention that another advantage of using methylesterification is that heavy and light labels can be used in the labelling reagent to perform phosphosite quantification. The disadvantage to using methylesterification is increased variation during the sample labelling steps. It is also possible to prevent non-specific binding by changing buffer conditions. Tsai et al. [62] tested a number of different acids and varied pH using a Fe-NTA resin to find optimal binding conditions for phosphopeptides. They found that a solution of 6% acetic acid adjusted to pH 3.5 with NaOH provided optimal conditions for phosphopeptide binding. In a single step procedure, they identified 386 phosphoproteins from 550 mg of non-small-cell lung cancer cell lysate with 96% specificity.",

Han et al. compared the efficiency of Fe3\u00fe-IMAC to SAX chromatography to identify phosphorylation sites in human liver tissue [63] .

            "text": "When establishing kinase networks, it is important to identify both the kinase and the kinase target. Bottom-up proteomics cannot only identify the site of phosphorylation but can also identify potential kinases responsible for the phosphorylation event. Due to the large dynamic range of the proteome, it is usually necessary to separate kinases from protein mixtures prior to LC-MS/MS analysis in order to identify an acceptable number of kinases. The ActivX system is a commercially available system that utilizes active site probes that react specifically with the ATPbinding site of kinases and other ATP-binding enzymes [65] . The probe consists of an ATP moiety attached to a desthiobiotin molecule through an acyl linker. Upon binding to the ATP-binding site, the acyl group reacts with a conserved lysine residue in most ATPbinding sites leaving behind the desthiobiotin tag. Kinases and other ATPases are enriched through binding to avidin or streptavidin agarose and then eluted for LC-MS/MS analysis. Kinases can be isolated in their intact state after reaction with the ATPase probe and subsequently trypsin-digested on-bead, or desthiobiotinmodified peptides can be collected after trypsin digestion [66] . The former method will identify multiple peptides per kinase and provides stronger evidence for identification while the latter can be used to quantify the extent of active site labelling, thus quantifying that particular kinase. Ideally, both approaches should be used for a more comprehensive identification and quantification of kinases in the system of interest. The main disadvantage of this technique is that, although there is still significant enrichment of kinases, the probe will also bind non-kinases that have ATP-or nucleotidebinding capabilities.",

However, its most interesting application is the potential to identify inhibitors for aberrant kinases in a disease state. Phosphorylation signaling is involved in cell division and growth, among many other processes. The focus on kinases as potential drug targets led to the development of the kinase inhibitor Gleevec \u00ae as a treatment for chronic myelogenous leukemia, now used in clinical practice. Most kinase assays to measure activity and find potential inhibitors are performed with the purified kinase. The issue with this approach is that kinases exist in a state of constant interaction with other proteins in the cellular network that may modify their activity. This is at least part of the reason for poor translation of many kinase inhibitors from in vitro assays into being used as treatment for disease. Patricelli et al. [67] used the ActivX system to profile kinases and identify potential kinase inhibitors in HL60 and PC3 cancer cell lines. Using a combination of ADP-and ATP-binding site probes, they identified approximately 220 kinases in both cell types. To quantify these proteins, they specifically targeted the active site peptides of approximately 100 of these kinases. They measured the effect of several different inhibitors on the signal intensity of these peptides to find IC 50 values and binding affinities. In most cases, the affinity of kinase inhibitors discovered through the ActivX system closely matched the affinities found using the recombinant, purified enzymes. However, they did find several cases where the affinity of inhibitors measured by the ActivX system differed from the in vitro assays. They conclude that, although the reasons for these differences are unknown, it shows the potential of this system to identify kinase inhibitors that may behave differently in cell-based systems compared to their activities in the purified state [67] .",

The reaction is generally caused by the oxidation of luciferin with oxygen, catalyzed by luciferase, resulting in an oxyluciferin molecule that is in an excited state. The oxyluciferin molecule emits visible light, then returns to its original state. There are over 30 different bioluminescence systems, 9 of which have their chemical structures determined. The most welldefined is the D-luciferin bioluminescence system. The first step in this chemical reaction is the reversible conversion of D-luciferin to luciferyl adenylate using ATP. It is because of this reaction that this luciferase has been used to design a high throughput kinase activity detection method. In these assays, the luminescence signal is inversely proportional to the amount of kinase activity; the assays quantify the amount of ATP that remains in a sample after a kinase reaction. In short, kinase-dependent ATP depletion is measured. High throughput kits can be purchased through several companies, such as Promega's 'Kinase-Glo \u00ae Luminescent Kinase Assay'.",

A common strategy is to use expression methodologies such as siRNA or RT-qPCR to first identify the kinases and phosphatases that are present, then perform further investigations using kinase activity assays to determine the activities of those identified enzymes. In many circumstances, the high-throughput analyses are stepping stones to generate hypotheses that require more focused experiments, and kinase/phosphatase studies are no exception. Each method has advantages and disadvantages (Table 1 ) which need to be considered when designing an experiment. Since kinomics is such an important aspect of cellular processes, it can be applied to virtually any disease. However, as a novel technology, the scope of current studies is still small.

Kindrachuk and colleagues examined specific kinases activated by in vivo Ebola virus infection [72] . Although many variables affect the kinases identified including the type of virus, species, and timepoint, several kinases have been identified in multiple screens. For example, Hutterer et al. showed Aurora A activity was upregulated during cytomegalovirus infection [69] and Gabrielli and colleagues showed upregulation of the same activity during papillomavirus infection [80] . Similarly, systemic screens of kinase inhibitors have proven useful in discovering novel drug targets as was recently performed against hepatitis D virus [81] in which GSK-3b and Cdk inhibitors were identified. Kinases involved in the host antiviral response against Sendai virus have also been elegantly characterized by using an interferon-gamma promoterdriven luciferase assay [82] which identified FYN and SRPK1 as novel contributors to the host immune response.

Similarly, screenings of migration inhibitors have also led to the discovery of potential therapeutic kinase targets [45] . These large screens of uncharacterized compounds are well complemented by other methods such as activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) [87e90], peptide arrays or siRNA arrays that can identify the specific proteins and pathways targeted by the inhibitor.",

In addition, the field of infectious diseases has been impacted by the discovery of kinases that are unique to infectious organisms; this can allow for rapid, sensitive and specific diagnosis testing as was recently described by Wayengera et al. for Mycobacterium [92] . Some kinases are well-known biomarkers of disease and many studies have actively screened serum, tissue and urine samples to identify new markers.

These estimates are based on the multitude of phosphoproteomic experiments conducted identifying thousands of phosphorylation sites. Organizing all of this information is a challenging task, taking into account all of the kinases and phosphatases involved in regulating phosphorylation reactions. There are several databases available for many organisms that organize the information we have on phosphorylation sites including Phospho.ELM [98] , PhosphoGRID [99] thousands of phosphorylation events in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species generated through mass spectrometry experiments. They give an example of using their database to study the protein structure found in phosphorylation sites using solvent accessibility calculations. They found that phosphosites are generally found in loop or hinge regions and are typically highly accessible to the surrounding environment. These results largely confirm other studies showing that phosphosites require accessibility due to the need to interact with other proteins in the kinase/phosphatase network.",

Phosphorylation site database (PHOSIDA) ([104]) is a database developed in the Matthias Mann lab that contains information on Advantages & disadvantages of high-throughput methods in kinomics. Many different siRNA delivery systems available. Screens can be tailored to specific pathways. Off target effects. Incomplete knockdown. Costly for large screens. Optimization required for specific conditions. Transient inhibition e short term. Unmodified siRNAs easily degraded by RNases. Real-time qPCR High sensitivity (trace sample needed). Quantitative. Targeted approach e tailored to specific question. DNA polymerase prone to errors. Non-specific binding of primers to other similar DNA sequences. Sequence information of target is required. Microarrays Affordable. Robust. Well established data analysis/bioinformatics tools available. Whole transcriptome differentially expressed gene analysis. Protein microarrays can be used for kinase activity. Dependent on availability of a good phospho-antibody. Can be difficult for some species. Phospho-Flow Cytometry Quantitative per cell. Characterizes heterogeneous populations. Can be multiplexed with other markers. Dependent on availability of a good phospho-antibody. Can be difficult for some species. Microscopy Once set up it can be automated. Live cell applicability. Determines cellular localization of target protein/enzyme. Dependent on availability of a good phospho-antibody. Can be difficult for some species. Optimization of antibodies needed for each target. Not highly sensitive for quantification. MOAC Can be adapted to HPLC systems for automated sample processing. Stable against a wide range of pH and buffer conditions. Non-specific binding of acidic peptides reduces efficiency of phosphopeptide binding. Requires pre-fractionation of samples with SCX or HILIC to acquire binding efficiencies of 80\u00fe%. IMAC Appears to be better for identification of multiply phosphorylated peptides. Can isolate phosphoproteins from purified protein samples. Non-specific binding of acidic peptides is an issue similar to MOAC. Less tolerant to buffer conditions than MOAC. Requires expensive equipment and HPLC expertise. Fractions have to be purified decreasing throughput. ABPP Can be combined with other technologies. Probe-bound enzymes can be isolated from complex samples. Not species specific. Selection of probes currently limited. Expensive reagents. Luciferase assay Relatively non-toxic, non-reactive. Does not require external illumination. No sample heating or light source drift. Extremely sensitive. Low concentrations of reagents. High throughput ability.Short stability time for some reagents (possible signal decrease during assay readout). Susceptible to luciferase inhibitors.",
