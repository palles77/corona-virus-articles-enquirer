            "text": "The percentage isolation of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli is far higher in the Indonesian series than the British or Australian reports, while the percentage isolation of salmonella is higher in the Australian series than in the other reports. This may reflect the popularity of frozen poultry in Australia. Some authorities no longer report the finding of the classical strains of enteropathogenic E. coli, for example this was not done in the Bangladeshi report. Others have not studied enterotoxigenic E. coli. Thus a total comprehensive survey comparing the aetiology 185 in developing and developed communities is lacking. The high prevalence of bacterial pathogens in the Indonesian study related to the remarkably high level of isolation of enteropathogenic E. coli. In any event the high percentage of bacterial isolation in the Indonesian series is related to the prevalence of malnutrition and poor hygiene in the community. This is well illustrated by the observations of Gracey (1973) in young malnourished aboriginals with acute diarrhoea in Australia, where there is a similar prevalence of malnutrition and poor hygiene. He found that from a group of 251 such patients, 47 excreted a serotype of enteropathogenic E. coli, 17 a species of salmonella and 25 a shigella. A similar high isolation rate of bacterial pathogens in another developing community was reported by Maiya et al. (1976) , who found recognized bacterial pathogens in the stools of 66% of a group of children under 2 years of age with acute gastroenteritis in Southern India, observed ovena 12-month period. Infection with individual bacterial pathogens will be discussed in more detail later, but the mere isolation of a known bacterial pathogen from the stool of a child with acute gastroenteritis does not establish that it is the causative agent of the syndrome. Feldman, Bhat and Kamath (1970) in South India have shown a dissociation between the pattern of clinical illness and the pattern of isolation of bacterial pathogens in an impressive epidemiological survey of pre-school Indian children. However, such isolation does provide good presumptive evidence of a cause and effect relationship at the time of an outbreak of infective diarrhoea when other children are found to excrete the same pathogen, but care has to be taken when interpreting the significance of the results of stool culture taken from an individual child with acute diarrhoea and vomiting.",

Animal studies have greatly helped our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved. Formal et al. (1976) have shown that in both salmonellosis and shigellosis bacterial invasion of the colonie mucosa does occur. This is associated with acute inflammatory reaction and mucosal damage and, in turn, there is abnormal colonie salt and water transport. In the animals studied they have also found that the jejunum is in a net secretory state despite the absence of bacterial invasion or morphological abnormalities in the jejunum. In these circumstances the diarrhoea produced by invasive organisms results from the inability of the colon to reabsorb the increased volume of fluid entering the colon from the small intestine. Enterotoxins are synthesized within the bacterial cell body and are elaborated into broth cultures containing intact bacteria, whereas endotoxins are associated within the bacterial cell wall and so are not found in broths unless there is damage or destruction of the bacteria. Enterotoxins have classically been shown to be produced by Vibrio cholerae but also by some strains of E. coli and food poisoning strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens as well as Shigella shiga.",

The ability of bacteria to adhere to the intestinal mucosa is an essential prerequisite for colonization of the small intestine and for pathogenicity. McNeish et al. in 1975 showed for the first time the relevance of bacterial adhesion to human disease. They showed that diarrhoeagenic E. coli could adhere to human foetal intestine whereas non-enteropathogenic strains of E. coli did not. Species specificity was shown inasmuch that E. coli which adhered to human small intestine did not adhere to brush border preparations from the small intestine of guinea-pigs, rabbits, calves and pigs. The fact that adhesion of enteropathogenic E. coli was mediated by a 60-megadalton plasmid was later established (Williams et al., 1978) . A plasmid is an extrachromosomal genetic element. Knutton et al. (1984) have developed a practical in vitro assay for adhesion. Adhesion is clearly an important early event for colonization by bacteria of the intestine.",

In developed communities, diarrhoea is usually a less important manifestation of measles but there are occasional children in whom severe diarrhoea accompanies measles.

This study does suggest that multiple biopsies would reflect more accurately than single biopsies the true state of the small intestinal mucosa. Barnes and Townley (1973) used single small intestinal biopsies to investigate the state of the duodenal mucosa in 31 infants with acute gastroenteritis. Their study confirmed the observations that a mucosal lesion similar to that seen in coeliac disease may occur in children who have gastroenteritis, as five of these infants had such a lesion on biopsy. Only five infants had normal small intestinal biopsies, and in the remaining infants mild (11) or moderate (10) mucosal abnormality was present. In three patients, serial biopsies after 3 days, 8 days and 7 weeks showed significant improvement.",

One of the three asymptomatic volunteers also developed mucosal abnormality. Biopsies 6-8 weeks later were normal. These authors used a multiple biopsy technique. In some cases, when two simultaneous biopsies were taken, the severity of the mucosal abnormality varied and it was concluded that the mucosal lesion involving the proximal small intestine could be patchy, thus supporting the observations made in the above childhood autopsy study. They postulated that the Norwalk agent initially damages the villous absorptive cell, causing acute inflammation.

This has been substantially indeed dramatically reduced but in developing countries, as Kretchmer (1969) has pointed out, a child under the age of 7 years still has a 50% chance of dying from a diarrhoeal disease. Gastroenteritis thus remains a factor of the greatest importance in the continuance of a high death rate in infancy and early childhood in many developing communities (Rohde and Northrup, 1976) . The annual number of cases of acute diarrhoeal deaths in 1980 for children under 5 years of age has been estimated for Africa, Asia (excluding China) and Latin America (Snyder and Merson, 1982) . This proved to be 4.6 million diarrhoeal deaths per year, a gigantic figure. Spencer and Coster in Johannesburg (1969) have shown a striking fall in mortality rate from gastroenteritis in African children, in the age group 0-11 months, during the 10-year period 1956-1966. They attributed this improvement chiefly to betterment of socio-economic and environmental circumstances rather than to improved medical services and therapeutic techniques. However, such improvements do not lead to a disappearance of gastroenteritis from the community but may in fact alter its aetiology and, also, its clinical severity.",

Furthermore, it was shown that the antitoxin activity of the mothers' milk correlated with its IgA content but not its IgG or IgM content.

Protection is diminished when the infant is being weaned onto solid food or cows' milk, i.e. when the baby is not exclusively breast fed. The risk is obviously far greater when these weaning foods are heavily bacterially contaminated. The problem posed by this in the developing world has been highlighted by Rowland, Barnell and Whitehead (1978) who have pointed out that traditional weaning foods used for young infants in West Africa can be hazardous bacteriologically. Thus providing a breast-fed infant with such supplements under the prevailing conditions in the developing world may be dangerous. Indeed, because of such weaning practices with bacteriologically contaminated food, infantile infective diarrhoea can continue to be very common in a community, despite breast feeding. Commercial baby milks and feeding bottles in such an environment can also carry similar risks. In such traditional societies, however, infants remain relatively free from gastrointestinal disorders so long as they are exclusively breast fed. Hence, the infant in the developing world is most at risk during the transition from breast feeding to a full diet. In such communities, all food babies ingest, except breast milk, must be regarded as being highly contaminated potentially, and so a cause of weanling's diarrhoea. Jelliffe and Jelliffe (1978) suggest that the situation can be helped if attempts are made to improve lactation in mothers by improving their nutrition, by persuading parents to delay introducing weaning foods to babies until the age of 4-6 months, by making the weaning foods more nutritious, and by using easy-to-clean plastic or metal feeding containers avoiding contamination.",

Approximately 500 million episodes of diarrhoea have been estimated to occur in children under 5 years in Asia, Africa and Latin America in 1975 (Rohde and Northrup, 1975) . Thus, gastroenteritis continues to be a problem of enormous importance in developing communities; for example, Papua New Guinea, where gastroenteritis was the commonest cause of hospital admission in children aged 1-4 years in 1967 (Biddulph and Pangkatana, 1971) . Its prevalence is a major factor in the genesis of protein-calorie malnutrition in such communities. In South Africa, Hansen (1968) has observed in a careful 1-year follow-up of 80 admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis in Capetown, that 12 subsequently developed kwashiorkor, 37 had loss of weight and failed to improve during the year of observation, and a total of 62 children had recurrent diarrhoea of varying severity. Walker (1971) has estimated that 20% of Australian aboriginal children in the northern part of the Northern Territory are admitted to hospital with gastroenteritis before their second birthday. Thus there is a close interaction between malnutrition, gastroenteritis and chronic diarrhoea in developing communities, and gastroenteritis continues to be a very important health hazard among children from such communities.",

Figure 6 .11 shows that in Sydney it is now a disease with a winter peak (Walker-Smith, 1972) . Such a trend to an increased prevalence in winter has also been reported by Moffet, Shulenberger and Burkholder (1968) and others from the United States. Ironside (1973) in Britain has also reported a similar trend in Manchester, and it has also been observed at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in London for rotavirus (Figure 6 .12). In contrast, Spencer and Coster (1969) in South Africa have shown that gastroenteritis is still a predominantly summer disease among the African population. Dorman (1972) has studied the monthly number of admissions to the gastroenteritis unit at the Royal Alexandra Hospital over a 10-year period and has shown that the winter peak appeared for the first time in 1964, and was associated with a 1961-1972. large increase in the total number of annual admissions. This pattern of admissions to the unit has continued thereafter (see Figure 6 .11). During this winter peak, most patients are infants and the percentage of bacterial isolations often falls as low as 2-5%. These observations suggest that a new, probably viral, pathogen may have appeared in Sydney in 1964, altering the pattern of gastroenteritis in the community. This is likely to have been the rotavirus. Gastroenteritis is often associated with poor housing, overcrowding and low standards of hygiene, but the Sydney survey in 1970 showed that many of the i.e. children from the upper socioeconomic groups. A geographical survey of Sydney showed that children with gastroenteritis came from all sections of the community, rich and poor alike. Thus it must be assumed that the mere improvement in living standards will not lead automatically to a disappearance of gastroenteritis. Such measures may simply result in a change in its aetiology.",

An acute abdomen is the greatest risk, and those paediatricians who care for a gastroenteritis unit are evermindful of the risk of failing to diagnose an infant with a surgical condition admitted to their unit. A detailed history carefully taken, coupled with a simple yet thorough clinical examination can usually exclude most of the conditions listed or at least indicate the appropriate investigations that need to be done immediately. These may include simple ward testing of urine, urine culture or a blood culture. Danger signs on physical examination include abdominal distension, abdominal tenderness and a degree of 'toxicity' out of proportion to the child's state of hydration. Abdominal distension or tenderness suggest the possibility of an acute abdomen and a plain X ray is always indicated. Sometimes gastroenteritis per se may cause such abdominal distension with a dilated gut. None the less, such infants should be observed very carefully, even when there is no evidence of obstruction on X-ray of the abdomen.",

Indeed, Colle, Aroub and Raile (1958) have shown that babies given feedings with high levels of sodium were, when they had gastroenteritis, more likely to develop hypertonic dehydration. Oates (1973) has shown in a study of 100 mothers of infants under 6 months of age in London, that 22 were making up the infant's milk formula high solute in a more concentrated strength than that recommended. This was due to the use of heaped or packed scoops instead of level scoops of milk powder, or even by using extra scoops. This risk can be significantly reduced by maternal education concerning the risk of using over-concentrated feeds, the use of low solute milk formulae, and the promotion of breast feeding.",

In fact, following publication of the Department of Health and Social Security's Report Present-day Practice in Infant Feeding in 1974, and revised subsequently, which described the hazards of high solute milks, there has been a remarkable fall in the prevalence of hypernatraemic dehydration. This change relates to the replacement of high-solute milks by low-solute milks for most infants under 6 months in Britain. The only way an infant can have high solute milk today is if he is given undiluted cows' milk. Manuel and Walker-Smith (1980) observed a fall in the number of children admitted with hypernatraemic dehydration to the gastroenteritis unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, and this trend has since accelerated. This change is illustrated in Table  6 .9. It is noteworthy that there were deaths in the early years but none since 1977. Indeed the disappearance of hypernatraemic dehydration as a cause of death has been reported in Sheffield, from December 1976 (Sunderland and Emery, 1979) and in the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, from 1977 (Arneil and Chin, 1979) . The relative importance of warnings concerning the overconcentration of feeds and the switch from high-solute to low-solute milks leading to this change is emphasized differently by the two groups. Whichever factor is more important it is clear that reduction in the solute load fed to infants in Britain has dramatically reduced the incidence of hypernatraemic dehydration and has been a major factor in further lowering infant mortality from gastroenteritis (Davies et al., 1977) .",

This variety of dehydration is sometimes incorrectly equated with hyperosmolar dehydration, but although hypernatraemia is the most frequent cause of hyperosmolality in infants, high blood glucose levels, for example, may also be the cause, and hyperosmolar dehydration may occur in diabetes mellitus without hypernatraemia. Some of the factors predisposing to hypernatraemic dehydration are listed in Table 6 . 10. Finberg (1973) has reviewed hypernatraemic dehydration in detail and has observed that the relative preservation of the circulation and the early presence of neurological symptoms are hallmarks of the disorder. The volume of the extracellular fluid tends to be maintained to a greater degree in hypertonic dehydration when compared with isotonic dehydration and so signs of circulatory collapse appear later. Their appearance is ominous because of the degree of water deficit by then apparent. In addition, the usual skin criteria for diagnosing dehydration are not accurate, the skin having a characteristic doughy consistency. The fontanelle is typically not sunken, and in many cases may even bulge. This type of dehydration tends to occur more often in obese infants, being related to previous high solute intake. There is a risk in such infants that the signs of dehydration may be underestimated because of their obesity. The state of consciousness is usually Prolonged fever hyperventilation Hyperventilation Salicylate toxicity Low humidity High-solute load in feeding Cessation of intake depressed, and some infants with a severe degree of hypernatraemic dehydration may have convulsions, which may be related to brain shrinkage, a drop in CSF pressure causing haemorrhage in the central nervous system. Cerebral thromboses may also sometimes occur.",

He has emphasized the importance of recognition of hypokalaemia in these circumstances and its appropriate treatment. Kingston believes that continued intake of small amounts of breast milk at frequent intervals while diarrhoea continues is an important factor in the infants he described, as the sodium and potassium contents of breast milk are so low (Table  6 .11). He considers that a different pattern of water and electrolyte disturbance is seen when gastroenteritis occurs in breast-fed infants, as distinct from formula fed children.

Glucose has been recommended for many years, e.g. by Darrow and his colleagues in 1949, and evidence has now been produced to show that there are good reasons for using it. There is coupled absorption and transport for glucose and sodium in the small intestinal mucosa and the absorption of sodium and water is consequently greatly stimulated by luminal glucose. Hirschhorn and his colleagues (1973) and others have found that glucose-electrolyte mixtures given by mouth or by intubation greatly diminish the intestinal loss of fluids and electrolytes in children with cholera. This type of therapy has been extended to infants with acute diarrhoea due to other causes, with great success. It has led to a great fall in mortality from acute diarrhoea. It is known as oral rehydration therapy or ORT. In the developing world the WHO or UNICEF solution (WHO-ORS) is most widely used. ORT is discussed in more detail in Appendix II.

Electrosol tablets when dissolved produce an adequate electrolyte solution for oral use, but as tablets they do carry the risk of being given in excess dosage. Half-strength saline contains no potassium and significant potassium loss does occur in gastroenteritis, but in emergencies this solution flavoured with a little orange juice may be very useful until other solutions can be obtained. There are risks of giving soft drinks in a casual manner as their electrolyte content and osmolality varies greatly (Table 6 .15). A glucose-electrolyte mixture (GEM) was used at Queen Elizabeth Hospital for children from 1952 to 1980. Its composition was based on one devised by the Medical Research Council in 1952. It was similar to the first solution used by Darrow. Its composition is indicated in Table 6 .14. Its use was stopped for economic reasons in 1980 when a commercially available solution Dioralyte (Armour Pharmaceuticals) was introduced. The glucose electrolyte solution (GEM) used at Queen Elizabeth Hospital contained some calcium and magnesium because it had been noted that some infants with acute diarrhoea had low plasma levels of these electrolytes. In relation to more recent formulations it is interesting to observe the relatively high glucose composition of 50 g glucose/litre, the low sodium level and the use of citrate. This solution was used very successfully for almost 30 years. However, it was not used for children who were 5% dehydrated or more who were given intravenous fluids. This mixture was a ready-made solution and once opened it had a short 'shelf life' because of the risk of bacterial contamination. Hence inpatients only were given this solution at Queen Elizabeth Hospital whereas outpatients were given an oral sucrose-electrolyte solution known as out-patient electrolyte solution (OPEM). The basic electrolyte solution was supplied in a concentrated form and diluted five times with water at home. Then sucrose was added at home. It was thus hoped to avoid bacterial contamination.",

This has the advantages of compactness and convenience over an already made up solution but as seen in Figure 6 .13 it does carry the occasional risk of being made up inaccurately and so producing a dangerously high osmolality. Therefore a study was made of a readyto-use glucose electrolyte solution (Dextrolyte, Cow & Gate) in the outpatient management of infants with acute gastroenteritis (Trounce et al., 1985) . This showed this solution was readily accepted by parents and children. Twenty-two samples of the mixture as actually given to the baby were brought for analysis. The osmolality ranged from 291 to 308 mosm 1 _1 with a mean of 298 mosm 1 _1 . Thus in no case was there a dangerously high level. A disadvantage of ready to feed solutions is the risk of bacterial contamination once the bottle is opened. At present such solutions are presented in 100 ml bottles and parents are advised to discard the unused portion. If such solutions are refrigerated even when the bottle is opened and used again the risk of bacterial contamination is minimal (Santosham et al., 1982) . These workers showed that if the solution is stored at 4\u00b0C after the introduction of 1000 colonies of E. coli it will remain sterile 24 hours later, whereas if it is stored at room temperature the E. coli will, not surprisingly, grow freely.",

Thus it seems probable that in viral gastroenteritis, carbohydrate electrolyte solutions merely provide calories and are unlikely to have a specific effect on sodium absorption. These studies do show the virtue of a lower glucose level as currently in WHO-ORS solution (see Appendix II).",

The speed of this process of regrading will depend upon the individual infant's circumstances; in particular, the severity of his vomiting and diarrhoea during the acute episode and the persistence or otherwise of such symptoms. Regrading is usually done in quarter-strength increments, i.e. starting with quarter-strength dilution of the milk feeding with the glucose electrolyte mixture moving up to full strength in quarters (Table 6 .16) at intervals of 24 hours. This is a slow regrade. When the increments occur at 6 or 12 hours this is known as a fast regrade. The rationale for this conventional approach is based upon the following points:",

Relapse was most often due to lactose intolerance but was due to severe vomiting in two. However, the complications entirely occurred in children under the age of 9 months. This risk of relapse was confined to children under the age of 9 months. Thus it was considered that in children older than 9 months gradual reintroduction of milk was not necessary. However, for those aged under 9 months there was a significantly greater risk of relapse due mainly to temporary lactose intolerance associated with rotavirus infection.

Firstly, when circulatory failure is present in these infants, rapid correction of the failure is the aim, as with isotonic dehydration. He recommends the use of plasma or an albumin solution. Secondly, when there are no signs of circulatory failure but the child is anuric he recommends an initial infusion of a solution containing sodium, 75-80 mmol 1 _1 in 5% glucose, but no added potassium until urine is passed.

Antibiotics are indicated when blood stream infection occurs in children with salmonella infections, but obviously antibiotics should also be given if there is an intercurrent indication, e.g. coexistent otitis media. Their place in the management of enteropathogenic E. coli infections and shigellosis is controversial. Neomycin has been claimed by some authors to be effective in eliminating these organisms from the stools; intramuscular ampicillin therapy has been claimed by others to be more effective in shigellosis. There are also reports of neomycin-resistant strains of enteropathogenic E. coli, colistin then being recommended as a substitute. There is no general agreement on the role of antibiotics in these infections and some authors are of the opinion that there is no convincing evidence that antibiotics do the least good in such children.

Most rotaviruses belong to these two families. This technique is a useful tool for epidemiological study and is discussed later.

The prevalence of a particle in the population coincides with the prevalence of the disease Again, this appears in general to be true for rotavirus outside the neonatal period but with some exceptions. Davidson et al. (1975a) found no particles in controls but Rodriguez et al. (1977) found rotavirus in 8% of 76 control children. However, Champsaur et al. (1984) described three categories of stool rotavirus excretors. First, there were those who had rotavirus gastroenteritis; second, those with asymptomatic infection, i.e. rotavirus with serological response and no symptoms; third, rotavirus carriers. Burke, Gracey and Masters reported (1985) in response to Champsaur et al. (1984) that 121 (10.5%) of 1156 children with diarrhoea and 51 (8.6%) of 593 children without diarrhoea excreted rotavirus! These observations suggest rotavirus has variable pathogenicity. A comprehensive cohort study has been reported from rural Costa Rica who found a low pathogenicity for rotavirus. This was strikingly different from their earlier studies in Santa Maria Caque in Guatemala where there was a high pathogenicity (Mata et al., 1983) . However, the overall incidence of diarrhoea was much less in Costa Rica. They believe that the more heavily contaminated environment and the presumably larger infectious dose the children receive in Guatemala, may be the critical factors in explaining this difference.",

As long ago as 1929, Zahorsky described winter vomiting disease and, in 1973, two winter epidemics of non-bacterial gastroenteritis were described in north-west London (Sinha and Tyrell, 1973) . A study of monthly admissions to a gastroenteritis unit in Sydney from 1961 to 1972 showed the sudden appearance of a winter peak in hospital admissions in 1964, which persisted in subsequent years {see Figure 6.12 ). An association between this winter peak and rotavirus in the stools was reported from Melbourne (Davidson et al., 1975b) , Toronto (Hamilton et al., 1976) , Washington (Kapikian et al., 1976) , Birmingham (Flewett et al., 1973) and London (Figure 6.7) , i.e. in cold and temperate climates. The peak prevalence may approach 80% among infants and young children during the winter months in North America (Kapikian et al., 1976; Hamilton et al., 1976) . In some reports, the virus is not found at all during the summer months but in others it falls to a 20% level or thereabouts.",

At 40 hours they found decreased sodium and water flux, decreased mucosal activities of disaccharidases and sodium, potassium-ATPase, but normal adenyl cyclase activity. Unlike enterotoxigenic diarrhoeas such a cholera, under these experimental conditions, sodium flux failed to respond to glucose. Ferguson and Snodgrass (1978) have gone on to study infection of 1day-old germ-free lambs with rotavirus. They found a state of accelerated epithelial cell turnover with functionally immature enterocytes clothing the villi. If a similar situation exists in rotavirus gastroenteritis in man, it is clear that the pathophysiology may be very different from the toxigenic bacterial diarrhoeas.",

Rodriguez et al (1977) described dehydration in 83% of children with rotavirus gastroenteritis compared with 40% in children who did not have rotavirus in their stools. But dehydration was mostly mild to moderate. It has, however, become clear that rotavirus gastroenteritis may on occasion be associated with a much more severe illness, and death has been reported from Canada (Carlson et al, 1978) and Australia (Bishop et al, 1973) . Fatal rotavirus gastroenteritis does not appear to have been documented yet in Britain although a child brought dead to Queen Elizabeth Hospital following a diarrhoeal illness had rotavirus found in his gut lumen at post-mortem. Nevertheless, it now is clear that rotavirus may be a major cause of diarrhoea-related infantile death (Carlson et al, 1978) .

It does, in fact, seem clear that rotavirus can be a cause of gastroenteritis in the neonate, as suggested by Bishop et al. (1976) . Quite severe symptoms have been observed in premature babies in some special care baby units (Bryden et al., 1982) . The role of rotavirus antibodies in protecting the infants against rotavirus infection is uncertain. A clue to why some with stool rotavirus do not get clinical disease is provided by Murphy et al., who found that children who had in their stools viruses coated with an 'antibody-like' material did not get diarrhoea. It is known from the work of Matthews et al. (1976) that breast milk and cows' milk contain non-antibody virus inhibitor and this may play a role too. So neonates appear to be relatively immune to serious rotavirus infection. Rotavirus has now been described to occur endemically among neonates in hospital nurseries in a number of countries as well as England and Australia, namely the United States and Sweden (Grillner et al., 1985) . In these studies rotavirus infection occurred throughout the year without any obvious seasonal variation. Another feature is the difficulty in eradicating the virus from nurseries. This may relate to the role of the staff. Hjelt et al. (1985) have looked at rotavirus infection in the nursing staff in paediatric wards; 36% of staff in the infant/toddler wards had rotavirus. All members of the staff had rotavirus Ig A or IgG antibody. As it is known that rotavirus is present in the hand-washings of children with rotavirus (Samadi et al., 1983) , this study shows that nursing staff may contribute to the spread of rotavirus gastroenteritis in paediatric wards via contaminated hands.",

The children were examined weekly for rotavirus. There was a high incidence of hospital acquired infection and even asymptomatic rotavirus excretors were identified. In another study in Paris (Champsaur et al., 1984) using stool electron microscopy and ELISA, asymptomatic excretion of rotavirus was often found to occur in children of 1-6 months of age (50%) and in those of 7-24 months (26%). The authors found only a statistical association with the diarrhoeafever-vomiting syndrome. They subdivided rotavirus excretors into: \u2022 Rotavirus gastroenteritis. \u2022 Asymptomatic infection, i.e. rotavirus with serological response but no symptoms. \u2022 Rotavirus carriers. All these studies pose problems for the relevance of rotavirus found in the stool to the aetiology of diarrhoea in an individual child. This probably relates to the stability of the rotavirus in the environment. It is probably spread as an aerosol to the environment during the change of nappies. Thus the main reservoir of infection is the babies themselves. In the study of Grillner et al. (1985) one single electropherotype belonging to subgroup 1 of the human rotavirus was found throughout. Hjelt et al. (1985) have studied 25 healthy Danish mothers and their breast-fed infants. All mothers had detectable concentrations of rotavirus Ig A and IgG in their serum at time of lactation. These levels did not change during the period of breast feeding.",

Few samples of duodenal juice from the infants contained rotavirus Sclg and IgA. On the other hand, about 80% of the infants stools samples contained rotavirus Sclg and IgA. These disappeared from the infants stool after cessation of breast feeding. So it may be inferred that infants receive rotavirus IgG through the placenta and receive rotavirus Sclg and IgA in constant amounts via breast milk during lactation.

With rotavirus stool antigen, these workers showed a rise in serum antibody titre with a complement fixation test using acute and convalescent sera. A related antigen, Nebraska calf rotavirus, is more readily available. Fourth is an indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique (Davidson et al., 1975b) .

            "text": "In the first detailed report of the clinical features of rotavirus gastroenteritis, Shepherd et al. (1975) described temporary sugar intolerance in 2 of 30 children. In a prospective study of sugar intolerance at Queen Elizabeth Hospital of 200 children with acute gastroenteritis (Trounce and Walker-Smith, 1985 ) 45 children had rotavirus gastroenteritis. 15 (45%) developed sugar intolerance, 9 (20%) were monosaccharide intolerant and 6 (15%) were disaccharide intolerant. In this relatively small study there was only a statistical association between rotavirus infection and sugar intolerance. This was not found with any other virus or bacterial pathogen although the numbers were small. The glucose electrolyte solution used at the time of the study was much higher than that presently used so its importance may have been higher at that time than today. An association between sugar malabsorption and rotavirus would in fact be expected in view of the damage to microvilli in infected enterocytes (Bishop et al., 1973) . In addition, it would appear theoretically possible that severe and extensive infection could temporarily damage a high proportion of lactase activity of the enterocytes and, perhaps, also cause a transient surface block to sugar absorption by temporarily damaging the brush border membrane which would cause a block in absorption to all sugars, as proposed by Walker-Smith, Kamath and Stobo (1972) . The clinical severity would depend on the number of enterocytes damaged. Finally, Holmes et al. (1976) have suggested that lactase is the receptor and uncoating enzyme for rotavirus. This would mean that infants with their high lactase levels may be more vulnerable, helping to explain the age of most affected individuals.",

Repeat infection with rotavirus in childhood has rarely been reported (Fonteyne, Zusis and Lambert, 1978; Simhon et al., 1981) . In the former report a different type was responsible for the second infection but not in the latter. Reinfection was also reported in the Santa Maria Caque study. Antibody levels tend to rise with age, reaching adult levels at two years (Kapikian et al., 1976) . Children with pre-existing antibody have become infected, however. Infection with one subgroup may not protect against another. Infants aged 6-24 months appear more susceptible to infection regardless of the presence of antibody in their sera. Lower prevalence rates of rotavirus infection under 6 months may be attributable to immunity acquired from the mother. Bortulussi, Szymanski and Hamilton (1974) found normal amounts of IgA in intestinal secretions during acute illness and in convalescence.",

A single dose of RIT 4237 was given to 178 infants aged 8-11 months (Vesikari et al, 1984) . During 5 months observation after vaccination two of the 86 vaccine recipients and 18 of the 92 placebo recipients had rotavirus diarrhoea lasting more than 24 hours which was clearly a significant result. No side-effects attributable to the vaccine were observed. The two children who were not protected were primary vaccine failures as they had no detectable serum antibody responses after vaccination. It remains to be seen whether this vaccine will provide protection against all subgroups of human rotavirus. The epidemic in Finland, at the time when protection was found, was caused by subgroup 2 rotaviruses.",

Another rotavirus vaccine derived from rhesus monkey rotavirus RMV (MMU-18006) has been studied in Venezuela as it is more immunogenic (Flores et al., 1987) . The protective efficiency of RMV vaccine against rotavirus diarrhoea was 68% of 247 infants aged 1-10 months studied for up to 1 year. More interestingly, for the entire study group, vaccine efficiency was 100% against the most severe rotavirus diarrhoeal episodes.

They have been isolated from a wide range of animals and also man. These non-group A rotaviruses have been tested for in infants and adults with gastroenteritis by oral inoculation of infant rats with stool specimens from 16 patients. Six faecal specimens, but no other disease controls, gave rise to infection in the rats (Eiden, Vonderfecht and Yolken, 1986) . All these rats had antigenic evidence of infection as determined by immunofluorescent staining of their gastrointestinal epithelium. Vonderfecht et al. (1985) studied an enzyme immunoassay inhibition assay for the detection of rat rotavirus-like agent in intestinal and faecal specimens from both rats and humans with diarrhoea. Four of six human faecal specimens that induced diarrhoea in suckling rats were positive for this assay system. This rotavirus-like agent has a similar RNA migration pattern to a rotavirus-like agent described in adults in China. This virus, now known as ADRV, has been further studied by counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE) as a method for detecting antibodies to this virus from healthy adult subjects in China, Hong Kong and Australia. No outbreaks of diarrhoea due to this virus have been yet reported from Hong Kong or Australia yet 18% and 15% respectively were found in two outbreaks in Junzhou, China where this virus was first identified (Tao et al., 1985) . This antibody was also found in 47% house rats, 36% pigs and 17% wistar rats. These observations thus raise the possibility of animal origin for this virus infection in man. Flewett (1986) has pointed out that a good study to determine on the one hand whether animal rotaviruses do infect young children or on the other whether human rotaviruses infect young animals is badly needed.",

There are in fact now several other Norwalk-like agents which are morphologically similar but may be antigenically distinct. These include the Hawaii agent, the Montgomery country agent and the Snow Mountain agent. However, the relationship between these agents is not yet clear. The story began in October 1968 with an outbreak of acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis in a school in Norwalk, Ohio. The symptoms consisted primarily of nausea and vomiting but diarrhoea and a low-grade pyrexia were also noted. The disease lasted 24 hours and remitted spontaneously (Adler and Zickl, 1969) . A bacteria-free filtrate was prepared from the rectal swab of an adult secondarily infected during the outbreak. Administered orally, this produced acute gastroenteritis in adult volunteers (Dolin et al., 1971) . A 27 nm virus-like particle was subsequently found in a stool filtrate prepared from an adult volunteer, which had been aggregated by convalescent sera using the technique of immune electron microscopy (Kapikian et al., 1972) . Using this technique of immune electron microscopy of the stools, virus particles of similar morphology but probably antigenically distinct have been identified in other outbreaks of gastroenteritis. The Hawaii agent was detected in a family outbreak in Hawaii in 1977 (Thornhill et al.) . Then in 1979 a 27-32 nm virus particle was identified in a large outbreak of gastroenteritis in Granby, Colorado (Morens et al., 1979) called the Snow Mountain Agent.",

It is now possible for these Norwalk-like particles to be identified in the stools by electron microscopy and on the basis of structure alone to be distinguished from similar small structured viruses, i.e. astro virus and calicivirus, and from featureless small round viruses by an expert electron microscopist (Figure 6.18) . This technique of immune electron microscopy by means of which these virus particles were first recognized, also permitted antibody titres to be demonstrated and thus provided evidence of an association between these agents and clinical gastroenteritis. However, immune electron microscopy is a cumbersome, labour intensive technique and subsequently a sensitive and efficient radioimmunoassay for Norwalk agent (Greenberg et al., 1981) was developed. A similar assay has been developed for Snow Mountain agent (Dolin et al., 1986) .",

More recently, Treanor et al. (1986) have developed a monoclonal antibody to the Snow Mountain agent, the first monoclonal antibody for this group of agents. If this can be developed also for the Norwalk-agent this will facilitate the development of practical detection assays. In Western societies its clinical importance in children has been uncertain, mainly related to past difficulties in accurately diagnosing this particle on stool electron microscopy. These have now been overcome and since 1982 it has been possible to recognize Norwalk-like agents by their morphology. From the literature the Norwalk agent has in fact been associated chiefly with outbreaks of gastroenteritis. Older children and adults have most often been affected. One very large community outbreak was reported when approximately 3000 people developed an illness compatible with Norwalk gastroenteritis after consuming bakery items with frosting (Kuritsky et al., 1984) .",

Diarrhoea was an invariable clinical feature. Vomiting occurred in 18 children, abdominal pain in 7, and mild dehydration in 5, i.e. less than 5% dehydration. Fourteen of the children with acute diarrhoea were admitted directly to the gastroenteritis unit. The other fourteen children developed their acute diarrhoea some time after hospital admission. Although the excretion of astrovirus was associated with mild gastroenteritis, the presence of other enteric pathogens in 16 of the 28 children limited the degree to which the clinical symptoms could be attributed to astrovirus alone.",

Penetration of small intestinal, particularly ileal, or colonie mucosa by this 'invasive' organism results in fluid secretion and diarrhoea which may be mediated by prostaglandins released secondary to inflammation (Buchino, Suchy and Snyder, 1984) .",

In that year, Bray at the Hillingdon Hospital in London published observations he had made concerning the isolation of enteropathogenic strains of E. coli from infants with summer diarrhoea. It has subsequently been widely confirmed that certain strains of E. coli are enteropathogenic. The criteria for accepting such enteropathogenicity usually includes the consistent isolation of a particular strain in an epidemic as the predominant coliform in the stools of affected infants and its relative rarity in the general community.

Enterotoxigenic E. coli have been shown to produce two types of toxin. First, there is the heat-labile (LT) enterotoxin that is antigenically and functionally similar to cholera toxin. It stimulates adenyl cyclase, as does cholera enterotoxin, and also produces an excess loss of water into the intestinal lumen, i.e. a secretory state. The second toxin is the non-antigenic heat-stable (ST) toxin whose mode of action is via stimulation of another intracellular mediator (cyclic GMP) (Field, 1978) . Our understanding of these mechanisms of enteropathogenicity have been considerably expanded by animal work, notably that of Williams Smith (1976) . It has now been shown from such studies that the ability of E. coli to colonize the gut, adhere to mucosal surface, and to produce enterotoxin can be transmitted from one organism to another by transmissible plasmids. These are extra-chromosomal genetic elements. Thus plasmids could transfer the potential to produce one of these capacities, e.g. enterotoxin production, to organisms not ordinarily regarded as pathogens. At present, enterotoxin can be demonstrated only by its effect on animal models or on cultured cells. The development of a simple laboratory procedure that would allow rapid recognition of such an enterotoxin would be a great advantage and might demonstrate the enteropathogenicity of hitherto unsuspected organisms.",

Although enterotoxin producing strains of E. coli that cause a severe disease with profound fluid loss, sometimes referred to as cholera infantum, may occur such disease is far more common in the developing world than in developed communities. The best evidence that these mechanisms of toxin production and invasion are causes of human disease comes from studies of E. coli strains that cause traveller's diarrhoea in adults. In fact, most studies of classical enteropathogenic E. coli serotypes have failed to show that those strains, associated with sporadic or epidemic cases of infantile diarrhoea, possess either invasive or toxin-producing properties. Levine et al. (1978) have shown that three enteropathogenic strains (0127, 0128, 0142) given to adult volunteers all cause diarrhoea, but despite this there is no evidence of toxin production or invasiveness of these strains in extensive laboratory studies. There is evidence in fact that the classic E. coli enteropathogenic organisms produce their effects by a completely different mechanism described as entero-adherent E. coli of the cytotoxic variety (Clausen et al., 1982) (Figure 6.25) .",

The significance of the isolation of such a strain during an epidemic of infantile gastroenteritis is quite clear but its isolation from the stool of the occasional symptom-free infant is uncertain. Nevertheless, the isolation of such a strain from the stools of a child with diarrhoea under the age of 2 years is usually regarded as a significant finding.",

            "text": "Thus, to say the least, from the viewpoint of the practising clinician the present position concerning diagnosis and recognition of infection due to strains of enteropathogenic E. coli is most unsatisfactory. It is clear that invasive and toxinproducing strains of E. coli do exist and are not detected by conventional serotyping. Conventional serotyping continues to be valuable (Boedecker and Sherman, 1986) . The author recommends the continuation of the present routine serotyping of E. coli. Ironside (1973) has speculated that the disease may be due to the temporary clinical upset that occurs when new strains of E. coli reach the gut of the infant. A similar change is considered to be one of the causes of 'travellers' diarrhoea'. He suggests that a 'baby's trip to the local nursery is the bacteriological equivalent of the adult's trip to Egypt'. The incubation period for infections with these strains is believed to be 24 to 72 hours. Table 6 .1 indicates the isolation rate for these organisms in four hospitals in different countries. Within Britain itself there has been a change since 1953 when the MRC trial of prophylactic antibiotic found that 37% of children with gastroenteritis were infected with one of the only two serotypes then known to be enteropathogenic. This figure is higher than the present figure of 9.5% at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and the figure reported by Ironside, Tuxford and Heyworth in Manchester in 1970, namely 4% . These findings suggest a continuing change in the aetiology of gastroenteritis. Infection with enteropathogenic E. coli is associated with a high incidence of the post-enteritis syndrome.",

This is more common in children less than 5 years of age and is usually caused by Y. enterocolitica. Fever, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and less commonly vomiting last from 1 to 3 weeks. The stools may contain leucocytes and sometimes blood and mucus. Chronic diarrhoea occasionally simulates chronic inflammatory bowel disease {see Chapter 9). In children over 5 years old abdominal pain is a common complaint and often mimics acute appendicitis. Fever and leucocytosis are common while diarrhoea may or may not be present. Terminal ileitis, commoner with Y. enterocolitica, and mesenteric adenitis, commoner with Y. pseudotuberculosis, are found at laparotomy. Those who escape surgery frequently develop a right iliac fossa mass which usually subsides with adequate treatment. Pharyngitis may accompany the gastrointestinal presentation. Serious disease, especially septicaemia, is uncommon in healthy children and is usually associated with immuno-compromised hosts, cirrhosis, diabetes and haematological disease. Thalassaemics are particularly susceptible as they are iron overloaded, and being treated with desferrioxamine therapy, factors which favour yersinia. In common with other living organisms, nearly all bacteria require iron for growth and usually acquire it by producing sideophores which are low molecular weight compounds with a high affinity for ferric iron (Neilands 1981) . In mammals, the bacteria must compete for available iron with lactoferrin or transferrin. The bound iron is then internalized by specific membrane receptors allowing the bacteria to multiply in tissues (Finkelstein, Sciortina and Mclntosh, 1983) .",

It is likely that yersinia has receptors for desferrioxamine and can utilize the bound iron directly, thus increasing its virulence. In mice with yersinia infections, prior administration of desferrioxamine reduced the median lethal dose 100 000 fold compared with mice pre-treated with iron dextran (Robins-Browne et al., 1985) . In addition, continued administration of desferrioxamine led to yersinia septicaemia in adults with ironoverload and in normal children with iron poisoning (Melby et al., 1982) .",

Five patients had recently returned from abroad, chiefly from developing countries. The clinical associations of the 25 children who had no other pathogen is shown in Table 6 .22. Four children had bloody diarrhoea. Only six patients were admitted to hospital. Thus aeromonas infection is rarely associated with serious sequelae, other than in the immunosuppressed patient.

Some looseness of stools may persist for a few days. However, there is no worsening of diarrhoea, return of vomiting or further risk of dehydration and weight gain is satisfactory, once there is adequate calorie intake. Thus there is uneventful recovery. In some infants recovery is delayed. Most often this may present as an intolerance to milk as this is reintroduced into the child's diet i.e. there is a failed re-regrade or a clinical relapse requiring the child to return to a glucose electrolyte solution or even require an intravenous infusion. When such delayed recovery occurs up to 2 weeks after the commencement of oral rehydration therapy it is likely to be part of the natural history of the gastrointestinal infection as most cases of gastroenteritis especially those of viral origin are associated with pathogen excretion in the stools for no more than 10 days to a fortnight. Hence during this period any clinical problem with relapse of symptoms may be embraced by the umbrella term delayed recovery. Although this term does extend beyond this period, once 2 weeks have elapsed then persistence of symptoms must be regarded as being part of the post-enteritis syndrome. This then must be regarded as a problem extending beyond the expected period of spontaneous recovery.

This can be demonstrated indirectly by estimating plasma vitamin A (a fat-soluble vitamin) at the time of acute episode of gastroenteritis and after recovery. This will show a low level, and rise to normal on recovery (Araya et al., 1975) , although factors other than vitamin A malabsorption may also play a part in this change in vitamin A blood levels, such as decreased mobilization of stores. Sivakumar and Reddy (1972) have shown impaired absorption of labelled vitamin A acetate in gastroenteritis, and steatorrhoea may also be demonstrated by a conventional fat balance.",

It may be confused with coeliac disease when the child's diet includes gluten. Indeed, the differential diagnosis of any child under 2 years with chronic diarrhoea and failure to thrive is an important problem. In these circumstances the following diagnoses need to be considered, namely post-enteritis syndrome, coeliac disease, cystic fibrosis, giardiasis and cows' milk sensitive enteropathy as well as an anatomical abnormality of the small intestine. Chronic diarrhoea without failure to thrive following acute gastroenteritis needs to be distinguished from toddler's diarrhoea in which there is chronic diarrhoea but no failure to thrive (see Chapter 12). Sometimes follow-up is the only way to establish the diagnosis definitely. Small intestinal biopsy has a key role in diagnosis. When symptoms have been present for 3 weeks or more after gastroenteritis, and there is doubt about the diagnosis, a small intestinal biopsy should be considered. This will demonstrate whether there is any structural abnormality of the small intestinal mucosa that may account for the child's continuing symptoms (Figure 6 .26). Such mucosal damage (small intestinal enteropathy) may be a sequel to acute gastroenteritis or relate to another disease entity such as coeliac disease.",

This shows that delayed recovery was a problem confined to infants under 18 months of age and particularly to those under 6 months. The largest group was under the age of 3 months at the time of the acute attack. In this youngest age group there was a clear male predominance. Analysis of more recent experience between 4th October 1976 and 20th January 1978 (Manuel, 1978) has shown a comparable prevalence of delayed recovery in the age group under 6 months, namely 30% compared with 27% in 1973. There has, however, been a reduction in the total number of children admitted under 6 months, and a reduction particularly in those admitted under 3 months of age. The reason for this welcome change parallels the increase in breast feeding in the community and also the change in artificial feeding from high solute milks to low solute milks {see page 22) between 1973 and 1977 {Table 6.23). Nevertheless, delayed recovery is more likely to occur in infants who develop gastroenteritis under 6 months, and it is also more likely to be a more serious problem within that age range. Gribbin, Walker-Smith and Wood (1973) also found that there was a higher incidence of delayed recovery in infants whose weight on admission, corrected for dehydration, was below the 3rd percentile. This was related to the ethnic origin of the children concerned {Table 6.24).",

This argument is supported by the further fall in frequency of lactose intolerance as a complication of acute gastroenteritis at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for children. In the most recent survey (Armistead et al., 1987) of patients seen in 1986, there was no case of clinical sugar intolerance (although the glucose concentration of the GEM was significantly lower). Admittedly, these were all mild cases of gastroenteritis. This was also found in a Finnish report of the same year (Isolauri et al., 1986) . Likewise the observation from North America (Groothuis et al., 1986) that replacement of lactose with either sucrose or glucose polymer in a soy-based formula offered no advantage is consistent with this view of the diminishing importance of lactose intolerance in mild gastroenteritis in Western societies (Lancet, 1987) . This is probably due to the decline in cows' milk sensitive enteropathy as an important complication of gastroenteritis due to the decreased sensitizing capacities of modern adapted milk feedings.",

This, however, was less likely when the double port capsule was used (see page 32). The fact that there is an important difference between those with and without enteropathy was shown by Gribbin et al. (1976) , who found that those with an enteropathy were in-patients for 3 weeks to 7 months, only 2 for less than 6 weeks, whereas those without an enteropathy were in-patients for 2 days to 10 weeks (a mean of 3 weeks). Thus the presence of an enteropathy was clearly associated with a more severe illness.",

This may be very severe as seen as one variant of the intractable diarrhoea syndrome seen at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and described as Traveller's Diarrhoea with a Vengeance' (Hutchins et al., 1982) . This concerns children known to be well in the land of their birth (United Kingdom) but who develop severe diarrhoea when taken to their ancestral homeland (Indian subcontinent etc.) where they are exposed to a developing community where they are in contact with a heavily contaminated environment. Small intestinal biopsy in these children shows an enteropathy with clear evidence of infection e.g. neutrophils etc. and bacteria may be identified upon the surface of the mucosa adhering to the enterocytes in histological sections. However, the electron microscope gives the most revealing picture. These children have intractable diarrhoea and the damage has persisted long beyond the natural history of the acute infection. A similar situation may occur in combined immunodeficiency syndromes where for example rotavirus infection may persist with an enteropathy. Chronic rotavirus infection is always associated with disturbed immune function.",

Haidas et al. in a pilot study found that IgA numbers in the small intestinal mucosa were reduced in children diagnosed as milk-elimination responsive enteropathy, largely post-enteritis using a horseradish peroxidase method. Surprisingly, using an immunofluorescent technique Kilby et al. (1976) found IgA cell numbers to be increased. Kilby's children were more heterogeneous but it is not easy to resolve this difference. Nevertheless the possibility that there is a temporary IgA deficiency as suggested by Soothill (1976) still remains. A temporary opsonization defect has also been described. In addition immaturity of suppressor T-cell function has been suggested. The relative importance of all these immunodeficiency states must still be regarded as uncertain. Another partial explanation may relate to the immaturity of the small intestinal mucosa. The thinness of the mucosa in infants with cows' milk sensitive enteropathy as described by Maluenda et al. (1984) is in accord with this as well as the apparent limited ability of the crypt cells to respond to enterocyte loss. This immaturity may be important too in the ability of food antigens to adhere more readily to the microvillous membrane in immature animals. It is certainly true that post-enteritis food-sensitive enteropathy occurs particularly in young infants and is confined to infants less than 2 years of age.",

            "text": "Turning attention now to the mechanism of chronic diarrhoea in children with this syndrome who do not have an enteropathy, the role of disturbed immunological function must also be considered. Avigad et al. (1978) have investigated the flora of the small intestine in children with the post-enteritis syndrome. They cultured duodenal juice and the homogenized duodenal mucosa from children with the postenteritis syndrome, children with other causes of chronic diarrhoea, and a control group of children without diarrhoea. They found no significant difference in bacterial flora as measured by total bacterial flora within these three groups. The role of bacterial colonization of the small intestine and enteric disease was discussed briefly in Chapter 1. Its role in this syndrome is not yet clear but Avigad et al. (1978) using an immunofluorescent technique were able to demonstrate mucosal antibodies against the bacteria grown from the luminal fluid or mucosa of the same children from children with the post-enteritis syndrome, and other causes of chronic diarrhoea. The finding of such antibodies was unrelated to the presence or absence of an enteropathy. Mucosal antibody to these non-pathogenic bacteria, obtained from the duodenal juice or homogenate culture, was present in 8 of 9 children with the post-enteritis syndrome regardless of whether an enteropathy was present. Antibody was also found in three children with other causes of chronic diarrhoea, but antibody was not present in the control group who did not have diarrhoea at the time of biopsy, except in one child who had previously had an enteropathy, and possibly one doubtful case who also had a previous enteropathy. The role of such small intestinal mucosal antibodies against non-pathogenic organisms cultured from the small intestine of these children is not clear in relation to the pathogenesis of chronic diarrhoea in children, but clearly warrants further study. Phillips et al. (1978) have used the scanning electron microscope to study the surface of small intestinal lymphoid follicles obtained on proximal small intestinal biopsy which was morphologically normal {Figure 6.29). Normally, no bacteria adhere to the surface of such follicles but as Figure 6 .29 shows there can be adhesion of rod-like bacteria to the surface, whereas bacteria were not adhering to the rest of the biopsy. This was a specimen taken from a child with post-enteritis syndrome shown to be producing antibody to rod-like bacteria. This preferential adhesion of bacteria to the surface of the lymphoid follicular region is interesting because there is now good evidence that antigen entry occurs through the epithelium overlying lymphoid follicles, and that immunoblast cells are primed at these sites prior to migration to the lamina propria of the gut mucosa where they secrete immunoglobulin {see Chapter 1). Thus adherence of bacteria to the overlying epithelium of the lymph follicle may be related to antibody production and may have significance in the pathogenesis of this child's continuing diarrhoea.",
