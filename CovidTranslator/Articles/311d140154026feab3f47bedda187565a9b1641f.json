            "text": "Background: Viral myocarditis (VMC) treatment has long been lacking of effective methods. Our former studies indicated roles of calpain in VMC pathogenesis. This study aimed at verifying the potential of calpain in Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-induced myocarditis treatment. Methods: A transgenic mouse overexpressing the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin, was introduced in the study. VMC mouse model was established via intraperitoneal injection of CVB3 in transgenic and wild mouse respectively. Myocardial injury was assayed histologically (HE staining and pathology grading) and serologically (myocardial damage markers of CK-MB and cTnI). CVB3 replication was observed in vivo and in vitro via the capsid protein VP1 detection or virus titration. Inflammation/fibrotic factors of MPO, perforin, IFN\u03b3, IL17, Smad3 and MMP2 were evaluated using western blot or immunohistology stain. Role of calpain in regulating fibroblast migration was studied in scratch assays. Results: Calpastatin overexpression ameliorated myocardial injury induced by CVB3 infection significantly in transgenic mouse indicated by reduced peripheral CK-MB and cTnI levels and improved histology injury. Comparing with CVB3-infected wild type mouse, the transgenic mouse heart tissue carried lower virus load. The inflammation factors of MPO, perforin, IFN\u03b3 and IL17 were down-regulated accompanied with fibrotic agents of Smad3 and MMP2 inhibition. And calpain participated in the migration of fibroblasts in vitro, which further proves its role in regulating fibrosis. Conclusion: Calpain plays dual roles of facilitating CVB3 replication and inflammation promotion. Calpain inhibition in CVB3-induced myocarditis showed significant treatment effect. Calpain might be a novel target for VMC treatment in clinical practices.",

            "text": "Viral myocarditis (VMC) is a common cardiovascular disease in clinical practice [1] . While many VMC cases showed a self-limited regression, there are still approximately 30% cases progressing into dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure that might require mechanical circulatory support or heart transplant at the end stage despite of the optimal pharmacotherapy [1, 2] . So an effective treatment of VMC in the early stage is meaningful. VMC treatment has always been a challenge, especially with regard to the immunosuppressive treatment [2] . Many researchers considered VMC an autoimmune disease [3] , which made immunosuppression treatment reasonable. However, virus persistence in the myocardium [1, 4] holds back the intended host immune suppression because this might enhance virus replication. Clinical observations of myocarditis immunosuppression therapy also returned controversial results [1] . As such, guidelines also weight the words on this issue [2] .",

Although there might be some background levels of expression of the above factors, it is reasonable considering the wide spread of inflammatory cells even in physiology conditions without virus infection. Actually, a variety of inflammation factors whose production or secretion were regulated by calpain have been reported elsewhere including IL5 [26] , IL6 [27] , IL16 [28] and IL33 [29] . Combined what we have reported in this paper, we could conclude that calpain participates in the regulation of a wide spectrum of inflammation factor production. Researches from PENG's lab [30, 31] in the animal models of sepsis and myocardial infarction have demonstrated respectively that calpain induces myocardial NF-\u03baB activation, which might explain the mechanism that calpain regulates inflammation factors production. Data from another group of our lab also found the role of calpain in regulating NF-\u03baB activity in CVB3-induced myocarditis mice (unpublished data).",

So we further observed the effect of calpain on myocardium fibrosis. As we have mentioned here that Smad3/MMP2 pathway was inhibited in the transgenic mouse indicating role of calpain in regulating this classic fibrosis pathway. This was coincided with what PENG's lab have demonstrates that calpain inhibition ameliorates myocardial remodeling after myocardial infarction [31] and myocardial fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy [34] . What's more, we also observed the role of calpain in regulating fibroblasts migration in vitro and found calpain inhibition hinders fibroblast migration in scratch assays. This might explain in a novel angle the mechanisms of calpain in mediating fibrosis.",
