Lesions most frequently involved both the peripheral zone and the central zone (62 cases; 56.4%). Regarding lesion morphology, 56 cases (50.1%) demonstrated patchy shadows that were partially fused into large areas. Thirty cases showed ground-glass opacity (27.3%), 30 cases showed the consolidation change (27.3%), and the remaining 50 cases showed both types of changes (45.4%). The progressing stage was the most common stage (54 cases; 49.1%). CT results showed a negative correlation with SPO 2 and lymphocyte numbers (p<0.05), with rvalues of \u00c00.446 and \u00c00.780, respectively. CONCLUSION: Spiral CT is a sensitive examination method, which can be applied to make an early diagnosis and for evaluation of progression, with a diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy better than that of nucleic acid detection.",

These CT manifestations reflect the pathological process of lung injury in patients with viral pneumonia 3,4 and the distribution of most of the lesions are in the peripheral zone of the lungs, peripheral bronchus, and alveoli. This distribution may be related to the infection mode of viral pneumoniadrespiratory droplet transmission. With the progression of the disease, the number of lesions increases and expands to involve multiple lung lobes, and the lesions become denser. GGO coexists with consolidation or cord shadows. If viral pneumonia has not been effectively inhibited clinically, it progresses to the severe stage, demonstrating diffuse lesions in both lungs, and white lung with air bronchogram sign in a few cases.",

Three days later, the CT examination showed abnormal findings in the lungs. From the above analysis, it is evident that in this specific period and under the current clinical situation, patients with an abnormal chest CT examination should be quarantined, and the patient's epidemiological history should be investigated. After consideration of other test results, and excluding influenza and mycoplasma infection, at least one or more SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests are required; however, some studies have shown that the accuracy rate of the CT examination in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was only 76.4%. Only three cases (2.6%) in this study showed no apparent abnormalities in the lungs at the initial CT examination, and the overall accuracy rate of CT examination in the present study was 97.3%, which is much higher than the accuracy reported in the literature. The reason may be that the present study is a retrospective analysis and, in order to summarise the CT imaging characteristics better, the selected cases were all confirmed cases.",

There was no correlation between CT stage and hypersensitive C-reactive protein. Therefore, the changes of SPO 2 and lymphocyte numbers can reflect the progress of CT imaging to a certain extent, although the correlation was not significant.

For patients without visible lung signs but with clinical symptoms, lung CT should be rechecked in 3e5 days. (2) Positive lung CT results instead of the positive nucleic acid test should be used as a criterion for admission to the quarantine ward. (3) Hospitalised patients should undergo CT examinations every 5e7 days, and a low-dose scan should be employed. In summary, clinicians and radiologists should recognise the importance of chest CT in the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, be familiar with the features and diagnostic points of the chest imaging of COVID-19, and strengthen communication within the radiology community, which is especially crucial in the battle against COVID-19.",
