Seasonal peaks in influenza circulation were observed during the months of May, June, and October, with the largest peak corresponding with the primary rainfall season. Of 470 specimens collected from children under aged 5 who were tested for multiple respiratory viruses, a viral respiratory pathogen was detected in 401 \u2044 470 (85%) of specimens. Commonly detected viruses were RSV (113 of 470 specimens, 24%), rhinoviruses (85 \u2044 470, 18%), influenza (77 \u2044 470, 16%), and parainfluenza (75 \u2044 470, 16%).",

[1] [2] [3] [4] As a result of constant genetic mutations in the influenza virus, the effectiveness of vaccination depends on the continuous monitoring of circulating strains globally. 5 Influenza virus infections contribute substantially to the annual burden of respiratory illness in temperate regions of the globe. While there is a growing body of evidence to suggest that this is also the case in tropical regions, 6, 7 tropical and developing countries remain underrepresented in global surveillance data, and there is limited information available that can be used to inform influenza vaccination and treatment strategies in resource-poor settings, such as Africa. In C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire, no virological and very limited epidemiological data were available to demon-strate the patterns of circulation of influenza and other respiratory viruses before 2000, 8 and the etiology of respiratory infections, especially in children, was assumed to be of bacterial origin. 9,10 As a result, sentinel surveillance was established in 2003 to characterize influenza viruses in circulation in C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire, to determine influenza seasonality and to contribute viruses from Africa into the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network. During the surveillance years of 2009-2010, a subset of sentinel respiratory specimens from children under age 5 years were tested for additional respiratory viruses to also evaluate other viral etiologies of pediatric influenza-like illness. In this study, we use 8 years (2003 through 2010) of sentinel surveillance data to describe the circulation and seasonality of influenza in C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire.",

These sites were selected in 2003 using the following criteria: geographic representation within Abidjan; adequate throughput of patients consulting at the health facility; the existence of a department of general medicine, a pediatric department, and a laboratory; the accessibility of the site; the availability and the desire of the physicians to participate voluntarily without financial motivation in the surveillance program; and availability of a refrigerator (+4\u00b0C) for the storage of specimens. The surveillance system in Abidjan was expanded to 14 sites in 2007. Twelve additional sites were added during 2008 through 2010, of which five were located in Abidjan and nine were located in the interior of the country with an emphasis on the eastern region, which is a focus of local poultry husbandry ( Figure 1 ). General practitioners and pediatricians were trained on respiratory specimen collection, storage, and shipment of specimens to the laboratory. Supervisory visits were conducted quarterly to monitor the performance of each sentinel site, including validation of total respiratory specimens collected against review of medical records to determine the actual number of ILI cases presenting to sentinel facilities.",

Over time, this system, in combination with the existing ILI surveillance, will help to further identify persons at risk of complications of influenza.

Of the 28 sentinel sites involved in the surveillance, only one sentinel site (the Clinique du Grand Centre of Yopougon) was able to provide specimens throughout the 8-year surveillance period. During 2007-2010, four sentinel sites provided 50% of the respiratory specimens. This highlights the challenges of establishing sentinel site surveillance and demonstrates that the feasibility of a sentinel site to participate in a surveillance system in terms of administrative and clinical staff commitment, political willingness, and logistics of data collection and specimen transfer is critical to consider when selecting sentinel sites. It is also therefore possible that specific populations, and pockets of influenza activity, may not have been captured by this sentinel system-especially during the early years of surveillance prior to the implementation of molecular diagnostic techniques in C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire.",

Although this surveillance permitted us to collect our first data on the circulation of influenza viruses in C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire, during this period there was limited motivation among medical doctors to sustain the activity. This could be explained by increased workload, and perceptions of influenza as a benign or 'mild' disease, which was not seen at the time as a priority in terms of public health. For these reasons, our assessment of influenza seasonality was limited to the years 2007-2010 when data were consistently reported from multiple sentinel sites. A critical line of work for the sub-Saharan African Region is to identify better ways to provide incentives to overextended clinicians to participate in sentinel surveillance.

This plan called for the reinforcement of influenza surveillance capacities in the country and the strengthening of influenza diagnostic techniques within the Institut Pasteur of C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire. Consequently, from 2007 to 2010, the annual average number of respiratory specimens collected was 10 times higher than during the 2003-2006 period. This demonstrates the ancillary benefit of pandemic preparedness activities to the strengthening of routine surveillance infrastructures, which in turn will be available to monitor circulation during future epidemics and pandemics.",

            "text": "An added value of this surveillance system has been to demonstrate the relative contribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses to influenza-like illnesses. Our study confirmed the presence of other respiratory viruses in addition to influenza viruses as important contributors to outpatient ILI morbidity. This has also been demonstrated by other studies in Table 3 . The relative contribution of influenza and other respiratory viruses to sentinel influenza-like illness cases in C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire, by age, 2009-2010 0-1 years (n = 191) n (%) 2-5 years (n = 279) n (%) Total (n = 470) n (%) P-value* Africa. 20, 21 A large majority of ILI cases in children under age 5 were associated with respiratory virus infections, with RSV, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, and parainfluenza viruses contributing to medically attended ILI. The finding that influenza is also an important relative contributor to ILI across all ages also supports the notion that, if available, timely use of neuraminidase inhibitors could help to further reduce the burden of febrile respiratory disease in this setting. Particularly during recent years, data collection using a standard case definition from several sentinel facilities has made it possible to interpret trends in influenza activity over time and to interpret patterns of seasonality and disease intensity. The introduction of the first cases of influenza associated with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire further increased awareness and mobilization of resources during the surveillance period and strengthened the capacity of the national monitoring system. However, the question of sustainability arises today in a context of economic austerity and scarcity of funding. It is possible that limiting ILI surveillance to a representative subset of efficiently functioning sentinel sites, while continuing to establish sentinel surveillance for SARI in a few well-chosen hospitals, will allow the surveillance system to effectively monitor influenza virus circulation and seasonality and additionally provide data on persons at risk of more severe complications of influenza. Taken together, such data may also be able to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the burden of influenza in C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire and effectively inform future influenza vaccination and antiviral treatment policy.",
