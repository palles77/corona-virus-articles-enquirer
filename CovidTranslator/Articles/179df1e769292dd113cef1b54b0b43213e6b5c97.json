The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 disease is varied, and identifying factors associated with severe disease has been described as an urgent research priority.

However, the specific symptoms and comorbidities that most strongly predict disease severity are unclear. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify the symptoms and comorbidities predictive of COVID-19 severity.",

This will involve rapidly scaling up healthcare resources including staff, equipment, facilities, and training, to effectively identify and treat patients. To maximise the use of these limited resources it will be imperative that clinicians are able to triage COVID-19 patients likely to recover after a mild illness from those who are not. In order to do this, a better understanding of the symptoms and comorbidities (which are the first and most routinely collected components of patient data) related to COVID-19 severity is required. This can improve patient outcomes through three chief mechanisms: early clinical intervention in high-risk patients, designing appropriate clinical pathways and risk prediction tools, and the efficient allocation of scarce resources and expensive treatments. Further still, the early identification of individuals more likely to deteriorate can help direct appropriate public health actions to protect the vulnerable and prevent further spread of infection.",

Although the above criteria were used in some included studies, many defined only one out of severe and critical, with one (8) using a definition for a single severe/critical cohort. One study reported both severity and critical cases (10), using criteria set by the American Thoracic Society to judge severity. Secondly, the time at which severity of disease was determined was not always clear. Severity was assessed on admission in two studies (10, 12) , whilst three studies did not specify when severity was assessed (8, 13, 14) . It is possible, therefore, that the non-severe group included patients who went on to later develop severe disease. Thirdly, the time point at which symptoms were measured varied from illness onset (via recall) (9, (11) (12) (13) to clinical presentation (10, 14) . In the study by Li et al, it was not clear when symptoms were measured (8) . Finally, no study specified how each individual symptom or comorbidity was measured. For instance, it was unclear whether fever was objectively measured, and if so, how or by whom. Studies may therefore have been susceptible to measurement and reporting bias.",

Nonetheless, given the current dearth of contextually specific evidence available, our findings will help to inform future research and actions in other countries as the outbreak develops. Finally, it was not possible to account for the timing of presentation in the statistical analysis. If a patient presented after many days of being symptomatic, this may have affected disease severity, compared with an earlier clinical presentation. However, this limitation does not apply to comorbidities, and Table   2 shows information from individual studies on median duration of symptoms before admission, which appears similar between severe (or ICU) and nonsevere (or non-ICU) cases.
