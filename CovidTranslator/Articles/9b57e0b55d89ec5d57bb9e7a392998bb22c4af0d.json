For the past two years, I have worked as an International Young Scientist Research Fellow at the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, China. Many people ask me, especially Chinese graduate students, why an American would choose to come to China as a postdoctoral researcher. I think that a strong curiosity to explore something new should be a fundamental quality of any successful scientist. In 2005, when I decided to stay at Virginia Tech (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University) to pursue my PhD studies in biochemistry, I was actually warned by many of my colleagues about continuing my research in the same university as my undergraduate studies. At that time, I did not take this very seriously; however, after spending the last two years working as a postdoc in China, I think I can now really appreciate this advice. Although I would never have ended up where I am now if I did not stay at Virginia Tech and I am truly grateful for the experience and knowledge I gained from my graduate studies in biochemistry, I really think that the mind-opening experience of moving to China has helped me become a much better scientist.",

China is one of the oldest surviving civilizations and cultures in the world with a continuous history of over 4000 years and for a majority of world history has been at the forefront of technology and society. Although China has faced many challenges over the past 100-200 years, today China has enormous potential for growth and development and some people even compare China to America as it was 100 years ago during a time of great development and advancement. Even Napolean Bonaparte is quoted as saying, \"Let China sleep, for when China wakes, the world will shake.\" In terms of scientific research output, China is projected to overtake the United States in total number of scientific publications by 2013. Additionally, today many foreign experts are being recruited to China and many skilled Chinese scientists from top research institutes across the world are returning home to carry out their research in Chinese institutes.",

I really had no idea what to expect so I did my best to arrive with a positive attitude and an open mind. After spending my entire life in the US and the past 9 years in the small town of Blacksburg, Virginia, living and working in Beijing really presented a completely different environment to adapt and grow in. Even everyday life and simple language became a difficult task and figuring out how things worked in my new lab also took a lot of effort to adjust to. I had to learn so many new things that I was forced to keep an open mind and adapt or become helpless. As scientists who become experts in our fields of research, there is a real danger of losing the creative attitude necessary to be open to novel ideas that can push the boundaries of the established understanding. When approaching a new scientific problem or debating some research ideas with colleagues or even reviewers, I always try to stay open minded and flexible to learn as much as I can. Many top Chinese scientists spend time studying abroad in research institutes all over the world, and perhaps this is an experience that we have in common.",

Almost all of the work going on in Professor Gao's lab is very team orientated, which is a key factor in the success of most of the projects. For protein structure experiments, as an example, whether it's starting from protein Chris with some lab members of the George Fu Gao lab in front of the Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China. expression systems, purification, functional studies, crystallization, data collection and processing, and all the way to manuscript preparation, it is virtually impossible for a single individual to successfully complete all the necessary steps on their own. Even for the protein purification, functional analysis, and crystal screening process alone, in most cases this must be done against the clock, as many proteins are unstable and denature rather quickly. Therefore the ability to work in groups is extremely valuable for increasing the efficiency and success of many experiments. In science, practically all discoveries are based upon some knowledge that was discovered previously. Furthermore, the biggest discoveries are almost always based upon the efforts of many individuals over many years of time. On the large scale, it is extremely important that scientists all over the world can collaborate to provide new scientific breakthroughs that can improve the quality of human life. I sincerely hope that both the United States and China will continue to promote and support collaboration and exchange between our scientists to foster the advancement of science for people everywhere.",
