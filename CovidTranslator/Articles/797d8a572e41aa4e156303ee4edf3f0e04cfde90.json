Close contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals can expose people to high concentrations of aerosolized respiratory droplets that increases the risk of transmission 5\uff0c6, 8\uff0c9 . Fecal shedding has been demonstrated from some patients and its significance for COVID-19 to be determined. 7, 10 COVID-19 is characterized by a long incubation period with most cases occurring approximately four to five days after exposure 11 and there is strong evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted by individuals who are mildly ill or even asymptomatic. 12, 13 Sometimes, patients can have delayed onset of symptoms or have absence of typical symptoms including fever. 14, 15 .",

Prior to their appointment, patients are screened at a screening checkpoint to determine if they are exhibiting signs of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. For example, initially all individuals undergo infrared temperature detection before entering the radiation oncology facility (Figure 2 ). This type of temperature measurement uses a portable infrared thermometer to measure the temperature of the patient's head from a distance. 19 All medical staff receive training regarding the appropriate protocols and procedures to follow if patients have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 or if they have fever. Physicians are trained to understand and recognize the clinical features of COVID-19. If patients are suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 or if they have a fever, then their current radiation therapy treatment is on hold and the emergency procedure is enacted. The emergency procedure is outlined in section 1.5. For patients who have confirmed COVID-19, the evaluation and treatment of their acute infection takes precedence. For pre-screened patients who do not have suspected or confirmed COVID-19, they can continue to undergo their radiation treatments and follow-up appointments as scheduled. These appointments can continue as scheduled due to the strict implementation of the above-mentioned protocols and procedures to mitigate infection risk.",
