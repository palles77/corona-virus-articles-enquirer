Yet, if therapy loses its effectiveness, the response will have to be constrained and may involve unpalatable options such as isolation until death, the use of sanitaria or therapeutic communities. As has been seen in South Africa, isolative measures may have negative consequences, fuelling stigma and driving people underground, thereby reducing case detection and increasing transmission in the community. In such instances, innovations in communitybased care should be developed. Policy-makers and donors need to fully appreciate the overwhelming difficulties of the practical requirements of daily living for people in sub-Saharan Africa. The ability to work meaningfully for a living, to feed oneself and family, or to access social benefits, are currently not being met and, as noted recently in the South African context, there is a disincentive to seeking effective and appropriate care as welfare benefits are suspended to those TB patients who are hospitalized.",

Relationality and solidarity may serve as important principles in our response to TB. We also need to embrace reciprocity and put it into action -articulate what we can do for each other in order to build healthy communities.

Social justice concerns direct attention to the upstream causes of TB and the broader social determinants of health. Global poverty fuels TB. In order to create communities that work towards health for all and therefore contribute to human beings flourishing in the long run, the social determinants of health must be addressed on an equal footing with medical approaches. The onus is on the global community to change perceptions and create conditions where, through solidarity, we are united in addressing a grave threat to human health. This means addressing social determinants as an explicit goal of TB control strategies. Some of the reasons for poor adherence and loss-to-follow up involve the competing priorities faced by poor populations: the need to earn money on a daily basis, duties towards family members, substance misuse as a coping strategy for impoverishment. Overcoming these problems requires a level of social support that is rarely available in an overburdened and understaffed health system.",

HIV was discovered in 1981; within two years the virus was isolated; two years after that the first test was developed, and two years after that the first antiretroviral drug (AZT) was launched. This is in stark contrast to the TB world, where diagnostics and vaccines are decades old and the newest treatment method was developed more than 30 years ago.
