Depending on the genetic defect influencing the presence or absence of B lymph cells and NK cells, SCID may be conventionally categorized as T-B+ and T-B-SCID, the first being caused by mutations in cytokine-mediated signaling and defective V(D)J (variable, diversity, joining) recombination necessary for the rearrangement of the B and T cell receptor genes in the latter [1] . A defective T-cell mediated immune response and the subsequent inability to clear viral infections makes SCID infants susceptible to inflammatory lung damage due to infections with paramyxoviruses and adenoviruses, with high rates of respiratory failure and mortality [2] . Progressive interstitial pneumonitis with hyper-inflation reflecting the impairment of peripheral ventilation are common features of an infection with Pneumocystis jiroveci, as a co-pathogen with respiratory viruses [1, 3] .",

All newborns' Apgar score was 10 and they were vaccinated against tuberculosis and hepatitis B according to the Polish vaccination program; no post-vaccination adverse effects were observed in any of them. Two children, aged 13 and 15 months, received a live attenuated trivalent vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella without any serious adverse effects.

On admission, basic hematological and biochemical tests, evaluation of inflammatory markers and microbiological examinations including blood and bronchial secretion cultures as well as identification of antigens of infectious agents by PCR methods, were performed. Lymphopenia, with low CD3 and CD4 lymphocyte counts (see Table 1 ), low serum levels of major classes of immunoglobulins and flow cytometric evaluation of lymphocyte subsets of peripheral blood and bone marrow have led to the establishing of the diagnosis of a T-B+NK+ SCID in three of the children and a T-B+NK-SCID in the remaining two children. In four of the five affected children, a qualitative PCR examination of CMV-DNA in the peripheral blood was positive, whereas in one of them Pneumocystis jiroveci was identified in bronchial secretions as a co-pathogen. In the next T-B+NK+ SCID 15-month-old female patient, in whom cytomegalovirus infection had not been proven, the human coronavirus HKU1 (hCoV-HKU1) was the only one pathogen identified. In all the children studied, infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, rhinovirus A and B, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, influenza A (including A H1N1) and B viruses, parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 viruses, coronavirus oc43 and 229e, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila and Pneumocystis jiroveci were excluded on negative PCR examinations of tracheal aspirate samples as well as infections with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex viruses type 1 and 2 (HSV 1 and 2), hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) were excluded on negative PCR examinations of peripheral blood. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was excluded on a negative ELISA test of peripheral blood; however, in an immunocompromised patient a test based on antibody detection is characterized by a low sensitivity. Blood and bronchial secretion cultures did not show any pathological flora, either bacterial or fungal.",

The radiographic presentation of CMV-related pneumopathy in a child with SCID is shown on Fig. 1 . Unfortunately, none of these children had a HLAmatched sibling donor and haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was performed in three of the children. In one of these children, post-transplantation chronic CMV infection and graft versus host disease contributed to a fatal outcome. In the next two children with T-B+NK+ SCID, one with CMV coexisting with Pneumocystis jiroveci infection and in another one with hCoV-HKU1 infection, who developed the most severe symptoms of respiratory and circulatory insufficiency and were hospitalized in the intensive care unit, HCT was rendered impossible because of their critical state.

            "text": "The results of our retrospective analysis indicate that severe, life-threatening respiratory tract infections of viral etiology are the most frequent initial manifestation of severe combined immunodeficiencies. It is worth noting that administration of live attenuated vaccines against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in all children studied as well as against measles, mumps and rubella in the two patients, did not lead to vaccine-associated adverse effects in any of them despite T-cell lymphopenia, posing a high risk of complications. In as many as four of all five of the children studied, we found specific etiology, associated with CMV infection and in one child we documented an hCoV infection [4] . Certainly, such a small study group of children with SCID as a result of the proportional frequency of this primary immunodeficiency in the pediatric population [5] , estimated at about 7% of all PIDs [6] was under investigation, is the major limitation of this review. However, among patients with acquired CMV infection, neonates and infants contribute to the large proportion of the infected Polish population, reaching 50% [7] . The host's immune status governs further viral propagation and CMV-related pathology, including interstitial pneumonia. Cell-mediated immunity is the main defense against CMV disease, including CD4 T helper cells and interferon gam-ma (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin 2 (IL-2) production, CD8 T cell-mediated cytolytic activity, as well as NK cell cytotoxicity. As inadequate immune response of CD4 T cells is a major factor responsible for lack of immune control of CMV infection, therefore, cytomegalovirus is considered to be a major pathogen in severely immunocompromised individuals as infants with SCID [8] and children with secondary immunodeficiencies, such as recipients of hematopoietic cell transplantation [9, 10] . Significant morbidity and mortality in immunodeficient hosts may result from a primary, congenital or acquired infection, occur as a consequence of reactivation of the latent virus, or infection with a new CMV strain. Severe, occasionally life-threatening disease, which can manifest with viremia, pneumonia, hepatitis, as well as central nervous system pathology may be observed both in congenital and acquired infections [11] .",
