They display evolution in real time as they acquire antiviral drug resistance, mediate persistent infection through escape from T and B cell immune system responses to infection or, at the experimental level, rapidly adapt to different cell culture conditions, new receptors and new hosts. Although biologists since the time of Darwin have convincingly inferred the existence of natural selection from the current species distributions of animals and plants, and their genetic relationships, this evidence is almost always indirect and observational. By contrast, virologists have access to the remarkable field of experimental evolution, such that adaptive processes that may occur over centuries or millennia in larger organisms can be observed in viruses over days or weeks.",

            "text": "The paradox that this Opinion article aims to address is the increasing evidence mammalian RNA viruses [1] [2] [3] and small DNA viruses such as parvoviruses [4] [5] [6] [7] . Virus sequence change occurs so quickly that phylogenetic trees of their genes are often temporally structured -viruses from older samples show systematically less divergence from the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) than those collected more recently. As an early example of this phenomenon, the distance from the tree root of sequences of enterovirus 70 isolates collected through the 1970s and 1980s showed a linear relationship with collection date; the calculated nucleotide substitution rate of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions per site per year (SSY) allowed the start of the outbreak to be dated to 1967 (ref. 8 ). The availability of virus samples collected over relatively wide date ranges, often stretching back to the 1950s or 1960s, has enabled more sophisticated Bayesian methods (for example, Bayesian evolutionary analysis by sampling trees (BEAST) 9,10 ) to estimate dates of origins and substitution rates for a wide range of viruses associated with recent outbreaks. Furthermore, these evolutionary timescales have often been linked to historical events. Among many examples, a nucleotide substitution rate of 5 \u00d7 10 \u22124 SSY in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome was used to calculate dates of emergence of various genotype 2 subtypes to 1470, a finding that might explain the association of genotype 2 infections in areas where the slave trade operated several hundred years ago 11 . On the basis of its substitution rate and geography of currently circulating genotypes, hepatitis B virus (HBV) was proposed to have originated in native South American populations and spread into Europe and elsewhere after contact with the Europeans in the 1500s 12 . Likewise, the origin of the four genotypes of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infecting humans was estimated to be between 536 and 1,344 years ago 13 , and this was suggested to be associated with the spread of pig farming; HEV strains of genotypes 3 and 4 in Japan apparently originated from the 1900s, when pigs were first imported from Yorkshire in England 14 .",

Abstract | Recent discoveries of contemporary genotypes of hepatitis B virus and parvovirus B19 in ancient human remains demonstrate that little genetic change has occurred in these viruses over 4,500-6,000 years. Endogenous viral elements in host genomes provide separate evidence that viruses similar to many major contemporary groups circulated 100 million years ago or earlier. In this Opinion article, we argue that the extraordinary conservation of virus genome sequences is best explained by a niche-filling model in which fitness optimization is rapidly achieved in their specific hosts. Whereas short-term substitution rates reflect the accumulation of tolerated sequence changes within adapted genomes, longer-term rates increasingly resemble those of their hosts as the evolving niche moulds and effectively imprisons the virus in co-adapted virus-host relationships. Contrastingly , viruses that jump hosts undergo strong and stringent adaptive selection as they maximize their fit to their new niche. This adaptive capability may paradoxically create evolutionary stasis in long-term host relationships. While viruses can evolve and adapt rapidly , their hosts may ultimately shape their longer-term evolution.",

This appears particularly applicable to those emerging viruses responsible for the numerous recent and often severe disease outbreaks that have afflicted humans, animals and plants. This impression is reinforced by what we know about the origins of particular viruses; the emergence of HIV-1 is indeed documented to be recent, originating from multiple cross-species transmissions of a chimpanzee lentivirus into humans in the late 19th century in Gabon and the Congo 21 . This was followed by various genomic changes associated with human adaptation and increases in human-to-human transmissibility in the subsequent decades that enabled its spread out of Africa in the 1970s to become a global pandemic 22, 23 . Recent outbreaks of influenza A virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus similarly have zoonotic origins with the associated public health concern of host adaptation and the permanent establishment of these viruses in human populations 24 .",

Relatively rapid substitution rates, such as the 1.38 \u00d7 10 \u22123 SSY (range 1.03-1.73 \u00d7 10 \u22123 ) calculated for SIV strains infecting African green monkeys 25 , predicted time spans of hundreds of years for these divergence events and strengthened concepts of their relatively recent origins. However, a subsequent study of SIV strains infecting isolated populations of Old World monkeys on the island of Bioko, Equatorial Guinea, 32 km off the coast of Africa, was entirely incompatible with this recent origin hypothesis 26 . Although post-glacial sea level rises separated the island from the African landmass over 10,000 years ago, SIV strains were found to be minimally divergent from those infecting the same species in mainland Africa monkey populations. These observations lowered the minimum substitution rates of each of the SIV strains by over two orders of magnitude and, extrapolated back, predicted an MRCA for SIVs infecting different host species to around 80,000 years before the present (bp).",

Viruses circulating in these prehistoric times in many cases matched currently circulating HBV genotypes (genotypes A, B and D) and were only 1.3-3.0% divergent from modern strains. This indicates a long-term substitution rate ranging from 8.04 \u00d7 10 \u22126 SSY to 1.51 \u00d7 10 \u22125 SSY, which is around 100-fold lower than that measured in contemporary samples (7.72 \u00d7 10 \u22124 SSY 39 ). Similar samples also provided evidence for the circulation of B19V in humans from Central Asia 5000 bc and in Vikings from Sweden ad 1000 38 . These strains closely matched contemporary genotypes (type 1 and type 2), and a similarly revised lower substitution rate estimate was observed. Whereas an early study of sequence change in B19V (ref. 7 ) predicted a time of origin of current genotype 1 strains to the 1960s or 1970s, the aDNA study indicated that this genotype was actually alive and kicking in Eurasia in the early Neolithic era, nearly 7,000 years ago. Further analyses of progressively older aDNA sequence libraries will undoubtedly reveal more insights into the pace of virus evolution for ever-widening collections of human, animal and plant viruses.",

Once endogenized, EVEs are genetically stable and preserve information about the circulation of ancient viruses that is impossible to infer from examination of contemporary virus populations. For example, lentiviruses were originally considered as a recently emerged group of viruses on the basis of the very recent origins of HIV-1 itself and measured substitution rates that place the origins of lentiviruses to a few thousand years ago 21 . However, endogenous lentiviruses in rabbits 45 , ferrets, Madagascan lemurs and colugos demonstrate the circulation of lentiviruses over almost the entire time span of mammalian evolution [46] [47] [48] . In addition to retroviruses, other RNA and DNA viruses have also adventitiously integrated into host germ lines and created records of ancient infections. On the basis of their distribution in descendant species, filoviruses 44, 49 , parvoviruses, circoviruses and bornaviruses must have all circulated over long periods during mammalian evolution 44 . In addition, the detection of reptilian hepadnaviruses provides evidence for the circulation of these viruses in the early Mesozoic, >200 million years (Myr) ago, long before the radiation of mammals 50 .",

Using inappropriate substitution models frequently leads to underestimations of age through, for example, the effects of saturation 60 . However, it is unlikely that even the most complex currently available models can accurately capture nuances of viral genome evolution (for example, the effects of gene overlap, epistasis and nucleotide biases) and reconcile these disparities in age estimations. Sequencing errors, now rare in next-generation sequencing data, could also elevate recent rate estimates, but this effect cannot scale over the longer timescales, over which rate variation is observed. Explanations positing changes in biology over time have also been put forward, such as variance in the fidelity of viral polymerases 61 , but it is difficult to see how such features could explain the wide-ranging observation of the phenomenon across taxa and over time. Perhaps the most widely accepted explanation is that short-term rate measurements capture population-level processes including transient deleterious mutations and transient beneficial but short-sighted adaptations for their current host 62,63 that do not survive in the longer term, whereas long-term rates more closely represent the true fixation rate of mutations over macroevolutionary timescales 57, 64 .

Infection of the same host over tens or hundreds of years or perhaps even millennia may drive the evolution of each host-adapted virus to evolutionary stasis -an optimized genome that is maximized in those aspects of its fitness that maintain infections in the host population ( fig. 3 ). This idea is consistent with the model proposed many years ago that close cooperation between RNA virus proteins and host proteins requires their co-evolution and thus limits their divergence 69 . However, this stasis may extend much further, not just to the amino acid co-variation within virus proteins but also to the preservation of nucleotide sites at synonymous coding positions and non-coding regions that preserve codon choices, RNA secondary structures and replication elements.

This pattern of within-species diversity typifies a wide range of other human, veterinary and plant viruses; examples of the former include individual serotypes of alphaviruses, flaviviruses, measles virus, mumps virus, most of the paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses, and so on. This pattern is also the norm for the vast range of virus species infecting arthropods and fungi, and represents the fraction of genome sites not under selection for fitness optimization. Variation at this level represents the majority of what is captured in temporal sampling and may underlie the generally rapid substitution rates reported for RNA and small DNA viruses over short observation periods. However, the sequence space is small and restrictive -changes at those few neutral sites may saturate at much lower divergence levels than evolutionary models typically expect. We might describe this constraint as a cage -not in the sense of the limited genome size of RNA viruses 70 but reflecting those host-imposed constraints on virus sequence change that create the appearance of much less sequence divergence and hence temporal depth than is actually present.",

The latter include components of the innate, cellular and systemic host immune response that directly interact with viruses to limit or clear infections.

Host jumps are associated with periods of accelerated sequence change as the virus remodels and regains fitness in an altered environment, very much as conceptualized in bacterial evolution 71 . Host adaptation after cross-species transmission is associated with rapid amino acid sequence changes of viral genes, typically those associated with receptor interactions and the evasion of innate immunity 72-76 but often pervasive throughout the entire virus genome 77 . Larger-scale gene modifications, such as the repurposing of the HIV-1 accessory protein Vpu to antagonize the cellular antiviral protein tetherin was a key adaptive change that enhanced the replication ability of HIV-1 in humans following its zoonotic transfer from chimpanzees 22 . The diversification of HIV-1 populations in the 100 or more years since its zoonotic introduction might indeed be interpreted as an ongoing process of fitness optimization. The gradual attenuation of disease severity in HIV-1 infections 78 perhaps anticipates a time when HIV-1 diversity is substantially lessened following niche adaptation and the evolution of fitness-optimized, less pathogenic and fully host-adapted HIV-1 strains. HIV-1 population structures and diversity may ultimately match the endemic and tolerated SIV strains that have infected and adapted to many Old World monkey species over much longer periods. In vertebrates, further adaptive change is driven by their highly polymorphic adaptive immune system. The heterogeneity of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules between individual hosts defines virus epitope recognition and hence the adaptive changes required to avoid antibody or T cell recognition 17, 18 . Immediately after infection, immune escape of viruses in different individuals may drive rapid antigenic diversification. However, the sequential transit of a virus through dozens or many hundreds of individuals may lead to a static cycle of adaptation on infection and reversion on transmission through different MHC repertoires. At the population level, there may be no net sequence change, an interesting variant of the Red Queen hypothesis 79, 80 . This larger adaptive space (but still a cage) feeds into a complex dynamic of population susceptibility, transmission rates, neutralization escape and changes in receptor use that perpetuates infections in hosts with adaptive immunity. The elaborate serotype and antigenic shift and/or drift population structures of mammalian viruses in particular may be its direct consequence.",

Although it is known that viruses evolve under constraints and adapt to hosts on transmission, the perspective we offer casts viruses and their genetic relationships to each other as being primarily conditioned by hosts they infect. Their own genetic history that is emphasized so much in virus-centric accounts of their evolution over short periods is quite subservient to the shaping forces of host-driven evolution. Similarly, although existing accounts of virus sequence change are so much focused on their seemingly unlimited evolutionary potential and adaptability, the range of viruses that are able to successfully infect and maintain transmission in their hosts appears limited and is more a function of the host niches a virus can exploit 65 . For example, the wide range of viruses that infect humans possess specific tissue tropisms, pathologies and transmission routes. However, homologues of these viruses in other mammalian species typically reproduce very closely, and appear restricted by, these same virushost interactions. As further evidence of host-induced constraints, virus replication ability, transmissibility and successful establishment of zoonoses are predicated, Viruses remain associated and highly adapted to their host, even as the hosts themselves evolve and speciate over long periods (tens of millions or potentially hundreds of millions of years). Viruses continue to infect cells in each host lineage, but they themselves must evolve in concert with their host to retain fitness and host adaptation as the niche they occupy gradually changes. After a prolonged period of co-evolution, viruses acquire very different virus 'shapes' and a phylogeny that resembles in part that of their host. Viruses involved in this co-evolutionary process display long-term substitution rates that approach those of their hosts.",

Indeed, more than any other factor, the idea that host-adapted viruses are exploring space around a small cage of tolerated substitutions accounts best for the absurdly different short-term and long-term substitution rates they display over differing evolutionary timescales. That small cage and the consequent isolation of virus populations from each other may frequently underpin what are classified as virus species in virus taxonomy 88, 89 , which we may now regard as constrained, separate virus populations with often highly demarcated host ranges. The model of host-driven virus evolution thus places viruses as long-term residents of the hosts they infect, perhaps over millions of years or longer, a concept that accords with the general host specificity that virus species display.

Rapid fixation of adaptive changes improves virus fitness associated with sequence diversification. Fitness competition over a relatively short period of adaptive evolution leads to the emergence of a highly adapted virus strain that is genetically distinct from the founder virus. The red crosses label lineages that have become extinct over the period of virus-host adaptation.",
