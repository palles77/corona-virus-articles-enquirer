The aim of the present study was to investigate dynamic fluctuations of peripheral blood immune cell subgroups in patients with critical H7N9 infection. Flow cytometry was used to assess the cells in whole blood samples from 9 cases. With regard to the innate immune system, in the majority of patients, the natural killer (NK) cell counts were similar to those of monocytes, which demonstrated a gradual increase in the progression period and an early increase followed by a reduction during recovery. B cells exhibited a reduction during progression and were further decreased during recovery. The CD4 + T cells of all patients decreased during progression, and further decreased during recovery. By contrast, CD8 + T cells increased in the majority of patients in the progression stage, and underwent an initial reduction followed by a gradual increase during recovery. However, CD8 + programmed death (PD)-1 + T cell and T helper (Th) 1 cell frequencies demonstrated a moderate increase in all patients during the progression stage, and regulatory T cell (Treg) frequencies tended to be reduced during progression and increased during recovery. Notably, this preliminary data also showed that the frequencies of B cells, Th2 cells and Th17 cells in the progression period were higher than those in the recovery period. The frequencies of monocytes, CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, CD4 + PD-1 + T cells and CD8 + PD-1 + T cells in the progression period were lower than those during recovery. In conclusion, different levels of peripheral blood immune cell subgroups during the pathogenesis of H7N9 infection may be associated with elimination of the virus and immune damage.",

Typical clinical manifestations include fever, cough, dyspnea and rapid progression of pulmonary infiltration or consolidation (1, 2) . Cytokines and immune cells regulate the immune response to viral infection, mediate inflammatory responses, and are involved in tissue damage and repair. Following initial infection, the innate immune system of the host, as a first line of defense, reacts earlier than the adaptive immune system to reduce further viral invasion or replication. However, too strong an immune reaction also causes aggravation, and subsequently induces lung injury (3) (4) (5) . Although successfully eliminating the virus is essential, the response of virus-specific T cells could also result in tissue damage and autoimmune responses in the host. Therefore, monitoring the variation of cellular immune functions in patients with H7N9 infection has important clinical significance, particularly in critical patients, as it would contribute to the establishment of a predictive immune parameter.",

            "text": "NK cells are the major effector cells during acute infection, rapidly killing infected cells in the process. Previous studies have shown that a reduction in NK cell count occurs mainly because the virus directly infects and kills NK cells, thereby limiting their activity and leading to their apoptosis (5, 6) . In a study of H1N1-infected patients, the frequency of NK cells in patients with severe and moderate disease was found to be less than that of the control group (6) . In the present study, for the majority of patients, although no significant difference in the frequency of NK cells was found between the progression period and recovery, the NK cell frequency demonstrated a gradual increase in the progression period and an early increase and sequential reduction during recovery. Notably, the patients with a higher level of NK cells in the progression period exhibited a quicker recovery from the disease. In conclusion, when infection is accompanied by a dynamic NK cell change, this could indicate that the body is in a balance between anti-infective immunity and autoimmune damage. Previously, mononuclear cell infiltration and alveolar cell desquamation have been described during the acute phase of severe acute respiratory syndrome, together with dysregulation of plasma cytokine levels (7). Exposure of monocytes or macrophages to viruses causes the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1 and IL-6, and chemokines, as well as members of the CC-chemokine subfamily such as MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1 and RANTES, which preferentially attract monocytes and lymphocytes (8) . In the present study, for most patients, the frequency of monocytes in the progression period was less than that during recovery, and the monocyte counts demonstrated a gradual increase in the progression period and an early increase and subsequent reduction during recovery. It is hypothesized that the increase of monocyte frequency in the progression period exhibits both immune protective and chemoattracting functions, and its subsequent reduction was important in achieving balanced cytokine production.",

In accordance with previous data concerning H1N1, which indicated that the frequency of B cells in patients with severe disease was significantly higher than that in patients with moderate disease and the control (10), the present study showed that CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells and B cells all demonstrated detectable changes, which included an imbalance of CD4/CD8 in the progression stage, together with a continuous reduction in CD4 + T cells and B cells. This could indicate that the disease progression may be attributed to inhibition of the antiviral immune response of T cells, thereby causing the CD4/CD8 ratio to balance during recovery, and a downregulation of B cell-induced humoral immune responses against H7N9 virus.",

However, despite the relatively low numbers of study subjects, the observations of the present study indicate that there are persistent abnormalities of these T cell subsets in patients who have suffered from H7N9 infection. In the progression period, although CD4 + IFN-\u03b3 + T cell frequencies increased, CD8 + PD-1 + T cell frequencies also increased in all patients, together with higher levels ofCD4 + IL-4 + T cells, which might induce the inhibition of Th1 cell-mediated antiviral immunity. In support, during recovery, the Th1/Th2 balance was maintained, and CD8 + PD-1 + T cell frequencies demonstrated a mild downward trend in the majority of cases. With regard to regulatory T cells, a downward trend of Treg frequencies in the majority of cases might contribute to an enhancement of the immune response to virus during disease progression, along with subsequent uncontrolled immune damage in patients with H7N9 infection (11) . It was also found that the frequency of Th17 cells in the progression period was significantly higher than that in recovery, which suggested that Th17 cells promote pathogenesis of the disease. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokine responses, characterized by a combined Th1/Th17 cytokine induction may be responsible for the disease progression of patients with H7N9 infection (12) .",

This could be associated with T cells, the peak detection of which may have been missed because of failure to diagnose and treat the disease at an early stage. Furthermore, a study by Cao et al has indicated that the incidence of severe H1N1 is highest in the 15-to 19-year-old age group and lowest for patients aged >65 years (13) . However, the clinical data in the current study indicated that the most severe H7N9 infections occurred in individuals >60 years old. This difference in patient age might be responsible for differences in immune cell differences between H1N1-and H7N9-infections.",

Each lymphocyte subgroup in patients infected with the H7N9 virus plays a more important antiviral role in the early stages of infection, but an excessive immune response leads to an increase of immunological injury, and establishment of immunological homeostasis is helpful to control the disease. Since the preliminary results reported in the present study were based on a small sample, further studies with larger sample sizes are required to verify and extend its findings.",
