            "text": "Medical countermeasures are key components of the US plans to contain or slow outbreaks or otherwise mitigate the medical and public health consequences of these threats, whether they originate within or outside of US borders. 1 The Public Health Service Act provides the authority for the Secretary of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in coordination with the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), to maintain medical countermeasures in the US Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) ''to provide for the emergency health security of the United States.'' 2 However, many countries and international organizations lack similar legislative mandates and, because of the multiple challenges faced in developing, acquiring, and maintaining sustainable programs for medical countermeasures for CBRN threats, pandemic influenza, and other emerging infectious diseases, there are very limited supplies available worldwide, which limits the global capacity to respond to public health emergencies. Because of this limited supply and the fact that many of these medical countermeasures are not commercially available, the United States, a few other countries, and international organizations that have acquisition programs and stockpiles have been requested to deploy medical countermeasures internationally to assist partner countries in containing a disease or mitigating the public health consequences of an event. A typical example was the largescale international deployment of antivirals and vaccine during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which evidenced the lack of global access to medical countermeasures and, due to multiple legal, regulatory, and logistical challenges, showed the limited capacity of WHO and donors to rapidly deploy vaccine to areas where assistance was needed. 3 The threat of future pandemics and other international public health emergencies has not diminished. In the past 2 years alone, multiple cases of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 have been detected in Southeast Asia, and North America has recently seen the first imported case. In the period between 2012 and 2014, multiple countries around the world, including the United States, had imported cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 4 In 2013, the world also witnessed the emergence of avian influenza A (H7N9), and in 2014, both the polio outbreak and the outbreak of Ebola virus disease in western Africa have been declared public health emergencies of international concern (PHEIC) by WHO in accordance with the International Health Regulations (2005) [IHR (2005) ]. [5] [6] [7] The lack of approved medical countermeasures, the limited amount of products available, and the impaired capabilities to quickly deploy them to contain the spread of these diseases and to treat ill people have proven to be one of the global challenges of the present time. These are just examples of disease threats to global health security and a reminder to the global community of the need to work together to develop capacities to respond to public health emergencies, including improving availability and access to medical countermeasures, and subsequently developing the capability to deploy them to places where they are needed.",

At the onset of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, WHO deployed more than 3 million courses of antivirals to 72 countries in the span of 3 weeks directly from a manufacturer and nearly half a million additional courses to 20 countries from a WHO warehouse within 1",

The success of this rapid deployment of antivirals was due in part to extensive pandemic preparedness planning by the WHO team in charge of the antiviral stockpile and by many other countries. In addition, the antivirals were preregistered or approved for use in most recipient countries by their national regulatory authorities, which facilitated rapid import processes. 11 In addition to the antiviral donation, and in collaboration with donor countries, the US government pledged up to 25 million doses, or 10% of its available 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine supply, to the WHO to support countries that would not otherwise have access to the vaccine. 3, 12, 13 It took nearly a year from April 2009, when the 2009 H1N1 influenza was first detected in North America, for the US government to deploy the first 5 million doses of vaccine internationally in March 2010. Based on WHO requests, which were in turn based on global demand during the course of the pandemic, the US deployed nearly 17 million doses of vaccine internationally by October 2010, more than a year after the outbreak detection. 3 The US government donation was part of a larger effort coordinated by WHO to deploy 78 million doses of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine provided by donor countries and manufacturers through the WHO Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Vaccine Deployment Initiative. While this was supposed to be a rapid emergency deployment of medical countermeasures, it took more than a year to complete following the declaration of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern in June 2009. This complex process yielded a number of lessons regarding the international deployment of medical countermeasures. These included the need for preexisting international arrangements for mutual assistance, development of intersectoral plans with a domestic and international interface for global response, creation of emergency use regulatory mechanisms for countries to deploy and receive products that are unapproved by their national regulatory authorities, and strengthening of the logistics for transporting medical countermeasures across borders. 3, 13 Legal, Regulatory, Logistical, and Funding Issues Over the past decade, the US government has received more than 20 requests for medical countermeasures for CBRN threats from the SNS in addition to those received during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. The response to each of these requests has uncovered multiple issues and challenges, and, as a result, the US government has dedicated efforts to analyzing and addressing them and exploring common solutions. Together with the lessons from the deployment of 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine, these issues can be summarized in several categories.",

According to the WHO after-action report, ''The regulatory and liability issues were noted to be complex and some countries did not have the resources to adequately interpret them and put in place measures to implement the necessary systems.'' 3 Negotiating complex legal terms and conditions, including liability protections in the midst of a public health event that requires immediate action (eg, containing a disease outbreak or avoiding the spread of a threat agent), can delay or jeopardize an international response, resulting in a significant impact on global health security. 3 Potential donor and recipient countries and organizations may want to explore in advance what domestic terms and conditions they would require to rapidly deploy and/or receive medical countermeasures, taking into consideration their existing laws and policies. Additionally, for any mutual assistance process to succeed, they may consider pursuing bilateral or multilateral engagements to discuss joint preparedness plans that include the legal terms and conditions that would be required to deploy medical countermeasures internationally during an emergency.",

The WHO prequalification process requires that the manufacturer in at least 1 country license the product, but it is not designed to apply to medical countermeasures that have not been approved for routine use in their countries of origin. Specifically, the WHO prequalification process cannot be applied for any medical countermeasure used under EUA in the United States or similar mechanisms in other countries. This may present a significant problem in future responses to CBRN incidents in which the only medical countermeasures available are unapproved in the country of origin and can only be used under special regulatory provisions. If a significant number of countries rely on WHO prequalification in order to accept medical countermeasures and no international mechanisms exist to prequalify unapproved products, recipient countries may be unable to import and distribute critical medical countermeasures to aid in response to events. A priority for the international community moving forward should be to foster WHO efforts to establish a new process for rapid regulatory approval of new or existing unapproved products to be used during emergencies or to determine how the current WHO prequalification process could be adapted to aid in the rapid international deployment and use of medical countermeasures during a public health emergency.",

In acute emergency responses to a deadly pathogen, it is possible that some of these requirements could be waived to expedite transportation. However, another issue that can make logistics complex is that there may not be enough transportation capabilities to mobilize medical countermeasures, as airlines may limit or cancel flights to disease areas-as we are seeing, for example, with the current Ebola outbreak. 23 Moreover, countries may issue travel warnings and take precautionary measures, including not deploying personnel critical to transporting, distributing, and administering medical countermeasures to patients. The ability to rapidly transport and distribute medical countermeasures during a public health emergency can be facilitated and potentially expedited by preestablishing operational frameworks or concepts of operation that outline the logistics of how medical countermeasures can be deployed, received, and administered, taking into account all the issues discussed above.",

Although this mechanism is established under the WHO Emergency Response Framework, it is unlikely that mobilization of resources through this process can happen fast enough when funds are required immediately to contain an outbreak that can become a public health emergency of international concern. 25 Similarly, the US government does not currently have specific funding dedicated for the replenishment of stockpiles after international deployment nor to cover transport costs for major international deployments of medical countermeasures. In the event of a large-scale or acute emergency response, HHS may request supplemental appropriations from the US Congress specifically for that emergency or may consider reprograming funds.

An example of these efforts is the 2011 Beyond the Border (BTB) initiative, which is a bilateral endeavor launched by President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in February 2011. BTB articulates a shared approach to cross-border security in which both countries work together to address threats at and away from their borders. 27 The health security objective of the BTB work plan focuses on enhancing collective preparedness and response capacity for health security threats, including supporting the ability to share mutual public health and medical assistance across the US-Canada border by establishing a bilateral framework for the deployment of medical countermeasures. Similarly, the North American Plan for Animal and Pandemic Influenza (NAPAPI), a trilateral effort among the United States, Canada, and Mexico, focuses on strengthening the ability of all 3 countries to jointly prepare and respond to pandemic threats. NAPAPI calls for the sharing of pandemic influenza medical countermeasures in the human and animal health sectors in North America during a pandemic event. 28 The Global Health Security Initiative (GHSI) is a ministerial-level collaboration among Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the United States, the European Commission, and WHO to strengthen health preparedness and response for CBRN threats and pandemic influenza. As reflected in the 2007 GHSI ministerial communique, GHSI members ''considered the need to develop a sustainable global infrastructure [for medical countermeasures] that would allow us to work together to counteract the health consequences of natural or man-made threats.'' 29 In the 2013 GHSI ministerial communique, the heads of the health sector of these countries and organizations recognized the ''significant progress [of GHSI members and WHO] towards building an operational framework for the international deployment of medical countermeasures which contemplates the legal, regulatory, and logistical issues to be considered during such a deployment.'' 30 For the first time, policymakers, regulatory and legal experts, and logisticians have come together to explore mechanisms to address the issues encountered during the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine deployment. These discussions are intended to assist WHO to establish a mechanism to accept medical countermeasures from donor countries or manufacturers and to deploy them to countries where assistance is needed to respond to a public health or medical emergency. This issue has also been examined during the 2013 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) meeting of experts, and the BWC has provided a forum for the continued development of these partnerships to address the identified barriers to the international sharing of assistance. 31 While ensuring the ability to deploy medical countermeasures across international borders is a key component of global health security, there will likely be situations where there are not sufficient medical countermeasures available to meet the needs of the global population. The current Ebola outbreak is a clear example of this. Although some experimental treatments and vaccines exist at various degrees of development and in limited quantities, it is challenging to ramp up production, conduct clinical trials, and distribute the scarce resources in a fair and equitable manner. 32 This situation has raised many of the legal, regulatory, and logistical issues discussed here. It has also led to discussions of the ethics associated with using medical countermeasures that have never been tested in humans and, given the extremely limited amount of medicine available, if used, who should receive them. 33 To address these potential shortages in access and availability of products as well as transportation and administration capabilities, existing and new international collaborations should be leveraged to explore opportunities for pursuing joint international efforts.",

The GAP program focuses on increased manufacturing and access to both seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccines. 35 Similarly, other regional efforts have been launched.
