            "text": "Several longitudinal studies of the natural history of asthma in childhood have shown that the disease starts during the first year of lifein at least 30 percent of pediatric patients, in over 50 percent before 2 years of age, and in about 80 percent by the time they reach school age. 8 There is no evidence that early onset of the disease is associated with an unfavorable prognosts.t\" The general severity of asthma plays, however; an important role in the eventual outcome. When asthmatic children are followed up until young adulthood, it appears that most improve as they get older. 1.7.10,11 Patients who are mildly affected in early childhood have a better than 50 percent chance to go into longterm remission (>three years) between 14and 21years of age; the likelihood of getting worse is less than 5 percent. The remaining youngsters who started out with mild asthma will continue to have intermittent problems. When the disease is severe at 14, the chances of going into a long-term remission are poor \u00ab5 percent); nevertheless, approximately half of these patients will improve as they get older, but they will remain active asthmatic patients, and a few will even get worse. In a prospective study of 331 7-year-olds with wheezing before the age of 7 years, two thirds were still symptomatic at 21. 11 Others have observed a more favorable prognosis,\" but it is quite clear that the optimistic notion that \"most children outgrow their asthma\" is not true. Table 2 summarizes the general trends which can be expected in childhood asthma. Carefully analyzed, prospective surveys have demonstrated that childhood asthma is associated with a high incidence of hay fever, eczema, positive skin tests, and respiratory disease-related admissions during the period of 1980 to 1983. These statistics indicate that reactive airway diseases remain a major and costly health care problem in the pediatric age group. It is hoped that the application of enlightened and anticipatory care, health education, and appropriate self-management practices will reduce hospitalizations and office visits, lessen the cost of comprehensive care, and improve the lives of these children.",

In addition, there were 10,677,000 physician office visits for reactive airway disease in children less than 15 elevated IgE levels, the highest incidence occurring in the most severely affected youngsters. 8.13 A number of factors influence the development and persistence of asthma in childhood (Table3). We have already discussed the role of severity of childhood asthma on its persistence into adulthood (Table 1) . Heredity is another important determinant of whether reactive airway disease will develop. There is a 50 percent chance of asthma in the offsprings when both parents and a 25 percent chance when only one parent has asthma. When 1 identical twin has asthma, the other does not always develop the disease; however, the incidence of asthma is 4 to 5 times greater in identical than in dizygotic twins.\"",

Some allergens are more asthmagenic than others, and animal danders, molds, and house dust appear particularly likely to sensitize the airways. While food allergies can produce gastrointestinal and dermatologic problems in children, they rarely cause asthma. When food is implicated in the pathogenesis of asthma, it usually produces problems during the first year; and asthma is then often associated with eczema. Asthma is very rare in the children of primitive tribes of Western Africa. 21 It has been postulated that this is due to the endemic presence of intestinal parasitic infections causing high levels oflgE, thus preventing these people from developing IgE antibodies to airborne allergens. When they move to urban environments, and when their intestinal infestations are brought under control, the incidence of asthma becomes that of the nonindigenous population.

These include cigarette smoke, smoke from wood fires and stoves,\" cooking fumes, strong perfumes, and other airborne particles.

Most of these triggers produce airway constriction by vagally mediated reflex mechanisms (Fig 1) and can be blocked by inhaled atropine. 33.34 Emotional upsets and suggestion 35 \u2022 38 can cause acute bronchospasm in asthmatic children. While these attacks are sometimes initiated by hyperventilation, other eNS mechanisms are probably also involved. PRESENTATION coughing, and often fever: There are signs and symptoms of airway congestion, coryza, pharyngeal and nasal inflammation, and sometimes exudates. There may also be middle ear effusions or infections. There can be suprasternal and intercostal retractions, use of accessory respiratory muscles, and cyanosis. The reversibility of signs and symptoms, even with optimal therapy, can be slow in status asthmaticus, particularly in infants. In small children, this is primarily due to the small size of their peripheral and central airways, and the plugging which results frotn small amounts of secretion, edema, bronchospasm, and necrotic epithelial debris. The differential diagnosis in the young child between bronchiolitis and asthma is difficult, ifnot impossible, even when a respiratory syncytial virus infection has been documented. Whenever clinical bronchiolitis recurs, it is likely that the infant has asthma. I do not like to commit myself to the diagnosis of asthma during the first attack of wheezing; however; when an infant or young child wheezes and coughs with most viral respiratory tract infections, the diagnosis is It should be remembered that not all asthmatic children wheeze and that Wheezing does not always indicate the presence of this common disease. While wheezing is the most common sign of reactive airway diseases, some patients wheeze but do not have asthma. In these youngsters, causes such as recurrent aspiration, gastroesophageal reflux, pulmonary edema, foreign bodies, bronchial adenomas, upper or central airway obstruction by anatomic lesions such as hemangiomas, extraairway vascular channels, lymph nodes, or cysts, and even intraairway malignancies, may have to be ruled out. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis and periarteritis are rare in children but can cause wheezing. Cystic 6brosis is an important cause of wheezing and must beruled out by an appropriately performed sweat test. The reversibility of airway obstruction following the administration of an effective bronchodilator is a good diagnostic aid and should be used whenever the diagnosis ofasthma is considered and the child is old enough to perform pulmonary function tests. Chronic cough is a common variant of reactive airway disease. Many of these patients never wheeze and have normal pulmonary function tests, but have evidence of hypersensitive airways, as indicated by positive exercise provocation tests\" or abnormal responses to inhaled methacholine or histamine. 28 \u2022 38 The majority of these patients respond favorably to conventional asthma management. We should be reluctant to accept the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis in children, since most cases ofchronic cough turn out to have reactive airway disease or; sometimes, cystic fibrosis.",

Chest deformities include pectus carinatum, a Harrison sulcus, an increase in the AP diameter of the thorax, or abnormally 58S elevated shoulders. All of these abnormalities suggest chronic hyperinflation and poorly controlled small airway obstruction. The presence of a barrel chest at 10 or 14 years of age has been shown to beassociated with a poor prognosis. 39 The diagnosis of asthma can be aided and should be confirmed by pulmonary function tests. 40 These tests inciude spirometric assessments of forced expiratory air flow, flowvolume loops, and measurements of lung volumes, airway resistance, and conductance. When there is doubt about the existence of reactive airway disease, bronchial challenge tests may also be indicated. For the older child (>6 to 7 years), the tests are basically the same as those performed in adults. For the preschool child, modifications of standard tests have been developed. They include partial flow-volume curves, body plethysmographic evaluations of the functional residual capacity and airway resistance, and measurements of respiratory system resistance by forced oscillation. In the office and the clinic, peak flow meters are very useful, and good results can often be obtained in 4-and 5-year-olds. Performing the pulmonary function tests in the young child require some cooperation; therefore, training is recommended, and experienced, friendly, motivated technologists are needed to obtain optimal results. We should also remember that arterial blood gas measurements are important measures of ventilation/perfusion relationships and thus of lung function. Assessments of lung functions before and after bronchodilator adminiStration are extremely valuable for initial and follow-up evaluations, since they are the best means of assessing objectively and in quantitative terms the severity, reversibility, and progression of airway obstruction. The aim of therapy in children with asthma is to normalize lung function as much as possible without causing undesirable side effects from drug therapy.",

Theophylline blood levels should be assessed whenever there are signs of toxicity or failure of a good response at reasonable doses. For the management of acute bronchospasm, we use repeated inhaiations of PI-adrenergic agonists or injected terbutaline. Both forms of therapy can be given at home by appropriately trained caretakers. I favor injected terbutaline over epinephrine because of less tachycardia, pallor, and excitement and more prolonged bronchodilation following terbutaline injections. When there are frequent recurrences of bronchospastic attacks, when a chronic cough is believed to be due to reactive airway disease, or when a child's small airway obstruction does not resolve, long-term therapy with inhaled and oral bronchodilators or cromolyn should be considered.

SUMMARY Asthma in children has many special features which deserve consideration. This disease is probably underdiagnosed and is often undertreated. Vague, persistent respiratory symptoms, especially chronic cough, may often be due to asthma. Chronic bronchitis is extremely rare in the pediatric patient and is a manifestation of reactive airway disease or cystic fibrosis. The absolute severity, the extent of the disease, responses to treatment, and long-term course should be evaluated by repeated pulmonary function tests. Fortunately, asthma responds well to pharmacologic and supportive therapy, and it is important to approach its management as that of a chronic rather than episodic illness. Therapy should include comprehensive, closely supervised drug therapy, health education, and a program of selfmanagement. Asthma usually starts before youngsters enter school, and the majority get better as they get older: Nevertheless, many children with moderate or severe asthma will continue to be troubled by intermittent or chronic airwayobstruction into adulthood, and they require long-term, anticipatory treatment programs. Comprehensive care will optimize the quality of life for the affected children and their families, and it will minimize the discomfort and resbictions to which some of them have been subjected unnecessarily. Asthma in childhood, especially when not well controlled, may constitute a risk factor for the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adulthood; however; this is as yet only suspected and not proved.\" I mmunotherapy has long been employed in an attempt to block the allergic response of man to inhaled allergens. Although demonstrably successful in some specific clinical situations, its place in the overall management ofasthma is to some extent controversial, and proper use depends on a detailed knowledge of indications, techniques of administration, and potential untoward effects. Formerly called \"desensitization\" or \"hyposensitization,\" immunotherapy attempts to alter the balance of immunologic reactions to ordinarily harmless atmospheric \"allergens\" in a fashion that will minimize the response of the allergic person's airways upon reexposure to the allergen. 1 As immunologic reactions are highly specific, use of the method presupposes that accurate diagnosis of the offending allergens has been arrived at and that materials (extracts)containing the essential allergens are available for immunization. Successful immunization may also improve the nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity which characterizes asthma.",

With the availability of long-acting, slow-release preparations, suicides have been attempted, especially by teenaged girls. Overdoses and toxicity must be treated aggressively, including gastric lavage, gastric administration of charcoal, and charcoal hemoperfusion. Mild theophylline toxicity can beprecipitated without a change in theophylline dosing by the simultaneous use of cimetidine, erythromycin, and other antibiotics in the macrolide group. Changes in diet during acute and viralinfections may alter the rate at which theophylline is broken down, and alterations in airway reactivity have been observed following influenza vaccination. 45 \u2022 48",
