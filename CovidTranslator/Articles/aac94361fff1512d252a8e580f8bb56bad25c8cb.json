As of March 20, 2020, a total of 260,476 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed and 11,289 deaths. Transmission of COVID-19 is community-based unlike previous coronavirus outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) or the Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) that were both mainly transmitted in the hospital setting 1,2 . Recent reports show that patients infected with COVID-19 are at high risk for severe morbidity (5% intensive care unit admissions) and mortality (1.4%) 3 , although highly dependent on age and prior comorbidity 4 . The reproduction number (R0), which defines the average number of cases directly generated by one case, for COVID-19 is estimated to be between 1.5-3.5 5,6 and the reproduction efficacy may be influenced by cultural habits, population density and the country specific mitigation methods such as quarantine strategies as well as travel control measures [7] [8] [9] . An additional key factor that is of specific interest world-wide and a source for controversy is the effect of the climate on COVID-19 transmission 10 .",

Currently, the World Health Organization assumption is that COVID-19 spread will not be ameliorated during the summer period 17 . A surveillance tool assessing the correlation between the spread rate of COVID-19 and climate variables will be instrumental for societies, governments and health organizations worldwide. Analyzing the interaction between disease spread rate and climate may allow implementation of differential and precise mitigation measures for disease spread prevention, to tune healthcare routine ambulatory services and preparation strategies and to minimize the unnecessary dreadful impact of excessive quarantine strategies on psychosocial health and economies. Online dashboards have proven useful for global COVID-19 tracking. We have two aims in the current study. First, to compare the distinctive transmission efficacy of COVID-19 in countries with cold and warm climate based on the initial disease diagnosis trends worldwide. We consider this to be a cautious test case for examining the correlation between climate and COVID-19 disease spread. The second and more important aim, is to create an online up-to-date surveillance tool simultaneously presenting COVID-19 spread rate with relation to climate parameters.",

A preliminary clue for a possible association between temperature and COVID-19 was reported online from Bannister-Tyrrell et al. 27 Our results in the current study may strengthen the rationale to further assess the association between climate parameters and COVID-19 outbreak spread rate.

Moreover, we chose to look at data beyond patient 30 (for countries and USA states), further ensuring that the diagnosed cases are from local spread. We demonstrated that average temperature as well as dew point, were negatively correlated with the RR and RoS in the worldwide analysis. Twenty four countries were included in our analysis which aids in generalizing these findings worldwide as the pandemic rages on. In addition, we demonstrated that potential confounders such as the population size, the number of tests and the number of tests/1000 persons did not significantly correlate with RR or RoS.

Different mitigation steps were undertaken by each included country during different times affecting the spread of COVID 19 in ways we cannot account for. However, since these mitigation steps have a lag period of approximately14 days (based on the virus incubation time) they may only marginally affect our analysis. Also, as most of our \"cold\" climate countries are located in Europe, it important to note that ground travel within the European Union was unrestricted until very recently, a variable which may increase the imported spread rate. The lack of standardized criteria for diagnostic testing for COVID-19 between countries affects the incidence and cumulative count. Be that as it may, number of tests performed in each country did not correlate with the RR and RoS. We used the climate parameters of the capital city of each country (and state in the USA) to represent each country in its entirety in order to calculate the RR and RoS as more detailed locations of COVID-19 diagnoses in each country were not available to us, thus local spread within the country was not accounted for .

Further research and update of the surveillance tool will allow tracing these dynamic trends in relation with real-time temperature and the appropriate time lag consistent with COVID-19 incubation period. Finally, our results might further be confounded by the varied socioeconomic status of the participating countries as well as social context. COVID-19 RR and RoS are affected by a multitude of factors. As the pandemic is spreading across the world with an alarmingly increasing toll of diagnosed cases as well as deaths, our findings of decreased RR and RoS in warm climates may suggest that the inevitable seasonal variance will alter the dynamic of the disease spread in both hemispheres in the coming months. However, we warrant a cautious interpretation of these findings given the fact that we are in the initial steps of this outbreak in many \"warm\" climate countries, the high variance of the data and the dynamic changes in the disease surveillance and the lack of correlation based on the limited data in the US. The current evidence from our study, does not justify any modification of governmental mitigation strategies in countries with warm climates.

The choice of 30 for the point we start counting diagnosed cases was chosen as a cut-off based on 2 standard deviations from the mean diagnosed patients in countries with imported cases only (based on WHO situation report at March 5, 2020) We calculated the slope of a sliding window of size (dT), where we chose dT=3.

The data presented was analyzed according to the data available via CSSE as of March 19, 2020. The cumulative number of cases in a logarithmic scale is shown in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1. In order to quantify the disease spread, the replication rate (the slope of the logarithmic graph smoothened for a period of 3 days) was calculated for each country (Figure 2) as well as the rate of spread the slope of the linear regression calculated for a period of 7 days (Figure 3). Mean replication rate (RR averaged over all time windows available for each country) was significantly lower in \"warm\" climate countries (0.12 \u00b1 0.02) compared with \"cold\" countries (0.24 \u00b1 0.01), (p<0.0001).

Given the robust outbreak in Italy, most probably due to non-climate factors, we examined the discussed climate-RR/RoS correlations without the data of Italy. The correlation of RR with temperature and dew point in the dataset excluding Italy was R=-0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.87 to -0.35; P=0.001 and R=-0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.84 to -0.17 (P=0.02). The correlations of RoS to temperature and dew point remained significant as well. Therefore, we conclude that the correlations described above were unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of Italy in the analysis. Furthermore, to exclude an effect of our pre-selected climate classification to \"warm\" and \"cold\" on the correlation between RR/RoS to climate parameters we also examined the correlation after we added countries that fulfilled our non-climate dependent criteria (USA, Japan, Greece and South Korea). Both RR and RoS significantly correlated with temperature (RR: R=-0.64, P<0.001; ROS: R=-0.67, P<0.001) and dew point (RR: R=-0.60, P=0.002; RoS: R=-0.63, P=0.001) and did not correlate with other climate parameters (similar to the correlation pattern described above without these additional countries).",

Dew point temperature was previously shown to strongly associate with respiratory viruses spread rate and was recently found to explain approximately one third of the variation in transmission of enteroviruses across USA22,23 . The dew point depends on both temperature and humidity and it is defined as the temperature to which air must be cooled at constant pressure for saturation to occur. Dew point may influence evaporation of aerosols containing COVID-19.Doubling time in our assessment was only marginally different between warm and cold countries, due to the high variance in RoS in warm countries.Animal studies have suggested much lower transmission rates of influenza virus in high humidity and/or high temperature conditions 24 .Our findings of lower RR and RoS in warm climate may suggest that the seasonal climate variation will influence disease spread dynamics globally in the coming months. Colder temperatures may provide better conditions for virus survival outside the human body, with longer viral viability on contaminated surfaces and fomites. The SARS-CoV survives longer in colder and less humid conditions on contaminated All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",
