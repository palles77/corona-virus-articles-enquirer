The Class II ARFs arose late in animal cell evolution, possibly in metazoans, but Class I ARFs are highly conserved and are present in all eukaryotes examined to date. Hence, in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, each class has a single ARF orthologue, but yeast lacks the Class II ARFs.

A distinguishing feature of ARF family G proteins is the presence of an N-terminal amphipathic helix that is critical for membrane binding (FIG. 1a,b ). In addition, all ARF proteins are modified by myristoylation at the N terminus and this co-translational modification is required for membrane recruitment and biological activity. The myristoyl group and associated N-terminal amphipathic helix are inserted into the membrane upon GTP binding 3 . Thus, in addition to changes in the effector-binding regions upon exchange of GDP for GTP, ARF proteins undergo a second change in conformation that brings them into very close contact with the membrane 4 (FIG. 1) . This distinguishes them from other small G proteins of the Ras superfamily, including the Ras, Rho and Rab families, which have a long carboxy-terminal linker to which their lipid membrane anchor is attached 2 . ARF effectors are thus constrained to a position close to the membrane surface, in contrast to those of Rab and Rho, which can be located some distance from the membrane 2 . Some ARL proteins are myristoylated but most seem to lack this modification. In ARL8B, loss of hydrophobic residues in the amphipathic helix abolishes lysosomal localization 5 . Interestingly, ARFRP1 (Arl3 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), ARL8A and ARL8B are acetylated rather than myristoylated at their N terminus 2 . In SAR1, the N-terminal amphipathic helix binds directly to membrane s and induces membrane curvature 6 . Unlike for Rab and Rho G proteins, no GDP dissociation inhibitor (GDI) proteins have been identified for ARFs or ARLs. ARF1 and ARF3 appear to be released from membranes on GTP hydrolysis in cells. ARF6, however, remains bound to membranes in its GDP-bound conformation, and there is evidence that ARF4 and ARF5 remain bound to ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) membranes in their GDP-bound form 7, 8 . This raises the possibility that ARF proteins that are bound to membranes in their GDP-bound form might interact with membrane-localized partners and mediate signalling. Evidence for this idea is emerging for ARF6 (see below), and suggests that distinct signalling pathways might be coordinated through the nucleotide state of these constitutively membrane-bound ARF family proteins. SAR1 and some of the ARLs, such as ARL1, ARL4 and ARL8, are cytosolic when GDP-bound, similarly to ARF1 (REFS 2, 9) , and it remains to be determined whether this is true for other ARL proteins.",

These various coat proteins specifically bind cargo proteins and incorporate them into newly forming vesicles for sorting and transport to their correct destinations. ARFs can also recruit and activate enzymes that alter membrane lipid composition. Phospholipase D (PLD), which hydrolyses phosphatidylcholine to generate phosphatidic acid, is activated by all ARF proteins and also by ARL1 (REF. 13 ). All ARF proteins can both recruit and activate PtdIns-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdIns4P5K), an enzyme that phosphorylates PtdIns4P at the 5-position to generate PtdIns-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5) P 2 ) 1 . For example, ARF6 at the cell periphery directly affects the activity of PtdIns4P5K at the plasma membrane, and thus regulates PtdIns(4,5)P 2 levels there 1 . At the Golgi, ARF1 recruits and stimulates the activity of PtdIns 4-kinase (PtdIns4K), forming PtdIns4P, which is an important membrane lipid for Golgi function 14 . ARF1 also binds to PtdIns4P-specific pleckstrin homology (PH) domains contained in a family of oxysterolbinding proteins that are believed to function in lipid homeo stasis at the Golgi 14 .",

For example, ARF1 and ARF4 act redundantly during transport in the early secretory pathway 15 . Consistent with this observation, ARF4 localizes to the ERGIC and cis-Golgi 8 and, together with ARF1 at the cis-Golgi, it organizes traffickin g between these compartments 16 .",

In an elegant series of studies, ARF4 was found to specifically recognize the VXPX cytosolic targeting motif in retinal rhodopsin to facilitate its transport into the rod outer segment, which is a specialized cilium 19 (FIG. 2b) . This ciliary targeting complex includes, in addition to ARF4, Rab11, FIP3 (a shared ARF and Rab11 effector) and ASAP1 (ARF GAP containing SH3, ankyrin repeat and PH domains 1) 20 . Exactly how this complex facilitates the packaging of rhodopsin into post-Golgi carriers has yet to be determined but, interestingly, rhodopsin itself initiates complex formation by recruiting ARF4. The rhodopsin-binding site on ARF4 is in the \u03b13 helix 19 , the same region that in ARF1 binds the SNARE protein membrin (also known as GOSR2) to mediate targeting to the early Golgi 17 ; thus, this region might generally allow ARF protein binding to membrane receptors. ARF4 and ARF5 can also directly bind to CAPS (calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion), which regulates exocytosis of dense core vesicles from nerve terminals 21 . It is the GDP-bound form of the ARF that binds to the PH domains of CAPS proteins, and knockdown of CAPS, ARF4 or ARF5 causes retention of chromagrannin (a marker for dense core vesicles) in the Golgi, suggesting that ARF4 and ARF5, together with CAPS, regulate the release of dense core vesicles from the Golgi (FIG. 2a) .

Depletion of T. brucei ARF1 by small interfering RNA causes a major decrease in endocytosis and the formation of intracellular flagella, but the Golgi remains intact 136 . Trypanosomes also express an ARF-like 2 (ARL2) homologue, which is involved in microtubule biogenesis and cytokinesis 137 , and an ARL1 homologue, which is important for Golgi structure and exocytosis of glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins 138 . ARF and ARL proteins in trypanosomes are myristoylated, a modification that is required for their activity. Trypanosomes cause African sleeping sickness, a disease with no successful therapy. A selective inhibitor of trypanosomal N-myristoyl transferase has been shown to be effective in blocking trypanosome viability in a mouse model of this disease 139 . with findings of ARF4 localization to, and ARF4 and ARF5 functioning at, the early Golgi in other cells 8, 15, 16 is not known.

At the Golgi, ARF1 recruits the lipid transfer proteins ceramide transfer (CERT) and FAPP2 (REF. 14) through interaction with their PH domains, which can also bind PtdIns4P. CERT mediates the non-vesicular transport of ceramide from the ER to the Golgi and FAPP2 mediates the transfer of glucosylceramide from the cytosolic side of the early Golgi to the trans-Golgi 22 . Exactly how the directionality of this transfer occurs, and the role that ARF1 has, is not yet clear. The finding that ARF1 associates with GBF1 and COPI during lipid droplet formation was un expected. These proteins were identified in an RNAi screen of lipid droplet formation in D. melanogaster 23 and also appeared in proteomic analyses of lipid droplets along with other trafficking proteins, which led to the idea that lipid droplets interface with multiple membrane trafficking pathways 24 . In particular, the delivery of two proteins, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP; also known as adipophilin), to the surface of lipid droplets requires ARF1, GBF1 and COPI, and possibly the COPII machinery, in mammalian cells 25 ; similar results were obtained in D. melanogaster S2 cells 26 . Another ARF family membe r, ARFRP1, is highly expressed in adipocytes, and mice that lack ARFRP1 in adipose tissue show severe defects in lipid storage and enhanced lipolysis 27 . Finally, in some cell types ARF1 at the plasma membrane affects endocytosis of proteins anchored to the membrane by a glyco syl PtdIns (GPI) linkage 28 . This may also require the ARF GEF GBF1 (REF. 29) and could be related to the other lipid-regulating functions of ARF1.",

In mammals, ARF6 is not required for early embryonic development, but ARF6-knockout mice die at and ARF4 localize to the early cis-Golgi and ARF3 specifically localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN). In addition to the recruitment of coat proteins (coatomer complex I (COPI), GGA (Golgi-localized, \u03b3-ear-containing, ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein) and adaptor protein 1 (AP1)) to the Golgi, ARF1 binds to ceramide transfer (CERT) and FAPP2 to mediate the transport of ceramide and glucosylceramide lipids from the cis-Golgi to the trans-Golgi. At the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC), ARF1 and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) GBF1 act with COPII to regulate the formation of lipid droplets and for the replication of several viruses. CAPS (Calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion), which is involved in regulated secretion, is recruited to the TGN by ARF4 and ARF5. At the ER, SAR1, activated by SEC12, recruits COPII to allow vesicle transport to the Golgi. b | In retinal cells, ARF4 binds specifically to rhodopsin in the TGN membrane and, together with FIP3, ASAP (ARF GAP containing SH3, ankyrin repeat and PH domains) and Rab11, it facilitates the transport of rhodopsin in transport vesicles from the inner segment to the outer segment, which is a specialized cilium. ARF-like 3 (ARL3) has been found to be localized to the connecting cilium, and retinitis pigmentosa 2 (RP2; also known as XRP2), an ARL3 GAP, localizes to the TGN, the basal body and the membrane adjacent to the connecting cilium. c | In primary cilia, ARL6 recruits the BBSome coat complex that facilitates the transport of membrane proteins into the cilium.

At the plasma membrane, ARF6 changes the membrane lipid composition through activation of PtdIns4P5K and PLD, resulting in the generation of PtdIns(4,5)P 2 and phosphatidic acid. These lipids are important for sorting proteins within the membrane, for the formation of clathrin-coated pits during endocytosis, and for the recruitment and activation of Rho family G proteins, such as Rac, to alter actin poly merization. There is some evidence that ARF6 can interact with AP2 (REF. 31) and clathrin during G proteincoupled receptor (GPCR) cell signalling 32 . A recent study has found that ARF6 enters cells in clathrin-coated vesicles to facilitate the rapid recycling of the transferrin receptor back to the plasma membrane through interaction with the microtubule motor adaptor protein JNKinteracting protein 4 (JIP4) after clathrin uncoating 33 . In some cells, ARF6 associates with endosomal membranes derived from clathrin-independent forms of endo cytosis and mediates recycling of this membrane back to the plasma membrane 34 . Recycling endosomes return membrane proteins that are important for cell adhesion and migration back to the plasma membrane 34, 35 . ARF6 regulation of such endosomal membrane trafficking is required for the polarized delivery of CDC42, Rac and the PAR6 complex to the leading edge of migratin g cells 36 , which can alter adhesion to the extracellular matrix through focal adhesions and actin-based protrusions.

During adherens junction formation, PAR3 recruits a scaffolding protein, FRMD4A, that binds to cytohesin GEFs, which leads to activation of ARF6 (REF. 44 ). Treatment of fully polarized epithelial cells with hepatocyte growth factor leads to activation of ARF6, most likely through the ARF GEF BRAG2 (REF. 45 ), and activation of Rac, which causes disassembly of adherens junctions by stimulating endocytosis of epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) 1 . Hence, depending on the signalling complex assembled, either formation or dis assembly of adherens junctions can be achieved through activation of ARF6. There is also some evidence that the ARF6 GEF EFA6 affects tight-junction assembly 46 . ARF6 activation has also been reported at the onset of tubulogenesis (a developmental progression from polarized epithelia to tubular structures), and perturbation of the ARF6 GTP-GDP cycle inhibits tubule formation 47 .",

ARF6\u2022GDP binds several TBC (Tre2-Bub2-Cdc16) domain-containing proteins, which often have Rab GAP activity 48 . ARF6\u2022GDP binds both TBC1 domain family member 24 (TBC1D24; a protein mutated in familial infantile myoclonic epilepsy 49 ) and the TRE17 oncogene 50 . TRE17 binding to ARF6 increases its activation 50 ; although TRE17 does not itself have GEF activity towards ARF6, it may facilitate interaction of ARF6 with another GEF. ARF6\u2022GDP also binds to the Kalirin family of Rho GEFs, through their spectrin-like repeat domain 51 , and recruits Kalirin to the membrane, where it subsequently activates Rac and RhoG to regulate actin dynamics 51 (FIG. 3) . Hence, ARF6\u2022GDP and ARF6\u2022GTP both interact with regulatory proteins of other small G proteins, allowing alternative signalling pathways to be activated depending on which nucleotide is bound (FIG. 1c) . This raises the intriguing possibility that other GDP-bound ARF or ARL proteins might also bind unique effector proteins.",

Cilia are vital for cell signalling and differentiation, and their impaired formation is responsible for many genetic disorders 62 . Bardet-Biedl syndrome is a complex genetic disease that can be caused by mutation in any one of 14 genes associated with ciliogenesis. Transport of membrane proteins into the cilium is driven by a complex of proteins, called the BBSome. BBSome subunits have 'coat-like' attributes and simila r structural folds to those found in COPI and adaptor protein complexes, suggesting that the BBSome can sort specific cargo for transport (FIG. 2c) . ARL6 is a BBS subunit (BBS3) and is required in its GTP-bound form to recruit the BBSome onto the plasma membrane to drive cargo sorting into cilia 63 . Structural and biochemical analyses have shown that one of the mutations in ARL6 that causes Bardet-Biedl syndrome, T31R, leads to a non-functional ARL6 that cannot bind GTP 64 . This supports the idea that ARL6 recruits the BBSome complex to membranes for formation of BBSome-coated vesicles. ARL13 is mutated in patients with Joubert syndrome, which is a rare, complex cerebral disorder that is characterized by developmental delays and cognitive dis ability. It is also involved in intraflagellar transport (FIG. 2c) and, in C. elegans, ARL-13 associates with the doublet segment of the cilium and its loss results in shortened cilia 65, 66 .",

Because GEFs ensure the precise temporal and spatial activation of ARFs, their own localization mechanisms are crucial for understanding their cellular roles. These mechanisms are turning out to be quite complex, even for the simplest of the ARF GEFs, the members of the cytohesin (also known as ARNO) family. Membrane trafficking is crucial to numerous developmental and physiological processes, and the specific functions of different ARF GEFs in these pathways and their links to disease are now being revealed.",

However, Rab1 (REF. 77) and PtdIns4P generated by PtdIns4KIII\u03b1 78 are involved in recruitment of GBF1 to membranes. Other close connections between Golgi ARFs and PtdIns4P have emerged recently. In yeast there is an interesting synergy observed between the ARF1 GEF Gea2 and PtdIns4P produced by Pik1 (the yeast homologue of PtdIns4KIII\u03b2).

Cells expressing constitutively active ARF6Q67L have increased levels of ARF1\u2022GTP 89 . ARF1 affects several processes at the plasma membrane, including recruitment of proteins to focal adhesions and during phagocytosis. In the forming phagocytic cup, ARF6\u2022GTP is recruited earlier than ARF1\u2022GTP, at a stage that requires rapid insertion of new membrane 94 . Hence, the ARF6-cytohesin-ARF1 cascade might ensure a high level of activated ARF protein here. ARF6 is less abundant than ARF1 in cells, and as both ARF1 and ARF6 can recruit effectors such as PtdIns4P5K and PLD, processes requiring acute activation of such effectors may rely on the more abundant ARF1 to provide an adequate supply. In support of this idea, both ARF1 and ARF6, through cytohesins, contribute to activation of PtdIns4P5K and PLD in the insulin signalling pathway 95 . In addition to ARF6-cytohesin-ARF1 or possible ARL4-cytohesin-ARF6 cascades, there is a conserved ARL cascade, in which yeast ARL3\u2022GTP recruits ARL1 to TGN membranes 2 . In this case, it is not known whether an ARL GEF is involved. Hence, ARF family cascades could be common and could explain the Golgi ARFs that act in pairs.",

They regulate insulin signalling by binding CNK1, a scaffolding molecule that is important for Ras, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and AKT signalling 95 . CNK1 recruits cytohesins in an insulin-dependent manner to the plasma membrane, where they generate a PtdIns(4,5)P 2enriched micro domain that is essential for PI3K-AKT activation. Other scaffolding proteins interact with the coiled-coil domain of cytohesin; these proteins include Golgi reassembly-stacking protein (GRASP) and IPCEF (interactor protein for cytohesin exchange factor s), which mediate the interaction of DOCK180 with cytohesin 99 . Interestingly, assembly of this scaffolding complex promotes Rac activation and cell migration, indicating that these scaffolds assemble a signalling complex that determines a specific downstream output upon ARF activation 99 .

ASAP1 resides in focal adhesions but, in response to SRC activation, it facilitates formation of podosomes 112 , which are discrete actin-based structures that are formed at the cell substratum to degrade matrix. The crystal structure of ARF6 in complex with the catalytic domain of ASAP3 revealed that a catalytic Arg-finger of ASAP3 is responsible for GTP hydrolysis 113 , similarly to many other GAPs, a finding that is consistent with an earlier structure of the GAP domain of ASAP2 (REF. 114 ). There is also some evidence that calcium might bind to the complex and regulate GAP activity 113 , although this needs to be confirmed with full-length ASAP3 and ARF6 and in cells. The ASAPs all have N-terminal BAR domains that can induce membrane curvature and tubule formation in transfected cells and in cell-free systems. The BAR domain in ASAP1 negatively regulates its GAP activity towards ARF1 (REF. 115) , and binding of the Rab11 effector FIP3 to the BAR domain of ASAP1 stimulates its GAP activity 116 . As mentioned earlier, ASAP1 also promotes ciliary targeting together with ARF4 and FIP3 (REF. 20) (FIG. 2b) . ASAP1 is upregulated in breast, pancreatic and colorectal cancer 58 . CBL-interacting protein 85 (CIN85; also known as SH3KBP1) binds to ASAP1, recruiting the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBL, to trigger the mono ubiquitylation of ASAP1; this modification is important for invasion of breast cancer cells 117 but the role for ubiquitylation of ASAP in cell invasion is not known. One caveat to observations made when ASAP is expressed in cells is that a study designed to systematically look at ARF GAP function and ARF specificity failed to detect an effect of ASAP1 expression on either ARF1\u2022GTP or ARF6\u2022GTP levels in cells 118 . This raises the possibility that the GAP activity of ASAP1 might not always be critical for some of ASAP1's specific functions.",

            "text": "The ARF GAP GIT1, originally identified as a GPCR kinase-interacting protein, can coordinate signalling by acting as a scaffold. GIT1 and its substrate ARF6 affect ligand-stimulated endocytosis of several GPCRs through either clathrin-dependent or clathrin-independent endocytic pathways 119 . Among the proteins interacting with GIT1 are the CDC42 and Rac GEF PIX, focal adhesion kinase and paxillin. GIT1, similarly to ASAP1, is sometimes observed in focal adhesions and its influence on the activation of CDC42 and Rac suggests that ARF inactivation and Rac activation are coordinated (FIG. 3) . D. melanogaster GIT is required for muscle morphogenesis 120 and the GIT1-knockout mouse is defective in fear learning 121 and dendritic spine formation 122 . Rac3 interacts with GIT1, disrupting GIT1 binding to paxillin; this in turn stimulates GIT1 GAP activity, presumably towards ARF6 (REF. 123 ), and inhibits cell spreading and neuritogenesis. In endothelial cells, ROBO4 interacts with paxillin, which recruits GIT1 to inactivate ARF6, and this leads to vascular stability, blocking cellular protrusions and neovascular leak 55 . Thus, these examples provide insights into how modular ARF GAPs promote spatially and temporally restricted assembly of signalling complexes, and allow a precise physiological output in response to a signal. Intracellular pathogens can use a fascinating GAPblocking mechanism to rewire the host cell's signalling network for their own purposes. Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli produce the EspG protein, which binds to GTP-bound ARF1 and ARF6, blocking their access to GAPs and disrupting the function of both early Golgi and recycling endosomes 124 . Moreover, EspG simultaneously binds to p21-activated kinase (PAK), an effector of a distinct G protein family member, CDC42, and promotes PAK localization at Golgi membranes rather than at the plasma membrane. This raises the possibility that EspG assembles its own signalling complex on intra cellular membranes to subvert membrane trafficking and polarit y processes in host cells.",

            "text": "Conclusions & perspectives ARF activity is regulated in a spatiotemporal manner by the GEFs and GAPs, underlining the importance of precise localization of these regulators. In the case of cytohesins, such specificity can be achieved through a coincidence-detection mechanism, requiring both an activating ARF or ARL protein and a specific lipid composition. This example also reveals the existence of ARF family activation cascades and how relief of autoinhibition can be coupled to precise spatial cues. It will be interesting to see how widespread these mechanisms are among ARF family members. ARF cascades, similarly to those demonstrated for Rab G proteins, could transform one membrane domain into another during highly dynamic membrane trafficking. These transformations involve coordinated changes in the lipid and protein composition of each membrane domain, a specialty of many ARF family members, which recruit both lipidmodifying enzymes and protein effectors such as coats and tethers. The signature feature of ARF family proteins, their N-terminal membrane-binding amphipathic helix, ensures that they are closely associated with the lipid bilayer in their GTP-bound form. Future studies on how ARF family proteins function will therefore require in vitro reconstitution on model membranes. There appears to be a particularly important link between ARF1 function and PtdIns4P, a lipid that has a central role in the function of the Golgi, which parallels the coordination of membrane trafficking and PtdIns(4,5) P 2 signalling by ARF6 at the plasma membrane.",

These networks include cytoskeleton regulators, and it appears that some ARL proteins (ARL2, for example) have evolved exclusively to regulate the cytoskeleton. The role of ARF6 in networks linking membrane trafficking to the actin cytoskeleton also involves interaction of ARF6 with GEFs and GAPs of the Rac and Rho small G proteins, actin cytoskeleton regulators. Another emerging concept is that some ARF family members remain membrane-bound in their GDP-bound form so that they can interact with signalling complexes and promote alternative signalling pathways. Ultimately, these ARF family signalling networks will need to be studied through systems level analysis.",
