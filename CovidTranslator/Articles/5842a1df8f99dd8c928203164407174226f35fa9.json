Since then, several animal models have been developed for the study of SARS and, although no model replicates the human disease in all aspects, the use of animal models for SARS has led to the establishment of several important principles for vaccine and immunotherapy. Consistency and reproducibility of findings in a given model must be demonstrated to establish the superiority of one model over others. Here, we suggest aspects of an ideal animal model for studies of SARS pathogenesis and vaccine development and present our assessment of the strengths and limitations of the current animal models for SARS.",

Although it is difficult to predict whether another outbreak of SARS will occur, exposure to infected animals and laboratory-acquired infections that are not immediately recognized are two potential sources for infections. The high morbidity and mortality rate and economic consequences of the 2003 outbreak, together with the potential for infections in the future, are reasons for continued global interest in the development of measures to prevent and control SARS. Antiviral drugs, immunotherapy and vaccines against SARS will have to be evaluated in animal models, and a rational selection of an appropriate model for these studies will depend on a careful assessment and review of available models. We summarize the findings in the current animal models for SARS and discuss what we have learned from these models. The utility, benefits, limitations and controversy surrounding these models are also discussed. Furthermore, we suggest directions for future research that will facilitate the resolution of controversial findings, and we present some of the outstanding research questions in the field.",

Efforts to develop animal models were undertaken in several laboratories around the world and experimental infection in these different animal models has proven to be invaluable in establishing the basis for prevention and control strategies for SARS. However, published reports from laboratories that have used different animal models have led to some controversial opinions and misunderstandings about animal models for SARS. It is essential that the findings in a given model are consistent and reproducible and that these features are well documented.",

Consistency, reproducibility and the relevance of the outcome measures to the scientific question (such as immunogenicity and efficacy of vaccines or pathogenesis of disease) must be considered before one can conclude that a given model is superior to other available models and is the preferred or appropriate model. Clearly, the pathogenesis of disease can only be studied in animal models that replicate key aspects of the disease. But animal models do not need to replicate all aspects of disease to provide useful information in evaluation of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis. For example, an animal model can be useful in vaccine efficacy studies if the following two criteria are met: (i) virus titer correlates with disease severity; and (ii) the virus replicates in the animal model to a sufficiently high titer so that differences in the level of replication between immunized and mock-immunized control groups can be meaningfully distinguished. Under these conditions, demonstration that a vaccine or antibody can prevent or significantly reduce the level of replication of challenge virus would be convincing evidence of efficacy. There is ample precedence for this approach in the development of vaccines against other respiratory viruses.",

Infection is not accompanied by overt clinical illness and the virus is cleared seven to ten days pi. As in mice, SARS-CoV infection of golden Syrian hamsters elicits a robust neutralizing antibody response and previously infected hamsters are protected from subsequent infection [24] . A correlation between the level of virus recovered from the lungs and the extent of pneumonitis has been demonstrated in SARS-CoV infected hamsters [25] . The fact that SARS-CoV reproducibly replicates to extremely high titer in the respiratory tract of hamsters with associated pneumonitis makes this an excellent model for the evaluation of vaccines, immunoprophylaxis and immunotherapy for SARS [24, 25] .",

Unfortunately, reports on clinical illness in cynomolgus and rhesus macaques from the various groups are contradictory. Clearly there are several factors that can contribute to the differences in findings by different investigators, including age and source of the animals, their environmental history and possible presence of co-pathogens, and the dose, route of inoculation and strain of virus administered. However, when findings are not reproducible in outbred species that demonstrate biological variability, it becomes particularly important that studies are carried out in large sample sizes to draw meaningful conclusions. The difficulty in conducting studies in non-human primates with large sample size limits their utility as an ideal animal model.",

            "text": "We have learned much about correlates of immunity using the current animal models for SARS research. Experiments in mice with targeted defects in the immune system suggest that innate immunity has an important role in clearance of SARS-CoV [10, 11] . Additional studies have shown that intranasally administered SARS-CoV replicates in the respiratory tract of several animal species and protects animals from re-infection with SARS-CoV [8, 24, 35] . In addition to primary infection, active immunization with inactivated whole virus vaccines, DNA vaccines, subunit vaccines and live, vectored vaccines expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein also elicit neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV that provide protection from subsequent challenge (Table 2) . Furthermore, passive transfer of post-infection or post-immunization sera or monoclonal antibodies against the spike protein can also protect mice, ferrets and hamsters from infection, and modulate disease (Table 2) . Moreover, depletion of T-cells in mice immunized with a DNA vaccine encoding the spike protein gene did not abrogate protection from SARS-CoV challenge, and adoptive transfer of T-cells from immunized mice to na\u00efve mice did not confer protection from SARS-CoV challenge. These findings strongly suggest that vaccines that elicit humoral immunity to SARS-CoV spike protein or immunotherapy that targets the spike protein will be sufficient to protect from SARS infection and associated disease. Research in animal models has led to the identification of correlates of immunity such as the protective ability of actively induced neutralizing antibodies [8, 13, 14, 16, 17, 23, 35, 36] or passively transferred neutralizing antibodies [8, 15, 21, 22] . These principles will provide the basis for prevention and intervention strategies in the event that SARS-CoV reappears in humans.",

Although much has been learned since the initial description of the various animal models and from subsequent studies in which vaccines or therapeutic or prophylaxis strategies were studied in different animal models, the limitations of the various models (Box 1) must also be recognized. Available data do not yet support a conclusion that there is a single preferred model for SARS in which all intervention or preventive strategies must be evaluated.",

This observation could lead to an overestimation of the importance of innate immunity over adaptive immunity in clearance of SARS-CoV and the importance of antibodies in providing protection.\u2020 Some findings, particularly clinical observations, are not reproducible in most models. \u2020 Attempts to recover infectious virus from tissues are not always successful. \u2020 None of the available models fully replicate the severe disease seen in humans.Have you contributed to an Elsevier publication?Did you know that you are entitled to a 30% discount on books?A 30% discount is available to ALL Elsevier book and journal contributors when ordering books or stand-alone CD-ROMs directly from us.To take advantage of your discount: If you are faxing your order, please enclose a copy of this page.",
