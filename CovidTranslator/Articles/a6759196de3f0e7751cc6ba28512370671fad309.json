As the nucleotide sequences of neuraminidase (NA) of stain GD-01-06 were sequenced, we predicted the \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-fold structure and the indexes of the flexible regions of secondary structure of NA with methods of the Hydrophilicity plot by Kyte-Doolittle, the Surface probability plot by Emini and the Antigenic index by Jameson-Wolf, and then screened statistically the parameters to predict B-cell epitopes by the Hierarchical cluster and the Bivariate correlation and the quartiles with SPSS 13.0. The impact of variation of amino acids in NA on its epitopes was analyzed. The predictive results were evaluated by Wu's Antigenic Index and SWISS-MODEL. We found that the most possible epitopes on NA were located within or nearby its N-terminal Nos. 120-137, 81-84, 408-415, 273-282, 429-432, 356-368, 46-55, 146-155, 341-350 and 198-209, which were the dominant regions of NA epitopes. Peptide 120-137 including the glycoprotein domain (NGT 126 -128 ) was first chosen as the B-cell epitopes on NA. NA in H 5 N 1 strain isolated after 2003 lacked in No. 53 amino acid (I), resulting in an increase in the surface flexible region of NA in GD-01-06 and an enlargement to their epitope regions (VEP 46 -48 \u2192 VEPISNTNFL 46 -55 ). Conclusively, prediction of the B-cell epitopes on the NA based on multiple parameters is useful for researches on the molecular immunology and drug screening and immuno-prophylaxis. A deletion of No. 53 amino acid (I) in NA in strain GD-01-06 might increase its antigenicity. H 5 N 1 virus, neuraminidase (NA), B-cell epitope, prediction, screening",

Neuraminidase (NA) is the main protein of influenza viron that induces the protective antibody against the virus. As a tetramer of identical subunits of 50 kD, NA cleaves terminal sialic acid from glycoconjugates, such as those on the viral glycoproteins and the surface of target cells in the respiratory tract. NA is a receptor-destroying enzyme, removing sialic acid from carbohydrate chains attached to NA, and releasing the viruses from infected cells. Antibody to NA is capable of inhibiting the infected cell from releasing the viruses. There are 1350 nucleotides encoding 449 amino acids (AA) in NA gene. We isolated strain A/Guangdong/1/2006 (GD-01-06) in March of 2006, and characterized it as the human influenza H 5 N 1 strain.

At present, there are quite a few methods to predict B-cell epitope, so the predictive results are greatly different with different methods. Bui et al.

We sequenced NA gene sequences of GD-01-06, predicted its secondary structure and screened the predictive parameters in B-cell epitopes with molecular-biological software and statistical software to promote the pathogenesis researches and drug screening and immuno-prophylaxis against avian and human H 5 N 1 strain.",

The impacts of a deletion of I 53 were as follows: (i) a characteristic change in 41-62 amino acids; (ii) a lack of \u03b2-fold (BG and BC) in 52-54 amino acids and a decrease of \u03b2-fold (BC) in 59-62 amino acids; (iii) an increase of \u03b2-turn (TC) in 51-54 amino acids and an increase of coil (CG) in 52-53 amino acids and an increase of flexible regions (FK) in 53-55 amino acids; (iv) an increase of hydrophilicity plot (HPK) from \u22120.31 to 3.49 with a mean of 0.475/per amino acid in 49-56 amino acids; (v) an increase of antigenic index (AIJ) from 6.90 to 12.15 with a mean of 0.283/per amino acid in 41-55 amino acids; (vi) an increase of surface probability plot (SPE) from 2.64 to 4.59 with a mean of 0.390/per amino acid in 50-54 amino acids. It was deduced that a deletion of I 53 of NA increased the flexible regions of surface of NA in GD-01-06.",
