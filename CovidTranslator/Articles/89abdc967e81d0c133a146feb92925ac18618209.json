As of today (1 February 2020), there have been an estimated 14,599 infected cases with a total of 305 deaths and 345 recovered involving 27 countries. 2 Online estimate of the case fatality rate is about 2% with a R 0 (basic reproductive number) value of 3-4, indicating that every positive case may give rise to further 3-4 new cases. Nearly all confirmed cases (14,422, 98.8%) are in the mainland China, with most of the remaining cases in nearby countries or cities in East Asia (Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Macau), Southeast Asia (Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam) and Australia accounting for the majority of the remaining cases. 2 We would like to shed light on how the epidemic will develop in Hong Kong based on the characteristics of current cases in this region.",

At present, 3/14 (21.4%) cases are in the intensive care unit (ICU) whereas the other 11 cases are clinically stable at PMH.

The period over which these cases were detected (23 January to 1 February 2020) includes the week before and the week after the CNY (starting from 25 January 2020). Does this suggest that this period represents the highest incidence of cases developing in Hong Kong because the highest intensity of population movement occurs over CNY, and that this may be expected to decrease once the celebrations are over? Not necessarily, we think, as many of the normal CNY activities in Hong Kong and mainland China were quite severely curtailed to limit the potential spread of this infection. 9 , 10 In which case, these incidence figures may represent more of the baseline rate of 2019-nCoV cases appearing in Hong Kong. Indeed, a closer look at Fig. 1 suggests that Hong Kong is already experiencing some degree of local inter-person transmission, as the earlier cases were associated with travel to Wuhan and other parts of mainland China, but the more recent cases involved no recent travel to these affected areas.",

A previous study indicated that the mean daily contact rate for an individual in Hong Kong could be characterized as contacting 12-13 other people (both children and adults) spread over a total of nine-hour duration, 11 so presumably reducing the number of social contacts can reduce the risk of inter-person transmission. At present, all primary and secondary schools are closed in Hong Kong, and the universities are either postponing classes until March 2020 or are using distant/remote learning methods. 12 Another approach is https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinf.2020.02.002 0163-4453/\u00a9 2020 The British Infection Association.
