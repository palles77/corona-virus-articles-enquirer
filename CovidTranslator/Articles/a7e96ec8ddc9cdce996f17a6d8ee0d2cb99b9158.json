Fluorescence intensities generated via the binding of phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin with biotin-labeled targets were measured by the Luminex 100 bead-based suspension array system. The bead-based suspension array detected bacteria in a significantly higher number of samples compared to the conventional culture. There was no significant difference in the detection rate of atypical pathogensatypical pathogens or viruses between the bead-based suspension array and real-time PCR.

A loop-mediated isothermal amplification system developed cooperatively by the Peking University People's Hospital and CapitalBio Corporation in China is currently being tested in clinical trials. 8 The bead-based suspension array (liquid chip) platform developed by the Luminex Corporation in the United States is a rapid, high-throughput system for multi-analyte detection. 4, 5, [8] [9] [10] [11] The system is based on polystyrene microspheres internally labeled with a unique dye combination. The microspheres are coated with thousands of copies of a probe for a specific target which is amplified from clinical samples using 5 0 -biotin-labeled primers. The fluorescent emission from the microspheres is evaluated using a 635 nm/10 inW red polar laser while a 532 nm/13 inW yttrium aluminum garnet (YAC) laser is used to measure the target analyte by exciting the streptavidin-phycoerythrin (SP-PE) fluorescent reporter bound to the surface of microspheres. 10 Target quantification is done by determining the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for each encoded microsphere by high speed computing. 12 A suspension array-based respiratory virus detection kit (xTAG RVP) developed by the Luminex corporation received FDA approval in 2008. 13, 14 This kit does not detect various common respiratory tract bacteria or atypical pathogens. Moreover, the kit has not yet been used in China, where significant variation in viruses from different geographical regions contributes to inconsistent detection sensitivity. In the present study, we aimed to utilize the bead-based suspension array technology to develop a high-throughput screening system which can detect common viruses, bacteria as well as atypical pathogens from respiratory tract infections in Chinese patients.",

[25] [26] [27] [28] The advantages of our present bead-based suspension array include: (1) the ability to simultaneously detect viruses, atypical pathogens as well as bacteria, in contrast with most current detection methods which are used to detect either only viruses or bacteria, 7,28 (2) rapid, highthroughput detection where detection of 96 samples can be completed in 7-8 h, (3) semi-quantitative detection, (4) small amounts of sample required, and (5) economy and ease of use compared to solid-phase arrays. 29 Our final annealing temperature of 58 C for target DNA amplification was higher than the annealing temperature recommended by the manufacturer. Higher annealing temperatures may cause decreased amplification efficiency, but a higher specificity. Based on the guidelines suggested by Luminex, the best capture probe lengths are 18-20 bp, and can be extended to 22-24 bp under special occasions in order to obtain stronger fluorescence signal. 30 In the present study, we used probes of around 14 to 18 bp, which would generate lower fluorescence signals for some pathogens, but would reduce non-specific signals. The shorter probe sequences used in our study resulted in a hybridization temperature lower than previously described. 31 We used a relatively longer hybridization period (60 min) to provide sufficient reaction time for interaction of probes with their target fragments, as well as for amplified target gene fragments to compete with non-specific sequences for binding with the probes.",

Fluorescence values of the same pathogen could be compared between different samples, although fluorescence values could not be compared between groups of different pathogens. The lowest concentrations that could be detected by our technology ranged from 10 0 /ml to 10 4 /ml, and detection efficiency was affected by various conditions, including amplification efficiency of primers, binding of the probe and its target sequence, hybridization temperature, the concentration of SA-PE, hybridization time, Tm of the probe, percentage of GC content in the probe, and the primer binding site on target fragments. The higher bacterial detection rates of bead-based suspension arrays compared to conventional culture in our study could be because the positivity rates of bacterial cultures are influenced by factors such as prior antibiotic use, shapes of sputum samples, and whether the samples are delivered to the lab in a timely manner. Previous results reported a high incidence of pathogenic Gram-negative bacilli in patients with acute respiratory tract infections. 32 These data were consistent with our study where the majority of bacterial strains detected (68.2%) were Gram-negative bacilli. This could be because most of the hospitalized patients in our study were older, had complications and had reported self-medication with antibiotics. The rate of virus infections detected in our study was higher than previously reported incidence rates of community-acquired pneumonia (5% to 15%). Of the viral strains found in our study, there are 24 strains of Flu-A (46.7%). This could be because our cases mostly comprised hospitalized patients during the winter-spring season who may experience seasonal influenza epidemics more frequently.",

            "text": "We found that PA and KP were the most common pathogens in patients with multiple bacterial infections. In contrast, de Roux et al. 40 reported that multiple infections were usually caused by SP and other bacteria. This difference might be ascribed to our use of SP-sensitive antibiotics before the sample collection. Our results also showed that 17.4% of patients had infections with two viruses, higher than previously reported by Drews et al., 41 possibly due to the higher sensitivity of our assays. In the present study, Flu-A and HCMV were the most common viruses in the multiple-strain infections. It is possible that an outbreak of influenza A infection weakened immunity, and led to activation of colonized cytomegaloviruses and the replication of viral DNA. Most studies of infections caused by bacteria and viruses regard the viral infection as secondary to the bacterial infection. This indicates that concomitant viral infection should be considered if there is no response after long-term antibiotic therapy. 42 In summary, we showed that bead-based suspension array technology had a significantly higher sensitivity for bacterial detection and was not inferior to real-time PCR for the detection of virus and atypical pathogens in patients with acute respiratory tract pathogens. The use of beadbased suspension array technology has some limitations. Non-specific binding can cause interference. Moreover, since the Luminex technology platform is an open system, it is possible that PCR products may cause contamination in labs. Our present study also had some limitations. The positive rates for Mycoplasma and Chlamydia detection were not high enough for further evaluation. Furthermore, we did not analyze our data for false-positives. It is important to validate our findings in larger sample sizes in order to facilitate the transition of this technology to a clinical setting. ",
