Therapies targeted to host proteins involved in the viral life cycle offer an opportunity to both raise the barrier to generation of resistance and generate antivirals able to treat a broad range of viral diseases. However, this has been hindered in the past by the relative rarity of targets essential to the virus but nonessential to the host, and the inherent complexity of discovering and developing drugs that effectively target these proteins.",

These bioengineering techniques are readily combined with semisynthesis to identify molecules with further improved properties.

            "text": "Cyclophilins are a class of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases, proteins that catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of the peptide bond preceding prolyl residues. Knockout studies in several species, including mice and human cells, confirm that they have limited or no effect on cellular growth and survival (Luvisetto et al., 2008; Elrod et al., 2010; Dolinski et al., 1997; Colgan et al., 2000) . However, cyclophilins recruited from host cells have been shown to have essential roles in many viral life cycles. Initially, cyclophilin A was shown to be incorporated into HIV-1 virions (Thali et al., 1994; Franke et al., 1994) involved in viral replication, its expression level in patients being related to the speed of progression to AIDS . Isomerase activity of cyclophilin A, and potentially others such as cyclophilin B and cyclophilin 40, have been shown to be required for hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication (Chatterji et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2008; Kaul et al., 2009) . Other viruses in which cyclophilin involvement has been implicated in their life cycle or cyclophilin inhibitors have shown inhibitory activity include vaccinia virus (Damaso and Moussatch\u00e9 , 1998) , West Nile virus, Dengue virus, yellow fever virus (Qing et al., 2009 ), hepatitis B virus (HBV) (Ptak et al., 2008) , human papilloma virus (Bienkowska-Haba et al., 2009) , cytomegalovirus (CMV) (Kawasaki et al., 2007) , SARS coronavirus (Pfefferle et al., 2011) , Japanese encephalitis virus (Kambara et al., 2011) , and influenza A (Liu et al., 2012) .",

Fermentations with those analogs successfully accepted as substrates were scaled up to allow isolation of new sanglifehrins. The antiviral activity and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) properties of each analog were analyzed, and the best of the analogs were subjected to semisynthesis to yield the corresponding sangamides as described previously (Moss et al., 2012) . The resulting sangamides were again analyzed for antiviral activity and ADME properties, and from this NVP018 was chosen as a potential drug candidate (data not shown). NVP018 is derived from a sanglifehrin resulting from incorporation of 5-fluoro-meta-L-tyrosine. Semisynthesis replaced the spirolactam-containing portion of the sanglifehrin with a tertiary hydroxamic amide moiety (Table S1 ). Of the sangamides tested, NVP018 had the best combination of properties (Table 1) , including more potent inhibition of CypA PPIase activity and inhibition of HCV replicons.",

Alisporivir, for example, inhibits multiple transporter proteins, including OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and MRP2, which are involved in bilirubin transport. It is this inhibition which is now thought to be the mechanism for the dose-limiting hyperbilirubinemia (Avila et al., 2012) . These compounds also have drug-drug interaction concerns through inhibition of xenobiotic transporters such as Pgp and BSEP (Kapturczak and Kaplan, 2004; Wring et al., 2010) . Comparison of the inhibition of these transporters using vesicular transport or uptake transporter inhibition assays, and in vitro inhibition of the xenobiotic transporters Pgp and BSEP revealed that while alisporivir (ALV) and cyclosporin A (CsA) potently inhibited many of them, BC544 (Figure 1 , previously stated as compound 3o in Moss et al., 2012) and NVP018 showed minimal or no inhibition (see Table 2 ). To test the effect of NVP018 on bilirubin levels, we then dosed three mice with up to 250 mg/kg/day NVP018 for 7 days. In all cases, almost no increase was seen in either bilirubin or liver enzymes when measured at the end of the study (see Table S2 ).",

Use of recently approved drugs with high barrier to resistance, such as the nucleotide polymerase inhibitor (NPI) sofosbuvir, leads to high levels of viral clearance (AASLD 2011, abstract; Sulkowski et al., 2012) . Cyclophilin inhibition is one of the few mechanisms of action of HCV inhibition that consistently shows a high barrier to resistance, and in phase 2 trials some patients were clear of the virus after being treated for 24 weeks with 1000 mg/day ALV monotherapy (Pawlotsky et al., 2012) . Alisporivir, a nonimmunosuppressive semisynthetic derivative of CsA, is a potent cyclophilin inhibitor which was in phase 3 trials for the treatment of HCV infection. NVP018 could provide a suitable alternative backbone for use in an interferon-free combination. Comparison of the inhibitory potential of NVP018 with the semisynthetic sangamide, BC544, and ALV against HCV replicons revealed that NVP018 was much more potent in all assays, and was similarly active against all genotypes tested (see Table 3 ). Analysis of the effect of increasing levels of either human serum or fetal calf serum (FCS) also confirmed that there was no effect on antiviral potency with addition of up to 40% serum (see Table S4 ).",

This is due to their potency, high barrier to resistance, activity on multiple steps of the viral life cycle, and oral bioavailability. It is also worth noting the recent publications suggesting that these compounds might also have additional impact on interferon regulatory factors, which have long been implicated in the escape of certain viruses, such as HCV and HIV, from the immune system (Obata et al., 2005; Bobardt et al., 2013) . While cyclophilin inhibitors do not exhibit inhibition of all viruses, they have been shown to have activity against a wide variety of both RNA viruses (e.g. coronaviruses, HIV, and HCV) and DNA viruses (human CMV, HBV, varicella zoster virus). It is therefore tempting to speculate that cyclophilin inhibitors may be a step in the direction of agents with broad antiviral activity (Katze et al., 2002) .",

We hope that in the future, bioengineering and semisynthesis will be used more frequently in combination to optimize NPs with an aim to select candidates for clinical development. antiviral drug. This was achieved by a combination of biosynthetic engineering and semisynthetic chemistrybringing together the advantages of each method to more efficiently optimize a bacterially produced, genetically encoded natural product. The preclinical analysis reveals potent activity against HCV, HIV, and HBV and a significantly improved profile compared with both the parent natural product and the cyclosporin A (CsA) class of cyclophilin inhibitors, of which alisporivir was in phase 3 for treatment of chronic HCV infection. Semisynthesis of NVP018 from BC457 NVP018 was synthesized in three steps from BC457 using the same protocol as for compound BC544. In brief, BC457 was treated via modified Sharpless dihydroxylation conditions to form a diol, which was subsequently cleaved to generate an allylic aldehyde by the action of sodium periodate. Finally, the resultant allylic aldehyde was coupled with a suitable amide under Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons coupling conditions.",

The PPIase activity of recombinant CypA, produced by thrombin cleavage of GST-CypA, is determined by following the rate of hydrolysis of N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide by chymotrypsin. Chymotrypsin only hydrolyzes the trans form of the peptide, and hydrolysis of the cis form, the concentration of which is maximized by using a stock dissolved in trifluoroethanol containing 470 mM LiCl, is limited by the rate of cis-trans isomerization. CypA was equilibrated for 1 hr at 5 C with selected sanglifehrin derivatives using a drug concentration range from 0.1 to 20 nM. The reaction was started by addition of the peptide, and the change in absorbance was monitored spectrophotometrically at 10 data points per second. The blank rates of hydrolysis (in the absence of CypA) were subtracted from the rates in the presence of CypA. The initial rates of the enzymatic reaction were analyzed by first-order regression analysis of the time course of the change in absorbance.

The experiment was performed in the presence and absence of the test compound (applied to both the apical and basolateral compartments). For basolateral to apical (B-A) study, the P-glycoprotein substrate, loperamide (final concentration = 5 \u03bcM) was placed in the basolateral compartment. The experiment was performed in the presence and absence of the test compound (applied to the apical and basolateral compartments). Incubations were carried out in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 with a relative humidity of 95% at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. After the incubation period, the companion plate was removed and apical and basolateral samples diluted for analysis by LC-MS/MS. A single determination of each test compound concentration was performed. On each plate, a positive control inhibitor was also screened. The test compound was assessed at 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30 and 50 \u03bcM. The integrity of the monolayers throughout the experiment was checked by monitoring Lucifer yellow permeation using fluorimetric analysis. After analysis, an IC50 was calculated (i.e., inhibitor concentration (test drug) achieving half maximal inhibition effect).",
