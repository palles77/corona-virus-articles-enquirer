To explore the anti-cariogenic characteristics of rubusoside (Ru), a natural sweetener component in Rubus suavissimus S. Lee (Rosaceae), we investigated the inhibitory effect of Ru against the activity of mutansucrase and the growth of Streptococcus mutans. Ru (50 mM) showed 97% inhibitory activity against 0.1 U/mL mutansucrase of S. mutans with 500 mM sucrose. It showed competitive inhibition with a K i value of 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 mM and IC 50 of 2.3 mM. Its inhibition activity was due to hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions based on molecular docking analysis. Ru inhibited the growth of S. mutans as a bacteriostatic agent, with MIC and MBC values of 6 mM and 8 mM, respectively. In addition, Ru showed synergistic anti-bacterial activity when it was combined with curcumin. Therefore, Ru is a natural anti-cariogenic agent with antimutansucrase activity and antimicrobial activity against S. mutans.",

            "text": "Dental caries affects 80% of the world's population. It is costly to health care. Dental caries is initiated by interaction between acidogenic bacteria and sucrose in susceptible hosts. Streptococcus mutans is an acidogenic and acidtolerant bacterial species. It has been recognized as the primary pathogen of dental caries because of its ability to produce glucansucrase synthesizing water insoluble glucan called mutan [1] . Mutan can mediate the adherence of S. mutans and other oral bacterial species to tooth surfaces, contributing to the formation of dental plaque biofilms [2, 3] . Glucansucrases are a member of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 70 that catalyze the formation of glucan with various types of glucosidic linkages such as \u03b1(1-3), \u03b1(1-4), or \u03b1(1-6) bonds, from sucrose via transglucosylation reactions. Glucansucrases are classified at mutansucrase, dextransucrase, alternansucrase, and reuternansucrase, which catalyzed \u03b1(1-3), \u03b1(1-6), \u03b1(1-3 and 1-6), and \u03b1(1-4 and 1-6) bond formation, respectively [4] . S. mutans produces three extracellular glycosyltransferases (GTFs), GTF-I, GTF-SI and GTF-S, which are encoded by gtfB, gtfC, and gtfD, respectively. GTF-I and GTF-SI are mutansucrases that synthesize mainly insoluble glucan with \u03b1(1-3) glucosidic linkages [5, 6] . In addition, other crucial virulence factors of S. mutans include a membranebound F1Fo-ATPase system, agmatine deiminase system, enolase, and lactate dehydrogenase [7] . Diet, especially high sucrose intake, elevates the risk for dental caries. The cariogenic nature of sucrose has led food and beverage industries to develop alternative sweeteners without having carcinogenicity.",

It is a well-known natural nontoxic sweetening agent. It has been used in various food and beverage products [8] . In addition, Ru has been used to increase the solubility of several pharmaceutically and medically important compounds with poor solubility in water [9] . It can decrease the growth and glass-surface adherence of S. mutans [10] when Ru and sucrose are incubated together and then the growth, adherence, and acid production of S. mutans are measured. The mechanism involved in the inhibition of Ru against mutansucrase or its reduction of the growth of S. mutans is currently unknown. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the mechanism of action of Ru against mutansucrase and S. mutans growth. Kinetic characterization of Ru against mutansucrase activity and molecular docking analysis were carried out. The growth inhibition type of Ru against S. mutans was also studied.",

Mutansucrase was prepared by culturing S. mutans in brain heart infusion media (BHI; BD Difco, USA) supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose at 37 o C with shaking (at 150 rpm) until all glucose was consumed. After fermentation, cells were separated from the broth by centrifugation at 8,000 \u00d7 g for 15 min. The supernatant was concentrated using a Centriprep Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-YM10 (Merck, Germany) and loaded onto a DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography column (1\u00d71\u00d760 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Mutansucrase was eluted with a salt gradient of 0-1,000 mM NaCl in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8). Fractions containing mutansucrase were pooled and dialyzed with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) at 4\u00b0C. These dialyzed fractions were concentrated using a Centriprep Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-YM10 and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method using crystalline bovine serum as standard [9] . The partially purified enzyme was kept at -20\u00b0C for further study. One unit (U) of mutansucrase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 \u03bcM fructose from sucrose per min at 37\u00b0C and pH 6.8. Fructose concentration in the reaction mixture was measured with a D-fructose kit (Megazyme, Ireland). The kinetic parameter of mutansucrase activity (0.1 U/mL) was measured using 0-200 mM sucrose as the substrate for 35 min. Reaction responses were linear within this time frame. The Michalis-Menten constant (K m ) was calculated from Lineweaver-Burk plot [11] .",

Both the Ru solution and EGCG (250 mM) were filtered with a Minisart \u00ae syringe filter (0.2 \u03bcm, Satorius, Germany). A disc-diffusion antimicrobial test was carried out by spreading 100 \u00b5L of suspension containing 10 8 CFU/mL onto a BHI agar plate [15] . Then a 6-mm diameter disc containing 20 \u00b5L of 250 mM Ru, 250 mM EGCG, or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was processed in triplicate. These discs were impregnated into the inoculated agar plate. These plates were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 12 h.",

The free binding energy of Ru was -8.27 kcal/mol ( Fig. 2A) . Ru inhibited mutansucrase from S. mutans potentially through hydrophobic and hydrogen bond (H-bond) interactions between amino-acid residues in the active site pocket of mutansucrase and Ru (Fig. 2B) . Carbon atoms of Ru interacted hydrophobically with Leu 433, Leu434, Ala478, Asp480, Glu515, Trp517, and Tyr916. Ru formed three Hbonds with residues in the catalytic binding pocket of mutansucrase. The O 7 atom of the 2-hydroxyl group of the glucosyl group at C19 of Ru accepted an H-bond with the amino group of Lys977 at a distance of 2.61 \u00c5. The O atom of the side chain carboxyl group of Asp909 formed two H-bonds with O11 and O12 of the glucosyl group at C13 of Ru at a distance of 2.91 \u00c5 and 3.04 \u00c5, respectively. Our study confirmed the antibacterial activity of Ru by MIC and MBC studies. The antimicrobial activities of Ru against S. mutans growth were assessed by an inhibition zone assay and zone diameter measurement (Fig. S3) . Ru inhibited the growth of S. mutans. The inhibition zone at 5 mM/disc was 11.3 \u00b1 1 mm. EGCG was used as a positive control. Its inhibition zone at 5mM/ disc was 19 \u00b1 1 mm. MIC and MBC values of Ru against S. mutans were 6 mM and 8 mM, respectively (Fig. 3A) . MBC was higher than MIC, indicating that Ru could inhibit S. mutans as a bacteriostatic agent [20] . Ru is known to be less acidogenic than is glucose, maltose, fructose, or sucrose, which can be metabolized only very slowly or not at all by S. mutans [10] .",

The MIC value of curcumin has been reported against S. mutans [22, 23] . When trying to measure the MIC of curcumin against S. mutans, we faced difficulty in interpreting our results, possibly because of the insoluble and colored precipitant caused by its insolubility in aqueous phase and formation of a colored precipitate (Fig. 3B) . Thus, curcumin was prepared to be soluble in water with a Ru solution. The MIC value of curcumin could not be found, because of its precipitation in solution. CUR-Ru complex with 0.9 mM curcumin and 5 mM Ru was used for both MIC and MBC measurement (Fig. 3A) . By combining curcumin with Ru, the MIC value of Ru against S. mutans decreased from 6 mM by itself to 5 mM in the complex, and the MBC value of Ru decreased from 8 mM by itself to 5 mM in the complex. Such lower MIC and MBC values of the Ru-CUR complex compared to those of Ru by itself were due to the synergism between Ru and curcumin. This result suggests that Ru can inhibit S. mutans as a bacteriostatic agent, whereas the Ru-CUR complex can inhibit S. mutans.",

The while color material indicates the formation of insoluble glucan. The mutansucrase reaction mixture comprised of 0.1 U/mL mutansucrase, 500 mM sucrose, and 50 mM Ru in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and reacted at 37 o C for 12 h. The amount of water-insoluble glucan was determined using thin-layer chromatography (TLC). The amount of carbohydrates was analyzed by the AlphaEaseFC 4.0 Image Program which measures the integrated density value. In (B), the Ru concentration was 0 mM (\u2022), 1 mM (\u25cb), 2.5 mM (\u25ba), and 10 mM (\u2206).
