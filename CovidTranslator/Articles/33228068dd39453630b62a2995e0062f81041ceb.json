We hypothesized that the liver, as a central metabolic hub, may orchestrate systemic metabolic changes during infection. We infected mice with chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), performed RNA sequencing and proteomics of liver tissue, and integrated these data with serum metabolomics at different infection phases. Widespread reprogramming of liver metabolism occurred early after infection, correlating with type I interferon (IFN-I) responses. Viral infection induced metabolic alterations of the liver that depended on the interferon alpha/beta receptor (IFNAR1). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 repressed the transcription of metabolic genes, including Otc and Ass1, which encode urea cycle enzymes. This led to decreased arginine and increased ornithine concentrations in the circulation, resulting in suppressed virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses and ameliorated liver pathology. These findings establish IFN-I-induced modulation of hepatic metabolism and the urea cycle as an endogenous mechanism of immunoregulation.",

            "text": "Pathogens and concurrent tissue damage elicit complex context-dependent inflammatory response programs (Hotamisligil, 2017) . Chronic infections represent a particular challenge for the host organism, which is exposed to prolonged inflammation that may predispose to various co-morbidities, such as susceptibility to secondary infections and cancer (Okin and Medzhitov, 2012; Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005; Virgin et al., 2009) . The same inflammatory pathways can also control cellular tissue homeostasis and metabolism (Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015; Medzhitov, 2008; O'Neill and Pearce, 2016) . Different cell types and organs communicate with each other through soluble cytokines, thereby determining the quality, magnitude, and duration of both local and systemic immune responses (Medzhitov, 2008) . The liver is a central metabolic organ but also represents an immunoregulatory hub between blood-borne pathogens and the immune system (Jenne and Kubes, 2013; Protzer et al., 2012; Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006) . Hepatocytes are the functional unit of the liver parenchyma and the most abundant cell type of the liver. As such, their principal task is the turnover of metabolites during homeostasis. Yet they are also important immune signaling platforms that produce and react to a range of cytokines upon inflammation (Crispe, 2016; Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006; Zhou et al., 2016) . Hepatocytes themselves are permissible to a variety of chronic viruses, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in humans and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in mice (Guidotti et al., 1999; Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005) . The chronic infection model of LCMV represents a well-established and pathophysiologically relevant experimental model for the study of host-pathogen interactions and immune responses that induce a vigorous CD8 T-cell-dependent hepatitis (Zehn and Wherry, 2015; Zinkernagel et al., 1986) . The involved immunopathologic mechanisms seen in the LCMV model are similar to those observed in patients chronically infected with HBV or HCV (Guidotti et al., 1999; Rehermann and Nascimbeni, 2005) . Soluble inflammatory signals act mainly through cytokine receptors (Hotamisligil, 2017; Protzer et al., 2012; Racanelli and Rehermann, 2006) . Type I interferons (IFN-Is) are central antiviral cytokines that signal through the ubiquitously expressed IFNAR receptor, which is composed of the two subunits IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. This induces the expression of a broad array of genes described as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs exert antiviral functions by direct interference with viral replication and immunoregulatory properties (McNab et al., 2015; Schoggins et al., 2011) . More recently, IFN-Is are also recognized as modulators of metabolism, such as cellular lipid metabolism and redox homeostasis Pantel et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2016; York et al., 2015) . Cytokine-induced regulation of liver metabolism is expected to result in altered metabolite turnover and release that impacts distal organs (van den Berghe, 1991; Norata et al., 2015) . Immune cells and in particular T cells critically depend on certain metabolites to efficiently perform their functions and are thus susceptible to altered metabolite availability (Chang et al., 2015; Geiger et al., 2016; Johnson et al., 2018; Pearce et al., 2009) . In line with this, a frequent immune evasion mechanism of cancer is the depletion of essential amino acids or glucose in the tumor microenvironment (Buck et al., 2017; Chang et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2017; Murray, 2016) .",

This confirmed the peak of viral propagation around day 8 after infection with a subsequent decline of viral loads. Liver damage was assessed by the clinical hallmark parameters alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) that peaked on day 8-12 after infection ( Figure 1B) . In an unbiased approach to virus-induced changes in the liver, we collected liver tissue from infected mice at different phases of infection (day 2 z innate phase; day 8 z peak of disease; day 30 z chronic phase; day 60 z resolving phase) and performed transcriptome analyses by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The transcriptomic data showed high intra-replica reproducibility and individual samples clustered according to the time course of infection (Figure 1C) , highlighting phase-specific changes in gene expression and the gradual recovery of mice by 60 days after infection. In total, 3,626 transcripts were differentially regulated (Table S1A ) and the most differentially expressed genes were found on days 2 and 8 after infection ( Figure S1A ). Hierarchical clustering identified three broad categories of gene expression programs, including transcripts that were found already regulated on day 2 (clusters 1-4) or induced on day 8 (clusters 5-10) as well as transcripts that were repressed during infection (clusters 11-15; Figure 1D ; Table S2A ). To corroborate transcriptional alterations, we performed tissue proteomics and quantified 5,586 proteins in the liver (Table S1B) . Protein changes correlated with differentially expressed transcripts (Figures 1E and S1B; Table S2C ). Of the identified clusters, differentially expressed genes associated with antiviral IFN-I signaling were found to be enriched on day 2 (clusters 1-4; Figure 1F ; Table S2B) although leukocyte-associated genes were mainly found on day 8 after infection (clusters 5-10; Figure 1F ; Table S2B ). Some of these differential expression changes are likely to reflect hepatic immune cell infiltration ( Figure S1C ).",

Downregulation of metabolites on day 2 ( Figure S1E ) was observed for glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids ( Figure 1H ; clusters 1 and 3) although acylcarnitines ( Figure 1H ; cluster 4) were rather upregulated on day 8 after infection ( Figure 1H ). Systemic amino acids and biogenic amines exhibited a sustained decline from day 2 to day 8 and gradually recovered in the later phases of infection ( Figure 1H ; cluster 2). This affected almost exclusively essential and semi-essential proteinogenic amino acids (His, Ile, Leu, Met, Trp, Val, and Arg; Figure 1H ) and coincided with transcriptional regulation of amino-acid-related metabolic pathways on day 8 (Figures 1F-1H and S1F; Table S1C ).

We therefore performed a pair-feeding experiment to investigate the impact of infection-associated changes in food uptake to the metabolic reprogramming of the liver 8 days after infection. Uninfected mice received restricted amounts of food equivalent to the amounts consumed by infected mice. Subsequently, we collected liver tissue of infected, pair-fed, and naive animals and performed transcriptome analyses. These results indicated that most of the observed transcriptional changes were linked to viral infection and independent of anorexic behavior (Figures 2A, S2B , and S2C). Uninfected pair-fed mice showed only minor differential gene expression changes that pertained mainly to lipid metabolism (Figures 2B and 2C; Table S4 ).

            "text": "The observed changes of hepatic amino acid metabolism became noticeable as early as 2 days, which coincides with peak serum levels of IFN-a and IFN-b in mice infected with LCMV . Thus, we aimed to dissect a potential role of early IFN-I signaling in the observed changes in the liver. To measure the impact of IFN-I signaling on liver parenchyma, we performed an extracellular metabolic flux analysis of primary murine hepatocytes upon stimulation with IFN-b in vitro. IFN-b affected proxies for mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis in an IFNAR1-dependent manner ( Figures 3A  and 3B ), indicating that IFN-I signaling affects metabolism of hepatocytes. To deconvolute tissue heterogeneity in vivo and to assess the contribution of IFN-I signaling to metabolic reprogramming in the liver, we took advantage of a genetic model of hepatocyte-specific ablation of Ifnar1 (Alb-Cre ERT2 Ifnar1 fl/fl [Ifnar1 D/D ]) and respective littermate controls (Alb-Cre ERT2 Ifnar1 +/+ [Ifnar1 +/+ ]). These mice did not reveal any genotypespecific differences in viremia or serum concentration of IFN-a 1.5 days after infection ( Figures S3A-S3C) , suggesting that any potential differences seen in expression profiling of liver tissue from Ifnar1 D/D versus Ifnar1 +/+ mice is unlikely to be due to altered viral loads and/or systemic IFN-I responses. Moreover, naive and infected Ifnar1 D/D versus Ifnar1 +/+ animals displayed comparable abundances of immune-cell-related transcripts, suggesting only minor differences of immune cell infiltration between the genotypes at this early time point after infection ( Figure S3D ). Next, we analyzed transcriptomic changes of liver tissue taken from uninfected and infected mice of either genotype at the peak of serum IFN-a levels and employed a limma (2 3 2 factorial) interaction model. This resulted in a set of 526 hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1-regulated genes, which were found to be associated with both classical ISG responses as well as metabolic processes (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3E; Table S5A ). The regulated genes could be divided into two major classes-IFNAR1-stimulated (cluster 1) and IFNAR1-repressed (cluster 2) genes ( Figure 3C ; Table S5B ). The majority of induced genes were well-known classical ISGs encoding for antiviral effectors (cluster 1; Figure 3D ; Table S5C ; Schoggins et al., 2011) . Interferon-repressed genes (IRGs), which are not that well characterized (Mostafavi et al., 2016; Schoggins et al., 2011) , were found to be strongly enriched for metabolism-associated processes (cluster 2; Figure 3D ; Table S5C ). In addition, clusters 3 and 4 contained genes whose maintained expression depended on intact IFNAR1 signaling and were also associated with metabolic processes ( Figure 3D ; Table S5C ). Hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling mainly regulated metabolic genes on day 2 after infection. Notably, a bioinformatic intersection with our longitudinal data obtained from chronically infected wild-type mice suggested that the IFN-I-dependent regulation of many of these genes is maintained beyond these early time points ( Figure 3E ). Specifically, virus-induced gene regulation of amino-acidrelated pathways (Figure 1 ) was driven by hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling ( Figure 3E ) and corresponded with the differentially regulated metabolites observed in infected wild-type mice ( Figure 1H ). To investigate whether these metabolic changes depended on hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling, we performed metabolomics and found that systemic serum levels were indeed regulated by local IFNAR1 signaling of hepatocytes ( Figure S3F ). In a more stringent analysis using the limma (2 3 2 factorial) interaction model, we found 15 serum metabolites to be regulated by hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling, including the semi-essential amino acid arginine and its downstream metabolite ornithine ( Figure 3F ). In summary, our data indicate that hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling acts as a transcriptional regulator of liver metabolism and results in changes of circulating metabolites during infection.",

Expression analysis of liver tissue of uninfected and infected Ifnar1 D/D and Ifnar1 +/+ mice highlighted that expression of Otc and Ass1 was repressed in a hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1-dependent manner ( Figures 4A, S4A , and S4B). Arg1 was induced, whereas Asl was repressed upon infection, both independent of hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling ( Figure 4A ). These infectioninduced transcriptional changes of the urea cycle genes Otc, Ass1, Asl, and Arg1 were maintained on transcriptomic and proteomic level up to 30 days after infection, with the most pronounced effects seen on days 2 and 8 ( Figures S4C-S4F ). Of note, the regulation of Otc and Ass1 was independent of food intake ( Figure S4G ).",

            "text": "To corroborate the hepatocyte-specific origin of the observed reprogramming of the hepatic urea cycle, we performed singlecell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) of primary murine hepatocytes isolated from naive or LCMV-infected wild-type mice 2 days after infection. Both samples showed comparable numbers of reads (uninfected: 1,493.5; infected: 1,429.0) and genes (uninfected: 705.5; infected: 761.0) per cell. We identified 348 differentially expressed genes in hepatocytes that correlated well with changes observed in bulk liver tissue (Figures 1, S4H , and S4I). Accordingly, genes induced in hepatocytes were associated with antiviral innate immune responses, whereas repressed genes were vastly associated with metabolic processes (Figures S4J and S4K) . Hepatocytes clustered by the infection status of the mice ( Figure 4B ), and we confirmed hepatocyte-intrinsic repression of Ass1 and Otc upon infection, which inversely correlated with expression levels of the ISG Ifit1 on the single-cell level (Figures 4C and 4D) . Transcriptional repression of Otc and Ass1 manifested in reduced abundance of OTC and ASS1 proteins in hepatocytes as observed by immunohistochemistry on days 2 and 8 after infection ( Figures 4E and 4F ). As expected, STAT1, a master regulator of IFNAR1 downstream signaling, was significantly upregulated in hepatocytes ( Figures 4E and 4F ). The modulation of Otc and Ass1 on day 2 and day 8 after infection was confirmed by real-time PCR in sorted hepatocytes ( Figure 4G ). In line with this, liver tissue of infected mice exhibited reduced enzymatic activity of OTC and ASS1, which we measured by the abundance of the 13 C-labeled reaction products argininosuccinate (ASS1) or citrulline (OTC) after pulsing with 13 C-labeled sub-strates. Addition of the ASS1-specific inhibitor a-methyl-DL-aspartic acid (MDLA) abolished production of argininosuccinate and indicated specificity of the assay ( Figure S4L ). In line with the IFNAR1-dependent increase of systemic ornithine levels upon infection ( Figure 4A ), these data indicate that IFNAR1 represses the degradation of ornithine via OTC in hepatocytes. (E) Metabolism-associated transcripts significantly regulated by hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling super-imposed on the previously identified significantly regulated metabolic transcripts and proteins at the indicated time points after LCMV infection (based on Figure 1G ). (F) Serum metabolites significantly regulated (limma interaction model) by hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling in naive and LCMV-infected animals (n = 3). For (A) and (B), data for one out of two representative experiments are shown. For (C), (D), and (F), transcriptomic and metabolomic data are derived from one experiment.

To test whether similar responses in the liver are seen in an inflammatory context, we administered the synthetic viral RNA analog and TLR3 agonist polyinosinicpolycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) intraperitoneally to wild-type mice. Poly(I:C) treatment resulted in strong induction of Ifit1 and corroborated the upregulation of Arg1 and downregulation of Otc and Ass1 in liver tissue by real-time PCR ( Figure S4N ). Treatment with 100 ng recombinant IFN-a induced an ISG signature in the liver but did not yield reproducible changes of expression of these genes (data not shown), suggesting that interferon signaling is required, but not sufficient to regulate the urea cycle.",

            "text": "Next, we aimed to address whether viral infection leads to hyperammonemia, a hallmark parameter of urea cycle deficiency (UCD). Indeed, blood ammonia levels were significantly increased from 2 up to 8 days after LCMV infection, correlating with downregulation of the ammonia-fixating enzyme Cps1 ( Figures 5A and S5A ). This prompted us to further characterize the observed urea-cycle-related metabolic changes on a systemic level by in vivo tracing of 13 C 6 heavy-isotope-labeled arginine ( Figure 5B ). Liver tissue of infected mice that received a bolus of 13 C 6 arginine showed increased concentration of labeled ornithine and citrulline ( Figure 5C ). Arginine was not detected in the liver as reported previously (Wu et al., 2009 ). These local metabolic changes in the liver tissue, together with transcriptomic and proteomic changes in hepatocytes highly correlated with changes in systemic metabolism. We detected increased 13 C 6 arginine degradation in the serum ( Figure 5D ), which is consistent with the induction of Arg1 (Figures 4A and S4C) . Together with IFNAR1-dependent repression of Otc and Ass1 ( Figures 4A-4D ), this resulted in the systemic accumulation of 13 C 5 ornithine and 13 C 5 citrulline, respectively (Figure 5D) . In accordance with increased arginine degradation and decreased ornithine degradation, we detected elevated levels of 13 C 1 -labeled urea in liver tissue ( Figure S5B) , whereas 13 C 1 -labeled urea was only mildly elevated in the circulation ( Figure S5C ). Together with the reduction of 13 C 5 arginine, the end product of this pathway, these results support the notion that viral infection initiates a break of the hepatic urea cycle as early as 2 days after infection that persists at least until 8 days after infection and alters levels of metabolites in the circulation ( Figure S5D ).",

To test this in vitro, primary naive murine splenic CD8 T cells were activated with anti-CD3/CD28 antibodies for 3 days and IFN-g and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) production was assessed by flow cytometry. CD8 T cells cultured in medium with 11.5 mM arginine, a concentration comparable to the observed changes in vivo, displayed reduced cytokine production compared to standard cell culture medium containing 1,150 mM arginine ( Figure 6A ). Addition of ornithine, which is absent in standard cell culture medium, resulted in an additive suppressive effect on cytokine production ( Figure 6A ). This indicated that decreased concentrations of arginine impact CD8 T cell responses and that these effects are aggravated by a simultaneous increase of ornithine.",

As expected, recArg1 converted arginine to ornithine in the serum and closely recapitulated the decreased arginine-to-ornithine ratio seen upon viral infection ( Figures 5E and S6A ). Administration of recArg1 did not affect the abundance of splenic T cells of infected and uninfected animals on day 8 after infection (Figure S6B ).

CD8 T cell effector function remained impaired in recArg1-treated animals at least up to 50 days after infection ( Figure 6F ) and coincided with elevated viral loads in blood ( Figure 6G ) and organs 8 and 50 days after infection ( Figures S6F-S6I ). To investigate whether impaired cytokine production of CD8 T cells upon recArg1 treatment coincides with exhaustion, we analyzed PD1 expression on virusspecific CD8 T cells in the blood of mice 30 days after infection. This did not reveal any obvious differences for PD1 upon treatment with recArg1 ( Figure S6J ). Strikingly, treatment with recArg1 significantly ameliorated virus-induced CD8 T-cellmediated tissue damage as determined by reduced serum concentration of ALT and AST ( Figures 6H and 6I ). We conclude that modulation of the systemic arginine-to-ornithine ratio regulates antiviral T cell responses to ameliorate virus-induced tissue damage.",

The role of IFN-repressed genes in disease and homeostasis is still poorly understood. Yet it is noticeable that IFN-I-driven expression signatures from other organs and cell types do not appear to feature similar global repressive gene regulation (Mostafavi et al., 2016; Schoggins et al., 2011) . This potentially highlights a unique feature of the liver, which rapidly integrates inflammatory cues from the environment to modulate its intrinsic metabolism and, as a consequence, its systemic metabolic output to peripheral organs.

Next to other metabolic changes, we identified a regulatory effect of IFNAR1 signaling on the urea cycle, a central metabolic pathway that is primarily expressed in the liver. Its primary function is the conversion of circulating toxic ammonia into non-toxic urea with a fumarate shunt connecting the urea cycle to the TCA cycle (Meijer et al., 1990) . Fumarate can subsequently be metabolized to aspartate and a-ketoglutarate, two major precursors of de novo amino acid synthesis.

            "text": "Downregulation or even loss of Otc and Ass1 are common features of many cancers, limiting aspartate consumption by the urea cycle and instead feeding into de novo nucleotide synthesis associated with tumor growth (Feun et al., 2012; Lam et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2018; Rabinovich et al., 2015) . Otc and Ass1 are also crucial for de novo arginine synthesis. As a result, many tumors are auxotrophic for arginine, which renders arginine a metabolic vulnerability that is currently therapeutically exploited by recArg1 treatment of cancer patients (De Santo et al., 2018) . In line, UCDs and in particular Ass1 deficiency of tumors potentially synergize with checkpoint blockade treatment in tumors (Lee et al., 2018) . Interestingly, reduced serum levels of arginine are associated with less liver tissue damage in chronic HBV infection although increased serum levels of arginine and arginine derivatives have been associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Dumas et al., 2014; Li et al., 2011; Pallett et al., 2015; Soga et al., 2011) . Finally, deregulated ornithine metabolism and increased synthesis of polyamines may also impact cellular proliferation as well as the replication of diverse groups of viruses, potentially impacting on infection-associated cancer formation and progression (Casero et al., 2018; Mounce et al., 2016) . Using different approaches, we demonstrate that virusinduced IFNAR1 signaling in hepatocytes leads to downregulation of Otc and Ass1. The simultaneous upregulation of Arg1 during viral infection of the liver suggests that, during infection, hepatocytes are reprogrammed toward increased arginine degradation and ornithine accumulation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that infiltrating immune cells, including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), may contribute to increased Arg1 expression in the liver (Gabrilovich, 2017) . In line with this, our 13 C 6 heavy-isotope-labeling experiments confirmed that viral infection increases the hepatic conversion of arginine to ornithine and correlates with systemic accumulation of ornithine and citrulline. The observed infection-dependent reduction of the urea cycle end product 13 C 5 arginine further supported the notion of an IFNAR1-mediated break of the urea cycle. Still, these results do not rule out the potential additional contributions of extrahepatic events, as changes in the endocrine system are likely co-occurring with systemic metabolic reprogramming and/or sickness behavior during infection. Previous studies also established a link between hepatic autophagy, hepatocytederived circulating ARG1, and the systemic arginine-toornithine ratio, leading to reduced tumor growth in mice (Poillet-Perez et al., 2018) . These lines of evidence suggest that endogenous metabolic reprogramming of the urea cycle modulates the pathophysiology during infectious disease. Our results may also provide a potential explanation for why many non-hepatotropic infections result in concomitant hepatitis (Adams and Hubscher, 2006; Lalazar and Ilan, 2014) . Taken together, our study provides evidence for an infectioninduced reprogramming of the urea cycle in hepatocytes, a central metabolic pathway in the liver, leading to hyperammonemia alongside with the deregulation of systemic metabolism. We identified hepatocyte-intrinsic IFNAR1 signaling as a key regulator of circulating levels of arginine and ornithine to fine-tune adaptive immunity. This endogenous cytokinedriven mechanism of immunomodulation and host protection across organs could be targeted to ameliorate tissue pathology in infectious and inflammatory diseases.",

The first run included biological replicates from day 2 and day 8 after infection along with the uninfected controls. The second run included replicate samples of uninfected controls, day 30 and day 60 after infection. To account for the effect of aging, the third run included uninfected controls at day 0 and day 123, along with infected samples from day 123 (all in biological replicates). Identical uninfected controls (day 0) were included in all three TMT 6-plex runs as an internal control to monitor reproducibility between the runs. Liver tissues were homogenized (TissueLyser II, QIAGEN) in 1.5 mL 50 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.5 supplemented with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA, Pierce Biotechnology, Thermo Scientific, IL). Further processing was adapted from a filter-aided sample preparation (FASP) method previously described (Manza et al., 2005; Wisniewski et al., 2009 ). For each sample, 100 mg of the liver tissue lysate was reduced with 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and transferred into VIVACON 500 filter unit (Vivaproucts, Littleton, MA). SDS-containing buffer was removed from the sample by centrifugation and exchanged with 8 M urea in 100 mM Tris-HCl buffer. Proteins were alkylated with 50 mM iodoacetamide and washed with 50 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Finally, porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for protein digestion in an enzyme to protein ratio of 1:100 w/w. 7 or up to 17 samples were multiplexed per lane and run on a 50bp single-end flow cell in a HiSeq2000 or HiSeq3000 sequencer (Illumina), respectively. Called bases by the Illumina Realtime Analysis software were converted into BAM format using Illumina2bam and demultiplexed using BamIndexDecoder (https://github.com/wtsi-npg/illumina2bam). The RNA-seq analysis pipeline was performed with Tuxedo. Reads were mapped on the mouse reference genome (Mus musculus, Ensembl e87, December 2016) using TopHat2 (v2.0.10). Cufflinks (v2.2.1) was employed to assemble transcripts from spliced read alignments, using the Ensembl e87 transcriptome as the reference as well as de novo assembly of transcript models. Further, differential analysis of gene expression was quantified with Cuffdiff (v2.2.1). Transcriptome sets of all replicates for each sample group were combined with Cuffmerge. Expression values in graphs are reported as FPKM (fragments per kilobase pf transcript per million). Differential gene expression is attested based on expression level R 1 FPKM, adjusted p value % 0.05 and absolute log2 fold-change of 1 (heatmap) or 0.6 (circos plot).",

We used the Cell Ranger (v3.0.2) 10X Genomics software to demultiplex the raw sequencing data and align them to the mouse GRCm38 reference genome. We proceeded with the analysis of the UMI counts using the R Bioconductor package Seurat v3.1.0 (Stuart et al., 2019) . The two samples, uninfected and 2 days post infection, were merged and processed together. Cells with more than 30% mitochondrial content were discarded. Mitochondrial genes, as well as genes that were not detected in more than 1 cell were discarded. We used markers for Kupffer (Clec4f, Csf1r, C1qc, C1qa, C1qb) , endothelial (Kdr, Egfl7, Igfbp7, Aqp1) and hepatocyte (Apoa1, Apob, Pck1, G6pc, Ttr) cells for cell identification (Halpern et al., 2017) . In order to focus on hepatocytes, we kept only those cells that had a summed expression of hepatocyte markers greater than both the summed expression of Kupffer as well as endothelial cells markers. We also eliminated cells that had less than 0.5% of Alb reads. The normalization of the UMI counts was performed with the SCTransform from the Seurat Package, with the regression variable on the condition (uninfected and 2 dpi) . We further ran PCA on the normalized counts and the 3.000 most variable genes. Based on the Jack Straw method we selected the first 20 principal components explaining most of the variability and proceeded with a UMAP low-dimensional projection. Differential analysis between the 2 conditions was performed using the FindMarkers function in Seurat, based on the Wilcox test with a Bonferroni correction. Genes were considered as differentially expressed if they had an absolute average log2 fold-change greater than 0.2 and an adjusted p value smaller than 0.05.",

We extracted metabolism-associated genes from KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) metabolic pathways database. Only the pathways with q value of enrichment < 0.05 were considered. The enriched pathways are represented as a circos plot (Krzywinski et al., 2009) , with the width of each ribbon in a given category representing the percentage of genes at each time point among all genes leading to enrichments in the respective category. The color gradient (from lighter to darker) represents the percentage of pathways in each category that were found as enriched at a specific time point.",

Submission to the search engines was done via a Perl script that performs an initial search with relatively broad mass tolerances (MASCOT only) on both the precursor and fragment ions (\u00b110 ppm and \u00b1 0.6 Da, respectively). High-confidence peptide identifications were used to recalibrate all precursors and fragment ion masses prior to a second search with narrower mass tolerances (\u00b14 ppm and \u00b1 0.025 Da). Trypsin was chosen as cleavage specificity with the maximum of 1 miscleavage site allowed. Carbamidomethyl cysteine, N-terminal and lysine-modified TMT 6-plex were set as fixed modifications, whereas oxidized methionine was set as a variable modification.",

Based on the quartile values, we have set the cutoff at 0.25 and \u00c00.25 for up-and down-modulated proteins, respectively.

All metabolite abundances inferior to the limit of detection (LOD) were replaced with a value equal to half the LOD. We eliminated all metabolites that did not have an average abundance superior to LOD in at least one condition. Modulation of metabolites was assessed through a t test between conditions. The cutoffs for the modulation were obtained based on all the inter-replica pairwise comparisons of wild-type uninfected samples. The 2.5 and 97.5 quartiles of these inter-replica log fold-change were used to define the cutoffs. The cutoffs were \u00c00.44 and 0.65 for the whole liver dynamics serum metabolite measurements. For serum measurements of Ifnar1 D/D and Ifnar1 +/+ mice at 1.5 days post infection, based on the same approach, we have set the cutoffs at \u00c00.73 and 0.4. Significance was inferred based on a p value inferior to 0.05. For the interaction model (2x2 factorial design) of naive versus LCMV-infected Ifnar1 D/D and Ifnar1 +/+ , we implemented limma's interaction model as a two (Ifnar1 +/+ , Ifnar1 D/D ) by two (naive, LCMV-infected) factorial design. Significantly modulated metabolites in the interaction model were identified by an absolute log2 fold change of 0.7 and a p value inferior to 0.05.",
