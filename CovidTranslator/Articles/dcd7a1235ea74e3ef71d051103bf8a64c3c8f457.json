For Wuhan, 125 we first fit the number of confirmed cases (Fig. 3A) , where the R0 is 5.75, much 126 higher than that in most studies yet lower than Tang et al.'s result (Table 1) imported patients from Jan. 19 to Feb. 8, which is 3.67. We adopted this uncertainty 147 to run 200 simulation, and found the R0 1.4 is the perfect fit (Fig. 4A) . Considering 148 the strict community locking (close to any visitors) and other extreme control 149 measures (such as office building control, i.e. checking body temperature for every 150 one and refusing visitors) in Beijing, we adopted a lower R0 1.2 after the first 30 days 151 of transmission.

After the 130 city closure on Jan. 23, the residents of Wuhan performed strong self-protection by 131 isolating themselves at home, so that we halved basic reproductive number to 2.5, 132 reflecting the pattern of family cluster infection of the virus. Since Feb. 8, a door-to-133 door check was started in Wuhan in order to take all confirmed and suspected people 134 into medical care, and the transmission between family members dropped greatly. As 135 such, we further decrease the R0 to 1.5. With these transmission rates, the infectious 136 population could reach the peak of 1.75\u00b12.12 x 10 5 on March 6\u00b110, 2020.

The dynamics of virus transmission are dramatically different within and 180 without Hubei Province (Fig. 2), so that we gave different model parameters for the 181 two cities. Our results about infectious population in Wuhan is lower than Read et 182 al.'s estimation by 60%. Our estimation for Beijing is also much lower than the 183 prediction of other studies [e.g. 7, 8]. We believe we provide a more realistic forecast, 184 as we are witnessing the strict prevention activities carried out by all organizations 185 and local communities in Beijing, and the linear increase (not exponential increase) of 186 daily confirmed cases has proved the effectiveness of control measures. 187 China is running an antivirus campaign against 2019-nCoV. Besides the 188 lockdown of Hubei Province, many cities blocked the highway and stopped the traffic 189 through their domain. The longest vacation (for Chinese New Year) had been 190 extended twice. The majority of people quarantine themselves at home for 14 days 191 after travel. All domestic and international tourism were cancelled and banned. 192 Numerous meetings, games, shows have been postponed. Schools are still closed. 193 Compared with the prevention measures against SARS 17 years ago, this campaign 194 has much stricter control on local communities (only accessible to residents). In the 195 meantime, every people wear a musk during outdoor activities. Mandatory quarantine 196 for close contactors is not enforced at this time. 197 There are three difficulties in the antivirus campaign. 1. The incubation period 198 of 2019-nCoV is long. 2. Some patients have no symptoms yet they are infectious. 199 Although a case of no symptom transmission [17] had been proved flaw [18], more 200 other cases had been reported in many sources such as newspapers, website, and 201 Wechat, etc. The current prevention method, body temperature checking, could not 202 detect such people. 3.

Even over ten thousand medical workers from 209 other cities all over China have entered Wuhan for help, the infectious population is 210 still too large to be taken care of. However, starting from Feb. 2 and Feb. 8, two newly 211 established hospitals (Huoshenshan and Leishenshan Hospitals) with altogether 2500 212 beds for infectious patients have been already in service. With square bay hospitals 213 having been built and coming into use, and a door to door checking of all residents in 214 Wuhan started on Feb. 8, all infected and suspected people in Wuhan would be under 215 medical care. The infectious population in Wuhan, under the progressive prevention 216 activities, can be substantially lower (Fig. 3B) than the situation of natural 217 transmission of the virus. 218 Beijing is a representative of other large cities outside Hubei Province in China. 219 In Beijing, all confirmed and suspected cases have been taken into designated 220 hospitals, with their close contactors being tracked and quarantined in hotels or at 221 home. Similar controls are being implemented in other Chinese cities. The linear 222 increases of total number of confirmed cases (Fig. 2) indicates the spread of the virus 223 is under strictly control. The lockdown of Hubei Province substantially decreased the 224 imported infections, ensure the situation being manageable outside the province. 225 We kept the parameters of incubation period and serial interval constant for all 226 simulations. The uncertainty of these parameters also influences the results. The 227 estimation of R0, its variance, and the rate of susceptible population, as well as the 228 effect of control measures and warming climate, are relatively arbitrary. In spite of the 229 weakness, we provide a more accurate estimation than previous studies. We hope our 230 results are valuable for instructing further antivirus activities. 231 References 232 1.
