            "text": "Pain management for laboratory rodents often requires repeated restraint of the animals and injection of analgesic drugs at intervals of 6-8 h, which can cause stress 1 and potential injury. Analgesics that have longer durations of activity 2 can allow investigators to manage pain in laboratory animals with a single dose of drug, minimizing potential stress and injury. This is a goal of long-acting opiate therapy. Previous research has established the efficacy of opiates such as buprenorphine in animals [3] [4] [5] . Buprenorphine has a high therapeutic index and a 35-year history of safe use in veterinary medicine 6, 7 . Moreover, because opiates are a front-line therapy for pain management in humans, their use in laboratory animals comports with the objective of harmonizing pharmacology between laboratory models and human diseases 8 . Despite these advantages, opiate analgesia is rarely used with laboratory animals for various reasons 9 , including its potential to cause adverse effects. Reported adverse effects of opiate therapy include weight loss [10] [11] [12] , nausea [13] [14] [15] [16] and dermal lesions at drug injection sites [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .",

The authors used a target animal safety trial to evaluate the safety of extended-release buprenorphine in rats. Fischer 344 rats received post-surgical subcutaneous injections of 1.3 mg, 3.9 mg or 6.5 mg buprenorphine per kg body weight (two times, six times or ten times the intended dose, respectively), and their body weight, clinical signs and symptoms, clinical pathology and histopathology were monitored for 4 d. Body weight was not significantly different in rats that received buprenorphine compared with control rats. Signs of nausearelated behavior were observed in 25% of the rats treated with buprenorphine. Clinical pathology results for all rats were normal, and gross and microscopic histopathology examinations identified no substantial abnormalities, suggesting that this behavior was of minor consequence. Other adverse events previously reported to occur with opiate therapy, including weight loss and dermal lesions at drug injection sites, were not observed in this study. The results of this study show that post-surgical administration of an extended-release buprenorphine product is safe in Fischer 344 rats and does not necessarily cause substantial adverse effects, confirming that opiate therapy is a viable choice in laboratory animal medicine.",

The weight of each rat was within 10% of the mean weight of its group. At the start of the test the mean body weight of all females was approximately 130 g. The mean body weight of all males was approximately 180 g, with the exception of one heavier group that weighed a mean body weight of approximately 195 g. Rats were tagged with unique ear tags (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT) for identification and were housed in groups of two or three with cagemates of the same sex that were assigned to the same experimental group.

We then shaved the scapular region (between the shoulder blades), washed it with ethanol and painted it with povidone-iodine solution. We transferred the rat to a clean procedural area and assessed the depth of anesthesia by pinching the toe. Failure to respond to the toe pinch indicated that the rat had reached a surgical plane of anesthesia. Once this had occurred, we visually npg assessed and documented the rat's respiratory rate and capillary fill rate after pinching a toenail. We used clean, sterilized forceps to gently grasp the skin, and clean, sterilized scissors to make a 4-to 5-mm incision at the scapular region through the skin without penetrating the muscle or bone. We then used the scissors to separate the skin and create a subcutaneous pocket measuring approximately 2 cm \u00d7 4 cm. We apposed the edges of the incision and stapled them closed using a 9-mm Autoclip (Kent Scientific, Torrington, CT).

A similar absence of weight loss was also reported in rats that received 1.2 mg buprenorphine per kg body weight in a polymer formulation 19, 28 . These results contrast with previous reports of significant weight loss after post-surgical oral and subcutaneous administration of buprenorphine [10] [11] [12] . Weight loss in some cases was associated with gastric distress and pica (consumption of non-nutritive substances) 10, 11 . Pica occurs in response to nausea induced by opiate therapy 3,10 and has been reported in Sprague-Dawley 13,16 , Long-Evans 15 , Wistar 14 and Dark Agouti rats 12 . Pica is a complex phenomenon that might be beneficial in some circumstances. Consumption of kaolin (a behavior indicative of pica) after treatment with a nausea-inducing compound was correlated with less weight loss and greater food consumption in rats 29 . Pica can also have dangerous consequences, however. Previously in our laboratory, 1 of 15 male Fischer 344 rats was found dead on day 3 of a pilot study after it was treated with a single dose of 1.3 mg buprenorphine per kg body weight. Upon necropsy, the stomach and esophagus of the rat were noted to be compacted with hardwood bedding. This is consistent with a previous report that Sprague-Dawley rats consumed hardwood bedding and experienced gastric distention after treatment with buprenorphine 16 . In another study in which rats were housed on corncob bedding, pica-related mortality was reported in 5 of 25 animals treated post-surgically with buprenorphine or fentanyl, but no deaths occurred among 30 control rats npg or 20 rats treated with acetaminophen or flunixin 30 .",
