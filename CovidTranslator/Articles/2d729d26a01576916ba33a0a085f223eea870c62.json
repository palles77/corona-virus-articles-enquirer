A plaque assay using Sephadex was simple; however, viable plaques could not be collected for propagation, and fixation was necessary before evaluation. Plaque formation under agarose was optimized using diethylaminoethyl-dextran (DEAE-D) in the pre-treatment and absorption media and trypsin added to the absorption media and agarose overlay. The use of DEAE-D alone, trypsin alone or trypsin combined with DEAE-D significantly increased plaque numbers and visibility. Plaque numbers were highest when pre-treatment media contained DEAE-D, absorption media contained DEAE-D and trypsin, and the agarose overlay contained trypsin. The assay was useful for plaque isolation and quantification of sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDA), Parker's rat coronavirus (PRCV) and other coronavirus isolates from rats and its specificity was demonstrated by plaquereduction neutralization testing. These methods will facilitate production of cloned virus stocks for study of RCV biology and virus quantification for in vitro and in vivo studies of RCVs.",

Relatively little is known about the basic biology and biochemistry of these viruses, largely due to their fastidious growth requirements in vitro. Recent improvements in methods for cultivation of RCVs, including the use of the L2 mouse tibroblast cell line (Percy, 1989; Percy, 1990) supplemented with trypsin and diethylaminoethyldextran (DEAE-D) (Gaertner, 1991) , allow growth of virus to high titer and will facilitate study of RCV biology. Ideally, studies of RCV biology should be undertaken using plaque purified virus stocks and virus should be enumerated using a precise method such as plaque assay. However, plaque assays for RCVs have only been reported in LBC cells (Hirano, 1990) which grow slowly and support only limited replication of North American RCV isolates (Gaertner, 1991; Percy, 1989) .",

Used alone, a trypsin concentration of 2.5 pg/ml in the absorption media for 30 min and 1.25 ,ug/ ml in the overlay was optimal. When L2 cells were pre-treated and absorbed with DEAE-D-containing medium, the trypsin concentration had to be reduced to 0.41 pg/ml.

Reduced concentrations of trypsin (1.25 pg/ml) were used in the overlay after the FBS-containing inoculum was removed and the cell sheet was rinsed (data not shown). Trypsin treatment yielded larger, clearer, more easily countable plaques, probably by facilitating cell fusion through trypsin-cleavage of the viral S-glycoprotein (Storz, 1981; Sturman, 1985) .
