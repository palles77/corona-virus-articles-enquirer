For the past several centuries, major infl uenza pandemics have occurred every 10 to 30 years (1); it is widely believed that a new pandemic is \"inevitable\" (2) . The possibility of an imminent infl uenza pandemic has been heightened by the appearance and spread of avian infl uenza A (H5N1), which has a case-fatality ratio of >50% (3) . Although the assumption has been that avian infl uenza viruses could not directly infect humans, the transmission of infl uenza virus (H5N1) directly from chickens to humans in 1997 caused experts to reconsider that assumption (4) . Genetic changes in infl uenza virus subtype H5N1 in 2003 resulted in a new strain of the virus, which spread to multiple countries in East and Southeast Asia (5) , as well as Europe and Africa. Whether the avian infl uenza virus (H5N1) develops human pandemic potential, its spread from birds to humans and the severity of the resulting disease have heightened concerns about a possible future infl uenza pandemic.",

Past experience with natural disasters and current socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare in the United States (10, 11) raise questions about the adequacy of plans to address the needs of disadvantaged populations. For example, in responding to Hurricane Katrina, planners apparently failed to consider that many low-income persons might lack private modes of transportation and would depend on institutional help for evacuation. Although the evacuation was successful overall (12), deaths, injuries, and illness occurred disproportionately among low-income persons in New Orleans because of economic and logistic constraints on their ability to respond to government recommendations to leave the city. Low-income and disadvantaged persons often suffer disproportionately during natural disasters and epidemics, and historical evidence demonstrates that low-income persons fared considerably worse than high-income persons during the 1918 pandemic in the United States (13) .",

In addition, in the United States, low-income persons, African Americans, and nonwhite Hispanics are more likely than persons in other groups to obtain regular medical care at emergency departments and publicly funded clinics (10) , where airborne transmission of infectious agents has been documented. Because these locations typically do not segregate sick and well patients and are becoming increasingly crowded (16) , patients waiting for care in these settings are likely to have greater exposure to infl uenza viruses and other respiratory pathogens. Another source of increased exposure to infected persons is public transportation, where persons from low-income and minority households account for 63% of users (17) .",

The infl uence that most host factors will have on the development of infl uenza during a future pandemic is uncertain; some evidence suggests that the factors affecting disease severity and death may differ from those typically observed during annual infl uenza epidemics (19) . However, given overwhelming evidence that low-income persons are generally more susceptible to infectious diseases, it is reasonable to plan on the basis of well-documented annual epidemic patterns, in which infl uenza disease development is infl uenced by factors that are differentially distributed across socioeconomic and racial/ ethnic groups. These patterns, as well as patterns of many other diseases, indicate that socially disadvantaged groups are likely to be at higher risk for infl uenza disease, particularly severe disease. The inability to predict which infl uenza virus will cause a future pandemic, together with the very limited national and global capacity to produce infl uenza vaccine in massive quantities in a short time, almost ensures that an effective vaccine will be unavailable to most or all of the population during the early stages of a pandemic and in very short supply thereafter. Even so, current plans assume that local and state public health agencies will have a primary role for distributing pandemic infl uenza vaccine. In general, however, these plans do not adequately address preventing or minimizing socioeconomic or racial/ethnic disparities in vaccine distribution and acceptance, despite evidence that such disparities have been the rule for the annual infl uenza vaccine, even among persons >65 years of age (20) . In the United States, routine use of annual infl uenza vaccine in preschool children has only recently been introduced; information focusing on school-age children is limited (21) . Nevertheless, African American/black children and children from lower income families, who are at higher risk of contracting infl uenza (22) in this country, are less likely to be up to date with other routine immunizations (23) . It is possible that, in the context of an infl uenza pandemic, vaccine-seeking and acceptance behavior and resultant coverage patterns may differ from those observed during routine vaccination efforts; however, the weight of available evidence indicates that social disparities in vac-cine coverage are likely to occur in the absence of careful planning to prevent them.",

Even so, current planning efforts recognize the potential importance of reducing disease during a pandemic, through early treatment with antiviral drugs and through other forms of treatment such as respiratory support and antimicrobial agents to treat secondary bacterial pneumonia, among those with more severe disease.",

            "text": "In the United States, the likelihood of substantial disparities in access to timely and appropriate care under infl uenza pandemic conditions is high, given long-standing and persistent disparities in access to medical care. For example, persons with low income are \u22482\u00d7 as likely as those with higher incomes to lack a usual source of healthcare (24) . Similarly, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic persons are signifi cantly less likely than non-Hispanic white persons to report having a usual primary care provider (10). Among persons who do report having a usual source of care, those who are poor or near poor and those who are non-Hispanic black or Hispanic are 2.5-4\u00d7 as likely as their relatively higher income and white counterparts to rely on a hospitalbased source of primary care (24) . These same groups are also more likely to report having diffi culty obtaining timely appointments for illness or injury, which suggests problems with access to care even among those with a usual source of healthcare (10) . Language and cultural barriers to seeking and receiving medical care also may contribute to disparities. In emergency departments, for example, interpreters are frequently unavailable or underused, which has potentially adverse implications for patients' understanding of their disease or treatment and for clinical decision making Emerging Infectious Diseases \u2022 www.cdc.gov/eid \u2022 Vol. 14, No. 5, May 2008 711 Table. Factors that could contribute to health disparities among socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups during an influenza pandemic Differences in exposure to influenza virus Crowding in households, medical facilities, public transportation Occupational factors such as inability to work from home, dependence on childcare outside of the home Differences in susceptibility to influenza disease, once exposed to the virus Host factors, including preexisting immunity, age, other underlying diseases or conditions, smoking, nutritional status, stress Vaccination status, reflecting differences in vaccine seeking and acceptance and in vaccine availability Differences in timely effective treatment, once influenza disease has developed Access to outpatient and inpatient medical care Care-seeking attitudes and behavior Financial obstacles, including lack of adequate insurance coverage Logistic obstacles, including transportation, language Quality of care Availability of antiviral treatments Appropriate inpatient treatment and quality of care (25) . In addition, the large numbers of persons who lack health insurance, as well as those who lack documentation of US citizenship, often delay seeking care because they are concerned about paying for the care or encountering legal diffi culties. Evidence from previous outbreaks suggests that antiviral drugs may be effective for treatment (26) and prevention (27) of pandemic infl uenza, and current antiviral drugs seem to be biologically effective against 1918 and 1918like viruses (28) . Because vaccine may not be available when a pandemic begins, experts have suggested that the antiviral drug oseltamivir should be stockpiled for use during a pandemic infl uenza outbreak. Recent models suggest that early use of oseltamivir may contain outbreaks if certain criteria regarding transmissibility and compliance are met (29) . However, experience with nonpandemic infl uenza indicates that oseltamivir must be given early during symptom development for it to have any substantial biological effect (30) ; modest delays may vitiate the treatment effectiveness (31) . Although plans for release and distribution of antiviral drugs are still being fi nalized, overcoming long-standing disparities in access to timely treatment by socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, ability to speak English, and legal status will present numerous challenges to ensuring equal access to such drugs during a pandemic.",

Although the proposed schema very reasonably fi rst defi nes groups of different priority levels according to occupation and then, within the general population, according to age and pregnancy status, it does not provide explicit attention to groups who are vulnerable because of social disadvantage. Nor does it note the need for explicit attention to vulnerable social subgroups, for example, low-wage workers in prioritized occupational fi elds and low-income and minority pregnant women, infants, and toddlers. We are not questioning the rationality of defi ning major priority groups according to occupation or of using biological criteria to further prioritize within the general population.

However, because private pharmacies and private practitioners are less likely to be located in lower income neighborhoods, plans to make access to potentially lifesaving vaccines and drugs speedier and more equitable might, in fact, exacerbate disparities. Distribution plans may need to include mobile community health centers (staffed by nurses and nurse practitioners) that can travel to low-income areas, along with a variety of community medical and other service providers and nontraditional sites like soup kitchens, sheltered workshops, and transit points, which have become popular places for administering yearly infl uenza vaccine (40) .

Access to a private car may be a major determinant of who is able to obtain care, presenting constraints like those that led to disparities in evacuation from New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina.

These disparities can, however, be minimized through careful planning that considers and proactively addresses vulnerability at each level: exposure to disease, susceptibility to disease if exposed, and treatment of disease. Public offi cials should systematically consider the additional barriers faced by socially disadvantaged groups at each of these levels and then actively seek ways to address those barriers. Local service providers, leaders of community-based organizations and other organizations working with socially vulnerable groups, and leaders of labor unions representing low-wage service workers are likely to have valuable insights and should be included in the planning process.
