Nosocomial spread has also been described. No specific antiviral treatment is available and treatment is mainly supportive and symptomatic. 5 A novel 2019 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family. It shares more than 79% homology with SARS-CoV, 6 and causes mild to severe disease, with fatal bilateral viral pneumonia described in humans. 7 ,8 It is referred to as a novel coronavirus because it has not previously been observed in the human population. Its likely reservoir is bats, with pangolins identified as the likely intermediate host. 9 It is worth mentioning that pangolins are endangered and the most trafficked animal in the world. 10 Because the pangolin trade is illegal, this would explain why they were not listed in the official registers of the Wuhan market, making it difficult for researchers to identify the source of the virus. Some researchers are suggesting that the virus may have been circulating previously, and the market may have been an amplification setting and not the source of the spillover. 11",

Humans are coming into contact with environments that were previously untouched, meaning that they will also come into contact with the viruses and bacteria that are inherent to those environments. Many of these will have no impact on human health but some do. 2, 12 Human actions that impact animals, such as changes in land use and climate change have a profound effect on how these diseases spread. As our climate changes, certain populations of animals (especially mosquitos or other animals that function as disease vectors) increase and spread into geographic zones that were previously uninhabitable to them, they are more likely to spread the diseases that they carry to new regions. Changes in land use and changes in human/animal contact, also affect the emergence/reemergence and spread of disease, as does the unmanageable explosion of the global wildlife trade. Legal and illegal wildlife trade is estimated to affect 1 in 4 mammal and bird species globally, and to generate between $7.8 and $10 billion annually. 13, 14 In response to COVID-19, China has placed a temporary ban on wildlife trade on the 26 th of January. 15 Although this will likely only affect the legal wildlife trade (temporarily), it is a step in the right direction.",

The \"monoculture effect\" is well known in agriculture, but there is mounting evidence that it is important in animal farming as well. 16, 17 Although the aforementioned studies look at wild animal populations, there is a high indication that it holds true for animals raised for food. Often large populations of specific species of animal raised for food are kept in suboptimal conditions. Without even mentioning the inherent issues of waste management and animal welfare, industrial farming also creates health risks for humans in multiple ways if these populations are not isolated from wild animals of similar species. In the case of avian influenza, the virus, which circulates naturally in wild bird populations, came into contact with large homogeneous populations of birds in poultry farms. 18 Because of the disease potential associated with intensive animal farming, animals are often treated with vaccines and antibiotics. Both the avian and swine influenza continue to be managed through the regular vaccination of livestock. 19 Though the main reason for antibiotic use in farming is to preserve human and animal health and prevent zoonoses, widespread use of antibiotics in terrestrial animal production (including first line antibiotics such as colistin) promotes antibiotic resistance. 20, 21 In farming, antibiotics are used as prophylactics to make up for crowded unhealthy conditions, and growth promoters as well as therapeutic treatments for specific disease outbreaks. So although they are relevant tools for decreasing zoonoses, antibiotic use in animals can also become the catalyst for the development of zoonoses that are resistant to antibiotics. 22",

Currently the world's highest rate of deforestation is of Malaysian forests for the creation of palm oil plantations.

Health systems are varied, a small outbreak of the flu in a high resource country with a robust health system will likely only have a small impact on the continual habitual or average delivery of health services that have nothing to do with the outbreak. A health system that is fragile, or already overloaded by either routine care or another emergency needs only a little disruption to damage it or even causes it to collapse. Traditionally, supranational organizations, international institutions and non-governmental organizations will fill that response vacuum as well as is possible. An example of this and how difficult it is to implement effectively would be the international response to the 2014 Ebola epidemic. 35, 36 An outbreak in one country can deeply affect not only that country's economy, the world economy, but also its political relationships with other countries such as trade agreements, opening or closing national borders, etc. Economists are expecting China's economic growth to slow down to 4.5% because of the outbreak. 37",

As SARS-CoV-2 has not been seen before in humans, the population is completely na\u00efve. The virus has also shown to have high inter-human transmission. There is not yet enough data available for exact figures concerning the spread, but there have been initial estimates that each infected person would infect, on average, 2.6 other people (uncertainty range: 1.5-3.5). 38 The WHO estimates are a bit less daunting, reporting a preliminary R 0 estimate of 1.4-2.5. 39 Importantly, the Imperial College London calculations estimate that infection control measures need to block well over 60% of transmission to be effective in controlling the outbreak. 38 That number is most likely inaccurate, but this will be easier to assess as time goes on. In the case that the virus can be transmitted by an asymptomatic individual, 40 then having a 60% effective infection and control (IPC) strategy will be even more difficult to implement, especially because most of the people infected are in the community and not in healthcare settings. However, the initial report of asymptomatic transmission in Germany was inaccurate, which is encouraging. 41 A further challenge is posed by the decision of foreign governments to evacuate and repatriate their citizens from China. The inevitable quarantines and infection control measures that need to be taken as people arrive back to their home countries will be crucial for preventing the spread of the virus. 42 The Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 in Japan, with more than 691 infected people and four deaths (as of Feb 25 th ), is an example of the inadequate IPC in the community that led to a disaster. [43] [44] [45] The SARS-CoV-2 genome has already been sequenced and countries are working hard to find develop a vaccine. [46] [47] [48] It is difficult to tell what the actual mortality of the virus is, as the current death toll includes all-cause mortality of infected people and is likely overestimated by the testing of mostly sicker patients, though this information will emerge over time. SARS-CoV-2 seems to mostly be spread by droplets, and not through air. Nosocomial transmission have been described, 49 and superspreading events in hospital settings may occur. SARS-CoV-2 is possibly spreading indirectly through contaminated surfaces and hand contamination as well, but the lack of aerosol transmission will make the spread less efficient. According to the WHO, 25% of current cases are considered severe, 39 but this proportion would presumably decrease while more patients and contacts would have been searched for and screened.",

Although there is not yet enough information available, the SARS-CoV-2 may be less deadly than the influenza virus that hospitals deal with on a yearly basis, and transmission seems to mostly occur through droplets. Even a high estimate of the R 0 rate is many times lower than for airborne diseases such as measles, for instance. 54 It's important to remember that the R 0 rate refers to the average transmissibility of the disease, and does not give information on how fast it will spread. Seasonal influenza has an R 0 of around 1.3, but circulates through the whole human population every year. 55 HIV, on the other hand, spread far more slowly through a population, yet has a highly variable reproductive rate 56 .

It has a similar reproductive rate to estimates of the R 0 of SARS-CoV-2, but only infected around 8,000 people. In the early phase of the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak, the lack or inappropriateness of IPC measures used proved to be associated with an increased risk for cross-transmission and within-hospitals spread of the disease among both visitors and healthcare staff. [58] [59] [60] In contrast, when appropriately applied, IPC measures were extremely effective during the SARS epidemic. 61 Similarly, IPC measures will certainly prove to be extremely effective in respect to SARS-CoV-2, but we need more detailed transmission models. 62 In a 2003 analysis of SARS in Hong Kong that excluded super-spreading events, the reproductive rate dropped from 2.9 during the initial phase of the epidemic, to 0.4 after the implementation of IPC measures. 63 Usually, once the reproductive rate falls below 1, the outbreak will die out on its own. Therefore, having a strong and adapted IPC response to this outbreak will be crucial to stopping it. An additional factor is that people infected by SARS-CoV felt unwell and were likely to seek care in hospitals. SARS-CoV-2 seems to cause a wider range of symptoms, and if people only show mild infections, the infection may stay unnoticed (with people thinking that they have a common cold). This can cause the disease to be underdiagnosed, which means that people will be more likely to continue to spread the virus.",

The lack of IPC in developing countries with limited resources is a major dilemma that leads to high rates of healthcare-associated infections. 65 Hand hygiene is arguably, the most important infection control procedure, and is often neglected by health-care workers in these countries. 66 While developing countries still lack the equipment, expertise, and health infrastructure to detect and manage patients, 65 SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly in these unprepared countries . 67 It has been recommended to promptly prioritize resources, precise surveillance, and capacity development in countries with low preparedness for diagnosing the virus and limiting transmission. 68",

            "text": "The scale of China's response to the pandemic is unprecedented. Extreme cordon sanitairetype quarantine measures have questionable efficacy and can jeopardize trust between healthcare providers and the population. This was seen in the 2014 Ebola epidemic, when Sierra Leone's government imposed a three day quarantine and sent police and military house to house both to educate the population and to find people harboring Ebola patients in their homes. 69, 70 That said it, the COVID-19 outbreak is a delicate situation, and a difficult decision for China's government to take-any decision will have major risks. Still, quarantining a major region will most certainly result in practices that could be considered human rights violations. 71 It is worth noting, that such a large scale dedicated disaster response by the government would be much more difficult to implement in a democratic country. China worked day and night to construct two hospitals within a matter of days. They were made of prefabricated buildings, and serve to help handle the overwhelming number of patients. 72 On the 28th of January, after just 48 hours of construction, they opened another 1,000 bed hospital that had been retrofitted into an empty building. 73 China has an impressive track record for being able to implement huge engineering projects at a record pace: during the 2003 SARS epidemic, they were able to construct a 1,000 bed hospital in under a week, using prefabricated buildings. At the height of the epidemic, the Xiaotangshan Hospital treated one seventh of the SARS patients in the country. 74 Countries are often motivated to be cautious in declaring an emergency rather than alarmist, as this has severe economic repercussions. The speculations that China knew about the outbreak before they declared it seems to be well-founded: on January 27th, the mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, admitted that \"we haven't disclosed information in a timely manner and also did not use effective information to improve our work.\" 75 Locally, officials might have little motivation to declare an emergency to their superiors. 53 Quarantines were announced hours before they were put in place which could have encouraged people to flee-around 5 million residents reportedly left Wuhan before the quarantine was in place. 75 Deciding when to declare a national or international emergency is always difficult risk- 78 The direct economic burden of the 2014 Ebola outbreak is estimated between $2.8 billion 79 and $32.6 billion of lost gross domestic product. With the comprehensive economic and social costs factored in, the cost to the global economy was estimated at over $51 billion, with $18 billion in deaths from non-Ebola causes. 80 The impact of the outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 has spread from Asia to other parts of the world including Europe. With the emergence of many SARS-CoV-2 cases in Italy and South Korea as two of the world's major economies, concerns have been raised regarding a global economic damage. 81 After some debate, the WHO declared SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on the 30 th of January. The process leading up to this decision is complex and impacts many people; on the one hand such a declaration is an international call for alarm, but on the other, it does not guarantee that the outbreak will be ended or the exact nature of the international response. 82 The WHO initially declined to label the coronavirus outbreak as a PHEIC, as doing so would be extremely disruptive. The member views concerning this decision were quite divided during the first meeting, but the WHO agreed to reassess this decision in a few days' time, 39 and changed its global risk assessment for SARS-CoV-2 from \"moderate\" to \"high\". 83 It maintains that there is no evidence that donors withheld disaster relief funds if a PHEIC was not declared. 84 It is worth noting that the WHO repeatedly declined labeling the 2018 Ebola outbreak as such as well, showing that there is a tendency to err to the side of caution. 85 When it did in 2019, there was prevailing opinion that the PHEIC designation would be game changing in terms of resources allocated and international response. 86 We predict that the PHEIC designation for coronavirus will help mobilize response on a global scale.",

The same scientific work that is used to study a disease can in and of itself create biological risk. 87, 88 Both national governments and supranational organizations state that this issue is of utmost importance, and have pledged their commitment. 89-91 Nonetheless, expert consensus is that there is a high chance of the world dealing with a devastating pandemic in the near future, and that we are quite unprepared. 87, [92] [93] [94] So far, there have been relatively few cases abroad, but a great many in China. Still, the number of cases in countries other than China continues to grow. Outside of China, there is a growing number of cases and casualties, with 12 deaths in Iran, 10 in South Korea, 7 in Italy, 4 on the Diamond Priness cruise ship, 2 in Hong Kong, and 1 each in France, Japan, Taiwan, and the Phillippines. 45 Coupled with the exponential growth of the pandemic, the very short pre or pauci-symptomatic and infectious incubation period of the virus, as well as the possible prolonged high-level carriage, makes it quite difficult to contain. 40 One probable scenario is that SARS-CoV-2 will just become another human virus that the world deals with on a regular basis. WHO director-general Dr. Tedros warned of a potential global pandemic: \"The window of opportunity is still there, but our window of opportunity is narrowing,\" he said on Friday. \"We need to act quickly before it closes completely.\" 95 It seems to not be as dangerous as initially thought, so perhaps, once again, humanity will be lucky.

Healthcare institutions can organize beds and isolation rooms, and IPC teams can set up hotlines in anticipation of the virus. Though more easily said than done, having a clear definition of what constitutes a suspect case is crucial. The case definition will evolve rapidly in a context where the epidemiological risk changes with geographic spread of the disease, and possible new information about its epidemiology. In order to contain the outbreak, the case definition should be broad at an early stage. It is also important for IPC teams to work with hospitals in expanding their triage capacity and deciding how to organize the activities during a period with a potentially unusually high influx of patients suspected to have the virus. Liaising with the virology laboratory to define additional hours and workforce if needed, can be an additional step to help ready an institution. Healthcare staff must be reminded on the importance of hand hygiene and of standard precautions, contact precautions, as well as any complementary measures in preventing the spread of the disease.",
