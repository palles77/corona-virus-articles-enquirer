            "text": "A cytopathogenic virus (designated the Aichi/2004 strain) was isolated in a human rectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HRT-18) from the ileum contents of a calf with diarrhea. Oval and elongated particles, approximately 100 to 170 nm in diameter, with club-shaped projections were seen in the infected culture supernatant, and torovirus-like (tubular and torus nucleocapsid) structures were seen in the infected cells by electron microscopy. An antiserum against bovine torovirus (BToV) reacted with the infected cells by immunofluorescence and neutralized the isolate. However, antisera against bovine coronavirus (BCV) failed to react with the infected cells by immunofluorescence or did not neutralize the isolate. Further, the isolate was positive for BToV by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) targeting fragments of the nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and spike (S) genes. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the PCR products with those of the published N, M, and S genes (476 to 497, 672, and 687 to 690 nucleotides, respectively) of toroviruses showed high sequence identities (up to 99.4%, 98.7%, and 94.9% for the N, M, and S genes, respectively) between the isolate and BToVs. In contrast, the isolate was negative for BCV by RT-PCR. In a serological survey of serum samples from 355 calves at 33 farms, 92% of calves were positive for neutralizing antibodies to the isolate. These results indicate that the isolate in this study was BToV and that BToV infection might be common in cattle in Japan. To our knowledge, this is the first isolation of BToV in tissue culture.",

The prototype torovirus is equine torovirus strain Berne (BEV), which was isolated from a horse with diarrhea in Berne, Switzerland, in 1972. BEV could be propagated in embryonic mule skin cells and is the only cell culture-adapted torovirus (29) . Although culture-adapted BEV has not been demonstrated to be pathogenic experimentally, most adult horses possess neutralizing antibodies to BEV. In addition, neutralizing antibodies to BEV have been found in sera from cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, rabbits, and cats (30) . Antigenic cross-reactivity between human and animal toroviruses has been demonstrated, for example, by hemagglutination inhibition and immunoelectron microscopy (1, 6) .",

BToVs cause diarrhea both in experimentally infected gnotobiotic calves and under field conditions (5, 7-9, 12, 14, 19, 32, 33) . They infect villous and crypt enterocytes of the mid-jejunum, ileum, colon, and cecum, inducing villous atrophy and necrosis of the crypts in calves (12, 19, 31, 32) . Respiratory infections with BToVs have also been reported (7) . To date, BToVs have not been propagated in bovine tracheal organ culture, cell culture (e.g., primary calf kidney cells, primary bovine thyroid cells, HRT-18 cells, and MDBK cells), or em-bryonated eggs (32) ; rather, the only way to propagate the virus is via inoculation of gnotobiotic or colostrum-deprived calves. Immunological reagents for detecting BToV antigens and antibodies are therefore available in only a few laboratories, and consequently, details of the antigenic relationship between toroviruses and the epidemiological features of BToV infection remain unknown.",

The isolate stained with an antiserum to BToV, but not with an antiserum to BCV, by immunofluorescence. Further, an antiserum to BToV neutralized the isolate with a high titer, whereas an antiserum to BCV failed to neutralize it. Moreover, the nucleotide sequences of the isolate were markedly similar to those of published BToVs but not to those of BCVs. From these results, we concluded that the isolate in the present study was a BToV, and we designated it strain Aichi/2004.

BToV did not grow in HRT-18 cells when it was first propagated in gnotobiotic calves in 1979 (32) . The reason why strain Aichi/2004 could grow in HRT-18 cells in the present study remains unknown. Given that we employed no special methods for virus isolation, one possibility is that this isolate is a mutant virus that has been modified in a way that enables it to replicate in HRT-18 cells. However, an alternative possibility, which cannot be ruled out, is that the properties of the HRT-18 cells used in the present study may have changed to increase the torovirus tropism, despite the facts that no morphological change was observed at the microscopic level and the HRT-18 cells used here still possessed sensitivity to BCV. As possible evidence for this, the nucleotide sequences of the N, M, and S gene fragments were not unique to the isolate. In any case, further studies are needed to determine the full-length genome sequence of strain Aichi/2004 and to comprehensively compare the genetic properties of Aichi/2004 with those of BToV Breda 1, for which the full-length genome sequence has been determined (4).",

In contrast, serological differences have been observed between BEV and BToVs (1). Further, BToVs have been subdivided into two serotypes (33) . The cell cultureadapted Aichi/2004 strain is useful for clarifying the serotypic properties of toroviruses. In a genetic comparison, toroviruses were differentiated by host species into four genotypes (cattle, horses, humans, and pigs), whereas intertypic recombinations were observed (22) . The present study indicates that BToV Aichi/2004 is genetically closer to the recently identified European BToVs than it is to the Breda 1 strain. Given that Breda 1 was detected more than 20 years ago, this genetic distance might reflect the time of detection (22) . BToVs have been reported to be enteric pathogens that cause mild to severe diarrhea in experimentally or naturally infected young calves. In the present study, the rectal contents were positive for GAR as well as BToV. Therefore, the cause of diarrhea in the calf was unknown. Experimental infection of calves is necessary to elucidate the pathogenicity of BToV strain Aichi/2004.",

In the present serological survey, 92% of calves were positive for BToV neutralizing antibodies, suggesting that BToV infection in cattle is also common in Japan. The BToV antibodies at high titers in calves aged 3 months and younger might be maternally derived. An increase in antibody titers at the age of 10 to 12 months implies active infection at this time. Although BToVassociated diarrhea has not been reported in Japan, diagnosis of bovine diarrhea should include BToV examination.
