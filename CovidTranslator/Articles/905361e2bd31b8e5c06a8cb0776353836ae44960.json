Blocking CXCR4 signaling on NPC transplantation impaired NPC migration, arguing for an important role for this chemokine signaling pathway in contributing to repair by mediating trafficking to sites of myelin damage. 9 However, the molecular mechanisms governing positional migration of NPCs are likely complex and consist of additional soluble factors that affect the ability of NPCs to effectively congregate within areas of white matter pathology.",

            "text": "We examined the functional role of S1P signaling after NPC transplantation into the spinal cords of JHMV-infected mice. FTY720 is a U.S. Food and Drug Administrationeapproved oral drug for treatment of patients with relapsing MS. 22,23,29e31 FTY720 exerts immunomodulatory effects that reduce acute relapses, new lesion formation, and disability progression and brain volume loss in MS patients. 32 The mechanism(s) behind FTY720 functions are not yet defined; however, the phosphorylated active form of FTY720 (FTY720P) is an S1P receptor modulator that inhibits egress of lymphocytes from lymph nodes. FTY720 is a functional antagonist of S1P1 on lymphocytes, 20 yet also can act as a nonselective agonist of S1P1, S1P3, S1P4, and S1P5. 33 Therefore, the available evidence suggests that cellular source and receptor expression profile are critical in terms of how FTY720 affects S1P signaling, and likely lead to a dampening of autoreactive T cells specific for myelin antigens infiltrating into the CNS. More important, FTY720, because of its lipophilic nature, penetrates the blood-brain barrier and readily enters the CNS parenchyma. Furthermore, FTY720P is detected in situ, suggesting that it may influence the biology of resident cells of the CNS. Our findings reveal that treatment of cultured NPCs with FTY720P led to an active signaling response, as determined by phosphorylation of mitogenactivated protein (MAP) kinase, yet did not influence lineage fate commitment. FTY720 treatment of JHMV-infected mice, transplanted with NPCs, demonstrated enhanced migration associated with increased numbers of NPCs compared with vehicle-treated control animals. FTY720 treatment did not affect the accumulation of T cells or macrophages within the CNS. Finally, after treatment in animals in which demyelination is established, FTY720 did not augment the effects of NPCs on influencing remyelination, indicating a selective effect on migration/proliferation on spinal cord engraftment into JHMV-infected mice.",

Control groups consisted of JHMV-infected mice transplanted with GFP-NPCs treated with vehicle only. Mice were sacrificed at 3 weeks posttransplant, and GFP-NPC distribution was assessed histologically in spinal cord cross sections. In both FTY720 and vehicle-treated control mice, GFP-NPCs were distributed rostral and caudal from the implantation site and colonized areas of demyelination within the ventral funiculus and lateral white matter columns (Figure 3, A and B) . Quantification of GFP-NPCs in defined spinal cord sections rostral and caudal to the implantation site indicated a significant (P < 0.05) increase in numbers of GFP-NPCs in FTY720-treated animals when compared with vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 3C ). Immunostaining for Ki-67 revealed increased numbers of Ki-67epositive GFP-NPCs throughout the spinal cord in FTY720-treated mice, consistent with increased proliferation (Figure 3, D and E) . These findings suggest a role in S1P receptor antagonism in controlling proliferation and/or migration of NPCs engrafted into the spinal cord. We have previously shown that CXCL12 is critical in controlling the positional migration of engrafted NPCs by signaling through CXCR4 expressed on the surface of NPCs. 9 Furthermore, Kimura et al 45 have reported that FTY720 treatment promotes migration of human CD34 \u00fe hematopoietic progenitor cells by enhancing CXCR4 function. Cultured NPCs were treated with increasing concentrations of FTY720P (10 nmol/L, 100 nmol/L, and 1 mmol/L), and the in vitro migration in response to 200 ng/mL recombinant mouse CXCL12 resulted in a dose-dependent migration response ( Figure 4A ). Flow analysis revealed that FTY720 treatment did not affect surface expression of CXCR4 at any concentration tested (Figure 4 , B and C). Therefore, administration of FTY720 enhances migration of NPCs potentially by enhancing CXCR4 function, consistent with earlier studies. 45 FTY720 Treatment of NPC-Transplanted Mice Does Not Affect NPC Differentiation or Demyelination FTY720 did not affect clinical disease in JHMV-infected mice, regardless if transplanted with GFP-NPCs or treated with vehicle (data not shown). We next examined if FTY720 treatment influenced the ability of engrafted NPCs to differentiate into oligodendroglia, because our previous studies have shown that most transplanted cells preferentially differentiate into these cells. 8, 9 By 14 days posttransplant, FTY720 did not affect lineage fate commitment of NPCs because similar frequencies of GST-pepositive cells (a marker for mature myelin-producing oligodendrocytes) were observed in FTY720 versus vehicle-treated mice ( Figure 5, A and B) . The severity of spinal cord demyelination in transplanted mice treated with FTY720 was examined by staining serial coronal sections rostral and caudal to the implantation site with luxol fast blue and quantifying the percentage of white matter damage. 41 ",

Determination of the g-ratio, the ratio of the inner axonal diameter/ the total outer fiber diameter, is an established structural index of remyelination, with lower ratios indicating more extensive remyelination. 42 Regions of spinal cord ventral and lateral white matter tracts of JHMV-infected mice, transplanted with GFP-NPCs and treated with FTY720 or vehicle, and JHMVinfected mice treated with vehicle or FTY720 alone were analyzed ( Figure 6A ). We first determined whether FTY720 treatment alone increased remyelination in JHMV-infected mice. Our findings indicate that, although there was an overall trend toward remyelination after FTY720 treatment compared with control mice, this did not reach significance (Figure 6 , B, C, and F). Increased remyelination was observed in JHMV-infected mice that were transplanted with GFP-NPCs compared with vehicle treatment alone (Figure 6 , B, D, and F). However, FTY720 did not result in a significant increase in remyelination in GFP-NPCetreated animals compared with transplanted animals treated with vehicle alone (Figure 6 , B, E, and F).

Mice were infected intracranially with JHMV, and mice received daily i.p. injections of FTY720 beginning at day 13 p.i. Flow analysis of T-cell infiltration into the spinal cords of infected mice isolated at day 28 p.i. indicated no differences in CD4 \u00fe or CD8 \u00fe T cells within the spinal cords of mice treated with either FTY720 or vehicle alone (Figure 7 , A and B). Moreover, infiltration of virus-specific CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells was not affected after FTY720 treatment (Figure 7, A and B) . Transplantation of GFP-NPCs into JHMV-infected mice did not affect infiltration of total CD4 \u00fe and CD8 \u00fe T cells nor virus-specific T cells into the spinal cord (Figure 7, C and D) , and this is consistent with our previously published studies. 46 Similarly, administration of FTY720 to infected mice transplanted with GFP-NPCs did not prevent total T-cell or virusspecific T-cell entry into the CNS (Figure 7, C and D) . In addition, FTY720 did not affect T-cell infiltration into the brains of mice infected with JHMV alone or transplanted with GFP-NPCs (data not shown). We confirmed the biological activity of FTY720 during chronic disease by examining levels of circulating T cells within the blood. FTY720 significantly (P < 0.05) diminished the frequency of both CD4 \u00fe ( Figure 8A ) and CD8 \u00fe ( Figure 8C ) T cells within the blood compared with control mice. In addition, by using S1P1 eGFP knock-in mice, we determined that surface expression of S1P1, measured by eGFP expression, was also decreased (P < 0.05) on circulating CD4 \u00fe ( Figure 8B ) and CD8 \u00fe T cells ( Figure 8D ) in FTY720-treated mice when compared with control animals. Therefore, FTY720 treatment of JHMV-infected mice results in diminished levels of circulating lymphocytes that correlates with decreased S1P1 expression, and this is consistent with our earlier findings. 41 These results indicate that FTY720 does not affect T-cell migration into the CNS during chronic disease in animals, regardless of whether transplanted with GFP-NPCs or vehicle alone.",

FTY720 treatment did not alter positional migration of transplanted NPCs because these cells efficiently congregated within areas of demyelination ( Figure 3, A and B) . The in vivo migration data support our in vitro experimental results showing that FTY720 treatment of cultured NPCs increases migration after exposure to recombinant mouse CXCL12, and this was independent of elevated surface expression of CXCR4 on NPCs (Figure 4, A and B) . These findings argue that a mechanism underlying enhanced NPC migration could involve an effect on CXCR4 function and/or the downstream signaling cascade, such as calcium mobilization or cytoskeleton rearrangement.",

These findings highlight an important role for S1P signaling in host defense during acute viral-induced neurological disease, most likely by enhancing T cells to efficiently migrate from lymphatic tissue into the CNS. In marked contrast, the present study indicates that when FTY720 treatment is initiated at day 13 p.i. with JHMV, there is no effect on T-cell accumulation within the CNS, and the severity of demyelination is not affected. We believe these differences in outcomes with regard to neuroinflammation reflect the stage of disease at which point FTY720 is administered. As indicated above, FTY720 treatment during acute disease limited egress of virus-specific T cells from draining cervical lymph nodes, thereby reducing the severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination. By day 13 p.i., surviving down-regulates sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) on T cells.

FTY720 significantly diminishes the frequency of both CD4 \u00fe (A) and CD8 \u00fe (C) T cells and S1P1 expression measured by GFP expression on CD4 \u00fe (B) and CD8 \u00fe (D) T cells.

Correspondingly, treatment with FTY720 would have limited-to-no effect on disease progression at this stage of disease because the bulk of virus-specific lymphocytes have already expanded and exited the draining cervical lymph nodes and subsequently infiltrated the CNS. In addition, these data also indicate that T cells do not rely on S1P signaling for T-cell migration to the CNS during chronic disease but rather use other inflammatory signaling cues (eg, chemokines) to gain access to the CNS of JHMV-infected mice. 2, 55 Although FTY720 treatment of cultured NPCs resulted in activation, increased proliferation, and enhanced migration in response to CXCL12, there was no effect on lineage fate commitment because similar frequencies of oligodendroglia, astrocytes, and neurons were observed compared with NPCs treated with control vehicle. Similar frequencies of GFP-positive oligodendroglia expressing GST-p were detected within spinal cords of GFP-NPCetransplanted mice treated with either FTY720 or vehicle control. Although there were increased numbers of GFP-NPCs within areas of demyelination in FTY720-treated mice, we did not observe any discernable increase in remyelination.

            "text": "We have previously shown that engrafted NPCs can remyelinate demyelinated axons, 11 and these findings would argue that FTY720 does not increase the remyelination potential of engrafted NPCs in our model of viralinduced demyelination. This is similar to previous studies that determined that FTY720 does not induce remyelination in either the cuprizone or lysophosphatidyl choline models of demyelination. 56 However, Miron et al 57 have demonstrated that FTY720 treatment resulted in increased remyelination in organotypic cerebral slices where demyelination was induced by lysolecithin. These findings support other studies demonstrating FTY720 treatment in augmenting neurogenesis and repair in models of CNS injury, possibly by activating endogenous NPCs and/or oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. 58e62 We are currently examining whether FTY720 activates endogenous progenitor cells within the CNS of JHMV-infected mice. The conflicting reports on the effects of FTY720 on remyelination highlight differences in model systems used, emphasizing the potential importance of targeting specific receptors for promoting OPC maturation and myelin synthesis. For example, by using a lysophosphatidyl cholineeinduced model of demyelination, administration of S1P5 agonist has been reported to have a greater effect on remyelination compared with S1P1 agonists. 63 FTY720 treatment of MS patients with the relapsingremitting form of disease reduced the risk of disability progression; yet, it is not clear if this is because of an increase in remyelination. 64 The fact that we did not observe any increase in remyelination in JHMV-infected mice treated with FTY720 alone would argue additional studies in preclinical models of MS with more selective S1P receptor agonists or antagonists to better understand the effects on both endogenous glial cells and transplanted NPCs with regard to promoting remyelination.",
