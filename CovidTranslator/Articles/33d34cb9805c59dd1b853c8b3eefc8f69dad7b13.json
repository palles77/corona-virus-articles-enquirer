            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious, acute enteric tract infectious disease of pigs (Sus domesticus) caused by porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). PED is characterized by watery diarrhea, dehydration, weight loss, vomiting and death. PEDV damages pig intestinal epithelial tissue, causing intestinal hyperemia and atrophy of intestinal villi, with formation of intestinal epithelial cell cytoplasmic vacuoles. Since pig small intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) are target cells of PEDV infection, IEC cells were utilized as a model for studying changes in cellular activities post-PEDV infection. Monitoring of Na + -K + -ATPase and Ca 2+ -Mg 2+ -ATPase activities demonstrated that PEDV infection decreased these activities. In addition, IECs proliferation was shown to decrease after PEDV infection using an MTT assay. Moreover, IECs apoptosis detected by flow cytometry with propidium iodide (PI) staining was clearly shown to increase relative to the control group. Meanwhile, animal experiments indicated that PEDV virulence for IEC cells was greater than viral virulence for Vero cells, although this may be due to viral attenuation after numerous passages in the latter cell line. Collectively, these studies revealed viral pathogenic mechanisms in PEDV-infected IECs and offer a theoretical basis for PEDV prevention and control.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is the etiologic agent that causes porcine epidemic diarrhea. This virus was first discovered in England in 1971 and was later identified as a member of Coronaviridae [1, 2] . PEDV causes severe diarrhea and dehydration, resulting in 100% morbidity and roughly 80% to 100% mortality in piglets [3] [4] [5] . Although great progress has been made in molecular epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of PEDV [6, 7] , frequencies of outbreaks of this virus continue to rise, causing problems for the swine industry and for international trade. Indeed, outbreaks in the US and other countries have been caused by virus variants that are very similar to the Chinese AH2012 strain [8, 9] , suggesting that global transmission is already underway. Very few cell lines or primary cells have been found to support PEDV replication. Subsequently, most research on this virus has been conducted using Vero and Marc-145 cell lines, which are derived from cells originally isolated from monkey kidney [10] . These cell lines greatly differ from the natural host of PEDV replication, porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). A model to investigate the interaction between porcine small intestinal epithelial cells and PEDV is badly needed to increase understanding of viral molecular mechanisms underlying virulence, pathogenesis and disease treatment. Recent study showed that IPEC-J2 from DSMZ (No: ACC701) and IECs from China can be infected with PEDV [11, 12] , but still little is known about the interaction between porcine IECs and PEDV.",

After two days post-infection, two piglets in group 1 died after exhibiting severe watery diarrhea, while the remaining infected piglets in the group exhibited typical fluidic diarrhea. The intestinal tract morphologies of nine piglets were analyzed after necropsy (Fig 4) . The intestinal tracts of six piglets in group 1 and group 2 were typically distended with yellow watery contents. Clinical symptoms were more obvious and serious in group 1 than in group 2. Meanwhile, piglets in the control group were normal (Fig 4C) . The results from HE staining demonstrated significant destruction of cells in infected piglets' intestinal tracts (Fig 5) . Pathological symptoms in group 1 were more serious than in group 2 with regard to serious atrophy of mucosal villi, hyperemia of mucosal lamina propria and presence of red blood cells in the lumen. In group 2, the mucosal villi atrophied and the mucosal lamina propria exhibited hyperemia with no red blood cells in the lumen. Meanwhile, control group samples showed healthy villi structures with the orderly arrangement of chorionic epithelial cells. HE staining revealed that villus length and V/C ratio were all markedly reduced, exhibiting significant differences relative to normal tissue features (P < 0.05); meanwhile mucosal thickness increased in the experiment group and led to lower level generation of small intestinal epithelial cells and reduction of small intestinal secretory function (Table 4 ). According to observations of clinical symptoms and results of necropsies and HE assays of infected piglets, it was concluded that virus virulence of IECs was greater than virulence of virus harvested from Vero cells.
