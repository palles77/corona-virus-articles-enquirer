Developing high titers of anti-SARS hyperimmune globulin to provide an alternative pathway for emergent future prevention and treatment of SARS. Methods: SARS coronavirus (CoV)F69 (AY313906) and Z2-Y3 (AY394989) were isolated and identified from 2 different Cantonese onset SARS patients. Immunogen was prepared from SARS-CoV F69 strain. Six health horses were immunized 4 times and serum was collected periodically to measure the profile of specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies using indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a microneutralization test. Sera were collected in large amounts at the peak, where IgG was precipitated using ammonium sulphate and subsequently digested with pepsin. The product was then purified using anion-exchange chromatography to obtain F(ab') 2 fragments. Results: The specific IgG and neutralizing antibody titers peaked at approximately week 7 after the first immunization, with a maximum value of 1:14210. The sera collected at the peak were then purified. Fragment of approximately 15 g F(ab') 2 was obtained from 1 litre antiserum and the purity was above 90% with the titer of 1:5120, which could neutralize the other strain (SARS-CoV Z2-Y3) as well. Conclusion: This research provides a viable strategy for the prevention and treatment of SARS coronavirus infection with equine hyperimmune globulin, with the purpose of combating any resurgence of SARS.",

Until an effective vaccine is developed, the best hope for the treatment of infection and the prevention and control of future outbreaks is the development of passive immunotherapy with SARS-CoVspecific antibodies [11] . Immunoglobulin is an effective method used in protection against animal coronavirus: transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [12, 13] , mouse hepatitis virus [14] , and bovine coronavirus [15] . There is clinical evidence that serum from recovered patients is effective in infected individuals [16, 17] . These observations suggest that hyperimmune serum could be developed for the passive treatment of SARS. The use of equine antisera for emergent prevention and treatment of infectious diseases has been proven to be an effective and safe strategy, such as in rabies virus [18, 19] . Therefore, immunoprophylaxis and treatment of SARS coronavirus infection with equine hyperimmune globulin might be a viable strategy for controlling SARS.",

To avoid the side-effects caused by horse antiserum, IgG against SARS-CoV was digested with pepsin and purified with anion-exchange separations to exclude the immunogenicity of Fc fragments and to retain the special activity of binding the antigen of F(ab') 2 fraction. The titers of neutralizing F(ab') 2 against SARS-CoV was detected at higher level (1:5120). And approximately 15 g F(ab') 2 fragments were obtained from 1 litre antiserum, with the purity above 90%.",

In this article, we provide an alternative pathway of prevention and treatment of SARS, with the purpose of combating any resurgence of SARS. The profile of the antibody titer was observed, while an effective, specific and neutralizing hyperimmunoglobulin was prepared. The results indicate that the kinetics of the induced specific IgG and neutralizing antibodies are similar ( Figure 4 ). This data paves the way for the development of an inactivated SARS vaccine. ",
