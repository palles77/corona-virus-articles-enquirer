It is widely accepted that CoV human transmission is driven by the interactions of its spike protein (S-protein) with human receptor on host cell surface; so, quantitative evaluation of these interactions may be used to assess the human transmission capability of CoVs. However, quantitative methods directly using viral genome data are still lacking. Here, we perform large-scale protein-protein docking to quantify the interactions of 2019-nCoV S-protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) with human receptor ACE2, based on experimental SARS-CoV S-RBD-ACE2 complex structure. By sampling a large number of thermodynamically probable binding conformations with Monte Carlo algorithm, this approach successfully identified the experimental complex structure as the lowest-energy receptor-binding conformations, and hence established an experiment-based strength reference for evaluating the receptor-binding affinity of 2019-nCoV via comparison with SARS-CoV. Our results show that this",

Although its original host remains unknown, all available data point again to a wild animal source. And, it is evident that human-to-human transmission is causing the rapid spreading of this newly emerged virus. Viral strains from infected persons of the area have been sequenced; but only little genetic variation was found, implying that they are descended from a common ancestor (Rambaut, 2020) . Full-length genome analysis of 2019-nCoV patient samples revealed 79.5% and 96% sequence identities to SARS-CoV and a bat SARSr-Cov (severe acute respiratory syndrome-related CoV), respectively; however, sequences of the seven conserved viral replicase domains in ORF1ab show 94.6% identity between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV .",

The host cell receptors differ among human CoVs: SARS-CoV binds to exopeptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2005; Li et al., 2003) , and MERS-CoV to dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP4) (Raj et al., 2013) ; other CoVs such as HCoV-HKU1 use O-acetylated sialic acid as a receptor (Huang et al., 2015) .",

Such a comparison assessment avoids using the calculated, absolute free-energy scores to correlate with the binding strength, which might systematically differ from the actual measurement values because of the intrinsic, theoretical approximations of the used Rosetta all-atom energy function (Alford et al., 2017) . We want to point out that all the docking simulations for SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV use the same protocols and a consistent all-atom energy function.

Sometimes, it might be even impossible to employ experimental methods to thoroughly examine every evolved, mutant strain of a newly emerged virus, such as 2019-nCoV in our case. As an alternative, using a high-performance computer, our approach may assess the receptor-binding capability of a newly identified strain within a very short period of time. Thus, our method can be useful for the post-genome analysis for a newly identified CoV and its mutant strains, with the first-determined genome data. Note that, although viral genome data provide useful sequence information for comparison-based assessments with previously identified viruses, these data themselves do not offer hints about how the encoded viral proteins carry out their functions which may lead to serious human infections and diseases.

The docking program of Rosetta (Das and Baker, 2008) was used to carry out the local protein-protein docking with the starting conformation of a given S-RBD-ACE2 complex. The Rosetta energy function 2015 (REF15) was employed in the docking to evaluate the interaction energy of two docking components (i.e., S-RBD and ACE2). For each S-RBD-ACE2 pair, at least 3,000 independent docking simulations were performed to generate a large number of thermodynamically probable, low-energy binding conformations for calculating the binding freeenergy. The top-scoring, lowest-energy conformations were identified as the native-like conformations of the S-RBD binding to ACE2. The local protein-protein docking protocols are: ",
