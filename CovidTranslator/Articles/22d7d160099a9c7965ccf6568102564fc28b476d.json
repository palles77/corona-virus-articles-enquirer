The increasing efforts to use ingredients that are as natural as possible in the formulation of innovative products has given rise to the introduction of macro and microalgae in food industry. To date, scarce information has been published about algae ingredients as antimicrobials in food. The antimicrobial potential of algae is highly dependent on: (i) type, brown algae being the most effective against foodborne bacteria; (ii) the solvent used in the extraction of bioactive compounds, ethanolic and methanolic extracts being highly effective against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; and (iii) the concentration of the extract. The present paper reviews the main antimicrobial potential of algal species and their bioactive compounds in reference and real food matrices. The validation of the algae antimicrobial potential in real food matrices is still a research niche, being meat and bakery products the most studied substrates.",

Given that oceans cover three quarters of the Earth's surface, these marine organisms are of potential interest not only as ingredients for the production of food but also as practical and necessary metabolites with medical and technological properties, such as lipids, enzymes, biomass, polymers, toxins, pigments, and clean fuel, which can be produced, concentrated, and successfully isolated from these small but efficient ''marine bioreactors\". These organisms are a viable and economical source for the production of these substances, and are in great demand in the nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, chemical, food, and cosmetic industries because of their moisturizing, antioxidant, and regenerative properties (Batista, Gouveia, Bandarra, Franco, & Raymundo, 2013; Devi, Suganthy, Kesika, & Pandian, 2008; Rani, Singh, & Maheshwari, 2013) .

The algae group is divided into multicellular organisms, MACROALGAE or seaweed, and unicellular organisms, known as MICROALGAE (measuring from 1 mm to several cm). Macroalgae are often fastgrowing, reaching sizes of up to 60 m in length. A standard classification has been established, dividing seaweed organisms into three groups on the basis of their pigmentation: i) brown seaweed (Phaeophyceae); ii) red seaweed (Rhodophyceae) and iii) green seaweed (Chlorophyceae). Seaweeds are mainly used for the production of food and the extraction of hydrocolloids. On the other hand, microalgae are microscopic bodies that normally grow in suspension, some with features characteristic of bacteria. These algae grow in seawater, in the region where light penetrates (photic zone), basically up to a depth of 200 meters. Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae), green algae (Chlorophyceae), and golden algae (Chrysophyceae) are the most important microalgae in terms of abundance, but blue-green algae (Cyanophyceae) are also classified as microalgae (e.g. Spirulina) .",

France, Ireland, Canada, and the United States are particularly active in introducing seaweed into local cuisine, and the movement is spreading to cookery books that include recipes with algae as the main ingredient (FAO, 2012) . Consumers have a good perception of algae as ''natural products\", like lettuce, chard, or broccoli, with well-known, accepted health benefits (Honkanen, 2009) . Humans have certainly been consuming algae for years: pet foods, baby foods, dairy products, instant soups, meat coatings (cooked ham), and many others commodities are clear examples of the presence of seaweed in our daily diet.

            "text": "The recent year 2014 was designated as ''Protein Year\", underlining the importance of finding alternative sources of these valuable molecules, proteins of animal and vegetable origin. In this field, algae take a high position among the raw materials proposed as alternative protein sources, together with soy, beans, grains, and, recently, insects . Algae protein quality has been considered superior to that of other plant sources, such as wheat, rice, or beans, but poorer than that of animal protein sources, such as milk or meat (Mendes, Lopes da Silva, & Reis, 2007) . However, interest in marine proteins might be directly correlated not only with intact protein but also with the possibility of generating bioactive peptides. Small peptides are generally considered to be the most ancient antimicrobial agents because of their ubiquity and simple molecular structure. In general, bioactive peptides comprise relatively small molecules (<10 kDa, or 12-50 amino acids) that do not present any bioactivity prior to being released from the intact parent protein. However, in various processes such as digestion or in vivo hydrolysis, or as a result of application of technological treatments such as high pressure processing, these peptides demonstrate many physiological functions, including antioxidant, antihypertensive or ACE inhibition, anticoagulant, and antimicrobial properties (Ngo, Wijesekara, Vo, Ta, & Kim, 2011) . Antimicrobial peptides are recognized as being divided into three groups: (i) linear a-helical peptides; (ii) cysteine-rich peptides; (iii) certain amino-acid-enriched peptides. Critical factors affecting the antibacterial activity and modes of action of antimicrobial peptides are size, charge, conformation/secondary structure, hydrophobicity, and origin (animal/plant or marine) (Aneiros & Garateix, 2004) .",

Phaeophyta, or brown algae, are specifically rich in polysaccharides, including alginates, laminarins, fucans, and cellulose. Chlorophyta, or green algae, are mainly composed of ulvan. The principal polysaccharides found in Rhodophyta, or red algae, are agars and carrageenans. These polysaccharides obtained from algae have been related to positive effects on gut microbiota, acting as prebiotics, a prebiotic being a ''selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or in the activity of the gastrointestinal microflora, that confers benefits upon host well-being and health\". Reduction of enteric infections in pigs and cattle is possible by means of administration of prebiotic compounds in the diet which promote the activity and proliferation of beneficial gastrointestinal microflora to the detriment of pathogenic bacteria (Uyeno, Shigemori, & Shimosato, 2015) . The use of marine algal prebiotics as sources to control and reduce pathogenic bacteria and to improve animal and human health is another possibility that this line of research offers (Promya & Chitmanat, 2011) . The polysaccharide ulvan is easily extracted from Ulva rigida, and could be hydrolyzed to produce bioactive oligosaccharides (Mi\u0161urcov\u00e1, \u0160krov\u00e1nkov\u00e1, Samek, Ambro\u017eov\u00e1, & Mach\u016f , 2012) .

Additionally, some operations such as ultrafiltration processes are added to enhance selectivity. Other methods use ethanol in a first step to precipitate protein, followed by a second stage extraction with hexane, butanol, or ethyl acetate. Recent studies show that it is possible to use ternary mixtures of solvents (ethanol-hexane-water [77:17:6]) to form a homogeneous solution, with the advantage of significantly increasing the extraction yield and purity of the compounds extracted by a single stage, based on the high solubility of the compounds in the extractant mixture (Parniakov et al., 2015) . The antimicrobial potential of algae extracts is dependent on the capability of the solvent to extract certain bioactive compounds, and also dependent on the sensitiveness of bacteria or fungi to these selective extracted compounds (Al-Saif et al., 2014; Cakmak et al., 2014) . In general, these traditional extraction techniques, such as Soxhlet, solid-liquid extraction (SLE), or liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), are time-consuming procedures that use high volumes of solvents and obtain low extraction yields.",

Manivannan et al. (2011) tested the brown seaweeds Turbinaria conoides and Padina gymnospora for their antimicrobial potential against S. aureus. S. aureus proved to be more resistant to T. conoides extracts (3-15 mm inhibition zone), but was more sensitive to P. gymnospora (10-16 mm inhibition zone). Methanol and ethyl acetate extracts of T. conoides were the two most inhibitory ones against S. aureus. However, when growing S. aureus cells were exposed to P. gymnospora, diethyl ether and acetone were the extracts that inhibited cellular proliferation most effectively. Methanolic and ethanolic extracts of Dunaliella salina showed the lowest MBC against S. aureus (1.25 mg/mL) compared with other solvent extracts, such as hexane (MBC = 10 mg/mL) (Cakmak et al., 2014) .",

This antimicrobial capabiity was not detected when the same fresh alga material was extracted with ethanol solvent. This led the researchers to the conclusion that some active compounds responsible for the antimicrobial potential against S. aureus are effectively extracted in diethyl ether, which produces larger halo zones than methanol, acetone, and ethanol, in which antimicrobial compounds are not completely dissolved and extracted. Among the most effective antimicrobial compounds found in these algal species are terpenes, (e.g. usneoidone E, zosterdiol A, zosterdiol B, zosteronol, and zosteronediol) responsible for the antimicrobial and antiviral activity attributed to them (Plaza del Moral & Rodr\u00edguez-Meizoso, 2013).",

Moreover, according to the studies of Wang et al.

In 2009 they published a new research work in which the bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects of PTs from A. nodosum were evaluated against E. coli O157:H7, and were then compared with the antimicrobial potential of other tannins from terrestrial plant sources. An MIC of 25 mg/mL was required to inhibit growth of E. coli O157:H7 strains (EDL933 and E318 N) for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. PT bacteriostatic concentrations of 25 lg/mL or higher, and a bactericidal concentration ! 50 lg/mL, were required against the E. coli O157:H7 strains studied. According to Ngo et al.

It can be concluded that H. tuna extracts were very effective against A. niger, A. flavus, A. alternaria, C. albicans, and E. floccosum, and the methanol extract was the most effective one against fungi. Salem et al. (2014) studied the antimicrobial potential of Nostoc spp., Microcystis spp., Scenedesmus spp., Oscillatoria geminata, and Chlorella vulgaris algal strains against several food bacteria, including Aspergillus niger. Dried algal biomass was sonicated and extracted with 95% methanol and 95% acetone. Extracts were prepared in DMSO for evaluation of antimicrobial activity. Algal extracts from Nostoc spp., Microcystis spp., Scenedesmus spp., and Oscillatoria geminata revealed antifungal activity, and the methanol extract of Nostoc (50 mg/mL) was the most effective one against A. niger, with an inhibition zone diameter of 22 mm. Acetone extract was also effective against A. niger (30 mg/mL), with a 21 mm inhibition zone diameter. An acetone extract of T. conoides also exerted a mild antimicrobial capability against A. niger, with an inhibition zone diameter close to 3 mm (Manivannan et al., 2011) . Extracts of Trichodesmium erythraeum (hexane and ethyl acetate 5 mg/disc) were also effective against A. niger and A. flavus. In a comparison of the hexane and ethyl acetate extracts, the latter had a higher antifungal potential than the hexane algal extract. Ethyl acetate extract of T. erythraeum inhibited growth of A. niger and A. flavus at 1000 mg/mL (Thillairajasekar, Duraipandiyan, Perumal, & Ignacimuthu, 2009) . Both extracts are rich in myristic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. There is an established relationship between the richness in polyunsaturated fatty acids (lauric, palmitic, linoleic, linolenic, stearic, and myristic) of algal extracts and the antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal potential exerted by them (El Shoubaky & El Rahman-Salem, 2014) .",

Algae polysaccharides have exerted also anti-viral potential against rotaviruses. These viral agents are the most important causing gastroenteritis, mainly in children, with fatal consequences. The effect of sulfated polysaccharides interfering with the adsorption process of enveloped viruses has been considered in the invention developed by Anderson, Schaller, Mazer, and Kirchner (1997) to demonstrate that carrageenan, and particularly k-carrageenan, is an effective inhibitor of rotavirus infection in animal cells. Crude metanol extract (70% v/v) of Spirulina platensis also showed antiviral activity with 56.7%, inhibition rate against rotavirus Wa strain (Hetta et al., 2014) . According to the studies of Hetta et al.

Although some researchers are making efforts to introduce raw algae and processed materials in the formulation of innovative meat-derived products (e.g. sausages and hamburgers), some aspects such as quality and organoleptic acceptance of the final formulation still need to be analyzed in depth. With regard to the validation of the antimicrobial potential of algae in meat products, a noteworthy study has recently been published by S\u0203l\u0203gean et al. (2015) . Among the main advantages that the introduction of algae in meat-formulated products aims at are the following: (a) the introduction of a protein source of vegetable origin, (b) lower content of cholesterol, calories and fat in the finished products, and the associated (c) beneficial bioactive compounds present in algae-derived ingredients. According to the results obtained by S\u0203l\u0203gean et al. (2015) , in the formulation of half-smoked sausages (75% first-quality beef, [10-15]% animal fat, and brown algae [10-15]%) the addition of algae in the formulation led to a final product with higher quality (physicochemical and organoleptic), with improved functionality resulting from the antimicrobial potential of brown algae against S. aureus and E. coli (storage 7 days, 10-12\u00b0C). Furthermore, a recent industrial patent has been obtained for the introduction of algae in meatderived products. According to Cofrades et al. (2011) , a new method for the formulation of healthier meat products has been developed, incorporating less than 5 wt.% of Himanhatalia elongata brown alga. Brown algae are more suitable for meat formulations than red or green algae, not only because of their nutritional profile but also because of the color balance between animal tissue (cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, poultry) and these pigmented algae. The result shows a reduction in sodium levels and an improvement in the lipid profile of the final product (Cofrades et al., 2011) .",

According to S\u00e1nchez-Ortega et al. (2014) , the addition of edible algae films and coatings on meat products had the following main advantages: reduction of lipid oxidation, increase in stability of red meat color, prevention of moisture loss, reduction of spoilage and pathogenic microorganism load, and partial inactivation of deteriorative proteolytic enzymes on the surface of the coated meat. The development of red algae films applied to bacon impacted positively on the microbiological quality of the product reducing E. coli O157:H7 by 0.45 log CFU/g and L. monocytogenes by 0.76 CFU/g with respect to the controls. The application of edible coatings from algae to cheese also reduced E. coli O157:H7 and L. monocytogenes populations by 1.21 and 0.85 log CFU/g, respectively, compared with the control after 15 days of storage (Shin, Song, Seo, & Song, 2012; S\u00e1nchez-Ortega et al., 2014) . Other algae derivatives such as alginate and j-carrageenan have also been used in the formulation of edible films with antimicrobial properties against L. monocytogenes, e.g. in cold smoked salmon (Neetoo, Ye, & Chen, 2010) .",

However, some contradictions can be found in the literature as a result of the different strains used in the determination of antimicrobial activity, different methods of extraction applied, and different ranges of alga material concentration used in the assays. The promising results of bacterial growth inhibition and inactivation by raw and purified algal compounds, and the lack of studies carried out in real food matrices open a research niche with high application at food industrial level. A valuable relationship could be established between the antioxidant potential of algae and their antimicrobial capability. Consequently, the twofold use of algae extracts as antioxidants and antimicrobials in food products has good prospects in response to the Horizon 2020 call for white label developments and innovation in sustainable food products that are as natural as possible.",
