            "text": "The fidelity of the poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D pol ) plays a direct role in the genomic evolution and pathogenesis of the virus. A single site mutation (Gly64Ser) that is remote from the catalytic center results in a higher fidelity polymerase. NMR studies with [methyl-13 C]methionine-labeled protein were used to compare the solution structure and dynamics of wild-type and Gly64Ser 3D pol . The chemical shifts for the Met6 resonance were significantly different between wild-type and Gly64Ser 3D pol when bound in ternary complexes with RNA and incorrect, but not with correct, nucleotide, suggesting that the Gly64Ser mutation induces structural changes in the N-terminal \u03b2-strand when the enzyme is bound to incorrect, but not correct nucleotide. We also observe changes in the transverse relaxation times for methionines near regions important for nucleotide and RNA binding, and catalysis. Our strategy to assign the [methyl-13 C]methionine resonances involved separately mutating each of the seventeen methionines. Several substitutions produced additional resonances for both Met6 and Met187, a reporter for RNA binding and conformational changes in the highly conserved motif B loop, even though these methionines are greater than 20 \u00c5 apart. The results for Gly64Ser and the other mutants are intriguing considering that they can result in structural and/or dynamic changes to methionines distant from the site of mutation. We propose that there is a long-distance network operating throughout 3D pol that coordinates ligand binding, conformational changes and catalysis. Mutation of Gly64 results in structural and/or dynamic changes to the network that may affect polymerase fidelity.",

The polymerase from poliovirus (PV) has emerged as an important model system for understanding the function of 3D pol enzymes (5) . Intriguingly, the error frequency or 'fidelity' of PV 3D pol appears to be very important to the biology and pathogenesis of poliovirus. For example, restriction of genetic variability within a population of poliovirus through expression of a mutant high fidelity 3D pol leads to lower tissue adaptability and viral pathogenicity (6) (7) (8) (9) . This suggests that understanding the function and fidelity mechanisms of 3D pol has a direct bearing on disease intervention. Antiviral strategies may include targeting 3D pol by small molecules to inhibit its activity and/or change its fidelity (10) (11) (12) (13) , or alternatively, virus encoding 3D pol enzymes with altered fidelity may be potentially used as live, attenuated vaccine strains (7, 14) .",

Phosphodiester formation occurs to yield the ternary product complex (*E:R n+1 PP i ) that then undergoes another conformational change (E:R n+1 PP i ), followed by the release of pyrophosphate (E:R n+1 ) (22, 23) . In PV 3D pol , the conformational change step prior to phosphoryl transfer and the phosphoryl transfer step itself are both partially rate limiting (22, 23) . Thus, correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation can be distinguished by kinetic differences in both of these steps.",

However, there is some controversy concerning the nature of the conformational change (16, 25) . It has been suggested that in some nucleic acid polymerases, the conformational change is a global 'open-closed' conformational change (16) , but in 3D pol , the conformational change step is likely to be more localized and traced to structural changes of motifs A and B (22, 23) . For instance, the interaction between Asp238 and Asn297 observed in the unliganded enzyme occludes the ribose-binding pocket, and consequently, there must be a conformational change involving residues in motifs A and B in order for nucleotide to bind (19) . Further structural changes involving Asp238, Asn297 and other residues in motif B such as Ser288 and Thr293 are also predicted to occur in order for the triphosphate group to align for catalysis (19, 22, 23) . This suggestion is in agreement with crystal structures of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 3D pol that show localized structural changes to motifs A and B upon formation of the ternary complex with RNA and nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) (26) . The highly conserved loop in motif B in FMDV 3D pol (\u03b210-\u03b113 loop according to PV numbering and containing residues 285-293, \u03b29-\u03b111 loop according to FMDV) changes conformation to accommodate different nucleotides and RNA (26) . The conformational change may also involve structural rearrangements in motif D to bring Lys359 into a position where it can act as a general acid to protonate the pyrophosphate leaving group (27, 28) .",

For example, mutation of the highly conserved Gly64 present on the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop (containing residues 61-71) in the fingers domain to Ser results in a higher fidelity polymerase. The rate of correct nucleotide incorporation is ~6000 fold greater than incorrect nucleotide incorporation for wild-type 3D pol , whereas for Gly64Ser 3D pol , correct nucleotide incorporation is ~9000 fold greater than incorrect nucleotide incorporation (i.e. the fidelity of Gly64Ser 3D pol is ~1.5 fold greater than wild-type 3D pol ) (6) . Thus, for Gly64Ser 3D pol , nucleotide incorporation is more stringent, and this leads to a lower errorrate and decreased diversity within the viral population (6, 7) . The differences in fidelity are not due to differences in nucleotide binding or to the rates of phosphodiester formation, but rather appear to be due to alterations in the conformational change step that brings the enzyme into an active conformation (6) .",

This suggests that mutation of Gly64 to Ser may result in structural changes to the N-terminal \u03b2-strand, motif A and/or the \u03b210-\u03b113 loop. However, comparison of the X-ray crystal structure of the unliganded forms of wild-type (WT) and Gly64Ser 3D pol did not show any significant structural differences in these regions (29) . The crystal structures of WT and Gly64Ser 3D pol overlapped to a great extent (rmsd= 0.28 \u00c5 for the protein backbone) and there were no obvious structural differences that pointed towards changes in function and/or fidelity (29, 30) . These results prompted the suggestion that the functional differences may arise not because of structural changes but due to differences in the internal protein motions between WT and Gly64Ser 3D pol (29, 30) . However, it should be noted that structural differences might only become apparent when the enzymes are bound to RNA and/or form ternary complexes competent for phosphodiester formation. Unfortunately, there are currently no available structures of WT or Gly64Ser PV 3D pol bound with RNA that would shed more insight.",

However, there are now a number of established strategies to study larger proteins by NMR (31, 32) , including TROSY (transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy)-based methods to study both backbone amide groups and side-chain methyl groups (33) . In our case, we have isotopically labeled the terminal methyl groups of the methionine residues in the protein. This allowed us to quickly adapt existing protein expression and purification procedures for isotope labeling (34) . During our studies, we identified a complex, long distance interaction network operating throughout 3D pol that might be responsible for coordinating nucleotide and nucleic acid binding and catalysis. Moreover, the Gly64Ser mutation results in structural and/or dynamic changes to residues on this network. Further delineation of this amino acid network will bring new insights into the fidelity and function of PV 3D pol and related polymerases, and can be used as leverage in rational viral vaccine and/or inhibitor design.",

It should be noted that the overexpression and purification procedure yields 3D pol with the correct amino acid (i.e. glycine) at position 1 rather than a methionine (36) . It has been previously observed that mutations at the amino terminus results in enzymes with altered enzyme kinetics, due in part to structural pertubations to Asp238 that is responsible for properly positioning the incoming nucleotide (36, 45) . To assign the resonances in the 1 H-13 C HSQC spectrum of [methyl-13 C]methionine-labeled 3D pol (Figure 2 ), we generated mutants in which each methionine residue was substituted with an isoleucine residue (or leucine in the case of Met123Leu). Most of the site mutants resulted in the elimination of a single resonance, allowing for straightforward assignment of all 15 resonances observed for the WT spectrum ( Figure 2A ). Met286Ile and Met299Ile mutations did not result in the elimination of any resonances, although they did result in some chemical shift changes (Supporting Information  Table S2 ). Both methionine residues belong to motif B and are in close structural vicinity to each other. Mutation of the other methionines did not reveal any other peaks that might be obscured in the WT spectrum. This suggests that the peak intensities for Met286 and Met299 are quite low compared to the other methionines. It should also be noted that binding of RNA and/or nucleotide did not result in any new resonances that might be ascribed to Met286 or Met299.",

It has been previously observed that 3D pol can use Co 2+ cofactor for catalysis (35) . Addition of Mg 2+ had little effect on the 3D pol spectrum, other than a small chemical shift change to Met6 (data not shown), but addition of the paramagnetic ion Co 2+ resulted in chemical shift changes for Met225, Met323, Met392 and Met394, with smaller chemical shift changes for Met74 and Met354 ( Figure 2B ). These findings are consistent with the resonance assignments of the methionines. Met225, Met323 and Met354 are all located in the palm region of 3D pol (Supporting Information Table S1 ), and are relatively near the metal binding sites (12-16 \u00c5) compared to most of the other methionines (> 25 \u00c5). Met392 is also relatively close to the metal binding site, although the orientation of Met394 results in its \u03b2-methyl group being ~20-21 \u00c5 from the metal binding sites. Movement of Met394 or structural changes within the thumb domain may bring Met394 into closer proximity to the metal binding sites. Unfortunately, direct comparison between methionines is problematic considering that the pseudocontact shift resulting from the paramagnetic ion has an angular dependence (46, 47) , which is different for each of the effected methionines.",

The peak intensity generally correlated with the solvent accessibility of the methyl probe, as has been previously observed in the DNA damage recognition protein UvrB (48) . This makes intuitive sense considering that more solvent exposed residues should be less motionally restricted, leading to longer transverse relaxation times (T 2 ) and more intense peaks (48) . Of course, one major caveat to this analysis is that exchange broadening can significantly reduce the peak intensities. The Met6 resonance has a much lower signal intensity than what would be expected, suggesting that Met6 might be experiencing exchange broadening, which is consistent with our R 2 relaxation dispersion experiments (see below). The more solvent-exposed methionines, Met86, Met123, Met189, Met251 and Met392, also have chemical shifts closer to that of free methionine.",

An even more dramatic example is the Met74Ile mutation that results in a chemical shift change to the Met95 resonance, despite the \u03b1-carbons of these amino acids being ~30 \u00c5 apart. Figure 2C , also see Supporting Information Table S2 ). Mutations leading to this behavior are found throughout 3D pol , including amino acid positions in the fingers (i.e. Met74, Met86, Met95, Met141, Met189, Met251) and palm (i.e. Met323 and Met354) regions of the enzyme. Some of the mutations are near Met187 (e.g. Met95, Met189), but the mutations are all distant (> 25 \u00c5) from Met6. Intriguingly, the methionine mutations result in similar behavior to both the Met6 and Met187 resonances, that is, whenever there is chemical shift change, or the appearance of two resonances for Met6, there is a corresponding change for Met187. Moreover, the peak ratios between the \"major\" and \"minor\" resonances of Met6 and Met187 are very similar for all the mutants that show two sets of resonances for Met6 and Met187 (Supporting Information Table S5 ).

Gly64 makes hydrogen bond interactions with Gly1 on the N-terminal \u03b2-strand that includes Met6 ( Figure 1B) .

However, it should be noted that the Nterminal \u03b2-strands of WT and Gly64Ser 3D pol essentially overlap in the crystal structures (rmsd = 0.45 \u00c5 for C \u03b1 ), and the orientation of the side-chain for Met6 is identical between WT and Gly64Ser 3D pol .

Instead, we focused on a qualitative comparison between WT and Gly64Ser 3D pol to guage any differences in their internal protein dynamics that may be related to their functional differences ( Figure 5 ).",

Together, the results with the methionine mutants and the relaxation data suggest that there is an exchange process involving the conformations of Met6 and Met187, and it is likely that the methionine mutants disturb this conformational equilibrium. Some insight into the conformational equilibrium can be gained by comparing the spectra of methionine mutant 3D pol (e.g. Met251Ile) with wild-type 3D pol in the unliganded and RNA-bound states (Supporting Information Figure S4 , Tables S2, S6). The second Met187 resonance for Met251Ile 3D pol (and other methionine mutants that show this behavior) is near the Met187 resonance when WT 3D pol is bound to RNA. This suggests that the second conformation for Met187, and the surrounding region, might be involved in the RNA binding mechanism of 3D pol . If the structural differences are assumed to be similar between the exchanging conformations in WT and Gly64Ser 3D pol (i.e. the chemical shift difference between the exchanging conformations are similar), the increased R ex values for Gly64Ser 3D pol may be due to a change in the exchange kinetics or change in the relative populations of the exchanging conformers. Kinetic data comparing the rates of formation of the RNA binding complexes between WT and methionine mutant 3D pol would likely shed more insight into this conformational exchange process and its role (if any) in RNA recognition and/or binding. These studies can also be accompanied with R 2 relaxation dispersion studies with other probes (e.g. Val, Leu, Ile) that might be more amenable to this larger protein system (32), as has been performed with the bacteriophage \u03c66 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (53) .",

One motivation for this study was to gain more insight into the effect of the Gly64Ser mutation on the structure and/or conformational dynamics of 3D pol . Our studies indicate that the Gly64Ser mutation not only affects the conformational environment of those methionines (Met6 and Met74) closest to the site of mutation, but it can have long range effects on the dynamics of distant amino acid residues. For example, the Gly64Ser mutation can lead to changes to the ps-ns timescale dynamics of Met95 and the \u03bcs-ms timescale dynamics of Met187 and Met189, at least in the unliganded enzyme. Close inspection of the 3D pol structure suggests potential path(s) through which changes to Gly64 may affect Met95, Met187 and Met189. Met187 makes van der Waals contact with Ser291 on the highly conserved \u03b210-\u03b113 loop in motif B (Figure 6 ). The other end of the loop is involved in a hydrogen bond network involving the N-terminal \u03b2-strand, Gly64 and motif A ( Figure 1B) . The \u03b210-\u03b113 loop, including Ser288 and Thr293, is intimately involved in the conformational change that is predicted to reorient the triphosphates of the incoming nucleotide (19, 22, 23, 26) . A change in the structure and/or dynamics of the loop would help to both explain the effect that Gly64Ser has on the kinetics of the conformational change step and the resulting effect on the dynamics of Met95, Met187 and Met189. A similar conclusion has been recently drawn from crystal structures of FMDV 3D pol . The equivalent Gly64Ser mutation in FMDV 3D pol (Gly62Ser) results in a structural change to the motif B loop resulting in significant changes to the RNA binding-mode (54) . The authors also note extensive hydrogen bond interactions between the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop, the N-terminal \u03b2-strand, and motifs A and B that would be able to transmit changes from Gly64 to the active-site (54) . Unfortunately, we were unable to observe a resonance for Met286 that is on the \u03b210-\u03b113 loop that might have revealed additional information about changes to the structure and/or dynamics of the loop upon mutation of Gly64.",

As stated, although Met6 and Met187 are distant from one another, they appear to be conformationally coupled. Changes to Met6 (or Met187) may be transmitted through a similar network of interactions as suggested for Gly64Ser, considering that Met6 is on the N-terminal \u03b2-strand that is involved in the hydrogen bonding network between motifs A, B and Gly64. Mutations to methionines that are interacting with structural elements containing Met6 or Met187 may induce changes along this long-range network to affect the resonances of both Met6 and Met187. For example, the Met95Ile and Met189Ile mutations induce changes to both Met6 and Met187, likely due to their close interactions with Met187. Likewise, Met141 makes contact with residues (e.g. Leu181, Asn182, Val185) on the \u03b1helix containing Met187. Met323 in motif C interacts with residues in the motif B helix (e.g. Asn 301, Asn302, Ile305, Arg306) that can in turn affect the motif B loop and the Met6/ Met187 resonances. Met74 and Met251 make contact with residues in the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop (e.g. Val70), and other residues within the same \u03b1-helix as Met251 make contact with residues in the \u03b210-\u03b113 loop. The loop immediately preceding Met354 also makes contact with the \u03b11-\u03b12 loop, including a hydrogen bond interaction between the sidechains of residues Asp71 and Tyr350 ( Figure 6 ). The chemical shift changes to Met74 and Met354 induced by the Met299Ile (Met299 being in motif B) mutation may also be explained in terms of this network of interaction.",

Moreover, some long-range interactions still remain difficult to rationalize. For example, the Gly64Ser mutation can lead to small changes to the T 2 relaxation time for Met392 ( Figure 5) , and the Met392Ile mutation can lead to a small chemical shift change to the Met6 resonance (Supporting Information Table S3 ), even though Met392 is on the thumb domain of 3D pol far from Met6 and Gly64 without an easily traceable, direct path of interaction.",

Thus, we propose that these long-distance interactions are functionally important, and may help to coordinate ligand binding and enzyme catalysis. Similar interaction networks in 3D pol have also been suggested to be important for the regulation of polymerase activity by the viral protein 3CD and the formation of higher order replication machinery within the cell (55) . Long-range interaction networks may also explain the increased thermal stability of 3D pol in the presence of nucleotide (56) . Recent NMR studies of the bacteriophage \u03c66 RNAdependent RNA polymerase (53) have revealed long-range interactions operating on the \u03bcsms timescale important for the function of this structurally similar enzyme (53).",

            "text": "Structural and/or dynamic changes to this network of interactions may thus affect the function and fidelity of PV 3D pol . In the case of Gly64Ser 3D pol , these differences include changes to regions important for RNA binding and recognition (e.g. Met95, Met187, Met189), nucleotide recognition (Met6 insofar as it indirectly reports on structural changes in motifs A and B) and phosphodiester bond formation (Met354 in motif D that also contains the general acid Lys359). It is also intriguing that there are more significant chemical shift differences between WT and Gly64Ser 3D pol in the ternary complex when bound to the incorrect nucleotide (i.e. E:RNA:3\u2032-dATP) than the correct nucleotide (E:RNA:UTP). Met6 on the N-terminal \u03b2-strand especially appears to be responsive to differences between correct versus incorrect ternary complex formation. It was previously observed that mutations to Gly1 result in enzymes with significantly reduced catalytic activity (36, 45) , and moreover, these mutations (e.g. Gly1Ala) can significantly affect the interactions with motifs A and B, and in particular, change the orientation of Asp238 (45) that is responsible for making hydrogen bond interactions with the incoming nucleotide to properly position the nucleotide for phosphodiester bond formation (19) (20) (21) 45) . Thus, Met6 may be an indirect reporter on the structural changes in motif A. Our findings suggest that there is a conformational change when incorrect nucleotide binds to Gly64Ser 3D pol that does not occur when incorrect nucleotide binds to WT 3D pol , and this difference can be traced to the N-terminal \u03b2-strand and likely, motif A. For Gly64Ser 3D pol , this may result in a decrease to the conversion rate between 'inactive' conformation to catalytically competent conformation when incorrect nucleotide binds compared to what occurs with WT 3D pol , resulting in a higher fidelity polymerase. NMR studies with other probes (e.g. Val, Leu, Ile) may reveal additional structural and/or dynamic differences between WT and Gly64Ser 3D pol and further highlight the roles of the long-range interaction network in the function and fidelity of 3D pol .",
