Acute diarrhea refers to acute onset of symptoms of less than 14 to 30 days' duration. Diarrhea lasting longer than 1 month is considered chronic. The severity of acute diarrhea can be defined as mild, where no change in daily activities is noted; moderate, where a change in daily activities is required but the patient is able to function; and severe, where the patient is disabled by the symptoms.",

            "text": "Dysentery is a disease process characterized by diarrhea that contains blood and polymorphonuclear cells. Dysentery results when an organism causes an inflammatory reaction, either by direct invasion of the colonic/ileal epithelium or by producing a toxin that causes cellular death and tissue damage. Symptoms associated with dysentery may include abdominal pain and cramping, tenesmus (painful urgency to evacuate stool), fever, and dehydration. 6. Name the common causes of infectious dysentery in the United States Campylobacter and Salmonella spp. are the principal causes of dysentery in the United States. Shigella sp. and certain strains of Escherichia coli (specifically O157:H7) are less common. Rarer causes include Yersinia, Entamoeba, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas spp. 7. What is the significance of stool leukocytes (white blood cells) and how are they detected? The presence of fecal leukocytes helps to distinguish inflammatory from noninflammatory diarrhea. Normally, leukocytes are not present in stool. Fecal leukocytes are usually found in infectious diarrhea caused by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Yersinia spp.; Clostridium difficile; enterohemorrhagic and enteroinvasive strains of E. coli; and Aeromonas sp. In cases of ischemic colitis and inflammatory bowel disease, fecal leukocytes are the result of mucosal bleeding. Diarrhea secondary to toxigenic bacteria (e.g., enterotoxigenic E. coli [ETEC], Vibrio cholerae), viruses, and small bowel protozoa (e.g., Giardia sp.) do not contain stool leukocytes. The presence of white blood cells (WBCs) in the stool can be assayed by microscopic examination of the stool or by means of an immunoassay for the neutrophil marker lactoferrin. The sensitivity of fecal lactoferrin and microscopy for fecal WBCs is 92% and 72%, respectively. 8. If 100 random patients with acute diarrhea underwent evaluation with stool cultures, how many would be positive? Which patients with acute diarrhea should be evaluated with a stool culture? Published studies show the diagnostic yield of stool cultures to be 1.5% to 5.6%. This percentage range can be increased if tested patients are selected carefully. A stool culture should be obtained from patients with dysentery",

Intestinal damage results primarily from direct invasion of the organism into the colonic epithelium and, to a lesser extent, from the production of an enterotoxin. The Shigella toxin is composed of an A subunit, which is catalytic, and a B subunit, which is responsible for binding. Stool volume is typically low and the diarrhea may be bloody, mucoid, or watery. The endoscopic appearance of shigellosis shows intense involvement of the rectosigmoid with variable proximal involvement. Approximately 15% of cases present with pancolitis.

Most patients with acute diarrhea do not require antibiotic therapy. Bacterial resistance is a significant problem in treating the bacterial organisms that cause diarrhea. Many of the diarrhea-causative bacterial organisms are resistant to the penicillins, tetracycline, and TMP-SMX. On the average, significant resistance is noted approximately 10 years following the introduction of an antibiotic.",

            "text": "Historically, treatment of dysentery with antimotility agents, such as diphenoxylate-atropine (Lomotil) and loperamide (Imodium), has been contraindicated. It was believed that reduced intestinal motility would worsen dysentery by slowing pathogen clearance. Recent studies of patients with shigellosis dysentery who were given a combination of loperamide and antibiotic therapy had a shortened duration of diarrhea without adverse effects. Antimotility agents continue to be contraindicated in children with dysentery because of recurrent adverse case reports. 32. Several members of a family develop nausea, emesis, and watery diarrhea 2 to 6 hours after a picnic. Food at the picnic included ham, rice, and custard pie. What type of bacteria is likely to be the cause? Enterotoxin-producing bacteria must be considered because the symptoms began soon after ingestion of the food. Two enterotoxin-producing bacteria that cause symptoms with such a short incubation are Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Coagulase-positive strains of S. aureus are responsible for many cases of food poisoning in the United States. S. aureus enterotoxin is heat-stable. The incubation period from ingestion to symptoms (nausea, emesis, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea) is approximately 3 hours (range, 1 to 6 hours). S. aureus favors growth in foods with high sugar content (e.g., custard) and high salt intake (e.g., ham). Recovery is generally complete in 24 to 48 hours. B. cereus is a spore-forming, gram-positive rod that produces a diarrheogenic, heat-labile enterotoxin. Vomiting can occur within 2 hours of ingestion of contaminated food. Almost all persons with B. cereus develop diarrhea. Meat and rice are the most common food vehicles for infection. Clostridium perfringens also produces an enterotoxin. However, the time of onset of symptoms is usually 8 to 16 hours after ingestion of contaminated food. ",

Chemoprophylaxis with bismuth salicylate (2 tablets with meals and at bedtime) or with the poorly absorbed (less than 0.4%) antibiotic rifaximin (200 mg twice a day) is effective in reducing diarrhea. Probiotics have also been shown to be efficacious although less so than bismuth or rifaximin. Chemoprophylaxis should be given to persons with prior gastric surgery, those taking acid-blocking medicines (H 2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors), or those who are debilitated and immunosuppressed. Travelers who cannot risk or afford a short illness while traveling may opt for chemoprophylaxis.",

The illness is characterized by massive watery stool output, at times in excess of 1 L/hr. Dehydration, hypovolemic shock, and death occur rapidly if fluid replacement is not provided. The cholera organisms colonize the upper small bowel and release an enterotoxin that binds to and activates mucosal cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which, in turn, activates chloride channels in mucosal crypts and leads to the massive secretory diarrhea. A second toxin, called the zonula occludens toxin (ZOT), increases intestinal permeability. The intestinal mucosa is not altered by the organism.",

The illness can be caused by any serotype of Salmonella but results most commonly from S. typhi and less commonly from S. paratyphi . Because humans are the only known reservoir of S. typhi , transmission is primarily by the fecal-oral route. The illness usually lasts for 3 to 5 weeks.

Although diarrhea is unusual, ulceration of Peyer patches in the intestinal wall may cause hemorrhage or perforation. A number of vaccines are successful against typhoid.
