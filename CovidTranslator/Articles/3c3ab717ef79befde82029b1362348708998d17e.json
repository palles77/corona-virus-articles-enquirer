            "text": "IMPORTANCE Most studies examining the host transcriptional response to infection focus only on protein-coding genes. However, there is growing evidence that thousands of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are transcribed from mammalian genomes. While most attention to the involvement of ncRNAs in virus-host interactions has been on small ncRNAs such as mi-croRNAs, it is becoming apparent that many long ncRNAs (>200 nucleotides [nt]) are also biologically important. These long ncRNAs have been found to have widespread functionality, including chromatin modification and transcriptional regulation and serving as the precursors of small RNAs. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, whole-transcriptome analysis of the host response, including long ncRNAs, is now possible. Using this approach, we demonstrated that virus infection alters the expression of numerous long ncRNAs, suggesting that these RNAs may be a new class of regulatory molecules that play a role in determining the outcome of infection.",

These mice were selected due to their differential range in susceptibility phenotypes following infection with SARS-CoV or influenza virus and the capacity to pursue downstream quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of regulation and function in the Collaborative Cross. Weight loss in the animals was monitored over the course of the infection with SARS MA15 or influenza virus A/PR/8/34 as a measure of disease severity (Fig. 1) . We then performed a whole-transcriptome analysis of collected lung tissue samples using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Directional cDNA libraries were constructed using the not-so-random (NSR) priming method (6) , which enabled the profiling of polyadenylated, nonpolyadenylated, coding, and noncoding transcripts, but not small RNAs (6) .",

As expected, most (35 of 37 [95%]) of the selected ncRNAs and genomic regions were differentially expressed (P \u03fd 0.05) during SARS-CoV infection under one or more conditions studied. Interestingly, the response to viral infection also displayed temporal changes, as 35 (95%) of the selected ncRNAs and genomic regions showed significant changes in expression (P \u03fd 0.05) between at least two consecutive time points. Twenty-six (70%) of the ncRNAs and genomic regions were differentially expressed (P \u03fd 0.05) among knockout and wild-type mice under one or more conditions during infection.

For example, the differential regulation of some ncRNAs could simply be byproducts of global transcriptional profile changes imparted by interferon and/or viral infection, and they may not play a significant role in the context of infection. Alternatively, ncRNAs may represent a whole new class of innate immunity signaling molecules and interferondependent regulators, or even a new layer of gene expression regulation responsible for modulating host responses during viral infection. Similarly, ncRNAs may also represent a new potential class of biomarkers for infectious diseases. The similar differential regulation of ncRNAs in response to SARS-CoV and influenza virus infection indicates that a ncRNA-based signature of respiratory virus infection may exist, suggesting additional diagnostic potential. Finally, using viruses to perturb host systems, such as described here, also presents a valuable platform for future studies of ncRNA biology in general. In the future, it is likely that a detailed knowledge of ncRNA regulation and function will be necessary for a full understanding of viral pathogenesis.",

In this study, we infected four of the founder mouse strains used in generating the Collaborative Cross (CC), a newly emerging recombinant inbred mouse resource for mapping complex traits (15) . These strains included 129S1/SvImJ (129/S1), CAST/EiJ (CAST), PWK/PhJ (PWK), and WSB/EiJ (WSB) mice, and the animals were provided by Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena or obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). A benefit of using these strains is that it allows for downstream quantitative trait locus (QTL) and expression QTL (eQTL) mapping of the regulation and function of non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) in pathogenesis and innate immunity in the final panel of 400 CC recombinant inbred mouse lines. Mice were bred at the University of North Carolina (UNC) mouse facility (Chapel Hill, NC). Animal housing, care, and experimental protocols were in accordance with all UNC-Chapel Hill Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. All animal studies were conducted in animal biosafety level 3 laboratories using Sealsafe HEPA-filtered caging, and personnel wore personal protective equipment, including Tyvek suits and hoods as well as positivepressure HEPA-filtered air respirators. Ten-week-old mice were anesthetized with isoflurane. Mice were intranasally infected with phosphate- (dpi) with tissues taken for determination of the viral titer and for expression analysis. In this study, one SARS rMA15-infected and one mockinfected mouse from each of the four strains was euthanized at 2 dpi for both the whole-transcriptome analysis using high-throughput sequencing and microarray-based expression profiling. The remaining replicate samples from matched infections were evaluated by qPCR.",

We investigated various numbers of mismatches ranging from zero (i.e., a perfect match between read and genomic sequence) to four.

As it is not trivial to differentiate short reads mapped to the regions shared by overlapping transcripts, we clustered the overlapping annotated transcripts into single loci. We then filtered out those loci that overlap with any protein-coding transcripts as annotated or predicted by UCSC or Ensembl to minimize the possibility of the inclusion of protein-coding genes. Obviously, many genuine ncRNAs were excluded from our consideration because of this conservative approach. We obtained 10,986 nonoverlapping ncRNA loci (8,008 of which were larger than 200 nt), in addition to 21,565 protein-coding loci. We estimated the transcript abundance of a locus by counting all reads mapped to the locus, instead of only exonic regions as is typically done when using RNA-Seq for protein-coding loci (19) , as the gene structures of many ncRNAs were unknown. We then normalized the raw read counts by the length of the locus and the total uniquely mapped reads for each sample and represented the normalized expression levels similarly as typical RPKMs (reads per kilobase per million reads). An offset of 0.05 was added to all RPKMs before calculating log ratios to avoid taking the log of 0 and to decrease the variability of the log ratios for loci with low read counts.",

For each window, we computed a score, S w , as the number of reads aligned within the window, normalized by the total number of uniquely mapped reads for each sample. (ii) To identify differentially expressed windows, we created ratios of scores between the pair of samples and selected those windows passing a threshold (f s ) for fold change. (iii) We merged overlapping windows into large intervals if they were differentially expressed in the same direction. (iv) To obtain larger intervals, we joined identified neighboring intervals if there were a low number of reads in between and the larger intervals formed by neighboring ones were also differentially expressed, judged by a threshold f j . (v) To increase the confidence, we then selected only those intervals that were differentially expressed consistently in at least k pairs of samples (here all upregulated or all downregulated in at least 3 out of 4 mouse strains).

The mice were weighed once per day and observed twice per day over the course of the infection. For each virus, three to five virus-infected and three mockinfected mice from each strain were euthanized at 2 days postinfection FIG 5 Comparison of infection to mock infection expression ratios for 37 differentially expressed ncRNAs and genomic regions. (a) Comparison of the log 2 infection/mock infection expression ratios for 37 differentially expressed ncRNAs and genomic regions originally obtained by NGS and then by qPCR on independently collected lung samples from mice infected with SARS-CoV or influenza virus. The influenza virus used was A/PR/8/34 (PR8). Each column represents an independent sample collected from one infected mouse. For qPCR, individual replicate samples were compared to the average of 2 or 3 matched mock-infected samples to form infection/mock infection expression ratios. All samples were collected 2 days after infection. The color red on the heat map indicates upregulation during infection, while the color green indicates downregulation during infection. In the colored bar to the left of the heat map, 13 annotated ncRNAs are shown in dark orange, 19 nonannotated genomic regions are shown in blue, and 5 lincRNAs partially overlapping with annotated protein-coding genes are shown in green. The genomic locations of ncRNAs and genomic regions are shown in Fig. S4 in the supplemental material. The mouse strains are shown at the bottom of the panel. (b) Temporal expression profiles of the same selected ncRNAs and genomic regions (in the same order as in panel a) measured by qPCR in wild-type (129/S6), STAT1 knockout (STAT1\u03ea/\u03ea), and type 1 interferon receptor knockout (IFNAR\u03ea/\u03ea) mice infected by SARS-CoV. The values shown are the log 2 ratios of the expression levels in infected replicate samples to the average expression levels in strain-matched mock-infected samples. The color red on the heat map indicates up regulation during infection, while the color green indicates downregulation during infection. The samples were collected 2, 5, and 9 days after infection (dpi 2, 5, and 9, respectively). The numbered lines to the right of the heat map indicate groups of ncRNAs and genomic regions based on their temporal expression changes during infection to guide visualization: 1, mostly downregulated in STAT1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice; 2, consistently upregulated in all three types of mice; 3, mostly upregulated in wild-type and STAT1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, but not in IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice, especially for the later time points; 4, highly upregulated in STAT1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, but not in wild-type and IFNAR \u03ea/\u03ea mice; 5, transiently upregulated at early time points in all three types of mice; 6, downregulated in STAT1 \u03ea/\u03ea mice only and, as shown in panel a, upregulated in SARS-CoV-infected mice but downregulated in influenza virus-infected mice; and 7, no significant changes observed in all three types of mice. (c) Temporal expression profiles of the same selected ncRNAs and genomic regions (in the same order as in panel a) measured by qPCR in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) from mice of strain 129S1/SvlmJ (129/S1 MEFs) and PWK/PhJ (PWK MEFs) treated with 500 U of mouse beta interferon (IFN) or influenza A virus A/Pr/8/34 (PR8) (MOI of 1 or 10). The values shown are the log 2 ratios of the expression levels in samples from virus-infected or IFN-treated MEFs to the average expression levels in time-and strain-matched samples from mock-infected MEFs. The color red on the heat map indicates upregulation during infection, while the color green indicates downregulation during infection. The samples were collected 6 and 24 hours after IFN treatment or virus infection (shown below the heat maps). Mx1 and Ifit1, two protein-coding genes that are known to be upregulated during viral infection, are positive controls for in vitro treatment.",
