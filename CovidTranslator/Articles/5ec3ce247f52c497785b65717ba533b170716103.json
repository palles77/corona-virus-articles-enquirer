            "text": "Clinical recognition of the syndromes associated with the polio virus date back about 200 years. The fact that the disease was caused by a transmissible viral particle was demonstrated by 1908. Until early in the twentieth century the virus was readily transmitted throughout the population almost continuously by personal contact and by the fecal-oral route via water. The result was that most people's first exposure to the virus occurred in infancy. At this age most infections resulted in a clinically unapparent infection, in part due to partial protection by maternal antibody, after which lifelong immunity was established. Only a few suffered a paralytic episode with the infection, at the time termed ''infantile paralysis.'' 1 As hygienic standards of the advanced economy nations rose throughout the first half of the century, early childhood exposure to the virus declined. An increasing fraction of the population had their first exposure in late childhood or during young adulthood. In these age groups the likelihood that the infection will cause a paralytic syndrome is greatly increased, so both the incidence of clinically recognized infection and that of paralysis rose. By the early 1950s clinically recognized cases had reached 15-25 annually for every 100,000 people in the United States, making it a major public health concern and a source of a great deal of fear in the general populace. 2 More than 90% of polio virus infections are asymptomatic. However, at the more severe end of the clinical spectrum are the paralytic syndromes which range from paralysis of one or more limbs (''spinal polio'') to syndromes with respiratory muscle or bulbar paralysis (''respiratory polio'' or ''bulbospinal polio'') with loss of respiratory or upper airway muscle function or both. These more severe outcomes rise in incidence from about 0.1% in infants to more than 1% in older children and adults.",

Use of a mechanical respirator to try to avert death was first attempted at the Children's Hospital in Boston in 1928, using an ''iron lung.'' 3 The machine was basically a sealed box with a hole at one end for the patient's head to protrude, attached to two vacuum cleaners. The motors were then cycled to alternately create vacuum inside the box, expanding the patient's chest and causing the patient to inhale through the mouth (outside the box), then allowing air back into the box to permit exhalation. The design was further improved in 1931, and the machines came into increasingly broad use throughout North America and Europe during the severe outbreaks of the 1930s. Adoption of this therapy resulted in a significant reduction in mortality during these years.",

A more cost-effective and user-friendly approach to providing respiratory support was clearly needed. This finally came by bringing the positive pressure ventilation (PPV) concept out of the operating room. PPV was first used for respiratory support for polio victims at Blegdam Hospital in Copenhagen, Denmark, an innovation attributable to Danish anesthetist Bjorn Ibsen. 4 During this large outbreak in 1952, some 200 medical students were put to work hand-ventilating dozens of patients through tracheostomies until the worst of the paralytic phase of the illness had passed, often several weeks. The concept quickly spread elsewhere and was widely adopted, yielding substantial reductions in mortality. For reasons of efficiency and convenience, patients needing respiratory support were often grouped in a single location where the necessary expertise and equipment were available. The introduction of PPV into a defined area of the hospital used to support respiratory failure was the genesis of the modern ICU and represents a signal event in the development of the field of Critical Care Medicine.",

Over 200 were affected and 34 died, an alarming mortality rate, especially since physicians caring for the patients had no idea what was causing the illness. Conventional microbiologic investigations yielded no convincing pathogens despite intensive investigation for the usual bacteria and viruses and other potential pathogens. Epidemiologic and various biologic investigations were quickly implemented by local health authorities and by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). These showed that the disease was likely airborne and that it occurred more frequently in older individuals who had underlying lung disease, smoked, or were relatively immunocompromised. Analysis of the likelihood of death revealed that those who received tetracyclines or macrolide antibiotics were more likely to survive than those who received only betalactams. However, no causal agent was uncovered, though many potential causes were excluded-most known bacteria and viruses, many biologic toxins and many environmental agents such as toxic chemicals and metals.",

Over time, demonstration that it was a widely occurring colonizer of brackish water, particularly in air conditioners, cooling towers, and water heaters and pipes, led to the implication of these reservoirs in several hundred outbreaks of the disease worldwide, especially in hospitals and other public health institutions, and hotels. Thus began widespread development of regulations and guidelines for limiting the degree of colonization of these water sources by Legionella, resulting in a reduction in the size, number, and scope of subsequent outbreaks.",

Early in the course most patients developed a diffuse macular rash, often with mucous membrane inflammation, with subsequent desquamation during convalescence. Patients frequently required massive fluid resuscitation because of systemic capillary leak, as well as vasopressor support, mechanical ventilation for adult respiratory distress syndrome, and even renal replacement therapy for acute renal failure, complicating the shock episode. One of the early clusters of observed cases was reported in 1978, and the term ''toxic shock syndrome'' was coined based on the isolation of an exotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus from mucosal surfaces or the site of a minor infection in the absence of bacteremia. 8 As the case numbers rapidly increased case definitions for the syndrome were formulated and epidemiologic studies mounted. By 1980, over 1000 cases had been formally reported to the CDC. 9 The case fatality rate was reported to be as high as 15% in the more severe cases included in the earliest reports, falling to about 3%-5% as recognition of the syndrome improved. By this time there were clear epidemiologic links between the syndrome and menstrual use of high-absorbency tampons which were often left in place longer than less absorbent products. Colonization of the tampon with Staphylococcus aureus was also implicated, consistent with the postulated toxin-mediated disease mechanism. 10 Within months of these revelations the main manufacturer of the implicated tampons withdrew them from the market and women began changing tampons with greater frequency or stopped using them at the urging of public health authorities. The incidence of the syndrome immediately began to fall and within a few years, with the changing of use patterns of tampons and changes in their manufacture, toxic shock syndrome disappeared, for the most part, but not entirely, from the ICU.",

This syndrome, which was almost certainly extant before but little-recognized, was perhaps the main lesson from the outbreak: even trivial staphylococcal skin or wound infections Light or mucosal surface colonization in the presence of a foreign body such as a nasal pack for nosebleed can lead to a severe shock syndrome if the organism is present and produces this toxin or one of several related ones. The recognition of the staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome also led to increasing understanding of the role of ''superantigens'' as a mechanism of disease-bacterial toxins capable of activating a large fraction (up to 20%) of the total T-lymphocyte population. Such superantigens have since been implicated in a number of other disease syndromes, among them the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (see below).",

The organism, then thought to be a protozoon, had been first described in 1909 by Carlos Chagas in Brazil, and since then had been clearly implicated as a cause of interstitial pneumonia in debilitated and malnourished children (in the aftermath of World War II) and, later, a cause of severe opportunistic pneumonia in immunocompromised patients, usually those being treated with highdose corticosteroids for connective tissue diseases or lymphoreticular neoplasms. 13 In these patients it caused an impressively aggressive bilateral pneumonia leading to acute respiratory failure. This pneumonia was notoriously difficult to definitively diagnose, requiring bronchoscopy or open lung biopsy to demonstrate the small numbers of characteristic Pneumocystis organisms on special silver stains of clinical specimens. The mainstay of treatment at that time was pentamidine, generally given intramuscularly, giving way to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole after the publication in 1978 of a randomized clinical trial showing that it was at least as effective and generally better tolerated. 14 In the early 1980s, a new form of the infection began to be seen with regularity. Young men began to present to hospital with a rather more indolent diffuse bilateral pneumonia that nevertheless went on to cause respiratory failure and which, when investigated, proved to be due to Pneumocystis. 15 The course of the disease was quite different from what physicians had been used to up to then. It began more gradually, progressed at a slower pace and was associated with a much lesser systemic inflammatory response. Microscopy of respiratory specimens revealed exponentially more organisms than previously seen, such that many patients could be diagnosed from sputum specimens rather than bronchoscopy, and biopsy was virtually never needed. Nobody had any idea why this was happening, although it quickly became apparent that the underlying cause of the infection was a new form of severe deficiency of cell-mediated immunity.",

However, as experience with the disease developed it became clear that an early and aggressive approach could improve prognosis. It was found that in the AIDS population even minor respiratory symptoms with few or no abnormalities on chest radiograph could be due to Pneumocystis infection in the earlier stages, and that even modest degrees of arterial oxygen desaturation signaled impending respiratory failure.

Following identification of the virus in 1984, there soon followed increasingly reliable diagnostic tests for the infection, leading to earlier identification of cases and monitoring of CD4 lymphocyte counts. By the early 1990s, studies supporting widespread use of chemoprophylaxis against Pneumocystis in all patients with CD4 counts <200/mm 3 were available and became standard public health agency recommendations. Pneumocystosis, which in the 1980s and 1990s was one of the principal causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure in many ICUs in North America and western Europe, began to decline rapidly in incidence, becoming relatively uncommon even before the widespread adoption of highly active antiretroviral therapy, which has, since the mid-1990s, caused the disease to all but disappear from our ICUs.",

However, this improved with clinical experience as it became evident that administration of large amounts of intravenous fluids in the face of profound capillary leak only resulted in much worse generalized and pulmonary edema, with little improvement in the shock state and only worsening of the respiratory failure. Management changed to an approach limiting the amount of fluid administered early in the course together with earlier institution of inotropic support, resulting in a much improved survival rate of about 60%, generally with minimal or no long-term sequelae in survivors. 20 In subsequent years development of increasingly specific serologic and virologic testing has demonstrated that this disease had been present but unrecognized throughout North and South America long before this outbreak, and that there are several related viruses, each associated with a particular rodent, causing endemic disease and the occasional outbreak. By the mid-1990s, over 150 cases were reported in 25 states, mainly in the Southwest, and cases have since been reported Plagues in the ICU in small numbers in most other states, Canada, Mexico, and South America, where several outbreaks have occurred. Whereas occasional cases continue to be seen in ICUs in all these areas, no further major outbreaks have yet occurred in the United States or Canada, though clearly remaining a threat under the right conditions; the only currently available preventive measure is avoiding rodent contact. 21 Steven Simpson, MD, one of the intensivists at the Health Sciences Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who was closely involved in the initial Four Corners outbreak, points out that the event highlights several trends in subsequent disease outbreaks in North America. One is the extreme rapidity with which novel pathogens and potential pharmacotherapeutic agents can now be identified. Whereas the pathogen in the Legionnaire's outbreak took almost a year to identify, researchers identified the HPS pathogen and its source in just months. Computerized access to data and data analysis along with virtually instantaneous electronic transmission of information plays a central role in this development.",

The illness usually requires ICU support for massive fluid resuscitation, vasopressor and inotropic support and mechanical ventilation.

Addition of clindamycin to the usual penicillin or other beta-lactam therapy was advocated and widely adopted, based on results from animal models of the syndrome and on pharmacologic and physiologic considerations, including its ability to inhibit bacterial protein (ie, toxin) synthesis, penetrate necrotic tissues, and inhibit inflammatory cytokine synthesis. 27 Toxin neutralization using pooled intravenous gamma globulin was also advocated with the support of primarily historical case-control studies. 28 In most centers, implementation of these approaches has led to dramatic reductions in mortality rates to about 20%-30% although, in the absence of any adequate controlled trials, it remains unclear what the relative contribution of each of these measures has been to the improved outcome.",

Shortly thereafter, one of his sons was admitted to hospital with a severe respiratory illness and died a few days later. By this time, four other family members had become ill and had been admitted to hospital; the first cases of affected health care workers appeared soon after among those who had cared for the dying son of the index case. Within days, other instances of transmission from undiagnosed contacts of the initial cases in hospitals, doctors' offices, emergency rooms, and at social events were leading to admission of cases to several hospitals throughout Toronto. The response of the public health authorities, beginning soon after the WHO global alert and coincident with the recognition of the first local cases, was quick and vigorous, including closure of the main affected hospital, intensive follow-up of probable contacts, quarantine of suspected cases based on a fairly inclusive case definition and strict institution of barrier contact protection for health care workers. 32 By mid-April the number of new cases was rapidly declining, although there was one cluster of late cases related to exposure of a large number of health care workers during the resuscitation and difficult intubation of a critically ill patient. A later cluster of cases also occurred in a rehabilitation hospital, where it appeared that unrecognized contacts from the first phase of the outbreak had been transferred and transmitted the disease to other patients and staff.",

            "text": "Intensive epidemiologic and laboratory study of the disease by investigators and laboratories worldwide led to unprecedented rapid growth in knowledge about the causative agent. The virus, more or less simultaneously characterized at a number of laboratories around the world, proved to be a previously unknown coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]-CoV) with capacity to infect and spread from a variety of wild animals to humans. Epidemiologic, serologic, and virologic evidence was developed linking human cases to exposure to infected wild animals, including masked palm civets, raccoon dogs, ferrets and ferret badgers, all being sold for human consumption in markets in China. 33 Control of their transport and sale and exposures to humans by Chinese health authorities was probably one of the major factors in bringing the first outbreak under control, the partial failure of which later led to a second, much smaller outbreak late in 2004. Although the initial speculation was that one or more of these wild animals were the reservoir in nature for the infection, it now appears more likely that the viral reservoir is actually bats, with crosstransmission of the virus between bats, food animals, and humans in crowded markets leading to development of strains with the capacity to transmit between humans. 34 Public health authorities worldwide learned much from SARS about the importance of effective international communication in developing a rapid and effective response to outbreaks of novel viruses, and more about how to go about containing such infections within communities and hospitals. Several intensivists involved in the outbreak credit e-mail communications from other international outbreak sites for effective advice on critical elements of disease protection (eg, Powered Air Purifying Respirators and full contact rather than droplet precautions) and therapy. For the critical care community, perhaps one main lesson was the importance of ''super-spreading incidents'' in propagating the disease in hospitals. Many of these occurred in critically ill patients undergoing resuscitation with difficult or traumatic intubation, generating aerosols in closed spaces which contained many superfluous and inadequately protected health care workers. Handling these situations safely depends crucially on identifying the potential risk and undertaking the resuscitation and intubation using the most experienced operators available, adequately protected with basic barrier precautions (eye protection, gloves and surgical face-masks), using sedation or paralysis as necessary to minimize trauma and aerosol generation, and with only essential and adequately protected staff in the room. 35 This likely applies to many other situations with potential for disease transmission to health care workers.",

When the ''flu'' arrives in an area, cases begin to appear suddenly and there is rapid spread in the population, usually with 20%-30% becoming infected over a 6-week period with a peak in case numbers at week two or three. About half of those infected will seek medical attention, many more than once, and one to about 25 per thousand infected will be admitted to hospital with a respiratory syndrome such as pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, asthmatic attack, or cardiac failure, the rate depending on age and underlying comorbidities. Overall, about 0.1% of those infected die, with mortality rates among those with major comorbidities up to 5%.

The most recent circulating influenza virus just before that time was an H3N8 that had arrived in 1901. Current evidence suggests that an avian influenza virus underwent a period of evolutionary adaptation, possibly in another susceptible species such as swine, fitting it for transmission to humans, which it then did. 36, 37 This H1N1 virus had not been previously experienced by any segment of the population except the very old, so nearly everyone, particularly non-elderly adults and children, was without immunity and was at risk of severe infection. Attack rates, as noted earlier, were extremely high everywhere as were rates of primary influenza pneumonia, complicating bacterial pneumonia, and death. In the United States, death rates were more than 20-fold higher than in any influenza pandemic since. An outbreak of influenza on this scale, if unchecked by effective antiviral therapy or vaccines, would render ICU care such as mechanical ventilatory support for respiratory failure irrelevant. Even today, with maximal respiratory support, most patients with diffuse primary viral pneumonia complicated by respiratory failure cannot be saved, and the numbers presenting for such care in a short space of time, if comparable to the 1918 pandemic, would overwhelm our current ICU capacity within days.",

WHO data indicate that there have been 387 laboratory-confirmed cases of such transmission from 2003 to mid-2008. 38 The mortality rate has exceeded 60%, although it is likely that many less severe cases do not come to medical attention and are therefore not counted as confirmed case survivors. To date no instances of transmission to humans by humans or other mammals has been documented.
