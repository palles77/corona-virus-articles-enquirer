            "text": "To the editor, Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) caused by human neurotrophic polyomavirus (JCV) is a central nervous system (CNS) disease in immunodeficient patients. PML is associated with a poor prognosis and the only intervention leading to clearance of the virus is removal of iatrogenic immune suppression. In particular, the prognosis is dismal in patients with severe primary immunodeficiency (PID) [1] . However, our clinical experience described in this case report supports the possibility that nitazoxanide, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic and antiviral drug [2] , may have helped in controlling the JCV in a single patient with PML associated with combined PID. This antiviral effect of nitazoxanide may have been produced by induction of innate immunity, downregulation of viral receptors, or interference with maturation of viral proteins [2, 3] .",

Despite a normal CD19 + count (96-159 \u00d7 10 6 /l, ref 80-616 \u00d7 10 6 /l), B cell maturation was defective (marginal zone 0.48-0.8 \u00d7 10 6 /l, 0.5% of all CD19 + , ref 7.2-30.8%; switched memory B cells 0.67-1.1 \u00d7 10 6 /l, 0.7%, ref 6.5-29.2%) with no response to pneumococcus antigens.

A single 500mg oral dose of nitazoxanide has been reported to produce a peak plasma concentration of 10 \u03bcg/ml in human, while the IC50 has been between 0.2 to 1.5 \u03bcg/ml for rubella, influenza, coronavirus, and hepatitis C [2, 3] . On day +45 (acute), ex vivo interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) secretion by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells upon JCV VP1 peptide stimulation were normal compared to two natalizumab-associated (Fig. 1) . In contrast, JCV-specific T cell responses were absent in CD8 + T cells collected 15 months before PML diagnosis as compared to six healthy individuals. Very few CD4 + T cells secreted TNF\u03b1 15 months before PML diagnosis; this indicates prior exposure to JCV (Fig. 1, HC/pre) . Reaction to polyclonal phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was below average in CD4 + T cells and on average in CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1) . The CD4/CD8 ratio was reduced at 0.88 15 months prior to PML diagnosis, but restored to a value of 3.5 five weeks after the start of nitazoxanide, indicating CD4 + T cell expansion. No obvious improvement in her chronic wounds was observed although the RV was eliminated from the lesions during nitazoxanide treatment [3] .",

On day +67, CSF was still positive for JCV DNA, but its viral load had dropped below the level of accurate quantitation. Thus, her nitazoxanide treatment continued without obvious side effects for a total of 160 days (until day +160). On day +175, CSF was negative for JCV DNA. There was no obvious clinical progression in her neurological symptoms although she suffered from episodes of aspiration pneumonia and febrile urinary tract infections. Sadly, she developed another episode of aspiration pneumonia, leading to death on day +185.",

During peginterferon-alfa-2a therapy, a slow progression in her neurological symptoms was observed. A similar interferon treatment attempt against JCV PML was also ineffective in a previously reported PID case [1] . However, it seems likely that nitazoxanide may have influenced the course of PML in this patient as indicated by the enhanced JCV-specific T cell responses, subsequent clearance of JCV DNA, and a prolonged clinically stable period without obvious progression of the PML. No other interventions to control the JCV were attempted, no immunosuppressive medications were used or discontinued, and the patient's blood counts were carefully monitored throughout the treatment. As far as we are aware, reversal of the CSF JCV nucleic acid to an undetectable level in a clinical PML of a PID patient has been rarely, if ever, previously reported [1] . We conclude that the potential of nitazoxanide should be explored further in a larger PML patient population suffering from primary immunodeficiencies. We emphasize, however, that molecular basis of the PID of our patient is not understood and the described experience may not necessarily be reproducible in other PID patients.",
