SARS is an acute respiratory illness caused by infection by the SARS virus whose key signs and symptoms are fever, respiratory compromise, chilis, muscle aches, headache, and loss of appetite. The etiological agent of SARS is a coronavirus which was identified in March 2003 [1] . The virus is spread predominantly by droplet and by direct or indirect contacts. It is believed that SARS first appeared in China, in Guangdong province, on November 16, 2002 . There were 305 SARS cases and five deaths between November 16 and February 9, 2003, reported in the Weekly Epidemiologic Record. On February 26, new reports of SARS outbreak came in from Hong Kong and Vietnam. More and more cases were reported worldwide since March and WHO has been reporting the daily SARS infection data. Since March 17, 2002 , complete data has been collected and various kinds of research have been carried out. A new coronavirus has been isolated from patients with SARS [2] , and the sequence of the complete genome of SARS-CoV was determined [3, 4] .",

Achieving control of SARS is a major challenge especially in a country as large and diverse as China.\" SARS was transmitted mainly in Guangdong province in the southern part of China, before March 2003. The reported total of SARS cases was 305 with five deaths by February 9, 2003 . Updated data on SARS cases and deaths in China has reached a total of 792 cases and 31 deaths as of February 28 [9] .

Drastic measures and actions were taken to bring SARS under control since April 20 [11] . Newspapers, radio, TV stations, and posters campaigned to educate the public on SARS prevention. Disinfectant was sprayed in many public places, including streets, shopping centers, airports, railways, bus terminals, classrooms, offices, and transportation vehicles. Individuals who have had direct or indirect contact with probable SARS-infected cases have been quarantined in their homes, hospitals, or campuses. Stern travel advisories were issued to students and workers, and the Golden week holiday (International Labour Day) was shortened from seven days to five days. A body temperature check is done for all air passengers and passengers who fail a therm-imaging check at the entrance are checked by nurses and doctors at the station's quarantine center. Many stock exchanges, cinemas, theaters, and internet cafes were closed temporarily. Quarantine outpatient departments were set up for fever patients in many large hospitals. Special hospitals for SARS treatment were specified in every large city. For example, the emergency quarantine center in Xiaotangshan, with a 1000-bed facility, was constructed within eight days. The number of daily reported new diagnosed SARS cases were large in late April and early May, but the control measures taken were adequate and effective. SARS infections began to decline after the middle of May, and the downward trend has continued until now. The daily number of reported new probable cases of SARS in mainland China declined considerably from an average of 166 cases during the first week of May to 90 cases during the second week, 27 cases in the third week, and 16 in the fourth week. The daily number of reported new cases dropped to an average of 2.5 [12] and has decreased to zero more recently [13] .",

            "text": "Although the disease is not yet well understood, much data has been collected during the SARS epidemic. We use statistical data for SARS in China to estimate the parameters and do numerical simulations on the basis of the discrete SARS model (1) . The average incubation period is taken as six days, divided into two parts, the first three days in the exposed class with less infectivity, and the last three days with more infectivity. The fraction k is taken as 0.1. From the statistical data, we estimate that a fraction 3/5 of the diagnosed SARS cases came from SARS suspected individuals, who had been quarantined and treated in hospitals, and a fraction 2/5 of the diagnosed SARS cases came from unquarantined individuals. We assume that a fraction 3/5 of the exposed individuals have been quarantined after they left the exposed class due to the stringent control measures. The transfer rate from the exposed class to the quarantined class is taken as a fraction (1/3) (3/5), while 2/5 of the exposed individuals still have not been quarantined after they left the exposed class before obvious SARS symptoms appeared and they were diagnosed. The transfer rate from the exposed class to the infective class is taken as (1/3) (2/5). Individuals in the infective and quarantined classes will enter the diagnosed class after three days on average and individuals in the diagnosed class will recover or die after three weeks in hospital on average. The SARS induced death rate is taken to be Using MATLAB, we obtain the simulation result shown in Figure 21 .",

From Figure 10 From the expression for the basic reproductive number R0, we see that R0 increases with k and/3, and decreases with 0. Thus, increases in/3 and k, and an increase of the period in the infective class all would contribute to an increase in the basic reproductive number. In a similar way, we can study the influence of changes in the other parameters on the basic reproductive number. In order to reduce the infection, it is necessary to bring the secondary reproductive number below 1 and the smaller the secondary reproductive number, the more rapid the decrease of the disease.
