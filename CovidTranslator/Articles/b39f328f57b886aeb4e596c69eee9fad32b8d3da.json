The World Health Organization (WHO) prioritised 17 NTDs for control and elimination by 2020 and defined a Road Map to help countries reach these goals. Improved diagnostics for NTDs are essential for guiding treatment strategies at different thresholds of control, interruption of transmission, elimination and post-elimination surveillance. While substantial progress has been made in the last decade with chemotherapy, the same cannot be said of diagnostics, largely due to the perceived lack of a commercially viable market for NTD diagnostics. New sample in-answer out nucleic acid amplification technologies that can be performed at the point-of-care offer improved performance over current technologies and the potential to test for multiple pathogens using a single specimen. Finding commonalities for different NTDs in terms of geographic overlap, sentinel populations and treatment strategy will allow NTD programs to leverage these innovations to build cost-effective multiplex surveillance platforms. Connectivity solutions linking data from diagnostic laboratories and POC test readers/ devices provide opportunities for automated surveillance systems to make health systems more efficient, improving patient outcomes and assessing impact of interventions in real time. New models of public-private product development partnerships are critical in leveraging diagnostic innovation in other priority area for better diagnosis, control and elimination of NTDs.",

NTDs with a common control strategy such as mass drug administration Different types of diagnostics are needed to inform policy decisions at different stages of control for NTDs for which MDA is the main control strategy [24] . After multiple rounds of MDA, highly sensitive and specific diagnostics are needed to locate \"hot spots\" of residual infection. For schistosomiasis, the intensity of transmission decreases with decreasing prevalence of infection. Microscopy is no longer sufficiently sensitive to detect residual infection in communities when the number of eggs per gram of stool falls below 40. Antigen or nucleic acid amplified tests (NAATs) are needed to replace microscopy to identify communities in which transmission is still occurring. However, most antigen detection tests using enzyme immunoassays or lateral flow tests have not been shown to be sufficiently sensitive and current NAATs are too expensive and technical demanding for community based screening. As NAATs become available in POC format and have data transmission capabilities, these devices can be taken around to different communities to determine the stage of control and to inform treatment strategies.",

To implement a successful POC diagnostics programme, the engagement of policy makers, stakeholders and partners to ensure buy-in and align necessary resources is a critical first step. Training and certification of vast number of health care providers to use POC diagnostics, and ensuring an effective supply chain for tests and drugs across the country present an enormous challenge to health systems that are already suffering from a critical shortage of human resources. Quality assurance systems, that include providing proficiency testing, sites visits, and corrective action, are essential to ensure that accurate results are being used to guide treatment decisions, and to ensure that control strategies are based on accurate surveillance data. Studies have shown that deployment of POC diagnostics can be an opportunity to improve health outcomes and strengthen health systems [29] [30] [31] . Overcoming challenges will in turn motivate health care workers and increase capacity and efficiency to test and treat appropriately. RDT introduction and implementation must be culturally sensitive and accompanied by an inter-connected system to monitor the necessary processes. Another key barrier to the appropriate use of POC diagnostics is the need to train clinicians to create a demand for them and then use the test results to effectively manage the patients. Improving the laboratory-clinician interface is an important but often neglected aspect of testing introduction.",
