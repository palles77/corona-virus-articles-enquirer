It has been 10 years since China implemented its new web-based infection surveillance system, which covers the largest population in the world. Methods: In this study, time series data were collected for 28 infectious diseases reported from 2005 to 2014 . Seasonality and long-term trends were explored using decomposition methods. Seasonality was expressed by calculating the seasonal indices. Long-term trends in the diseases were assessed using a linear regression model on the deseasonalized series. Results: During the 10-year period, 38 982 567 cases and 126 372 deaths were reported in the system. The proportion of deaths caused by AIDS increased from 12% in 2005 to 78% in 2014. There were six diseases for which the seasonal index range was greater than 2: dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, anthrax, cerebrospinal meningitis, and measles . Among the 28 diseases, the incidence of syphilis increased fastest, with an average increase of 0.018626/100 000 every month after adjustment for seasonality. Conclusions: Effective surveillance is helpful in gaining a better understanding of the infection behaviour of infectious diseases; this will greatly facilitate disease control and management.",

The new surveillance system was implemented formally in 2004. The new surveillance system has played an important role in detecting infectious diseases in a timely fashion, which has helped to protect the lives and health of the entire population and has reduced the economic and health impacts of the diseases on the whole of society. This new system is the largest infectious disease surveillance system covering the largest population in the world. 2 It has become possible to detect more infections and the data have become more complete and reliable since the new reporting system was established. 3 A survey showed that the average omission rate was 13% among the medical institutions throughout the country; the compliance rate for outpatient daily registration was 96%, the registry integrity rate was 97%, and the timely reporting rate for the medical institutions was 91%. 4 Thirty-nine notifiable infectious diseases are currently included in the surveillance system. These are divided into classes A, B, and C. 5 Class A notifiable diseases include the plague and cholera, which can cause large epidemics within a short period of time. Class B notifiable diseases include 28 infectious diseases that might cause epidemics, including AIDS, anthrax, etc. Class C notifiable diseases include less severe and less infectious diseases, such as mumps, rubella, acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis, leprosy, leishmaniasis, hydatid disease, etc.",

Statistical modelling has been used previously to summarize the time series behaviour of disease. 6 In the current study, the monthly time series data for 28 class B infectious diseases reported from 2005 to 2014 were collected. The class B infectious diseases were selected for study, as most of these diseases occur more frequently than class A diseases and they cause more severe epidemics than class C diseases. Class B infectious diseases are the main focus of the surveillance process.

The decomposition methods have been reported in previous studies. 6, 8 Decomposition breaks down the underlying patterns of time series into seasonality and longterm trends. The seasonal trend in the infection series can be expressed using seasonal indices. To calculate the seasonal factors, overall incidences are first averaged, and then the averaged incidence is divided by the mean incidence for each month. For example, the average incidence of malaria was 0.1344/100 000 during the 10 years and the mean incidence in May was 0.1059/ 100 000, thus the seasonal index for May is 0.788 (0.1344/0.1059). Seasonality shows the periodic fluctuations that are usually caused by known factors such as rainfall, temperature, timing of the holidays, etc. If the seasonal index is greater than 1, it means that the incidence is higher than the average level. Otherwise, it means that the incidence is lower than the average level. The trend cycle represents the long-term changes in the infection. After the seasonal indices have been calculated, one can deseasonalize the data by dividing by the corresponding index. A linear regression model is a simple way to express the long-term trend, in which a common linear regression model is established between the deseasonalized incidence and time t.",

It was reported that the detection of cases previous studies. 15 The incidence of rabies decreased dramatically during the 10 years. Various control policies have been implemented by the government, which have played an important role in reducing rabies incidence in China. 16 The seasonality of this disease series was analysed. Decomposition methods were used to decompose the surveillance time series data into seasonal patterns and long-term patterns; this can help in gaining an understanding of the behaviour of diseases over time. 17 The same methods were used on surveillance data for nine infectious disease for the years 2005-2011 in a previous study. 6 Seasonal patterns are one major pathway for the subtle but potentially drastic effects of climate change on disease dynamics. 18 In the current study, the seasonal patterns were quantified in the form of seasonal indices. Some of the infectious diseases, such as dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, anthrax, cerebrospinal meningitis, and measles, showed more obvious seasonality. Other diseases, such as the STDs, hepatitis disease, and tuberculosis showed relatively smooth seasonal index curves.",

Figures 2 and 3 illustrate the changes in proportions of cases and deaths caused by each disease. The disease spectrum shows the change in the relative severity of each disease. Public health resources are usually limited in developing countries such as China, which has the largest population in the world. Available resources should be properly arranged according to the severity of the disease epidemics. STDs have become the most severe diseases, especially AIDS and syphilis. During the 10-year period, 273 081 AIDS cases, 3 235 858 syphilis cases, and 1 253 861 gonorrhoea cases were reported in the system. Deaths caused by AIDS increased dramatically, accounting for 78% of all deaths caused by the class B notifiable diseases in 2014. The number of reported syphilis cases increased 3.26 times from 135 210 in 2005 to 441 818 in 2014.
