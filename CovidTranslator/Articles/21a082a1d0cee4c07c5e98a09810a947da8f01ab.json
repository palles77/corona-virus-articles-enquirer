Severe inflammation caused by zymogen activation can eventually lead to multiple organ dysfunctions which contribute to the high mortality rate of severe acute pancreatitis. However, there is no specific treatment available for acute pancreatitis therapy. Here, we show that spautin-1, which effectively inhibits autophagy flux, ameliorated the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis induced by cerulein or L-arginine. CaMKII phosphorylation due to cytosolic calcium overload was revealed in this paper. It was also demonstrated that autophagic protein aggregates degradation blockade accompanied by impaired autophagy correlated positively with intra-acinar cell digestive aymogen activation stimulated by cerulein or L-arginine. The role of spautin-1 in ameliorating acute pancreatitis was shown here to be associated with impaired autophagy inhibition and Ca 2+ overload alleviation. We provide a promising therapy for acute pancreatitis through targeting both impaired autophagy and increased cytosolic calcium.",

In the model of acute pancreatitis induced by alcohol together with lipopolysaccharides (LPS), it was found that the fusion ratio between autophagysome and lysosome decreased due to local lysosome-associated membrane protein 2 (LAMP2) deficiency in inflamed pancreatic tissue (19) . Almost at the same time, it was demonstrated that autophagy flux inhibition led to an imbalance between cathepsin B and cathepsin C, which eventually stimulated trypsinogen activation in cerulein-induced acute pancreatitis (20) .

Moreover, this downregulation by spautin-1 occurs in a time-dependent manner ( Figure 2D ). Of note, the levels of ubiquitylated protein aggregates decreased in insoluble fraction but increased in soluble ubiquitination under spautin-1 treatment, which is consistent with the function of spautin-1 promoting ubiquitination ( Figures 2C, D) .

Results showed that the level of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 form II (LC3II) (a marker of autophagy) increased when cells were treated with only cerulein or CQ ( Figure 1A) . However, there were no further increments in LC3II level under the conditions of treatment with both cerulein and CQ ( Figure 1A ). This suggests that autophagy could be blocked in pancreatic acinar cells under cerulein treatment. Similar results were obtained for L-arginine-treated pancreatic acinar cells ( Figure 1B) .",

Consistent with the increased level of LC3II, the level of p62 gradually elevated with the time and dose of cerulein treatment ( Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1A ) or L-arginine treatment ( Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure S1B ). Since ubiquitylated protein aggregates are transported into autophagysome for degradation by p62, we also investigated the effect of cerulein or L-arginine on the ubiquitination of protein aggregates. Results from Western blotting revealed that ubiquitination of protein aggregates was upregulated significantly in insoluble fraction; while soluble ubiquitination remained almost constant (Figures 1A-D; Supplementary  Figures S1A, S1B) . Compared to LC3II, p62 and ubiquitylated protein aggregates, the level of Beclin1 expression (an autophagy flux positive regulator) slightly increased (Figures 1C, D; Supplementary  Figures S1A, S1B) . To further confirm the relationship between impaired autophagy and the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis, we performed an in vitro reaction catalyzed by trypsin from pancreatic acinar cells. It was found that trypsin activity in acinar cells gradually increased with increasing levels of LC3II and p62 (Figures 1E, F; Supplementary Figures  S1C, S1D) .

Autophagy responsible for engulfing zymogen is referred to zymophagy, which was inhibited by 3-MA leading to acinar cell death (28) . Besides, more trypsin activity was found in Atg5ko mice recently (43) . Taken together, these two seemingly controversial evidence suggest the hypothesis put forward here, that damage in pancreatic tissue inducing autophagy which eliminates the protein or organelle with injury benefits cells survival at the beginning, when the damage is supra the extent that the system can stand, impaired autophagy occurs which causes the activation of trypsinogen. In the previous research (16) Atg5 had not been fully knocked out, thus autophagy still existed in Atg5ko mice. In this case, damage still could be eliminated at the early stage of pancreatitis but a lower level of impaired autophagy was induced at the later stage which resulted in a decreased level of trypsinogen activation. However, autophagy was largely inhibited in mice with high deficiency of Atg5 resulting in damage accumulation from the beginning, which induced more trypsinogen activation (43) . Thus whether autophagy is beneficial or not depends on the phases of the acute pancreatitis early stage. This hypothesis is still under exploration.",

LC3II as indicative of autophagy located in the inner membrane of the autolysosome.

Our results indicated that the increased level of LC3II in pancreatic acinar cells upon cerulein or L-arginine treatment was mainly due to the inhibition of autophagy flux. Another evidence for impaired autophagy in pancreatitis is that the change of autophagy flux positive regulator beclin1 is minor. It needs to be mentioned that LC3I shared a similar trend as LC3II under cerulein or L-arginine treatment. We can easily understand the fluctuations of LC3II, which is the actual autophagy indicator for most cases. LC3I can be upregulated when autophagy is blocked (38) , hence it sharing a similar trend as LC3II. The functioning of autophagy independently of LC3I has also been revealed (39, 40) .

Here, we detected cytosolic calcium using calcium sensitive dye fluo-4-AM and found that cytosolic calcium was elevated in ceruleinor L-arginine-treated AR42J cells in vitro ( Figures 4A, B) . Because calcium overload can result in trypsinogen preactivation in acute pancreatitis (34) , calcium chelator BAPTA-AM was used to conform the relationship between calcium elevation and trypsinogen activation in the present study. Correspondingly, trypsinogen activation in acinar cells was alleviated under the conditions of BAPTA-AM ( Figures 4C, D) .",

To answer this, we first evaluated fluorescence intensity in pancreatic acinar cells with or without spautin-1 treatment and found spautin-1 significantly diminished cytosolic calcium load caused by cerulein or L-arginine ( Figures 4E, F) . We next analyzed the changes of CaMKII (including its phosphorylation form) in pancreatic acinar cells treated with cerulein or L-arginine. Results showed that the phosphorylation of CaMKII gradually increased with the time and dose of cerulein or L-arginine treatment, but the level of CaMKII changed only slightly (Figures 4G,  H; Supplementary Figures S3A, S3B) . Interestingly, this increasing phosphorylation level induced by cerulein or L-arginine would decrease under the conditions of spautin-1 treatment (Figure 4I, J) . Together, these data further supported that spautin-1 ameliorating the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis might be correlated with relieving calcium overload.",
