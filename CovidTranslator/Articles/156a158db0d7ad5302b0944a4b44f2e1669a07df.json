Even though well-known, efficacious responses are available for the control and prevention of these diseases, the capacity for timely detection, confirmation and response actions needs reliable public health systems. To address the demand from countries for improved surveillance systems that provide relevant and accurate epidemiologic and laboratory information, the Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Headquarters for Africa (AFRO) adopted a strategy in 1998 called Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) [2] . A major goal of IDSR is to strengthen district-level surveillance capacities for detecting, confirming and responding to priority diseases that afflict African communities. In the IDSR implementation framework, epidemiologic surveillance is linked with laboratory support in order to produce relevant information for taking public health action [3] .",

For example, the district hospital laboratories submit weekly reports of selected priority diseases. The district level performs commonly requested laboratory tests such as hematology, clinical chemistry, urine analysis and parasitology. At the health center level, laboratories perform microscopy for detecting malaria, tuberculosis and other bacterial and parasitic agents. Almost all health center laboratories have the capacity to do human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) rapid testing. For some disease programs such as malaria, the network extends to the community level where volunteers are trained in detection and treatment of malaria including home-based management of malaria. The community volunteers contribute to surveillance activities by referring patients to health centers for laboratory services.",

The results are fed back to the districts and also shared with WHO/AFRO on a monthly basis. Decentralization of services was also implicated in expansion of access to antiretroviral treatment (ART) at the national level. Following the Rwanda National Paediatric Conference in 2004, there was recognition that early infant diagnosis of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) and ART sites should be expanded at all levels of the health system. In July 2005, with support from CDC, three paediatric diagnostic sites were established for early infant diagnosis using either dried blood spots (DBS) or whole blood methods. By April 2008, the number of rapid diagnostic sites had expanded to 126.",

According to the 2007 annual report from the Rwanda Treatment and Research AIDS Center (TRAC), the number of sites for paediatric treatment (PMTCT) increased markedly between 2003 and 2007; there were 53 in 2003, 120 in 2004, 209 in 2005, 234 in 2006 and 285 in 2007.

Health Research Policy and Systems 2011, 9:27 http://www.health-policy-systems.com/content/9/1/27 Laboratory capacity for HIV is one of the most developed services in Rwanda, with major financial and technical support from the United States Government's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) through CDC, other US Government organizations, the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University, the Global Fund, UNICEF and others. The NRL, located in Kigali, is equipped to perform the necessary biological tests required for the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up of HIV/AIDS patients including HIV rapid tests, viral load, and PCR. The NRL plays a leading role in organizing and setting up new HIV laboratory services (such as monitoring HIV treatment resistance), training, supervision, data management, and operational research. The capacities for polymerase reaction (PCR), CD4 and viral load measurements have been available at the NRL since 2004. These capacities were expanded through collaboration with partners due to decentralization by providing services for fluorescence-activated cell sorting including FACS Count\u2122 and FACS Calibur\u2122 instruments. For example, two FACS Calibur\u2122 instruments are at the NRL, 23 are in district hospitals and one is at a private research clinic in Kigali. At the end of 2005, the NRL performed nearly 70% of all CD4 counts conducted in the country. By 2007-2008, this figure from the NRL dropped to 36% due to increased capacity to conduct CD4 counts in 23 district hospitals. Plans are under way to upgrade the FACS\u2122 Count instrument for assessing lymphocyte percentages for infants.",
