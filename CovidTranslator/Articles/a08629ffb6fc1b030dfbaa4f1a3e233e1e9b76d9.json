After biotinylation of apical or basolateral surfaces of confluent monolayers grown on polycarbonate filters, GPI-anchored proteins are identified by their shift from a Triton X-114 detergentrich phase to a detergent-poor phase in the presence of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. All GPI-anchored proteins detected (3-9 per cell type, at least 13 different proteins) are found to be apically polarized; no GPI-anchored protein is observed preferentially localized to the basal surface. One of the GPI-anchored proteins is identified as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Survey of MDCK II-RCA r, a mutant cell line with a pleiotropic defect in galactosylation ofglycoproteins and glycolipids (that presumably affects GPI anchors) also reveals an apical polarization of all GPI-anchored proteins. In contrast, analysis of MDCK II-ConA r (a mutant cell line with an unknown defect in glycosylation) revealed five GPI-anchored proteins, two of which appeared relatively unpolarized. Our results indicate that the polarized apical distribution of GPI-anchored proteins is highly conserved across species and tissue-type and may depend on glycosylation.",

However, in epithelial cells some plasma membrane proteins are sorted in the Golgi apparatus into apically or basolaterally tar-geted vesicles, which implies that at least one of these pathways to the cell surface is signal mediated (reviewed by Wandinger-Ness & Simons, 1989) .

The experimental approach (Table  1) combined domain-selective labeling using a membrane/tight junction impermeant marker (sulfo-NHS-biotin), with TX-114 phase separation and PI-PLC release of GPI-anchored proteins from the detergent into the aqueous phase. In the original assay , this release overlapped with a background level of spontaneous protein partitioning into the aqueous phase which partially obscured the action of PI-PLC. This background release was attributed to the inefficiency inherent in TX-114 phase separation; the aqueous phase retains 0.7 mM TX-114, which is 3x above the critical micellar concentration of this detergent and is sufficient to solubilize certain membrane proteins of intermediate hydrophobicity (Pryde, 1986) . Accordingly, we used a hydrophobic resin in an attempt to Table 2 remove both residual TX-114 and hydrophobic proteins without affecting the soluble (hydrophilic) set of GPI-anchored proteins released by PI-PLC. Phenyl-Sepharose had been employed previously to distinguish between hydrophobic and hydrophilic forms of trehalase and decay accelerating factor (both GPI-anchored proteins) (Takesue et al., 1986; Davitz et al., 1987) . Figure la (left panel) shows that addition of phenyl-Sepharose (step 5 in Table 1 ) drastically removed proteins that partition spontaneously into the aqueous phase without affecting PI-PLC specific release. Removal of spontaneously released proteins correlated well with the loss of detergent, suggesting that these proteins were kept in solution by TX-114 in the aqueous phase. This simple step greatly increased the sensitivity of detection of GPI-anchored proteins allowing a more stringent assessment of their polarized apical distribution.",

MDCK, type I, \"high resistance strain\" (transmonolayer electrical resistance [TER] > 1,000 9 cm 2) comprises a basolateral surface with 7.6x the area of the apical surface; in contrast, MDCK, type II, \"low resistance strain\" (TER I00-200 f~ 9 cm 2) has a basolateral surface with 2.8-4.0 x area of the apical surface (von Bonsdorff et al., 1985; Vega-Salas et al., 1987) .

Confluent monolayers were biotinylated from the apical or the basolateral side, extracted with TX-114 and treated with PI-PLC, according to the protocol described in Table 1 . All three cell lines showed a polarized apical distribution of GPI-anchored proteins. Analysis of MDCK, type I, revealed six GPI-anchored proteins of the same molecular weights previously detected for MDCK, type II, (110, 85, 70, 55, 38 and 35 kDa) (Fig. 2a , left panel) although in different relative proportions. Scanning densitometry (Fig. 2b, left panel) indicated that, as in MDCK II cells, GPI-anchored proteins were predominantly (71.7->99%) apical (Table 2). No basolaterally polarized GPI-anchored proteins were observed; however, a larger percentage of these proteins was detected on the basolateral surface, probably due to the larger area of this surface domain in MDCK I cells. It should be noted that although possession of similar molecular weights is not definitive proof of the identity of apical and basolateral bands, if putative basolaterally Confluent epithelial cell monolayers were biotinylated, extracted with TX-114 and treated with PI-PLC/phenyl-Sepharose sequentially.

Since additional glycosylation (galactosylation and mannosylation) of the GPI-glycan moiety may vary Homans et al., 1988) , we investigated whether it plays a role in generating the polarized apical distribution of GPI-anchored proteins in epithelial cells. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of a lectin-resistant mutant cell line, MDCK II-RCA r, which contains a pleiotropic defect in galactosylation, while retaining the polarized epithelial cell phenotype (Meiss, Green & Rodriguez-Boulan, 1982; Brandli et al., 1988) . The pleiotropic nature of the defect (affecting both N-and Olinked glycosylation, as well as glycosphingolipid synthesis) apparently results from defective uptake of UDP-galactose by the Golgi complex. Four GPIanchored proteins were observed ( Fig. 4a) with apparent molecular weights (65, 50, 35 and 30 kDa) lower than those of corresponding wild-type MDCK GPI-anchored proteins (consistent with the possession of truncated carbohydrate side chains). The percentage apical polarity ranged from 73.6 to 91.8 (Table 2) , somewhat lower than in wild-type MDCK cells. All appeared in a polarized apical distribution, with only the most abundant GPI-anchored proteins showing basolateral counterparts of identical molecular weight and reduced intensity (Fig. 4b) . Our results suggest that galactosylation is not required for the polarized apical expression of GPI-anchored proteins. We next examined another lectin-resistant mutant cell line, MDCK II-ConA r, which contains an unknown glycosylation defect. Comparison of VSV G-protein and influenza HA produced by infection of this cell line has suggested that this mutation affects only a subclass of core high-mannose oligosaccharides, possibly those not destined for processing into complex forms (Meiss et al., 1982) . A similar differential effect is observed in processing of Nlinked oligosaccharides by a class E Thy-1 negative lymphoma cell line (also derived by ConA r, Chapman, Fujimoto & Kornfeld, 1980) , which contains a pleiotropic defect in GPI-anchoring and secretes a hydrophilic form of Thy-1 (a GPI-anchored protein) into the culture media (Conzelmann et al., 1986) .",

However, two bands (55 and 35 kDa) seemed relatively unpolarized with 31.7 to 45.4% appearing on the basolateral surface ( Fig. 5b; Table 2 ). Other bands (85, 70 and 38 kDa) remained highly apically polarized as in wild-type cells (with 91.9 to >99% confined to the apical surface). These results indicate that a de-fect in glycosylation can affect the polarity of certain GPI-anchored proteins. Such a change in polarity may be the direct result of an alteration in GPI-anchor biosynthesis/side chain addition or secondary to alterations in N-linked oligosaccharide processing. GPI-anchored proteins that remained highly polarized may be sorted based on information present in their extracellular domains, since redundant apical targeting information can be present in the ectodomain of a GPI-anchored protein . Table 2 summarizes the apparent molecular weights and percentage apical polarity of the GPIanchored proteins detected in the seven cell lines analyzed. A cumulative minimum of 13 different GPI-anchored proteins (based on distinct molecular weights) were detected and all appeared apically polarized. It should be noted that virtually identical results were obtained when monolayers (of all seven cell lines) were serum starved for 12-t6 hr (data not shown). These results suggest that the observed polarized apical distribution of GPI-anchored proteins is independent of serum factors, which, either directly (e.g., proteases or H-specific phospholipases) or indirectly (hormones, growth factors stimulating anchor degrading enzymes) might contribute to this polarity by acting preferentially on one epithelial surface.",

The results of this report describe a strong correlation between possession of a GPI-anchor and apical polarization of a protein in epithelial cells. To survey the surface distribution of GPI-anchored proteins in polarized epithelial cells, we employed a domain-selective labeling procedure and a sensitive assay that depends upon several conserved structural features of the GPI-membrane anchor . Domain-selective labeling with the cell surface/tight junction impermeant marker, sulfo-NHS-biotin, allows for the analysis of apical and basolateral membrane components without the need for complex subcellular fractionation and the burden of possible cross-contamination.

This diverse group includes cells with canine, porcine and human origins which express certain features of renal (proximal tubule, distal tubule) or intestinal (enterocytic, colonic) epithelia in vivo. All GPI-anchored proteins detected in the five cell lines displayed a polarized apical distribution. No GPI-anchored proteins with a preferred basolateral distribution were observed. The detection of basolateral counterparts of apical GPI-anchored proteins was roughly related to the basolateral/apical surface area ratio, since it was more evident in MDCK I (B/A ratio = 7.6, von Bonsdorff et al., 1985) and SK-CO15 cells (which also have a well-developed basolateral surface, Le than in MDCK II cells (B/A ratio 2.8-4) and minimal in cell lines with extensive brush-border development such as LLC-PKI (B/A ratio 1-1.5, Pfaller et al., 1988) and Caco-2 (Pinto et al., 1983; Hauri et ai., 1985) . These results are con-sistent with our preliminary observations with the low resistance MDCK II subline and with the apical polarity of several wellknown endogenous and recombinantly expressed GPI-anchored proteins (Kollias et al., 1987; Low & Saltiel, 1988; Brown et al., 1989; . In fact, some of these markers (renal dipeptidase [130 kDa], trehalase [96 kDa], 5'nucleotidase [73 kDa] and alkaline phosphatase [58-70 kDa]) are present in the cell lines we studied (Gstraunthaler, 1988) and have similar molecular weights to the GPI-anchored proteins we detected. The emerging picture is that the apical polarity of GPI-anchored proteins is observed in a variety of epithelial cells derived from different tissues and species and constitutes a highly conserved feature of the polarized epithelial cell phenotype.",

However, considerable structural heterogeneity also exists, even within a single cell type. Elucidation of the complete structure of the GPI-anchors of two distinct glycoproteins, the T. brucei variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) and rat brain Thy-1, revealed extensive differences in side chain groups on the glycan moiety Homans et al., 1988) . More specifically, the Thy-1 GP! anchor contained extra ethanolamine phosphate, c~-mannose and /3-N-acetyl galactosamine residues, but lacked the 2-4 o~-galactose residues normally observed for the GPI anchor of VSG. Synthesis of the GPI anchor appears to occur via glycosylation of phosphatidylinositol (by the sequential addition of glucosamine, mannose and ethanolamine-P) with the addition of other sugars occurring later, possibly after attachment to the C-terminal of the mature protein (Masterson et al., 1989) . A putative precursor lipid, that may give rise to the GPI anchor, lacks galactose, suggesting that galactosylation occurs after synthesis (Krakow et al., 1986; Menon et al., 1988; Masterson et al., 1989) possibly at the level of the Golgi apparatus (Grab, Webster & Verjee, 1984) . Thus, GPI anchors may have a common core structure in a variety of cell types, but variation can be expressed in side chain moieties without a loss of GPI anchoring. The preferred apical distribution of GPIanchored proteins in the lectin-resistant mutant cell line, MDCK II-RCA r, which contains a pleiotropic defect in galactosylation, suggests that galactose residues are not required to generate this polarity. (It seems unlikely that such a pleiotropic defect would spare GPI biosynthesis and processing.) In contrast, two of five GPI-anchored proteins in the mutant cell line, MDCK II-ConA r, appeared relatively unpolarized. Although the underlying defect is not known for this cell line, it appears to involve mannosylation (Meiss et al., 1982) . This is especially interesting since another form of mannosylation, mannose-6-phosphate, acts as a targeting signal for lysosomal enzymes (Sly, 1982) . Perhaps mannosylation of the side chain moiety of the GPI anchor contributes to efficient apical localization.",

First, enzymatic modification at the basolateral surface might render them undetectable by the criterion of PI-PLC specific release. Such modifications might include cleavage of the GPI membrane anchor and subsequent secretion (Chan et al., 1988) , or acylation of the inositol ring rendering GPI-anchored proteins insensitive to PI-PLC treatment (Roberts et al., 1988) , thereby escaping detection by our assay system. Although not directly studied in this work, this possibility appears unlikely since application of alternative polarity assays (e.g., immunocytochemistry or immunoprecipitation of specific endogenous or transfected GPI-anchored proteins from monolayers biotinylated from the apical or the basolateral side) invariably detect the apical distribution of GPI-linked proteins . GPI-anchored decay accelerating factor (DAF, Davitz et al., 1987; Medof et al., 1987) introduced via transfection into MDCK cells is expressed on the apical surface while no DAF molecules are released to the basal medium, as measured by a sensitive RIA . Thus, all the available evidence taken together indicates that the apical polarity of GPI-anchored proteins is not artifactual, but a feature of the polarized epithelial cell phenotype.",

Work by several laboratories (reviewed by van Meer, 1988; van Meer & Si-mons, 1988) has demonstrated that several glycolipids are enriched two to 10-fold in the apical surface, presumably through sorting in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (van Meet et al., 1987) . This has led to the hypothesis that the sorting of glycolipids and apical proteins may be linked (van Meet & Simons, 1988; Wandinger-Ness & Simons, 1989) . Since some glycolipids have a high tendency towards self-aggregation (Thompson & Tillack, 1985) , apical proteins might be sorted through their affinity for glycolipid patches in the TGN, which would allow their incorporation into apical carrier vesicles. GPI-anchored proteins might be sorted through the affinity of GPI for the glycolipid patches (Rodriguez-Boulan & Nelson, 1989) . Biophysical and biochemical dissection of the possible sorting role of GPI may provide useful insights on how the sorting of epithelial plasma membrane proteins is carried out.",

Since the lectin-resistant mutant cell line, MDCK II-RCA\", contains a pleiotropic defect in galactosylation (affecting both glycosphingolipid synthesis and protein glycosylation), our results suggest that galactosylation is not required for the polarized apical expression of GPI-anchored proteins~ Lanes 3 and 4 are also shown at half the exposure time (as lanes 5 and 6) to partially correct for the larger surface area of the basolateral surface. Molecular mass standards are as indicated in Fig. 1 (left panel). (b) Densitometric analysis. The above autoradiograph was scanned and lanes corresponding to PI-PLC treated samples (+) and untreated controls ( -) automatically subtracted. (A) Apically biotinylated, lane 2 minus lane 1. (B) Basolaterally biotinylated, lane 4 minus lane 3. Peaks numbered 1-4 correspond to 65, 50, 35 and 30 kDa, respectively",
