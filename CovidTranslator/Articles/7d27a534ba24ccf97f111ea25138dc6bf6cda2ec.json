            "text": "Acute respiratory infections are estimated to cause 3.9 million deaths annually; many present as influenza-like illnesses (ILI) 1 which can be caused by many different respiratory viruses. In patients with asthma, respiratory viral infections lead to exacerbations, potentially placing the patient's life at risk and creating an economic burden to the patient, to the health system and society 2 . Asthma exacerbations are responsible for half the cost of the disease and for 5000 deaths in the United States, every year 3 . Several reviews suggest that viral infections are present in up to 50% of adult exacerbations and over 60% of pediatric exacerbations 4, 5, 6 It is estimated that the prevalence of asthma in Mexico is around 5% 7; however, there are no estimates of the economic impact of an asthma exacerbation. Despite strong evidence linking viral infections to asthma exacerbations, the mechanisms by which viral infections trigger exacerbations are not fully understood 8. Despite \"virus-induced exacerbation\" being frequently used, there are few studies demonstrating this viral involvement in asthma exacerbation 9, 10, 11 . The association between viral infections and asthma exacerbations leads to questions regarding why some patients develop severe exacerbations and others do not. It is known that in hospitalized patients with ILI, a comorbidity associated with severity is asthma. We hypothesized that certain viral infections, patterns of ILI symptoms, and laboratory values may identify patients that develop severe asthma exacerbations that require subsequent hospitalization.",

Participants were enrolled in six Hospitals, five in Mexico City and one in the central city of San Luis Potos\u00ed. Recruitment occurred year round and participants were enrolled in the study if they had at least one respiratory symptom and at least one of the following general symptoms: fever or feverishness, malaise, headache, myalgia, and/or chest pain. Once enrolled, participants had a baseline study visit to collect information on demographics, medical history, laboratory tests and clinical care needed (outpatient, hospitalization, intensive care admission). Follow up visits were carried out on days 14 and 28 where information on hospitalization, if any, was collected. This study was approved by the IRB of each participating institution; all study procedures were performed after obtaining the written patient informed consent and corresponding written assent if appropriate.",

            "text": "While it is generally accepted that viral infections can be associated with asthma exacerbations, there is controversy about how frequently exacerbations are triggered by viral infections. Some studies report an association, particularly among children, while others have not found that viruses are associated with asthma exacerbation 16, 17, 18 . Multiple studies have implicated rhinovirus as an important trigger, especially among children. Rhinovirus infections were found to be associated with hospital readmissions attributed to asthma among children less than 13 years old, a frequent cause of hospital admission due to asthma among children less than five years old 19 , and associated with asthma exacerbations among children 2-17 years old 20, 21 It has also been suggested that members of the Rhinovirus family might be more virulent and/or have a greater propensity to cause exacerbation 22, 23 . Given the aforementioned studies, we suspect that we were unable to detect an association because our patient population is mainly adults, and therefore our results are most relevant to adults with asthma, perhaps we did not find a stronger association as all participants had ILI. Our findings suggest that viral infections alone are not the only contributors to adult asthma exacerbations, and efforts should instead be made to assess other factors known to be involved in severe exacerbations, Asthma control 13, 24, 25, 26, 27 and environmental allergens 28 together with viral infections are likely responsible for the risk factors for hospital admission 11 .",

Our findings mirror those from a recent study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) evaluation of the 2009 influenza pandemic, where they found that while most adults with underlying medical conditions were more likely to report ILI, they were not more likely to seek urgent medical attention compared with those who did not have an underlying medical condition 29 .

Lymphocytopenia has been shown to be more closely associated with viral infections 30 . The presence of increased leukocytes and neutrophils may be associated with the heterogeneous inflammatory response, possibly attributable to pre-existing inflammation due to asthma that might be worsened by exposure to the virus. Production of chemokines by bronchial epithelium in response to a viral infection leads to the entry of neutrophils to the respiratory airways, as confirmed on experimental and naturally induced common cold among asthmatic patients 31 . Neutrophilia in the airways is associated with increased levels of elastase IL-6 and IL-8 and LDH, a marker of epithelial injury, but also with bacterial exacerbations. Therefore, it is not always clear which mechanism drives the neutrophil elevation. While these laboratory parameters are consistent with the high prevalence of viral infections among our patient population, these responses can also be seen in bacterial infections 31, 32 . Our results suggest that in patients with asthma and ILI, these laboratory tests might be useful to predict severe exacerbations, although we were not able to determine if these increases occurred before the exacerbation and whether the patient is suffering from a viral or bacterial infection.",

In our population nearly 40% of participants were overweight/obese. However, after adjusting for age, current tobacco use and sex, we did not find an association with exacerbations. Asthma exacerbations are closely tied to asthma control, and the evidence linking obesity to asthma controls is mixed, with studies supporting 34, 35, 36, 37, 38 and refuting an association 39, 40, 41 . A Cochrane review of weight loss interventions to improve asthma control concluded that there may be weak associations but noted that research in this area is lacking 42 .

First, since this is a secondary data analysis of an ILI study, participants were selected if they met criteria for ILI. Therefore, our findings are not generalizable to other types of asthma exacerbations, such as allergen, pollutant, cold, or exercise-induced exacerbations. Asthma was self-reported with no information being collected on accuracy of diagnosis, prescribed medications or adequacy of asthma symptom control. Information regarding environmental exposures was not collected beyond cigarette use and exposure, or on pulmonary function. This information might have been valuable to accurately classify participants, particularly those with mild exacerbations. We also only have information on asthma symptoms on the day of recruitment, and do not have data on symptoms prior to or after enrollment into the study. For this reason, there may be some misclassification of exacerbation status. However, we have no reason to believe that the misclassification bias is informative and thus only reduces the precision, but not the accuracy of our estimates.
