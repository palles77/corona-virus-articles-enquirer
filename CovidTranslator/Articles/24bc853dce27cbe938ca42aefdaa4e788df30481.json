Diarrhea caused by salmonellosis can lead to substantially higher mortality in outbreaks, particularly in calves within the first few weeks of life. 1 Preventing these early-life Salmonella infections is particularly difficult because no vaccines are labeled for use in young calves. Extra-label use of commercially available vaccines has not been effective 2 and is anecdotally associated with clinically relevant adverse effects. Colostral immunity stimulated by vaccinating dry cows for Escherichia coli, rotavirus, and coronavirus has been used extensively in the dairy and beef industries to protect calves against diarrhea challenge. 3, 4 Previous data also indicate that vaccination of dry cows can decrease fecal shedding of Salmonella in young calves. [5] [6] [7] However, the concept of using dry cow vaccination to decrease clinical disease caused by Salmonella in calves has not been well examined.",

The spontaneous potential difference (PD) was measured using Ringer-agar bridges, and the PD was shortcircuited using a voltage clamp that corrected for fluid resistance. If the spontaneous PD was between \u22121.0 and 1.0 mV, tissues were current clamped at \u00b1100 \u03bcA for 5 seconds, and the PD was recorded. Transepithelial electrical resistance (\u03a9\u00c1cm 2 ) was calculated from the spontaneous PD and short-circuit current (Isc). Automated measurements of PD and Isc were taken every 20 seconds over an hour. The mean TER for each tissue starting at 15 minutes was calculated for each calf to account for changes associated with equilibration in the chambers.

[18] [19] [20] Our finding that there was no difference in TER between the CTL and VAX calves suggests similar severity of epithelial damage, which is supported by the histologic scoring. It is unclear why no differences were found for any measured outcomes despite increased titers in the VAX group. Little data exist about what constitutes a protective titer in calves, but potentially the titers in our study were not high enough to be protective. Additionally, we did not measure titers at the time of infection, and the reported titers may not truly reflect the status of the calves at 2 weeks of age. In most of the studies discussed above, Salmonella challenge occurred between 2 and 5 days of age, and perhaps protection from colostral immunity had waned significantly by the time we challenged the calves in our study (days [10] [11] [12] . The rate of decay for colostral antibodies does appear to vary for different pathogens, 22 and the persistence of colostrum-derived Salmonella immunoglobulins from this subunit vaccine is unknown. If rapid immunoglobulin elimination is the reason for the lack of protection, using passive transfer of immunity to prevent salmonellosis in neonatal calves is unlikely to be a successful strategy.",

This observation suggests that these maternal cells may play a role in \"training\" or \"priming\" the developing immune system of the calf. Therefore, it is possible that the feeding of fresh colostrum to calves from cows vaccinated for Salmonella Newport would have produced better protection in this challenge model.",

The isolate used was obtained from a necropsy sample, and was associated with substantial mortality in our study. Potentially, some protection may have been seen had a less pathogenic isolate been used. Furthermore, the dose of Salmonella administered may be higher than that typically encountered in the clinical situation. Unfortunately, other isolates and lower inoculation doses without abomasal alkalization did not reliably induce clinical disease in a small pilot study before this trial. The 2 cycles of freezing and thawing of the colostrum could have decreased the IgG content of the colostrum that was fed, and decreased any protective effect in the calves. Regardless, the colostrum from vaccinated cows did induce a significant increase in serum titers in the VAX group. We did not assess transfer of passive immunity in the calves. Although every effort was made to optimize transfer of colostral antibodies in both groups, there could have been differences in the total IgG transferred, which may have influenced our results. Several limitations to this study limit the conclusions that can be drawn. First, the cows were not randomly allocated to VAX or CTL groups. This could have inadvertently biased the overall colostral quality in 1 group because this was not assessed. Second, calves were not randomly allocated to treatment groups before the study. Because treatments were randomly applied to the calves as they were born, this approach should have limited the bias introduced by this error, but we cannot rule out the possibility that this approach inadvertently influenced our findings. Measurement of passive transfer of immunity in the calves would have provided some assurance that the lack of randomization did not bias our findings, but this measurement was not done.",

We erroneously calculated sample size by treating mortality as a continuous instead of a binary variable. Because of this error, the likelihood of missing a difference in mortality when a difference truly exists is increased. The lack of appropriate randomization and sample size calculation preclude the application of these findings to clinical practice, but the results still are valuable to inform future investigations.",

The majority of these samples were positive in both groups, indicating rapid spread from the intestinal lumen into the submucosa, draining lymph nodes, and gall bladder. These findings are supported by the histologic, immunohistochemical and ex vivo assessments of intestinal damage. Spread of Salmonella in calves is primarily via the fecal oral route. 12 Therefore, reduction in fecal shedding by calves could be of benefit in controlling the infection on farms. Unfortunately, there was no measureable impact of feeding colostrum from vaccinated cows on the number of calves shedding Salmonella or the number of days that calves were fecal positive for Salmonella. Similar numbers of calves still were culture positive at necropsy as well. Ussing chambers have been used for over 50 years to maintain the viability of epithelia ex vivo in order to investigate ion transport and barrier function, leading to fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of diarrhea. 16 With the Ussing chamber, resistance to movement of ions across the epithelium can be calculated as the reciprocal of the measured conductance. This measurement (TER) provides a sensitive measure of tissue integrity, 16 because changes are almost exclusively a result of loss of intercellular tight junctions and",
