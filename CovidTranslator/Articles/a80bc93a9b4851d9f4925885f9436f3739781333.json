Morphologically and functionally, the Golgi complex has a distinct ,polarity (Farquhar and Palade, 1981) . Newly synthesized membrane and secretory proteins coming from the ER enter the Golgi through the cis face, traverse across the stack, and leave via the trans face. A reticulum of tubules Iemanating from the trans-most cisterna, collectively referred to as the trans-Golgi network (TGN) or trans-Golgi reticulum, probably reflects the actual sites of exit (Griffiths ,and Simons, 1986; Geuze and MorrB, 1991) . On route ,through the Golgi, newly synthesized glycoproteins are subjected to a series of posttranslational modifications, most notably the ordered remodeling of their N-linked oli-gosaccharide side chains and biosynthesis of O-linked glycans.",

Accordingly, enzymes involved in the early Golgi events in terminal N-glycosylation-such as the trimming of the high mannose chain to its mans form by mannosidase l-have been placed in the cis Golgi (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985; Pelham, 1989) . Enzymes involved in intermediate steps, such as the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine to the mans sugars (GlcNAc transferase I), are thought to be restricted to medial cisternae (Dunphy et al., 1985) . Finally, enzymes that catalyze the addition of terminal galactose and sialic acid moieties (such as galactosyltransferase and sialyltransferase) are placed in trans cisternae and/or the TGN (Roth and Berger, 1982; Roth et al., 1985; Griffiths and Simons, 1986; Duncan and Kornfeld, 1988; Taatjes et al., 1988) . The scheme thus predicts that a series of sequential biochemical reactions occurs within separate compartments, through which glycoprotein substrates pass as if on an assembly line.",

In other words, the intercisternal transport vesicles may not selectively include components intended for transport. Rather, resident proteins of any one cisterna must be selectively excluded from entering these transport vesicles, most likely reflecting the selective retention of resident proteins in their appropriate cisternae. A few cellular and viral glycoproteins are known that appear to have such retention signals, resulting in their accumulation in the Golgi (Colley et al., 1989; Swift and Machamer, 1991; Nilsson et al., 1991; Munro, 1991) .",

The trans side is recognizable by maturing (Pg) and mature (g) secretory granules. The discontinuous profile of the fenestrated network is seen on the cis side (CE). Small vesicles are marked V and the endoplasmic reticulum is marked ER. Also notice areas where the stack is disrupted by discontinuities (48,500 x ). and endosomes are sequestered into clathrin-coated buds of the TGN, owing to specific recognition determinants (Kornfeld and Mellman, 1989; Pearse and Robinson, 1990) . Proteins lacking these signals, including soluble proteins destined for secretion, are by default packaged into transport vesicles of the constitutive pathway that are targeted to the plasma membrane. In the TGN of polarized or secretory cells (endocrine and exocrine secretory cells, epithelial cells, and neurons), other routes of exit may occur, leading to inclusion either within storage granules (Kelly, 1985; Huttner and Tooze, 1989) or within transport vesicles targeted specifically to the apical or basolateral plasma membranes (Bennett et al., 1988; Wandinger-Ness et al., 1990) or to the dendritic and axonal cell surfaces (Dotti and Simons, 1990) .",

What is less than clear, however, is the extent to which the Golgi is divided into distinct compartments. As mentioned earlier, some of the enzymes involved in early, intermediate, and late steps in the terminal glycosylation of N-linked sugar chains have been localized to one to three individual cisternae by electron microscopy using immunoperoxidase or immunogold cytochemistry (Roth and Berger, 1982; Slot and Geuze, 1983; Dunphy et al., 1985; Roth et al., 1985) . However, a definitive demonstration that these enzymes exist in separate cisternae can only be provided by visualizing two or more enzymes simultaneously. The Golgi complex in the cell is not the idealized stack that we are accustomed to recognize in diagrams, but it may be subject to twists that make individual sections difficult to interpret. To date, simultaneous localization of two or more enzymes has not been accomplished. In addition, the localization of key enzymes such as mannosidase I remains to be established; this is a critical unknown, since mannosidase I is thought to be the first glycosidase to modify N-linked oligosaccharides upon their arrival in the Golgi.",

However, interpretation of these data is limited on two accounts. First, in the absence of definitive immunocytochemical localization, it is impossible to know whether the different fractions correspond to different sets of cisternae. Second, the enzymes studied have been separated into only three fractions, the highest density fraclions containing enzymes acting early in glycosylation (glucosidase, enzymes involved in generating mannose 6-phosphates on lysosomal enzymes) and the lightest density fractions containing terminally acting glycosyltransferases (galactosyl and sialyltransferases). The five enzymes 1 hat are involved in \"intermediate\" processing steps (manrnosidase I and II, GlcNAc transferase I, II, and IV, and fucosyltransferase) were all found to cosediment in a single peak of intermediate density. Thus, although consistent with the existence of at least three physically and functionally distinct compartments, these observations also suggest that many of the carbohydrate processing steps may occur within a single compartment. Since the enzymes involved in N-glycosylation act sequentially (and specifically) (that is, mannosidase I creates the substrate for GlcNAc transferase, which creates the substrate for mannosidase II, which creates the substrate for galactosyltransferase, etc.), there is no a priori need for physical separation to ensure proper processing. Indeed, having GlcNAc transferase and galactosyltransferase in a common compartment would explain the existence of lactosamine repeats in the terminal chains of many glycoproteins (Cummings and Kornfeld, 1984; Howe et al., 1988) .",

Classically, membrane-bounded compartments have been viewed as comprising physically distinct entities each with its own distinct protein compositions and, presumably, unique functions. Accordingly, all of any one type of organelle can be considered a compartment, but so can a distinct region (or \"subcompartment\") within an organelle. By this criterion, compartment boundaries should be easily delineated by immunoelectron microscopic localization of resident marker proteins. However, this simple view is complicated by several factors. For example, even the localization of two Golgi enzymes to different cisternae by double label immunoelectron microscopy might not unequivocally demonstrate that they are present in physically distinct compartments. Such a distribution of enzymes could reflect the existence of subdomains in an otherwise continuous membrane array, analogous to the lateral heterogeneity found between the rough and the smooth ER. Conversely, markers may be segregated into physically distinct membranes that nevertheless remain functionally continuous by repeated membrane fissions and fusions or transient tubular interconnections. The existence of such homotypic interactions-interactions among \"like\" elements-would play an important role in preserving continuity among equivalent but physically separated organelles. Thus, the simple test of localizing different markers to distinct membranes cannot by itself serve to identify distinct compartments.",

Given that there is likely to be continuous transport and recycling of membrane components between such compartments, compartment identities are not static and therefore may not always be entirely biochemically distinct.

Conceivably, endogenous (or resident) components may be defined by their ability to interact with a compartment-specific structural framework, such as a cytosolic membrane coat or skeleton. It is clear that only by identifying the machinery responsible for entry into, retention within, or exit from a compartment will we be able to precisely and consistently determine compartment boundaries.

Assuming that distinct compartments are required to accomplish these functions, at least three compartments are required, defined here as the cis-Golgi network (CGN), the medial Golgi, and the TGN, respectively. Although the details of Golgi morphology vary considerably between different cell types, such a three compartment subdivision is generally consistent with the overall structural organization of the mammalian Golgi from threedimensional reconstructions (Rambourg and Clermont, 1990) (Figures 2 and 3) . It is also consistent with the functional organization of the Golgi in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which, on the basis of mutations affecting Golgi function, has recently been proposed toconsist of at least three compartments (Graham and Emr, 1991) .",

Structurally, however, the cis-most cisterna of the Golgi is typically associated with a continuous array of tubules that are selectively stained after prolonged osmication (Lindsey and Ellisman, 1985; Rambourg and Clermont, 1990) ( Figure 2 ). Given this distinctive morphology, and by analogy to the TGN, it seems appropriate to refer to this region as a distinct compartment called the CGN (Huttner and Tooze, 1989; Hsu et al., 1991; Pelham, 1991) . For several reasons, it also seems reasonable to suggest that the CGN also includes the poorly understood but possibly interconnected system of tubules between the ER and the Golgi, referred to as the \"salvage compartment\" (Warren, 1987; Pelham, 1991) (Figure 3 ). In addition to serving as a site of entry into the Golgi, recent evidence suggests that the CGN functions in the recycling of protein and lipid components back to the ER, while having a relatively limited role in glycosylation. Using both animal and yeast cells, Pelham and colleagues have found that soluble ER proteins containing the KDEL (or HDEL) ER retention marker are delivered to a post-ER The ports of exit are the sites from which proteins leave the ER. As discussed in the text, the \"intermediate compartment\" defined by the p53 and ~58 antigens probably consists both of the CGN, the ports of exit from the ER, and the carrier elements responsible for bidirectional transport between the ER and the CGN. The lateral arrows would be sites where direct fusions would interconnect CGN-CGN, medialmedial, and TGN-TGN compartments of two adjacent stacks. Compare these sites to the discontinuities in Figure 1 . site, in which little \"Golgi-like\" oligosaccharide processing oiccurs and from which these proteins are returned to the ER (Pelham, 1988 (Pelham, , 1989 Dean and Pelham, 1990) . In animal cells, the lysosomal enzyme cathepsin D was given a C-terminal KDEL tag and found not to receive any terminal sugar modifications associated with Golgi-linked glycosylation. However, mannose residues on the enzyme did receive a GlcNAc-phosphate. Thus, although the KDEL clonstruct reached a GlcNAc-phosphotransferase-containing compartment, it did not encounter mannosidase I, a glycosidase that would remove the phosphotransferase substrate. Although it may yet turn out that some KDEL proteins receive further oligosaccharide modifications, K.DEL receptors can retrieve these proteins before they reach the bulk of the oligosaccharide transferases; thus, recycling is a function associated with a distinct \"early\" Golgi compartment.",

These antigens label structures that appear to serve as intermediates in transport from the ER to the Golgi as well a.s in the recycling of Golgi components back to the ER (I-ippincott- Schwartz et al., 1990) . The markers also label presumed sites of exit from the ER (\"transitional elements,\" Palade, 1975) as well as the cis-most Golgi cisterna (Saraste and Svensson, 1991; Lotti et al., 1992) , suggesting that they are not endogenous CGN components, but recycle between the ER and CGN. Thus, the intermediate compartment probably comprises the exit sites from both the E.R and the CGN as well as the dynamic \"pool\" of vesicles and tubules that reflects the continuous recycling between tlhe two sites ( Figure 3) . Although incubation at low temperalture has also been used to delineate boundaries in this region, like all temperature blocks, forward transport is clependent on length of incubation, making precise interpretation even more difficult than usual.",

While distinct from the CGN or TGN, we assume that the medial cisternae represent a single functionally continuous compartment, irrespective of the actual number of physically separate cisternal elements in any one Golgi complex. Nevertheless, owing to the sidedness of the Golgi, the medial cisternae may appear structurally distinct. For example, since one face of a medial cisterna is apposed to the CGN while another face is apposed to the TGN, the two faces may have different compositions, owing to their interactions with structurally distinct compartments. Most of the glycosylation reactions (N-linked, O-linked, as well as glycolipid synthesis), aswell as polysaccharide synthesis normally associated with the Golgi, are viewed as occurring in the medial compartment. This arrangement would account for cell type heterogeneity in cisternal number and enzyme distribution by placing them all in asingle compartment. At present, there is insufficient data to know if this is really the case.",

Moreover, while the terminal transferases also have relatively high K,s for substrate (high micromolar range), they may work at rates that may exceed the rate of sugar nucleotide transport (Weinstein et al., 1982; C.

Such a function would contribute to the efficiency of forward transport by preventing passenger proteins and lipids from returning to the medial Golgi after reaching the TGN. In practice, this would predict that there is no recycling from the TGN to the medial Golgi. The need for this function is best illustrated by considering the transport and distribution of membrane lipids through the Golgi. Several lipids such as cholesterol, glycolipids, and sphingomyelin are present in very low concentrations in the ER, although they are abundant in the Golgi (van Meer, 1989) . If there were lipid recycling from each Golgi compartment, it would be difficult to account for these differences in lipid composition. Placing a valve in the pathway makes the lipid sorting problem easier to solve. Several studies have demonstrated directly that there is little backflow of glycoproteins from the TGN into proximal Golgi compartments (Duncan and Kornfeld, 1988; Neefjes et al., 1988; Chege and Pfeffer, 1990) . Also, recycling of glycosphingolipids through the TGN (Schwartzmann and Sandhoff, 1990) would be easier to explain if these plasma membrane lipids would not encouter medial Golgi enzymes; otherwise, with time, only complex glycolipids would be present on the cell surface.",

The second key element underlying our current view of the Golgi concerns the role of carrier vesicles in mediating transport through the Golgi complex. While transport vesicles may represent the most likely mechanism to accomplish transfer between compartments and/or individual cisternae, how strong is the evidence that they actually perform this function? In intact cells, perhaps the best argument comes from the early cell-cell fusion experiments of Rothman and colleagues (Rothman et al., 1984a (Rothman et al., , 1984b . Here, CHO cell glycosylation mutants were infected with VSV and then fused with uninfected cells. Transfer of the VSV G protein from Golgi membranes in the infected to the uninfected cells was monitored by a glycosylation event that could be carried out by only the uninfected recipient, which was chosen to complement the glycosylation defect of the infected cell. These observations indicated that efficient transfer of VSV G protein occurs between spatially distinct Golgi stacks. This is most easily explained byamechanism involving VSVG proteincontaining transport vesicles that form from the infected cell Golgi, diffuse through the heterokaryon's cytosol, and fuse with Golgi membranes in the uninfected cell. Conceivably, the same transport vesicles could mediate intercisternal transport within a single Golgi stack.",

In their approach, Golgi fractions prepared from VSV-infected GlcNAc transferase-deficient 158 cells (\"donor Golgi\") are incubated with similar fractions from uninfected wild-type cells ('acceptor Golgi\"). Upon the addition of ATP and cytosolderived factors, there is a progressive appearance of [3H]GlcNAc-labeled (Balch et al., 1984) and endo H-resistant (Fries and Rothman, 1981) VSV G protein, reflecting its transfer from mutant \"donor\" to wild-type \"acceptor\" membranes.",

The vesicles have been isolated (after elution from l:heir membrane-bound state by high salt), and their coats have been found to contain several unique components . One of these, B-COP, was previously identified by Kreis and coworkers as a 110 kd peripheral protein tightly associated with the Golgi (Allan and IKreis, 1986; Duden et al., 1991b; Serafini et al., 1991) . These non-clathrin-coated vesicles are good candidates ,for carrier vesicles. First, they contain VSV G protein, the iprotein being transported (Orci et al., 1986 Serafini let al., 1991) . Next, conditions that block the transport reac-tion in general result in the accumulation or lack of formation of vesicles. Most interestingly, treatment of cells or isolated membranes with the nonhydrolyzable GTP analog, GTPyS, both blocks glycosylation of the VSV G protein and results in the accumulation of VSV G protein-containing coated buds and vesicles . Similar results were obtained using AIF4, an inhibitor of conventional GTP-binding \"G proteins\" Kahn, 1991) . The stage at which these inhibitors act remains unknown (Donaldson et al., 1991 b) .",

For example, it will be important to confirm that the Golgi vesicles do not contain resident proteins, e.g., glycosyltransferases, that are not intended for transport. The analogous point is well established for plasma membrane clathrin-coated vesicles. Many examples are known where proteins destined for coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis accumulate at coated pits, while those that are not efficiently internalized do not enter coated pits (Pearse and Robinson, 1990) .",

In this work, the effect of BFA on the Golgi transport assay was determined. BFA is a macrocyclic fungal antibiotic that blocks the transport of membrane and secretory proteins through the Golgi (Takatsuki and Tamura, 1985; Misumi et al., 1986) . In intact cells, the drug causes a dramatic and rapid retrograde transport of Golgi components back to the ER via a system of tubular extensions (Lippincott- Schwartz et al., 1990) . The mechanism of BFA action is unknown, but one intriguing property is its ability to rapidly, and reversibly, trigger the dissociation of B-COP (Donaldson et al., 1991a; Klausner et al., 1992) .",

It is at present impossible to distinguish between these two possibilities.

One wellstudied example is the early endosome, the structure of which varies in different cell types (Marsh et al., 1986; Tooze et al., 1991) . Cell-free assays have documented that the early endosome elements can fuse avidly with each other (Gruenberg and Howell, 1989) .

Indeed, even in untreated Golgi, both in vitro and in intact cells, tubules can be found that are similar to those observed in BFA-treated Golgi (Hermo et al., 1980; Braell et al., 1984 [see Figure 8b in this reference]; Griffiths et al., 1985) . That a direct fusion event is possible is also suggested by the fact that the predicted diffusion coefficient of intact Golgi stacks is ~1 O-fold less than that of the much smaller coated vesicles (N. Ktistakis, unpublished data). Thus, one might expect a decrease in the kinetics of VSV G protein transfer if BFA were to switch the signal generated in vitro from a vesicle-dependent phenomenon (as is presumed to occur in the absence of the drug) to a direct, tubule-mediated fusion event. However, G protein is transported from donor to acceptor with the same kinetics in the presence or absence of BFA . Finally, the fact that the two N-linked chains of VSV G protein are processed simultaneously in vitro as opposed to sequentially in permeabilized cells may also indicate that compartmental boundaries may not be strictly preserved, i.e., that direct fusion may occur, during the cell-free assay (Schwaninger et al., 1991) .",

The tubular interconnections known to occur in the Golgi may also play a role in intercompartmental transfer, but we view these as probably being more important for establishing and maintaining intracompartmental links that serve to interconnect functionally identical Golgi compartments and to mix their contents. These tubular connections may break and fuse continuously, accounting for the dynamic behavior of the Golgi complex after microtubule disassembly and reassembly. However, if their formation is tightly controlled by a regulated process of assembly and disassembly of the f&COP-containing Golgi coat, even tubule-based intercompartmental transfer is not inconceivable. Moreover, whether cell-free assays of Golgi function reflect such an intercompartmental transfer, or intracompartmental transfer between wild-type and mutant Golgi, remains to be solved. Only further characterization of the machinery responsible for intra-Golgi transport will decide between these two possibilities. Nevertheless, based on the evidence both from the in vitro assays and from yeast genetics, it is clear that the few proteins identified thus far, such as NSF and SNAP, are generally important elements, irrespective of the precise pathways or whether transport occurs via vesicles or tubules.",

            "text": "Is Transport through the Golgi Selective or Nonselective? Having considered the evidence for the compartmental organization of the Golgi and for the role of carrier vesicles in transport, we come to the last of the three general elements underlying our view of Golgi function, namely, that transport of passenger proteins through the Golgi is inherently nonselective (Pfeffer and Rothman, 1987) . The evidence for this view is largely indirect or negative, in that efforts to identify discrete signals on proteins that are required for forward transport have thus far been unsuccessful. On the other hand, as discussed above, there is now considerable evidence in favor of several distinct \"retenlion signals\" that effectively prevent forward transport of membrane or lumenal proteins after reaching their prescribed destinations in the ER or various Golgi compartments (Pelham, 1991) . If this view is correct, selectivity in I.ransport through the secretory pathway may occur by \"default,\" i.e., transport of passenger proteins proceeds owing to the absence of a retention signal. This concept, however, is not necessarily incompatible with the existence of selective signals for forward transport. It is clear that such signals exist and play an important role in directing the traffic of proteins as they leave the TGN. Examples include the mannose g-phosphate residues that specify transport of hydrolytic enzymes to lysosomes and Mellman, 1989) and the cytoplasmic domain determiinants that target newly synthesized membrane proteins to ithe basolateral surface of polarized cells (Hunziker et al., 1991a; Brewer and Roth, 1991) . Since the transport of ,fluorescent lipids from the Golgi to the plasma membrane Iin nonpolarized cells occurs very rapidly, it is thought that \"constitutive\" transport from the Golgi to the cell surface may not require specific signals . ,Analogous results were obtained in experiments in which a tripeptide containing a cognate site for N-linked glycosylation presumably also involved transport from the ER (Wieland et al., 1987; Helms et al., 1990) . While these experiments suggest that signals are not necessary for transport, the fact that they are released with rapid kinetics does not alone establish the absence of such signals.",

We have now entered an exciting period of research, during which it will become possible to define the molecular mechanisms responsible for generating and maintaining Golgi structure and function. The first phase is already well under way and has been characterized by a search for essential bits and pieces of the Golgi machinery, a number of which have already been found (NSFlsecl8, aSNAPlsecl7, (J-COP, ARF[Stearnsetal., 19901, rab6p[Goudetal., 1990] ,sec7p [Achstetter et al., 19881, and secl4p [Bankaitis et al., 199Oj) . As we have seen, however, it is at present difficult to know precisely what steps are controlled by each of these components. Nevertheless, the observed conservation of Golgi proteins between S. cerevisiae and mammals is most encouraging for our ability to confirm in living cells the function of components identified in vitro. The combination of cell-free analysis and genetics has proven its worth. The next phase will have to deal with the questions that have arisen. How many Golgi compartments are there? Are compartment boundaries defined by specific protein frameworks? If so, how do they function and how are they regulated? Does transport between Golgi compartments require vesicular carriers? What is the role of tubules? How does the machinery responsible for forward traffic relate to the machinery controlling homotypic fusion? How is specificity of forward and backward traffic regulated? How does lipid composition and organization affect transport? What function does the stack structure have? How do microtubules interact with the Golgi elements? The challenge will be to integrate the information we are now collecting in the context of how the Golgi complex works as a whole.",
