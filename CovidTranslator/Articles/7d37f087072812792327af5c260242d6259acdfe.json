Epidemics also result in human and economic losses, especially in agriculture, public health and tourism. Therefore, research about people's understandings of influenza is critical to the health and productivity of livestock. As the course of influenza outbreaks depends on a large extent on high-risk groups involved in animal production such as pig and poultry farmers-key stakeholders in the emergence, transmission, prevention and containment of zoonotic diseases-it is paramount to investigate their beliefs and practices (Dhand et al. 2011; Gray and Kayali 2009; Kuo et al. 2011) .",

For instance, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a viral disease first reported in South China in 2002, most likely originated in human-animal transmission in animal markets in Guangdong Province; the Chinese government was criticised for its handling of the crisis (Smith 2006) . The initial outbreak of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in China occurred in 2013, and cases continue to be reported especially by people exposed to live poultry. Another concern is swine flu (H1N1), first found in China in May 2009, responsible for a flu pandemic in -2010 . Recently, Yang et al. (2016 warned that immediate action is needed to prevent an outbreak of a new strain (EAH1N1) which transmits efficiently in humans and may pose the highest pandemic threat among animal influenza viruses.",

            "text": "Research in China about public perceptions of animal influenza reveals mixed findings. Goodwin and Sun's (2013) investigation of public reactions to H7N9 showed some understanding of the virus and compliance with recommended behaviour changes; however, the Chinese public reported moderate anxiety and potential discrimination against some social groups, which could lead to social disruption and a high burden on resources. In another study, Goodwin and Sun (2014) identified a moderate level of anxiety about personal and family infection which predicted recommended and non-recommended behavioural changes to abate an influenza threat, and respondents represented their trust in the Chinese government's advice about H7N9. Moreover, poultry workers in farmers' markets appeared to have low awareness and concern about animal influenza and low rates of protective measures (Chen et al. 2015) . However, research hitherto about public perceptions has focused on the Han, the main ethnic group in China comprising over 90% of the population, and paucity exists regarding ethnic minorities. Therefore, the present study investigates the awareness and experiences of animal influenza among Dai Lue smallholder farmers, an ethnic minority and farming community in Yunnan Province, Southwest China (Zhao and Davey 2015) . The majority of Dai are agriculturists, believe in Theravada Buddhism and speak Dai languages, a different cultural heritage to the Han majority which suggests they might also have distinct local understandings of animal influenza and its causes, symptoms, prevention and treatment, which need to be explored to ensure culturally congruent animal health, production and welfare strategies.",

This was relevant to the study because it revealed insights about the farmers' understandings of animal welfare, especially confinement, which is also applicable to their treatment and production of livestock. All of the dogs encountered by the interviewers were tethered with limited room for movement (similar to the pigs which were confined in small cramped backyard pigsties). The dogs were regarded as guard dogs rather than pets as there was an absence of pet-keeping among the farmers who emphasised the commoditisation of animals. Discussions revealed the dogs had been tethered for hours, days, months and years, although some farmers took them for daily walks. Reasons given by the participants for dog-tethering included concerns about protection of property, as guard dogs barked when approached by people; the dogs would run away from home or be stolen or eaten by others; and they could bite or injure people. The participants did not report any appreciable knowledge of the welfare needs of their dogs such as companionship and interaction with people, and they did not know the dogs could suffer physical and psychological harm being permanently tied with limited room for movement. Only two participants thought dogs and farm animals would not be happy when confined. These findings revealed a minimal understanding of the physical and welfare needs of animals with implications for the treatment and production of livestock, discussed in the next section.",

Specifically, they were largely unaware of animal influenza and strains of viruses such as H7N9 and H1N1, including their causes, symptoms, prevention and treatment. Indeed, the farmers seemed to be generally care-free and ignorant about animal influenza and human infection and unknowingly engaged in behaviours which increased direct or indirect exposure to infected live or dead animals-the primary risk factor for transmission. Reports by some participants of local incidents of avian influenza, which apparently killed large numbers of poultry, require further investigation to ensure surveillance and containment of infectious diseases of public health importance. The findings also signified poor usage of veterinary services and limited awareness of animal husbandry and welfare. Despite close proximity to government-run veterinary services, contact with veterinary staff was insufficient, and proactive services that cater for the specific needs of the small-scale farmers are needed (Forbes and Kepe 2015) .",

That the study identified gaps in the farmers' knowledge justifies veterinary health education activities to provide factual information about animal influenza, especially to encourage action for its prevention and containment on farms. The paucity of knowledge about influenza among the farmers may suggest deficiencies in the Chinese government's nationwide awareness campaigns which might not be reaching ethnic minority groups or issues understanding the health information people receive. However, there were demographic differences as older participants were less knowledgeable of animal influenza and were less likely to take action when their animals showed signs of disease. This is most likely because they were less educated than younger people and fluent only in Dai Lue language, whereas younger people have attended school, understand Mandarin (the official language of China) and have a higher exposure to media. Older participants also reported temporal comparisons, such as changes in farming conditions in recent decades, and were more experienced and knowledgeable of folk medicine for animals as it was popular in times past.",

(2015) which observed low awareness and lack of concern of avian influenza and human infection as well as low rates of protective measures. Similarly, Lau et al. (2009) found widespread public misconceptions about animal influenza in a Chinese city. However, other studies suggest some segments of the Chinese public have a better understanding of influenza as well as greater compliance with government advice and recommended behaviour changes Sun 2013, 2014) . Sampling most likely accounts for this difference as the majority of previous studies sampled urban and Han participants, whereas the present sample had rural and low education and socio-economic backgrounds. This should be taken into account when interpreting the findings, which is consistent with earlier work which illustrated differential threat perceptions among urban and rural residents (Liao et al. 2009 ). Therefore, sampling farmers or the general public with higher education and socio-economic levels might reveal greater awareness of animal influenza and its prevention and control. The low socio-economic background of the farmers in the present study is also important because the poorest segments of the population are more at risk of contracting zoonotic diseases and carry the heaviest burden, which creates obstacles for socio-economic development (Gilbert 2012; Liu et al. 2014; World Health Organization 2006) .",
