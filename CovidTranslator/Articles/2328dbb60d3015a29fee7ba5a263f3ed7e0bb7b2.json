Limiting the duration of studies to decrease the variability due to ageassociated changes will also refine long-term studies. Other considerations for refinement of carcinogenesis studies include selection of the most sensitive sex of one or more species for evaluation of selected chemicals in a class where toxic and carcinogenic potential of other representative chemicals are known.

Light may cause eye lesions and influence tumor incidences (Greenman et al., 1984; Wiskemann et al., 1986) . High light intensity may cause eye lesions in albino rodents, (Bellhorn, 1980; Greenman et al., 1982) . In some NTP studies, for example, Fischer 344 rats housed in the top row and side columns of racks where they were exposed to more light than the rats in other cages have been observed to develop opacity of the eyes and this appears to be due to inflammation of various structures of the eye. This lesion later progressed to generalized inflammation of the eye with retinal degeneration and cataract formation. Prevalence of eye lesions by cage position and light intensity in male F344 rats is illustrated by an example shown in Table 3 . If the chemical under investigation has the potential to cause eye lesions, then the light intensity related eye lesions may complicate the interpretation of chemical effects. As shown in Table 4 (NTP, 1989) high doses of the chemical appear to have increased the incidence of eye lesions in male F344 rats. However, the contribution of light intensity for development of eye lesions in the treated groups is not known. The prevalence of light intensity-associated eye lesions in rodents could be markedly decreased by (a) reducing the light intensity in the cages to < 15 foot-candles or the animal room light intensity to ~50 foot-candles at 5 ft from the Rao, 1986. floor and (b) rotating the cages of each column of a rack from top to bottom when cages or racks are changed (NTP, unpublished data).",

Optimal diets for rodents in long-term toxicity and carcinogenesis studies should be nutritionally adequate for growth and maintenance without excesses of high energy and growth enhancing nutrients. There should be established formulation with standards for ingredients, nutrient concentra-tions, and contaminant limits. Contaminant concentrations should be as low as practical. Each batch/lot of diet should be analyzed for macronutrients and selected micronutrients with complete micronutrient analyses on selected batches/lots (Rao, 1988a) . Viral infections. Sendai virus (SV), pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are the most common viral infections of mice and SV, PVM, and rat corona virus/sialodacryoadenitis virus (RCV/SDAV) infections are most common in rats (Boorman et al., 1986) . Viral infections may complicate toxicology research (Collins, 1986) . In a systematic comparison of control and chemically treated groups of B6C3Fl mice, viral infections did not cause consistent adverse effects on survival and tumor prevalences. However, SV infection in mice was associated with significantly (r, < 0.05) higher survival and survival-associated increase in liver tumors (Rao et al.. 1989a ). Viral infections did not cause consistent adverse effects on survival or tumor prevalences in control groups of F344 rats (Rao et al., 1989b) . However, viral infections were associated with nonneoplastic lesions in lungs, nasal cavity, liver, and other organs of rats and mice and may complicate the identification and interpretation of toxic effects of chemicals (NTP, unpublished data).",

There should be specific criteria supplemented with professional judgment for euthanasia of moribund animals during the course of these long-term studies. The objective of these criteria is not only to relieve excessive pain and distress to animals but also to allow collection of tissues for pathologic assessment that are free of secondary complications. Major reasons for eu- thanasia of animals during the course of a large mammary tumor may be injured during study include: (a) large masses and other conthe normal movement in the cage leading to ditions interfering with eating and drinking, ulceration and infection resulting in second-(b) major injuries and ulcers related to husary lesions in the tumor and in the animal. bandry, fighting, or chemical exposure, and Major injuries such as accidental fracture of (c) diseases and conditions indicating pain a limb or wounds resulting from fighting of and suffering as judged by an experienced group-caged animals may lead to unrelieved laboratory animal specialist. For example, a pain and nonhealing lesions. For humane reasons and to prevent complications of chemical-induced lesions by secondary changes, it is prudent to euthanatize and necropsy the animal. In studies such as dermal toxicity and carcinogenesis where treatment causes persistent or enlarging ulcers and fast growing tumors which are injured by the animal or components of the cage, it is appropriate to euthanatize and necropsy the animal not only to relieve pain and distress but also to prevent infections. Infections and inflammation may lead to secondary lesions which can complicate the interpretation of toxic effects and may decrease the sensitivity of a toxicology study. Other considerations for euthanasia of rodents in chronic studies are listed in Table 5 ; most of these conditions will change the normal physiology and may affect morbidity and mortality. Any one of these conditions may not lead to mortality in a short period, but a combination of these conditions will compromise the physiology and health of the animals. If these animals are allowed to continue in a study, secondary affects may mask or exacerbate the chemical effects, complicate the interpretation of toxic effects, and decrease the sensitivity and quality of a long-term study.",

            "text": "Duration of toxicology studies with rodents may range from 3 to 18 months depending on the toxicity of the chemical (Frederick, 1986 ). In general a 3-to 6-month toxicity study may be long enough for many chemicals with considerable acute toxic effects and limited cumulative toxicity. However, with a high proportion of chemicals, due to the cumulative nature of their toxicity, 3 to 6 months duration may not be long enough and studies of 9 to 12 months duration may be necessary. Chemicals that can cause delayed toxicity, such as neurotoxicity, may have to be evaluated in studies of 12 to 18 months duration. However, when con- ducting studies longer than 12 months, one should be aware of and consider the influence of age-associated changes and complications in interpretation of the toxic responses. Duration of chemical carcinogenesis studies in rodents usually covers a major portion of the life span. Length of generally accepted chemical carcinogenesis studies in rats and mice include: (a) 21 to 24 months, (b) 30 months or 20% survival, whichever occurs first, and (c) until most or all animals in the chemically exposed groups die or are euthanatized due to moribund condition. For potent or \"early\" carcinogens, studies longer than 18 months may not be necessary (e.g., 1,3-butadiene, Huff et al., 1985) . For weaker carcinogens with delayed expression of carcinogenic potential, studies of longer than 21 months may be necessary. The median life span (50% survival) of rodent species and strains used for chemical carcinogenesis studies is 20 to 30 months and, therefore, studies lasting 2 1 to 27 months will cover 60-80% of the life span, assuming 90% mortality is close to the life span. In these long-term studies, especially in studies longer than 18 to 2 1 months, there are several age-associated changes that may compromise the health of the animals and complicate the expression and interpretation of carcinogenic response. Tables 6 and 7 and Figs. 1 to 3 illustrate some of the age-associated changes that may complicate long-term carcinogenesis studies.",

The decline in body weight is accompanied by an increase in water consumption or vice versa (Fig. I) . The increase in water consumption (polydipsia) is due to nephrosis leading to polyuria with substantial changes in physiologic processes such as distribution, metabolism, and excretion of chemicals (Grice, 1984) . These changes could complicate the interpretation of a toxicology study.

Changes in organ function are associated with changes in metabolism and toxic responses to chemicals.

Retrospective analyses of sex-species combinations for identifying potential chemical carcinogens are shown in Table 8 . Combinations of male rats and male mice or male rats and female mice detected 124 (92%) of the 135 identified carcinogens.

Prospective predictions based on these retrospective evaluations may not be appropriate for unknown chemicals. When a class of chemicals is evaluated (e.g., benzidine dyes, nitrotoluenes, glycol ethers), both sexes of rats and mice may have to be included to assess full carcinogenic potential and mechanism of carcinogenesis of a few representative chemicals of the class.
