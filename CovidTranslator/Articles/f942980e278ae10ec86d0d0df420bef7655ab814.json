Requirements of medical conduct were spelled out as part of the general legal code of Hammurabi in Mesopotamia (c. 1700 BCE). This code included regulation of physician fees, with punishment for treatment failure, which set a legal basis for the subsequent secular practice of medicine. Many of the main traditions of medicine were based on magic or derived from religion. Medical practice was often based on belief in the supernatural, and healers were believed to have a religious calling. Training of medical practitioners, regulation of their practice, and ethical standards evolved in a number of ancient societies. In general, physicians were regulated by specific schools that acted as trade guilds, often with many competing schools based on differing gods, methods, and mystical beliefs.",

Indian medicine originated in herbalism associated with gods. Between 800 and 200 BCE, Ayurvedic medicine developed, and with it, medical schools and \"public hospitals\". The ancient Indian way of medical practice, Ayurveda, is the Sanskrit translation of \"knowledge of life\". Primarily originating in the Indus Valley, the golden age of ancient Indian medicine began approximately 800 BCE. Personal hygiene, sanitation, and water supply engineering were emphasized in the laws of Manu. Pioneering physicians, supported by Buddhist kings, developed the use of drugs and surgery, and established schools of medicine and public hospitals as part of state medicine. Indian medicine played a leading role throughout Asia between 800 BCE and 400 CE, when major texts on medicine and surgery were written. Among the most valued pieces of ancient Indian writings are those created by Sushruta, a surgeon, and Charaka, a physician, both prominent teachers who ran prestigious schools of medicine. These writings contribute to validating ancient India's medical history. According to some historians, the teachings of Sushruta and Charaka were passed along to the Romans and Greeks. Despite these advanced medical teachings, with the Mogul invasion of 600 CE, state support declined, and with it, Indian medicine.",

Ancient Egyptian intensive agriculture and irrigation practices were associated with widespread parasitic disease. The cities had stone masonry gutters for drainage, and personal hygiene was highly emphasized. Egyptian medicine developed surgical skills and organization of medical care, including specialization and training that greatly influenced the development of Greek medicine. The Ebers Papyrus, written 3400 years ago, gives an extensive description of Egyptian medical science, including the isolation of infected surgical patients. It is recognized as the most extensive and significant of all the known papyri, given the physiological knowledge uncovered. While the first section of the Ebers Papyrus revolves around divine origin and the strength of magic, the latter portions discuss the treatment of medical conditions including digestive diseases, eye diseases, and skin problems. Fractures and painful limbs are also described. The papyrus includes a treatise on the heart and vessels, standing out as only one of many covering anatomy and physiology.

It also laid a basis for medical and public health jurisprudence. Personal and community responsibility for health included a mandatory day of rest, limits on slavery and guarantees of the rights of slaves and workers, protection of water supplies, sanitation of communities and camps, waste disposal, and food protection, all codified in detailed religious obligations. Food regulation prevented use of diseased or unclean animals, and prescribed methods of slaughter improved the possibility of preservation of the meat. While there was an element of viewing illness as a punishment for sin, there was also an ethical and social stress on the value of human life with an obligation to seek and provide care. The Talmudic interpretation of biblical law is the concept of sanctity of human life (Pikuah Nefesh); the saving of a single human life was considered \"as if one saved the whole world\", which has been given overriding religious and social roles in community life. A second principle from this source is improving the quality of life on Earth (Tikkun Olam). In this tradition, there is an ethical imperative to achieve a better earthly life for all. The Mosaic Law, which forms the basis for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, codified health behaviors for the individual and for society. These found secular versions in Humanism over recent centuries, which have continued into the modern era as basic concepts in societal values and in practical application in environmental and social hygiene.",

Hippocrates articulated the clinical methods of observation and documentation and a code of ethics of medical practice. He articulated the relationship between disease patterns and the natural environment (air, water, and places), which dominated epidemiological thinking until the nineteenth century. Preservation of health was seen as a balance of forces: exercise and rest, nutrition and excretion, and recognizing the importance of age and sex variables in health needs. Disease was seen as having inevitable natural causation, and medical care was valued, with the city-states providing free medical services for the poor and for slaves. City officials were appointed to look after public drains and water supply, providing organized sanitary and public health services. Hippocrates gave medicine a rudimentary, scientific, and ethical spirit which lasts to the present time.",

Roman law also regulated businesses and medical practice. The influence of the Roman Empire resulted in the transfer of these ideas throughout much of Europe and the Middle East. Rome itself had access to clean water via 10 aqueducts supplying ample water for the citizens. Rome also built public drains. By the early first century BCE, the aqueducts made available 600-900 liters per person per day of household water from mountains. Marshlands were drained to reduce endemic malaria.

Training as apprentices, Roman physicians achieved a highly respected role in society. Hospitals and municipal doctors were employed by Roman cities to provide free care to the poor and the slaves, but physicians also engaged in private practice, mostly on retainers to families. Occupational health was described with measures to reduce known risks such as lead exposure, particularly in mining. Commercial weights and measures were standardized and supervised. Rome made important contributions to the public health tradition of sanitation, urban planning, and organized medical care. Galen, Rome's leading physician, perpetuated the fame of Hippocrates through his medical writings, basing medical assessment on the four humors (sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and melancholic).

In Western Europe, public and religious ceremonies and burials were promoted by religious and civil authorities, which increased contact with infected people. The misconception that cats were the cause of plague led to their slaughter; however, they could have helped to stem the tide of disease brought by rats and their fleas to humans. Hygienic practices limited the spread of plague in Jewish ghettos, leading to the Jews being blamed for the plague's spread, and widespread massacres, especially in Germany and Central Europe. Seaport cities in the fourteenth century began to apply the biblical injunction to separate lepers by keeping ships coming from places with the plague waiting in remote parts of the harbor, initially for 30 days (treutina), then for 40 days (quarantina) (Ragusa in 1465, and Venice in 1485), establishing the public health act of quarantine as a government measure, which on a pragmatic basis was found to reduce the chance of entry of the plague. Towns along major overland trading routes in Russia took measures to restrict movement in homes, streets, and entire towns during epidemics. In sixteenth-century Russia, Novgorod banned public funerals during plague epidemics, and in the seventeenth century, Czar Boris Godunov banned trade, prohibited religious and other ceremonies, and instituted quarantine-type measures. All over Europe, municipal efforts to enforce isolation broke down as crowds gathered and were uncontrolled by inadequate police forces and public health. In 1630, all officers of the Board of Health of Florence, Italy, were excommunicated because of efforts to prevent spread of the contagion by isolation of cases, thereby interfering with religious ceremonies to assuage God's wrath through appeals to divine providence.",

Medical-social reform involving hospitals, prisons, and lazarettos (leprosy hospitals) in Britain, led by John Howard (On the State of Prisons, published in 1777), produced substantive improvements in these institutions. Following the French Revolution, Philippe Pinel (1745-1826) was instrumental in the development of a more humane psychological approach to the custody and care of psychiatric patients.

These occupational risks included exposure to chemicals, dust, and metals, as well as musculoskeletal injury from unnatural postures and repetitive or violent motions. In his publication, he described other various disease-causative agents encountered by workers in 52 major occupations. Considered to be the \"father of occupational medicine\", Ramazzini established the basis for this field, although progress in the application of his views was slow. Despite the reluctance to apply his beliefs, the latter part of the century fostered interest in the health of sailors and soldiers, which led to important developments in military and naval medicine. Studies of prevalent diseases were carried out by pioneering physicians among workers in various trades, such as metalworkers, bakers, shoemakers, and hatmakers. Deeper understanding of these trades and the risks involved allowed for the identification of causative agents, and thus methods of prevention. The observational studies of Percivall Pott (1714-1789) identified scrotal cancer as an occupational hazard of chimney sweeps (1775). In 1767, George Baker (1722-1809) studied Devonshire colic, acquired from lead poisoning in cider production. Each of these and other similar studies helped to lay the basis for the development of investigative epidemiology.",

London City Corporation had nearly 100 paving, lighting, and cleansing boards, 172 welfare boards, and numerous other health-related authorities in 1830.

Labor law reforms (the Mines and the Factory Acts) banned children and women from underground work in the mines and regulated reduction in the workday to 10 hours. These reforms were adopted by the British Parliament in the 1830s to 1840s. The spread of railroads and steamships, the Penny Post (1840), and telegraphs (1846), combined with growing literacy and compulsory primary education introduced in Britain in 1876, dramatically altered local and world communication.",

John Snow, a founding member of the London Epidemiological Society and anesthetist to Queen Victoria, investigated an outbreak of cholera in Soho from August to September 1854, in the area adjacent to Broad Street. He traced some 500 cholera deaths occurring in a 10-day period. Cases either lived close to or used the Broad Street pump for drinking water.

He investigated an outbreak in 1853 in Cowbridge, a small Welsh village, where a ball attracted 140 participants from surrounding counties. Almost immediately afterwards, many of those attending the ball became sick with typhoid fever. He found that a person with typhoid had been at the location some days before, and that his excreta had been disposed of near a well, from which water was drawn for the ball. Budd then concluded that water was the vehicle of transmission of the disease. He investigated other outbreaks and summarized his reports in Typhoid Fever: Its Nature, Mode of Transmission and Prevention, published in 1873, which is a classic work on waterborne transmission of enteric disease.

The invention of this apparatus is considered to be a groundbreaking discovery, a watershed in the history of science. His research showing small microorganisms led to his recognition as a Fellow of the Royal Society of England in 1680. The germ theorists believed that microbes, such as those described by van Leeuwenhoek, were the cause of diseases which could be transmitted from person to person or by contact with sewage or contaminated water. Major contributions to resolving this issue came from the epidemiological studies of Snow and Budd in the 1850s, proving waterborne transmission of cholera and typhoid, suggesting that if the disease was not from a miasma source then it was due to germ (contagion) sources. The classic study of a measles epidemic in the remote Faroe Islands by Peter Panum in 1846 clearly showed person-to-person transmission of this disease, its incubation period, and the lifelong natural immunity that exposure gives (Box 1.6) .

Parasitic diseases of animals and humans, including Guinea worm disease, tapeworms, filariasis, and veterinary parasitic diseases such as Texas cattle fever, were investigated in many centers during the nineteenth century. David Bruce (1855-1931) demonstrated transmission of nagana (animal African trypanosomiasis), a disease of cattle and horses in Zululand, South Africa, in 1894-1895. Nagana is caused by a trypanosome parasite transmitted by the tsetse fly, and its study led to the use of environmental methods of control to halt disease transmission. Alexandre Yersin and Shibasaburo Kitasato (1853-1931) discovered the plague bacillus in 1894, and in 1898 French epidemiologist P. L. Simmond demonstrated that the plague was a disease of rats spread by fleas to humans.",

Laveran persisted, and after ending his military career he continued his research, producing irrefutable evidence that was later validated by other experts.

An outbreak in Philadelphia in 1798 killed nearly 8 percent of the population. Outbreaks in New York killed 732 people in 1795, 2086 in 1798, and 606 in 1803.

A remarkable figure, he was the first microbiologist to develop and use vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague, after testing them on himself. Other pioneering achievements include those of Richard Pfeiffer (1858-1945) , a bacteriologist studying under Robert Koch and Sir Almoth Wright (1861-1947) , known for his work in co-developing the typhoid vaccine. Albert Calmette , a bacteriologist, and Camille Gu\u00e9rin (1872-1961) a veterinarian, worked together, examining the intestinal route of TB. Through persistence and the constant replanting of bacterial cultures, the two developed the TB vaccine, called BCG (bacille Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin), named after the remarkable pair of researchers. Further contributory achievements include those of Theobald Smith (1859-1934) , a pathologist most recognized for his research in Texas cattle fever, and Max Theiler (1899 -1972 , Nobel Prize 1951 , a prominent South African physician successful in discovering the vaccine against yellow fever.",

The Henry Street Mission, serving poor immigrant areas, developed the model of visiting nurses and public milk stations. The concept of the \"milk station\", combined with home visits, was pioneered by Lillian Wald (1867-1940) , who coined the term district nurse or public health nurse. This became the basis for public prenatal, postnatal, and well-child care, as well as school health supervision. Visiting Nursing Associations (VNAs) gradually developed throughout the USA to provide such services. Physicians' services in the USA were mainly provided on a fee-for-service basis for those able to pay, with charitable services in large city hospitals. The concept of direct provision of care to those in need by local authorities and by voluntary charitable associations, with separation between preventive and curative services, is still a model of health care in many countries. Maternal mortality at the beginning of the twentieth century was at levels current in developing countries today. Since the 1920s, the maternal mortality rates drastically declined in the USA owing to improved access to professional prenatal care and delivery (Figure 1.1) .",

Goldberger's work established the dietary causes of pellagra, and in 1928 he discovered the pellagra-preventing factor in yeast (Box 1.13). In 1916, US investigators defined fat-soluble vitamin A and watersoluble vitamin B; the latter was later shown to be more than one factor. In 1922 , Elmer McCollum (1879 -1967 identified vitamin D in cod liver oil, which became a staple in child care for many decades. Rickets, still common in 1900 1910 1920 1930 1940 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 industrialized countries prior to World War II and into the 1950s, virtually disappeared following fortification of milk with vitamin D. In the period 1931-1937, fluoride in drinking water was found to prevent tooth decay, in 1932 vitamin C was isolated from lemon juice. Iodization of salt to prevent iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) has been one of the greatest successes, and failures, of twentieth-century public health. From studies in Zurich and in the USA, the efficacy of iodine supplements in preventing goiter was demonstrated. In 1924 Morton's iodized salt became a national standard in the USA; it served as an early and noble example of voluntary public health action by private industry. In 1941, the USA initiated mandatory fortification of \"iodine-enriched\" salt, as well as flour (iron, vitamins B and later folic acid) and milk (with vitamin D). In Canada, iodized salt became mandatory in 1979 along with other vitamin and mineral fortification of bread and milk (see Chapter 8). Prevention of IDD \"Mal de la rosa\", first described in Spain by Casal in 1735, was common in northern Italy. In 1771, Frappolli described \"pelle agra\" or farmers' skin, often mistaken for leprosy. Pellagra was a common disorder among poor farm families whose diet consisted mainly of corn flour. Pellagra is characterized by the \"4 Ds\": diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death. In 1818, Hameau described a widespread skin disease among poor farmers in southern France. Theophile Roussel (1816 Roussel ( -1903 investigated and concluded that pellagra was endemic and due to poverty rather than a diet heavy in corn. The French Department of Agriculture implemented his recommended reforms, raising standards of living among poor farmers by encouraging them to grow wheat and potatoes instead of corn. Consequently, the disease disappeared by the beginning of the twentieth century. Similar measures in Italy reduced the growth of corn, and here too the disease disappeared. Lambrozo, in Verona, Italy, reported many cases of pellagra among mental hospital patients, also concluding that it was due to toxic material in corn. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the corn theory was less accepted and the common view was that pellagra was an infectious disease. British investigator L. V. Sambon, discoverer of the role of the tsetse fly in trypanosomiasis in 1910, took the view that the disease was mosquito borne.",

Between 1907 and 1940, approximately three million Americans contracted pellagra and 100,000 of them died. In 1913 , Joseph Goldberger (1874 -1929 of the US Public Health Service was appointed by the Surgeon General to investigate the pellagra epidemic in the southern USA. Goldberger had previously worked on yellow fever, dengue, and typhus. He visited psychiatric hospitals and orphanages with endemic pellagra and was struck by the observation that the staff was not affected, suggesting that the disease was not infectious. He recognized that non-transmission from patients to staff suggested a noninfectious cause. He postulated that it may have been due to the diet. In one mental hospital, he eliminated pellagra by adding milk and eggs to the diet and concluded that the disease was due to a lack of vitamins and preventable by a change in diet alone. He went on to establish the nutritional basis of this disease: a landmark in nutritional epidemiology in public health.",

Pellagra, a classic dietary deficiency disease caused by insufficient niacin, was noted in the South after the Civil War. Then considered infectious, it was known as the disease of the four Ds: diarrhea, dermatitis, dementia, and death. The first outbreak was reported in 1907. In 1909, more than 1000 cases were estimated based on reports from 13 states. One year later, approximately 3000 cases were suspected nationwide based on estimates from 30 states and the District of Columbia. By the end of 1911, pellagra had been reported in all but nine states, and prevalence estimates had increased nearly ninefold. During 1906 During -1940 , approximately 3 million cases and approximately 100,000 deaths were attributed to pellagra. From 1914 until his death in 1929 groundbreaking studies that demonstrated that pellagra was not infectious but was associated with poverty and poor diet. Despite compelling evidence, his hypothesis remained controversial and unconfirmed until 1937. The near elimination of pellagra by the end of the 1940s has been attributed to improved diet and health associated with economic recovery during the 1940s and to the enrichment of flour with niacin. Today, most physicians in the United States have never seen pellagra although outbreaks continue to occur, particularly among refugees and during emergencies in developing countries.",

The idea of sickness as punishment for sin prevented attempts to control disease over many centuries. This mentality persists in modern times through \"blaming the victim\". AIDS patients are seen as deserving their fate because of their behavior; workers are believed to become injured because of their own negligence; and the obese person and the smoker are believed to deserve their illnesses because of weakness in the way they conduct their lives. The sanctity of human life, improving the world, and human rights are fundamental to the ethics and values of public health, as is charity in care, in which there is a societal and professional responsibility for kindness and relief of suffering. Ethical controversies pitting individual rights versus community benefit are still ongoing in many diverse areas such as universal health insurance, food fortification, fluoridation of water supplies, managed care, reproductive health, cost-benefit analysis, euthanasia, the care of sex workers and prisoners, and many others.",

This concept also articulates the primary importance of prevention and primary care, which became a vital issue in competition for resources between public health and hospital-oriented health care.",

The health and well-being of the individual and the community are interdependent.

The progress made up to 2013 has been substantial in many regions, with reduction in rates of extreme poverty, enrolling children into primary schools, addressing AIDS, malaria and child health, and a good likelihood of reaching the target for access to clean drinking water. Despite this progress, progress in sub-Saharan Africa has been very slow, with no advances at all in addressing maternal mortality rates.",

Organized activity to prevent disease and promote health had to be relearned from the ancient and postindustrial revolution worlds. Over the coming decades of the twenty-first century, we must learn from a wider framework how to use all health modalities, including clinical and prevention-oriented services, health promotion, and proactive efforts in the public and private sectors to effectively and economically preserve, protect, and promote the health of individuals and of greater society. The New Public Health, as public health did in the past, faces ethical issues that relate to health expenditures, priorities, and social philosophy. Throughout the course of this book, we discuss these issues and attempt to illustrate a balanced, modern approach towards the New Public Health. ",

As added up by Pope Clement VI at Avignon, the total of reported dead reached 23,840,000. In the absence of a concept of contagion, no serious alarm was felt in Europe until the trading ships brought their black burden of pestilence into Messina while other infected ships from the Levant carried it to Genoa and Venice. By January 1348 it penetrated France via Marseille, and North Africa via Tunis. Ship-borne along coasts and navigable rivers, it spread westward from Marseille through the ports of Languedoc to Spain and northward up the Rhone to Avignon, where it arrived in March. It reached Narbonne, Montpellier, Carcassone, and Toulouse between February and May, and at the same time in Italy spread to Rome and Florence and their hinterlands. Between June and August it reached Bordeaux, Lyon, and Paris, spread to Burgundy and Normandy into southern England. From Italy during the summer it crossed the Alps into Switzerland and reached eastward to Hungary. In a given area the plague accomplished its kill within four to six months and then faded, except in the larger cities, where, rooting into the close-quartered population, it abated during the winter, only to appear in spring and rage for another six months.\"",
