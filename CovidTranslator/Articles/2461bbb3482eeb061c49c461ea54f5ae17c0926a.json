            "text": "The CC chemokine ligand 3 (CCL3-macrophage inflammatory protein-1a) is capable of activating monocytes and lymphocytes and serves an important role in the initial recruitment of these cells to tissues following microbial infection (Cook et al., 1995; Domachowske et al., 2000) . In support of the importance for CCL3 in imparting functional signals to T cells are data from our laboratory demonstrating that instillation of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) into the brains of CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice results in an inability to clear virus from the central nervous system (CNS) (Trifilo et al., 2003) . MHV-infected CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice exhibited a significant reduction in the numbers of infiltrating virus-specific CD8 + T cells present within the brain indicating that trafficking was impaired. Moreover, the ability to produce IFN-g as well as the cytolytic activity of virus-specific CD8 + T cells was dramatically reduced in the absence of CCL3 signaling. Taken together, these data indicate that CCL3 signaling significantly enhances the differentiation of primed CD8 + T cells into effector cells that allows their release from secondary lymphoid organs into circulation and effective migration to the CNS. The present study was undertaken to characterize potential mechanisms by which CCL3 signaling imparts effector function to antigen-specific T cells following MHV infection of the CNS. To further understand the relationship between CCL3 signaling and T cell activation, CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were infected with MHV and the presence and activation state of DC-like cells within the brain and draining cervical lymph nodes (CLN) determined. Our results delineate a CCL3-dependent pathway of T cell activation that involves the maturation and activation of a subpopulation of (dendritic cells) DCs (CD11c + CD11b + CD8a \u00c0 ) within the CNS as well as influencing the accumulation of these cells within the CLN following MHV infection of the CNS.

We chose to focus our attention on markers that are associated with professional antigen presenting cells such as DC as recent studies have indicated DC-like cells can be detected within the brains under inflammatory conditions (Fisher and Reichmann, 2001; Fischer et al., 2000) . Furthermore, we have previously determined that CCL3 mRNA expression is detected within the CNS early (b3 days) and therefore may participate in the appearance of CD11c + cells within the brain following MHV infection (Trifilo et al., 2003) . Therefore, we sought to characterize the populations of CD11c + cells within the brain following MHV infection of CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. Results in Fig. 1A indicate the frequency of CD11c + cells present within the CNS of naRve CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice is b1%. However, within 2 days following intracranial infection with MHV, there is a marked increase in the frequency of CD11c + cells within the brains of both strains of mice (Fig. 1A) . Analysis of CD11b expression revealed that approximately 75% of CD11c + cells in both CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were also CD11b + (Fig. 1A) . CD11c + CD11b + cells isolated from the CNS of either CCL3 +/+ or CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice expressed little to no CD8a or DEC205 suggesting a phenotype similar to myeloid derived DC (CD11c + , CD11b + , CD8a \u00c0 , DEC205 \u00c0 ) ( Fig.  1B ) (Anjuere et al., 1999; Henri et al., 2001) . Increased CD8a and DEC205 expression on CD11c + CD11b \u00c0 cells indicated that the majority of the remaining CD11c + cells present within the brain were similar phenotypically to lymphoid derived DC (CD11c + , CD11b \u00c0 , CD8a + ) (Fig. 1B) (Anjuere et al., 1999; Henri et al., 2001) . Although the Fig. 1 . Analysis of dendritic cells (DCs) within the brain following MHV infection. (A) Cells were isolated from the brains of uninfected (naRve) or infected (day 2 p.i.)

Gated populations represent CD11c + CD11b + (upper-right quadrant) or CD11c + CD11b \u00c0 (lower-right quadrant) and numbers indicate frequencies of gated cells within the isolated population. (B) CD8a and DEC205 expression on CD11c + cells. CD11c + CD11b + cells from either MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ or CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at day 2 p.i. did not express detectable levels of either CD8a or DEC205 while expression of both CD8a and DEC205 was readily detectable on CD11c + CD11b \u00c0 cells present within the brains of both populations of mice at day 2 p.i. (C) Total numbers of CD8a + and CD8a \u00c0 DCs within the brains of MHV or sham-infected CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at days 2 and 5 p.i. Data presented represent an average cell number derived from two separate experiments with a minimum of 10 mice analyzed per experimental group. (D) CD8a \u00c0 cells isolated from brains of CCL3 +/+ or CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at day 2 p.i. were gated upon and CD80, CD86, and CD40 expression was determined by flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) for cells obtained from either CCL3 +/+ or CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice is indicated. Flow data shown in panels A, B, and D are representative of two separate experiments with a total of 10 mice for each experimental condition.",

Comparison of the total numbers of CD8a + cells within the brains of MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice revealed no dramatic differences between the two populations of mice at either 2 or 5 days p.i. (Fig. 1C) . In contrast, numbers of CD8a \u00c0 cells were increased by approximately 30% within the brains of MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ mice as compared to CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at day 2 p.i. However, by day 5 p.i., there were increased numbers of CD8a \u00c0 cells present in the brains of CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice when compared to CCL3 +/+ mice. In attempt to better evaluate the activation state of CD11c + cells within the brains of MHV-infected mice, we next determined the expression levels of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 (B-7.1), CD86 (B-7.2), and CD40 on CD8a \u00c0 cells within the CNS of CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice. We chose to focus on this subpopulation of DCs in more detail as this clearly was the predominant DC population within the brains of infected mice suggesting a potentially more important role in defense. Analysis of CD8a \u00c0 cells isolated from the brains of CCL3 +/+ mice at day 2 p.i. revealed these cells expressed detectable levels CD80, CD86, and CD40 as determined by measuring the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) (Fig. 1D ). Although MHV infection of CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice also resulted in enhanced expression of CD86 on the surface of CD8a \u00c0 cells, the MFI for both CD80 and CD40 was dramatically reduced as compared to CD8a \u00c0 cells within the brain of CCL3 +/+ mice at day 2 p.i. (Fig. 1D ). Together, these results indicate that although CCL3 signaling is not required for the appearance of DC-like cells within the brain, expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 is muted in the absence of CCL3 signaling.",

Although CD8a \u00c0 DCs isolated from the CLN of CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice expressed similar levels of CD80 and CD86 as compared to CCL3 +/+ (determined by MFI), expression of CD40 as well as MHC I and II were reduced as compared to CD8a \u00c0 cells isolated from MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ mice (Figs. 2D and E).",

To determine if CD8a \u00c0 DCs present within the CLN of infected CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were capable of secreting either chemokines or cytokines following MHV infection of the CNS, these cells were isolated and production determined by ELISA. CCL3 was readily detectable from CD8a \u00c0 DCs obtained from CCL3 +/+ mice while CCL3 was not detected in supernatants collected from CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 CD8a \u00c0 DCs (Fig. 3) . The CCL3 +/+ CD8a \u00c0 DC population secreted IL-12p70 with low-level production of IL-10 ( Fig. 3) . In contrast, the CD11c + CD11b + CD8a \u00c0 cells isolated from CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice secreted approximately 3-fold less IL-12p70 while IL-10 secretion was increased by 5-fold as compared to cells from CCL3 +/+ mice (Fig. 3) .",

T cells were isolated from the CLN of CCL3 +/+ and CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice at days 7 and 12 p.i. following intracranial infection with MHV and stimulated with peptides corresponding to either the immunodominant CD4 epitope present within the matrix (M) glycoprotein at residues 133-147 (M133-147) or the immunodominant CD8 epitope in the surface (S) glycoprotein spanning residues 510-518 (S510-518) and cytokine production by T cells determined by intracellular cytokine staining (Castro and Perlman, 1995; Xue et al., 1995) . The results presented in Table 1 indicate similar frequencies of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells from CCL3 +/+ mice produced IFN-g at days 7 and 12 p.i. Both CD4 + and CD8 + CCL3 +/+ T cells also secreted IL-2 following specific peptide exposure at day 7, although expression was limited to the acute stage of MHV infection as the frequency of IL-2producing cells was reduced at day 12 p.i. (Table 1 ). In contrast, the frequency of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells isolated from CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice secreting IFN-g following peptide stimulation was dramatically reduced.

In addition, only limited frequencies of CCL3 +/+ CD4 + and CD8 + T cells produced IL-10 following MHV infection whereas CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 CD4 + and CD8 + T cells displayed an overall increase in the frequency of IL-10 ( Table 1) .",

These data support and extend recent studies from our laboratory demonstrating an important role for CCL3 in generating effector anti-viral T cells capable of migrating to the brain in response to viral infection (Trifilo et al., 2003) . i.)

            "text": "The activation of DC and their mobilization to secondary lymphoid organs is thought to be a key step in the initiation of an adaptive immune response (Banchereau and Steinman, 1998). Recent studies have indicated that following infection of the CNS with Toxoplasma gondii, CD11c + cells are present within the brain and these cells were able to stimulate the proliferation of naRve T cells (Fisher and Reichmann, 2001) . Similarly, our results also indicate an increase in CD11c + cells within the CNS following viral infection, suggesting that these cells are likely critical for successful T cell priming following migration to draining lymph nodes. Whether these cells are present within the CNS by differentiation of local antigen presenting cells, or through migration of immature DC has not been determined and is currently under investigation. Regardless, our data imply that CCL3 expression and signaling contributes to the migration of CD8a \u00c0 CD11c + cells to secondary lymphoid tissue where they participate in priming of T cells. In support of this, we have shown that CCL3 is important in arming these cells with the capability to optimally stimulate antigen-specific T cells with the ability to fully differentiate into effector cells (Trifilo et al., 2003) . The data presented in this study support and extend these observations and indicate that these results may be the result of a combination of diminished expression of both MHC class I and II, reduced expression of CD40, as well as a shift in cytokine production by CD8a \u00c0 cells. Indeed, CD40L:CD40 mediated interactions between T cells and APC can enhance IL-12 production by DC and blockade of this interaction has been shown to result in reduced autoimmunity by down-regulating Th1 differentiation (Cella et al., 1996; Macatonia et al., 1995) . Accumulating evidence indicates that in addition to driving virus-specific T cell proliferation, the activation state of DCs can also directly influence the effector function of T cells through the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (Fischer et al., 2000; Maldonado-Lopez et al., 1999 Pulendran et al., 1999) . For example, following several viral and bacterial infections, CD8a + DCs have been shown to be able to secrete large amounts of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 both in vitro and in vivo and this results in a preferential expression of Th1-associated cytokines, such as IFN-g by responding T cells (Aliberti et al., 2000; Maldonado-Lopez et al., 1999 Pulendran et al., 1999; Reis e Sousa et al., 1997) . Until recently, the prevailing thought was that CD8a + DCs were primarily responsible for production of IL-12 and contributing to a Th1 response. However, recent studies have indicated that CD8a \u00c0 DCs also have the potential for secreting IL-12 and influencing the T cell response (Doxsee et al., 2003) . Our studies clearly indicate that CD8a \u00c0 DCs isolated from the draining CLN of MHV-infected CCL3 +/+ mice secrete IL-12 suggesting that these cells help influence a protective Th1-mediated immune response characterized by the majority of antigen-specific T cells expressing IFN-g rather than IL-10 (Table 1 ). In stark contrast is the data indicating that CD8a \u00c0 DCs present in the CLN of infected CCL3 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice predominantly secrete IL-10 and this correlates with limited IFN-g expression and enhanced expression of the Th2-associated cytokine IL-10 (Table 1) . Therefore, the data indicate that cytokine production, rather than the type of CD11c + cell, may control the predominant T cell immune response within the CLN. Taken together, these data point to an important role in CCL3 expression in linking innate and adaptive immune responses following viral infection of the CNS by contributing to the activation Fig. 3 .

However, it is important to note that there is the possibility of other chemokines and chemokine receptors participating in DC responses following viral infection. Indeed, the CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) is expressed on professional APC including macrophages and DCs and is thought to contribute to defense following microbial challenge by enhancing recruitment as well as production of antimicrobial products such as TNF-a and NO by these cells (Luster, 2002; McColl, 2002; Serbina et al., 2003) . In addition, the absence of CCR2 signaling results in diminished trafficking and accumulation of dendritic cells within secondary lymphoid tissues following antigenic challenge (Peters et al., 2000 (Peters et al., , 2001 Sato et al., 2000) . Studies are currently in progress to evaluate the contributions of additional chemokine signaling pathways that may also participate in DC activation and migration following coronavirus infection.",

Here, we have demonstrated a novel role for the chemokine CCL3 in enhancing the accumulation and activation of CD8a \u00c0 DCs within secondary lymphoid tissue and this correlates with altered T cell activation and differentiation following viral infection. These results indicate that CD8a \u00c0 DCs likely function in an APC-like role within the CLN following MHV infection and that these cells rely upon chemokine instruction to activate T cells. At a more fundamental level, the results presented demonstrate that chemokines serve as critical upstream signals in the innate immune response that later is important with regards to the initiation of a protective adaptive immune responses to viral infection.",

Brain samples were minced and homogenized into a single cell suspension followed by fractionation on a 70/30% Percoll gradient at 1300 \u00c2 g for 30 min. For isolation of mononuclear cells from the CLN, lymph nodes were homogenized using frosted glass slides and the resulting single cell suspension was treated with sterile H 2 O to lyse red blood cells. Due to the low frequency and numbers of CD11c + cells within the brain and CLN, samples from three to six mice were pooled for each experiment. To enrich for CD11c + CD11b + CD8a \u00c0 DCs, both brain and CLN samples were separately magnetically sorted by negative selection against CD8a using MACS microbeads coated with anti-CD8a (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
