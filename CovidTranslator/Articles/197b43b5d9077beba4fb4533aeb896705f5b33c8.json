Overlapping genes can undergo \"symmetric evolution\" (similar selection pressures on the two proteins) or \"asymmetric evolution\" (significantly different selection pressures on the two proteins). By sequence analysis of 75 pairs of homologous viral overlapping genes, I evaluated their accordance with one or the other model. Analysis of nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed that half of overlaps undergo asymmetric evolution, as the protein from one frame shows a number of substitutions significantly higher than that of the protein from the other frame. Interestingly, the most variable protein (often known to interact with the host proteins) appeared to be encoded by the de novo frame in all cases examined. These findings suggest that overlapping genes, besides to increase the coding ability of viruses, are also a source of selective protein adaptation.",

I then calculated the absolute value of the difference between them. The null hypothesis was a mean difference Orientation of overlapping genes, with the downstream frame having a shift of one nucleotide 3\u2032 with respect to the upstream frame. There are 3 types of codon position (cp): cp13 (bold character), in which the first position of the upstream frame overlaps the third position of the downstream frame; cp21 (underlined character), in which the second position of the upstream frame overlaps the first position of the downstream frame; cp32 (italic character), in which the third position of the upstream frame overlaps the second position of the downstream frame. Based on the genetic code, a nucleotide substitution at first codon position causes an amino acid change in 95.4% of cases, at second codon position in 100% of cases, and at third codon position in 28.4% of cases. Thus, nucleotide substitutions at the codon positions \"13\" and \"32\" are usually non-synonymous in one frame and synonymous in the other.

Furthermore, overlapping genes are subjected to a variety of selection pressures that are independent of the orientation of the overlapping frames relative to one another. Thus, it is hypothetically possible that an ancestral protein may be significantly more variable than a de novo protein under peculiar selective constraints.",

There are 3 types of codon position (cp): cp13 (bold character), in which the first position of the upstream frame overlaps the third position of the downstream frame; cp21 (underlined character), in which the second position of the upstream frame overlaps the first position of the downstream frame; cp32 (italic character), in which the third position of the upstream frame overlaps the second position of the downstream frame. Based on the genetic code, a nucleotide substitution at first codon position causes an amino acid change in 95.4% of cases, at second codon position in 100% of cases, and at third codon position in 28.4% of cases. Thus, nucleotide substitutions at the codon positions \"13\" and \"32\" are usually non-synonymous in one frame and synonymous in the other. Nucleotide substitutions at the codon position \"21\" are almost all non-synonymous in both frames.",
