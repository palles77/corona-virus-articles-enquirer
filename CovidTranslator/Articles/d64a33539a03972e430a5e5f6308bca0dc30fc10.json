            "text": "Progressive muscle weakness beginning at 6 months of age was observed in a male Persian-mix cat. Muscle atrophy and joint contracture progressed over the next 3 years. The cat had developed gait difficulty at 8 months of age. The cat died at age of 5 years and 3 months due to an acute respiratory disorder. The clinical, laboratory, necropsy and histopathological findings of the cat were consistent with those of muscular dystrophy. The cat was diagnosed as having laminin a2 (merosin)-deficient muscular dystrophy on the basis of immunohistochemical findings. The cat was born in an inbred colony, and another related cat exhibited similar clinical signs. Few cases of laminin a2-deficient muscular dystrophy have been reported in cats, and this report provides additional information about the disease. A 6-month-old castrated male Persian-mix cat was presented with a complaint of weakness when jumping. General physical examination revealed no remarkable findings. At 7 months of age, the cat showed dropped hocks in the pelvic limbs and mild muscle atrophy in the thighs. At 8 months of age, notable muscle atrophy in all four limbs and gait difficulty were evident. The cat was able to move by turning its body axis, but could not stand. Mental status, behaviour, proprioception, spinal reflexes, cranial nerves and sensation were all normal. At 1 year of age, joint contracture and marked muscle atrophy were observed in all four limbs. The dorsolumbar area also showed marked muscle atrophy. The cat was recumbent and was unable to move its body, but head and neck motion was relatively well preserved, despite limited movement of the temporomandibular joint. Food often spilled from the cat's mouth, and drinking of water was difficult. However, neither intravenous fluid administration nor force-feeding was required, as the cat managed to feed itself adequately, and dehydration was avoided by the addition of water to its food. As the cat tended to retain urine, manual bladder expression was required. Tension and contraction of the bladder appeared normal on palpation. After about 1 year of age, the rate of deterioration of the cat's condition slowed (Fig 1) . The cat's voice faded and was lost at about 3 years of age. Thereafter, there was little further deterioration until the cat died due to acute respiratory insufficiency at 5 years and 3 months of age. The cat ate well and maintained a normal weight and mentation throughout its life, with no clinical or observed evidence of pain.",

Serological testing (Idexx, Tokyo, Japan) showed that the cat was negative for feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen, and also for antibodies against feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and Toxoplasma gondii. Findings of urinalysis at 6 and 8 months and 2 years of age were unremarkable. Echocardiography at 7 months of age demonstrated slight enlargement of the left ventricular free wall (diastolic phase 9.4 mm; reference range 2.5e5.0 mm) and ventricular septum (diastolic phase 5.4 mm; reference range 2.5e5.0 mm).

Tissue samples of the sartorius and biceps muscles of the thigh were fixed in 10% formalin and processed routinely for paraffin sections. Histopathological examination of the specimens revealed severe muscle atrophy and diffuse perimysial infiltration by fatty tissue. The atrophic changes showed a diffuse distribution within the examined biopsy tissues, and the atrophic muscle fibres were angular in shape. The muscle fibres were markedly reduced in number with mild infiltration by mononuclear cells, which appeared to be macrophages or histiocytes. At 2 years and 8 months of age, a second muscle biopsy was performed to search for dystrophin. Fresh tissue samples of the sartorius and biceps muscles of the thigh were frozen in dry ice, and cryostat sections were made. However, the results of immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal anti-human dystrophin antibody (Novocastra, Newcastle, UK) were normal.",

The muscles in the head and neck and thoracic paraspinal muscles were relatively well preserved. The myocardium in the area of the ventricular septum and the left ventricular free wall was slightly enlarged. Diffuse haemorrhage and mild exudation were found in the lungs.

Within the muscle lesions, the intramuscular nerve branches and muscle spindles were well preserved (Fig 2) . The remaining muscle fibres varied in size and showed several types of degenerative change, including endomysial fibrosis and increased numbers of nuclei with occasional central nuclei. Similar changes were also observed in the longissimus and masseter muscles and the diaphragm, although these lesions were less prominent than those in the limbs. In the heart, changes were characterised by irregular arrangement, disarray and vacuolar changes of cardiac muscle fibres, and were consistent with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. In the lungs, there was diffuse thickening of the alveolar walls, as well as focal crystalline deposits of cholesterol and accumulation of foamy macrophages and lymphocytes. These changes were consistent with lipid pneumonia. In the nervous tissues, including the brain and spinal cord, nerve roots, ganglia and peripheral nerves, no significant pathological changes were visualised in paraffin sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin and Luxol fast blue. In the urinary bladder and the other viscera, there were no remarkable histological lesions.",

Monoclonal antibodies (1F9 and 5H2) (provided by Eva Engvall, Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, CA, USA), which had been characterised previously, were used for laminin a2-immunostaining (Leivo and Engvall 1988, O'Brien et al 2001) . Commercially available antibodies were used to assess other muscle proteins. The results of immunohistochemistry with these antibodies, except laminin a2, were equally positive in both this cat and the control cats. However, the muscle basement membrane from this cat was unreactive with both 1F9 and 5H2 antibodies against laminin a2, whereas those of the control cats were intensely immunoreactive with both antibodies (Table 1, Fig 3) . These results indicated an absence of laminin a2 in the skeletal muscles of this cat.",

            "text": "The final diagnosis in the present cat was laminin a2 (merosin)-deficient muscular dystrophy. The results of immunohistochemistry indicated a defect of laminin a2 in the muscle basement membrane. In human medicine, muscular dystrophies are described according to whether they are inherited conditions characterised by varying degrees of muscle weakness that are not neurogenic (Emery 2001a) . Then whether they are associated with specific defects in proteins, which are normally expressed at least in the skeletal muscles (Emery 2001a) . Finally, mitochondrial myopathies, as well as myopathies associated with characteristic pathological lesions such as central cores or nemaline rods, are excluded (Emery 2001a ). Recently, muscular dystrophies have been classified into more than 30 different forms, according to whether they are due to defects in muscle proteins such as dystrophin, laminin a2, a7 integrin, dysferlin, caveolin-3, sarcoglycans, telethonin, myotilin, calpain-3, poly-A binding protein, Family tree. The circles and boxes indicate females and males, respectively. The clear circles and boxes indicate clinically normal cats, and the coloured boxes indicate affected cats. The present cat and its siblings were inbred. There were two affected male cats (the present case and an affected sibling), two clinically normal male cats and two clinically normal female cats. emerin and laminin A/C (Emery 2001a) . Laminins are glycoproteins which are major components of the basement membrane and consist of a, b and g subunits (Wewer and Engvall 1996, Hayashi and Arahata 1997) . Laminin a2 is one of the five subclasses of laminin a chains (Wewer and Engvall 1996, Hayashi and Arahata 1997) . Laminins which include the laminin a2 chain have been called merosin and are found in the basement membranes of skeletal and cardiac muscles, Schwann cells and the placenta (Leivo and Engvall 1988, Hayashi and Arahata 1997) . Muscular dystrophy caused by laminin a2 deficiency is called merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, and shows autosomal recessive inheritance in humans (Tome et al 1994 , Helbling-Leclerc et al 1995 , Hayashi and Arahata 1997 , Emery 2001b .",

These two signs were evident in the present cat. It is considered that muscle atrophy and joint contracture are characteristic clinical features of the disease, differing from those of hypertrophic feline muscular dystrophy. Although the present cat showed no evident neurological abnormality, peripheral nerve involvement has been described in three cats with laminin a2-deficient muscular dystrophy and also in merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy in humans (Shorer et al 1995 , O'Brien et al 2001 , Poncelet et al 2003 . In the present case pathological examinations of the nervous system were performed using only paraffin sections, and further specific investigations including ultrastructural studies would be needed to evaluate the morphological changes in the peripheral nerves. Cardiac changes similar to those of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy were recognised in the present cat. The relationship between the cardiac lesions and laminin a2 deficiency remains unclear, as the cardiac changes have not been described in previously reported cats with laminin a2-deficient muscular dystrophy (O'Brien et al 2001 , Poncelet et al 2003 . Although the present cat showed a tendency for urine retention, no pathological changes which could have caused dysuria were identified.",
