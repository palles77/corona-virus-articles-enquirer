The resultant 3358 nucleotides contain 6 open reading frames (ORFs) with homologies to ORFs 2 through 7 of the European strain of the PRRS virus and other members of the free-standing genus of arteriviruses. Both VR-2332 and the European isolate (called the Lelystad virus) have been identified as infectious agents responsible for the swine disease called PRRS. Comparative sequence analysis indicates that there are degrees of amino acid identity to the Lelystad virus open reading frames ranging from 55% in ORF 5 to 79% in ORF 6. Hydropathy profiles indicate that the ORFs of VR-2332 and Lelystad virus correspond structurally despite significant sequence differences. These results are consistent with the biological similarities but distinct serological properties of North American and European isolates of the virus.",

[13] and a partial sequence was determined by Conzelmann et al. [4] . The positive-strand genome encodes eight open reading frames (ORFs) whose arrangement of genes is similar to that of coronaviruses [17] and arteriviruses [10, 15] . The two most 5'open reading frames (ORFs la and lb) likely encode the viral RNA polymerase. ORFs 2, 5, and 6 appear to encode structural proteins associated with viral membranes, and ORF 7 is believed to encode a nucleocapsid protein. These proteins are expressed from a nested set of RNA transcripts with overlapping 3' ends. While this expression strategy is shared with the Coronaviridae, the physical properties of the arteriviruses originally placed them in the family Togaviridae. Plagemann and Moenning [15] have proposed a new group, the arteriviruses, to encompass viruses with these dual properties. This free standing group includes the PRRS virus, equine arteritis virus (EAV, [5] ), lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV, [15] ), and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV, [81).",

The gap between the 5' end of clone 416 and the beginning ofORF 2 (contained in both clones 712 and 761) was sequenced from both ends by using VR-2332-specific primers. Additional sequencing was performed to confirm the sequence on the opposite strand (Fig. 1) . With this strategy, a sequence of 3358 nucleotides was obtained on both strands from two to six independent clones.

While VR-2332 is more related to the Lelystad virus than to other arteriviruses, the homologies were lower than expected for two viruses that cause the same disease. Substitutions, detetions, and additions occurred throughout the sequences. The predicted proteins were different in molecular weights, isoetectric points, and predicted N-linked glycosylation sites (Table 2) . When other characteristics of the predicted proteins, such as the hydropathy profiles and percent basic character were compared the two viruses appeared more similar than was indicated by amino acid sequence. In addition, dot matrix analysis utilizing a sliding window of 21 amino acids with a requirement of 13 identical residues at each location showed clearly that all of the ORFs were nearly colinear between VR-2332 and LV (data not shown). Figure 2 shows the hydropathy profiles for ORFs 2 through 7 of VR-2332 and LV.

A high level of nucleotide sequence diversity between both PRRSV isolates was observed, which was reflected in comparative Northern blotting in which signal intensities were approximately 100-fold greater for homologous compared to heterologous hybridizations. Although the amino acid homologies are substantially less than expected for viruses that appear to cause an identical disease, the findings were consistent with the striking antigenic diversity reported from serological studies [21] . These studies showed that there is little serological cross-reactivity between European and North American isolates of the PRRS virus. We infer that the antigenic differences between VR-2332 and Lelystad virus are due to immunological responses of swine to the dissimilar regions of the viruses. In contrast to the differences noted between the European and U.S. isolates, preliminary observations indicate the North American isolates are highly conserved [11, 12] .",

The hydropathy profiles comparing each ORF indicated that protein structures were conserved despite the extensive sequence differences. The algorithm clearly showed similar regions of uncharged and charged amino acids, in each ORF of VR-2332 and LV and may predict regions which span or do not span the membrane. We conclude that VR-2332 proteins are similar in structure and function to those of LV, but that the extensive amino acid differences in the proteins account for the extensive differences in serological crossreactivity.",

Figure 3 , showing a nucleotide sequence phylogeny comparison ofVR-2332, Lelystad virus, LDV, and EAV ORF 5, indicates that the PRRS viruses are related and different from LDV and EAV. It also indicates that the PRRS viruses are more related to LDV than to EAV. Analyses of other ORFs including ORFs 6 and 7, which are more conserved than ORF 5, gave the identical result. Also, the amino acid similarity of LDV to the PRRS viruses is 59 to 70% (Table I) , whereas EAV is only 29-49% similar to LDV (data not shown). Hence, the close similarities of PRRS virus isolates and LDV raise the intriguing possibility that the PRRS virus is an LDV variant which adapted to a new host species and evolved rapidly away from LDV in its new environment. VR-2332 and LV may have diverged shortly thereafter, or the two PRRS virus isolates may have evolved independently from different LDV variants.",
