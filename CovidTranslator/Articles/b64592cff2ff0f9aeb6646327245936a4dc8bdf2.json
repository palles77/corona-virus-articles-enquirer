Formation of a pseudoknot is indicated by the imino proton spectrum. Imino protons are observed consistent with formation of two helical stem regions; nuclear Overhauser enhancements between imino protons show that the two stem regions stack to form a continuous helix. In the stem regions, nucleotide conformations (3'-endo, anti) and internucleotide distances, derived from two-dimensional correlated, spectroscopy and two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectra, are characteristic of A-form geometry. The data suggest minor distortion in helical stacking at the junctions of stems and loops. The model of the pseudoknot is consistent with the structure originally proposed by Pleij et al. 1981; Heerschap, 1985; Hall et aZ., 1989) and Escherichia coli 5 S rRNA (122 nucleotides) Leontis 437",

Pleij and co-workers proposed that a novel tertiary interaction, a pseudoknot allows turnip yellows mosaic virus (TYMV$) RNA to adopt a three-dimensional structure similar to that of tRNA (Rietveld et al., 1983 (Rietveld et al., , 1984 Pleij et al., 1985 Pleij et al., , 1986 . The exact function of the tRNA-like structures at the 3' ends of the plant viral RNAs is unclear. The tRNA-like structure, and thus the pseudoknot, is required for viral replication in brome mosaic virus RNA (Dreher BE Hall, 1988a) and may be a relic of a primitive telomere (Weiner & Maizels, 1987) .

A pseudoknot occurs, as shown in Figure 1 , when nucleotides within a loop pair with nucleotides outside the loop, forming a second stem (Studnicka et al., 1978 ). An idealized model for pseudoknot structure was proposed on the basis of biochemical data and structural analogy to tRNA (Pleij et al., 1985; Dumas et al., 1987) . The stem regions stack coaxially in an undistorted A-form geometry. The two loop regions in the pseudoknot are inequivalent; loop 1 crosses the deep major groove of stem 2 and loop 2 crosses the shallow and wide minor groove of stem 1. Chemical and enzymatic mapping experiments, mutational analysis and the functional similarities of the viral RNAs to normal tRNA are consistent with this model (Rietveld et al., 1982; Joshi et al., 1983; van Belkum et al., 1988; Dreher t Hall, 1988b ). An oligonucleotide of 19 nucleotides was shown to form a pseudoknot using nuclease mapping and absorbance melting studies (Puglisi et al., 1988) . However, no structural data on the three-dimensional conformation of a pseudoknot have been presented.",

Transcription reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for approximately 2 h in 40 mM-Tris.HCl (pH gl at 37 \"(7). 1 mM-spermidine, 5 rnM-dithiothreitol, 001 y0 (v/v) Triton X100, 80 mg polyethylene glycol/ml (relative molecular mass = WOO), 36% mM-MgCl,, 4 mM each nucleoside triphosphate and 5 mM-GMP. The DNA concentration was 63 PM per strand and T7 RNA polymerase was used at 30 units/pi. Typical yields were between 10 to 15 nmol of strand per ml of reaction (2 to 3 A,,, units/ ml). For n.m.r. quantities, reaction volumes were 50 to 75 ml. Reactions were quenched by the addition of EDTA to 50 mM. The reaction mixtures were extracted with phenol, then with chloroform and were precipitated with ethanol. Full-length transcripts were isolated from a denaturing (7 M-urea) 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel. Reactions yielded 2 major bands corresponding to the correct length and to transcript with an additional nucleotide at the 3' terminus. Gel electrophoresis allowed good resolution of these products. Resolution was worse when reactions were primed using GMP. Incorporation of GMP at position 1 was about 80% efficient as determined by 2-dimensional thin-layer chromatography analysis of total RNase digests of transcripts primed with GMP and labeled with [a-32P]CTP (Nishimura et aZ.. 1967) .",

An AH2 misassigned as a purine H8 will lead to an erroneous assignment pathway that shunts across strands. AH2 protons generally have only very weak NOES in the H2'/ H3'/H4'/H$/H5\" region. The AH2 protons, once assigned from the imino spectrum, act as a check on the H8/H6 + Hl' assignment pathway. Assignment of nonhelical regions follows the above protocol if the nucleotides are in a stacked, relatively A-form geometry (i.e. the anticodon loop of tRNAPh'); however, assignment pathways are much more difficult to obtain in unstacked regions. This is a serious problem for RNA structure determination by n.m.r., since frequently the non-helical regions of the structure are of primary interest.",

In addition, uridine imino protons involved in a Watson-Crick A. U base-pair will have a strong NOE to the adenine H2, which is separated by only 1.9 A from the imino proton.

Gzz base-pair of stem 2, remains relatively sharp up to 5O\"C, whereas the imino resonance from G3. C1 3 pair 3 has completely broadened. The sequential order of broadening of the imino resonances could be due to differences in either the thermodynamic stability or the kinetic behavior of the two stems. Data discussed in the following paper support the latter. The region between 7.0 p.p.m. and 8.6 p.p.m. contains resonances from AH8, GH8, CH6 and UH6 as well as AH2 protons. For the oligonucleotide described here, this region should contain 29 resonances. UH5, CH5 and sugar Hl' protons resonate in the region between 5.0 p.p.m. and 6.2 p.p.m. The spectrum can be significantly simplified in these two regions through selective deuteriation. Deuteriation of pyrimidine residues at the 5 position is experimentally straightforward for either the nucleotides or the DNA or RNA strands (Wataya & Hayatsu, 1972; Brush et aE., 1988) . Since 11 of the 26 nucleotides of the oligonucleotide are uridine residues, UPT deuteriated at the 5 position was incorporated using T7 RNA polymerase. The region between 5.0 p.p.m. and 62 p.p.m. is significantly simplified by the elimination of 11 UH5 resonances. Deuteriation of UH5s also improves the appearance of the 7.0 to 8.6 p.p.m. region of the spectrum because the UH6 resonances are singlets; the presence of deuterium in the H5 position eliminates the splitting of these resonances.",

The C,(H6) (7.93 p.p.m.) was the only unassigned CH6-CH5 cross peak in the COSY spectrum. The C,(H5) (5.96 p.p.m.) has a second weak cross peak at 5.50 p.p.m. due to a small amount of 5' hairpin structure present . The 5'-terminal G I (H8) was identified by incorporation of dsGMP during transcription. Since T7 RNA polymerase preferentially primes synthesis with GMP rather than GTP, the d*G is selectively incorporated at position 1 (Sampson & Uhlenbeck, 1988). G,(H8) (8.24 p,p.m.) has a NOE to its own Hl' (5.90 p.p.m.) and to the C,(Hl'). NOE connectivities are also observed between loop 1 nucleotides ( Fig. 5(b) ). The farthest downfield aromatic resonance at 8.53 p.p.m. is assigned as A, (HS) and the resonance at 821 p.p.m. is A,(H2). These assignments were confirmed by the presence of both these resonances after incorporation of d*GTP (data not shown). The A,(HB) has a strong cross peak to the A,(Hl') at 6.09 p.p.m. The UH6 at 7.74 p.p.m. has a NOE to the A,(Hl').

Scalar (J) coupling information is used to characterize the sugar conformation as north (approx. C-3'-endo, 1' = 18\") or south (approx. C-2'. endo, P = 162\"). For smaller RNA molecules, the sugar conformation can be more precisely determined using additional coupling information (i.e. H2'-H3', HY-H4') (Davis et al., 1996) ; this information is limited in the case of the 26 nucleotide molecule studied here. The two families of puckers represent points of minimum energy for the pseudorotation phase angle, P (Olson & Sussman, 1982; Olson, 1982) . Since the rate of interconversion between these two conformers is fast on the n.m.r. time-scale, the value of J,,,, for a nucleotide is an average of J,,,, for north (J,,, < 1 Hz) and south (J,,.,, = 8-O Hz) conformers weighted by the relative population of each.

Although data indicate some distortion from A-form stacking between stem 1 and stem 2 at the junction between stem and loop regions, the model is still consistent with the observed biological activity of the pseudoknots in the viral tRNA-like structures. The stacked stem regions of the pseudoknot structure in TYMV RNA mimics the seven base-pairs in the acceptor stem of tRNA\"\", allowing aminoacylation by valyl-tRNA synthetase (Pleij et al., 1985) . Florentz & Gieg& (1986) have mapped the interactions of valyl-tRNA synthetase with the TYMV RNA using chemical and enzymatic probes. The interactions with the \"acceptor stem\" formed by the pseudoknot are along the region equivalent to C, to C,,. It is this covalently connected phosphodiester backbone that will appear to the synthetase as a continuous A-form helix (Fig. 8) . Mutations in the base-pairs of a similar pseudoknot in brome mosaic virus RNA drastically reduced the aminoacylation by synthetase (Dreher & Hall, 19886) . Thus, a pseudoknot has two sides: one is a fairly undistorted A-form helix (the left side of the model shown in Fig. 8 ) and the other contains both loop regions as well as the junctions of the loops with the stems (Fig. 9) . Even if undistorted, the loop-junction side of the structure would not appear to a protein as an A-form helix.",

The proposed distortion in the pseudoknot A-form geometry occurs in the region of the junction of the two loops with the stems (Fig. 9) . Distortion of the structure, mainly localized to the stack between G3 and GZ2 probably reduces unfavorable electrostatic interactions between phosphate groups at the loop-stem junctions.",
