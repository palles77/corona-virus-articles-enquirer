            "text": "In rats respiratory tract infections due to Sendai virus and coronavirus usually are transient, but they can have long-lasting consequences when accompanied by Mycoplasma pulmonis infections. Morphological alterations in the tracheal epithelium and a potentiation of the inflammatory response evoked by sensory nerve stimulation (\"neurogenic inflammation \") are evident nine weeks after the infections begin, but the extent to which these changes are present at earlier times is not known. In the present study we characterized these abnormalities in the epithelium and determined the extent to which they are present 3 and 6 weeks after the infections begin. We also determined the magnitude of the potentiation of neurogenic inflammation at these times, whether the potentiation can be reversed by glucocorticoids, and whether a proliferation of blood vessels contributes to the abnormally large amount of plasma extravasation associated with this potentiation. To this end, we studied Long-Evans rats that acquired these viral and mycoplasmal infections from other rats. We found that the tracheal epithelium of the infected rats had ten times as many Alcian blue-PAS positive mucous cells as did that of pathogen-free rats; but it contained none of the serous cells typical of pathogen-free rats, so the total number of secretory cells was not increased. In addition, the epithelium of the infected rats had three times the number of ciliated cells and had only a third of the number of globule leukocytes. In response to an injection of capsaicin (150 btg/kg i.v.), the tracheas of the infected rats developed an abnormally large amount of extravasation of two tracers, Evans blue dye and Monastral blue pigment, and had an abnormally large number of Monastral blue-labeled venules, particularly in regions of mucosa overlying the cartilaginous rings. This abnormally large amount of extravasation was blocked by dexamethasone (1 rag/day i.p. for 5 days). We conclude that M. pulmonis infections, exacerbated at the outset by viral infections, result within three weeks in the transformation of epithelial serous cells into mucous cells, the proliferation of ciliated cells, and the depletion of globule leukocytes. They also cause a proliferation of mediatorsensitive blood vessels in the airway mucosa, which is likely",

These changes reach their peak within 3-7 days and are largely resolved within two weeks. However, if the viral infections occur in the presence of infections caused by Mycoplasma pulmonis, the resulting pathological changes in the airways are much more severe than those caused by any of the organisms independently; and chronic airway disease develops (Schoeb et al. 1985; Schoeb and Lindsey 1987) .",

The magnitude of the neurogenic inflammatory response was inferred from the amount of plasma extravasation evoked by a standardized dose of capsaicin, a drug that is known to induce neurogenic inflammation and thereby to increase vascular permeability (Gamse et al. 1980; Lundberg et al. 1984; Persson et al. 1986; McDonald 1988 a) . The amount of plasma extravasation was quantified with Evans blue dye ; it was also measured with Monastral blue pigment, which -unlike Evans blue -does not cross the endothelium of intact blood vessels (Joris et al. 1982; McDonald 1988b) . This property of Monastral blue enabled us to verify that the extravasation of the tracers was due to an increase in vascular permeability and not to hemodynamic changes evoked by the capsaicin (Makara et al. 1967; Mitchell et al. 1984) . The effect of glucocorticoids on this system was examined because these drugs are known to inhibit the increase in vascular permeability produced by chemical mediators and to ameliorate inflammatory diseases of the airways (Svensjo and Roempke 1985; Andersson and Persson 1988) .",

Light mierographs of toluidine blue-stained epoxy sections of tracheal mucosa from vehicle-treated rats. 6 shows the relatively thin epithelium of a pathogen-free rat, consisting mainly of cuboidal and low columnar cells. The ciliated cells are outnumbered by non-ciliated cells, most of which contain blue-back granules typical of serous ceils (arrow). 7 shows the epithelium of an infected rat, which contains tall columnar cells and is twice as thick as that of the pathogen-free rat. The epithelium has abundant ciliated cells and contains several mucous cells with pale purple granules (arrow). Scale bar for 2-7 = i0 ~tm 330 Values are means \u2022 S.E. of data from pathogen-free rats and from infected rats that acquired infections during the 6 week experiment or were infected at the outset. Electron microscopic counts were made on mucosal specimens from 3 tracheas in each group. Only nucleated profiles of epithelial cells in contact with the airway lumen were counted. \"Other types of cells\" include epithelial cells that had neither cilia nor secretory granules. Light microscopic counts were made of secretory cells with magenta or blue-purple granules in Alcian blue-PAS stained sections of tracheas of 4 vehicle-treated rats in each group. * Significantly different from corresponding values for pathogen-free rats, as determined by Student's t test (p < 0.05) sections stained with toluidine blue, the granules were pale blue or violet, contrasting with the darkly stained cytoplasm (Fig. 7) .",

The epithelial surface of the infected rats had an undulating contour and in some regions had crypt-like infoldings in which secretory cells were numerous. The epithelial cells were 50% more densely packed in the infected rats (187 cells/ram; Table 1 ) and thus were only 68% as wide (5.4_+0.1 gm) as those of pathogen-free rats. However, because the elongation of the epithelial cells was accompanied by narrowing, cell volume (approximately 800 gm 3) was not appreciably different in pathogen-free and infected rats.",

The latter possibility is consistent with evidence that mucous cells of the tracheal epithelium are not stimulated by parasympathetic agonists but are degranulated by irritants such as mustard oil, sulfur dioxide, ammonia, and tobacco smoke (Florey et al. 1932; Lamb and Reid 1968; Jeffery 1978) , which activate sensory nerves, and by electrical stimulation of vagal sensory axons (McDonald 1988 b) .",

For example, intravenous capsaicin does not increase vascular permeability in all vascular beds but instead exerts its effect in proportion to the amount of substance P in the tissue Lundberg et al. 1984) . Furthermore, intravenous capsaicin can mimic the changes in vascular permeability produced in the tracheal mucosa by vagal stimulation and substance P injection Mc Donald 1988a) , which do not evoke the same reflex changes as capsaicin. Also, the endothelial gaps in postcapillary venules that are responsible for the extravasation induced by capsaicin, vagal stimulation, and substance P (McDonald  1988 a, b) would not be expected to result from reflex hemodynamic changes. Finally, when capsaicin is applied directly to the tracheal mucosa, skin or conjunctiva of the eye, the resulting plasma extravasation coincides with the region of the application, an unlikely finding if caused by reflex hemodynamic changes (Jancso 1960; Lundberg and Saria 1982) .",

We found both to be true: Monastral blue-labeled vessels in the tracheas of infected rats not only were more intensely colored, but they were also more numerous. In evidence of the latter, many of the labeled vessels in the infected rats were in regions of the mucosa overlying cartilaginous rings, sites that were nearly devoid of labeled vessels in pathogen-fi'ee rats. This change indicates that the infections can increase the number of mediator-sensitive blood vessels in the tracheal mucosa and that the proliferation of these vessels contributes to the augmented neurogenic inflammatory response.",

This was evidenced by high serological titers to the organism, electron microscopic visualization on the airway epithelium of organisms with the typical morphology of M. pulmonis (Nelson and Lyons 1965) , and characteristic pathological changes in the airway mucosa (Lindsey et al. 1971 ). Furthermore, the abnormally large amount of plasma extravasation associated with neurogenic inflammation in the infected rats appeared to be due in part to the proliferation of blood vessels, which is one of the manifestations of chronic infections such as those caused by M. pulmonis. Finally, M. pulmonis infections, produced in the laboratory by intranasal inoculation of the organisms, can potentiate neurogenic inflammation in the rat trachea in the absence of viral infections (McDonald and Lindsey, unpublished observations).",
