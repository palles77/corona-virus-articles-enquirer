This is a retrospective study of this multipronged approach to containing VRE. The adequacy of rectal swab sampling for VRE was assessed in a substudy of 111 patients. The prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)/VRE co-colonization or co-infection also was determined. Results: A total of 19,574 contacts were identified. Between April and June 2005, 5095 patients were screened, yielding 104 VRE carriers, 54 of whom (52%) were detected in the first 2 weeks of hospital-wide screening. The initial positive yield of 11.4% of persons actively screened declined to 4.2% by the end of June 2005. Pulsed-field typing revealed 1 major clone and several minor clones among the 151 total VRE cases, including 4 clinical cases. Hospital-wide physical segregation of contacts from other patients was difficult to achieve in communal wards. Co-colonization or co-infection with MRSA, which was present in 52 of 151 cases (34%) and the indefinite electronic tagging of positive VRE status strained limited isolation beds. Analysis of 2 fecal or rectal specimens collected 1 day apart may detect at least 83% of VRE carriers. Conclusion: A multipronged strategy orchestrated by a central task force curbed but could not eradicate VRE. Control measures were confounded by hospital infrastructure and high MRSA endemicity.

No more VRE cases were seen until a large hospital-wide outbreak in March 2005, for which there was no previous local precedence.

In retrospect, it could be argued that we did not actually have a true nonendemic state, and that there was a transition from an initial monoclonal VRE outbreak in the hematology ward in 2004 to a multiclonal, hospital-wide spread in 2005.

In contrast to the 4 separate screening stool samples used by Christiansen et al, 2 only 2 samples per patient were usually analyzed, which detected 83% of carriers.

Although risks included coexisting diabetes and prolonged hospitalizations, the stay in crowded communal wards was the biggest infection control challenge. Interbed spacing of , 3 feet, limited toilet facilities (Fig 1) , and a low nurse-to-patient ratio were among the problems. Physical segregation was artificial, and dedicating nursing teams to separate cohorts of patients was impossible. A transient attempt to improve interbed spacing by reducing the number of beds per cubicle was abruptly reversed by pressure from bed management and the high hospital occupancy rates. The cancellation of surgical electives to facilitate patient segregation movements affected costs and inconvenienced patients. To facilitate appropriate patient placement, long delays in admissions from the emergency department ensued. Similar bed ''crunches'' limited ring-fencing of vulnerable patients to parent wards and forced discontinuation of the ''unknown'' category 2 weeks into the outbreak. Bed management systems were stressed by the need to physically segregate patients according to the different outbreak categories while maintaining their class status. Lack of resources prevented us from doing environmental screening, although this would have been useful, 10 because cleaning practices could not be supervised adequately. Proactive outpatient screening also was limited.",

Centralized planning, coordination, and dissemination of information from a multidisciplinary task force with a strong mandate from senior management were important. The experience dealing with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003 allowed us to respond quickly to this new threat. Coordinated outbreak control measures were introduced within hours of the first VRE Task Force meeting. Typing using PFGE provided insight into the outbreak and nonoutbreak strains but was limited in its turnaround time. Identifying the outbreak clone by a faster method could have prompted earlier focused strategies. The existence of a VRE clone specific to ESRF patients suggests the need for a coordinated national effort to study VRE prevalence in community dialysis centers. Given our high background MRSA endemicity, determining MRSA status before the creation of VRE cohorts was imperative, as evidenced by the fact that more than 1/3 of cases were co-colonized or co-infected with MRSA Although this and the indefinite tagging of VRE-positive status stretched our limited isolation facilities, it certainly highlighted the need to also control endemic MRSA. Educating staff unfamiliar with VRE was challenging, but at least half of the staff attended more than 20 lectures held throughout the outbreak. Although an audit showed a noncompliance rate of 23.4% of 260 vancomycin orders, it offered opportunities to further educate prescribers. The scale of the outbreak necessitated dissemination of information to the public through the media and other resources. Although this prompted several claims for compensation from affected patients, it made it easier for the public to understand the constrained processes within the hospital during the outbreak.",
