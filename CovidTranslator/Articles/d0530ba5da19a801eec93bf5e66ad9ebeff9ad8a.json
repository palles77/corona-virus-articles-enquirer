Within the extracranial compartment, the two gross anatomical subdivisions are the spinal cord and the neuromuscular system (nerve roots, spinal nerves, peripheral nerves, neuromuscular junctions and muscle). Upper motor neuron lesions affect the spinal cord, and LMN lesions can affect the C6-T2 and L4-S3 segments of the spinal cord, as well as the neuromuscular system (see box on page 362). \u271c Spinal cord localization The four segments into which the spinal cord is clinically divided (C1-C5, C6-T2, T3-L3, L4-S3) are responsible for specific neurological signs when affected by disease processes (Table 1 ). Asymmetry or lateralization of neurological signs needs to be carefully evaluated. Lateralized lesions affecting the brainstem, or C1-C5 or C6-T2 spinal segments, can cause hemiparesis and ipsilateral, unilateral proprioceptive deficits. Monoparesis can be observed in very lateralized lesions of the spinal cord, that are usually at the level of intumescences and may be associated with neurogenic muscle atrophy (Fig 2) . \u271c Neuromuscular localization Localization of lesions to the neuromuscular system can be very challenging as disease can affect the nerve, neuromuscular junction or muscle, separately or collectively. In general, lesions affecting the neuromuscular system can cause flaccid muscle tone, paresis, muscle atrophy, decreased spinal reflexes and, very occasionally, cranial nerve dysfunction. These lesions should affect all limbs, which helps to distinguish them from focal spinal lesions affecting the lower motor neurons. A pure sensory peripheral nerve problem causes ataxia without paresis, decreased postural reactions and decreased to absent deep and superficial sensation; while a muscular disease can cause paresis/ plegia, weakness and/or stiffness, decreased spinal flexor reflexes (extensors usually intact), muscle atrophy or hypertrophy (rare) and possibly muscle pain. Decreased postural reactions can be identified with muscle disease but they reflect the reduced strength of the animal rather than being a true abnormality.",

In general, worsening of neurological deficits has been reported in the first 24 h and stabilization and/or improvement of the neurological condition is usually observed. 5 Deterioration of clinical signs after a vascular event is due to multiple factors, including edema formation, accumulation of intracellular calcium, free radical production and secondary membrane permeability damage. 5 The final result is cellular necrosis.

Many theories are reported in the literature to explain the route by which the intervertebral disc material enters the spinal cord vasculature; mild traumatic events or migration of the disc material into the spinal arteries due to persistence of a common vascular connection between the intervertebral disc and the spinal cord have been postulated. 30, 31 Cats with fibrocartilaginous embolic myelopathy typically present with a peracute/acute onset of asymmetrical spinal cord-related signs, which may progress over the first 24 h. 30 Spinal palpation does not elicit pain, and any spinal cord segment may be involved, although the intumescences are most frequently affected. [30] [31] [32] Definitive diagnosis relies on histopathological confirmation; 31 for this reason, ante-mortem diagnosis is reached by elimination of other causes of myelopathy. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may detect neutrophilic pleocytosis and/or increased total protein levels. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most sensitive test for detection of ischemic infarctions and is characterized by a hyperintense signal on T2weighted images, iso-or mildly hypointense signal on T1-weighted images and mild contrast enhancement after 3-7 days. 9, 32 Treatment is supportive and the prognosis is guarded, although depends on lesion localization and the severity of clinical signs. In cats that recover, improvement is seen within 2-6 weeks of disease onset. 32 Intervertebral disc disease Intervertebral disc disease is relatively uncommon in cats, with an incidence of 0.12% of all neurological diseases. 19, 33 As in dogs, disc protrusions (Hansen's type II) and extrusions (Hansen's type I) have been reported in the literature, although Hansen's type I disease predominates in cats. 33 Where Hansen's type II disc disease occurs, it most commonly affects the cervical region, with bulging of the annulus fibrosus into the spinal canal. 34 However, this is often considered an incidental finding.",

            "text": "Spinal trauma is an important cause of spinal cord dysfunction in cats. 38 The most common traumatic conditions in cats include thoracolumbar vertebral fracture and luxations, sacrocaudal (coccygeal) subluxation/luxation, traumatic ischemia and disc extrusion. 8, 9, 23, 24, 39 In general, spinal trauma can be due to an event directly injuring the cord (contusion/concus sion/laceration) or to a condition affecting the surrounding structures (meninges, vertebrae, intervertebral disc) with secondary compression of the spinal cord. Approximately 20% of cats with traumatic spinal injuries also have acute intervertebral disc extrusion secondary to the trauma. 23 Although all segments of the spine are susceptible to trauma, the cervicothoracic, thoracolumbar, lumbosacral and sacrocaudal (coccygeal) junctions are the most common sites of avulsion, fractures and luxation. 23, 40 Deep pain perception in affected limbs is the most important prognostic indicator following spinal trauma. 8, 24 Lack of deep pain perception associated with luxated/fractured vertebrae indicates a poor prognosis due to the functional transection of the spinal cord implied by complete sensory defects. 8, 24 In sacrocaudal (coccygeal) subluxation/luxation, transection of the nerves forming the caudal part of the cauda equina (pudendal and sciatic nerve roots) is frequently reported. In these patients, particular attention should be paid to the perineal reflex, deep pain sensation in genital, anal and tail structures, and the possibility of urinary and fecal incontinence ( Fig 5) . 8, 24, 41 Survey spinal radiographs will assist with initial evaluation of the patient. Approximately 20% of patients with thoracolumbar fractures have a second spinal column fracture/lux ation; 23 therefore, radiographs of the whole spine should be obtained in any cat with spinal trauma, 8 together with survey chest radiographs and abdominal ultrasound. Sedation may be required to ensure well positioned radiographs, but care should be taken if this is the case, due to the ensuing relaxation of the epaxial musculature and the potential for further destabilization of the spine. Advanced imaging, including myelography, CT myelography or MRI, Intervertebral disc disease may develop insidiously, starting with constipation, reluctance to jump, low tail carriage and spinal hyperesthesia.",

Typically, FIP is considered a disease affecting the inner (ependyma) and outer (meninges) CNS surfaces. 55 Although cats of any age may be affected by the neurological form of FIP, young intact male cats are at a higher risk of developing the disease. 9 Clinical signs of the dry form may just be neurological; however, a thorough physical examination, including fundic examination of the eye, is necessary to rule out chorioretinitis or anterior uveitis, intermittent fever and weight loss.",

While MRI of the intracranial form of FIP may demonstrate specific lesions, such as contrast enhancement in the ependyma and meninges, hydrocephalus and/or cerebellar herniation, 58 MRI of the spinal cord for FIP is less specific. Hydrocephalus and/or syringohydromyelia may be detected by CT as well, although MRI will show additional subtle intraparenchymal lesions. 54 Unfortunately, it has been reported that negative feline coronavirus titers in CSF and/or normal MRI findings can be observed in cats with histopathologically confirmed CNS FIP. 58 Despite supportive therapy with steroids and other immunomodulators, no treatments have been proven effective for cats with CNS FIP and the prognosis is poor, with the mortality rate exceeding 95%. 60",
