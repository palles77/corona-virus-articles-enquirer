The epidemiological link was from fruit bats infecting pigs that then served as an amplifier host and infected humans through close contact. Personto-person transmission was rarely documented, and no further human cases have been reported from either country. Detailed analyses of the environmental changes that triggered this outbreak connecting wildlife (bats), livestock (pigs), and humans were reported (Pulliam et al., 2012; Daszak et al., 2013) . This triad of human, animal, and environmental health (One Health) makes Nipah virus outbreaks a prime example of what we have termed the associated pan-epidemic Anthropocene (Lucey et al., 2017) .",

Antibody to Nipah virus was found in 2003 in Pteropus giganteus fruit bats in Haryana State in northern India (Epstein et al., 2008) .

For example, in a 2004 outbreak, 'patient F' transmitted to 22 persons (Gurley et al., 2007) . Most such human-to-human transmission has been linked to close contact, and primarily from a small percentage of infected persons. For example, 62 of 122 persons (51%) with Nipah infection in Bangladesh in 2001-2007 became ill after close contact with another person with Nipah. A possible role for respiratory secretions in transmission has been suggested, because patients with Nipah in Bangladesh have often had pneumonia as well as encephalitis (Hossain et al., 2008) , and viral RNA has frequently been identified in respiratory/oral swabs (Hassan et al., 2018) . Of note, only nine of these 62 persons (7%) from the years 2001-2007 appeared to be responsible for transmitting the virus from person to person (Luby et al., 2009a,b) . The overall case-fatality rate has been estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be approximately 75% (WHO/SEARO, 2001 .",

Notably, human cases have not been reported from outbreaks in the capital city of Dhaka or other major urban areas. Importantly, however, Epstein and colleagues recently reported that Nipah virus RNA in bats exists throughout much of Bangladesh, even beyond the Nipah belt. They noted: \"NiV detection was not restricted to the Nipah belt, suggesting spillover is possible anywhere in Bangladesh if a suitable strain and bathuman interface were present\" (Epstein et al., 2016) . Taken together, it is anticipated that the risk of undetected outbreaks of Nipah in Bangladesh and elsewhere in Asia, due either to infected travelers or transmission from bats to humans with associated person-to-person transmission, should be actively anticipated and actions taken in recognition of this threat.",

Preparations for Nipah outbreaks should be enhanced in order to avoid the unanticipated 'preventable tragedy' of the urban and rural Ebola pan-epidemics in 2014 in West Africa (United Nations Report, 2016) that resulted in over 28 000 persons reported with Ebola virus disease, of whom over 11 000 died. Likely many other deaths occurred during the Ebola pan-epidemics due to the unavailability of what healthcare systems existed before Ebola emerged. In 2013, Luby discussed \"the pandemic potential of Nipah\" (Luby, 2013) . We concur and re-emphasize the call to action in 2018, especially for Nipah epidemics in nations with no prior experience with Nipah, by analogy to West Africa and Ebola in 2013-2016. Similarly, the urban pneumonic plague (UPP) epidemic in Madagascar in 2017, with approximately 2025 persons diagnosed with plague pneumonia (WHO AFRO, 2018), termed afterwards a \"tragic opportunity for improving public health\" (Mead, 2018) , was unanticipated in terms of needed preparedness measures.",

The initial October 2015 publication of the US \"Bipartisan Report of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense\" included a brief scenario of a hypothetical attack in Washington, DC, and in other locations in the USA and abroad that was due to a 'genetically modified' and aerosolized Nipah virus. The zoonotic or 'One Health' nature of human infections with Nipah virus was recognized in this scenario, with animal deaths occurring as well as human fatalities. Notably, of the 34 recommendations from this Blue Ribbon panel, recommendation number 7 was to \"integrate animal health and One Health approaches into biodefense strategies\" (Lieberman and Ridge, 2015) . Similarly, on May 15, 2018 an all-day large simulation exercise called 'Clade X' was carried out and posted online (Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security). The hypothetical pathogen was a bioengineered transmissible hybrid virus with genes from Nipah virus and human parainfluenza virus. Intentional attacks began in Caracas, Venezuela and in Frankfurt, Germany and then spread to over 300 cities via international travel.",

As of May 27, 2018, the recently developed WHO Open online course modules (WHO, 2018b) for many diseases and epidemic-related topics do not include a teaching module for Nipah virus (WHO Open; https:// openwho.org/courses). This gap can readily be closed by collaboration with Nipah experts from Bangladesh, India (especially now from Kerala) and elsewhere. Similarly, the 2018 WHO handbook \"Managing Epidemics\" on 15 deadly diseases does not include Nipah; however, it could readily be added to provide essential clinical and infection prevention and control information (WHO, 2018c) .",
