            "text": "The RNA polymerase of giardiavirus (GLV) is synthesized as a fusion protein through a \u060a1 ribosomal frameshift in a region where gag and pol open reading frames (ORFs) overlap. A heptamer, CCCUUUA, and a potential pseudoknot found in the overlap were predicted to be required for the frameshift. A 68-nucleotide (nt) cDNA fragment containing these elements was inserted between the GLV 5 631-nt cDNA and the out-of-frame luciferase gene that required a \u060a1 frameshift within the 68-nt fragment for expression. Giardia lamblia trophozoites transfected with the transcript of this construct showed a frameshift frequency at 1.7%, coinciding with the polymerase-to-capsid protein ratio in GLV. The heptamer is required for the frameshift but can be replaced with other sequences of the same motif. Mutations placing stop codons in the 0 or \u060a1 frame, located directly before or after the heptamer, implicated the latter as the site for the \u060a1 frameshift. Shortening or destroying the putative stem decreased the frameshift efficiency threefold; the efficiency was fully recovered by mutations to restore the stem. Deleting 18 nt from the 3 end of the 68-nt fragment, which formed the second stem in the putative pseudoknot, had no effect on the frequency of the frameshift. Chemical probing of the RNA secondary structure in the frameshift region showed that bases resistant to chemical modification were clustered in the putative stem structures, thus confirming the presence of the postulated stem-loop, while all the bases in the loop were chemically modified, thus ruling out their capability of forming a pseudoknot. These results confirmed the conclusion based on data from the mutation study that there is but a simple stem-loop downstream from the heptamer. Together, they constitute the structural elements for a \u060a1 ribosomal frameshift in the GLV transcript.",

An efficient \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift is one of such examples of a programmed posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. In response to certain specific structural signals in the mRNA, the ribosomes are induced to slip back 1 nucleotide (nt) at a fixed frequency, move into the \u03ea1 reading frame at a specific site in the mRNA, and continue translating the rest of the mRNA in the \u03ea1 frame (19, 20) .",

This phenomenon of the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift has since been observed among translations of gene transcripts from a large number of viruses (2) , certain Escherichia coli genetic insertion elements (11) , and a conventional cellular dnaX gene from E. coli (35, 36) . The structural motifs in mRNA that are important for an efficient \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift have been characterized in several viral systems primarily by in vitro translation assays (2, 7, 13) . Two structural components have been confirmed to induce such activity. A homopolymeric \"slippery\" heptamer sequence (X XXY YYZ) is required, where XXX can be any three identical nucleotides, YYY can be either AAA or UUU, and Z can be A, U, or C (4, 8, 9) . The second component consists of a stem-loop or a pseudoknot, which is defined as two intertwined stem-loops where a region in the first loop forms base pairs with a downstream sequence to produce a second stem (32) . A pseudoknot is essential for the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift in infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) (3, 5) , human coronavirus (16) , and yeast killer virus (ScV/L-A) (7) . However, among other viruses including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (29) , human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (10), human astrovirus serotype 1 (23) , potato leaf roll virus (30) , and red clover necrotic mosaic virus (21) , a pseudoknot is apparently not essential for the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift. All that is required is a slippery heptamer and a stem-loop located a few nucleotides downstream from it.",

Its 6,277-nt double-stranded RNA genome contains gag and pol-like ORFs that overlap by 220 nt and are separated by a \u03ea1 frameshift (40) . Immunostudies with antipeptide sera targeted to regions in the respective ORFs indicated that the 100-kDa capsid protein is encoded by ORF1. They also showed that the N terminus of the 190-kDa GLV minor protein is encoded by ORF1 while its C terminus has all the consensus sequence motifs of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) family. The 190-kDa protein is therefore most probably a Gag-Pol fusion protein produced by a \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift that is predicted to occur in the 220-nt overlapping region (40) . Within this region, we found a putative slippery heptamer, CCCUUUA, at nt 2836 to 2842 and a downstream stem-loop structure at nt 2848 to 2876 as predicted by MFOLD (25) . A potential second stem could be also formed between the GAUC at nt 2860 to 2863 in the loop and the downstream GAUC at nt 2885 to 2888 (see Fig. 1 ), resulting in a pseudoknot (32) .

Our data derived from corresponding transfectants of the mutant transcripts ( Fig. 2 ) indicate that the first UAA caused a precipitous drop in luciferase expression to 8.6% \u03ee 1.7% of the wild-type frequency of the frameshift or 0.15% of the expression by the in-frame construct pC631(69)luc, while the other four 0 frame stop codons downstream of the heptamer showed luciferase expression at 37.8% \u03ee 8.4%, 52.1% \u03ee 6.0%, 57.3% \u03ee 3.1%, and 72.3% \u03ee 4.0% of the wild-type frameshift frequency ( Fig.  2 ; Table 1 ).

To find if the sequence of this particular heptamer is unique in causing a \u03ea1 translation frameshift in Giardia, we replaced it with a slippery heptamer UUUUUUA identified previously in HIV (19) and an engineered UUUUUUU which showed excellent frameshifting activity in vitro in a previous study (4) . Giardia trophozoites transfected with each of the mutant transcripts indicated that UUUUUA and UUUUUUU led to 131.2% \u03ee 10.7% and 433.9% \u03ee 40.6% of the wild-type frequency of frameshift, respectively, both of which significantly exceeded the effect from the original heptamer in GLV mRNA. Thus, heptamers functioning well in causing \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift in mammalian cells also worked well in Giardia trophozoites. The advantage in retaining a less efficient slippery heptamer in the mRNA by GLV is not entirely clear. One possible explanation is the need for a rigid molar ratio between the RDRP and the capsid protein in the viral particles for stable maintenance of the virus inside Giardia cells, such as that observed in yeast killer virus (9) .

            "text": "on March 20, 2020 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ conforms to the generally accepted structural rule for a slippery heptamer (4, 8, 9) , alteration of individual nucleotides in the heptamer invariably reduces the frequency of the frameshift but never abolishes it. For instance, CCCUAUA led to 60% of the wild-type frameshift frequency whereas UCCUU UA, CCCAUUA, and CCCUUUG led to 78, 85, and 98% of the frameshift frequency, respectively (data not shown). Thus, although some of the heptamers may be more slippery for the ribosome than are the others, depending on the nucleotide sequences, there may not be an absolutely non-slippery heptamer. Initiation of a ribosomal frameshift may be dependent primarily on the presence of a ribosome-blocking secondary structure downstream from the heptamer. A simple stem-loop structure, but not a pseudoknot, constitutes the second structural element for the \u060a1 ribosomal frameshift on GLV mRNA. The heptamer and a putative pseudoknot-like structure were previously identified within the overlapping region between gag and pol ORFs in GLV mRNA ( Fig. 1) (40) . To verify whether the putative second stem formation between the two GAUC tetranucleotides at nt 2860 to 2863 and 2885 to 2888 in the 68-nt region is essential for the frameshift (Fig. 1) , we altered the sequence at nt 2860 to 2863 from GAUC to CUAG to eliminate the possible pseudoknot formation from the transcript. The resulting mutant retained 70.8% \u03ee 2.5% of the wild-type frameshift frequency, suggesting that the putative pseudoknot structure is not essential for the frameshift. To further confirm this conclusion, an 18-nt deletion from the 3\u0408 end of the 68-nt fragment was performed on the encoding cDNA, which also removed the downstream GAUC tetranucleotide involved in the putative pseudoknot formation. The transfectant containing such a mutant mRNA demonstrated 93.8% \u03ee 14.8% of the wild-type frameshift frequency (Table 1) . It is thus clear that neither the pseudoknot structure nor the 3\u0408-end 18 nt of the 68-nt fragment is needed for the occurrence of the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift. The 50-nt fragment from nt 2828 to 2877 in GLV mRNA thus contains both the essential and sufficient structural elements for the frameshift.",

Similarly, a mutation from CGCG (nt 2872 to 2875) at the bottom of the stem to GUGC, resulting in a 4-bp stem 10 nt away from the heptamer, changed the frameshift efficiency to 32.3% \u03ee 4.0% of the wild-type frequency (Fig. 3,  structure 4 ). The length of the stem is thus playing an important role in maintaining the efficiency of frameshift. A decrease from 9 to 5 bp results in a two-third loss of the efficiency. However, a comparison of the results in Fig. 3 indicates that the distance between the stem-loop and the slippery heptamer is of somewhat less importance. There is only a moderate effect on the efficiency of frameshift when it is increased from 5 to 10 nt. Restoration of the stem back to 9 bp through a combination of the two previous mutations resulted in a wild-type frameshift frequency at 102.5% \u03ee 8.8% (Fig. 3, structure 5) . These data demonstrate the important role of the stem-loop structure in causing the frameshift whereas the actual nucleotide sequences in the stem structure are apparently less important. Further, our earlier alteration of the loop sequence at nt 2860 to 2863 from GAUC to CUAG, which resulted in a 70.8% \u03ee 2.5% frameshift efficiency compared to the wild type, suggested a lack of importance of the actual nucleotide sequence of the loop as well.

It has a 6-bp stem and a 14-nt loop located 4 nt downstream from the first stem-loop (Fig. 4) .

In an attempt to verify the actual secondary structures in the 68-nt RNA fragment under native conditions, we made a 4.6-kb T7 RNA polymerase transcript from pC631(68)luc linearized by NruI. We treated this RNA, containing the GLV 5\u0408 631-nt RNA, the 68-nt frameshift region, and the entire coding region of the luciferase, with KE, DMS, or CMCT to modify the unpaired bases that are accessible to alkylation by these agents. KE modifies unpaired G residues at the N-1 position. DMS methylates unpaired A residues at N-1 and, much more weakly, the unpaired C residues at N-3, whereas CMCT modifies the N-3 group of unpaired U residues and the N-1 group of unpaired G residues (12) . The bases thus modified can no longer be recognized by reverse transcriptase in a primer extension reaction, and each can be identified as a reverse transcriptase stop in subsequent gel electrophoresis (27, 33) . A modified base in RNA can be thus readily identified. The oligonucleotide terminating at the modified base moves 1 nt ahead of the corresponding DNA ladder, because primer extension stops immediately before the modified base. Thus, we can expect relatively few stops in stems where the bases are aligned in Watson-Crick pairs and much more stops in loops and unpaired regions free of basebase interaction. The radiolabeled stops often differ in their intensities, presumably due to a partial dissociation among some of the Watson-Crick pairings during the incubation period of chemical probing. The relatively poor efficiency in DMS modification of unpaired C residues also makes unlabeled C's less meaningful in data interpretation.",

When the chemically modified region involving the heptamer and the first putative stem-loop (stem-loop 1) was examined by primer extension (Fig. 5A) , bases in the heptamer and its immediate surrounding areas all showed up as transcriptional stops, suggesting that they were all chemically modified. In the region of loop 1, essentially all of the nucleotides were also modified (Fig. 5A ). This finding, suggesting that all the bases in the heptamer and loop 1 are unpaired, provides the most direct evidence verifying the secondary structure predicted by MFOLD (Fig. 1) . It also rules out the potential involvement of GAUC (nt 2860 to 2863) in loop 1 in forming a pseudoknot as originally postulated in Fig. 1 . Regions predicted to form stem 1 (nt 2848 to 2856 and 2868 to 2876) were found largely free of chemical modification except for G-2854, A-2855, and UUA (nt 2869 to 2871), which all form the weaker G-U or A-U pairs in the postulated stem structure, raising the possibility that these base pairs may become partially dissociated during the chemical probing reactions (24) . G-2850, G-2852, and G-2875 in stem 1 became lightly labeled after prolonged treatment with KE, which could be attributed to partial denaturation of the stem structure on incubation. Taken together, the results lend strong support to our conclusion from the MFOLD program and the mutational analysis of the predicted secondary structure of stem-loop 1.",

The tetranucleotide GAUC (nt 2885 to 2888), which was originally assumed to be a part of the pseudoknot structure ( Fig. 1) , has the G and U residues chemically modified. However, since the first two nucleotides, GA, in the tetranucleotide are actually included in the stem 2 structure and unpaired C is usually poorly modified by DMS, the present results are more consistent with the inclusion of this tetranucleotide in the stem-loop 2 structure rather than in a pseudoknot formation (see Discussion). Overall, data from chemical probing have verified the presence of the artifact stem-loop 2 in the chimeric mRNA transcribed from pC631 (68)luc.",

            "text": "A programmed \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift is adopted by many small RNA viruses to generate viral RNA polymerase (Gag-Pol) as fusion protein with the capsid protein (Gag) at its N terminus and RDRP at the C terminus (reviewed in reference 2). Not only does this strategy ensure that Gag and Gag-Pol proteins are synthesized at a fixed ratio during translation, but on March 20, 2020 by guest http://jvi.asm.org/ also the presence of the Gag domain in the fusion protein provides a recognition signal for the RNA polymerase to be incorporated into the newly assembled virus at a fixed ratio (31) . GLV apparently also uses the same strategy, which has an estimated ratio of about 1 in 60 between the Gag-Pol fusion protein and the Gag protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacylanide gel electophoresis of purified GLV particles (40) , which is in close agreement with the 1.7% frameshift frequency estimated from the present study. Among the viruses that depend on the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift for a well-balanced viral protein synthesis, their transcripts have the common structural elements of the slippery heptamer but differ in the structure of a second requirement. Some viruses, such as IBV (3, 5) and ScV/L-A (7), need the structure of a pseudoknot, while others, such as HIV (29, 43) , require only a simple stem-loop. Our studies showed that the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift in GLV transcript translation also requires a slippery heptamer where the actual frameshift takes place but that only a simple downstream stem-loop, rather than a pseudoknot, is required for inducing the shift. This conclusion has been supported by two original observations from the mutational studies. First, a mutation changing nt 2860 to 2863 in loop 1, the tetranucleotide postulated to be involved in a pseudoknot formation (Fig. 1) , from GAUC to CUAG did not significantly affect the frequency of the frameshift (Table 1 ). This suggests that the tetranucleotide is not involved in forming a pseudoknot that plays an important role in inducing ribosomal frameshift. Second, there is support from the MFOLD identification of stem-loop 2 in the chimeric mRNA (Fig. 4) , which is formed serendipitously by joining the 5\u0408 luciferase sequence with the 3\u0408 end of the 68-nt fragment. This postulated artifact stem-loop can function at 86% of the wild-type efficiency when brought into the proximity of the heptamer by deleting stemloop 1 ( Fig. 4 ; Table 1 ). Since stem-loop 2 contains a loop sequence that cannot form a predicted pseudoknot with the rest of the sequences of the mRNA, a pseudoknot is again ruled out as a requirement for the frameshift. The presence of stem-loops 1 and 2 in the chimeric mRNA was subsequently confirmed by the data from chemical probing and primer extension experiments (Fig. 5) . The extensive chemical modifications of essentially all the bases in the two loop regions also indicate that neither loop forms a pseudoknot with another sequence in the mRNA under the native in vitro conditions. There is thus little doubt that no pseudoknot is present in the region where frameshift takes place and that there is no need of for pseudoknot to cause the frameshift. There could be always some doubt about whether observations made on a chimeric mRNA can fully represent the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift occurring during translation of GLV mRNA in GLV-infected Giardia. The downstream sequences from the region of frameshift differ widely between the chimeric and GLV mRNA. There is no stem-loop 2 structure predicted within this proximal region in GLV mRNA (data not shown). The presence of an extra stem-loop 2 in the chimeric mRNA may amount to a frameshift enhancer element forcing a translating ribosome to pause and the following ribosome to stack behind it at the frameshift signal, resulting in an increased amount of time required for ribosome slipping. This ribosome stacking has been shown to have an effect on programmed \u03ea1 frameshift frequencies (22) . However, we do not think that there is a discrepancy in frameshift frequency between the chimeric and GLV mRNA because of the estimated ratio of 2% between the Gag-Pol fusion protein and the Gag protein in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylanide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified GLV particles (40) , which is quite close to the 1.7% frequency derived from the investigation on chimeric mRNA. The stoichiometry of Gag and Gag-Pol maintained by a 1.7% frameshift frequency also closely agrees with the prediction that in a small icosahedral virion such as GLV, RDRP is expected to be packaged with identical capsid subunits at a ratio of 1:60 (15) .",

This enhancing effect could compensate for the enhancement attributed to the artifact stemloop 2 in the chimeric mRNA that is absent from GLV mRNA. Existing evidence does, however, argue against such a possibility; an extension of the 68-nt fragment to a 215-nt portion of the 220-nt overlapping region between the two ORFs in GLV mRNA failed to alter the frequency of frameshift in the chimeric mRNA transfected Giardia. Formation of a pseudoknot between loop 1 and its immediate downstream viral sequence that could enhance the frameshift is therefore unlikely. Although pseudoknot formation between loop 1 and the sequences further downstream in the viral mRNA is still possible, the probability decreases with increasing distance. We think that our current results obtained from studying the chimeric mRNA in Giardia reflect accurately the \u03ea1 ribosomal frameshift on GLV mRNA during its translation.",

The heptamer CCC UUUA can be replaced with other heptamers, resulting in changed frameshift frequencies in the deceasing order of UUU UUUU, UUUUUUC, and CCCUUUA. A similar order of decreasing frameshift efficiencies was also observed by Brierley et al. in the IBV system (4), suggesting a hierarchy of efficiency that is innate to the sequences of these heptamers regardless of the viruses or the host cells involved.",

In this work, a termination codon placed before the heptamer but in the \u03ea1 frame showed 53.8% of the wild-type frameshift frequency. This was consistent with the results obtained by Honda and Nishimura (17) , where an upstream stop codon in the \u03ea1 frame before the slippery site suppressed the frameshift by about 50%. Three stop codons in the 0 frame downstream from the heptamer also have lower framshift efficiencies, at 52.1, 57.3, and 72.3% of the wild-type efficiency respectively (Fig. 2) . A plausible explanation for the decreased frameshift could be attributed to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (6, 34) , even though it is not yet known whether such a pathway exists in a lineage as ancient as Giardia. The repressive effect also appeared to be decreasing as the stop codons were placed farther away from the heptamer (41) . The stop codon placed at nt 2843 to 2845 in the 0 frame at the immediate 3\u0408 end of the heptamer (Fig. 2) reduced the ribosomal frameshifting to 37.8%. A stop codon placed at the same location in HIV (18) repressed the frameshift by the prokaryote ribosome to a similar extent. Most interestingly, the recoding event was further depressed when the level of the peptide release factors (RF) in vivo was increased, directly linking the decrease in frequency of frameshift with the recruitment of RF by the termination codon (37) . It remains to be determined whether repression of the frameshift is also mediated by RF in our case.",
