These effects are important for productive viral replication since inhibition of desmosterol synthesis has an antiviral effect that can be rescued by the addition of exogenous desmosterol. Here, we use subgenomic replicons to show that desmosterol has a major effect on replication of HCV JFH1 RNA. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments performed with synthetic supported lipid bilayers demonstrate that substitution of desmosterol for cholesterol significantly increases lipid bilayer fluidity, especially in the presence of saturated phospholipids and ceramides. We demonstrate using LC-MS that desmosterol is abundant in the membranes upon which genome replication takes place and that supported lipid bilayers derived from these specialized membranes also exhibit significantly higher fluidity compared to negative control membranes isolated from cells lacking HCV. Together, these data suggest a model in which the fluidity-promoting effects of desmosterol on lipid bilayers play a crucial role in the extensive membrane remodeling that takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum during HCV infection. We anticipate that the supported lipid bilayer system described can provide a useful model system in which to interrogate the effects of lipid structure and composition on the biophysical properties of lipid membranes as well as their function in viral processes such as genome replication.",

These membranes are generally thought to serve as physical barriers that protect the virus from the environment or from host defense mechanisms and/or as platforms that reduce the entropic barrier for viral processes by bringing together the components required for biosynthetic or signaling reactions. Our understanding of these membraneassociated viral processes has relied heavily on the identification and functional characterization of the viral and host proteins associated with these membranes; comparatively less is known about how lipids affect intrinsic membrane properties and membrane function in the viral process. Despite this, numerous transcriptomic and proteomic studies have documented virus-induced changes in the steady-state expression of host lipid biosynthetic, metabolic, and trafficking enzymes; moreover, lipidomic profiling studies have directly demonstrated that viruses cause significant changes in the steady-state abundance of distinct classes of lipids [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] as well as changes to specific lipid molecules within those classes [6] [7] [8] [9] Understanding how these changes relate to the composition and functional properties of subcellular membranes and their associated viral processes thus presents major challenges but also exciting opportunities for investigation.",

Individuals with chronic HCV often exhibit hyperlipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and fatty liver disease, telltale signs that the virus affects steady-state lipid metabolism in the host. While these clinical manifestations of HCV's impact on host lipid metabolism may be by-products with no direct effect on viral replication, the molecular mechanisms underlying these changes have likely evolved because they promote viral replication. An enveloped virus with a positive-strand RNA genome, HCV has been shown to utilize the host lipid metabolism, storage, and trafficking machinery throughout its replication cycle 2, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and to interact with many factors comprising this machinery. In particular, replication of the HCV genome and viral assembly occur within a specialized, membranous environment dubbed the \"membranous web\" (Figure 1 ). While it is well-established that HCV induces formation of the membranous web by altering the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [16] [17] [18] [19] less is known about the lipid composition of this specialized, membranous environment and how this composition affects the viral processes that occur therein.",

Since desmosterol and cholesterol differ only by the presence of a double bond between carbons 24 and 25 (Figure 2A) , this provokes the question of how this subtle structural difference results in the significantly different effects of these sterols on HCV JFH1 replication in cell culture. Here, we show that desmosterol is present in the membranes where replication of the HCV RNA genome occurs and that the antiviral effect observed upon pharmacological inhibition of desmosterol biosynthesis has a significant inhibitory effect on HCV RNA replication. We further report the development of a supported lipid bilayer system and its use to demonstrate that desmosterol increases the fluidity of synthetic bilayers as well as bilayers derived from HCV replication membranes. Collectively, these data suggest a model in which desmosterol directly affects HCV RNA replication by increasing membrane fluidity and facilitating formation of the membranous web.",

Since this subgenomic replicon lacks the region of the genome encoding the HCV structural proteins --core, E1, E2, and p7 -it cannot make new viral particles. Instead, the replicon RNA is synthesized by in vitro transcription and delivered to the cytosol by transfection or electroporation, thus by-passing the normal viral entry process. Firefly luciferase activity predominantly reflects translation of the input RNA at early times postelectroporation (< 8 hours) but at later time points reflects steady-state accumulation of newly synthesized replicon RNA. To ensure that we could resolve effects on translation versus RNA replication, we made use of a replicon bearing mutations in the NS5B gene (\"HCV-NS5B-GND\") that render the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase inactive, thus providing a system in which firefly luciferase activity can unequivocally be taken as a readout of translation of the input replicon RNA.",

Luciferase activities measured at four hours post-electroporation show that translation of the NS5B-GND replicon RNA is slightly affected by depletion of intracellular desmosterol; however, this slight reduction is not rescued by the addition of exogenous desmosterol ( Figure 2B ). These results demonstrate that translation of the replicon RNA is largely unaffected by the presence or absence of desmosterol and that an effect on translation is unlikely to explain to HCV's sensitivity to desmosterol depletion. To confirm this, we performed analogous experiments with the wildtype replicon but quantifying luciferase activities at 72 hours post-electroporation as a measure of steady-state RNA replication. Depletion of intracellular desmosterol using AY9944 causes a significant decrease in RNA replication that is prevented in the presence of exogenously added desmosterol ( Figure 2C ). The correlation of these results using the replicon system with our previous results using live HCVcc provides strong evidence that desmosterol's effect on viral RNA replication is a significant factor in its overall effect on HCV JFH1. Although these results do not preclude the possibility that desmosterol has additional effects on other steps of the HCV life cycle, we focused our efforts on investigating how desmosterol may affect HCV RNA replication.",

Synthesis of the viral RNA occurs in double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) that are often proximal to lipid droplets within the membranous web ( Figure 1 ) 19 . The viral replicase includes all of the viral nonstructural proteins, including the NS3/4A protease, NS3 helicase, NS5B RNAdependent RNA polymerase as well as the NS5A protein, which is required for and localizes at the sites of both HCV genome replication and virion assembly. We used previously established methods 27 to isolate crude HCV replication membranes from Huh7.5 cells stably replicating the HCV JFH1 subgenomic replicon (Huh7.5-SGR) and performed Western blot analysis for the HCV NS3 protein to confirm successful isolation of replicase-containing membranes ( Figure 3A ). Liquid chromatography -mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis of lipidomic samples extracted from these replicase-containing membranes revealed that they have abundant desmosterol whereas desmosterol is significantly reduced in samples isolated from Huh7.5-SGR cells treated with AY9944 ( Figure 3B ) and undetectable in samples from uninfected cells (data not shown). Desmosterol's presence in HCV JFH1-containing membranes demonstrates that it is a component of the membranous web and suggests that it may directly affect HCV RNA replication as well as other viral processes that occur therein rather than influencing HCV via signal transduction or other indirect mechanisms.",

Previous work has demonstrated that cholesterol is significantly better than desmosterol at promoting the formation of lipid-ordered domains in model membranes and inducing or stabilizing detergent-resistant membranes in mammalian cells 28 . While we are unaware of studies that quantitatively compare the effects of desmosterol and cholesterol on membrane fluidity and diffusivity, molecular dynamics simulations predict that desmosterol increases the surface area and fluidity of bilayers and, conversely, decreases order relative to those containing cholesterol and 7-dehydrocholesterol 29, 30 To test this prediction experimentally, we turned to supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) 31, 32 . Since SLBs can be generated from synthetic liposomes, their composition is chemically \"tunable\" and can be modulated to interrogate how lipid composition affects the biophysical and biochemical properties of membranes 33, 34 . In particular, we sought to compare the effects of desmosterol and cholesterol on membrane fluidity using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) 35 to determine diffusion coefficients as a metric of bilayer fluidity for SLBs with precisely controlled lipid content. Performing analogous experiments in cellulo is challenging due to the complexity and lack of planarity of cellular membranes. In addition, the reagents used to modulate lipid abundance in cellulo typically affect multiple species within a given lipid class making it difficult to precisely alter abundance of an individual species. For simplicity, we initially examined SLBs containing only unsaturated phospholipids and sterols and then progressively varied the sterol (desmosterol versus cholesterol), the diversity of lipid headgroups (phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, phosphatidylserines, ceramides), and the saturation of hydrocarbon tails. Since the exact lipid composition of the membranous web and the ER membrane from which it is derived are not well-defined, we chose phospholipid mixtures that mimic the estimated content of the ER 36 .",

This functional difference in bilayer fluidity was even more pronounced when we examined more complex SLBs that included phosphatidylethanolamine and that varied the degree of saturation to better recapitulate the composition of the ER and HCV replicase-containing membranes. In examining a series of SLBs (Table 1) in which unsaturated phospholipids were systematically replaced with a saturated analog, we found that saturated phospholipid tail groups amplify the effects of sterol structure on bilayer formation and mobility. For example, at 5-mol% saturation (DPPS), both cholesterol-and desmosterol-containing SLBs exhibit a uniform fluorescent field after liposome incubation and subsequent washes ( Figure  5A and 5B), indicating formation of a contiguous lipid bilayer. In contrast, when phospholipid saturation is increased to approximately 30% by the replacement of POPE with DPPE, only liposomes that contain desmosterol rupture and form a contiguous lipid bilayer ( Figure 5A and 5B). Lipid diffusion measurements performed on these bilayers ( Figure 5C ) quantitatively demonstrate the effects of phospholipid saturation and sterol structure on membrane fluidity: whereas both desmosterol-or cholesterol-containing SLBs are mobile at 5% lipid saturation, only SLBs containing desmosterol exhibit lipid mobility when saturation of the phospholipid tail groups is increased to 30 and 50%.",

First, the membranous web and double-membrane vesicles wherein HCV RNA replication occurs are derived from the ER, the site of ceramide biosynthesis. Second, the abundance of ceramide species in Huh7 cells increases during HCV infection 1 , and we detected a doubling of ceramide-PI (16:0) levels in our prior lipidomic profiling of HCV JFH1-infected Huh7.5 cells 6 Third, ceramides are known to exert profound effects on lipid packing and order, segregating into regions of highly ordered lipids with decreased membrane fluidity (\"lipid rafts\") 37 . We therefore questioned whether desmosterol restores membrane fluidity of bilayers with increasing concentrations of saturated ceramide. Analysis of a series of SLBs containing POPC (55%) POPE (35%), 5% sterol, and increasing concentrations (5-20%) of saturated C-18 ceramide showed that desmosterol-and cholesterol-containing SLBs exhibit similar diffusion coefficients when ceramide concentration is low (5%), but differ significantly as the concentration of ceramide increases ( Figure 5D ). Whereas bilayer diffusivity decreases significantly with increasing ceramide content for cholesterolcontaining SLB, the desmosterol-containing SLBs maintain diffusivity despite increasing ceramide content. Together, these results demonstrate that desmosterol increases the diffusivity and hence fluidity of lipid bilayers; moreover, this effect appears to be somewhat generalizable since we observe it in bilayers containing unsaturated phospholipids, saturated phospholipids, and ceramides.",

In particular, we sought to correlate the presence of desmosterol in HCV JFH1 replicase-containing membranes with increased bilayer fluidity and diffusivity. Since the complete inventory and stoichiometry of protein components in the HCV replicase are not known, we generated SLBs using HCV replicase-containing membranes isolated from Huh7.5-SGR cells to ensure the presence of the authentic replicase. For this, we built on our prior success using plasma membrane-derived proteoliposomes to generate SLBs containing membrane proteins amenable to characterization in biophysical and enyzmatic assays 38, 39 . Briefly, HCV replicasecontaining membranes were isolated from Huh7.5-SGR cells and negative control membranes were isolated from Huh7.5 cells using the same protocol, as described for Figure  3 . These isolated membranes were used to generate proteoliposomes that were labeled with octadecyl rhodamine (R18), a lipophilic dye, and then deposited onto a hydrophilic glass substrate. Proteoliposome rupture was triggered by the addition of synthetic liposomes, leading to the formation of a proteinaceous, planar SLB. The presence of viral proteins in these SLB was confirmed by immunofluorescence detection of the HCV NS3 and NS5A proteins ( Figure 6A ). Although some staining is apparent in the negative control SLB derived from Huh7.5 cells, this signal is less abundant than for the SLB derived from Huh7.5-SGR cells and is likely due to background staining.",

Specifically, the diffusion coefficient measured for the Huh7.5-SGR SLB was 0.7 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcm 2 /s, seven times greater than that of the Huh7.5 SLB (0.11 \u00b1 0.06 \u03bcm 2 /s). To further determine if the increase in fluidity in Huh7.5-SGR-derived SLBs is due to increased desmosterol, we prepared SLBs from crude replication membranes isolated from cells treated with AY9944 to deplete desmosterol. The diffusion coefficient of desmosteroldepleted replication membranes were calculated to be 0.29 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcm 2 /s, two-fold slower than wild type replication membranes. These data provide strong evidence that increased desmosterol in HCV JFH1 replication membranes contributes to significantly increased bilayer fluidity. Since the exact composition of the biological membranes used to produce these SLBs cannot be known in the absence of untargeted lipidomic analysis, we cannot currently exclude the possibility that other lipid species present in these membranes also modulate bilayer fluidity and thus the fluidity of the SLBs. Despite this caveat, our analysis of replicase-containing and negative control membranes in Figures 3 and 6 demonstrates a striking difference in desmosterol content that is correlated here with a major effect on membrane fluidity ( Figure 6 ).",

These HCV-induced perturbations of desmosterol are functionally important for viral replication since experimental conditions that reduce intracellular desmosterol cause a profound reduction in HCV proteins and RNA that is rescued upon the addition of exogenous desmosterol 6, 11 Importantly, HCV JFH1's interaction with desmosterol appears to be sterol-specific since the intracellular abundance of cholesterol and other late-stage sterols is unaffected by the virus 6 and stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy experiments show that HCV JFH1-induced lipid droplets containing desmosterol are visually distinct from those containing cholesterol 11 . Together, these findings have suggested a model in which HCV JFH1 perturbs desmosterol homeostasis to promote viral replication, likely by affecting a viral process or processes directly. The work presented here builds upon this model by mapping desmosterol's effects to the step of viral RNA replication, and by beginning to investigate the biochemical and biophysical mechanism underlying desmosterol's effect on this viral process.",

Although additional work is needed to understand how desmosterol's enhancement of membrane fluidity promotes viral RNA replication, several non-mutually exclusive possibilities are worth mention. First, desmosterol's presence in both replicase-containing membranes ( Figure 3 ) and HCV-induced lipid droplets 11 , which together comprise the membranous web [16] [17] [18] suggests that the increased fluidity conferred by desmosterol is important for the massive structural rearrangement and reorganization of cellular lipids required to form this specialized, membranous environment for viral genome replication and assembly. Increased membrane fluidity may facilitate membrane curvature and bending. Alternatively, increased lateral diffusivity of the double-membrane vesicles where HCV genome replication occurs may facilitate trafficking of replicase components to this site. A third possibility is that increased membrane fluidity may promote RNA replication by enhancing the structural dynamics needed for efficient catalysis.",

HCV JFH1 is unique among HCV isolates in its relative insensitivity to lipid peroxidation 40, 42 . While the biochemical mechanism(s) that enable HCV JFH1 to overcome the detrimental effects of lipid peroxidation have yet to be defined, one possibility suggested by our data is that the HCV JFH1-induced accumulation of desmosterol in replication membranes reduces the membrane 'stiffening' effect resulting from oxidative stress. Analogous studies performed on cells, replicase-containing membranes, and SLBs isolated from cells bearing subgenomic replicons derived from other HCV strains may help to determine whether desmosterol is critical for HCV's resistance to lipid peroxidation and to test the hypothesis that its effects on membrane fluidity are responsible.",

Experimental models that recapitulate individual viral processes outside of the cell are needed for these efforts since properties like membrane fluidity may have differential effects on viral entry, gene expression, genome replication, and viral assembly/egress. For example, whereas our results correlate desmosterol's enhancement of membrane fluidity with successful RNA replication, Ye and colleagues have shown that increased membrane fluidity has a deleterious effect on HCV fusion during viral entry 42 . Generation of SLBs from replication membranes isolated from HCV SGR and HCV-infected cells allows study of the authentic viral replicase on membranes amenable to a variety of biochemical, biophysical, and imaging methods.

Lipids were thoroughly mixed in a scintillation vial at desired ratios and then the solvent was removed under a stream of high purity nitrogen gas. To ensure all solvent was removed, the vial was placed in a desiccator under vacuum for an additional 2.5 to 3 hours. 4 mL of PBS at pH 7.0 was then added to the dried lipid film and resuspended gently in a benchtop sonicator for twenty minutes on the lowest setting. The final lipid concentration was approximately 2mg/mL. Liposomes underwent two freeze thaw cycles and were then extruded twice through a polycarbonate filter with pore size 100 nm, and thirty times through a filter with a pore size of 50 nm.",

The slides were subsequently rinsed for 30 minutes with copious amounts of deionized water. Clean slides were stored under deionized water, then dried with a stream of ultra pure nitrogen gas prior to use. Integrity of bilayers and diffusion of the lipids within it were examined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). A 0.2 mg/mL solution of liposomes in PBS was incubated in a PDMS well attached to a piranha cleaned slide. Liposomes were allowed to incubate for 20 minutes before being rinsed with PBS at pH 7.0 for one minute. The bilayer was scratched with a dissection tool to remove a thin line of bilayer to aid in focusing on the plane of the bilayer on the microscope. Following the scratching step, the bilayer was rinsed again for one minute with PBS to wash out any lipids removed by scratching. Bilayers were images on a Zeiss Axio Observer.Z1 with a 100x oil objective with a numerical aperture of 1.46. A circular region in the supported lipid bilayer was bleached with a 561 nm solid state laser for 100 ms. The recovery of the intensity of the photobleached spot was recorded for 3 minutes. The fluorescence intensity of the bleached spot was determined after background subtraction and normalization for each image. The recovery data was fit using a Bessel function following the method of Soumpasis 45 . The diffusion coefficient was then calculated using the following equation:",

            "text": "Translation of the HCV genome and processing of the HCV polyprotein occurs on the ER. Genome replication occurs in double-membrane vesicles. Virion assembly is initiated by the association of the viral genomic RNA with core protein on the surface of lipid droplets that are coated with the NS5A protein and that are usually proximal to sites of genome replication. The double-membrane vesicles and lipid droplets where genome replication and assembly, respectively, occur are derived from the ER and together appear as a \"membranous web\" (see electron micrograph inset). Subgenomic replicons derived from the HCV genomic RNA provide useful tools for studying translation and replication of the HCV RNA in the absence of viral entry, virion assembly, and egress. Desmosterol has been detected in replicase-containing membranes by LC-MS analysis ( Figure 2 ) and in NS5Aassociated lipid droplets by stimulated Raman scattering microscopy 11 . 11 . Pharmacological inhibition of DHCR7 leads to depletion of intracellular desmosterol and a profound reduction in both HCV proteins and genomic RNA that is rescued by the addition of exogenous desmosterol. 6 (B and C) Effects of sterols on HCV translation and RNA replication were assessed by electroporation of a polymerase-dead mutant replicon RNA (\"HCV-NS5B-GND\") (B) or wildtype HCV replicon RNA (C) along with a capped renilla luciferase mRNA into Huh7.5 cells pretreated with AY9944 to deplete intracellular desmosterol. (B) Relative translation of the HCV-NS5B-GND replicon RNA was determined by quantification of luciferase activities at 4 hours post-electroporation and normalization of the firefly luciferase signal (RLU Fluc ) using the renilla luciferase (RLU Rluc ) signal to account for differences in electroporation efficiency. (C) Relative replication of the wildtype replicon RNA was assessed by normalizing the RLU Fluc measured at 72 hours post-electroporation to RLU Fluc /RLU RLuc measured at 4 hours post-electroporation to account for differential electroporation efficiencies and decay of the input RNA. Translation of viral RNA is relatively unaffected by the absence of desmosterol, but RNA replication exhibits significant inhibition by AY9944 that is rescued by the addition of exogenous desmosterol. Representative data from an experiment independently performed n \u2265 2 times are shown. Fractional recovery of fluorescence in the photobleached spot plotted as a function of time for SLBs containing desmosterol (grey diamonds) or cholesterol (black circles) shows that membranes containing desmosterol recover at a faster rate after photobleaching. (C) Diffusion coefficients extracted from fitting data in (B) for membranes containing cholesterol (black) or desmosterol (gray) demonstrate slightly increased diffusivity for the desmosterol-containing bilayer. Representative data are shown or n \u22653 independent experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean calculated for 3 replicates, p-value = 0.043. cholesterol (B) . Scratches in images are used to ensure focus is in the correct plane. Liposomes containing cholesterol and 30% saturated lipids do not rupture and appear as punctate fluorescent dots on the glass slide. (C) Diffusion coefficients extracted from FRAP data of SLBs containing increasing lipid tail saturation and desmosterol (grey) or cholesterol (black) show that increasing saturation reduces diffusivity and that desmosterol counteracts this effect by maintaining bilayer fluidity even at high levels of saturation whereas cholesterol does not. (D) Diffusion coefficients derived from FRAP data of SLBs containing increasing concentration of C18 ceramide similarly show that increasing C18 ceramide abundance reduces bilayer diffusivity. Desmosterol-containing SLBs retain bilayer diffusivity whereas cholesterol-containing SLB do not. Representative data are shown or n \u22653 independent experiments. Error bars represent the standard deviation of the man calculated for 3 replicates.",
