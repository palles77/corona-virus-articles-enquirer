Bacillus anthracis is the etiological agent of fatal pulmonary anthrax infections, and the NprR/NprX QS system may be involved in its pathogenesis. NprR, renamed as aqsR for anthrax quorum sensing Regulator, is a transcriptional regulator that may control the expression of genes required for proliferation and survival. Currently, there is no protocol reported to over-express and purify B. anthracis AqsR. In this study, we describe cloning, purification, and confirmation of functional full-length B. anthracis AqsR protein. The AqsR gene was cloned into the pQE-30 vector with an HRV 3C protease recognition site between AqsR and the N-terminal His 6 -tag in order to yield near native AqsR after the His-tag cleavage, leaving only two additional amino acid residues at the N-terminus.",

A typical QS system in Gram-positive bacteria consists of a signaling peptide and a cognate transcriptional regulator. In general, a signaling peptide is produced as a pre-propeptide, which is processed into a propeptide during secretion into extracellular milieu and further cleaved proteolytically to become a mature signaling peptide (Fig. 1) . Either the signaling peptide is sensed, which leads to the activation of a cognate regulator, or it is re-imported into the cell, in which it binds to and activates a cognate regulator [2] . In Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis, signaling molecules are predominantly small peptides whose length ranges from 7 to 22 amino acids [2, 3] .",

Both PapR and NprX are produced as precursor peptides of 48 and 43 amino acids, respectively, and they are predicted to be proteolytically processed into a small mature signaling peptides. PlcR and NprR belong to the family of RNPP (Rap/NprR/PlcR/ PrgX) transcriptional regulators, which are characterized by having multiple tetratricopeptide repeat domains (TPR domains) [5, 6] . The TPR domain is a motif of a degenerate 34 amino acids known to be involved in protein-protein interactions [7] , and its role in the RNPP family regulators appears to be recognition of cognate signaling peptides [5, 6] . The PlcR/PapR system is shown to regulate the expression of several secreted virulence factors that are chromosomally encoded in both B. cereus and B. thuringiensis [8] [9] [10] [11] . However, in B. anthracis, it is non-functional due to the nonsense mutation in the plcR gene [9] . The NprR/NprX system was recently identified and shown to be regulated by the PlcR/PapR system in both B. cereus and B. thuringiensis [12, 13] . Unlike the PlcR/PapR system, the NprR/NprX system appears to be functional in all three bacterial species, B. anthracis, B. cereus, and B. thuringiensis.",

In B. anthracis, the NprR/NprX orthologous system also appears to regulate the expression of the NprA orthologue based on two separate observations. First, NprA has been shown to be part of the secretome of B. anthracis [14, 15] . Second, the disruption of the nprR orthologue resulted in mutants defective in extracellular protease production [16] . The NprR/NprX orthologous system of B. anthracis is predicted to control the expression of a set of genes distinct from those controlled by NprR/NprX of B. cereus and B. thuringiensis. nprR was highly expressed during the outgrowth of B. anthracis spores within murine macrophages [17] , suggesting the NprR/NprX system may be required for survival and/or proliferation of B. anthracis during anthrax pathogenesis. In addition, our unpublished data suggest that the NprR/NprX regulon of B. anthracis is distinct from that of B. cereus. The nprR orthologue is BAS0566 and nprX is unannotated in the genome of B. anthracis Sterne. To recognize the difference mentioned above, we named BAS0566 and its unannotated cognate peptide as aqsR and aqsP for anthrax quorum sensing Regulator and Peptide, respectively.",

First, the His 6 -HRV3C tagged protein was purified from the crude extract by immobilized metal ion affinity column (IMAC) chromatography. Next, the tagged protein was purified from any contaminants by size exclusion chromatography. Finally, the cleaved protein was separated from the His 6 -HRV3C tag by another IMAC chromatography step. AqsR is a hydrophobic protein, so a higher concentration of Triton X-100 and a higher volume (20 mL/g cell pellet) was used in the lysis buffer to increase the solubility. After cell lysis by sonication, the protein is reasonably soluble as shown in lanes 2 and 3 ( Fig. 3B) with the clarified extract (lane 3) retaining similar amounts of the target protein as the crude extract (lane 2). The first IMAC chromatography step used a step gradient of elution buffer to isolate His 6 -HRV3C tagged AqsR from the other E. coli soluble cellular components. At a 40% concentration of elution buffer, or approximately 300 mM imidazole, His 6 -HRV3C-AqsR was eluted as determined by the distinct peak in the UV 280 absorbance measurement on the chromatograph. The corresponding 3-mL fractions were collected, and a portion of each fraction was run on SDS-PAGE gel to confirm the presence of expressed protein (lane 5 in Fig. 3B ). Table 1 shows the resulting yield and purity of a typical AqsR purification. In order to determine the protein concentration at the various stages of purification, the UV absorbance at 280 nm was measured. The yield after the first IMAC step is ~83% (Table 1) compared to the clarified extract. The lowered percent yield can be due to the high level of impurities that interfere with the protein measurements in the clarified extract, leading to a false sense of significant protein loss. Actual loss of protein is most likely due to a lowered binding affinity of the protein to the Ni-IMAC column, resulting in the protein being washed out. This is confirmed by the presence of the protein in the flow-through during the unbound wash step (lane 4 in Fig. 3B ). Despite the loss in the flow-through, however, the SDS-PAGE shows high retention of the purified protein (lane 5 in Fig. 3B ). To remove any additional impurities and provide preliminary structural information, the purified His 6 -HRV3C tagged AqsR was subjected to size exclusion chromatography equipped with the HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 PG gel filtration column. The His 6 -HRV3C-AqsR (lane 6 in Fig. 3B ) eluted at a volume corresponding to ~45-50 kDa, indicating it may exist as a monomer. (Fig. 4A) It is important to note that although the molecular weight of the His 6 -HRV3C tagged AqsR is approximately 52 kDa, the protein band is apparent at approximately 44 kDa in the gel (Figs. 3 and 4B) . A follow-up confirmation with Mass Spectrometry is described below.",

Although functions/activities of some proteins are not affected by the presence of a tag and/or by the tag size [19] , others, do show complete/partial loss of their activities even with a tag consisting of a few residues [20] . Therefore, to avoid any potential complication for downstream studies with the purified AqsR, we tried to prepare as-native-as-possible AqsR. His 6 -HRV3C tag cleavage was performed using HRV 3C protease, and removed by reloading the protease-treated sample into the Ni-IMAC column as follows. The collected fraction from size excluded AqsR was pooled and incubated with 1.5 units of HRV 3C protease per mg of protein. For maximal cleavage, the solution was dialyzed in dialysis buffer for 16 hours at 4 \u00b0C. Native AqsR was isolated from the cleaved His 6 -HRV3C tag by injecting the dialyzed sample into the Ni-IMAC column pre-equilibrated with binding buffer without imidazole. Only the His 6 -HRV3C tag and the HRV 3C protease, which is also a His-tag fusion, will bind to the Ni-IMAC column. As a result of tag removal, native AqsR will not be able to bind to the Ni column and will be collected in the flow through. The presence of cleaved AqsR was confirmed with SDS-PAGE gel (lane 7 in Fig. 3B ), and the final yield was ~58% compared to the clarified extract (Table 1) at over 95% purity.",

AqsR should be slightly above the 49 kDa protein marker in the SDS-PAGE gel, but it was shown below that marker closer to a 44 kDa area. This could indicate three very different possibilities. First, the purified protein is not AqsR, but some other E. coli protein that is 44 kDa in size. Second, the purified AqsR was truncated by an E. coli protease and became smaller. Fig. 5A illustrates where a truncation could have occurred in order to produce ~44 kDa AqsR. If this is the case, about 51 amino acid residues at the C-terminus would not be identified by Mass Spectrometry. Third, it is the correct AqsR of 50.3 kDa, but its migration is slightly faster than what it is supposed to be, causing it to show up as a smaller protein in the SDS-PAGE gel.",

While protein identification by mass spectrometry can clearly indicate whether the purified protein is AqsR or not, it can also reveal if the purified AqsR is truncated. Truncation can only happen at the C-terminus because IMAC purification was done by capturing N-terminal His-tags, and hence the N-terminus was intact. Gel slices were treated with trypsin to generate small peptides before being subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. Identified peptides were searched in the E. coli protein database with the addition of the B. anthracis AqsR protein sequence. Search results clearly indicated that our purified protein was indeed B. anthracis AqsR with > 80% coverage of total AqsR protein sequence (Fig. 5B) . Identified peptides are shown in pink squares in Fig. 5B . As can be seen, more than 130 amino acid residues at the C-terminus are present in the purified AqsR, clearly indicating the purified protein is the full-length AqsR. All identified peptide sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1 ). Therefore, we concluded that despite the apparent smaller size on the SDS-PAGE gel, the purified protein is the full-length AqsR.",

Previously, a heptapeptide (SKPDIVG), NprX7, was determined to bind to NprR at an estimated binding affinity (K D ) of 50 nM in B. thuringiensis [21] . Hence, the same heptapeptide orthologue in B. anthracis, AqsP7 (SKPDIVG), was tested with AqsR using the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique for K D determination. Peptide concentrations ranging from 1.95 nM to 250 nM were passed through immobilized AqsR, and real time response units at each concentration were monitored. The 1 to 1 Steady-State Affinity model was used to analyze the data, and the resulting K D was 57.3 nM, which is similar to that of NprR/NprX7 (Fig. 6) . A shorter peptide, AqsP5 (SKPDI), was also investigated in the same manner, and its K D was 2161 nM, ~38-fold weaker than that of AqsP7 (data not shown), indicating that at least seven residues might be required for signaling in B. anthracis, as was the case for B. thuringiensis [21] . Therefore, our purified full-length AqsR was able to recognize its signaling peptide AqsP7 at a comparable binding affinity to the NprR/NprX7 interaction, suggesting that it is functional.
