            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an emerging pathogenic coronavirus that causes a significant economic burden to the swine industry. The virus infects the intestinal epithelium and causes villous atrophy, resulting in diarrhea and dehydration. Interaction of the viral spike (S) surface glycoprotein \u2212 through its S1 subunit \u2212 with the host cell receptor is the first step in infection and the main determinant for virus tropism. As for several other alphacoronaviruses including the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), the aminopeptidase N (APN) protein was reported to be a functional receptor for PEDV. In this study we examined the role of APN as a receptor. We show that overexpression of porcine APN renders MDCK cells susceptible to TGEV, but not to PEDV. Consistently, unlike TGEV-S1, PEDV-S1 exhibited no binding to cell-surface expressed APN or to a soluble version of APN. Moreover, preincubation of these viruses with soluble APN or pretreatment of APN expressing ST cells with soluble TGEV-S1 blocked TGEV infection, but had no effect on infection by PEDV. The combined observations indicated that APN is not required for PEDV infection. To definitively prove this conclusion, we applied CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering to knock out APN expression in PEDV-susceptible porcine (ST) and human cell lines (Huh7 and HeLa). As a consequence these cells no longer bound TGEV-S1 and HCoV-229E-S1 at their surface and were resistant to infection by the corresponding viruses. However, genetic ablation of APN expression had no effect on their infectability by PEDV, demonstrating that APN is not essential for PEDV cell entry.",

PEDV replicates efficiently in the small intestine and causes acute, severe atrophic enteritis inducing watery diarrhea, dehydration and vomiting, with particularly high mortality in sero-negative neonatal piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980) . PEDV was first reported in feeder and grower pigs in England in 1971 (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978) . Subsequently, PEDV positive cases were reported in several other European countries. In Asia, PEDV was first identified in 1982, after which it remained endemic causing substantial economic losses to the pork industry (Song and Park, 2012) . Since 2010, a large-scale outbreak of PEDV was reported in China. The severe outbreak was characterized by 80-100% morbidity and 50-90% mortality among infected suckling piglets Sun et al., 2012) . Apart from some suspected cases in Canada in 1970s (Turgeon et al., 1980) , North America was free of PEDV until April 2013, when a severe outbreak started which spread rapidly across the United States, causing high mortalities among infected piglets and substantial economic losses (Chen et al., 2014; Cima, 2013; Huang et al., 2013) .",

Receptor interaction of coronaviruses is mediated by the trimeric spike (S) glycoproteins that form the characteristic, large spikes on the coronaviral envelope (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . Coronaviruses use a variety of cellular proteins as functional receptors for cell entry. The porcine alphacoronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), which is clinically indistinguishable from PEDV, utilizes aminopeptidase N (APN) as its receptor (Delmas et al., 1992) , similar to other alphacoronaviruses including the human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (Yeager et al., 1992) , the feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and the canine coronavirus (CCV) (Tresnan et al., 1996) . An exception within the alphacoronavirus genus is the human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) which employs angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The ACE2 receptor was earlier identified as a functional receptor for the betacoronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Li et al., 2003) . The betacoronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) mediate infection by binding to carcinoembryonic antigen-cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM1) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) (Raj et al., 2013; Williams et al., 1991) , respectively. Some coronaviruses, including human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) use acetylated sialic acids as functional receptors (Schultze et al., 1991; Vlasak et al., 1988) .",

APN is a 150 kDa glycosylated type II transmembrane protein that is highly abundant on the apical membrane of mature enterocytes. It was termed \"moonlighting enzyme\" referring to its multiple biological functions, including peptide metabolism, cell motility and adhesion (Mina-Osorio, 2008) . In pigs, porcine APN (pAPN) is abundantly expressed on the brush border membrane of the intestine; additionally, it is also expressed on the surfaces of epithelial cells of kidneys and respiratory tract (Cong et al., 2015) . Several lines of evidence support the view that APN is a functional receptor for PEDV. i) A \u223c150 kDa PEDV-binding protein was identified in swine testis (ST) cells by virus overlay protein binding assay (VOPBA), the interaction with which could be blocked by antibodies against pAPN (Oh et al., 2003) . ii) pAPN overexpression in non-or poorly susceptible cell lines (i.c. Madin Darby canine kidney and ST cell) conferred susceptibility of these cells to PEDV infection (Nam and Lee, 2010) . iii) Preincubation of cells with either pAPN antibodies or pAPN binding peptides prior to inoculation with PEDV interfered with infection (Li et al., 2007) . iv) PEDV S1 was found to biochemically interact with soluble APN in a dot-blot assay and with cell surface expressed APN in a FACS assay (Deng et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015) . v) Transgenic mice expressing pAPN were rendered susceptible to PEDV infection (Park et al., 2015) . Despite these findings, PEDV efficiently infects African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells (Hofmann and Wyler, 1988; Kusanagi et al., 1992) , known not to express APN (Li et al., 2007; Shirato et al., 2011) , questioning the role of pAPN as a functional receptor.",

TGEV S1 \u2212 but not PEDV S1-can bind to porcine APN To further check whether PEDV could biochemically interact with pAPN, we expressed and purified the S1 protein of PEDV and TGEV, both C-terminally tagged with the Fc-portion of human (Fc) or mouse (mFc) IgG for affinity purification and detection. S1-Fc binding to MDCK-pAPN and MDCK cells was analysed by flow cytometry. Binding of TGEV-S1-Fc was seen to the surface of MDCK-pAPN cells but not to that of parental MDCK cells. In contrast, overexpression of pAPN did not confer binding of PEDV-S1-Fc to MDCK cells (Fig. 2a) . A similar binding pattern was seen upon pAPN overexpression in HEK293T cells (data no shown). Furthermore, using a dot blot hybridization assay as described by Peng et al. (Peng et al., 2011) , we demonstrated binding of MERS-CoV-S1-mFc and TGEV-S1-mFc to their human Fc-tagged human DPP4 or porcine APN receptor, respectively (Delmas et al., 1992; Raj et al., 2013) , whereas binding of the S1 of various PEDV strains to pAPN could not be detected (Fig. 2b) . . We tested whether PEDV infection on these porcine cells is compromised by preincubation with soluble pAPN (i.c. its non-membrane anchored form). PEDV was pre-incubated with Fctagged pAPN ectodomain (pAPN-Fc) at different concentrations, prior to inoculation. TGEV was taken along as a positive control. Soluble pAPN significantly inhibited infection of TGEV in a dose-dependent manner, whereas it failed to neutralize PEDV infection ( Fig. 3a and 3b) . It cannot be excluded that lack of inhibition by soluble APN is due to low affinity binding of PEDV S1 to pAPN. Hence we used TGEV S1 that displays high affinity pAPN binding to saturate TGEV binding sites on pAPN on the surface of ST cells, and assessed the effect on PEDV and TGEV infection. ST cells were preincubated with indicated concentration of TGEV-S1-mFc and subsequently infected with TGEV and PEDV ( Fig. 3c and 3d) . As expected, preincubation of cells with TGEV-S1-mFc could significantly inhibit TGEV infection in a dose dependent manner, blocking approximately 70% of TGEV infection at 200 \u03bcg/ml (Fig. 3d) . However, PEDV infection was not affected by pretreatment of cells with TGEV-S1-mFc (Fig. 3c) . The latter data suggest that PEDV and TGEV do not share the same receptor, or that they recognize different parts on the pAPN receptor.",

The identity of the mutant cell line was confirmed by sequencing. The ST \u0394APN cell line harbors a 2 nucleotide out-of-frame deletion in exon 1 (Fig. 4a) , resulting in the production of a 32 amino acid short truncated peptide that lacks \"virusbinding motifs\" of TGEV . Surface staining with the pAPN-dependent TGEV S1 was used to functionally assess APN knockout in the ST \u0394APN cells. The HCoV-229E S1-Fc that can bind to human but not porcine APN was taken along as a negative control. Compared to parental ST cells, the ST \u0394APN cells lost their ability to bind TGEV-S1-Fc (Fig. 4b) . Moreover, TGEV could only infect ST cells and not ST \u0394APN cells, confirming the knockout of pAPN expression in ST \u0394APN cells ( Fig. 4c and d) . We subsequently used different PEDV strains to infect ST and ST \u0394APN cells. No significant difference in PEDV infection was found (Fig. 4c and d) , demonstrating that knockout of APN expression in ST cells does not block PEDV infection. ",

Human cervix cells HeLa cells can support PEDV infection, but seem to lack APN expression (Bausch-Fluck et al., 2015) . HeLa cells do not support infection of the APN-dependent HCoV-229E, consistent with the lack of detectable APN expression in these cells. Moreover, genetic ablation of the APN gene in HeLa cells by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing did not affect PEDV infection suggesting that human APN is not necessary in PEDV infection of HeLa cells (data not shown). Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line Huh7 cells express human APN and are susceptible to PEDV and HCoV-229E (Tang et al., 2005) . To check the APN dependency of PEDV infection in Huh7 cells, we created mutant Huh7 cells (Huh7 \u0394APN ) in which the APN gene was disrupted by CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. Sequence analysis of the APN gene in the Huh7 \u0394APN cell line indicated the occurrence of a 577 nucleotide out-of-frame deletion in exon 1 (Fig. 5a) . The loss of APN expression was confirmed by western blotting (data not shown) and the lack of HCoV-229E-S1 staining (Fig. 5b) , as well as by the lack of HCoV-229E infection (Fig. 5c) . However, the APN gene knockout in Huh7 cells did not prevent infection of different strains of PEDV (Fig. 5c) . Moreover, PEDV DR13 did display similar growth kinetics and reached similar titers on Huh7 and Huh7 \u0394APN (Fig. 5d) . Altogether, these results convincingly demonstrate that APN is not required for PEDV infection of porcine and human cells.",

However, pAPN overexpression in otherwise nonsusceptible, receptor-negative cells was never found to robustly support virus infection (Li et al., 2007) . In addition, African green monkey kidney (Vero) cells, which were historically used for PEDV isolation and propagation, do not express APN as inferred from mass spectrometry analyses of the Vero cell proteome, immunofluorescent staining (Guo et al., 2014; Li et al., 2007; Shirato et al., 2011; Zeng et al., 2015) and RT-PCR analysis (own observation). During our study to assess the role Fig. 2 . PEDV S1 does not bind porcine APN.(a) Binding of S1-Fc protein of different PEDV strains to the cell surface of MDCK-pAPN (black line) and MDCK cells (grey shading) was measured by flow cytometry. The porcine APN-binding TGEV-S1-Fc was used as positive control. (b) Dot blot hybridization assay was used to detect binding of Fc-tagged S1 proteins of different PEDV strains to porcine APN (pAPN) spotted on nitrocellulose membrane. The human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4) was also spotted. The pAPN-binding TGEV-S1-Fc and hDPP4-binding MERS-CoV S1-Fc were taken along as positive controls. S1 proteins were C-terminally tagged with the Fc part of murine IgG1 and pAPN or hDPP4 were tagged with a Cterminal human IgG1 Fc. Binding of S1-Fc proteins to pAPN or hDPP4 was detected using antibodies against the murine Fc tag. of APN in PEDV entry, we established that overexpression of porcine APN in non-susceptible cells did not confer susceptibility to PEDV. No interaction of PEDV S1 to pAPN was found using biochemical and FACS-based assays. The recently established CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system was used to study APN function during PEDV entry. It demonstrated that genetic ablation of APN in porcine or human cells susceptible to PEDV did not abrogate PEDV infection. In all these experiments we used multiple PEDV strains to exclude strain-specific artifacts in receptor usage and we exploited TGEV and HCoV-229E as a well-established control for APN receptor usage. From our combined results we therefore conclude that APN is not required as a functional receptor for PEDV entry.",

It was largely based on similar approaches as ours except for the APN knock out experiments we performed to demonstrate that APN is not essential for PEDV entry. The authors demonstrated that overexpression of pAPN did not render cells susceptible to PEDV and showed that PEDV was unable to bind pAPN and could not be neutralized by treatment with soluble pAPN. These results are similar to our observations, but contrary to that of others (Cong et al., 2015; Deng et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015; Nam and Lee, 2010) . Interestingly, Shirato et al. also showed that overexpression of pAPN in porcine CPK cells facilitated PEDV entry and, moreover, that the enhancement was contributed by an enzymatic activity of APN (Shirato et al., 2016) . This observation might explain the earlier reports that overexpression of pAPN in cells exerted positive effects on infection by PEDV (Cong et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015; Nam and Lee, 2010) .",

            "text": "With the exclusion of porcine APN as a functional receptor for PEDV, the actual main virus receptor still awaits its identification. Cell surface carbohydrates including heparan sulphate proteoglycans have been reported as an attachment factor for PEDV (Huan et al., 2015) . In addition, sialoglycoconjugates exposed on cell surfaces can function as auxiliary receptors, though their usage varies among PEDV strains (Deng et al., 2016; Li et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015) . Intriguingly, PEDV can infect cells of many species, including those of pigs, monkeys, cats (Truong et al., 2013) , ducks (Khatri, 2015) , bats and humans (Xu et al., 2016) . The broad cell species tropism of PEDV indicates that the virus binds a host cell surface molecule that is evolutionarily conserved among mammalian species. The numbers below the protein sequence indicate the amino acid position. (b) FACS analyses of HCoV-229E-S1-Fc binding to Huh7 and Huh7 \u0394APN cells. TGEV-S1-Fc \u2212 incapable of binding to human APN \u2212 was used as a negative control. (c) PEDV (strains GDU and UU) and HCoV-229E infection on Huh7 and Huh7 \u0394APN cell line. Infected cells were visualized by immunofluorescence staining using anti-PEDV and anti-HCoV-229E antibodies and nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). Infection experiments were repeated twice, and representative images are shown. (d) Growth kinetics of PEDV (strain DR13) on Huh7 and Huh7 \u0394APN cells (MOI 0.01). Huh7 and Huh7 \u0394APN cells were infected with PEDV DR13 (MOI = 0.01), washed after three hours and viral infectivity in the culture media was determined at different times p.i. by a quantal assay on Vero cells from which TCID50 (50% tissue culture infective dose) values were calculated.",
