Associated Cell Sorting (FACS) verified that MEFs proliferated over the acute heat shock and 109! also following recovery, and they did not undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis ( Figure S1A ). For 110! accurate normalization of PRO-seq data, we used whole-genome spike-in from Drosophila S2 111! cells ( Figure S1B , see Materials and Methods for details), and pooled biological replicates for 112! data analyses after validating their high correlation ( Figure S1C ). As previously reported (Mahat 113! et al., 2016; , a single heat shock caused a robust induction of hundreds 114! and repression of thousands of genes, simultaneously accumulating Pol II at divergently 115! transcribed distal Transcription Regulatory Elements (dTREs), hereon called enhancers (Figure 116! 1A). During a 4-hour recovery, the genome-wide profile of gene and enhancer transcription was 117! precisely restored to the level observed prior to the heat shock ( Figure 1A -B), which demarcates 118! high plasticity and accurate recovery of the transcription program. Despite the full recovery of 119! gene body transcription, certain promoter-proximal regions gained new pause sites, as 120! exemplified by Heat Shock Protein H1 (Hsph1 alias Hsp110) gene ( Figure 1B ). Moreover, a 121! subset of heat-responsive genes either gained ( Figure S1D ) or retained ( Figure S1E ) high Pol II 122! density at a single pause site during the recovery. Consequently, the genome-wide average of Pol 123! II at the pause region remained elevated, even when measured in the daughter cells, 48 hours 124! after the heat exposure ( Figure 1C ). 125!",

To examine the status of Pol II and 316! processing of transcripts at 5'-and 3'-ends of genes, we analyzed the length distribution of PRO-317! seq reads that overlap either with the transcription start site (TSS) or CPS. In essence, Pol II that 318! undergoes initiation or pausing has transcribed through fewer nucleotides (<60 nt) than the 319! sequenced read length in our PRO-seq data (75 nt).

An important consequence of repressing thousands of genes by preventing the 364! release of Pol II from their promoter-proximal regions is its rapid reversibility; a simple re-365! activation of the pause-release can restore productive gene transcription genome-wide without 366! extensive chromatin remodeling. In this regard, Pol II pausing can be considered as one form of a 367! which is unlikely to cause permanent or long-lasting damage to the cell, did not change the basal 386! transcription, but it increased Pol II pausing ( Figure 1 ). Moreover, a single heat shock accelerated 387! heat-induced transcription in the daughter cells by allowing more efficient progression of Pol II 388! through the pause-region (Figure 2 ). This faster responsiveness without a change in the basal 389! transcription mechanistically explains how cells can retain a memory of previously encountered 390! stress to prepare their daughter cells for protection against proteotoxicity (Figure 7) . 391!",

In accordance, human K562 394! erythroleukemia cells proliferated through multiple heat shocks that challenge the proteome 395! integrity ( Figure S3 ). The persistence of protein-damaging stress in the daughters of repeatedly 396! stressed K562 cells was reflected in their transcriptional profile; two mitotic divisions after nine 397! heat exposures, transcription of certain pro-survival genes was elevated, whereas expression of 398! genes that are involved in maintaining protein production was decreased (Figure 3 ). The declined 399! synthesis of protein production machinery was accompanied with reduced processing of 400! transcripts at the 3'-ends of active genes ( Figure 6 ). In cells with decreased protein synthesis, the 401! decelerated transcription termination likely serves to reduce the mRNA load, as less pre-mRNA 402! is released from the chromatin, and fewer Pol II molecules become available for new rounds of 403! heat-induced transcription (Figure 7) . Moreover, increased association of uncleaved transcripts at 404! the 3'-ends of genes could provide a reservoir of pre-mRNAs that are rapidly processed to mature 405! mRNAs once proteotoxicity is relieved and the cell restores its protein synthesis. This regulatory 406! step at the 3'-end of the gene would be particularly important to instantly restore production of 407! ! ! 16! mRNAs from long genes, where transcription, proceeding on average 2.5 kb/minute (Jonkers et 408! al., 2014) , can take hours to complete after the Pol II pause-release.

RNA synthesis and expression of mature mRNAs (Figure 4A;Figure S4A). Strikingly, HSF1-246! binding to the promoters of HSPA1A and HSPH1 was similar in unconditioned and 247! preconditioned cells (Figure 4A;Figure S4A), indicating uncompromised capacity of HSF1 to 248! bind to its target regulatory elements. In contrast, RNA synthesis of HSPA1A and HSPH1 was 249! blunted, and the levels of their corresponding mature mRNAs were lower in preconditioned cells 250! (Figure 4A;Figure S4A). These results demonstrated that mechanisms beyond HSF1 binding 251!caused reduced expression of heat-responsive genes in preconditioned cells. PRO-seq profiles of 252! nascent transcription suggested compromised Pol II progression to underlie the lower RNA 253! expression of heat-induced genes. Reduced Pol II density at the promoter-proximal regions was 254! accompanied with a locally confined increase in engaged Pol II downstream of the CPS, and this 255! pattern of Pol II progression was detected at HSPH1 (Figure 4B), as well as along highly heat-Dependent eRNA Transcription Is Diminished in Preconditioned K562 Cells 259! To quantify HSF1-dependent gene and enhancer transcription genome-wide, we tracked nascent 260! transcription in HSF1-depleted K562 cells (Figure 5A). In total, 227 genes and 496 enhancers 261! were HSF1-dependently heat-induced both in unconditioned and preconditioned cells (Figure 262! S4B). This data demonstrates that HSF1 trans-activates both genes and enhancers, and that it is 263! indispensable for the heat-induced regulatory element activation regardless of the preconditioning 264! (Figure 5B-E;Figure S4B-C). The ability of HSF1 to trans-activate genes from enhancers was 265! evident for genes such as Tax1 Binding Protein 1 (TAX1BP1). At this locus, HSF1 only bound to 266! a divergently transcribed enhancer 4.5 kb upstream of the promoter (Figure 5C-D).

Enhancers are also regulated at the step of Pol II pause-273! release(Henriques et al., 2018), but this pause is short-lived and we have not detected Pol II 274! pausing to prime enhancers for heat activation. Instead, the predominant 275! function of HSF1 in activating eRNA transcription appeared to involve the recruitment of Pol II.276!First, eRNA synthesis was minute along the whole length of HSF1-dependent enhancers in the 277! absence of HSF1 (Figure 5B). Second, Pol II did not accumulate at enhancer pause regions in 278! HSF1-knockdown cells (Figure 5B-C,E;Figure S4D), which would be expected if HSF1 279! primarily released the pause at enhancers. The HSF1-assisted Pol II recruitment could be indirect, 280! mediated for example by chromatin modifications that follow HSF1-binding(Zobeck et al.,  281!   2010;Petesch and Lis, 2012;Kusch et al., 2014; reviewed in Vihervaara and Sistonen, 2014).",

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/576959 doi: bioRxiv preprint Supplementary Figure 5 (related to Figures 5 and 6) . Genome-wide distribution of engaged Pol II molecules changes by preconditioning. A) Schematic representation of genomic regions within which the distribution of engaged Pol II molecules was measured. The numbers below each region indicate the percentage of all uniquely mapping PRO-seq reads that localize to the given region in unconditioned K562 cells. NHS: non-heat shock; 30 min and 60 min indicate the time of heat shock at 42\u00b0C. B) Percentage of all uniquely mapping PRO-seq reads at the indicated regions of heat-induced (left panel) and heat-repressed (right panel) genes and enhancers. Orange dashed circles indicate genomic regions with increased total engagement of Pol II in preconditioned cells. Gray dashed circles indicate regions with reduced Pol II engagement in preconditioned cells. The colored triangles above the bars denote the time of the heat shock. C) Transcription profile of heat-induced co-chaperone DNAJB1 and heatrepressed splicing factor (SFPQ) genes. Dashed circles indicate regions with reduced, and squares with increased, Pol II engagement in heat-shocked preconditioned cells as compared to heat-shocked unconditioned cells..
