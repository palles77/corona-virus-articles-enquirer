M. suis glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-like protein 1 (MSG1), a membraneassociated adhesion protein, plays a major role in M. suis attachment and infection of porcine erythrocytes. In order to identify the epitopes in MSG1 protein of M. suis, recombinant MSG1 (rMSG1) expressed in Escherichia coli Top10 was purified with affinity chromatography and used to immunize BALB/c mice to prepare and screen monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Western blot results showed that 1C10, 2F10, 4G10, and 10E9 can specifically react with recombinant MSG1 and M. suis. Moreover, 23 truncated fragments of MSG1 were amplified and cloned into pET-32a vector and induced by IPTG. Different recombinant truncated proteins were used to identify B cell epitopes in the rMSG1 protein. Epitope mapping revealed that MAb 1C10 recognizes the linear epitope D 291 THGSVF 297 ; MAb 2F10 recognizes the linear epitope L 251 CLKI 255 ; and MAbs 4G10 and 10E9 recognize the linear epitope I 268 KDGENE 274 . The alignment of MSG1 epitope sequences with that of different M. suis strains accessed on NCBI showed that one epitope is highly conserved in M. suis strains. This research is the first to examine the epitopes in MSG1 of M. suis and demonstrate the variations of epitopes.",

(1) This bacterium mainly infects pigs and is responsible for a disease referred to as infectious anemia. (2) Acute clinical porcine infectious anemia can cause hemolytic anemia and death in young piglets, sows' pre-partum or at weaning, and feeder pigs under stress. (3) In addition, chronic infection is associated with reproductive inefficiency in sows and an increased incidence of respiratory and enteric disease and reduced body weight gain in feeder pigs. (3, 4) M. suis can also infect humans, although people infected by M. suis are symptomless. (5, 6) Adherence of M. suis to the surface of porcine erythrocytes is important to its pathogenicity. (7) Eight M. suis-specific antigens have previously been identified by immunoblot analysis. (8) Among these antigens, M. suis glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase-like protein 1 (MSG1), which is similar to bacterial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (GAPDHs), was identified as the most important adhesion protein of M. suis. The similarity of MSG1 with GAPDHs from other pathogenic mycoplasmas ranged from 52.6% to 54.5% at the amino acid sequence level. (9) In addition, vaccination with recombinant MSG1 protein (rMSG1) elicited strong immune responses in pigs (10) ; however, little is known about the antigenic epitopes present in this protein.",

Briefly, splenectomized pig was infected with M. suis and confirmed by microscopic examination of peripheral blood smears stained with acridine orange and PCR for 16S rRNA. When the pig was in bacteremia, blood was collected from the vena cava anterior and diluted at a 1:1 ratio with aseptic Alsever's solution (111 mM glucose, 27.2 mM sodium citrate, 71.8 mM sodium chloride, pH 6.1). Blood cells were sedimented by low-speed centrifugation at 300 g for 15 min at room temperature and plasma and buffy coat were discarded. The pellet consisting of M. suis-laden erythrocytes was suspended in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 56\u00b0C for 10 min. M. suis cells in the supernatant were sedimented by high-speed centrifugation at 25,000 g for 120 min at 4*8\u00b0C. The resulting pellet of M. suis was re-suspended in sterile 0.15 M NaCl and stored at -20\u00b0C until use. Blood sample from the non-infected pig was processed in the same manner as negative control. Escherichia coli strains Top10 and Ro-setta2, pET-32a( + ), and Ni-NTA agarose were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The recombinant plasmid, pBAD-msg1 was previously constructed by our laboratory. (12) Mouse myeloma cells (SP2/0) cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Female BALB/c mice, 4-6 weeks of age, were purchased from the Laboratory Animal Centre of Nantong University (Nantong, China). Animal experiments were approved by the The recombinant plasmid pBAD-msg1 was transformed into Top10 cells (E.coli/pBAD-msg1) and induced by arabinose as previously described.

Final protein concentrations were determined by NANODROP2000 spectrophotometry (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA).",

The OD 450 values of MAbs 4G10 and 10E9 against F1, F3-F8, F10, and F11 were much higher than the values against F2, F9, and F12 ( p < 0.05) (Fig. 5A ). In addition, the binding of MAb 1C10 to fragments F1, F3, F4, F13, F15, and F16 was significantly higher than that to fragments F2, F14, and F17 ( p < 0.01) (Fig. 5B) . Finally, the OD 450 values of MAb 2F10 against F1, F3, F4, F18, F19, F20, F22, and F23 were noticeably higher than those against F2, F21, and F24 ( p < 0.05) (Fig. 5C ). These data confirmed the Western blot analysis and disclosed specific antigenic epitopes recognized by these MAbs. Amino acid differences of identified epitopes in different M. suis strains We next determined the prevalence of these MSG1 epitopes among various M. suis strains. To this end, we aligned sequences of MSG1 from eight M. suis strains, with GAPDH from seven other species. The amino acid sequence L 251 CLKI 255 was highly conserved among all M. suis strains. In addition, the epitopes I 268 KDGENE 274 and D 291 THGSVF 297 were moderately conserved, except for the amino acid differences at positions 273 (N273S) and 296 (V296I) (Fig. 6) . These data confirmed that the antigenic epitopes identified by Western blot and ELISA are highly conserved among MSG1 sequences and highly variable among GAPDH in other species.",

Streptococci binds fibronectin, lysozyme, and cytoskeletal proteins such as myosin and actin.
