The present study was envisaged for carrying out thorough investigation of the disease among working dogs of organised kennels situated in different agro-climatic zones of India as comprehensive understanding of the disease from this country was pertinently lacking. During the study period of three years (2012-2014), 330 dogs suspected for babesiosis were examined for clinicopathology by their physical examination, haematological and biochemical parameters estimation, while the detection of apicomplexan parasites was confirmed by using various diagnostic techniques i.e. by conventional microscopy, by two different Babesia specific 18S rRNA based PCR protocols (conventional/simple PCR and nested PCR assays) followed by sequencing of obtained PCR amplicons for Babsesia spp. identification. Out of 330 clinical cases screened 5.15% (17/330), 9.09% (30/330) and 15.45% (51/330) were found to be positive in microscopic examination, simple-and nested-PCR assay, respectively. Comparative statistical analyses of these diagnostic assay results revealed that significant difference exists among the three diagnostic methodologies and thus it is recommended that the nested PCR technique be relied upon as a screening molecular assay and also for epidemiological studies of the disease in this country. Phylogenetic analysis based on 18S rRNA depicted the monophyletic nature and clonal expansion among all the B. gibsoni, under study. Sequencing results of PCR amplicons revealed that B. gibsoni has predominantly established itself over B. vogeli as former was incriminated in 47 cases while latter was confirmed in only four animals. Based on the clinical severity, these 51 affected animals were classified into three main groups' of 17 animals each viz., apparently healthy-, simple or uncomplicated babesiosis-and atypical or complicated babesiosisgroup. Haematological and biochemical profiling of these dogs confirmed the characteristics findings of infection by both the Babesia spp. It was observed that the infection by small form of Babesia (B. gibsoni) is posing a significant therapeutic challenge and chemosterilization by commonly prescribed anti-protozoal drugs was not achieved as clinical relapses were often observed. The clinical signs, sequence based confirmation and severity of the infection suggested that there is a positive selection of B. gibsoni (smaller form) over B. vogeli (larger form) in this country and raises serious concerns as prognosis in former is considered to be poor compared to latter. Thus, these findings have opened new paradigms for planning of pragmatic control strategies against this emerging canine health problem.",

            "text": "Canine babesiosis (or piroplasmosis) is a significant and potentially life threatening tick-borne protozoan disease of dog populations, worldwide. The disease is caused by intraerythrocytic parasites of the genus Babesia, order Piroplasmida, phylum Apicomplexa (Irwin, 2009) . Two distinct forms of Babesia are recognized by morphometric evaluation during microscopic examinations of blood smears:-large forms (2.5-5.0 \u03bcm) which consist of three species viz., B. canis, B. rossi and B. vogeli and the small forms (1.0-2.5 \u03bcm) comprising of the. B. gibsoni, B. conradae and B. microti like piroplasms. Among all the species of Babesia infecting dogs, B. rossi and B. gibsoni are considered to be highly pathogenic species with poor prognosis (Irwin, 2009) . To date, canine babesiosis encompasses two main species in this country viz., B. vogeli and B. gibsoni (Kundu et al., 2012; Mandal et al., 2014) . Both of these pathogens are well known Babesia species among domestic canine population and globally distributed across the continents, making them good example of 'parasite globalization'. Increase in international travels with pet dogs as companion animals or for commercial trade and climatic/ecosystem changes favouring expansion of vector tick habitats have also immensely contributed to their ubiquitous distribution and rapid spread across the continents (Solano-Gallego and Baneth, 2011; Schnittger et al., 2012) . Varying range of temperature and humidity conditions favouring vector tick survival and existence of stray canine population in large numbers supports transmission of Babesia spp. among canines in India (Abd Rani et al., 2011) .",

Thus, depending on the clinical severity, canine babesiosis can be classified as uncomplicated-or complicated-form or can also be classified as peracute-, acute-and subclinical or chronic-form of the disease. In uncomplicated babesiosis, clinical signs are results of haemolytic anaemia. These include pyrexia, anorexia, pale mucous membrane, anaemia, tachypnoea, tachycardia, splenomegaly, icterus, malaise and apathy (Taboada and Merchant, 1991) . Complicated form of canine babesiosis is characterized by additional organ involvement viz., acute renal failure (ARF), hepatopathy, cerebral babesiosis, coagulopathy, immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia (IMHA), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), haemoconcentration and shock (Lobetti, 1998) . Hitherto, such diverse clinical manifestations have not been studied from India. Hence, the present study has been attempted to understand varying manifestation of the disease and its outcome.",

A fastidious microscopic study may even lead to errors due to low sensitivity and specificity inherent to the technique. Reports of studies comparing different diagnostic techniques are limited since 'gold standard' assay for diagnosis of these apicomplexan parasites are not clearly established (Karagenc et al., 2006) . Although, with the advancement of the nucleic acid amplification techniques like PCR, loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay and quantitative PCR (Ikadai et al., 2004; Mandal et al., 2015; Qurollo et al., 2017) diagnostic sensitivity has increased manifold in recent years. Most of the simple/ single-step PCR assays for detection of canine Babesia spp. have targeted 18S ribosomal RNA gene. Moreover, sequencing of 18S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer-1 (ITS-1) have also been used for molecular phylogeny studies of this parasite (Mandal et al., 2014) . Serological tests including indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFAT) for diagnosis of babesiosis are less popular due to cross reactivity with other closely related piroplasmids (Irwin, 2009) . Canine babesiosis still presents a significant diagnostic challenge and this is especially true for asymptomatic carriers or chronic reservoir dogs where in false negative PCR results may be observed.",

Working dog population in this country, which are used under varied geographical terrains, climatic regions and in urban/suburb/rural habitats, runs the risks for exposure to ticks and tick borne diseases. This may be due to their exposure to feral canine and stray dog populations during their deployment. There has been no detailed study of canine babesiosis among working dogs of organised kennels from different agro-climatic zones of this country. This study is an attempt for correlating the disease with the clinical signs, anamnesis, prognosis, haematological and biochemical parameters of positive cases. Diagnosis in these cases was achieved using microscopy of stained thin smears, simple PCR-, nested PCR-assay and post sequencing phylogeny. Histopathological studies were also conducted in fatal cases encountered during the study period. Present work was thus undertaken in an extensive manner to bridge the existing knowledge gap and to provide comprehensive understanding of canine babesiosis among working dogs in organised canine establishments of this country.",

Central Indian state, Uttar Pradesh was chosen for sampling from sub tropical humid conditions while samples from tropical semiarid regions were collected from western state of Maharashtra. Three hundred and thirty working dogs suspected for canine babesiosis along with in-contact and apparently healthy dogs from these organised kennels at various locations as mentioned were included in the present study. These organised kennels have been meticulously following recommended vaccination, acaricide and deworming schedules in their dogs. Moreover, these organized kennels especially maintained Labrador Retriever and German Shepherd breeds of working dogs as these two breeds of the dogs form the major corpus of working dogs/security dogs not only in this country but also globally. The clinical samples were collected over a period of three years from Jan, 2012 to Dec, 2014. Details of the age, breed, sex and clinical manifestations of disease among 51 nested PCR positive cases have been recorded and summarized in Table 1 .

Overall prevalence among 330 dogs was 15.45% (51/330) by nested PCR, 9.09% (30/330) by simple PCR and 5.15% (17/330) by microscopy. McNemars chi square test estimated the pvalues between the diagnostic assays. P-values estimated were less than 0.0001 (p < 0.0001), for microscopy/nested PCR and nested PCR/simple PCR comparision pairs. Results obtained from nested PCR and simple PCR were significantly distinct from microscopy at p < 0.05 and similarly, nested PCR results also differed significantly from simple PCR results (p < 0.05) too. Inter-rater agreement between the microscopy and nested PCR tests were evaluated using kappa (\u03ba) statistics. Kappa \u00b1 standard error value was estimated as \u03ba \u00b1 se = 0.426 \u00b1 0.075, which is a moderate agreement between the observations, obtained from microscopic examination and nested PCR (Viera and Garrett, 2005) . Kappa statistics of nested PCR and simple PCR assays were estimated as \u03ba \u00b1 se = 0.707 \u00b1 0.059, which indicates a substantial agreement between the observation obtained from the two tests (Viera and Garrett, 2005 ",

Tick vector borne diseases have not been studied in working dogs from organised kennels of India. Present study was focused on getting comprehensive information about the presence of canine babesiosis from the working dogs of organised kennels located in different geographical locations using various diagnostic tools like conventional M. Mittal, et al. Preventive Veterinary Medicine 169 (2019) 104696 microscopy as used as molecular assays (simple PCR, nested PCR and sequence analysis). These diagnostic assay results were correlated with clinical manifestations, haematology and biochemical parameters from these dogs. During this study, myriad conditions and their clinical manifestations of canine babesiosis due to B. gibsoni were observed. These varied from mild anaemia, transient anorexia to complex syndrome of multiple organ failure and fatality. Overall, it seems that canine babesiosis in this country does not have a simple manifestation but has at least three clinically different forms. Asymptomatic form of disease was manifested by chronic or subclinical carrier dogs that were generally observed to be apparently healthy. Classical or uncomplicated forms resulted from haemolytic anaemia while complicated form of disease involved the additional organ failure (ARF, ARDS, hepatopathy, cerebral babesiosis, coagulopathy and MODS) besides haemolytic anaemia.",

In the present study, 56.86% of the dogs presented haemolytic anaemia which is in agreement with the previous studies (Kraje, 2001; Furlanello et al., 2005) . Three mechanism of haemolytic anaemia have been postulated for canine babesiosis: mechanical, immune-mediated and toxic by the production of haemolytic factor of the parasite (Onishi et al., 1990; Bourdeau and Guelfi, 1995) . BUN and creatinine levels were higher in ten animals indicative of ARF. Possible reasons of this elevated level in some of the dogs may be due to non-renal accumulation of ammonia in serum as a result of haemolytic anaemia. Significant biochemical findings of hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia resulting in the decrease in the AG ratio in 52.94% animals; increase of serum activity of AST and ALT were observed as previously described (Pages et al., 1990; Bourdeau and Guelfi, 1995; Lobetti, 2000; Welzl et al., 2001) .",

MODS in complicated cases of canine babesiosis are characterized by involvement of different organs (Welzl et al., 2001; Jacobson, 2006) . Though MODS is common with B. rossi infections, four dogs in the present study showed MODS. The possible mechanism of MODS may be due to the uncontrolled proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory mechanisms involved in acute phase reactions causing auto-destructive inflammation in various organs (Goris et al., 1985) . Five dogs died as a result of canine babesiosis (attributed to B. gibsoni). Two dogs were suffering from MODS while in remaining three cases sudden death due to septic shock was observed. Mortality is common with B. rossi infections and may reach to around 10-15% (Matijatko et al., 2009 ). Our study revealed overall case fatality rate of 9.80% (05/ 51) among B. gibsoni positive cases. This was 29.41% (05/17) of complicated cases of babesiosis. Epilepsy due to cerebral babesiosis was seen in four dogs i.e. overall 7.84% (04/51) of positive cases. This was 23.53% (04/17) among atypical (complicated) babesiosis cases. This finding is contrary to previous studies (Welzl et al., 2001; Matijatko et al., 2009 ) where central nervous system dysfunction was observed to be the rarest complication due to canine babesiosis as it was found to be quiet significant in the present study. Coma, collapse and other neurobiological signs that are attributed to cerebral babesiosis may be due to hypoglycaemia and ischemia (Matijatko et al., 2009; Jacobson and Lobetti, 2005) .",

Present study among working dogs of organised kennels from India revealed B. gibsoni and B. vogeli are two main Babesia species, former being the predominant species. B. vogeli usually causes a subclinical to mild or moderate clinical disease in adult dogs (Carret et al., 1999; Uilenberg et al., 1989 ) while severe to fatal haemolytic anaemia has been reported in juvenile dogs and pups (Solano-Gallego et al., 2008) . No fatal infection among juvenile dogs and pups was reported. Four pups (four to six months age) were found to be infected with B. vogeli where as one pup (eight month of age) and one juvenile dog (one year of age) was found to be infected with B. gibsoni. As reported elsewhere, pathogenic potential of B. vogeli was also observed in the present study to be mild or subclinical only as haematological and biochemical parameters in pups infected with B. vogeli were found to be within normal range while pup and juvenile dog infected with B. gibsoni were reported to have slightly low Hb concentration (9-10 g m%). This study further substantiates that B. gibsoni infection doesn't appear to be associated with age. While screening the blood samples, surprisingly the dogs which were apparently healthy i.e. not manifesting clinical signs were also found positive in single-step PCR and nested PCR. This finding correlates with the earlier findings where subclinical infection and chronic infection of B. gibsoni has been reported in adult dogs (Birkenheuer et al., 2005) . The present study has shown that B. gibsoni predominates B. vogeli as a major pathogen among working dogs in this country and raises a serious concern over almost twofold increase in the prevalence of canine babesiosis in 2013 (19.82%) in comparison of prevalence of 10.24% in 2012 which is more important in the context that stray dogs were not included in this study. Stray dogs are a major chunk of domestic canine population in India and are known to act as reservoir of the same. This study pertinently emphasizes for the timely control measures to be installed at top priority for the control of canine babesiosis in India.",

Serological assays do not definitely discriminate Babesia spp. and due to their cross-reactivity along with persistence of antibodies for several months even after the infection make them less popular for individual diagnosis and for epidemiological studies of canine babesiosis (Irwin, 2009 ) and hence were not used in the present study.",

            "text": "Nucleic acid based amplification techniques, especially PCR have been proven to be valuable tool for the diagnosis of parasitic diseases (Gasser, 2006) . PCR with a sensitivity and specificity of nearly 100% as determined by various workers Inokuma et al., 2005; Martin et al., 2006) have been useful for the detection of Babesia DNA in the canine blood samples. Microscopy is prone to errors and is also known for its poor sensitivity. Significant difference in diagnostic results of single-step PCR and of nested PCR protocols were too found to be statistically significant ( During the study, babesiosis caused by large form of B. vogeli was commonly treated with imidocarb dipropionate and diminazene aceturate with good prognosis while B. gibsoni were found to be more resistant to the anti-babesial therapy and prognosis of the cases remained poor. Clinical and parasitological cure are often not achieved in the treatment of B. gibsoni infections and clinical relapses are frequently noticed (Irwin, 2009) . B. gibsoni infection is resistant to treatment with imidocarb dipropionate and diminazene aceturate, which are two main drugs currently being widely used in India although recommended therapy is the combination of the anti-malarial atovaquone and the macrolide azithromycin for clearance/elimination of B. gibsoni infection (Birkenheuer et al., 2004) . In this study, it was observed that the treatment regime being followed in the Indian field conditions by most of the clinicians is mainly empirical and is focused on symptomatic recovery and not on elimination of the infection. This could be one of the reasons for high number of subclinical infection diagnosed in this study and many apparently healthy dogs testing positive in nested PCR. Moreover, treatment regimen is based on tentative diagnosis of haemoprotozoan infection and comprises of use of multidrug therapy ranging from oxytetracycline, doxycycline, metronidazole, clindamycin, azithromycin, diminazene aceturate and imidocarb dipropionate along with other supportive drugs. All these drugs have been reported to have some efficacy against B. gibsoni but are not completely Table 3 Haematological parameters obtained from 51 dogs found positive for canine babesiosis in group wise depiction based on clinical disease diagnosed (Group-1-dogs with subclinical babesiosis; Group-2-dogs with uncomplicated babesiosis or simple babesiosis; Group-3-dogs with complicated babesiosis). Changes in the haematological parameters are indicated as increased, decreased or unchanged (remained within normal/reference range) and the normal/reference range* are as per the values standardised by Central Military Veterinary Laboratory for screening of dog blood samples. effective in eliminating the parasitaemia. At the best, these drugs can only result in amelioration of the clinical sings. To date, a therapy comprising of anti-malarial atovaquinone (at dose rate of 13.5 mg/kg bwt PO tid with fatty meal for 10 days) and the macrolide azithromycin (at dose rate of 10 mg/kg bwt q24 h for 10 days) combination have only shown promising results in the clearance of B. gibsoni infection. Unfortunately, atovaquinone is not readily available in India and due to lack of awareness and high cost, this drug is not being used by veterinarians and this may have contributed in the positive selection of B. gibsoni infection over B. vogeli in the field. In the absence of recommended treatment for B. gibsoni infection, field veterinarians find the treatment of babesiosis to be frustrating with most of the cases relapsing after initial recovery and most of them either suffered from subclinical/chronic infection while some suffered with severe infection/MODS/septic shock. Thus, B. gibsoni babesiosis poses a significant and complex therapeutic challenge for the practitioners of this country as current babesiacidal drugs were found only effective in preventing the clinical disease and not in eliminating the infection. In the absence of prophylactic vaccination in this country, chemoprophylaxis against the ticks' infestations was carried out by use of acaricides applications (spot-on, sprays, neck collars, shampoos, dips and powders) and by tick removal during the regular physical inspection of these working dogs. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial 18S rRNA revealed that the gene is highly conserved and depicted the monophyletic nature and clonal expansion of all the B. gibsoni isolates under study. Interestingly, two sequences (KJ439649 and KJ439648) being reported from the present study although showed best match (100% and 99% identity) with both B. vogeli and B. canis sequences available in the NCBI database in the BLAST analysis but these sequences somehow clustered in the B. canis group. Although it is tempting to assign these two isolates to B. canis species based on their genetic grouping pattern, it may be too early to draw any conclusion at this stage considering the fact that B. canis has so far never been reported from India and only 281 nucleotide sequence stretch was used in present analysis that could have missed relevant phylogenetically informative sites. Non-vectorial i.e. direct dog-to-dog transmission through bite (Jefferies et al., 2007) or through blood transfusion (Stegeman et al., 2003) and transplacental transmission of B. gibsoni (Fukumoto et al., 2005) are some of the possible explanation for its clonal expansion.",

Thus, canine babesiosis with its continuously changing distribution is posing a significant global threat and with reports of humans being accidental hosts of B. vogeli in splenectomised patients with acute renal failure (Marsaudon et al., 1995) along with high conglomerations and anthropophilic tendency of R. sanguineus (Goddard, 1989) has also sparked 'One Health' concerns associated to it.",

The disease is endemic as observed by its prevalence across the different agro-climatic zones of this country. During the study it was also inferred that this small piroplasm has established itself predominantly over B. vogeli and is on the rise among the canine population of this country. Moreover, clinical disease due to B. gibsoni in this country is being manifested by three different forms viz., asymptomatic or subclinical-, classical or uncomplicated-and atypical or complicated-form of disease. Furthermore, from diagnostic point of view, conventional microscopic examination and simple PCR based molecular detection methods for these apicomplexan parasites were found to be inadequate especially in chronically infected animals manifesting asymptomatic infection. Although, conventional/simple PCR protocols are considered to be ideal methods for laboratory diagnosis of canine babesiosis but the present study argues that nested PCR instead of simple PCR be relied upon as a screening assay and also for epidemiological studies as statistical significant false-negative animals were observed among the latter results. These findings not only provide better understanding of the canine babesiosis but will also assist in planning of pragmatic preventive strategies against this potent threat especially in countries akin to India where the endemic scenario of the disease exists.",
