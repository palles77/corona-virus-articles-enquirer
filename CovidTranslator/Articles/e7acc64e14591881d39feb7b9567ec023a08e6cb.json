            "text": "The therapeutic application of siRNA shows promise as an alternative approach to small molecule inhibitors for the treatment of human disease. However, the major obstacle to its use has been the difficulty in delivering these large anionic molecules in vivo. In this study, we have investigated whether siRNA-mediated knockdown of p38 MAP kinase mRNA in mouse lung is influenced by conjugation to the non-viral delivery vector cholesterol and the cell penetrating peptides (CPP) TAT(48-60) and penetratin. Initial studies in the mouse fibroblast L929 cell line, showed that siRNA conjugated to cholesterol, TAT(48-60) and penetratin but not siRNA alone achieved a limited reduction of p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression. Intratracheal administration of siRNA resulted in localisation within macrophages and scattered epithelial cells and produced a 30-45% knockdown of p38 MAP kinase mRNA at 6hrs. As with increasing doses of siRNA, conjugation to cholesterol improved upon the duration but not the magnitude of mRNA knockdown whilst penetratin and TAT(48-60) had no effect. Importantly, administration of the penetratin or TAT(48-60) peptides alone caused significant reduction in p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression whilst the penetratin-siRNA conjugate activated the innate immune response. Overall, these studies suggest that conjugation to cholesterol may extend but not increase siRNA mediated p38 CPP and cholesterol-siRNA conjugates in mouse lung Supporting Information Available: Figure S1 , dose-dependent percentile p38 MAP kinase mRNA levels in vitro following lipofection with three mouse p38 MAP kinase siRNA or two mismatch controls; Figure S2 , analytical HPLC and electrospray mass spectrograms of peptide-and cholesteryl-RNA constructs; Figure S3 , analytical gels of CPP and cholesterol conjugate annealing products; Figure S4 , cell viability following incubation with siRNA, CPP or siRNA conjugates; Figure S5 , p38 MAP kinase expression across a mouse tissue panel. This information is available free of charge via the Internet at MAP kinase mRNA knockdown in the lung. Furthermore, the use of CPP may be limited due to as yet uncharacterized effects upon gene expression and a potential for immune activation.",

            "text": "Compared with small molecule inhibitors, the relatively large size and anionic charge of siRNA means that one of the key barriers to their in vivo use is the availability of effective approaches for delivery both to specific tissues and across the plasma membrane. Since intravenous siRNA administration is subject to first-pass metabolism, unless a liver condition is being targeted (i.e. hepatitis C infection), therapeutic application is limited to tissues where siRNA localisation for extended periods is possible, e.g. following intra-ocular injection for the treatment of macular degeneration. In the case of the lung, the structure of the tissue permits direct access to large numbers of cells within the branching airways and alveoli, an estimated surface area of 400 m 2 in man. Importantly, the facility of topical delivery via either intranasal, intratracheal or aerosol administration suggests the lung as an ideal target organ for siRNA-based therapeutics. Indeed, studies have shown siRNAmediated attenuation of cytokine (7) and heme oxygenase-1 (8) induced expression during acute lung injury. Similarly, intranasal and intratracheal siRNA administration have been shown to prevent para-influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (PIV and RSV respectively) infection in mice (9) (10) (11) (12) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infection in rhesus monkeys (13) .",

            "text": "In the majority of these studies, cationic lipids (e.g. Lipofectin) and polymers (e.g. PEI and dendrimers) have been employed to package and deliver the siRNA to the lung. However, generic application of these strategies is limited by drawbacks such as toxicity and siRNAmediated induction of immune responses through Toll like receptors (TLR) (14) (15) (16) . In an attempt to circumvent these problems, we examined the utility of chemical conjugation of siRNA to the non-viral delivery vector cholesterol and the cell penetrating peptides (CPP) penetratin and TAT(48-60) to improve siRNA mediated mRNA knockdown in the mouse lung. Specifically, we attempted to target the constitutively expressed p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase (also known as MAPK14). Activation of this protein is known to be important in the release of multiple pro-inflammatory mediators including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1. Indeed, many pharmaceutical companies are developing small molecule inhibitors that target p38 MAP kinase to be used in the treatment of a host of inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and psoriasis (17, 18) . cholesterol conjugated siRNA was shown to silence endogenous apolipoprotein B (ApoB) gene expression in the liver and jejunum resulting in decreased plasma levels of apoB protein and total cholesterol (20) . Interestingly, a recent study has shown that the delivery of siRNA targeted to ApoB can be further increased \u223c20-fold compared to cholesterol conjugation by formulation in stabilised nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALP) (21) . Additional evidence of the utility of cholesterol for oligonucleotide delivery is provided in a recent report showing cholesterol-mediated delivery of 2\u2032-O-methyl and phosphorothioatemodified single stranded RNA for the knockdown of microRNA expression in the liver, lung, kidney, heart, intestine, fat, skin, bone marrow, muscle, ovaries and adrenal glands following intravenous injection (22) .",

However, although conjugation to cholesterol, TAT(48-60) or penetratin facilitated knockdown of p38 MAP kinase mRNA in a mouse cell line, only cholesterol-siRNA conjugates were found to influence target gene mRNA levels in vivo. Importantly, since both CPP inhibited p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression in vivo, but not in vitro, we document the existence of as yet uncharacterised CPP bioactivity. Moreover, the detection of innate immune response induction by penetratin-siRNA but not TAT(48-60)-siRNA conjugates suggests differential cellular uptake mechanisms between the two CPP.",

To this end, the concentration dependent knockdown achieved by three siRNAs was determined in the L929 mouse fibroblast cell line at 24 hrs ( Figure S1 ) following reverse transfection with Lipofectamine 2000. Thus, an efficacious sequence (C) was selected that gave a maximal knockdown of 87% and an EC 50 of 139pM when transfected into the cells with lipofectamine ( Figure 1 ). As a negative control, we identified a 4 mismatch siRNA sequence that gave no significant knockdown except at the highest concentration of 100nM, where we observed a p38 MAP kinase mRNA reduction of \u223c20% ( Figure 1 ). To facilitate the conjugation of TAT(48-60), penetratin or cholesterol upon siRNA, the 5\u2032 end of the siRNA sense strand was modified with a C6-thiol linker, providing a thiol group for disulphide conjugation with a cysteine residue on the CPP (Analytical HPLC and electrospray mass spectrograms available in Figure S2 ). C6-thiol linker modified sense strands and CPP-sense strand conjugates were then annealed to the antisense strand to yield siRNA duplexes. To evaluate the impact of the conjugation of the C6-thiol linker group on the biological action of the siRNA, C6-thiol modified siRNA duplexes were transfected using lipofectamine 2000 in cultured L929 fibroblasts. Addition of the C6-thiol linker to the siRNA had no significant effect upon the magnitude of knockdown but caused a shift in the EC 50 to 798pM ( Figure  1 ). Visual examination of CPP-siRNA constructs showed no precipitation, whilst separation on 20% polyacrylamide gels demonstrated the formation of discrete annealed products ( Figure S2 ). In contrast, annealing of the cholesterol-siRNA gave a higher molecular weight product, suggesting the formation of higher order structures.",

To eliminate the possibility that the observed reductions in p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression might have resulted from the activation of this response, we measured the levels of the immune markers IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 p40 in whole lung. As expected, the positive controls lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly(I:C), known activators of the immune response through of TLR4 and TLR3 respectively, induced a robust increase in IFN\u03b1 production at 6hrs whilst LPS increased TNF\u03b1 at 1hr (Figure 7) . Interestingly, with the exception of penetratin-siRNA, none of the experimental agents induced an immune response following intratracheal administration; in the case of penetratin-siRNA we observed a significant increase in the expression of TNF\u03b1 and IL-12p40, as well as elevated release of IFN\u03b1 (Figure 7) . As a means of controlling for contaminating LPS in the dosing preparations, potentially influencing p38 MAP kinase expression or inducing immune activation, measurement of LPS content was included in our siRNA quality control process.

The chosen target was p38 MAP kinase, a key component of inflammatory signal transduction pathways whose inhibition can ameliorate inflammatory responses (17, 18) , constitutively expressed in a variety of lungassociated cell types including epithelial, endothelial, macrophage, eosinophil, fibroblast and smooth muscle cell types. The quantities of siRNA employed in our investigation, which were approximately 37.5mg/kg (50nmol), 7.5mg/kg (10nmol) and 0.75mg/kg (1nmol), are comparable to those reported as efficacious in lung. Thus, a 2mg/kg siRNA dose was employed to attenuate heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) expression (8) and a 5mg/kg dose was found to reduce RSV and PIV titer in the lung (12) . Following intratracheal administration, sequence-specific siRNA-mediated p38 MAP kinase mRNA knockdown was observed as early as 6hrs, implying rapid uptake and action of naked siRNA upon the target gene mRNA levels. However, the short duration of knockdown observed with 1nmol and 10nmol doses, quickly reversed within 12hrs, suggested that naked siRNA might be rapidly degraded and that its action might be extended through chemical stabilization. Indeed, BAL fluid stability studies showed that even though full length siRNA could still be recovered at 7 hrs, cleavage did indeed occur, detectable as early as 15 min.",

Indeed, little is known about the biochemistry of p38 MAP kinase mRNA level homeostasis as research has focused on phosphorylation of the protein, a key part of the inflammatory signal transduction process (17, 18) . In this respect, we have observed no significant change in p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression in the mouse lung 4 hrs after a 30 min challenge with 0.1 mg/ml aerosolised LPS (0.88\u00b10.29-fold p38 MAP kinase relative mRNA levels to saline challenged controls; Moschos., unpublished data). Therefore, either MAPK14 mRNA levels are either not affected by cellular stress signals such LPS-induced inflammation, or are closely monitored and strictly maintained at specific levels. Our findings of an apparent limit on the maximal mRNA knockdown achievable in vivo lends further weight to this hypothesis; we were unable to overcome this threshold, since increasing the siRNA dose to 50nmol improved the duration but not the magnitude of the response. Notwithstanding homeostasis, additional contributors to the limited knockdown could be uneven lung distribution, localisation in the immediate epithelial cell layer or poor cellular uptake. We therefore examined the distribution of Cy3 labelled siRNA by histology and showed uptake into macrophages and scattered airway epithelial cells. However, the total tissue mRNA downregulation by about 30-45% was comparable to that seen in the liver following intravenous administration of cholesterol linked and stabilised siRNA (20) .",

To dissociate the sense strand from the delivery vector in the cytosol, we included a disulphide bond within our conjugation chemistry, believed to be cleaved intracellularly. Examination of the biological action of this modified siRNA in vitro showed that conjugation of the C6-thiol linker increased the EC 50 but did not affect the maximal level of mRNA knockdown (\u223c85%). This magnitude of efficacy in cell culture is similar to that reported for other siRNAs that have been successfully used in vivo (41) , thus ratifying our choice of conjugation chemistry.",

In contrast, the cholesterol, penetratin and TAT(48-60) constructs produced a small (20 -40%) but significant mRNA knockdown without inducing toxicity. Importantly, this was determined to be siRNAspecific as no effect was observed by equimolar quantities of the two unconjugated CPP. However, the uptake mechanism appears highly inefficient since these concentrations were > 100,000x higher than those effective with Lipofectamine 2000. Surprisingly, previous cell based studies using siRNA conjugated to cholesterol-, penetratin or TAT(48-60) (35) gave values reportedly in the sub-micromolar range. The reason for these differences is presently unknown although they could be related to the gene target, cell type and/or the type of synthetic construct. The majority of investigators have, like ourselves, attached the delivery vector to the 5\u2032 -end of the sense strand via a disulphide bond (19, (32) (33) (34) , although Chiu et al (35) attached TAT(48-60) to the 3\u2032-end of the antisense strand and in the report by Soutschek et al. (20) the cholesterol moiety was conjugated to the 3\u2032 -end of the sense strand via a pyrrolidone linker. Crucially, unlike ourselves, many investigators do not report postconjugation HPLC purification in the presence of denaturing agents to remove excess, unconjugated cationic CPP from CPP-siRNA conjugates. As with electrostatic based delivery systems such as cationic lipids and polymers, omission of this purification step is likely to result in the formation of complexes between excess CPP and CPP-siRNA conjugates that might increase the efficacy of uptake (42) .",

Significantly, these studies failed to show an effect of conjugation to the cell penetrating peptides TAT(48-60) or penetratin upon either lung distribution, magnitude or duration of p38 MAP kinase mRNA knockdown. Strikingly, penetratin peptide alone induced a significant downregulation in p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression at 6hrs and, in the case of TAT(48-60), this was also observed at 12 and 24hrs. This data therefore document a biological action of these peptides upon gene expression, or associated regulatory processes.

Indeed, in associated studies in our laboratory using the lung epithelial cell line A549 exposed to TAT(48-60) and penetratin, we have been unable to detect toxicity at concentrations up to 30\u03bcM (43) . Alternatively, down-regulation of p38 MAP kinase mRNA expression might occur following the interaction of CPP with extracellular or intracellular targets. Indeed, extracellular CPP-protein interactions are likely as Fotin-Mleczek et al. (44) have shown that both TAT(48-60) and penetratin induce clathrin-dependent uptake of the TNF\u03b1 and EGF receptors without their activation, though the exact mechanism is unknown. Also, given the fact that CPP are derived from the DNA binding domains of transcription factors and are highly positively charged, it might be envisaged that once taken up into cells at high concentrations, these peptides directly interfere with gene transcription. Interestingly, the high-affinity binding of CPP to both plasma membranes and genomic DNA has previously been shown to result in erroneous conclusions about the mechanism of CPP uptake (45, 46) . Interpretation of our findings as an indication of global gene expression perturbation by CPP is restricted by the lack of effect of CPP on the expression of MAPK14 in vitro even at concentrations as high as 10 \u03bcM. In terms of a direct effect of CPPs in the regulation of MAPK14 gene expression, lack of specific effects on the MAPK14 locus by means of CPP-DNA interactions can be postulated only under the assumption that no significant sequence differences exist between the genome of the BALB/c mice used in our in vivo experiments and that of the L929 cell line (derived from C3H/An). Instead, a more likely scenario would favor CPPs targeting of the signal transduction pathways or transcriptional regulators of MAPK14 gene expression. Alternatively, the viral origin of some CPP coupled to the internalization of cytokine receptors might be expected to activate the anti-viral innate response, resulting in inhibition of transcription. However, such a mechanism would appear unlikely as associated pro-inflammatory marker release in vivo was not detected.",
