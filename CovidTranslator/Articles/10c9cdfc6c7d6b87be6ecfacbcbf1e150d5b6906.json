This positive RNA virus encodes a large replicase polyprotein made up of 16 gene products (nsp1-16), amongst which two methyltransferases, nsp14 and nsp16, are involved in viral mRNA cap formation. The crystal structure of nsp16 is unknown. Nsp16 is an RNA-cap AdoMet-dependent (nucleoside-2 0 -O-)-methyltransferase that is only active in the presence of nsp10. In this paper, the expression, purification and crystallization of nsp10 in complex with nsp16 are reported. The crystals diffracted to a resolution of 1.9 \u00c5 resolution and crystal structure determination is in progress.",

The identified agent, a previously unknown coronavirus, was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Much like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV has an $30 kb RNA genome with a 5 0 cap and a 3 0 poly(A) tail . The genome of SARS-CoV codes for two large polyproteins 1a and 1ab, which are autoproteolytically processed by at least two viral proteases, producing 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). These nsps are thought to form a huge protein complex that is responsible for viral RNA replication and transcription. In addition, a set of subgenomic mRNAs encoding structural and accessory proteins is produced by a sophisticated mechanism involving nested mRNA synthesis using the full-length genomic RNA as template. These mRNAs are thought to be capped and polyadenylated (Lai & Stohlman, 1981; van Vliet et al., 2002) .",

In many cases, the crystal structures allowed scientists to suggest or to ascertain a biochemical function for the nsps, such as nsp7-nsp8, which acts as an RNA-dependent RNA primase (Imbert et al., 2006) , and the nsp15 endonuclease, the active site of which has been found to share structural homology to the active site of RNAse A (Ricagno et al., 2006; Joseph et al., 2007) . The process of RNA capping, however, has not yet benefitted from this structural work. Structural data is lacking for the enzymes that are putatively involved in mRNA capping.",

The nascent mRNA transcript endures a limited dephosphorylation in which the last 5 0 -phosphate is removed by a 5 0 -RNA triphosphatase. A guanylyltransferase (also named capping enzyme) attaches a GMP molecule onto the 5 0 -diphosphate RNA in a 5 0 -to-5 0 orientation. The capped RNA is then methylated at the N7 position of the cap guanine nucleotide by an N7-guanine methyltransferase. This yields a cap-0 structure ( m7 GpppNN . . . ) as found mainly in yeasts and lower eukaryotes. In higher eukaryotes and plants, a second methyltransferase acts on the first transcribed nucleotide at its 2 0 -O position to yield a cap-1 structure ( m7 GpppN 2 0 Om N . . . ), such as that found on coronavirus mRNAs (Lai & Stohlman, 1981; van Vliet et al., 2002) .",

Optimization of crystal-growth conditions led to the following condition: 0.1 M CHES pH 9, 1.52 M MgCl 2 . Crystals appeared after 24 h and visible growth stopped after 48-72 h. Before cooling the crystals to 100 K in a nitrogen-gas stream (Oxford Cryosystems), the crystals were briefly soaked in a cryoprotectant consisting of 15%(v/v) glycerol added to the mother liquor. Native diffraction data were recorded using either an ADSC Quantum 315 3 \u00c2 3 array detector on beamline PROXIMA 1 at the SOLEIL Synchrotron Radiation Facility or an ADSC Quantum 210 2 \u00c2 2 array detector on beamline ID14-EH1 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. Data were processed using XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and scaled with SCALA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) . Crystal parameters and data-collection statistics are summarized in Table 1 .",

Although significant amounts (on a milligram scale) of nsp16 can be obtained when expressed alone, the protein is unstable in a variety of buffers and precipitates under various storage conditions. Moreover, although signature-sequence analyses unambiguously identified a SAM-dependent methyltransferase fold (von Grotthuss et al., 2003; Decroly et al., 2008) , SARS-CoV nsp16 alone does not exhibit this enzymatic activity. In contrast, nsp10 is expressed to high levels in E. coli and can readily be purified and crystallized. Two structures of nsp10 crystal forms were published in 2006: one revealed monomers and dimers (Joseph et al., 2006) at 1.8 \u00c5 resolution (PDB entry 2fyg), whereas a complex dodecameric structure at 2.1 \u00c5 resolution (PDB entry 2g9t) was observed when nsp10 was expressed and crystallized as a fusion with nsp11 (Su et al., 2006) . Nevertheless, no function has been either predicted or demonstrated for nsp10, which is a zinc-binding protein.",

Nsp10 was cloned under the control of the tetA promoter in fusion with a Strep-Tag peptide at its N-terminus and nsp16 tagged with a hexahistidine tag at its N-terminus was inserted into the same plasmid under the T7lac promoter. After transformation into bacterial strain C41, protein expression was induced by the addition of IPTG and tetracycline for 16 h at 297 K. The bacterial lysate was clarified and nsp10 was adsorbed onto Strep-Tactin Sepharose beads. After several washes, the proteins bound to Strep-Tactin were eluted with 2.5 mM of the biotin analogue desthiobiotin. Upon SDS-PAGE analysis, we detected the presence of Strep-nsp10 and His 6 -nsp16 proteins migrating as expected at around 15 and 35 kDa, respectively, indicating that the two proteins had co-purified (Fig. 1) . The overall yield of the purified complex was typically 1 mg per litre of E. coli culture.

For this purpose, the nsp10-nsp16 complex was incubated with 0.005% SAB, a crosslinking reagent that specifically reacts with lysine residues. After SDS-PAGE separation, we detected the bands corresponding to nsp10 and nsp16 monomers as well as an additional band corresponding to a nsp10-nsp16 complex migrating around 50 kDa (lane Xtal in Fig. 3b) . The presence of nsp16 in the complex was also demonstrated by a methyltransferase assay which showed that the purified fraction containing the nsp10-nsp16 complex exhibited 2 0 -O-methyltransferase activity on short N7methylated capped RNA substrates .
