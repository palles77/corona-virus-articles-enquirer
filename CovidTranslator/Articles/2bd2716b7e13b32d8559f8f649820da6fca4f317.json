To create 'sick' bats, we injected a random half of 15 the bats (n=16) with the immune-challenging substance, lipopolysaccharide, and injected 16 control bats with saline (n=15). Over the next three days, we used proximity sensors to 17 continuously track their associations under natural conditions. The 'sick' bats showed a clear 18 decrease in social connectedness (degree, strength, and eigenvector centrality). Bats in the 19 control group encountered fewer 'sick' bats and also spent less time near them. These effects 20 varied by time of day and declined over 48 hours. High-resolution proximity data allow 21 researchers to define network connections based on how a pathogen spreads (e.g. the 22 minimum contact time or distance for transmission).

Tracking the effects of sickness behaviour 42 on a dynamic social network requires large datasets with temporal and spatial resolutions that 43 are high enough to be ecologically useful. Automated tracking of animal associations typically 44 occurs in the lab [1] or at specific field locations such as feeders or nest boxes [2] . Proximity 45 sensors by contrast can measure association times and durations, at high spatial and temporal 46 resolution, among free-ranging animals at any location [5] .

In practice, however, most social network edges are 62 . We captured bats from a colony of common vampire bats (Desmodus rotundus) inside a 70 hollow tree at Lamanai, Belize.

To investigate the effect of minimum encounter proximity, we set no minimum 141 duration (as in our original analysis), but filtered encounters using a proximity index threshold 142 that varied across several values from 76 -98 %. Proximity index thresholds below 76% are not 143 informative given the roost size; thresholds over 98% use less than 2% of the data. Finally, to 144 assess if the LPS treatment effect size was robust across different proximity thresholds, when 145 controlling for number of observations, we used several proximity index thresholds varying from 146 75% to 94% but we randomly sub-sampled the same number of observations in each case 147 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi. org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 Results 153 154",

During the hours of the treatment period, a 159 control bat had on average a 49% chance of associating with each control bat ([95% CI: 44, 54], 160 n = 105 pairs), but only a 35% chance of associating with each 'sick' bat ([31, 38] , n = 240 161 pairs). During the treatment period, the mean association rate for two control bats was 15 min 162 per h [13, 18], but for a control and 'sick' bat, it was only 10 min per h ([8, 11] , Figure 2 ). 163",

These effects were not caused by 219 spatial assortativity of 'sick' bats, because associations between two 'sick' bats were even lower 220 ( Figure 2 ). The behavioural changes causing these effects are evident from captive studies 221showing that LPS-injected vampire bats are less active [7] . They also produce fewer contact 222 calls [12] , which attract bonded partners [13] . When tested in a flight cage, 'sick' vampire bats 223 engaged in social grooming with fewer partners [6], but we observed dramatic reductions in 224 social grooming even when captive pairs were forced into close association [7] . LPS-induced 225 sickness behaviours therefore reduce both associations and behaviours, like social grooming, 226 which can further enhance pathogen transmission between associated bats. 227The effects of LPS vary by dose and among species [14] . For instance, in LPS-injected 228 rats, social exploration of juvenile conspecifics and locomotor activity largely returned to normal 229 after 24 hours [15] . Here, we found evidence for behavioural effects after 24 hours, which could 230 be due to an ongoing immune challenge, exhaustion post-recovery, or an attempt to save 231 energy from not foraging on the previous night. When defining network edges with continuous proximity data, there is a trade-off 253 between the number of observations and filtering closer encounters that are more relevant for a 254 given behaviour or pathogen. In this study, we used resampling to show the effect of defining 255 association at various thresholds of minimum duration and distance (Figure 3) . We recommend 256 this resampling procedure for testing the robustness of an effect across the range of durations 257 or distances that are biologically meaningful ( Figure S2 ). As tracking technology improves the 258 capacity to create dynamic networks from massive, high-resolution datasets, we expect 259 researchers to gain transformative insights into the patterns and processes underlying the 260 spread of pathogens, information, or behavioural states.
