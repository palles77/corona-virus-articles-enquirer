Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model was used to predict the trend of confirmed cases. Stata version 12 were used. Results: Parameters used for ARIMA were (2,1,0) for Mainland China, ARIMA (2,2,2) for Italy , ARIMA(1,0,0) for South Korea, ARIMA (2,3,0) for Iran, and ARIMA(3,1,0) for Thailand. Mainland China and Thailand had almost a stable trend. The trend of South Korea was decreasing and will become stable in near future. Iran and Italy had unstable trends. Conclusions: Mainland China and Thailand were successful in haltering COVID-19 epidemic. Investigating their protocol in this control like quarantine should be in the first line of other countries' program",

This can cause serious illness and death (1). It has since been identified as a zoonotic coronavirus, similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and was named 2019-nCoV (2) . A total number of 4515 cases including 106 deaths were confirmed on 27 th of January 2020 (3) . A local seafood market in Wuhan was visited by many cases in the initial research, and it is indicated that a commonsource zoonotic exposure may cause this new illness (4) The prevalence scope of this disease is unclear, because at present the prevalence of this disease is so dynamic(1). There is obvious variation among countries in epidemiological surveillance and detection capacity for suspected cases. (5) Several cases of COVID-19 infections were also reported outside China, in other Asian countries, the United States, France, Australia, and Canada. In this situation when the illness does not have any specific treatment, the prevention of disease and preparation in healthcare services is very important .",
