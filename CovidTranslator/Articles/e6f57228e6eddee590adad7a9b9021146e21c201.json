At necropsy, mesenteric fat inflammation and multiple subcutaneous, peritoneal, and intraabdominal nodules were observed. The lungs demonstrated congestion and heavy coagulation, and necrotic foci were observed on the cut surface. Histopathologically, the nodules were identified as granulomatous fatty tissue with numerous lymphocytes, infiltration with lipid-laden macrophages, and fibrosis. These changes were also noted in the lung. The etiology of this condition remains undetermined.",

The most useful are those based on the traditional histopathologic distinction between lobular and septal panniculitis, with each form further categorized according to the presence of vasculitis [18] . Lobular panniculitis without vasculitis, previously known as Weber-Christian disease in humans, is now known as systemic nodular panniculitis. This condition is an uncommon clinical entity and rarely causes or occurs concurrent with death in felines [7] . In cases where death has been attributed to fatal systemic nodular panniculitis, necropsy has revealed widespread involvement of the adipose tissues, including the panniculus; mesenteric, omental, and retroperitoneal adipose tissue; and the intestinal mucosa [15] . Systemic symptoms such as fever, nausea, vomiting, malaise, and arthropathy usually accompany systemic nodular panniculitis and may persist for several weeks or months [22] .",

Similar nodules were also observed within the intraperitoneal fat tissues, including the omental, mesenteric, and perirenal fat. The intraperitoneal nodules were irregular and varied in size from 0.5-10 cm in diameter. The nodules varied in color doi: 10.1292/jvms.17-0262 from red-brown to pale yellow foci resembling fat necrosis, and the cut surface of the nodules was red-gray to pale yellow ( Fig. 1 ).

Sterile nodular panniculitis (SNP) is an idiopathic disorder that presents as concurrent inflammation of fat in the abdomen, epidural space, and bone [5, 6] . SNP has been reported in humans, cats, and dogs, but this is the first known case of SNP in a Siberian tiger. In humans, the disease is characterized by the development of peculiar inflammatory nodules or swellings in the subcutaneous tissue, frequently in the lower extremities, accompanied by constitutional symptoms. In cases of dogs with necrotizing panniculitis, suppurate and granulomatous inflammation associated with the areas of necrosis and pyogranulomatous panniculitis have been observed.",

Microbial examination was performed, and the bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures were negative. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to detect canine distemper virus and feline coronavirus RNA in the lymph node samples, and the results were negative. One of the histological features of the present case was variable inflammatory cell infiltration in the subcutaneous adipose tissue, including lymphocytes; plasma cells; and pleomorphic, lipid-laden macrophages. The lung was also infiltrated by the same types of inflammatory cells, and lipid infiltration was observed in the alveolar space. Although the mesenteric lymph nodes were also involved, the lung involvement likely led to the patient's death. Necrotic adipose and connective tissues, including the lung tissue, were followed by fibrosis. Lung involvement may cause a variety of clinical signs, including difficulty breathing, coughing, and the syndrome may not be recognized through respiratory signs.",

The histopathological findings in the present case are similar to previously reported cases [12] . As an idiopathic disorder, SNP may occur as a primary disease or may be associated with any number of other illnesses [7, 16, 17, 19] . A wide variety of causes can induce SNP, including trauma, infection, foreign bodies, vitamin E or other nutritional deficiency, drug eruption, insect bite, and neoplasia [16, 17] . It has also been suggested that panniculitis can be classified based on the presence or absence of systemic symptoms. Panniculitis without systemic disease results from trauma or cold; panniculitis with systemic disease is typically due to collagen vascular disease, pancreatic disease, or lymphoproliferative disorders [9] . Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency is also a major cause of panniculitis in humans [20] . In the present case, no physical or chemical agents were evident in the clinical history. We did not find any evidence of trauma, and infection was excluded based on the laboratory test results. Nutritional (vitamin E) deficiency, insect bite, and autoimmune disorder, alone or in combination appear to be the leading causes of SNP. Notably, a previous report demonstrated that subcutaneous injection of the rabies vaccine was associated with focal necrotizing granulomatous panniculitis in cats and dogs [8] ; however, the present case was not vaccinated, which excludes this particular etiology.",
