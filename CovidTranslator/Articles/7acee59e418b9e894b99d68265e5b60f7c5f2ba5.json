The replication rates and transmissibility of viruses are two major factors that underlie this threat. However, at least one additional factor plays an essential role: the lack of 'broad-spectrum' antiviral agents. Indeed, while bacteria can still cause substantial epidemics in parts of the world where access to clean water and/ or antimicrobials is limited, the pandemic threats posed by bacteria, such as from the plague-causing Yersinia pestis, has been substantially diminished in the antibiotic era [1] . For viruses that pose epidemic risks, on the other hand, current therapeutic options are more limited.",

Thus, antiviral strategies must be directed at the virus specifically with care to avoid interfering with host cellular function. As such, the number of clear targets per virus may be limited. By contrast, bacterial protein synthesis, for example, occurs via ribosomes that belong to the bacteria and are disparate enough from human ribosomes in identity that specific antibiotics can be deployed to target only bacterial protein synthesis. This unique feature of viruses, which derives from their very nature, serves to delimit antiviral therapies in a manner not applicable to antibacterial therapies.",

Acylovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir are nucleoside analogs dependent on the virally encoded thymidine kinase enzyme for activity. There are separate specifically targeted antivirals such as ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, or letermovir (this last is itself exquisitely targeted at just CMV) to be used in the treatment and prophylaxis of CMV. The tenuous nature of any rudimentary claim to broad-spectrum antiviral activity is also evident in acyclovir's 10-fold drop in activity against HZV compared to fellow viral family members HSV-1 and 2, despite targeting the same enzymatic function (thymidine kinase) [2, 3] .",

Many HCV polymerase (NS5B) inhibitors and NS5A inhibitors are similarly constrained in spectrum of activity to specific HCV viral proteins encoded by specific genotypesfor example ledipasivir is only active against genotype 1though a pan-genotypic combination regimen has been developed [8] . However, there is always the specter of new HCV genotypes evolving which may have less susceptibility to these agents [9] . Influenza antivirals (available in the US) are also highly targeted with adamantane (amantadine and rimantadine) class antivirals effective only against influenza A.

This fact, coupled with the inherent and unique challenges with viral class pathogens, will make broad spectrum antiviral agent development difficult. However, as many antiviral agents might be amenable to repurposing and some (favipiravir, ribavirin, cidofovir, and brincidofovir) have already shown broad-spectrum properties, the task is not impossible.",

Antivirals in development against specific targets should also be systematically assessed for broad-spectrum antiviral activity. Lastly, identifying targets common to distinct viral families that are genetically similar would also be of great use in antiviral drug development. The broad-spectrum strategy should be pursued as a complement to (not in lieu of) the pursuit of targeted therapies such as monoclonal antibodies which also hold great promise for treating specific viral infection as evidenced by the successful deployment of monoclonal antibody products against Ebola, Hendra, Nipah, and hopeful future successes against HIV and influenza [35, 36] .",

By contrast, nearly every novel viral epidemic of regional or global importance has been characterized by the common refrain that supportive care is the mainstay of therapy with drug trials coming, for the most part, post-outbreak.
