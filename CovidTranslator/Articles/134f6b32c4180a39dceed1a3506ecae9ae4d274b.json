HPV58 is the third most common HPV genotype in China after HPV16 and HPV18. HPV E6 and E7 are oncoproteins and are constitutively expressed in HPV-associated cancer cells, therefore they are considered to be ideal target antigens for immunotherapy, including HPV therapeutic vaccine. In the present study, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope peptides were predicted and screened from HPV58 E7 antigen and their immunogenicity was subsequently determined. A total of 6 HLA-A2-binding peptides derived from HPV58 E7 were predicted and selected using 3 different prediction programs. A negative control peptide and PBS were used as two negative controls. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with HLA-A2(+) allele were used to detect the specific cellular immune response among the 6 predicted peptides by enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISOPT). Following preliminary screening for the predicted peptides , the antigenicity of the peptide HPV58 E7 72-80 was further assessed by an immunoassay to a vaccine contained HPV58 E7 antigen. Specific humoral and cellular immunity were detected using the peptide HPV58 E7 72-80 as the specific antigen. A total of 6 peptides from HPV58 E7 protein were predicted and subsequently",

High risk human papilloma virus (HPV) has been confirmed as a dominant factor responsible for several anogenital diseases, particularly cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma (1) . Of the more than two hundred HPV genotypes, 16, 18, 31, 45 , 52 and 58 are six particularly important, as they are highly correlated with more than 90% of cervical carcinoma cases (2) (3) (4) . Persistent infection with high risk HPV is the primary factor responsible for cervical cancer (3, 4) . Although strains 16 and 18 are the two most common high-risk HPV genotypes worldwide, genotype distribution studies in Chinese women have shown that HPV58 is the third most common genotype found in Chinese cervical carcinoma patients after HPV16 and -18 (5) . Because HPV58 infection is not common in western countries, current domestic and foreign research on HPV58 is lacking. However, the high rate of HPV58 infection in China firmly indicates that studies investigating HPV58 therapeutic vaccines are necessary.",

Many studies have showed that sustained expression of oncoproteins E7 is necessary for the tumorigenicity and development of cervical cancer cells (8, 9) . Accordingly, HPV E7 could be applied as target antigens for a candidate HPV therapeutic vaccine due to their constitutive expression and the maintenance of cellular transformation in HPV-infected cells (3) . Because of continuous E7 expression, it is impossible that cervical carcinoma cells can invoke immunologic escape through antigen loss (3) .

At present, this type of vaccine has become the focus of research in the immunization field. Recently, researchers have found that the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitope of the HPV16 E6 and E7 oncoproteins match human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A2, which is currently considered the most common human major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I molecule; the immunogenicity of these epitope has been confirmed using transgenic mice (11) . In vitro, lymphocytes from human peripheral blood previously immunized with the HPV16 polypeptide vaccine induced specific CTL immune responses and killed HPV16-positive tumor cells (12, 13) . However, the CTL epitope for HPV58 has not been found. In view of the high HPV58 infection rate in China, we attempted to find specific CTL epitope antigens in the HPV58 E7 proteins and to prepare corresponding polypeptide vaccines to treat cervical cancer.",

At present, studies evaluating HPV therapeutic polypeptide vaccines have focused on the HPV E6 and E7 proteins and their CTL epitope (14) . The HPV E6 and E7 proteins contain multiple CTL epitope that have high affinity for HLA class I molecules. Therefore, we can identify epitope peptides with both strong immunogenicity and high specificity (15) . This process is key for the preparation of HPV therapeutic polypeptide vaccines. Despite the high HPV58 infection rate in south China, where HPV58 is third after HPV16 and 18, the HPV58 infection rate is very low in western countries; moreover, HPV58 infection distribution differs by region. Research and development of HPV58 peptide vaccines has not received much attention because no accepted CTL epitope has been identified to date. Thus, the study and development of related therapeutic vaccines are difficult.",

Effector T cells mainly recognize CTL epitopes that are bound to MHC-I molecules to induce cytotoxic cytotoxicity (16) . HLA-I molecules are key to antigen presentation and activation of T cells. It is very important for the antigen presentation of virus antigen, tumor antigen, and so on. HLA-A2 is the most specific HLA-I molecule. Its distribution has significant ethnic, ethnic and geographical differences. Studies have shown that the frequency of allele distribution varies from 10 to 40% in different ethnic groups. HLA-A2 (+) accounts for approximately 53% of Chinese population (17) .

Therefore, it is important to study the HPV58 E6 and E7 HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope peptide in Chinese population. At present, some HLA-A2 (+) CTL epitopes in HPV16 E7 protein, such as E7 [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] and E7 49-57, have been identified and accepted (18) (19) (20) . At present, many studies have confirmed the effectiveness of these epitopes as antigen targets (21) (22) (23) (24) . However, there are few studies about HPV58. Chan identified three HLA-A11-restricted HPV58 E7 peptides (amino acid positions 78 to 86, 74 to 82, and 88 to 96) showed a positive response, but without HLA-A2-restricted E7 peptides (25) . Sabah confirmed the peptide region for the E7 protein ranged from27 to 33amino acids and a 9-m epitopes, SSDEDEIGL, in HPV58 E7 were the most potential T cell epitope. And the peptide sequences could interact with as many as seven MHC-1 alleles and showed population coverage up to 90.31% (26) . The CTL epitope for the HPV E6 and E7 antigens were screened by acid elution or the use of synthetic overlapping peptides. However, these two methods are costly and time consuming; additionally, the methods can result in a high miss rate because four to eight amino acid residues are separated by two overlapping peptide segments. Time and money can be saved by using internationally recognized epitope prediction sites. Therefore, in our study, HPV58 E7 HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope peptides were predicte d using several related websites: the HLA binding peptide prediction website HLA Peptide Binding Predictions, http://www-bimas.cit.nih. gov/molbio/hla_bind/; SYFPEITH, http://www.syfpeithi.de/; and epitope prediction and analysis tools, http://tools.immune epitope.org/main/ (27) . After a comprehensive analysis, we preliminarily identified 6 CTL antigen peptides in HPV58 E7 that were subsequently named P1 (E7 7-15 : TLREYILDL), P2 (E7 [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] : DLHPEPTDL), P3 (E7 69-77 : CINSTTTDV), and P4 (E7 72-80 : STTTDVRTL), P5 (E7 79-87 : TLQQLLMGT), P6 (E7 83-91 : LLMGTCTIV).",

In the evaluation of HPV58 E7 peptide-specific T cell immunity in HLA-A2 (+) human PBMC, IFN-\u03b3-production was evident by ELISPOT assay in the P2 and P4 groups. The average numbers of IFN-\u03b3-positive spots in groups P2 and P4 were significantly increased compared to other four experiment groups and the two negative control groups. And P4 showed the strongest response. Therefore, we chose P4 (E7 72-80 : STTTDVRTL) to continue our study. To be viewed as good peptide epitope, a particular sequence must have some key properties. Firstly, the epitope has to be fairly well conserved among HPV's proteome. Secondly, the epitope has capacity that ensures processivity. In addition, the processed peptide has to be able to interact with MHC alleles, and finally the interacting MHC allele should have good population coverage. E7 72-80 was chose from HPV58 E7 conserved sequence and fulfilled all the parameters mentioned here.",

In cellular immunoassays, the average number of IFN-\u03b3-positive spots in the AD-HPV16/18/58 mE6E7 vaccine group wa significantly enhanced compared with PBS group and AD-NC group.

Another limitation of peptide-based vaccines is the need to match the patient's HLA that makes it difficult to develop a peptide-based vaccine applicable to the whole population. HPV58 E7 72-80 is a HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitope peptide and has good antigenicity. HLA-A2 (+) accounts for more than 50% of Chinese population. Therefore, this result provided a potential target epitope for HPV58 E7 protein and lay the foundation for the construction and identification of HPV58 peptide vaccines.",
