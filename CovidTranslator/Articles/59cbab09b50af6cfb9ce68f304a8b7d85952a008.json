Various viral proteins perform counter-defensive functions, but a distinct class, called security proteins, is dedicated specifically to counteracting host defences. Here, the properties of the picornavirus security proteins L and 2A are discussed. These proteins have well-defined positions in the viral polyprotein, flanking the capsid precursor, but they are structurally and biochemically unrelated. Here, we consider the impact of these two proteins, as well as that of a third security protein, L*, on viral reproduction, pathogenicity and evolution. The concept of security proteins could serve as a paradigm for the dedicated counter-defensive proteins of other viruses.",

RNA viruses encoding only a capsid and an RdRP are known to infect protists such as Giardia spp. 3 . Some RNA phages and fungal RNA viruses express only three proteins. However, most RNA viruses do not rely on such a scant protein repertoire. The proteomes of the majority of RNA viruses comprise up to 12 different proteins, with the genomes of some coronaviruses encoding nearly 30 proteins.",

Thus, viral infection requires not only replication but also interactions with host defences. To carry out these tasks, RNA viruses have only a few proteins at their disposal, with the available protein arsenal being limited by the genome size. As the proteomes of these viruses are strikingly small and specific viral functions generally require more than one protein, most proteins encoded by RNA viruses are multi functional. At the same time, however, there is a certain division of labour between viral proteins. We consider some aspects of this problem using, as an example, the picornaviruses, a large family of small animal viruses with a medium-sized, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (BOX 1) . Although they share a common genome organization, these viruses exhibit sufficient genetic variation to be separated into at least 12 distinct genera (BOX 2) . The family includes important human and animal pathogens that cause a range of disorders, including poliomyelitis, foot-and-mouth disease, the common cold, gastroenteritis, hepatitis, meningitis, myocarditis and uveitis. In addition to acute diseases, these viruses can also cause chronic persistent disorders.",

Functionally, these proteins (L, L* and 2A) have been characterized in some detail for only a few picornaviruses, and in these cases their major function has been shown to be counteracting host defences, thereby ensuring optimal conditions for viral reproduction. In this Review we argue that picornaviral L and 2A proteins that have yet to be characterized are likely to fulfil the same biological role.",

They are sometimes also referred to as virulence factors 6 ; such a designation, although it may be more familiar, is somewhat less preferable to us for the reasons explained below. Viruses have no special 'desire' to be virulent, that is, to harm, even less to kill, their hosts. The pathogenic properties of a virus are not a prerequisite for viral fitness. In fact, the most severe harm in a viral infection comes not from viral reproduction but from the (sometimes miscalculated) host defence response. Host damaging or even suicidal defensive reactions include RNA degradation, inhibition of translation, and the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, autophagy and inflammation, and these reactions are aimed at limiting viral reproduction and spread. As a natural response, viruses have evolved tools directed not only at overcoming the specific innate and adaptive immune responses but also at inhibiting the general host metabolic functions on which these specific defences are based -that is, processes such as transcription and translation, cell signalling and intracellular trafficking. Inhibiting these processes is the major function of the security proteins. Accordingly, the capacity to withstand host defences, rather than virulence (the ability to harm the host) per se, is the property that is selected for during viral evolution. The long-term co-evolution of a virus and its host will probably result in their mutual adaptation accompanied by a decrease in viral virulence. Thus, in our opinion, the term 'security protein' is a better reflection of the evolutionary origin of the relevant proteins than the term 'virulence factor' . moreover, the possession of efficient security proteins does not necessarily make a virus particularly virulent.",

Although certain sapeloviruses seem to express two L proteins (Supplementary information S1 (figure)), approximately half the picorna virus genera lack L altogether. The length of 2A varies ~30-fold (from 9 residues in senecaviruses to ~300 residues in avihepatoviruses and some sapeloviruses), and it can comprise one to three separate polypeptides. The L proteins of cardioviruses and klasseviruses are strongly acidic and markedly basic, respectively, whereas the 2A proteins of these viruses exhibit the reverse ratio of acidity. The overall charge of the proteins will influence the choice of their interaction partners.

The RNA is packaged into an icosahedral capsid usually composed of four distinct proteins (VP1-VP4), but in some viruses VP4 and VP2 are fused (forming VP0). After productive contacts with specific cellular receptors, which differ between viruses, the genome is uncoated and enters the cytoplasm, where the main steps of viral reproduction occur. The viral RNA, which contains a single ORF (with one exception described in the main text), is translated in a cap-independent manner into a 2,200-2,500 amino acid polypeptide, which is eventually processed by limited proteolysis into a dozen 'mature' proteins. These proteins include: capsid proteins; an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D pol ); a protein (VPg, or 3B) that serves as a primer for the initiation of RNA synthesis; an ATPase with a conserved superfamily 3 helicase motif (2C ATPase ) and an essential but poorly defined role in viral RNA replication; a chymotrypsin-like protease (3C pro ), which, as the mature protein or as a precursor, is a major factor in polyprotein processing; two hydrophobic membrane-binding proteins (2B and 3A) that participate in the generation of a virus-friendly environment; and, flanking the precursor of the capsid proteins, one or two highly variable proteins (L and 2A), the structure and functions of which are the subject of this Review. The entire coding region of the RNA is surrounded with untranslated regions (UTRs) harbouring regulatory elements that control viral translation (for example, the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)) and replication (the origins oriL and oriR), and this entire RNA sequence is flanked by the covalently linked viral protein VPg and a poly(A) tract at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini, respectively.

One could perhaps argue that such effects of security proteins contradict the key proposal of this Review that these proteins are dedicated to counter-defensive functions. However, as already mentioned, inflicting harm on their hosts does not bring viruses any benefits per se. The only reason (or at least, the main reason) why viruses evolved the ability to damage infected cells is their need to incapacitate the cellular defensive machinery. This machinery includes several specific mechanisms (such as innate and adaptive immunity), the implementation of which requires general cellular functions such as translation, transcription and controllable nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Therefore, virus-induced impairment of these all-purpose metabolic functions can be regarded as a component of the viral counter-defensive strategy.",

The replacement of L in the full-length cardiovirus genome with FmDV L pro generates a virus that can overcome host defences more efficiently than its leaderless counterpart, although it has lower fitness 92, 93 . Such interchangeability of structurally and biochemically distinct proteins attests to the similarity of their biological functions. It is hardly by chance that viruses that encode long or multiple Ls tend to have a short 2A or lack 2A altogether (assuming that 2A sp is not a security protein), and vice versa (FIG. 1) . For example, simian and porcine sapeloviruses harbour a long 2A and a short L, whereas avian sapelovirus encodes the longest L identified to date and the predicted 2A ORF is very short, if it encodes a protein at all. This tendency is consistent with the notion that L and 2A have similar roles in virus-host interactions. As already mentioned, some picornaviruses, for example, cosaviruses, encode no security proteins. even viruses that do encode security proteins can, under certain circumstances, survive and replicate after these proteins have been inactivated or eliminated. Notably, cardiovirus L 31, 48, 77, 78 and L* (REFS 34, 81, 94) and FmDV L pro (REF. 95) are not essential for viral viability, and extended deletions in 2A of cardioviruses 42, 79 and hepatitis A virus 96, 97 do not kill these viruses. Furthermore, although some data suggest that poliovirus 2A pro has an essential replicative function 98 , recent experiments have demonstrated its dispensability for viral viability 86 .",

It can be speculated that the most ancient of the 2A molecules are the 2A sp peptides, as hinted by their presence in most picornavirus genera, including those belonging to different lineages (FIG. 2) . Interruption of polyprotein synthesis after translation of the capsid proteins might be advantageous for viral reproduction. It might, for example, facilitate proper protein folding, ensure optimal kinetics of protein synthesis or control the ratios of structural to non-structural proteins, which could theoretically be achieved by incomplete translational re-initiation at the second proline residue of the NPG(P) motif. It is worth noting that there is a difference in the translation factor requirements for translation of the emCV polyprotein upstream and downstream of the 2A-2B boundary 121 . Strikingly, 2A sp peptides -or more accurately, the DXeXNPG(P) motifs (where X is any amino acid) that are characteristic of these peptides -are found in some other picorna-like and unrelated viruses, where they seem to serve the same function [122] [123] [124] . Assuming that the acquisition of NPG(P) was an early event, this motif might have been lost by some parechoviruses (and other picornaviruses) at a certain step of evolution 21 . In contrast to picornaviruses, the acquisition of 2A sp by members of some other families of RNA viruses has been proposed to have occurred at a late stage 122 . The idea that these peptides might have originated in picornaviruses is an attractive hypothesis. The NPG(P) motif can also be found in several cellular proteins, but the current data do not allow researchers to determine whether the recoding ability of this motif was a viral or cellular invention.",

This is illustrated in FIG. 3 , which summarizes the properties of the three best studied security proteins. The biological functions of enterovirus 2A pro and cardiovirus L are strikingly similar: inhibition of host macromolecular synthesis, permeabilization of the nuclear envelope and inhibition of active nucleocytoplasmic transport, suppression of specific innate immunity mechanisms and control of the apoptotic machinery of the host cells.

There is a striking similarity between the functional activities of the enterovirus 2A protease (2A pro ) and the cardiovirus leader protein (L), but the underlying mechanisms by which these functions are carried out are fundamentally different. By contrast, the known functional activities of aphthovirus L, which is a protease (L pro ), seem to be more limited.

Nevertheless, the data discussed here allow us to provisionally assign security functions even to those L and 2A proteins that have not yet been characterized.

            "text": "Viruses with large DNA genomes possess impressive arsenals of security proteins. The complement of security proteins is much more limited in RNA viruses but is sufficient for their evolutionary success. There are also tentative examples of security proteins in non-picornavirus RNA viruses. Coronaviruses have several so-called accessory proteins, which are neither conserved nor essential and exhibit the capacity to suppress host innate immunity by a range of mechanisms 128 . Some, but not all, flaviviruses use ribosome frame shifting to express a non-essential non-structural protein, NS1\u2032, mutational inactivation of which results in viral attenuation 129 . The NSS protein of the Rift Valley fever phlebovirus suppresses the interferon system, and its inactivation does not kill the virus but attenuates its pathogenicity 130 . This list can readily be extended.",

            "text": "The spectrum of picornavirus-induced diseases is extraordinarily broad. The reasons for this variability are poorly understood, although receptor compatibility and effects on viral protein and RNA synthesis that are caused by differences in the availability of host factors are surely important contributors. However, the interaction between host defences and viral counterdefence is certainly one of the key factors underlying the pathogenicity of picornaviruses and other viruses. This interaction cannot be fully understood without elucidation of the roles of the security proteins. Treatment and prevention of viral diseases may also markedly benefit from such elucidation. The study of security proteins is therefore an underdeveloped but highly promising research area.",

There is great variability in L and 2A proteins. Multiple L and 2A proteins are known for some viral genera. Several picornaviruses do not possess L but have large 2A proteins. Cosaviruses contain no L and only a very short 2A. Other viruses (for example, some sapeloviruses) possess an unusually long L (we propose that in this case it might correspond to at least two separate polypeptides; see Supplementary information S1 (figure)) and a very short 2A (if there is a 2A peptide at all). Remarkably, other sapeloviruses possess a long 2A and a short L. Notable differences in the organization of the L and 2A proteins can occur among representatives of the same genus, such as in cardioviruses and parechoviruses.

The distribution of security proteins among different viruses is not congruent with either the type of internal ribosome entry site (IRES; the key cis-acting element responsible for cap-independent translation of picornavirus RNAs) or the topology of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) tree. For example, viruses harbouring type II IRESs can possess different L proteins (aphthoviruses and cardioviruses) or be devoid of this protein (cosaviruses). A similar situation occurs with viruses that use type IV IRESs. Conversely, different kobuviruses can possess unrelated IRESs. 2A proteins with the H-NC motif are present in viruses of distant RdRP lineages (kobuviruses on the one hand and avihepatoviruses, parechoviruses and tremoviruses on the other), but this motif is not shared by more closely related viruses (for example, it is present in tremoviruses but absent in hepatoviruses). The same pattern is characteristic of the 2A proteins that contain the NPG(P) motif (which interrupts translation at the indicated proline residue; shown by P\u2193). The closely related seal picornavirus type 1 (SePV-1), duck hepatitis A virus (DHV), Ljungan virus (LV) and human parechovirus type 2 (HPeV-2) each harbour a distinct 2A protein. Well-defined amino acid motifs are indicated. Viral RdRP protein sequences were taken from GenBank. Multiple alignments of protein sequences were constructed using CLUSTAL-X2.
