During this same time there has been an unprecedented display of international scientific cooperation, and the discovery of a previously unknown virus. It sounds so implausible-mystery disease spreads around-the-world in a matter of weeks, an organism that infects the health care provider but tends to spare children. Truth really can be stranger than fiction.",

Public health methods that were used for epidemics of smallpox and cholera (ie, quarantine and isolation) in the 19 th century had to be used to slow the progression of infection in the 21st century. Modern hospitals were not able to stop the spread of SARS and actually became a significant source of infection. Patients tended to fare no better but perhaps did worse when given powerful antiviral medications. In less than 1 month, SARS quickly became an international danger.",

The Chinese symbol for \"crisis\" is made up of the symbols for \"danger\" and \"opportunity.\" We know of the dangers of SARS and are learning of the opportunities. The general public and healthcare providers in industrialized countries have become complacent about the ability to prevent infectious disease. We tend to worry and focus on the obscure bioterrorist agents more than the common cold. Ironically, the SARS virus is a variant of the coronavirus, which causes the common cold. There is still a need to increase public health surveillance and control measures that work against all infectious agents. SARS has taught us that any common virus can mutate and travel overnight to international destinations.",

Over the last year there has been no shortage of other disasters or efforts to make disaster response a rational effort. In each issue, we work to present the newest lessons learned and the authors and reviewers of this issue have done more of the same. They worked with impossible publishing deadlines to provide first-hand experience, share research and to create a forum for information exchange. It is a start and with each contribution we build on our collective knowledge of SARS and other issues. Disaster Management & Response will continue to work to meet the unexpected needs of patients and healthcare providers and to help decipher the unimaginable.",
