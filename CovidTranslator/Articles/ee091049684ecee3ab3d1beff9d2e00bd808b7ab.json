Currently there is no cure for rabies once clinical signs appear. It is believed that once RABV enters the central nervous system (CNS), virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) in the periphery cannot pass through the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) and into the CNS. Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that VNAs produced in the CNS by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then transported into the CNS, are important in clearing RABV from the CNS. In the present study, mouse serum containing VNA was administered intravenously into mice after infection with wild-type RABV. Our studies demonstrate that exogenous administration of VNAs is crucial in the clearance of RABV from the brain and prevent the development of rabies in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice as long as the BBB permeability remains enhanced. This present study therefore provides a foundation for the possibility of developing VNA therapy for clinical rabies in humans.",

            "text": "Rabies virus (RABV) is a negative-sense and single-stranded RNA virus which belongs to the Lyssavirus genus of the Rhabdoviridae family (Rupprecht, 1996) . Rhabdoviruses are enveloped with a typical bullet-or rod-shaped morphology and characterized by an extremely broad host spectrum ranging from plants to insects to mammals (Rupprecht, 1996) . Rabies has been known as a deadly neurological disease of both humans and animals for centuries (Jackson, 2002) and remains a major threat to public health (Jackson, 2013b; Knobel et al., 2005; Martinez, 2000; Meslin et al., 1994) . Each year rabies causes more than 55,000 human deaths around the world (Meslin et al., 1994) . Canine rabies is responsible for more than 99% of the human cases in Asia and Africa (Cleaveland et al., 2006) . In the United States, dog rabies has been largely brought under control through pet vaccination programs and the number of human cases has declined dramatically during the past 60 years (Hampson et al., 2009 ). Most of the human cases in the USA have been associated with RABV found in bats, particularly the silver-haired bats with no obvious recognized exposure history (Messenger et al., 2003; Morimoto et al., 1996) . Therefore, there is a need to develop therapeutics for clinical rabies although rabies can be prevented in humans after exposure (usually after an animal bite) by post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), which is comprised of wound cleansing, vaccination and administration of anti-rabies immunoglobulin. PEP is very effective if it is initiated promptly after exposure (CDC, 2010) . It is widely accepted that there is no effective treatment for rabies infection which is almost always fatal once neurological symptoms develop (WHO, 1992; Wilde, 2007) . Although 2009; Willoughby et al., 2005) , its effectiveness has been questioned (Hemachudha et al., 2006; Jackson, 2013a; McDermid et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "Rabies clinical signs, especially neurologic signs, are believed to be indicative of virus replication resulting in neuronal dysfunction or injury in the central nervous system (CNS), where peripheral immune effectors have limited access (Yousaf et al., 2012) . Viral infection of the CNS poses unique challenges to the immune system with regards to controlling and eliminating the invading pathogens (Griffin, 2003) . The presence of a blood-brain barrier (BBB) provides a physical and physiological separation of the CNS from the periphery and thus cells and molecules cannot easily enter the CNS (Ballabh et al., 2004; Hosking and Lane, 2010; Roy and Hooper, 2008) . Although enhancement of BBB permeability and infiltration of inflammatory cells have often been associated with pathological changes in the CNS when infected by viruses (Hosking and Lane, 2010; Kim et al., 2009; Phares et al., 2006) , transiently increased BBB permeability has been found to be helpful in clearing RABV from the CNS . Induction of an autoimmune CNS inflammation (experimental allergic encephalomyelitis) or administration of attenuated RABV (CVS-F3) (Phares et al., 2006) as well as recombinant RABV expressing three copies of the glycoprotein (G) (TriGAS) (Faber et al., 2009) or immune stimulating molecules (for example, GM-CSF) Wen et al., 2011) all resulted in enhancement of BBB permeability, increased production of virus neutralizing antibodies (VNAs), clearance RABV from the CNS, and prevention of rabies in the mouse model. Furthermore, clearance of attenuated RABV from the CNS correlates with infiltration of B cells into the CNS, expressing high levels of j-light chain mRNA (Phares et al., 2006) . Passively-transferred VNA via intraperitoneal route was insufficient to mediate the CNS clearance of attenuated RABV in B-cell deficient mice . These observations led to the hypothesis that it is the VNA produced in situ (CNS) by invading B cells, rather than those produced in the periphery and then crossed into the CNS, that are important in clearing RABV from the CNS . Nevertheless, it has been reported that enhancing BBB permeability with delivering sufficient VNA to the brain may provide an effective treatment after the CNS infection has been established (Liao et al., 2012) . In the present study, intravenous administration of VNA was found to be crucial in clearing RABV from the brain and preventing animals from developing rabies in both immunocompetent and B-cell deficient mice as long as the BBB permeability is enhanced.",

Total RNA was extracted from brain homogenates using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Redwood, CA) and treated with DNase (Qiagen). The reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase were utilized from a one-step Brilliant II SYBR green qRT-PCR master mix kit (Stratagene). Each reaction was carried out in duplicate with approximately 100 ng of DNase-treated RNA and 5 nM each primer pairs described previously (Armstrong et al., 2012; Braniste et al., 2009; Faber et al., 2002; Phares et al., 2006) . Amplification was carried out at 50\u00b0C for 2 min and 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles in two steps: 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. For absolute quantification of viral genomic RNA, a standard curve was generated by using a serially diluted RNA in vitro transcribed from a plasmid expressing RABV G, and the copy numbers of viral genomic RNA were normalized to 1 g of total RNA. For measurement of the mRNA for tight junction proteins and j-light chain, the copy numbers were normalized to those of the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Levels of gene expression in a test sample are presented as the fold increase over that detected in sham-infected controls.",

To investigate if intravenous administration of VNA together with MCP-1 can protect mice from RABV infection, 4-6 week-old ICR mice were infected intramuscularly (biceps femoris muscle of left hindlimb) with 10 IMLD50 (50% mouse intramuscular lethal dose) of a street RABV (DRV-Mexico) as described . At 5 days post infection (dpi), mice were treated intravenously from the tail vein with 150 ll of RABV-negative serum or RABV-antibody positive serum (VNA titer: 8 IU). To enhance the BBB permeability, mice were treated intracerebrally with 25 lg recombinant murine MCP-1 (suspended in 40 ll of sterile ddH 2 O), which is known to transiently enhance the BBB permeability (Stamatovic et al., 2005) . Mice were observed daily for 3 weeks for the development of rabies and the results are shown in Fig. 1 . All infected mice treated with medium only died by day 14 p.i. Only 10% of the mice survived after treatment with the combination of MCP-1 and RABVnegative serum or with the positive serum alone without MCP-1.

To ensure that intravenously adminis-tered RABV VNAs are able to reach the brain after BBB permeability is enhanced by MCP-1, ICR mice were given RABV-antibody positive serum intravenously with or without MCP-1 and the antibody levels were analyzed 24 h later in both the brain and the serum. The results are depicted in Fig. 3 . The level of VNAs was found to be similar in the serum of mice with or without MCP-1 treatment (Fig. 3B ) while the VNA levels in the brains of mice treated with RABV-antibody positive serum in conjunction with MCP-1 were significantly higher ($0.3 IU) than in mice treated with VNA-positive serum without MCP-1 (<0.1 IU) (Fig. 3A) .

VNA levels in both the brain and serum continued to be significant at 10 and 15 dpi in mice treated with MCP-1 and RABV-antibody positive serum while VNAs remained undetectable in mice treated with MCP-1 but without RABV-antibody positive serum (Fig. 5A ). These mice developed severe signs of rabies. On the other hand, no significant differences were observed in IgG levels in the brain and serum between DRVinfected mice treated with MCP-1 with or without RABV-antibody positive serum ( Fig. 5C and D) . IgG levels in the brains peaked immediately 12 h after administration which correlates with the timing of BBB permeability being enhanced by MCP-1 (Fig. 5C ). Together, these results suggest that wt RABV fails to elicit VNA responses and passively-transferred RABV-antibody positive serum along with MCP-1 is needed for mice to maintain a protective VNA level in the brain.",

In contrast, viral genomic RNA gradually decreased in the brains of mice infected with DRV-Mexico and treated with MCP-1 and RABV-antibody positive serum. Similar results were also observed for virus titers (data not shown). The decrease in virus copy numbers and titers corresponds to the increase of VNA in the brain. At 10 dpi, virus copy number in the brain of mice treated with RABV-negative serum was 1000 times more than in mice treated with RABV-antibody positive serum. Similar virus copy numbers were detected in the brains of mice infected with DVR-Mexico and treated with MCP-1 alone and those without any treatment at 10 dpi. By 15 dpi (10 days after treatment), virus was no longer detectable in the surviving mice treated with MCP-1 and RABV-antibody positive serum. These findings indicated that MCP-1 alone is not capable of clearing RABV from the brain. Instead, intravenous administration of VNA, in addition to MCP-1, is crucial in clearing RABV from the brain.",

Half of the mice were left untreated and the other half treated intravenously with RABV-antibody positive serum in conjunction with MCP-1 at 5 dpi. Without treatment (MCP-1 or VNA), B-cell deficient and C57BL/6J mice all died by 12-14 dpi (Fig. 6) . Eighty percent of the C57BL/6J mice treated with RABV-antibody positive serum and MCP-1 survived (Fig. 6 ) and jlight chain mRNA was detected in the CNS of surviving mice (Fig. 7D) . Only 25% of the B6.129S2-Ighm tm1Cgn /J mice survived when treated at day 5 after infection (Fig. 6 ) despite the fact that VNA titers were still high in the serum (Fig. 7C ). This might be due to the fact that VNA level declined 48 h after injection of MCP-1 (Fig. 5) . Thus additional dose of MCP-1 was given at day 7 after infection, which increased significantly (p < 0.05) the survival rate from 25% (MCP-1 given only at 5 dpi) to 78% (MCP-1 given at both 5 and 7 dpi) in B6.129S2-Ighm tm1Cgn /J mice (Fig. 6 ).

Unlike humans where RABVs may take weeks to reach the CNS from the site of exposure and cause clinical illness, the spread of RABVs to the CNS in mice is rapid with virus generally being detectable in CNS tissues within 48 h of infection (Hooper, 2005) . Clinical signs, particularly neurologic signs, are believed to indicate neuronal injury/dysfunction related to virus replication in CNS neurons. Hindlimb paralysis, a major neurological sign of rabies infection in mice, may not be the best endpoint for wt rabies infection in mice, especially given that infection of spinal neurons was believed to be the cause of hindlimb paralysis in infections with laboratory rabies strain (CVS-11). However, our previous studies demonstrated that the highest RABV titer was detected in the brains, at 9 dpi, right before RABV-infected mice develop hindlimb paralysis . Therefore, it was used as the humane endpoint in present this study to demonstrate the clearance of RABV from the CNS by passively transferred antibodies and also to minimize the suffering of the infected mice.

Thus, BBB plays an important role in maintaining the homeostasis in the CNS (Neuwelt, 2004) and enhancement of BBB permeability has often been associated with CNS diseases (Spindler and Hsu, 2012) . Some viruses, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and attenuated RABV, that infect the CNS can enhance the BBB permeability resulting in infiltration of inflammatory cells and pathological changes (Kim et al., 2009; Phares et al., 2006) . In wt RABV infection, however, BBB permeability is not enhanced since RABV bypasses the BBB and enter the CNS via axonal transport directly from the site of peripheral inoculation Roy and Hooper, 2008) . Enhancement of BBB permeability is thus required for immune effectors to enter into the CNS to clear RABV and prevent the occurrence of rabies (Phares et al., 2006; . To enhance the BBB permeability for RABV clearance from the CNS, lab-attenuated RABV (Phares et al., 2006) and recombinant RABV expressing three copies of G (Faber et al., 2009) or GM-CSF Wen et al., 2011) have been directly injected into the brain and were found to stimulate VNA production and enhance the BBB permeability, resulting in the clearance of RABV from the CNS and prevention of the development of rabies in the mouse model after infection with wt RABV.",

            "text": "MCP-1 has been reported to transiently enhance the BBB permeability in mice without causing obvious side effects (Stamatovic et al., 2005) and has been used to enhance the BBB permeability for RABV clearance in our previous studies . In the present study, the role of MCP-1 in enhancing the BBB permeability was investigated, including the dynamics of BBB permeability change, the level of RABV VNA in the brain, and the down-regulation of tight junction proteins in the brain vasculature. A single intracerebral dose of MCP-1 enhanced the BBB permeability significantly over the control mice. The enhancement reached a peak by 36 h, an observation similar to that previously reported (Stamatovic et al., 2005) . Administration of MCP-1 resulted in the reduction of TJ protein (occludin and claudin-5) expression in our studies. It has been known that enhancement of BBB permeability correlates with the reduction of TJ protein expression in the brain vasculature (Chai et al., 2014; Kirk et al., 2003; Kniesel and Wolburg, 2000; Liao et al., 2012) . Our results further support the functional role for the cytoplasmic anchorage of TJ particles for brain endothelial barrier function. VNA levels in the brains were also measured to evaluate whether the compromised BBB allows antibodies to leak into the brain. The possible interference of circulating antibodies, particularly VNAs, in brain vasculature was minimized by PBS perfusion before sample collection as previously described (Yu et al., 2011) . It is always possible that residual antibodies which did not pass the BBB may not be completely eliminated by perfusion. However, VNA in the brain was found to be significantly higher in mice treated with the combination of VNA and MCP-1 than in mice treated with VNA alone, which indicates that significantly more VNA passed through the BBB with MCP-1 treatment since the VNA level in the serum was similar in these animals. Therefore, enhancement of BBB permeability allowed intravenously administered VNA to pass through the BBB and into the brain which inhibited RABV replication, leading to eventual clearance of RABV from the brain and prevention of Fig. 7 . Virus titers and virus copy number in brains, serum VNA and the expression of j-light chain mRNA in brains of B-cell deficient mice treated with RABV-antibody positive serum and MCP-1 after infection with DRV. C57BL/6J and Ighm tm1Cgn (B-cell deficient) mice (groups of 8) at the age of 4-6 weeks were infected i.m. with 10 IMLD50 DRV and then treated with RABV-antibody positive serum (Ab) in conjunction with MCP-1 at 5 dpi or at both 5 and 7 dpi. Infected and treated mice were observed daily for 21 days. Both sera and brains were harvested once mice reached the criteria of euthanasia by developing paralysis in both hind legs (Dead) or survived through day 21 (Survived) for the determination of virus titers (A) and viral genomic RNA copy number (B) in brains, serum VNA (C) and j-light chain mRNA in brains (D). Data from groups of n P 3 mice are presented as mean values \u00b1 SEM, except for group e with only one C57BL/6J mouse dead. Asterisks indicate significant differences ( \u2044 p < 0.05, \u2044\u2044 p < 0.01, \u2044\u2044\u2044 p < 0.001) between the indicated experimental groups. ND: not done. the development of rabies. Without MCP-1, intravenously administered VNA cannot pass through the BBB to clear RABV in the brain and prevent the development of rabies. Enhancement of BBB permeability alone, however, cannot prevent the development of rabies in mice infected with wt RABV as has been demonstrated clearly in previous and this study. Although MCP-1 is capable of recruiting leukocytes into the CNS (Yadav et al., 2010) and intracerebral injection of MCP-1 may induce a localized inflammation secondary to the mechanical stimuli, MCP-1 (i.c.) alone or a combination of MCP-1 (i.c.) and negative serum (i.v.) is insufficient to clear wt RABV from the brain and prevent the development of rabies. These studies indicate that MCP-1 alone or mechanical stimuli of intracerebral injection does not lead to the clearance of RABV from the brain or increase survival.",

Hemachudha (1994) reported that less than 30% of the human rabies patients developed VNA at the time of death. In this present study, no VNA was detected in mice infected with DRV-Mexico and all mice died without any intervention. This finding further suggests that although non-VNA could be made in the brain, it does not contribute to survival during wt rabies infections. The mechanism by which wt RABV does not induce the production of VNA is not entirely clear at the moment and further studies are warranted.",

Passively transferred VNA via intraperitoneal route failed to clear attenuated RABV from the brain in B-cell deficient mice. However, our studies summarized here demonstrate a different result in the wt RABV-infected mouse model, which is likely more relevant to clinical rabies in humans. The intravenously administered VNA is important in clearing wt RABV from the brain and preventing the development of rabies not only in immunocompetent mice, but also in B-cell deficient mice as long as the BBB permeability remains enhanced. Thus production of VNA in situ (brain) by plasma cells is not absolutely required for wt RABV clearance from the brain. Similar results have also been reported for coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis. Although recruitment of virus-specific antibody-secreting cells (ASC) mediated by CXCR3 has been found helpful in controlling coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis (Marques et al., 2011; Phares et al., 2013) , viral recrudescence can be prevented in Bcell-deficient and IgM \u00c0/\u00c0 mice by intraperitoneal administrations of JHMV-specific neutralizing antibodies (Lin et al., 1999; Ramakrishna et al., 2003) . Thus these findings further demonstrate that production of VNA in situ (brain) by antibody-secreting cells (ASC) is not absolutely required for clearance of viruses from the brain.",

We attribute this to the transient nature of MCP-1 in enhancing the BBB permeability (Stamatovic et al., 2005) and the low level of VNA present in the brain ($0.3 IU) despite the fact that VNA level in the serum remains high (3-4 IU). Thus continued enhancement of BBB permeability is required for maintaining sufficient VNA level in the brain to clear RABV. It was speculated that B cell deficient mice could mediate non-antibody dependent antiviral mechanisms and thus play a role in the clearance of RABV from the brain. However, all mice died without being treated with RABV antibody-positive serum and more mice survived when treated with MCP-1 twice than those treated only once, further indicating that VNA passing into the brain from the periphery played a decisive role in clearing RABV from the brain in the B-cell deficient mice.",

Other vaccines, such as, live-attenuated RABV vaccine and recombinant vaccine expressing RABV G, are limited to use only in wildlife animals (Brochier et al., 1991; Hanlon et al., 1998; Schumacher et al., 1993) . Recent studies suggested that live-attenuated vaccines expressing multiple copies of the G or immune-stimulating molecules not only have the potential to replace the traditional inactivated RABV vaccines, but also can clear RABV from the CNS if administered intracerebrally (Faber et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2011) . However, intracerebral administration of live-attenuated or recombinant RABV still possesses safety concerns. Our results demonstrated that VNA can be administered by intravenous route and is crucial for RABV clearance from the brain before the appearance of clinical signs. It would be interesting to initiate the treatment after the appearance of clinical signs. However, there are still obstacles to overcome. For example, virus burden will increase and changes in neuronal injury/dysfunction may not be reversible at late stage of RABV infection. Thus further studies are warranted. Nevertheless, the findings presented in this study provide a foundation for developing VNA therapy for human clinical rabies.",
