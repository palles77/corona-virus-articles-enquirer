In this study, several nsps encoded by avian gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) were screened for RNA-binding activity and interaction with its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, nsp12. Nsp2, nsp5, nsp8, nsp9 and nsp10 were found to bind to untranslated regions (UTRs), while nsp8 was confirmed to interact with nsp12. Nsp8 has been reported to interact with nsp7 and functions as a primase synthesizing RNA primers for nsp12. Further characterization revealed that nsp8-nsp12 interaction is independent of the UTRs of viral RNA, and nsp8 interacts with both the N-and C-terminal regions of nsp12. These results have prompted a proposal of how the nsp7-nsp8 complex could possibly function in tandem with nsp12, forming a highly efficient complex that could synthesize both the RNA primer and viral RNA during coronavirus infection.",

These two processes are dependent upon viral ability to synthesize both the positive-sense genomic mRNA (gRNA) and a nested set of positive-sense sgRNAs. The key player in this part of the coronavirus life cycle is the virus-encoded replicase gene, which makes up two thirds of the genome and is translated into two polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab. The two polyproteins are then autoproteolytically processed into 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) by two virus-encoded proteases, the papain-like protease encoded in nsp3 and the 3C-like (main) protease encoded in nsp5 (Liu et al., 1994 (Liu et al., , 1997 Ng and Liu, 1998 , 2002 Lim and Liu, 1998; Lim et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2001; Fang et al., 2008; . Notably, due to the lack of a cleavage site that usually lies between nsp1 and nsp2 in other coronaviruses, cleavage of the IBV replicase only produces 15 nsps (nsp2-16) without the counterpart of nsp1. Based on sequence comparison, biochemical and structural studies, the enzymatic activities required for most of the key processes in coronavirus RNA synthesis have been mapped to some of the nsps (Pasternak et al., 2006) . Among them, the key enzyme critical to the viral ability to replicate its genome and propagate in the host cell is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) or nsp12. Available evidence suggests that the RNA polymerase activity of nsp12 may be primerdependent (te Velthuis et al., 2010) and require the primase activity of nsp8 (Imbert et al., 2006) . Other important enzymatic activities include the RNA helicase of nsp13 (Seybert et al., 2000; Ivanov et al., 2004a) , the methyltransferase activities of nsp14 and nsp16 (Y. Ma et al., 2015; Decroly et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2011; Bouvet et al., 2010) , the exoribonuclease activity of nsp14 (Ma et al., 2015; Minskaia et al., 2006) and the endoribonuclease activity of nsp15 (Ivanov et al., 2004b; Bhardwaj et al., 2004; Ricagno et al., 2006) .",

Distinct from the viral structural proteins, the functions served by the nsps are focused on the modulation of host environment to support viral replication and viral RNA synthesis. Integral membrane proteins nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6 engage in homotypic and heterotypic interactions to drive membrane rearrangements to form the network of double membrane vesicles (DMVs) and convoluted membranes (CMs) (Angelini et al., 2013) , or double membrane spherules from zippered ER membranes (Maier et al., 2013) , the sites of viral replication and also serve as the docking site for viral replication complexes (Oostra et al., 2008) . A recent study has identified critical residues on nsp7 and nsp8 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which are essential for efficient de novo RNA synthesis by nsp12, indicating that interactions among these proteins contribute to the processivity of RNA synthesis (Subissi et al., 2014) .",

Viral protein-RNA interactions are assumed to occur between the key replication enzymes, nsp7, nsp8 and nsp12, thus forming a complex exhibiting replicase activity in the presence of a RNA primer (Subissi et al., 2014) . In addition, although some nsps have not been assigned with functions involved in coronavirus RNA synthesis, they might still be participating in viral RNA replication or transcription. In this study, a two-pronged approach was adopted to study viral proteins and protein-RNA interactions in coronavirus RNA synthesis. To elucidate RNA-protein interactions, an attempt was made to detect the presence of RNA-binding activity in any of the IBV nsps, which had not been previously reported to possess such an activity. This was done using available constructs over-expressing individual nsps in a biotin pull-down assay with biotinylated probes. The second method used was to conduct a screen for protein-protein interactions between viral polymerase, nsp12 and other nsps.",

The bound proteins were eluted with 55 \u00b5l of 2X SDS loading dye and resolved by 8% and 15% SDS-PAGE gel. Because similar numbers of cells were used for infection and virus replication was comparable, the protein levels of host housekeeping genes were similar in cells infected with wild-type rIBV and rIBV-HA-RdRP, as determined by Western blot analysis of GAPDH and \u03b2-actin (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1c , HA-tagged nsp12 could be specifically detected in the cell lysate and co-precipitated samples in cells infected with rIBV-HA-RdRP but not in cells infected with wildtype rIBV. Detection of co-precipitated proteins was performed by Western blot using available antisera for IBV nsps as well as structural proteins S and N. We noted that some antisera (especially \u03b1-nsp15) picked up one or more non-specific bands. Only if the target protein of correct molecular weight was detected at similar levels in the whole cell lysates, but could only be detected in the co-immunoprecipitated sample from rIBV-HA-RdRP-infected cells, it would be considered to be a potential interacting partner of HA-tagged nsp12.",

For the structural proteins, S protein was not detected in the immunoprecipitated samples, while a similar level of N was detected in cells infected with wild type IBV and rIBV-HA-RdRP (HA) (Fig. 2 , panels anti-IBV S and N). Although it appeared that the amount co-precipitated in rIBV-HA-RdRP-infected samples was slightly higher compared to wild type IBV infected samples, the amount detected in the cell lysates was also slightly higher. So it was unlikely for N to have been specifically co-precipitated by an interaction with nsp12. Nsp3, nsp5, nsp8 and nsp14, but not nsp10, nsp13 and nsp15/nsp16, were specifically detected in the precipitated samples of rIBV-HA-RdRP-infected cells (Fig. 2) . As previously reported, a dominant band with an apparent molecular weight of 58 kDa could be detected by Western blot in cells infected with wild type IBV with anti-nsp14 antiserum (Fang et al., 2007) . This was proved to be a nonspecific band from our previous work (Xu et al., 2010) . As nsp14 band is usually very weak and migrates on SDS-PAGE gel just below this non-specific band, much more samples were added during precipitation and gel loading, leading to the detection of a specific band representing nsp14 in HA-beads precipitated samples (Fig. 2) . However, this band cannot be separated from the nonspecific band in total cell lysates (Fig. 2) . Anti-nsp13 antibodies failed to detect a specific band representing nsp13 either in total cell lysates or in HA-beads precipitated samples (Fig. 2) . This issue will be further studied by using a recombinant virus with HA-tagged nsp13 (Zhai et al., 2005) .",

The proteins were co-expressed as a FLAG-tagged protein for nsp8 (FLAG-nsp8) and a Myc-tagged protein for nsp12 (Myc-nsp12) in H1299 cells. As controls, dual vector transfected samples (FLAG + Myc) and single vector transfected samples (FLAG-nsp8 + Myc and FLAG + Myc-nsp12) were included. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-Myc coated beads (Mycbeads) and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blot was then performed using anti-FLAG-HRP and anti-Myc-HRP antibodies to detect the precipitated proteins. As shown in Fig. 4 , FLAG-nsp8 was detected at almost equal amounts whether it was expressed together with Myc only (FLAG-nsp8 + Myc) or with Myc-nsp12 (FLAG-nsp8 + Myc-nsp12), but was detected in the Myc pulled-down samples only when it was co-expressed with Myc-nsp12 (Fig. 4, left panel) . Th\u1ebd 50 kDa band detected in all immunoprecipitated samples was likely to be the heavy chain eluted from the beads during sample preparation for SDS-PAGE. Also, Myc-nsp12 was detected in both the cell lysates and immunoprecipitated samples (Fig. 4, right panel) . As FLAG-nsp8 in the immunoprecipitated sample was detected only when Myc-nsp12 was co-expressed, it was concluded that FLAG-nsp8 was coprecipitated with Myc-nsp12 by interacting with it. These results confirm that nsp12 could interact with nsp8 in the absence of other viral proteins and viral genomic/subgenomic RNAs.",

Similar result was also obtained in the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 5B) . A low level of Myc-nsp12 was detected in the whole cell lysate, due to the loading of the small amount of cell lysate as input, as compared with the large amount of cell lysate used for co-immunoprecipitation. The two reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments thus confirmed that nsp8 interacts directly with nsp12 and further supported that this interaction is not dependent on the presence of the genomic and subgenomic viral RNA.",

Virology 513 (2018) [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] we hypothesized that critical domains and/or protein folding motifs would remain intact, and thus the structural features and stability of the mutants would not be drastically affected. The three mutants encode IBV nsp12 fragments with considerable overlaps, to ensure that potential nsp8 interacting domain(s) disrupted by the margin of a fragment would still remain intact in another mutant. The three mutants and full-length nsp12 (Myc-nsp12) were either co-expressed with FLAG-nsp8. The cell lysates were probed to assess the expression levels of the different nsp12 mutants. As shown in Fig. 6b (left), full-length Myc-nsp12 was detected at high levels in transfected cells. Protein levels of Myc-nsp12n and Myc-nsp12c were slightly lower, while that of Myc-nsp12m was considerably lower compared with the full-length protein, suggesting that the deletion mutants were not as stable as the full-length protein. The cell lysates were also precipitated with FLAG-beads and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detection was made with anti-Myc-HRP antibody. As expected, the full-length Myc-nsp12 interacted strongly with FLAG-nsp8 and was efficiently co-precipitated. On the other hand, the level of co-precipitated protein was lower for Myc-nsp12n and considerably lower for Myc-nsp12c, compared with that of full-length nsp12. No detectable level of Myc-nsp12m could be co-precipitated (Fig. 6b, right) . Therefore, the nsp8 interacting domain(s) in nsp12 was attributed mainly by the Nterminal region, and to a lesser degree by the C-terminal region, but not its middle region. The absence of Myc-tagged protein co-precipitation in samples which were co-expressed with FLAG-epitope, indicated that the co-precipitation of Myc-nsp12n and Myc-nsp12c were dependent on the presence and their interaction with FLAG-nsp8, as was the case for Myc-nsp12.",

Further characterization of the nsp8-nsp12 complex demonstrated that the formation of this complex is independent of the 5\u2032and 3\u2032-UTRs of viral RNA and other nsps. Nsp8 interacts with nsp12 at two points, both the N-and C-terminial regions of the protein. Analysis of viral RNA-protein interactions using the biotin pull-down assay revealed that nsp2, nsp8, nsp9 and nsp10 exhibit RNA-binding activity to either of the UTRs. The efforts to draw a more complete picture were hampered by the difficulty of expressing/detecting certain nsps, such as nsp4 and nsp13, as well as the insolubility of nsp6, a protein containing multiple transmembrane domains (Oostra et al., 2008) .",

The screen also showed that nsp9 and nsp10 only bind to some but not all three probes tested. This is unexpected as both proteins were previously documented to have RNA-binding activities with a non-specific nature Egloff et al., 2004; Joseph et al., 2006) . This could, however, be explained by the generally weak interactions of these two proteins and the RNA probes that could escape detection in one or more of the screens. The interaction between nsp8 and IBV 3\u2032-UTR (+) may have provided another piece of evidence that nsp8 is heavily involved in viral RNA synthesis, as a RNA-primer synthesizing enzyme for nsp12. It should also be noted that the observed differential interactions of these nsps with UTRs in cells overexpressing these proteins may be due to the fact that the amounts of the over-expressed nsps may be likely rather different from those expressed in virus-infected cells.",

The p12 and p64 fragments were shown to form a stable complex and the p12 fragment may play a role in primer-binding while the p64 fragment contains the polymerase activity.

In this model, the nsp7-nsp8 complex would first synthesize a RNA-primer of a sufficient length, which would be exposed to and binds to the N-terminal region of nsp12, brought in close proximity through its interaction with nsp8. The extension of the RNA chain could then be catalyzed by the polymerase domain in the C-terminal region of nsp12, which would also be oriented in close proximity to the end of the RNA-primer through its interactions at its N-terminal region with nsp8. This arrangement of the two RdRPs would ensure the high efficiency of the replicase complex as the RNA primers synthesized by nsp8 could be utilized by nsp12 immediately for transcription elongation. This putative model is supported by structural studies showing that nsp8 is a very elongated molecule (Xiao et al., 2012) , it could be easily spanning the N-and the C-terminal regions of nsp12. Further characterization of the interaction between nsp8 and nsp12 is required to ascertain if the proposed model is valid. In addition, identification and characterization of the interactions between nsp12 and other nsps as well as the interactions among other nsps would be required to depict a more complete picture of the viral replication/transcription complex. Attempts to coexpress all nsps in the same cells were made, but no presentable data were generated, possibly due to the low expression efficiency of several nsps and the even lower expression efficiency when co-expressing them.",

Kinetic analysis of HA-RdRP expression in cells infected with rIBV-HA-RdRP. Confluent H1299 cells were infected with approximately 2 MOI of wild type IBV (wt) and rIBV-HA-RdRP (HA), respectively. Cells infected with rIBV-HA-RdRP were harvested at 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 h post-infection, respectively. As a control, cells infected with wild type IBV were harvested at 16 h post-infection. Total cell lysates were prepared, and proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with anti-HA antibodies. Numbers on the left indicate protein sizes in kilodalton. b. Replication of rIBV-HA-RdRPin H1299 cells. Confluent H1299 cells were infected with approximately 2 MOI of wild type IBV (wt) and rIBV-HA-RdRP (HA), respectively. The infected cells were harvested at 8 and 24 h post-infection, respectively. Total cell lysates were prepared, proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with anti-N antisera. Numbers on the left indicate protein sizes in kilodalton. c. Immunoprecipitation of HA-nsp12 in rIBV-HA-RdRP-infected H1299 cells with HA-beads. Confluent H1299 cells were infected with approximately 2 MOI of wild type IBV (wt) and rIBV-HA-RdRP (HA), respectively. The infected cells were harvested at 16 h post-infection and total cell lysates were prepared. Proteins in the total cell lysates were either separated on 15% SDS-PAGE directly or subjected to immunopecipitation with anti-HA beads before being loaded onto the gel. Analysis of HA-nsp12 expression and immunoprecipitation efficiency was done by Western blot with anti-nsp12 antisera. Numbers on the left indicate protein sizes in kilodalton.",
