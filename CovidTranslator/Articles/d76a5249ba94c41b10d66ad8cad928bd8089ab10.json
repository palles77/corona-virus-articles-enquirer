In this study, we cloned, expressed and purified N protein of SARS-CoV. This 46-kD N protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and Western-blot. Then, the peptides binding-specific to N protein were identified using 15-mer phage-displayed library. Surprisingly, all of the 89 clones from monoclonal ELISA were positive (S/N>2.1) and the result was further confirmed experimentally once again. Six N protein-binding peptides, designated separately as SNA1, SNA2, SNA4, SNA5, SNA9 and SNG11, were selected for sequencing. Sequence analysis suggested that SNA5 shared approximatively 100% sequence identity to SNA4, SNA2, SNA9 and SNA1. In addition, the binding specificity of the 15-mer peptides with the SARS-CoV N protein was further demonstrated by blocking ELISA using the synthetical 15-mer peptide according to the deduced amino acid sequence of SNA5. Also, the deduced amino sequence of SNA5 was compared with proteins in translated database using the tblastx program, and the results showed that the proteins with the highest homology were Ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase iron-sulfur subunits (UCRI or UQCR), otherwise known as the Rieske iron-sulfur proteins (RISP). Notablely, in the [2Fe-2S] redox centre of UCRI, there were 6 residues [GGW(Y)F(Y)CP] compatible to the residues (position 2\u21927, GGWFCP7) of the NH2-terminal of the 15-mer peptide, which indicated higher binding specificity between the N protein of SARS-CoV and the redox centre of UCRI to some extent. Here, the possible molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV N protein in the pathogenesis of SARS are discussed.",

            "text": "Recently, researches on N protein of SARS-CoV have mainly focused on the use of recombinant SARS-CoV N protein ELISA-based antibody tests for the serodiagnosis of SARS-CoV pneumonia and for the study of the seroprevalence of nonpneumonic SARS-CoV infection [25 -32] . However, Surjit et al. [33] reported that SARS-CoV N protein was capable of inducing apoptosis of COS-1 monkey kidney cells in the absence of growth factors by down-regulating ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), up-regulating JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) and p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathways, and affect their downstream effectors. Moreover, Mizutani et al. [34, 35] confirmed that SARS-CoV infection could induce activation of the p38 MAPK signaling pathway and the p38 MAPK inhibitor (Akt) partially could inhibit its cytopathic effect in Vero E6 cells. In fact, the apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV infection was described in other literatures as well [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . In addition, previous studies with other coronaviruses, such as Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) [41] , human coronavirus (HCoV) strain 229E [19] , Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [42, 43] and Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) [44] , indicated that these viruses have evolved strategies to either inhibit or stimulate host cell apoptosis, depending on the particular virus-host interaction. And El\u00e9ou\u00ebt et al. [41] further demonstrated that the TGEV N protein underwent proteolysis in parallel ARTICLES VIROLOGY with the activation of caspases within the host cell (the human rectal tumor cell line HRT18). Our findings revealed that the proteins with the highest homology to SNA5 binding-specific to SARS-CoV N protein were UCRIs, and in the [2Fe-2S] redox centre of UCRI, there were six residues [GGW(Y)F(Y)CP] compatible to the residues (position 2\u21927, GGWFCP7) of the NH 2 -terminal of the 15-mer peptide. All these suggest that N protein of SARS-CoV functions as an induction factor for apoptosis induced by SARS-CoV infection although such a suggestion has not been further confirmed by any research group.",
