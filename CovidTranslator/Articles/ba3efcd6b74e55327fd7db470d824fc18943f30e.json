Detailed information on air traffic between international airports has been demonstrated to be useful in retrospectively validating and prospectively predicting case emergence in other countries. In this paper, we use a well-established metric known as effective distance on the global air traffic data from IATA to quantify risk of emergence for different countries as a consequence of direct importation from China, and compare it against arrival times for the first 24 countries. Using this model trained on official first reports from WHO, we estimate time of arrival (ToA) for all other countries. We then incorporate data on airline suspensions to recompute the effective distance and assess the effect of such cancellations in delaying the estimated arrival time for all other countries. Finally we use the infectious disease vulnerability indices to explain some of the estimated reporting delays.",

To ensure that the effective distances on the air traffic network are comparable with and without interventions, we scale the flow volume in the latter with total outflow from origin in the former. Assuming that the total outflow from a country without airline suspensions is reflective of the country population size, normalizing the reduced flows with it could provide better estimates for P mn .

A scatter plot of COVID-19 ToA for countries with reported cases with respect to their effective distance from China is shown in Figure 1a . It should be noted that in the regression analysis, China has effective distance and time of arrival set to zero. The difference between reported ToA and linear estimator is provided in Figure 1b . The median error in estimation is less than a day with the estimated ToA typically being earlier than the reported ToA. Note that there are a few outliers which have much earlier reported ToA than estimated ToA (e.g., Nepal, Japan, Thailand). For these countries, airline traffic may not be representative of the total connectivity with China due to their spatial proximity (land or sea). In order to assess the risk of direct importation of COVID-19 from China to various countries we computed the estimated ToA for each country, using their effective distance from China (shown in Figure 2 ). The effective distance tree plot 3 clearly show that the early reporting countries indeed had the shortest effective distance to China (at the center). The predicted time of arrival using the linear estimator is shown in the map, excluding countries which do not have direct airline traffic from China. Finally, we plot the estimated times of arrival of all countries against their vulnerability (IDVI), grouped by the United States Combatant Commands, providing a natural geographic grouping. As demonstrated in Figure 2b , the countries with reported cases (shown with plus marker) are mostly to the left. Interestingly, most countries with reported cases also have higher IDVI, which may be due to a combination of (a) high connectivity and air traffic to China, (b) better detection and reporting capabilities for imported cases. In general, the lower left region (low IDVI and low estimated ToA) indicates a regime of high risk, which is relatively empty for this outbreak. However, we notice that several low IDVI countries (especially those in AFRICOM) are estimated to have times of arrival in the first three weeks of February. Equally concerning are countries to the left with circle markers, which have an early estimated time of arrival but haven't officially reported cases yet. ",

The results of univariate regressions of each of the IDVI scores is shown in Table 1 . We generally observe the negative relationship between the reporting delays (lower IDVI leads to higher reporting delays). Of the different normed scores, we see that the political scores (domestic and international) have the highest coefficients of determination (24% and 18% respectively, p < 0.05). The domestic score includes as components indicators of governance, corruption, decentralization, government stability, etc. while the international score captures aspects such as collaboration, international organization support and aid dependence. These are aspects which could have direct or indirect bearing on the detection and reporting of infectious disease outbreaks. The overall IDVI score explains about 16% of the variance (p < 0.05). While this is a reasonable first step, and does explain some of the apparent late reporting we are observing, we note that the estimated reporting delay may need to be replaced by other metrics of reporting Figure 4 .

Some of the limitations of the current work can be overcome with more timely data availability and improved model assumptions. Firstly, the current observations are based on first official reports which in some cases can be quite different from first importations. Also, due to the evolving nature of the outbreak and limited observations, the linear estimator coefficients could change with new reports and altered travel conditions. While air traffic data from IATA allows us to quantify population exposure, (a) it is dated and may not be reflective of current conditions; (b) may not be representative of all human mobility between the countries. As we observed, some countries that are geographically closer to China (e.g., Nepal, Thailand and Japan) have very early arrival times (in relation to estimates based on effective distance). This highlights the need to account for multi-modal transport networks for quantifying the risk of global importations. However, this also raises concerns about other countries and regions (such as Pakistan, Myanmar and Northeastern India) which are geographically adjacent to China but haven't reported any cases yet. Notably, many of these regions scored relatively poorly on the indices of societal function, suggesting ties between the openness of a given regional government and the timeliness and accuracy of their data.",

The current analysis can be extended by considering weighting the effective distance from multiple origins with their relative levels of infection. Further, while we have tried to incorporate data on airline suspensions, this may not be complete, and will not capture the actual reductions in flow volumes due to travel advisories, government restrictions and behavioral adaptations. There are also a number of screening procedures in place at international airports, which could potentially delay case importations.",

Here m, a , b , c , and n represent the nodes and the effective distance is computed between node m and n. Figure 5a represents the network construction using IATA data for computing the effective distance between node m and n. In this construction, f mn represents the number of passengers (passenger flow) on the path [(m, n)]. IATA data consists of all the paths (along with the flow) that were used by passengers in the travel between source m and destination n. In the example network (Figure 5a ), the paths arewith respective flows as f mn , f m a n , f m b c n . The total flow between nodes m and n is the sum of the flows through all the paths connecting them and we denote it as F mn = f m an + f mn + f m b c n . With k F mk as the total outflow from node m, we defineF mn = F mn / k F mk , as the probability of a traveller exiting node m has destination node n. The effective distance between nodes m and n is defined as Figure 5 . A toy example that compares networks derived from IATA and OAG data. Nodes n and m are considered as source and destination, respectively. (a) Network constructed using IATA data.Fmn = fmn/ k F mk ,F m an = f m a n / k F mk , andF m b c n = f m b c n / k F mk , the bold arrow is used to representsFmn =f m a n +fmn +f m b c n , the total fraction of flow from origin m to destination n. (b) Network constructed using the OAG data. The dashed lines are used to represent nodes and outflows that do not contribute to the computation of the edge weights in the graph.As for network construction using OAG data (cf. Figure 5b ) we denote S mn as the total number of seats between airports m and n.S mn = S mn / k S mk denotes the probability of a person exiting node m (as either origin or transit) has the next stop at node n and the effective distance is defined as d mn = 1 \u2212 logS mn . In [3] , the authors consider all the paths that can be constructed between the two nodes which in this case is the set \u0393 and define the effective distance as the shortest path between the two nodes: D OAG mn = min \u03b3\u2208\u0393 \u03bb(\u03b3), where \u03bb(\u03b3) = (i,j)\u2208\u03b3 d ij is the length of path \u03b3.",
