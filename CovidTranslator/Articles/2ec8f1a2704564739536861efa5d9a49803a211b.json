It is associated with lower and most likely also upper respiratory tract infections. Most commonly reported symptoms are cough, rhinorrhea, expiratory wheezing and fever, and the virus is preferentially detected in young children. We report three children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who had acute febrile episodes with concomitant detection of human bocavirus in their respiratory secretions. One of them had five consecutive febrile episodes during 6 months, all associated with the presence of human bocavirus at varying viral loads, suggesting prolonged shedding or reactivation of the virus.",

The swab was then inserted into a vial containing viral transport medium (5% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.5% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics in phosphate-buffered saline) [9] . One aliquot of the sample was restored at \u221270\u00b0C. Virus culture was done by using the Ohio strain of HeLa cells and human foreskin fibroblasts according to routine procedure. Viral antigens for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1, 2 and 3, and influenza A and B viruses were detected using a time-resolved fluoroimmunoassay with monoclonal antibodies [1] . The details of the PCR assays used for rhinovirus, enteroviruses, human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6), coronavirus types OC43 and 229E 52 and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) have been reported earlier [1, 11] .

A cloned HBoV plasmid was used as a quantitative standard. PCR reactions were carried out in a 25 \u03bcl volume consisting of QuantiTect Probe PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), 600 nM of each primer, and 100 nM of probe, and 5 \u03bcl extracted DNA.

The plasmid standard could be detected at the level of a single copy per reaction.

HBoV may also be associated with diarrhea [3, 14, 15] . The occurrence of HBoV has been reported to be higher in children than in the adult population, varying from 5.6% to 19% in young children with respiratory disease [3, 13] . The association between HBoV and respiratory disease has been questioned because coinfections with other respiratory viruses occur in 33-83% of the HboV-positive cases and in most cases [1, 6] . Recently, we found HBoV in 19% of 259 children hospitalized due to acute expiratory wheezing. In 12 cases (5%) HBoV was the only virus detected and in 10 of these cases a high viral load suggested primary infection. HBoV DNA was identified also in the serum of these patients suggesting a systemic infection [1] . It is important that in four studies with totally 491 asymptomatic controls only 3 positive cases have been detected supporting the causative role of HBoV in symptomatic subjects [1, 6, 14, 17] . On the other hand, lifelong persistence and reactivation of other parvoviruses have been reported with and without symptomatic disease during immunosuppression [7, 20, 23] .",

These tests found other concomitant respiratory viruses in 30 of 49 cases positive for human bocavirus in our previous study [10] . The occurrence of HBoV in febrile children with leukemia in our study was 5%. Our patients had symptoms of febrile respiratory disease and febrile gastroenteritis. They all recovered from infection within days without any need for intensive care. The causative role of HBoV, however, for febrile infection in our immunosuppressed patients is not clear. Most episodes were associated with HboV at low copy numbers, which we have suggested to present asymptomatic shedding in immunocompetent children. Our third case is, to our knowledge, the first reported patient with repetitive detection of HBoV showing prolonged shedding or reactivation over a 5-month period, thus supporting the hypothesis that HBoV may persist for a long time after primary infection [1] . It is not certain that the same HBoV strain was detected all the time, because no sequence studies were carried out. The genetic variability of HBoV is on the other hand very low [5, 22] . One may speculate that the high viral load detected in two febrile episodes indicates that HBoV could be a causative agent of [12] . Previously, one adult cancer patient with severe atypical pneumonia associated with HBoV detection has been reported [19] . This patient had symptoms of fever and cough, and a computer tomography scan of the lungs showed bilateral reticulonodular infiltrations. HBoV was detected from BAL samples, while all bacterial and fungal tests as well as tests for other respiratory viruses remained negative. Her symptoms subsided within days, and no mechanical ventilation was needed. Recently, HBoV detection in other adult and pediatric immunocompromised patients with previous organ transplants or patients with HIV infection have been reported from large respiratory disease surveys [3, 19, 26] .",

In some cases, a virus infection may explain a poor response to antibiotic treatment, and specific antiviral therapy may be available. On the other hand, respiratory virus infections may also pave the way to invasive bacterial infections, leading to even more severe morbidity. Searching for respiratory viruses should be a part of clinical practice in febrile children with cancer. Whether detection of respiratory viruses in these patients reflects primary infection, reinfection, persistence or reactivation deserves further studies.",
