Electron microscopic studies of the early lesions of white matter disclosed two different kinds of cell degeneration which developed prior to the myelin disruption and mononuclear cell infiltration. One was a small pyknotic cell, which is thought to be an oligodendrocyte and the other is a ballooned cell containing abundant microtubules. Virus particles could be demonstrated only in the latter cell type. Discussion about astrocytes as well as oligodendrocytes was made in relation to the initial stage ofdemyelination caused by virus infection. This animal model may be useful in the analysis of the mechanisms leading to demyelination in subacute or chronic infections.",

The infected animals develop an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis with areas of demyelination in brain and spinal cord. In addition, the neuropathological changes consist of fresh necrosis, neuronal death, glial nodules and polymorphonuclear infiltrations (Bailey et al., 1949; Waksman and Adams, 1962; Lampert, 1973) . Electronmicroscopic and virological studies suggest that demyelination in this virus-host system is the result of the destruction of oligodendrocytes by the virus infection. However, the neuropathological picture of this CNS disorder differs in many aspects from those of other demyelinating diseases with a more subacute type of infection. Therefore, JHM infection in mice cannot be used as a model for the analysis of demyelination in subacute or chronic inflammatory CNS diseases.",

Lampert and coworkers (1973) described almost similar degenerating cells in their experiments of mice infected with JHM virus and interpreted them as possible oligodendrocytes. In SDE, this cell also seems to be an oligodendrocyte because of its presence in white matter prior to mononuclear cell infiltration, its cell size and clumping pattern of nucleochromatin, and its lacking of glial fibrils. The destruction of oligodendrocytes in EAE is thought to be caused by immune mediated reactions, while that in SDE may be the result of the viral infection since at least some of the oligodendrocyte contain viral antigen. It is noteworthy, however, that no obvious virus particles could be demonstrated in these cells despite their great number of appearance.",

On the other hand, based on morphological findings, these cells could also be astrocytes because their cell sizes are large and their nucleochromation are pale. According to the research of gliogenesis, immature astrocytes contain microtubules which gradually disappear as they become mature (Vaughn, 1969; Skoff et al., 1976) . This finding could suggest that the presence of microtubules do not have the strong diagnostic value for glial cells.

In other demyelinating diseases such as canine distemper infection in dogs, virus structures are found only in astrocyte's (Wisniewski et al., 1972; Koestner et al., 1974; Raine, 1976) . Normal function of astrocytes'in white matter is obscure but it is believed that they partly participate in nutritional transport to oligodendrocytes. Changes in astrocyte function as a result of viral infection could cause destruction of oligodendrocytes leading to demyelination. This interpretation is indirectly supported by studies of Skoff (1976) who suggested that the myelin deficit in the Jimpy mouse may be due to cellular abnormalities in astroglia. Thus, to interpret the initial lesions of this subacute demyelination, cellular interactions between astrocytes and oligodendrocytes must be taken into consideration.",
