            "text": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes at least 25 membrane glycoproteins that are found in the viral envelope 1 . While gB represents the fusion protein, two glycoprotein complexes control the tropism of the virus: the gHgLgO trimer is involved in the infection of fibroblasts, while the gHgLpUL128L pentamer is required for infection of endothelial, epithelial and myeloid cells 2-5 . Two reports suggested that gB binds to ErbB1 and PDGFR\u03b1 6,7 , however these results do not explain the tropism of the virus and were recently challenged 8,9 . Here we provide a 19\u00c5 reconstruction for the gHgLgO trimer and show that it binds with high affinity through the gO subunit to PDGFR\u03b1, which is expressed on fibroblasts but not on epithelial cells. We also provide evidences that the trimer is essential for viral entry in all cell types. Furthermore, we identified the pentamer as a trigger for the ErbB pathway, which is essential for infection of epithelial cells.",

VR1814 is a clinical HCMV isolate that can infect both fibroblasts and epithelial cells and expresses both the gHgLgO trimer and the gHgLpUL128L pentamer [2] [3] [4] [5] . In contrast, AD169 is a laboratory adapted virus that infects fibroblasts, but not epithelial cells 3, 12, 13 and expresses the trimer, but not the pentamer due to a point mutation in UL131 ORF 2, 4 . Antibodies that bind to the shared gH glycoprotein neutralize infection of both fibroblasts and epithelial cells 14 , while antibodies to the pUL128 gene products are extremely potent in neutralizing infection of epithelial, endothelial and myeloid cells, but fail to neutralize infection of fibroblast 14, 15 . While it is well established that trimer and pentamer determine the tropism of the virus 16 , the cellular receptors involved remain a matter of debate 1 .",

Consistent with a previous report 7 , the pentamer-deficient AD169 virus led to the phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b1 and PDGFR\u03b2 in fibroblasts, while it failed to activate RTK in epithelial cells (Fig. 1a) , a finding that is consistent with the inability of AD169 to infect this cell type 4, 12 . Interestingly, the clinical isolate VR1814 led to the phosphorylation of PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2 and ErbB1 in fibroblasts, while in epithelial cells induced phosphorylation of ErbB1, ErbB2 and, to a lower extent, of PDGFR\u03b2 (Fig. 1a) . These findings are consistent with the expression of ErbB1 on both cell types and PDGFR\u03b1 on fibroblasts only ( Supplementary Fig. 2a,b and Supplementary Fig. 3) . Thus, the PDGFR\u03b1 pathway is triggered only in fibroblasts by both pentamer-deficient and pentamer-sufficient viruses, while the ErbB pathway is triggered only by the pentamer-sufficient VR1814 virus in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. These data are inconsistent with a previous report that suggested that gB, which is expressed by both viruses, is a ligand for ErbB 6 , but rather suggest that the pentamer might be the trigger of the ErbB pathway.",

In contrast, no specific band was obtained using pentamer on cell surface biotinylated fibroblasts, while multiple bands were obtained using pentamer on epithelial cells (Fig. 1b and Supplementary  Table 2 ). Recombinant trimer and pentamer were also used for pull-down experiments followed by western blot analysis. Pull-downs confirmed a specific interaction between trimer and PDGFR\u03b1 from fibroblasts, but not from epithelial cells (Fig. 1c) . These findings indicate that the HCMV trimer can bind to PDGFR\u03b1, which is selectively expressed on fibroblasts but not on epithelial cells, thus explaining the limited tropism of the pentamer-deficient AD169 virus 17 . In contrast, immunoprecipitation experiments failed to demonstrate a direct high affinity interaction between the pentamer and ErbB receptors, leaving the possibility that this interaction may have low affinity or requires additional molecules.",

In contrast, downregulation of PDGFR\u03b1 inhibited by 80% the infection of fibroblasts by AD169, but did not affect their infection by VR1814. To further validate these data we used a gene knockout approach in the haploid cell line HAP-1, which expresses PDGFR\u03b1 and ErbB2, as well as low levels of ErbB3 ( Supplementary Fig. 2c ). CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout of ErbB2 and ErbB3, but not PDGFR\u03b1, strongly reduced infection of HAP-1 cells by VR1814 virus (Fig. 1e) . Reciprocally, knockout of PDGFR\u03b1, but not ErbB2 or ErbB3, completely inhibited infection by AD169. Of note, knockout of integrin \u03b21, which was shown to play a role as co-receptor in HCMV entry 18, 19 , did not affect infection by AD169 or VR1814 viruses (Fig. 1e) , a finding which suggests that multiple integrins may play a role as co-receptors in HCMV entry 18, 19 .",

Remarkably, a monoclonal anti-gO was also able to reduce ARPE-19 infection (Fig. 2e) . This surprising result suggests that the trimer might have a dual function of viral ligand and activator of gB fusogenic activity, as recently proposed 22, 23 . Since we did not find evidence for binding of pentamer to ErbB receptors, we tested the inhibitory capacity of ErbB ligands, which down-regulate the cognate receptors ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ). Interestingly, infection of epithelial cells was inhibited by preincubation of the cells with HB-EGF (which binds to ErbB1 and ErbB4), EGF (which binds to ErbB1) or Nrg-1 (which binds to ErbB4 on ARPE-19 cells) (Fig. 2f) . These results support the notion that entry into epithelial cells relies on ErbB receptors.",

Addition of PDGFR\u03b1 to soluble trimer shifted the chromatography peak to a lower retention time, indicating formation of a complex (Fig.  4a,b) . Addition of a Fab fragment of the anti-gH antibody 13H11 to the purified complex further decrease the complex's retention time (Fig. 4c) . SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that the purified trimer-PDGFR\u03b1 and 13H11-trimer-PDGFR\u03b1 complexes contained all indicated components (Fig. 4d ). The images of the complexes formed were visualized by negative staining and transmission electron microscopy with 2D averaging (Fig. 4e -h and Supplementary Fig. 8 ). The gHgLgO trimer alone presented a boot shaped structure, wherein gHgL formed the elongated structure and gO the angled extension (Fig. 4e, h) , similar to what was recently reported 26 . Interestingly, and in agreement with the BLI results, the image of gHgLgO trimer-PDGFR\u03b1 complex revealed that only the gO subunit interacts with PDGFR\u03b1, it appeared that three Ig-like domains of the PDGFR\u03b1 were visible in the 2D-averaged density, resembling the mode of interaction between platelet-derived growth factor and its receptor ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ). However, not all domains of PDGFR\u03b1 were well-defined due to its flexibility 27 (Fig. 4f ). This result was further confirmed by the observation that 13H11 Fab bound to a site of gH away from the gO interacting face and, therefore, did not interfere with binding of gO to PDGFR\u03b1 ( Fig. 3c and Fig. 4g ). Consequently, we conclude that the neutralizing activity of 13H11 is not due to the inhibition of trimer-PDGFR\u03b1 interaction but may be dependent on its ability to interfere with the capacity of the complex to trigger gB and consequently viral fusion 20 .",

The role of PDGFR\u03b1 as a HCMV receptor was recently challenged by Vanarsdall and colleagues 9 showing that PDGF-AA and anti-PDGFR\u03b1 antibodies did not block infection of fibroblasts by a HCMV clinical isolate. These results are in agreement with our finding. Pentamer-sufficient virus might alter the nature of the entry pathway by inducing viral endocytosis.",

However, this model is inconsistent with the differential tropism of wild type and pentamer-deficient viruses, since both viruses express gB. In addition, the recent experiment showing that gB expressed on target cells can promote the fusion of gB-deficient trimer-expressing virus might suggest that gB lacks a cellular receptor 26 . It is therefore tempting to suggest that the interaction of gB with PDGFR\u03b1 and ErbB1 might be mediated by pentamer and trimer, which might have the dual function of cellular receptor binding and of triggering the fusogenic activity of gB as proposed recently for the trimer 22, 23 and similarly to what described for gD in HSV-1 27 .",

Cell supernatant was batch-incubated with 5 ml complete His-Tag Purification Resin (Roche) at room temperature for 30 minutes with continuous inversion mixing. 6 mM imidazole was added to reduce nonspecific binding. The resin was packed into a column and sequentially washed with 3 column volume of buffers containing 6 mM and 15 mM imidazole in 400 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris/Cl \u2212 pH7.5. The protein was eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. Expression and purification of the soluble pentamer was previously described by our group 15 . Soluble trimer complex was generated using a single polycistronic vector encoding three genes (gH, gL, and gO). The gH subunit lacking the transmembrane domain and modified at the C-terminus by addition of a TEV cleavage site, six histidine and a twin strep tags was separated from gL by a self-cleaving 2A peptide. The gHgL and gO subunits were cloned, respectively, in pEE6.4 and pEE12.4 vectors (Lonza Biologics). Stable cell line secreting the HCMV trimer, was generated by nucleofection of CHO-K1 SV line (GS-System, Lonza). For protein expression, CHO cells were seeded at 1\u00d710 6 /ml in ProCho5 (Lonza); after 10 days, supernatants were harvested and loaded on IMAC column eluted with imidazole and further purified by affinity column StrepTactin II (Qiagen). Histidine and twin strep tags were removed by treatment with the TEV protease. Protease and uncleaved proteins were removed by negative chromatography. Finally, proteins were further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 from GE Healthcare). Soluble dimer was generated by transient transfection of gH2AgL in pEE6.4 vectors (Lonza Biologics). Dimer protein purification was performed as described above.",
