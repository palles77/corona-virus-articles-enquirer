A reservoir (A) has been added to a classical SIR model where the pathogen is persistent. Individuals are characterized by their epidemiological status in the incidental host (S: suceptible; I: infected; R: recovered). A susceptible individual becomes infected through the transmission by contact at rate \u03b2SI or through the reservoir at rate \u03c4 S. An infected individual recovers at rate \u03b3. Stochastic simulations are performed with the following values: the transmission by contact, expressed as the basic reproductive ratio, 0 < R 0 < 10, the spillover transmission, 10 \u22121 < \u03c4 < 10 \u221210 and the recovery rate \u03b3 = 0.1.

R 0 corresponds to the average number of secondary infections 105 produced by an infected individual in an otherwise susceptible population. The interest of this ratio is mostly the notion of threshold: in a deterministic model, for a pathogen to invade the population, R 0 must be larger than 1 in the absence of reservoir. In a stochastic model, the higher the R 0 the higher the probability for the pathogen to invade the population. In a SIR model, the basic reproduc-110 tive ratio R 0 equals to \u03b2N \u03b3 . Individuals in the recovered compartment do not contribute anymore to the transmission process. Since we assume that demographic processes are slower than epidemic processes, the number of susceptible individuals decreases during the epidemic due to the consumption of susceptibles by the infection until the extinction of the population.",

Stuttering chains of transmission occur when the pathogen is barely contagious between individuals (small R 0 ) and when the recurrent emergence of the pathogen (\u03c4 ) is low.

In this case the approximating branching process will be supercritical and will go to infinity with a positive probability. In the case when the epidemic process describes small excursions, the branching process approximation is still valid, but in the case when it describes a large excursion, then a large fraction of susceptible individuals will be consumed and the branching approximation will not be valid anymore.

The idea is the following: first, as the excursions of a subcritical branching process are 410 small, we can make the approximation that, at the beginning, the infection rate 27 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/213579 doi: bioRxiv preprint by the reservoir is constant equal to \u03c4 N , and that the direct transmission rate is equal to \u03b2N I. Making this approximation allows us to treat the two processes of infection (by contact and by the reservoir) independently. Second, using a result of Singh and Myers (2014), we get the mean number of independent 415 infections by the reservoir during an outbreak under our approximation [19] . As the infections by the reservoir during an outbreak describe a Poisson process, we know that their times are uniformly distributed during the outbreak. As a consequence, we make the approximation that the successive local maxima of the number of infected individuals during the outbreak corresponds to the 420 successive maxima of the outbreaks generated by the independent infections by the reservoir. However, we have to take into account the fact that there is at least one infected individual remaining in the population when a new individual is infected by the reservoir (otherwise the new infected individual would generate a new outbreak). Hence we will make the approximation than the event 'the 425 excursion does not hit the treshold c' and the event 'no excursion generated by an infection by the reservoir and with initially two infected individuals, hits the treshold c' are equivalent. Notice that by doing that we underestimate the probability of an excursion to reach any threshold we may explain why we overestimate the spillover transmission \u03c4 maximizing the number of outbreaks. 28 .

Indeed, most theoretical works only consider pathogen transmission between conspecifics for predicting disease epidemiology. Here, we build a stochastic SIR model to consider the statistical process underlying a spillover transmission. We draw on the model to predict the number and the280 size of outbreaks as a function of both the spillover transmission and the direct transmission. The model shows that spillover transmission influences the epidemiological dynamics as much as the transmission by direct contact between individuals. Three different dynamics are observed, ranging from the absence of oubreaks to a single large outbreak; The findings have implications for (1) 285 modelling the dynamics of EIDs, (2) understanding the occurrence of outbreaks in the case of pathogens that are barely contagious and (3) control strategies. The limitations of our approach are discussed. In our results, the appearance of outbreaks depends on both the transmission from the reservoir and the direct transmission between individuals. Gen-290 erally, the occurrence of epidemics in humans is attributed to the ability of the pathogen to propagate between individuals. In the case of a single-host process, the notion of the basic reproductive ratio R 0 seems sufficient to evaluate the spread of the pathogen in a population entirely composed of susceptible indiEIDs, R 0 is also used to gauge the risk of pandemics. In this way, Lloyd-Smith et al. (2009) delineate the three stages identified for a zoonotic pathogen [13] by using the ability of the pathogen to spread between individuals. Each stage corresponds to a specific epidemiological dynamics ranging from a non-contagious pathogen making an outbreak impossible (Stage II, R 0 = 0) to a barely contagious pathogen with few outbreaks and stuttering chains of 300 transmission (Stage III, R 0 < 1) to a contagious pathogen making a large outbreak possible (Stage IV, R 0 > 1). The aim of the Wolfe's classification is to establish each stage in which a zoonotic pathogen may evolve to be adapted to human transmission only, in order to point out pathogens at potential risk of pandemics. However, by taking into account the recurrent emergence of 305 the pathogen from the reservoir, the three dynamics that define the three stages will depend on both the spillover transmission and the direct transmission of the pathogen between individuals. The results suggest that in the case of pathogen spilling recurrently over an incidental host, the direct transmission should not be the only parameter to consider. 310 The presence of a reservoir and its associated recurrent spillovers dramatically impact the epidemiological dynamics of infectious diseases in the incidental host. Without transmission from the reservoir, the probability to have an outbreak when the pathogen is barely contagious only depends on the direct transmission between individuals, and the outbreak rapidly goes extinct. By 315 contrast, the results show that the recurrent emergence of the pathogen from a reservoir increases the probability to observe an outbreak. Spillover transmission enhances the probability to both observe longer chains of transmission and reach the epidemiological threshold (i.e. threshold from which an outbreak is considered) even for a pathogen barely contagious. Moreover, this coupling model 320 (reservoir-human transmission) allows the appearance of multiple outbreaks depending on both the ability of the pathogen to propagate in the population and the transmission from the reservoir. Zoonotic pathogens such as MERS, Ebola or Nipah are poorly transmitted between individuals [21, 17, 22, 6] yet outbreaks of dozens/hundreds/thousands of infected individuals are observed.",

In365 these cases, the assumptions of a constant force of infection can be valid because the pathogen is endemic. However, the zoonotic pathogens can spill over multiple incidental hosts and they can infect each other. In the case of the ebola virus, which infects multiple incidental hosts such as apes, gorillas and monkeys [25], the principal mode of contamination of the human population is non-human pri-370 mate populations. Moreover, the contact patterns between animals and humans is one of the most important risk factors in the emergence of avian influenza outbreaks [26].

Each stage corresponds to a specific epidemiological dynamics in the incidental host. Stage II corresponds to few spillovers from animals (e.g. bats) to humans with no possible transmission between humans. Stage III corresponds to few stuttering chains of transmission between humans that go extinct (no outbreaks). Stage IV corresponds to large outbreaks in human population but the pathogen cannot be maintained without the reservoir.Only a few models have investigated the dynamics of EIDs by taking into account explicitly the transmission from the reservoir to the incidental host. Lloyd-Smith et al. (2009) have analysed 442 modelling studies of zoonotic pathogensand concluded that models incorporating spillover transmission are dismayingly rare[14]. More recent models aimed at investigating the dynamics of EIDs by taking into account the spread of the pathogen using multi-hosts processes but disregarding the persistence of the pathogen in the reservoir[15], or by focus-ing on the dynamics and conditions of persistence of the pathogen between two populations [16]. Others have considered an endemic reservoir but those models SIR) stochastic model coupled with a constant force of infection. Such model is mostly interested in the effect of population size and its impact on the size of an outbreak [19]. However, this approach does not allow teasing apart the contribution of incidental host transmission from that of the transmission from the reservoir in modulating the dynamics of zoonotic pathogens. case of transmission from the reservoir and more realistic. The model makes a number of assumptions. First, the epidemiological processes are much faster than the demographic processes. Second, the pathogen in the reservoir is considered as endemic and might contaminate recurrently the incidental host. Third, an individual cannot become susceptible after having been infected. As a consequence, the total number of susceptible individuals in the incidental host decreases during the epidemic. This is what is expected for an epidemic spreading locally during a short period of time (at the scale of a few thousands individuals during weeks or months, depending on the disease and populations considered). We then harness the model to predict the effects of both spillover transmission and direct transmission on the number and the size of outbreaks. Outbreaks occur when the number of cases of disease increases above what would normally be expected. We show that the recurrent emergence of the pathogen from the reservoir in the incidental host is as important as the transmission between individuals of the incidental host. We discuss the implications of these results for the classification of pathogens proposed by Lloyd-Smith et al. (2009).",
