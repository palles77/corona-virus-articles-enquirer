The outcomes 25 evaluated: feed intake, performance, body development, blood cells and metabolites, 26 insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), rumen fermentation, fecal scores and respiratory . CC-BY 4.0 : bioRxiv preprint 2 27 scores. All outcomes were evaluated during pre-weaning (4 -60 d of age), and 28 carryover effects on post-weaning (61 -90 d of age) periods. The experimental units 29 utilized were 29 newborn Holstein \u00d7 Gyr crossbred dairy heifers, with genetic 30 composition of 5/8 or more Holstein and 3/8 or less Gyr and body weight (BW) at birth 31 of 32.2 \u00b1 5.2 kg. Experimental units were randomly assigned to either a control group 32 (CON, n = 15) or a treatment group, consisting of supplementation of a blend of 33 essential oils (BEO, n = 14) with1 g/d/calf (Apex Calf, Adisseo, China). During the pre-34 weaning phase, all heifers were fed 5 L of MR/d reconstituted at 15% (dry matter basis), 35 divided into two equal meals. Water and starter were provided ad libitum. During the 36 post-weaning, animals received a maximum 3 kg of starter/d, and ad libitum corn silage, 37 divided into two meals. The outcomes feed intake, fecal and respiratory scores were 38 evaluated daily. BW was measured every three days, while body development was 39 recorded weekly. Blood samples were collected on 0, 30 and 60 d of age for total blood 40 cell count, weekly to determinate \u00df-hydroxybutyrate, urea and glucose, and biweekly 41 for IGF-1. Ruminal parameters (pH, volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N and 42 acetate:proprionate proportion -C2:C3) were measured each 14 days. A randomized 43 complete block design with an interaction between treatment and week was the 44 experimental method of choice to test the hypothesis of effect of BEO on all outcomes. 45 An ANOVA procedure was used for continuous outcomes and a non-parametric test 46 was used for the ordered categorical outcomes both adopting a C.I. = 95%. Results 47 indicated that there was not enough evidence to accept the alternative hypothesis of 48 effect of BEO in MR on: feed intake, performance, body development and blood 49 metabolites during both pre-weaning and post-weaning periods. However, results 50 indicated that the inclusion of BEO in MR significantly affects the proportion of C2:C3 51 during pre and post-weaning (P \u2264 0.05). Similarly, the effect is significant for basophil 52 (P \u2264 0.001) and platelet (P \u2264 0.05) counts in pre-weaning. The interaction between week . CC-BY 4.0 : bioRxiv preprint 3 53 and treatment was also significant for lymphocytes (P \u2264 0.001), revealing a long-term 54 treatment immunological effect. Lastly, the effect on fecal scores was also significant (P 55 \u2264 0.05) during pre-weaning, with lower values for BEO. BEO contributed for ruminal 56 manipulation on pre-weaning and carry over effect on post-weaning; immunity 57 improvement and a decrease morbidity of neonatal diarrhea in pre-weaning phase. 58 59 Introduction 60 A good calf-rearing program should embrace aspects that go from body 61 development, stress reduction, good feed and housing management to optimum health 62 status. Average daily gain (ADG) and body weight (BW) at weaning are important 63 metrics used to measure the success of the rearing program. It is well known that these 64 parameters are related to the heifer's future milk production, as well as to its immune 65 responses. Therefore, a bad life start can impact negatively on animal's adult 66 performance (1). Neonatal diseases, especially diarrhea, and nutritional mistakes can act 67 as stressors, lowering calf immunity, and increasing animal susceptibility to other 68 disorders (2).",

This activity could result in inhibition of ruminal deamination and 399 methanogenesis (13). As a consequence, it would result in a decrease of the ruminal 400 nitrogen ammonia, methane and acetate concentrations, and an increase of the 401 propionate and butyrate concentrations (28). Changes in these profiles in rumen fluid 402 would also alter the acetate:propionate (C2:C3) proportions. Since butyrate and 403 propionate are important for ruminal papillae development, and especially propionate is 404 used in the gluconeogenesis route (5), a smaller C2:C3 ratio is wanted. In this 405 experiment, BEO supplementation reduced the C2:C3 proportion during the pre-(P \u2264 406 0.05) and postweaning phases (P \u2264 0.05) (Table 4). Confirming these findings, Kazemi-407 Bonchenari et al. (16) registered lower C2:C3 proportion for calves in both groups 408 supplemented with essential oils in starter compared with non-essential oils groups 409 (1.56 and 1.47 -group without essential oils supplementation x 2.02 and 1.77 -group 410 with essential oils supplementation; P < 0.01). However, in our experiment, essential 411 oils were provided mixed in small amounts of MR to ensure the whole intake of the 412 product. This could reduce the chances of essential oils entering the rumen and alter 413 local microbiota as well as VFA. Nevertheless, since the MR amount was small and 414 given at beginning of the feeding, it is possible that the esophageal groove was still 415 open, permitting essential oils content extravasation to the rumen. Akbarian-Tefaghi et 416 al. (27) also found higher C2:C3 proportion during the preweaning phase for calves",
