Previous models of population mortality are based on death over days among infected people, nearly all of whom (to date at least) have underlying conditions.

We estimated the excess number of deaths over 1 year under different COVID-19 incidence rates and differing mortality impacts.",

We used previously validated phenotypes, openly available (https://caliberresearch.org/portal), for each condition using ICD-10 diagnosis, Read, procedure and medication codes. We estimated the 1-year mortality in each condition, and developed simple models of excess COVID-19-related deaths assuming relative risk (RR) of the impact of the emergency (compared to background mortality) of 1.2, 1.5 and 2.0.",

There have been limited reports so far of the excess deaths beyond those expected in specific high-risk populations (3, 4) . The majority of COVID-19 deaths reported so far have occurred in patients with underlying health conditions or at older ages (5-7); this situation is changing (SH personal communication) with severe infections being treated in younger COVID-19 patients without underlying conditions. Case fatality rates(CFR) for COVID-19 vary from 0.27% to 10% according to a metaanalysis(8), possibly explained by differing demography, testing strategies and prevalence of underlying conditions. However, population estimates are lacking, since cases need to be tested and most cases go untested. Moreover, since testing is more common in hospital patients, included individuals are sicker.",

It is currently not known what the overall mortality impact of this emergency, which affects infected and non-infected patients will be. The relative excess in deaths in the winter compared to the summer months in the UK and many other countries is about 20%; our model in effect applies an additional all year round winter effect (i.e. relative risk of 1.2) (15-16). However, it is possible that the relative risk varies during the course of the pandemic, and at high levels of compromise in the workforce and health system, it is likely to be higher due to inability to provide timely care. Given concerns at the clinician and system levels, we therefore modelled an increased risk of mortality associated with COVID-19(RR 1.5 and 2.0).",

We provide readily understandable estimates of background (pre-COVID) 1year risk of death according to number of underlying conditions, by age and sex. This provides context for the daily reports of the numbers of deaths (the 'numerator'); at the time of writing, there are 177 deaths from coronavirus in the UK. It is not widely appreciated that on average 1400 people die every day in the UK (37) . Of all those people dying within 1 year, it is likely that COVID-19 'brings forward' the death earlier in the year. In other words there are competing causes for the mortality. The public may not be used to seeing 'heat maps' of mortality risk which sets the numerator in the context of the population at risk, the denominator but this may change.",

There are many avenues for further modelling to better understand how to target different preventive interventions. An (incomplete) list includes statistical aspects (dynamic models, weekly rates of mortality, competing risks), public health aspects (regional variation, social deprivation and ethnicity), clinical aspects (including hospital and critical care admissions) and health service factors (including data on healthcare workers, and operational features). We have assumed that the impact (RR) of COVID-19 on excess mortality is the same across all risk groups, irrespective of how they are combined, which may not be the case. However, we researchers can use the estimate that we provide to allow modelling of such interactions in different subgroups within populations. We prioritised sharing estimates of 1-year mortality at a time when all clinical academics in the UK and around the globe are being called to the frontline (40) . In these times, our science must cross disciplines, disease specialisms and national and jurisdictional borders even more than before and we invite colleagues to improve, develop and validate our models and update estimates and projections using richer, more real time real-world data.",

Interpretation: We provide the public, researchers and policy makers a simple model to estimate the excess mortality over 1 year from COVID-19, based on underlying conditions at different ages. If the relative mortality impact of COVID-19 were to be about 20% (similar magnitude as the established winter vs summer mortality excess), then the excess deaths would be 0 when 1 in 100 000 (suppression), 13791 when 1 in 10 (mitigation) and 110332 when 8 in 10 are infected (\"do nothing\") scenario.
