This system is needed to achieve early detection of such emergencies. Furthermore, such health awareness system should be capable of predicting the outbreaks patterns to facilitate future countermeasure planning. This health awareness system should cover large scale regions that can be extended to multiple countries, continents and ultimately the globe. Many advanced and industrial countries are still struggling in building such system effectively even with the availability of resources and domain experts. The realization of a reliable health awareness system is accompanied with multiple challenges such as the availability of resources and experts, the global agreements about the system from the legislative and control point of view and the availability of the infrastructure that will support the system functionality with a reasonable cost. This paper presents a novel global health awareness system that overcomes the aforementioned challenges. The system is exploiting the emerging cloud computing services availability over the globe. To handle the large scale requirements, we introduce a multi-tier based cloud system that spans over four tiers starting from the monitored subjects to a centralized global cloud system. Also, we present a mixed integer optimization formulation to tackle the issues related to the latency of detecting outbreaks. Our results show that processing the data in multi-tier health awareness system will reduce the overall delay significantly and enable efficient health data sharing.",

Actually, such awareness system is with great importance for all the countries in the worlds regardless of their health system status.

WBAN is a group of communicating sensors that are wearable or implanted on a human body is called. These sensors communicate wirelessly in order to collect the body's vital signs like heart rate, temperature, blood pressure and blood glucose [7] . Via Bluetooth, the collected data by the sensor nodes are transmitted to on-body smart phone or tablet PCs. The data is then forwarded using cellular or WiFi technology in real time routine to a public cloud provider in order to deliver the needed information to a healthcare service provider like clinic or hospital [8, 9] . WBAN infrastructure is considered as the basic block of our proposed global health awareness system. Fig. 1 shows the proposed healthcare data collection system using WBANs. The required information for the health service is generated in the cloud service provider and using the collected data from the monitored area of WBANs. It depends on the normality of the generated information. The healthcare service provider will take a necessary action if there is any abnormality in the collected information. Otherwise, the cloud service provider will delete the stored data after a certain period of time. The data is called abnormal if it is not within a range that is determined by National Institutes of Health (NIH) [8] .",

A large scale system for monitoring users with smart devices is proposed in this paper and as shown in Fig. 1 . The vital signs of each user are collected and transmitted to the cloud provider [9] using an efficient big data collection model of WBANs system prototype. Having WBAN sensors installed with the textiles that users wear, the users need not worry about their operation. The user will only be required to carry a cell phone and when the system detects serious abnormalities, it will alert the cell phone, which in turn, will automatically call for help. The goal of this system is to provide early detection of dangerous diseases so that the patient will be given medical attention within the first few critical hours, thus greatly improving his or her chances of survival. Moreover, early detection of dangerous diseases will reduce diffusions of such outbreaks [10] .",

First, it provides reliable cloud services supported by advances of cloud deployments and operations flexibility. Second, the proposed system provides scalability, by which it is capable to handle sudden increases (spikes) in demands in a timely manner. This is due to the fact that scaling in and out the resources is efficiently performed within the cloud system. Third, the proposed model facilities an effective data sharing with different stakeholder, such as health organizations and governments officials.

A MapReduce model is composed of a Map process, that is used to filter and sort the data, and a Reduce process that is used to complete the actual operation. For customizing application data, a simple interface holds flexible components consisting of map and reduces process functions. There are many applications that are using MapReduce model, like web and graph traversal, search engines, document clustering, distributed sorting, machine learning, translation machines, cloud and mobile computing [13] .

First, the authors in the literature did not take in consideration the sharing of collected data in large scale setting or the processing time complexity of such data. Second, none of the above works integrate both MapReduce framework and the DBMS to be the concentration of the proposed paradigm, so that the advantages of both frameworks can be realized in this paper. Third, none of the above works integrate data processing, storing, sharing and transmitting with Intercloud as part of global health awareness system, and as a coupled with MapReduce model in multi-tiers cloud provider. In this paper we present a novel global health awareness system with multi-tier cloud provider. Using analytical implemented model, the proposed system optimizes data processing time in multiple tiers in the presence of scalable data collection. In this system three tiers of data processing were proposed, namely, cloudlet, regional cloud and global cloud providers. To analyze and processing big data, we present MapReduce framework in order to schedule, map and reduce the big data in parallel and to reduce the processing time in the different tiers. To the best of our knowledge, the novelty of the proposed work has never been addressed in any previous studies. Moreover, MapReduce in multi-tier scales were never proposed on a large scale as it is fully supported by our proposed MapReduce cloud-based WBANs system. While most of the previous proposed solutions were mainly targeting health related issues, our proposed solution provide a holistic solution that can be deployed in different environments which are not limited to the healthcare systems. Examples of these applications are military, students in school or university, where the deployment of the local cloud depends on the clustering of the users in these applications.",

The public cloud service providers provide their cloud services such as computing capacity, applications and storage to the general public users who are able to access the cloud system service over the internet. The cloud services are offered to the users in similar way as other utilities, such water and electricity. A Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the cloud service provider and the users is used to control the usage mechanism, Quality of Service (QoS) and the incurred cost [26] . Public clouds [27, 28] have several advantages over proprietary or private cloud systems [29] [30] [31] . These advantages include (i) the agility of service deployments in which the services are up and running when we need them, (ii) the low cost of deployment as there is no need to own the hardware or to maintain the system operations and (iii) the widespread availability of such systems in most of the world. Public cloud facilities for data storage and data sharing are needed to support our proposed model. Cloud storage model provides flexibility in storing huge amount of data that is easy to be accessed by different parties from different locations. The access is provided using predefined portals. The cloud storage can be leased from cloud service providers and controlled by SLA . Similar to the computing resources, it can be scaled in and out based on the demands. ",

This can be achieved by load balancing the user's workload especially during the demand spikes. The cloud federation enables the cloud service providers to provide better services quality with less resource by pretending that it owns more resources than it actually has. In our model we are extending the cloud federation one step further to facilitate data processing and data aggregation scheduling in different levels based on the extended geographical footprints, as we will discuss in Section 4 , beside the basic objective of resources pooling. The federation is used to reach important data for our awareness model at their sources of generation (e.g. WBANs or Cloudlets) to enable what we call Processing at the Edge. Processing at the edge is similar to the emerging fog computing [32, 33] , which enables moving the processing and storage of the data to the edge of the network. In the proposed system, the MapReduce processing model is implemented in WBANs, Cloudlets, Regional Cloud Provider or in Global Cloud Provider, as we will discuss in Section 4 . This can be accomplished by redefining the cloud coordinator responsibilities to facilitate centralized and semi-centralized control of different cloud service providers. Cloud coordinator is one of the main enabling mechanisms for cloud federation.",

The system is efficiently handling large scale data collection and processes the data to detect if there is any abnormality in these data. Processing large amount of data from different regions, and deciding if there is any epidemic disease, is considered as the core challenge for many health and non-health applications. The challenge is increased when we talk about the amount of time that it needs to come up with any epidemic conclusion. This is mainly due to the accumulated delay due to the fact that data collection and processing are performed on a huge number of human subjects, as well as the fact that these data are collected from faraway regions. The data collection from the sources can be in the field or in an area suffered from an epidemic disease while the processing can be in a data center that maybe thousands of kilometers far from the data sources, from where a decision can be taken. Another major challenge in this type of applications is how to map the data of interest (i.e. abnormal data) precisely to its exact sources in the field, especially in large scale monitored area. In this work, we introduced an end to end data management framework that efficiently handles these challenges for medical and health applications.

Such mobile device has the ability to communicate with cloud using Cloudlet, Regional Cloud Provider and Global Cloud Provider infrastructures using WiFi or 3G technologies. The number of MS s can be ranged from hundreds to millions, depending on the regions and the density of the monitored area. The size of the monitored area depends on the number of MS s, the covered area by Cloudlet or Regional Cloud Providers [9, 34] . \u2022 Cloudlet tier : It is composed of a local cloud system, which represents inexpensive, resource efficient, easy to deploy and moveable computing system with communication capabilities with MS s and other computing facilities on Regional tier. A Cloudlet consumes less amount of power for processing and communication with an acceptable quality of service compared with Regional and Global Cloud providers [9] . The number of Cloudlets in this tier depends on the size of the monitored area and the number of users. Each Cloudlet can handle data from tens or may be hundreds of MS s in the covered area. The covered area of the Cloudlet is determined by the transmission range of the WiFi technology, as we will discuss in Section 5 .

The abnormal data and the observations are delivered to the health service provider through the Global provider in order to take any action. In each cloud service provider, data will be first stored in a shared storage system that can be used by different processing elements. Then data will be split into a number of slices that are feeding the MapReduce model discussed in Section 1 . In the MapReduce model, the following modules and processing entity are used in order to extract the intermediate pairs of abnormal data from data collector. \u2022 Tasks scheduler : This component is responsible for the data flow and processing assignments for the MapReduce system. It also provides an interface to deploy user defined functions on the data. These user defined functions reflect the objectives of processing the data (e.g. detecting the abnormal data). \u2022 Map phase operations: The Map phase is the first part of the MapReduce processing model. The mappers are a set of high capacity processing elements that receive their input data from the Enterprise cloud (EP) data collector (i.e. usually one slice per mapper). Then, each mapper performs a set of commands (e.g. set of user defined functions) provided by the task scheduler. The mapper also generates a classified data with a predefined set of objectives (i.e. map the input data to these objectives). A map function is used in order to specify a relation between pair of inputs and outputs. The output of the Map phase will be used as input to the Reduce phase for further processing. \u2022 Reduce phase operations : The aim of this phase is to reduce the amount of data that will be used to generate the useful facts or the one to be examined by humans (e.g. physicians, scientists, etc.). The reduce operations are also user defined functions that can be defined by the task scheduler (abnormal data in our case). \u2022 Cloud service provider : It consists of data analyst, decision maker, etc. The cloud service provider receives its input from Global Cloud provider in Tier-4 that is built on top of the health awareness system.",

In this strategy, the collected data is processed in the lower tiers closer to its sources of WBAN. By doing that, we are proposing new innovation method of simulating a large scale data in parallel and using mixed integer-linear programming. In this case the transferred data size is less while the processing delay is larger as we are using a cloud system with lower capacity in the lower tiers.",

For example, T 1 represents a user-defined power weight by which the wearable sensors on WBAN will consume, where studying the amount of this power is out of scope of the paper. Notice that, at any time the data will be processed in only one of the four tiers that we have in the system. In each tier, the total consumed power can be divided into two types. Power is consumed by the IT equipment devices, such as servers, routers, etc., or power consumed by non-IT equipment devices, like the ones that are used for conversation, lighting, cooling, etc. Let's define E usage to be the total consumed powers in the server to the consumed power by the IT devices. E usage is used as a metric for datacenter Power Usage Efficiency (PUE), and it is in the range of 1 \u2264 E usage \u2264 2, which is usually 1.14. To compute the consumed power at the server, let us define P idle be the average consumed power when the server is idle and P peak when it is handling a service request.

For simplicity and due to the scope of the paper, we will ignore the process power at the sensor level and we will consider only the consumed power by the data transmission using the WiFi Technology to cloudlet, as we discussed in Section 1 .

A WiFi is a very popular communication technology for wirelessly data exchange between mobile device and internet using radio waves. Wifi is based on IEEE 802.11 standards [40] which can be capable as Wireless Local Area Network or (WLAN). On the other hand, cellular network is a radio distributed network over areas, where each mobile device is served by access points with transceiver spread in different locations. A cellular network communication allows large number of mobile devices to communicate with fixed transceivers of Internet and with each other. The differences between using these two communication technologies are the followings. A WBAN user with WiFi, is able to transmit the data to the cloud with low delay and low power compared with cellular network technology [41] , but with limited transmission range of 100 m [42] . The successful transmitting data to the cloud service is supported by WiFi capability due to supporting the power constrained in WBAN sensors. In our prototype system, the WiFi technology is available by cloudlet in the covered area. Via WiFi, it was shown that, the transmission delay of 46 Bytes data packet will take roughly 0.045 ms [41, 43] and with a power cost of 30 mw. On the other hand, a cellular network connection (e.g. 3G, 4G and LTE) of longer transmission range, it is capable of sending the data packet to the cloud service from any location that is covered by cellular technology, which is geographically wider in area compared with the covered area of WiFi technology [41, 43] . Via cellular technology, it was shown that the transmission delay of 46 Bytes data packet will take roughly 0.45 ms and with a power cost of 300 mw [41, 43] . Though the WiFi is mostly free of charge in terms of power and delay, the cellular connection is very costly. Cellular connection is very important to support WBANs mobility in case of the absence of WiFi and cloudlet in the area and to support the scalability of the proposed system under large number of WBANs.",

Since we are dealing with a very large scale system, we will focus only on collecting of few vital signs parameters, such as, blood pressure, temperature, blood pressure, heart rate and blood glucose. The collected data from each user is sent by on-body smart phone or tablet pcs to cloudlet in Tier-2 using WiFi communication technology in real-time manner [8, 9] . In our simulation results, the number of users is ranged from 10 0 0 to 1,0 0 0,0 0 0. In the proposed system, we assume that each vital sign measured data from each user follows Normal or Gaussian distribution for a single data generation. While for data arrivals and transmissions it follows M/M/1 queueing system. We used Gaussian distribution for single data generation because it is frequently happening in vital sign and it has a continuous distribution. At the same time, it tells how frequently that the real observation fits between two real threshold values, which is considered as normal range. Then, it will help to detect the abnormal data. Gaussian distribution is very imperative and well known in many studies as statistics analysis for social and ordinary observations using real random variable with unknown distribution [8] . A random distribution N( \u03c4 , \u03c3 2 ) with mean \u03c4 and standard deviation \u03c3 can be implemented using density function",

However, the blood pressure is ranged from 90 to 140 mm/Hg, as a high, and from 60 to 90 mm/Hg, as a low, with averages of 115 mm/Hg and 75 mm/Hg, respectively. The level of Normal blood glucose is ranged from 82 to 110 mg/dL, or 4.4 to 6.1 mmol/L with average of 100 mg/dL. Then, the human heart rate is ranged from 60 to 100 bpm with average of 80 bpm. It should be noticed that, all of these values are matter of changed according to the gender, age or location. The data is called abnormal if it is not within the range that is decided by NIH. In order to detect the abnormality of the measured vital sign, we used threshold-based algorithm, where the data is called abnormal, if it is out of the proposed threshold range.

The delay here is measuring the overall time that the system needs until the health service provider gets the output results from the collected and processed data in global cloud service provider. As we discussed in Section 4 , the total delay depends on the computation delay, from the source of the collected data in WBAN sensors to the global cloud or health service provider. The amount of delay includes data processing delay, queuing delay and transmission delay. The main parameter that may impact on the delay is the number of monitored uses, which represents the covered area. Other parameters that have significant impact on the delay are the number of servers and the capacity of server in each cloud provider in each tier that we have.

Each user sends a data packet with its vital signs every 10 s. The server capacity is set to 10. For simplicity, the collection fraction of data F in each tier is set to 1. The number of cloudlets in each region is set to 10 and the total number of regions is set to 10.

Each data point in the figure represents runs of 10 experiments. The following observations can be made from Fig. 5 . First, increasing the number of data set by monitoring more number of users will increase the delay exponentially at any tier we assigned to process the data. That is because of increasing the transmission delay, queuing delay and processing delay dramatically when the data goes to the upper tiers, as we discussed in Section 4 and Eqs. (12) - ( 15 ) . The second observation that we can made from Fig. 5 is, as the process data goes to the upper tiers, the overall delay is increased. That is because of increasing the number of transmissions to the upper tiers and processing data in lower tiers will reduce the amount of data in queue, which significantly reduce the amount of delay.",

In this paper, integrated data processing, storing, sharing and transmitting with Intercloud as part of global health awareness system has been proposed, and coupled with MapReduce model in multi-tiers cloud provider. Each tier of the system is characterized with different processing capacity and data transfer delay overhead. These characteristics facilitate flexibility in using the system in different scenarios with different requirements. Also, we modeled the system end to end delay as a mixed integer liner programing optimization problem. Our results showed that processing the data in lower tier, like in cloudlet will significantly reduce the overall delay because of reducing the number of transmissions to the upper tiers and processing data in lower tiers will reduce the amount of data in queue, which significantly reduce the amount of delay.",
