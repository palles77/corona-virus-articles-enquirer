The first GHD was organized on 15 October 2008 when more than 120 million children in 73 countries across five continents were mobilized to wash their hands with soap. 6 Since then, 15 October has been designated as GHD, and handwashing promotion activities are organized globally on that day each year.",

We retrieved their Weibo posts regularly via API over the year of 2012. We selected a high-follower-count sample for two reasons. First, Weibo users with a high number of followers are more influential than those with a low follower count, and they frequently attract disproportionately large attention from the public. 13 Second, spam Weibo accounts are very common in China, 20 and our sampling methods minimize their influence (Figure 1 ). Our data set covered the year of 2012, and it is publicly available online. 21 For the purpose of this study, we only performed qualitative analysis on the data from 15 October 2012 containing the Chinese keyword for \"handwashing.\"",
