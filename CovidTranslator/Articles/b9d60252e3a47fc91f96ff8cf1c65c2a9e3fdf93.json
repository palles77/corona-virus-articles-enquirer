As of 18 March 2020, 191 ,127 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been registered worldwide, with 81,116 detected in mainland China and the remainder detected internationally in 156 locations. 4 Because the majority of cases in the early phase of the epidemic were reported in Wuhan, early COVID-19 case definitions and clinical guidelines required individuals suspected of infection to have had a recent travel history from Wuhan. 3, 5 Due to the high travel volume within China in January for the Lunar New Year Spring Festival, it has been suggested that a significant number of COVID-19 cases were introduced to other large cities in China before travel restrictions were instituted on 23 January 2020. 6, 7 The restrictive surveillance case definition used internationally in January suggests that cases of COVID-19 remain potentially undetected in many countries.",

The relatively low number of mean cases estimated to be imported to each of the African countries in our analysis during the total epidemic period may in part be due to the sharp reduction in air-travel volume starting late January to these countries (Supplementary Figure 3) . Figure 1B illustrates the weekly predicted number of imported cases in each of the 6 African countries over time.

This would mean that for each imported and then detected case, 1.8 cases remained undetected due to imperfect detection 3 , and 7.1 additional cases remained undetected due to surveillance focusing on exportation from Wuhan.
