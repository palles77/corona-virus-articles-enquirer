[1] [2] [3] The diagnosis of pneumonia is based on clinical features plus radiological findings consistent with pulmonary infection. 4 Traditionally, chest radiography has been the primary radiographic test used to evaluate for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). 4 However, the use of chest CT imaging to evaluate patients with acute respiratory symptoms has markedly increased during the past 2 decades as clinical practice has evolved to more commonly assess for noninfectious conditions, such as pulmonary embolism and aortic dissection, and to more thoroughly image the lungs for signs of pneumonia. 5, 6 CT imaging is more sensitive than chest radiography for identifying radiological signs of pneumonia, resulting in some patients having pneumonia visualized on CT scans but not on concurrent chest radiographs (CT-only pneumonia). [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] The clinical significance of radiological signs of pneumonia visualized only on CT imaging is largely unknown, creating uncertainty about whether these patients should be managed according to the same principles as those with pneumonia identified on chest radiography or whether CT-only pneumonia is a distinct, less severe disease. 12 The purpose of this study was to compare the pathogens detected, illness severity, and clinical outcomes in patients with CT-only pneumonia and those with pneumonia visualized on chest radiography among adults hospitalized with CAP.",

Initially, patients were enrolled based on interpretation of chest imaging as consistent with acute pneumonia by the clinicians or radiologists interpreting images for routine clinical care. Subsequently, all chest radiographs and CT scans obtained within 48 hours of admission were independently reviewed by a board-certified, study-dedicated thoracic radiologist blinded to the clinical data. The study included two thoracic radiologists (E. M. H. and F. C.), with one reading images from the three Chicago hospitals and the other reading images from the two Nashville hospitals. These radiologists used the same protocol and data collection form when interpreting images and recording their findings.

PCT results were not available to clinicians and were not used for patient management. Prior research suggests a PCT threshold of 0.25 ng/mL can help distinguish between viral and bacterial infection 20, 21 ; therefore, PCT was analyzed on a continuous scale and also dichotomized as < 0.25 ng/mL (low) vs $ 0.25 ng/mL (high).

Detailed evaluation of these 66 patients with CT-only pneumonia revealed illness severity, pathogens, and clinical outcomes similar to those of patients with pneumonia evident on chest radiography. These findings support managing patients with CT-only pneumonia according to the same principles used for those with pneumonia on chest radiography, including the selection of empirical antibiotics and site of care. Additionally, these results suggest that pneumonia that is visible only on CT scan can be associated with significant physiological abnormalities and morbidity, and hence, support using CT imaging to evaluate for pneumonia when the clinical presentation is suggestive of pneumonia but an initial chest radiograph does not demonstrate radiological signs of pneumonia and identification of pneumonia as the cause of clinical symptoms is important. Examples of such a scenario may include patients with septic shock or fever with altered mental status but no clear source of infection after initial evaluation with a history, physical examination, laboratory work, and chest radiography. [32] [33] [34] Currently, nearly all adults hospitalized with CAP in the United States are treated with antibiotics. 13 However, only a minority of these patients have detectable bacterial pathogens. 13 Hence, many antibiotic stewardship strategies are under development to identify patients who historically have been treated with antibiotics but are unlikely to benefit from them. 20, 35 Our results suggest that stewardship strategies are also needed for CT-only pneumonia. We found that 12% of patients with CT-only pneumonia had a bacterial pathogen; this prevalence is too high to recommend withholding antibiotics for all patients with CT-only pneumonia. However, similar to pneumonia on chest radiography, a substantial portion of patients with CT-only pneumonia appear to have nonbacterial disease. Although more research in this area is needed, stewardship strategies developed for pneumonia on chest radiography, such as PCT-based algorithms for guiding antibiotic prescribing, 20 may also be useful for CT-only pneumonia.",

However, it is important to note that 12% of patients with CT-only pneumonia had a bacterial pathogen detected, which was similar to the incidence observed in the pneumonia on chest radiography group. 18% of patients in their study had a chest radiograph suggestive of pneumonia but a CT scan without evidence of pneumonia, and clinicians were likely to discontinue antibiotics and change the disposition from inpatient to outpatient based on results of the CT scan demonstrating no pneumonia. Our data also support a clinical decision to use normal CT scans to de-escalate care based on a chest radiograph suggestive of pneumonia. In our study, only one of 30 patients with a chest radiograph suggestive of pneumonia and a CT scan without evidence of pneumonia had a bacterial pathogen detected, and CT images often clarified the abnormality seen on chest radiograph as a nonpneumonia finding.",

First, the use of CT imaging was determined by treating clinicians independent of the study protocol; clinicians elected to perform CT imaging in approximately one-third of the patients in the cohort. As noted in e- Table 1 , patients with chest pain, shortness of breath, and hemoptysis were more likely to undergo CT imaging, likely due to clinicians' concerns for pulmonary embolism or cancer in patients with these symptoms; therefore, study results may not be generalizable to patients whose clinicians are not concerned enough to order chest CT imaging. Second, because radiological evidence of pneumonia on chest radiography or CT scanning was required for cohort inclusion, we did not evaluate patients with clinically suspected pneumonia who had a chest radiograph without evidence of pneumonia and no CT imaging performed. If CT imaging was systematically completed on these patients, additional cases of CT-only pneumonia would likely have been discovered. Third, patients were considered to have CT-only pneumonia if a CT scan showing evidence of pneumonia was completed on the same day or the day following a chest radiograph that showed no signs of pneumonia, and both imaging studies were completed within 2 days of hospital admission. Only including patients who had a CT scan obtained immediately after a chest radiograph (within minutes or hours) may have decreased the discordance between chest radiography and CT imaging; however, considering a CT scan and chest radiograph performed within 1 calendar day of each other as concurrent imaging is consistent with clinical practice in which routine chest imaging more frequently than once per day is not recommended. 4 Fourth, multiple comparisons between groups were performed, and differences observed should be considered hypothesis generating. Fifth, although this is the largest study to date assessing clinical outcomes of patients with CT-only pneumonia, our sample size was somewhat limited, precluding multivariable analyses and robust comparisons of rare outcomes, such as mortality. Sixth, nearly all patients were treated with antibiotics; hence, the impact of antibiotics on clinical outcomes could not be evaluated. Finally, only hospitalized patients were included in this study, and generalizability to the outpatient setting is unknown.",

While we focused on identifying the pathogens and clinical outcomes of patients with CT-only pneumonia, Claessens et al 7 focused on understanding how CT scans performed in patients with suspected pneumonia changed clinical management. Among the 308 patients with clinically suspected pneumonia in the Claessens et al study, 40 (13%) had CT-only pneumonia, and clinicians typically responded to a positive CT scan for pneumonia after a normal chest radiograph by administering antibiotics. Our results complement those of Claessens et al by suggesting that the pathogens and clinical outcomes associated with CTonly pneumonia do indeed warrant consideration for antibiotic therapy.
