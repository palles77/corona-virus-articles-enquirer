            "text": "Objective: This study presents a preliminary report on the chest radiographic and computed tomography (CT) findings of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pneumonia in Korea. Materials and Methods: As part of a multi-institutional collaboration coordinated by the Korean Society of Thoracic Radiology, we collected nine patients with COVID-19 infections who had undergone chest radiography and CT scans. We analyzed the radiographic and CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia at baseline. Fisher's exact test was used to compare CT findings depending on the shape of pulmonary lesions. Results: Three of the nine patients (33.3%) had parenchymal abnormalities detected by chest radiography, and most of the abnormalities were peripheral consolidations. Chest CT images showed bilateral involvement in eight of the nine patients, and a unilobar reversed halo sign in the other patient. In total, 77 pulmonary lesions were found, including patchy lesions (39%), large confluent lesions (13%), and small nodular lesions (48%). The peripheral and posterior lung fields were involved in 78% and 67% of the lesions, respectively. The lesions were typically ill-defined and were composed of mixed ground-glass opacities and consolidation or pure ground-glass opacities. Patchy to confluent lesions were primarily distributed in the lower lobes (p = 0.040) and along the pleura (p < 0.001), whereas nodular lesions were primarily distributed along the bronchovascular bundles (p = 0.006). Conclusion: COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea primarily manifested as pure to mixed ground-glass opacities with a patchy to confluent or nodular shape in the bilateral peripheral posterior lungs. A considerable proportion of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia had normal chest radiographs.",

As of February 16, there were 29 COVID-19 patients in Korea, placing Korea in fifth place internationally in terms of the number of COVID-19 patients, after China, Singapore (72 patients), Japan (53 patients), and Thailand (34 patients).

The discrepancy in the death rate between China and other countries might be due to differences in the disease manifestation of COVID-19 pneumonia or in other countries' capacity to manage a limited number of cases, in contrast to the overwhelming numbers of cases in China.",

The readers identified all separate pulmonary lesions on CT and analyzed the longest diameter, location, shape, density, and margin of the lesions. The locations of the lesions were specified as lobar, axial, and anteroposterior. For the axial location, the peripheral lung was defined as the outer one-third of the lung, and the central lung was defined as the inner twothirds of the lung. According to a horizontal line dividing the lung into anterior and posterior halves, locations were classified as anterior or posterior. The shapes of the lesions were first categorized as patchy, confluent, or nodular. Patchy lesions were defined as isolated focal lesions with no nodular shape in the segment, and confluent lesions were defined as large fused lesions involving multiple segments. The densities of the patchy to confluent lesions were classified as pure GGO, mixed GGO and consolidation, consolidation, or a crazy-paving appearance. The densities of the nodular lesions were classified as pure GGO, partsolid, or solid. The margins of the lesions were dichotomized as ill-defined or well-defined.

Furthermore, the readers evaluated the presence of air-bronchograms, the reversed halo sign, cavities, micronodules, a tree-in-bud appearance, and pleural effusion based on the Fleischner Society glossary of terms for thoracic imaging (9) .",

Despite the similarities in CT findings, COVID-19 pneumonia seems radiologically milder than SARS and MERS pneumonia. The proportion of patients with abnormal initial radiographic findings was 78.3-82.4% in SARS (15, 16) and 83.6% in MERS (17), but only 33% in our cases of COVID-19 pneumonia. GGO lesions on CT without any consolidation presented in 45% of our cases and in 45-67% of Chinese COVID-19 patients (4, 5) , in 14-40% of MERS patients (10, 11) , and in 50% of SARS patients (12) . The CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in Korea were generally consistent with those of COVID-19 pneumonia in China (4) (5) (6) 18) . However, the proportion of predominantly consolidative lesions in Chinese patients was approximately 30% (4) to 60% (5), but the Korean patients did not have predominantly consolidative lesions. Furthermore, the proportion of chest radiographic abnormalities was 60% in Chinese COVID-19 patients (19) , but 33% in Korean patients. Considering these radiologic observations and the lack of deaths from COVID-19 in Korea, Korean patients seem to experience a milder disease course than Chinese patients.",

First, the number of included patients was small, and the included patients only accounted for approximately one-third of all 29 identified patients of COVID-19 in Korea as of February 16, 2020. Including more patients would enable a more comprehensive description of the radiologic findings of COVID-19. However, we weighed this consideration against the importance of urgent reporting. Second, we focused on baseline CT findings that clinicians and radiologists first encountered, rather than findings from follow-up CT scans, as follow-up CT scans were performed in few patients. Third, we minimized the clinical information of the patients, as a substantial proportion of the included patients were receiving inpatient treatment at the time of the analysis.",
