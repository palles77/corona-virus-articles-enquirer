During both the 7 days before and after the viral detection, when compared with symptomatic infants, asymptomatic infants spent significantly less time with SpO 2 < 85%. However, during the 7 days pre-viral and postviral detection, the daily time spent with SpO 2 < 85% remained similar within the asymptomatic group. Similarly, the daily time spent with SpO 2 < 85% remained similar over time within the symptomatic group. There are several possible explanations for these findings. Symptomatic infants may have had worse baseline lung disease prior to viral detection and thus were at increased risk of becoming symptomatic with the viral infection. Symptomatic infants may have been hypoxemic due to a respiratory viral infection several days prior to being tested. Asymptomatic infants may have had undiagnosed respiratory viral infections previously, and positive tests may have reflected nonviable viruses or viral shedding. Nonetheless, the clinical utility of BedMasterEx data should be further examined in a larger sample of infants to determine if subclinical viral illness can be predicted, thereby prompting earlier testing and potentially reducing transmission.",

As support for the importance of this priority, during this same time period, 46 central line-associated bloodstream infections occurred in our NICU compared with the 86 episodes of respiratory viral detection described in this study. However, optimal IP&C strategies for respiratory viruses in the NICU population are unknown and highly variable as demonstrated in a nationwide study conducted in the United Kingdom [25] . Our data suggest that a combination of IP&C strategies including excluding family members with illnesses, excluding visitors less than 12 years of age year-round, and screening asymptomatic infants in close proximity to an infant with a respiratory virus decreases the transmission event rates, although our sample may have been too small to assess the sustained effect of the interventions over time. Excluding sibling visitors and screeningexposed infants are practices that have been implemented in some NICUs in the U.K [25] and others have shown that restricting sibling visitors reduced RSV [26] . While these interventions were associated with reducing transmission events in our NICU, they did not eliminate respiratory viruses. There are likely multiple 'portals of entry' for respiratory viruses, including unrecognized ill visitors and HCP, adults who are infectious prior to the onset of symptoms, and/or asymptomatic adult or infant carriers shedding viruses [4, 27] .",

Furthermore, our NICU admits full-term infants with congenital anomalies as well as older infants for ROP and BPD management; these admission patterns help to elucidate the relatively older chronologic age of our study population. The overall sample size was small and we could not demonstrate factors associated with being symptomatic vs. asymptomatic, including the distribution of different viruses. The frequency of asymptomatic infants was likely underestimated because the practice for testing exposed infants was not conducted throughout the 5-year study period and we did not test unexposed, asymptomatic infants. It is also possible that unknown confounders or unexamined variables, such as viral load or patterns of care by specific HCP may be responsible for the observed clinical courses of infants in this study. We may have misclassified RV/EV transmission as the Biofire RVP does not distinguish specific virus types nor were the viruses sequenced. We also acknowledge that our strategy to discontinue transmission precautions if an infant has two negative tests does not consider intermittent viral shedding. Finally, we did not measure the impact of culture change in the NICU; following the adenovirus outbreak, staff had increased awareness of the clinical impact of respiratory viruses resulting in increased responsibility and accountability among staff to not work while ill themselves and to ask peers with respiratory symptoms to be evaluated by WH&S.",

Infants in the NICU with respiratory viruses can exhibit a wide range of symptoms including being asymptomatic, as demonstrated by both clinical and physiological data. Remarkably, we found that most symptomatic infants did not receive escalation of respiratory or nutritional support. While the evidence supporting effective infection prevention and control measures is still evolving, we found that screening asymptomatic infants after exposure and prohibiting visitors less than 12 years of age from visiting the NICU were associated with a reduction in incidence and transmission events of respiratory viruses. However, multicenter investigations are needed to assess the generalizability of our findings to identify factors associated with asymptomatic infants and to determine the most cost-effective IP&C strategies to reduce respiratory viruses in the NICU.",
