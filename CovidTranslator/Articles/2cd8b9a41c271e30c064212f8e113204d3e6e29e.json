            "text": "1 Introduction 1 Outbreaks of infectious diseases trigger an increase in scientific research and output. Early in 2 outbreaks, evidence is scarce, however, it accumulates rapidly as time progresses. As we are continuously 3 facing new disease outbreaks, as we do at the moment with the emergence of the new coronavirus 4 (SARS-nCoV-2), understanding the accumulation of evidence is vital. Here, we describe the 5 accumulation of evidence during the Zika virus outbreak and summarize the lessons learnt. 6 Causality is a principal theme in epidemiological research. Establishing that an exposure causes a 7 specific health outcome is based on evidence and may inform guidance about public health measures. 8 The concepts and types of evidence required to conclude that an association is causal are the subject of 9 ongoing debate. Vandenbroucke proposed a hierarchy of evidence based on the best chance for discovery 10 and explanation of phenomena [1] . Observations published in case reports and case series, or findings in 11 data and literature drive discovery. Verification of these discoveries happens in observational studies and 12 in randomized controlled trials, given that exposures can be randomized. The value of evidence used for 13 public health guidance is thought to follow an inverse pattern of the hierarchy for discovery; here, case reports and other anecdotal evidence is considered to be evidence that provides the least certainty on an 15 effect or association. Cohort studies, randomized controlled trials and case-control studies are considered 16 to provide evidence with a higher certainty (Figure 1 ). 17 The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Pacific and the Americas between 2013--2016 presented 18 several aetiological causal questions. In 2013-2014, ZIKV caused an outbreak in French Polynesia [2, 3] . 19 During this period, investigators documented some severe neurological conditions, including 40 people 20 with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS). GBS is usually a rare sporadic condition. Often triggered by 21 infection, an autoimmune response affects the peripheral nerves, leading ascending paralysis, which can 22 be fatal if it involves the respiratory nerves [4] . At the time, the reports did not attract much attention 23 and the investigators refrained from making a causal connection because dengue was also circulating at 24 the time [3] . In November 2015, the ministry of health in Brazil reported a cluster of births affected by 25 microcephaly in the north east. Microcephaly is a birth defect, indicative of impaired brain development, 26 which can be caused by congenital infection. At around the same time, ZIKV had been identified for the 27 February 2016 because of the severity of these clinical conditions and their temporal association with 32 ZIKV circulation [7] . Retrospective assessment of the French Polynesia outbreak identified an increase in 33 adverse congenital outcomes as well [8] . The PHEIC and the extensive outbreak catalysed the research 34 on ZIKV. Early public health guidance about the prevention of ZIKV infection and its potential 35 consequences was based on limited evidence, however [9] .",

These study designs are often excluded from systematic reviews 49 because they are the lowest level of the \"hierarchy of evidence\" that applies to evaluation research. 50 Vandenbroucke proposed a reverse hierarchy for discovery in which 'anecdotal' forms of evidence are at 51 the top [1] .

We did 146 not quantify several factors that likely influence this duration such as the size of the outbreak, the 147 research capacity or outbreak preparedness. Small outbreaks or small population sizes limit the 148 opportunity to enrol sufficient patients with adverse outcomes, and unless involved in 149 multi-centre/multi-region studies, these regions are less likely to produce high quality epidemiological 150 studies. The same holds true for regions with limited research capacity, such as appropriate diagnostic 151 facilities and expertise. Outbreak preparedness likely increased over time, with funding increasing after 152 the PHEIC, meaning that initiation of studies started relatively late for regions that were affected 153 earliest by the outbreak.

Here, different frameworks can help us 206 assess the evidence such as Bradford Hill dimensions [11] . We rely on a wide spectrum of evidence in line 207 with how Krieger et al. phrase it: \"Robust causal inference instead comprises a complex narrative, 208 created by scientists appraising, from diverse perspectives, different strands of evidence produced by 209 myriad methods.\" [26] . Rapid consensus on causality is often needed to form public health guidance. 210 Not all outbreaks generate the same emerging causal questions, thus deconstructing other causal 211 problems based on study design and timing of evidence will provide more insight in how evidence 212 accumulates. The ZIKV outbreak in the Americas was unique by its size; making rare 213 non-pathognomonic outcomes visible. Also, the 2015-2017 outbreak in the Americas benefited from the 214 outbreak in 2013 in French Polynesia. Much data was collected there, and retrospective analyses 215 confirmed the association between ZIKV infection and adverse outcomes [8] . This resulted in the 216 publication of a case-control study on GBS, rapidly after the declaration of the PHEIC [8] . Likewise, 217 Cauchemez et al. used a modelling approach to estimate the risk of adverse congenital outcomes in 218 French Polynesia retrospectively [27] . As the SARS-nCoV-2 outbreak continues to unfold, we will apply the same methodology as discussed 221 here to keep track of the accumulation of evidence, the delay in publication and the use of pre-print 222 publishing.

The declaration of the Ministry of Health of Brazil in November 2015 [5] 181 and the declaration of the PHEIC by WHO in February 2016 [7] catalysed the ZIKV research effort 182 across many different disciplines and resulted in an increase in research funding and a WHO-initiated 183 research agenda [21].
