Application of these methods spans a wide range, from drug target identification to hit discovery and lead optimization. In this review, we firstly provide an overview of China's status in this field and briefly analyze the possible reasons for this rapid advancement. The methodology development is then outlined. For each selected method, a short background precedes an assessment of the method with respect to the needs of drug discovery, and, in particular, work from China is highlighted. Furthermore, several successful applications of these methods are illustrated. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of current major challenges and future directions of the field.",

With consistent financial support from the government and tremendous research effort, the overall research level of China in this field continues to advance. This trend can be partially revealed by a brief analysis of the research output over the past few years. Taking the structure-based drug design (SBDD) as an example, the publication of scientific papers from China during 2006 to 2010 ranked fifth (citation ranking is seventh), only behind the USA, the UK, Germany, France, and Italy. Among Asian countries, China ranked the top in both the number of publications and citations [1] . Currently, more than 80 universities and research institutions in China have established drug design research departments or centers and over 100 domestic research groups are engaged in drug design. The main reason for the rapid advancement of research should be ascribed to the major breakthrough in methodology and software development.",

As of 2006, there were only 324 identified molecular targets for FDA-approved drugs [2] . Although this total figure is under debate, it is significantly lower than the number of proteins unveiled by the completion of human and numerous pathogen genomes, of which many can be potentially druggable [3] . Moreover, many drugs elicit their therapeutic activities by modulating multiple targets, but the multi-target interactions are either largely unknown or insufficiently understood in most cases. The use of computational tools to predict protein targets of small molecules has been gaining importance in recent years. One of the computational approaches demonstrated to be efficient and cost effective in target identification is 'reverse' docking [4] [5] [6] . Molecular docking is a method to predict the predominant binding mode(s) of a ligand with a protein of known 3D structure, which is routinely used in structure-based drug discovery for hit identification (VS) and lead optimization. More details about the method are provided in the section 'Protein-ligand interaction'.

A comparison of these two paradigms is shown in Figure 1 . The identified protein 'hit' can then serve as a potential candidate target for experimental validation. Li et al. presented such a computational tool named 'Target Fishing Dock' (TarFisDock) [6] , which consists of a front-end web interface and a back-end using DOCK [7] for reverse docking. A feature of this work is a companion potential drug target database (PDTD) containing 1207 entries and 841 potential drug targets [8] . The repository of drug targets can be categorized into 14 types according to their therapeutic areas, constituting a comprehensive and valuable source for identifying potential targets of small molecules. By searching through PDTD, TarFisDock can not only predict potential binding targets for a given small molecule but also provide valuable information about their related diseases, biological functions, and regulating (signaling) pathways. So far, TarFisDock has been used for evaluating over 5000 small molecules by more than 2497 users from over 30 countries and regions. Some of the predicted results have been verified by bioassay and crystallographic studies [9] [10] [11] .",

Moreover, they heavily rely on the available 3D structures of the targets and a priori knowledge about the ligand binding sites. As a result, these methods are not appropriate for assessing a large batch of small molecules. Pharmacophore modeling is another frequently used technique in drug hit discovery, which usually requires less time to screen a ligand than docking. It measures to what extent a query molecule possesses the spatial arrangement of features essential for protein-ligand interaction. Similar to molecular docking, this approach can also be used 'in reverse' to screen a given small molecule against a collection of predefined pharmacophores representing different targets and binding sites. Recently, Liu et al. reported a free web server that hosts a large repertoire of pharmacophores essential for interaction modes between ligand probe and potential targets, entitled PharmMapper [12] . A total of 7302 pharmacophores were constructed by using a protein structure-based modeling approach [13] . Given the query of a small molecule, PharmMapper automatically starts the procedure of reverse mapping against the deposited models and outputs the top ranked hits. Owing to its high throughput ability, PharmMapper can be used for large-scale target screening to profile the regulation genomic network.",

This ability makes miRNA a promising technology for future therapeutic development because dysregulation of miRNA function and the changes in miRNA expression level are related to many disorders, including cancers, metabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, it is of particular interest to reliably predict potential miRNA targets which might be involved in these diseases [15, 16] . In mammals, miRNAs associate with members of the Argonaute (Ago) protein family, and function in multi-protein complexes to direct mRNA cleavage or repress the translation of complementary RNAs [17] . However, molecular details about the interactions between miRNAs and their target RNAs associating with Ago are lacking. Wang et al. analyzed RNA-bound and RNA-free Ago forms by performing molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and binding free energy calculation [18] . Pang et al. investigated the role of miR-NAs in choriocarcinoma, through the combined usage of in silico miRNA target prediction, luciferase functional assays, and western blotting analysis. Their study demonstrated that miR-34a is a tumor suppressive miRNA in choriocarcinoma cells that may be used as a therapeutic target for treating choriocarcinoma [19] . Recently, some computational approaches have been developed for the prediction of miRNA targets. Chou et al. reported a systematic approach to identify miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) by mining miRNA-target sites from crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced CLIP (PAR-CLIP) sequencing data, namely miRTarCLIP [20] . The workflow was integrated into a web-based browser to provide a user-friendly interface and detailed annotations of MTIs.",

This concept is also known as drug repositioning (also known as drug repurposing or reprofiling) and has gained considerable attention recently [22, 23] . Because the starting point in drug repositioning is usually approved drugs with known bioavailability and safety profiles, this approach can significantly reduce the failure risks associated with drug development and potentially facilitate the repositioned compounds to enter clinical phases more rapidly and less costly than new chemical entities [24] . Given that most of the repositioned drugs currently in the market are discovered by chance [25] , it is of great interest to develop computational methods to rationalize and facilitate the process. The knowledge about interactions between proteins and small molecules is essential for developing drug repositioning tools.

New drug-target interactions for five known drugs were predicted and confirmed by in vitro assays. One restriction of NBI is that it is only suitable for those drugs having initial links to targets in the network. To tackle this problem, they further developed edgeweighted NBI (EWNBI) and node-weighted NBI (NWNBI) integrating both NBI and similarity strategies [35] . One significant advantage of these proposed approaches is that they are able to predict protein targets of small molecules even if the 3D structures of both the protein and the small molecule are unknown. Similar to the above-mentioned drug target prediction approaches, they have potential values in gaining insights into the promiscuous nature of the drug.",

Evaluation of some frequently used docking programs can be found elsewhere [37, 38] . There are general trends that accuracy is system-dependent, suggesting that the tested methods are specific for particular protein families. Significant progress has been presented by several research groups in China recently. GAsDock developed by Li et al. is an ultra-fast and flexible docking program [39] . It features a conformation-sampling algorithm that utilizes an entropy-based genetic algorithm to optimize the binding poses of small molecules. To further increase the accuracy and speed of the program, Li et al. subsequently developed a new optimization model based on an improved adaptive genetic algorithm [40] . Some techniques including a multi-population genetic strategy and a new iteration scheme were adopted. The model showed reasonable predictive accuracy on reproducing the native binding poses and the docking time is in proportion to the number of rotatable bonds of the ligands. As a continuation of previous work, they also presented two multi-objective optimization methods (MOSFOM) [41] , in which the solution will simultaneously satisfy energy and shape complementarity goals, effectively enhancing the performance as compared with those with a single score (GAsDock). Instead of accurately predicting the binding free energy, MOSFOM could yield reasonably ranked binding poses on eliminating the conformations that cannot satisfy the overall objective functions.",

There is increasing experimental evidence showing that many proteins may undergo significant conformation changes upon ligand binding. Traditional docking methods assume the rigidity of protein, and consequently their accuracy is limited for the 'induced-fit' protein-ligand systems. However, owing to the large size and many degrees of freedom of proteins, the computational complexity of algorithms accounting for protein flexibility increases dramatically. Several approximations have been frequently used to account for protein flexibility, including soft docking, side chain flexibility, molecular relaxation, and protein ensemble docking. Koska et al. proposed a two-stage protein flexible docking protocol that models flexibility of the protein before and after ligand placement [42] . The protein side chain conformations are firstly calculated, and low energy poses of ligands are obtained by docking and computing binding site hotspots. Then, side chains of the protein are refined and an energy minimization of the ligand pose in the presence of the protein is performed. Sherman et al. presented a novel procedure for modeling ligand-receptor induced fit effects. Both ligand and protein flexibility are accurately considered by iteratively combining rigid receptor docking (Glide) with protein structure prediction (Prime) techniques. Compared with traditional rigid receptor docking, this approach showed a significantly improved success rate in reproducing correct ligand binding poses on a test set containing 21 pharmaceutically relevant examples [43] . Although this flexible docking procedure mainly focuses on the flexibility of protein side chains, it can be extended to consider backbone motions by incorporating a loop prediction module.",

            "text": "Scoring poses another major obstacle for the reliability of molecular docking. The current scoring functions for docking are typically classified into force field-based, empirical, and knowledge-based [36] . Force-field based methods employ classical molecular mechanical models to compute the direct noncovalent interactions between the protein and ligand, such as van der Waals and electrostatic energies. Empirical scoring functions, by contrast, decompose the overall interactions into different energetic terms and obtain their weight factors by regression analyses on experimental protein-ligand binding affinities. Generally, force-field methods have wider applicability and empirical scoring functions can make a more accurate prediction within the range of regression model. For knowledge-based methods, 'knowledge' means structural information from experimentally determined protein-ligand complexes. This type of method uses the Boltzmann law to transform the atom pair preferences into distance-dependent pairwise potentials. The results usually show reasonable accuracy in reproducing the experimental binding poses, but are less accurate on approximating binding free energy [44] . Shen et al. reported an improved knowledge-based scoring function named IPMF [45] . Typically, the knowledge-based functions are developed by applying the Boltzmann law to transform the atom pair preferences into distance-dependent pairwise potentials. In addition to structural information, IPMF integrated experimental binding affinity information into the extracted potentials via an iteration optimization approach. It was found that the scoring function with the 'enriched' knowledge might achieve increased accuracy in binding affinity prediction. Compared with seven commonly used scoring functions on a third party test set containing 219 diverse protein-ligand complexes, IPMF performed best in predicting the binding affinity. With the rapid growing volume of high-quality structural and protein-ligand interaction data in the public domain, this work represents a positive step towards improving the accuracy of scoring in binding affinity prediction.",

Following the frequently used similarity concept, it assumes that molecules of shape and chemistry comparable to known active agents have a significant probability to show similar biological activities. The definition of shape similarity is usually derived from the alignment that achieves an optimal overlap of 3D structures of compounds, where the metric distance is the mismatch volume. Many application studies revealed that shapebased VS can result in good enrichment of active compounds and, meanwhile, sufficient diversity in the discovered compounds. As suggested by the comparative study of Hawkins et al., shape matching showed better VS performance than molecular docking in some test cases [51] . Liu et al. reported a useful VS tool named SHAFTS (SHApe FeaTure Similarity) [52] , which is a hybrid approach for 3D molecular similarity searching by comparing both molecular shape and pharmacophore features. SHAFTS performs rigid body superimposition of 3D molecular models and can use single or multiple bioactive compounds as the query 'templates'. On the basis of a feature triplet hashing algorithm, SHAFTS can efficiently perform rigid body superimposition of 3D molecular models for query and bioactive compounds. Compared with other ligand-based VS methods, it can also achieve a superior performance in enrichment assessment, which measures the number of active compounds found by employing a certain VS strategy as opposed to the number found by random sampling. These results suggest that SHAFTS is suitable for large-scale VS and prospectively exploring potential mechanisms for drug side effects.",

Therefore, it is important to assess hERG binding of compounds in the early phase of drug discovery [67, 68] . On the basis of a diverse set of 806 compounds, Wang et al. developed a ligand-based classification model for hERG blockade prediction [69] . The model achieved over 85% accuracy for one internal and two external test sets. Moreover, some important structural fragments favorable or unfavorable for hERG channel inhibition were highlighted. Accurate prediction of hERG inhibitory potency can offer the possibility of screening and optimizing hit compounds to eliminate potentially lethal side effects. Although a full crystal structure for hERG is not yet available, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of structure-based models for hERG blockers. Recently, Di Martino et al. developed and validated an automated docking protocol that quantitatively characterizes the binding of a series of hERG channel blockers [70] . This approach turned out to be successful in both increasing the consistency of the docked binding modes and explaining the structure-activity relationships for the blockers. Clearly, as the 3D structures of some major ADME/T-related proteins become available, structure-based models will play an increasingly important role in this field [71] .",

Because the molecular targets of many natural products remain unknown, unraveling the target or targets for a natural compound should provide insights into its molecular mechanism(s) and help in optimizing its potency and selectivity. The pathogenic bacterium Helicobacter pylori is a major causative factor for gastrointestinal illnesses. A natural product isolated from Ceratostigma willmottianum, a folk medicine used to remedy rheumatism, traumatic injury, and parotitis, was found effective in inhibiting the bacterium. However, the specific mechanism of action of the compound is unknown. Cai et al. used this compound as a probe to search PDTD with TarFisDock [9] . In total, 15 putative interacting proteins were found, among which diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DC) and peptide deformylase (PDF) showed a shared sequence homology to H. pylori. Particularly, the sequence of H. pylori PDF (HpPDF) shares 40% identity with that of Escherichia coli PDF. The interaction between the natural product and these two proteins was experimentally evaluated. Enzymatic assays demonstrated that the natural product and one of its analogs are potent inhibitors against HpPDF, with IC 50 values of 10.8 and 1.25 mM, respectively. Moreover, the later determined Xray crystal structures of apo-HpPDF and inhibitor-HpPDF complexes were confirmed at the atomic level. This study reveals that HpPDF is a potential target for anti-H.",

Eventually, 15 out of 39 purchased compounds exhibited inhibitory activity in enzymatic assessment. Strikingly, the two most potent inhibitors not only demonstrated excellent inhibitory potency (IC 50 = 57 and 61 nM, respectively) but also presented considerable selectivity over the insulin receptor (IR) that is highly homological to IGF-1R [77] .

Because it is an old drug that is cheap and has an established safety record, cinanserin could be used as an emergency treatment or for stockpiling for future SARS pandemics. This is a paradigm for repurposing an existing drug, which provides a cost-effective new way of tackling a devastating disease.",

Liu et al. reported applying SHAFTS to the discovery of novel inhibitors for p90 ribosomal S6 protein kinase 2 (RSK2), which plays a pivotal role in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. SHAFTS was used to perform 3D similarity searching by adopting two weak inhibitors as query templates. Sixteen compounds were discovered with IC 50 < 20 mM, three of which showed low micromolar inhibitory activities against RSK2 and exhibited selectivity across a panel of related kinases [80] . In contrast to this, these new scaffolds were not identified by conventional 2D fingerprint methods. The result suggests that SHAFTS is an efficient and powerful tool in scaffoldhopping and hit identification endeavors.",

It is also reported to be a promising target for cardiovascular, immunosuppressive, and cancer therapy. Initially, Li et al. designed a focused library by LD1.0 on the basis of the previously reported CypA inhibitors and selected 16 compounds for synthesis. All 16 compounds were CypA binders with dissociation constants (K d ) ranging from 0.076 to 41.0 mM, and five compounds showed PPIase inhibitory activities (IC 50 ) of 0.25-6.43 mM [83] . The hit rates for binders and inhibitors were as high as 100% and 31.25%, respectively. Encouraged by the results, the authors continued the study with an acylurea linker that was previously identified crucial to CypA ligand binding. The de novo drug design program LigBuilder 2.0 was customized to generate inhibitors that incorporate the complementary properties and fit the shape of the CypA binding site. A potent inhibitor with IC 50 of 31.6 nM was firstly obtained. Then, after two rounds of structure-activity analyses (SAR) and chemical modifications, two highly potent CypA inhibitors with nanomolar inhibitory potencies (2.59 nM and 1.52 nM) were obtained out of 19 synthesized compounds [84] . These promising results clearly demonstrate that the LD1.0 and the de novo method LigBuilder 2.0 are powerful tools for lead optimization.",

            "text": "The year 2012 marked three decades of protein structurebased drug design, since the first docking program, DOCK, was published in 1982 by Kuntz et al. [85] . A special issue published in the Journal of Computer-Aided Molecular Design reflected on 25 years of molecular design and it was concluded that new compounds are 'easy to design but challenging in evaluation' [86] . Medicinal chemists use a variety of computational approaches to modify the chemical structure of a compound to maximize its in vitro activity. However, good in vitro activity cannot be extrapolated to good in vivo activity without the understanding of pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism properties. Even at the protein-ligand binding level, it is challenging to predict the efficacy of a ligand. Traditionally, drug discovery is driven by the idea that a ligand with higher binding affinity to a target should be more efficacious than that with lower binding affinity to the same target. It is clear that the efficacy of a drug is not only associated with thermodynamics but also related to the binding kinetics between the drug and a defined target. Numerous examples demonstrated that drug efficacy does not always linearly correlate with binding affinity. In particular, there is now a renewed emphasis to ligand-receptor binding kinetics in almost all steps along the drug research and development (R&D) pipeline. Similar to experimental approaches for drug discovery, the current computational drug design methods focus on maximizing ligand-binding affinity, which are either fast-but-inaccurate or slow-butaccurate. This situation tends to change with the development of a binding kinetics-emphasized paradigm. Drug efficacy mainly depends on the drug-target residence time t, calculated from k off -the dissociation rate constant (t = 1/ k off ). Despite more than 30 years of effort, predicting binding free energies for ligands interacting with targets with sufficient accuracy (within AE 3 kcal/mol) is still an unsolved problem due to the time-consuming free energy perturbation calculation and crude docking result, not to mention calculating k off .",

This enables both binding affinity and binding kinetics to be accurately estimated, and possible binding (unbinding) pathway(s) may be obtained as well. We applied this method to simulate the binding event of the anti-Alzheimer's disease drug (-)-Huperzine A (HupA) to its target acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The computational results are in excellent agreement with the concurrent experimental measurements. All predicted values of binding free energy and activation free energies of association and dissociation only deviate from the experimental data by less than 1 kcal/mol.

Over the past decades, there has been significant progress in China in both development and application of novel methodologies. These methods streamline many aspects of drug discovery, from hit screening and lead optimization to drug target identification and ADME/T assessment. In future development, it is necessary to establish a research pattern that is oriented by computational analyses and brings into full play chemistry, biology, and other disciplines with Review Trends in Pharmacological Sciences October 2013, Vol. 34, No. 10 complementary strengths. In particular, the philosophy embodied in CDDD is shifting from 'one gene, one drug, and one disease' to 'multicomponent therapeutics, network targets'. Accordingly, the emerging discipline of network pharmacology [88] , which combines network biology with chemogenomics, makes notable impact on the fundamental challenges of traditional medicines for complex diseases. Under the new paradigm, CDDD will play an even more pivotal role in discovering lead compounds with the desired polypharmacological profiles, and systematic data mining to elucidate synergistic effects, side effects, and to understand the promiscuity of drugs.",
