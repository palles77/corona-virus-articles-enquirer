We have studied the protective effects of the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 10415 (E. faecium), which is approved as a feed additive in the European Union, against TGEV infection. E. faecium was added to swine testicle (ST) cells before, concomitantly with, or after TGEV infection. Viability assays revealed that E. faecium led to a dose-dependent rescue of viability of TGEV-infected cells reaching nearly to complete protection. Virus yields of the E. faecium-treated cultures were reduced by up to three log 10 units. Western blot analysis of purified TGEV revealed that the levels of all viral structural proteins were reduced after E. faecium treatment. Using transmission electron microscopy, we observed attachment of TGEV particles to the surface of E. faecium which might be a means to trap virus and to prevent infection. Increased production of nitric oxide in the cells treated with E. faecium and elevated expression of interleukin 6 and 8 pointed to stimulated cellular defense as a mechanism to fight TGEV infection.",

The appearance of the closely related TGEV variant porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV) has been found beneficial in preventing TGEV infections, possibly through induction of neutralizing antibodies that can provide crossprotection against TGEV infection [34, 39] . However, TGE prevalence is still being reported, and some TGEV strains have been isolated from domestic pigs in different parts of the world [28] . Commercially available vaccines, either inactivated or attenuated, have failed to provide full protection to piglets [38] . It is likely that the parentally applied inactivated viruses do not induce the local immune response in the small intestine that is required for protection. Therefore, the discovery and development of new, highly potent anti-TGEV agents and effective approaches for controlling the emergence of TGEV infection remains an important mission.",

This most pronounced antiviral activity most likely resulted from the sum of overlapping mechanisms at different time points before and after virus infection, as shown before, including The finding that the levels of all of the viral structural proteins were equivalently reduced after E. faecium treatment (Fig. 5) indicates that indeed fewer TGEV particles were released from these infected cells. Likewise, reduced synthesis of TGEV proteins may decrease the amount of virus-induced damage and subsequently also ameliorate the cytopathic effect in virus-infected ST cells, which logically must lead to a rescue of cell viability.",

We found that E. faecium could significantly induce NO release ( Table 2 ). The antiviral effects of NO have been well studied for several viral infections [1, 8, [15] [16] [17] . Although NO production is believed to be released mainly in macrophages, we did detect an increase of NO release in ST cells upon treatment with E. faecium and TGEV, and this release of NO was dose dependent. This indicates that an induction of iNOS could indeed play a role in the mechanisms for our observation that E. faecium inhibits TGEV infection in ST cells. For the competition assay, we also compared expression of the antiviral cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. TGEV infection of ST cells without E. faecium did not significantly increased expression when compared to mock control. However, E. faecium treatment significantly increased the production of pro-inflammatory factors IL-6 and IL-8 in TGEV-infected ST cells. This result is consistent with those of other authors [14, 19, 25, 30, 40] , who showed IL-6 or IL-8 production following the interaction of probiotics with the intestinal epithelium. Because IL-6 and IL-8 responses in intestinal epithelial cells play important roles in the pathogenesis and immune defense against enteric pathogens [21] , the increased level of those cytokines could also possibly indicate an enhanced innate response.",

The data suggest that E. faecium may serve as a useful antiviral agent against infection with TGEV and possibly other viruses. Challenge experiments with different porcine viruses in piglets are under way to substantiate this hypothesis.",
