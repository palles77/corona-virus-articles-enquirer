It has been estimated that older subjects spend approximately 19 to 20 h/d indoors. Older individuals may be particularly at risk for detrimental effects from pollutants, even at low concentrations, due to reduced immunological defenses and multiple underlying chronic diseases. Six Porto, Portugal, urban area elderly care centers (ECC), housing a total of 425 older persons, were studied to assess indoor air quality (IAQ) and thermal comfort (TC) in two seasons. This study presents the IAQ and TC results in 36 rooms and constitutes part of a wider and ongoing study. The study areas were all naturally ventilated, and indoor concentrations in winter were within Portuguese reference values. However, 42% of the participants were dissatisfied with indoor thermal conditions, rating it \"slightly cool.\" In summer, the index rate of dissatisfied individuals was lower (8%). Significant differences were found between seasons in predicted percent of dissatisfied people (PPD) and predicted mean vote (PMV) indices. Fungal concentrations frequently exceeded reference levels (>500 colony-forming units [CFU]/m 3 ). In addition, other pollutants occasionally exceeded reference levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Portugal to assess effects of indoor air contaminants on the health status and quality of life in older subjects living in ECC. Although IAQ and TC parameters were mostly within reference values, the results suggest a need to improve the balance between IAQ and TC in ECC, a critical environment housing a susceptible population.",

As levels of outdoor ambient pollution have decreased in many areas, the relative impact of indoor air pollution has grown, and thus indoor air quality (IAQ) has increasingly gained importance. Indoor environments are often considered to be among the healthiest and safest places, particularly for older individuals who possess unique health needs and environmental sensitivities. In addition to IAQ, thermal comfort (TC) is a key indoor factor that might affect comfort, health, and performance. TC is chiefly determined by temperature, humidity, and air",

Many factors may affect health and quality of life, pollutant exposure, and an individual's response to these stimuli. While considerable evidence indicates that low concentrations of air pollutants are associated with increased risks of morbidity and mortality, particularly for respiratory and cardiovascular disease and cancer (Pope and Dockery, 2006; Miller et al., 2007; Krewski et al, 2004; Samet and Krewski, 2007) , information on the elderly in indoor settings is limited. Adverse health effects associated with indoor air pollutants were investigated among some susceptible populations, especially children (Neas et al., 1994; Nafstad et al., 1996; 1997; Bruce et al., 2000; Jaakkola et al., 2001; Jaakkola and Jaakkola, 2002; Foos et al, 2008; Selgrade et al, 2008; Madureira et al., 2009) . However, few studies evaluated adults and older people (Xu and Wang, 1993; Moran et al., 1999; Pilloto et al., 1999; Venners et al., 2001; Simoni et al., 2003) . No apparent study was identified that jointly considered IAQ and TC among the elderly. Further, evidence remains sparse regarding the role of indoor pollutants on preexisting diseases common among the elderly, such as particulate matter (PM), bioaerosols, and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Thus, a need exists to examine IAQ, TC, and the health of older persons. The identification of subgroups that are susceptible to pollutants and TC is particularly important for designing appropriate and efficient interventions aimed at maintaining a healthy and comfortable environment.",

No matter how old, the elderly still play an active part in society and enjoy a better quality of life. The challenge is to make the most of the enormous potential that older citizens harbor even at an advanced age (European Union [EU] , 2012). Health declines as people grow old, but much can be done to cope with this decline. Further, rather small changes in the environment may make a great difference to individuals suffering from health impairments and disabilities. Research to understanding such effects, especially taking into account that older individuals often have multiple diseases and live in restricted indoor environments that place them at increased risk of exposure to indoor pollutants, is an important endeavor and a natural shift in the focus of IAQ and TC studies.",

(2003) suggested the need for further studies on indoor pollutants and health in the elderly, including a focus on improved exposure assessment, various short-term and long-term health outcomes, and identification of those characteristics potentially associated with susceptibility of adverse effects. The indoor environment may also affect the development of preexisting diseases in the elderly, an unstudied and potentially important research area.",

These pollutants have been associated with a variety of effects, where airborne bacteria are confirmed or presumed causative agents of several infectious diseases, and also with the development and exacerbation of chronic respiratory illness, including asthma (Peccia et al., 2008) . The same concern was reported in a review by Tang (2009) for fungi and their spores, which may trigger hypersensitivity reactions such as rhinitis, sinusitis, or asthma, and also for viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus with a 50% fatality rate for those over 65 years old. Further, the role of human occupancy as a source of indoor biological aerosol is poorly understood. Size-dependent particle behavior often might be associated with specific chemical and biological components of PM. The strong signal of human microbiological contaminants as far as airborne PM is concerned in an occupied room demonstrates that the inhalation route might be a source of exposure to microorganisms emitted from the skin, hair, nostrils, and mouths of their occupants .",

Low ventilation rates and crowded conditions increase CO 2 levels, and bioeffluent concentrations, potentially including bacteria, gases, odors, PM, and viruses (Mendes and Teixeira, 2012) . With respect to bacteria, inhalation of infectious microorganisms from individuals and animals is a primary mechanism of contagion for most acute respiratory infections.

Our findings show a PPD index of 42% dissatisfied residents in winter, a high rate that may partially be explained by cooler outdoor temperatures found (average of 13\u00b0C) and the ECC building characteristics, including use of natural ventilation, stone masonry, and lack of insulation. Several investigators found that older adults have a lower activity level and metabolic rate than younger persons, and thus require higher ambient temperatures (Havenith, 2001; Tsuzuki and Iwata, 2002) . Further, the ability to regulate body temperature tends to decrease with age (Hoof and Hensen, 2006) . Tsuzuki and Ohfuku (2002) also found that older adults have reduced warmth sensitivity in cold seasons, and similarly reduced cold sensitivity in hot seasons. Physiologically older adults preferred a warmer environment (+2\u00b0C) than younger people. Enomoto-Koshimizu et al. (1997) suggested that a 20-24\u00b0C comfort zone is not warm enough for older adults, and specified an optimal temperature of 25.3\u00b0C for sedentary older adults.",

Not surprisingly, concentrations of CO 2 , TVOC, and bacteria were above outdoor levels, indicating indoor sources, and these and other pollutants (PM 10 , CO and fungi) sometimes exceeded reference levels. Perhaps most significantly, TC PPD index was classified as \"slightly cool\" in the winter season. Although these results suggest that indoor concentrations of most parameters were generally within reference values, the results suggest the need to improve the balance between IAQ and TC parameters. Potentially, simple measures could provide health benefits to ECC residents and workers, such as insulating ceilings, walls, and windows, without giving up natural and passive ventilation solutions that are common in Portugal due to the advantage of the country's generally mild weather. The present study suggests that further study is needed to analyze the interaction between TC and IAQ variables in order to improve the well-being of our elderly population.
